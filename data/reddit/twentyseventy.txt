This is such a childish point of view. If you're investing in Bitcoin to increase your wealth then this is not an all or nothing game. 
Many of the earliest, largest holders of BTC have predetermined schedules for when and how they will sell BTC. 
Even a young, intelligent Bitcoin millionaire (at current prices) preaches caution and asks the community to see the possible downside. 
HODL what you can and what makes sense. But don't risk your financial future or your family's future prospects on the possibility of Future Gains. 
Anyone in this business for more than a year has made a ridiculous return. Hold 99% of your net worth in BTC at your own peril.

No, it really is value that's no longer accessible. It's like burning a dollar bill but, with a finite supply of BTC, the VALUE of all remaining BTC slightly increases (theoretically) since the total amount of accessible BTC decreases

Well, actually that a special character would fail pre-checksum. The existence of a special character, outside the Base58 list, such as 0, or  would automatically cause the address to be invalid. 
The checksum exists so that an address with all valid characters couldn't simply have a character changed by accident and still be a valid address (still possible, much less likely).

Though Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible with a protocol change, right now each BTC can be divided into 100 Million Satoshis. Max cap of 21 Million Coins * 100 Million Satoshis = 2,100,000,000,000,000 (2.1 quadrillion) Satoshis.
2.1 Quadrillion Satoshis / 8 Billion People (let's round up the world's population here, for the heck of it). = 262,500 Satoshis Per Person
So, if everyone owned some BTC, it would average out to about 0.00262500 BTC per person, or 2.625 mBTC/person.
EDIT: Oh, I thought you said 'will ever own any Bitcoin' - here's a fun fact about BTC then, if you want it.

This is the real truth here. Satoshi didn't say 'this will be the next way that the world will transact money!'  
He simply unleashed/donated/bequeathed the technology to the world and said 'do with it what you will'. 
He didn't know if people would use it to trade game tokens, exchange money/currency, or if they would use it at all!
Bitcoin IS an experiment! What would the world do if people could transfer value to one another as easily as sending an email, for a very low fee, nearly instantaneously?! 
So far, the results are impressive. People have made gambling sites, stock exchanges, lending sites. They have founded and funded companies and startups; they have donated money across borders to any organization that they want, with no chargebacks or anyone to tell them 'no, we don't approve of whom you're transferring money to'. 
All because someone gave us the technology to do so. 
WE are the ones who have given it a value relative to the USD, EUR, and CNY. WE are the ones deciding its future!
Most of us are too late to make our millions by mining and hoarding BTC, but we are here in plenty of time to shape the function of this amazing new tool given to us.

Legally, morally, and logically, it's not 100% their fault unless we're talking a blatant, common-sense scam. There is, absolutely, some blame that lies with Gox and Karpeles.

Any half-decent wallet software runs a checksum on the output address and will reject it if it doesn't pass. This transaction was created specifically to go around this checksum and the user knew that this would happen.

If you're looking for a quick or easy return; don't bother. If you're willing to put in time and effort to investigate companies and do due diligence, then this *may* be for you.
It's really hard to make a return in BTC, however. Far more people have lost money than have made some.

Assuming that they open withdrawals in the future:
1) Register at bitcoinbuilder.com (and get verified, very quick process)
2) Deposit real BTC and get GOX BTC
3) Wait until Mt. Gox reopens withdrawals
4) Sell on bitcoinbuilder for some percentage probably in the mid to high 90's
Everyone forgets that, if/when Gox does reopen withdrawals, the price on bitcoinbuilder will spike to .95 - .99 and you'll be able to sell them there instead of actually withdrawing them through Gox

Fingers crossed that this is the case. 
Don't forget that Gox is sitting on hundreds of thousands of pre-acquired customers and massive brand recognition. Obviously their PR and brand value is at an all time low (in the ground), but if a big name did swoop in, replace Karpeles, institute more transparency, and pledge to turn the place around then it really could be a positive acquisition for them.

If you'll agree to that, you should be able to see the utility of a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet generated from a brainwallet private key - I can have an encrypted paper wallet to keep at home / work and, in case of its loss, I still have a (strong) brainwallet passphrase with which to recover the private key.

Well, that's kind of the point. If both parties don't have a bank account, WU is nearly their only option in most places. You're talking between 5-15% transfer fee. Wire transfers, for businesses especially, take a long time, have sending and receiving fees ranging $10 - $50 and a currency conversion fee if they're not in the same currency.

Yes, but the hash rate aggressively increasing will shorten the length of difficulty periods. If the hashrate increases 20% over the life of the period then the period of that block is more like 12 days instead of 14. Over time, this can make a big difference.

I agree with this for the first world. As a consumer, credit cards in the US are easy and have anti fraud guarantees. 
As a simple, everyday payment mechanism, Bitcoin will shine in the third world where banking is rare and/or expensive. 
For the first world, I see it as a remittance or international payment tool. No one disputes that it's cheaper and easier than an international wire. 
Remember, Bitcoin doesn't need to be everyone's everyday payment choice to succeed.

Bitcoin isn't meant to be the only payment system in the world.

Come visit us as and the bitcointalk [Securities]( forum.
I also post about BTC investments at my site, [Coinelius.com](coinelius.com)


Mining is still extremely competitive. There aren't huge deliveries of miners looming like there were from KnC and other companies, but it's still very tough out there.
ASICMiner is the big player in this space and their dividends have been decimated in recent months. 
ActiveMining, ironically, is not actively mining (besides a handful of Avalons). There are millions of dollars sunk into this company and no one knows if they'll get anything out of it.


[There are!](


It really depends on the investment, however there are very slim pickins these days. The exchanges aren't great, so offerings are low. Some companies prefer to do direct shares, which are even more risky.
In short, be careful! Don't put all of our eggs in one basket, be as risk averse as you can, and don't invest what you can't afford to lose. There have been a lot of scams and runners recently. Feel free to PM me if you have some questions about any securities.
@_date: 2014-09-09 22:57:02

Bitcoinbuilder user, yes. I was never an advocate of Mt. Gox , but I was betting against their eventual default (I was wrong on that count, obviously).
I don't know that kind of proof you want me to provide, but here's a coinbase email from Aug 2013 - I've been using them since probably June or July of last year. 
I really would have preferred to keep my real name and my email/online identity separate, but it looks like they were going to 'collide' later this year anyway.
I like coinbase and I use coinbase, I just wish that they were smarter about semi-sensitive data like this. Paypal, for example, doesn't reveal a user's name until you've sent money to them, if I remember correctly.

I know this seems annoying, but trust me - you get further along each time. 
If you've read through a few times and still have questions, post them in the bitcointalk thread. It's a lot easier to answer specific questions than give an overarching overview.  There are already a few good overviews in the first few pages of the thread, I believe.

@_date: 2014-08-28 15:01:23
Me too - it's a great benefit when pitching to possible new merchants.
You're correct that bad actors wouldn't use it because of the 'no-reversals' nature of it. I do think that, when Bitcoin gains wider acceptance, it will lead to some merchants eschewing credit cards for Bitcoin or offering bigger discounts for using Bitcoin. 
Though CC chargebacks for already shipped products are of course a total loss, many companies also have to employ whole fraud prevention teams and sophisticated fraud prevention software, which adds to the cost of accepting credit cards.
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:27:36

No, Krugman actually makes two distinct claims here.
1. "The growth of the Internet will slow drastically", and
2. "By 2005 or so, it will become clear that the Internet's impact on the economy has been no greater than the fax machine's"
These are two separate claims and I refute only the latter. 
And, again, while the fax machine was/is important, etc, etc, etc. it didn't have a bigger impact on the economy than the Internet. 
I use a fax machine every day; I use email and IM as well - this has no bearing on those points. IM and Email are granchildren of faxing services? Sure, why not. However, the point remains. Fax didn't have a bigger impact on the economy than the Internet.

It does, though. Millibit was created because people needed a smaller denomination than BTC, so we had milli-bit, one thousandth of a Bitcoin.

You're going to need a lot more than 1TH/s per second to get out of pool mining. Total mining capacity right now is estimated at 291,000 TH.
There are appx. 144 blocks mined per day, so you would need at least 2 PH (2,000TH) to even think about mining one block per day.
Unless you have seven figures to sink into mining, don't even think about solo mining.

Well, for instance, right now Denmark (I believe) has a form of funds transfer that is irreversible - this is something that we don't have in the US unless you plan on significant fees for wire transfers, which can still sometimes be reversed. So, there's less impetus for someone there to use BTC. BTC still may solve some problems that the Danes have, but not as many as elsewhere per se.
I imagine that **some** first world countries will, in large part, stick with their current financial systems for everyday transactions.
In the US, for instance, we're big on Credit and Debit. I could see maybe the US or maybe some European country(ies) keeping a lot of the legacy financial system in place (again, for everyday transactions, not international funds transfer).
The third world is one of the places that I believe Bitcoin will shine. Kenya is everyone's favorite example, as much of the country uses m-Pesa for moving funds between each other simply by SMS. 
The third world is skipping PCs for internet access and moving straight to mobile. As wireless internet becomes (even) more prevalent in the third world, I believe that people will be accessing BTC via some sort of solution on top of the Blockchain. A company called BitPesa is trying to do exactly this.
Also, the international remittance market is massive. People sending money back home from the US to Mexico or from Dubai to India are paying big fees. Those third world countries that receive a lot of remittances (Mexico, India, many South American countries) are eventually (I believe) going to stop cashing out all that BTC to local currency and eventually co-opt BTC as a second country currency. Much like, in parts of Mexico near the US Border, you can pay in pesos or dollars.

A signed message is actually a way that someone can verify that someone owns an address. 
Someone that wants to prove to someone else that they own an address would create a message like 'This is Twentyseventy and I own this address, signed 6/2/14' (it can say whatever they want to).
They then sign the message with the Private Key from that Bitcoin public address that they want to show ownership of. This generates the signature. Once you plug in the address, signature, and the message to a Bitcoin client, it will tell you whether or not the signature is valid or not. 
Here's a great thread about it:

Cheaper than 1% plus $0.15? Nope. Coinbase is by far the easiest and most secure way to buy in the US.

You're acting as if you're trying to unload buckets of BTC and people are ungratefully snubbing you.
You're using BTC giveaways to promote your site and your business; don't be surprised when people aren't dying to earn the equivalent of forty five cents to promote your business.
I take every mBTC I can get because I also believe that BTC will be more valuable in the future than it is now. But something tells me that there will be more demand for your giveaway if you:
1) Post how much BTC you're giving away (total or per post)
2) Raise the amount of BTC you're giving away per post/RT/whatever
People will jump a lot higher for 5, 10, or 20 mBTC. There was a gambling site a week or so ago giving away .1 BTC to the first twenty three people to try their site with .1BTC (a game which had about 50% win rate). 
You're right, however - Bitcoin **isn't** well adopted yet. If you're setting up a gold site to target the BTC market specifically, you're doing it right. If you're setting up a gold site to target the normal market with BTC payments, you're just another face in the crowded marketspace. BTC won't be an advantage there, but possibly a disadvantage.

Well, brainwallets are considered to be insecure because of the ability for those with significant computing power to brute force them or to use common phrases to access the private key, no?
So, from a purely computational standpoint, someone would need to generate in excess of 65^36 private keys to have a chance at brute forcing it, correct? Assuming that it's never been published on the internet, in a book, etc, etc.
Not being argumentative here, these are genuine brainwallet questions that I've had - few people are willing to go further than 'brainwallets are a bad idea' (and in many cases, they are).
@_date: 2014-04-27 18:20:26
There's no 'returning' bitcoin. The transaction just sits unconfirmed for forever, or the user attempts to double spend it with a fee included.
This would be accomplished by importing the private key into another wallet or web wallet and then spending that same coin again. This new transaction will gain priority over the old transaction with no fee and then be mined into a block. The old transaction will then continue to float in the ether for eternity, never to be confirmed.

Ah, ok. It's mentioned somewhere else, but the whole Fiat-Fiat arbitrage or goxBTC - fiat arbitrage is here:
1. Deposit fiat to Mt. Gox (this can take a while, so not advisable) - this is optional if you already have BTC in Gox
2. Register on bitcoinbuilder and send your GoxBTC to them
3. Sell Gox BTC for real BTC
4. Withdraw real BTC to Bitstamp
5. Sell BTC on Bitstamp and cash out the fiat.
This is how you can get GoxBTC out of Gox - the arbitrage works if you can sell your GoxBTC for more than the GoxRate/Bitstamp rate percentage.

I remember that, and I appreciate that. I believe that any tip of 1mBTC is sufficient (these days). I'm not rich either, and I appreciate any tip of significant size to me.
I just take issue with the 'be grateful for any tip' plea, because I would feel insulted if I received a tip of 10 bits, like I have seen quite a few times. If that transaction was submitted to the blockchain, it would be rejected by miners because it is literally seen as so insignificant that it's not worth transmitting. Maybe I'm just getting worked up about nothing.
My average tip size with Changetip has been about 1.5 mBTC; I am grateful to those who have tipped and I never expect to receive a tip. The tips go into my long term BTC savings.

Previous bonds like XBOND were doing .05% per day, which is about 17-18% APR. I've seen some new ones, like rentalstarter, doing 6%.

Well, the paper wallets would actually be useful if provided to someone in the case of my demise, as it's easier to have them remember the BIP38 password than asking them to remember the brainwallet passphrase. 
But, yes, at that point you could simply create multiple BIP38 wallets and make sure you always know the location of one.
I'm admittedly no expert in entropy; would you consider a 65+ alphanumeric character passphrase on the better side of security for a brainwallet? I know, of course, that any brainwallet is substantially more easy to 'crack' than a non-brainwallet.

It happens each time there's a sizable increase in price - those who have been hearing about it finally decide to make the plunge. 
It's self-reinforcing, to some degree. The increase continues to be fueled by new money and the cycle continues until it doesn't. 
It's fun to watch the sentiment change as an increase comes on - the tone here was much darker two or three weeks ago. After a while,  you can see/predict the increases (or I just had a lucky guess a few weeks ago).

Just like it is with any cash payment; with any payment there will be risk taken by one of the parties.


That's your opinion; while it may be a severe negative for you, others may be willing to accept that risk. You're also speaking for all consumers across the world, of which there is obviously a subset who already disagree with you.


It's at this point that I know that you're no longer serious. The consumer is not always right. Oftentimes the consumer is wrong.


Not true. Merchants don't kowtow to every consumer's whim or Amazon would have free one day shipping on all items and every merchant would accept American Express.


This point of view is limited and short-sighted. It's my opinion (yes, my opinion) that Bitcoin's best benefits are NOT for a merchant-consumer relationship; its best benefits are, as I said before, for cross border transactions, whether they be remittances or payments that would normally be serviced by wire transfers.
In both of these cases, irreversibility is a non-issue because neither remittances (Western Union, Moneygram) nor wire transfers are reversible (by and large; some wire transfers can be reversed in very extreme circumstances). 
Many first-world consumers with credit cards will continue to use credit cards for these type of transactions; I personally enjoy and utilize the antifraud features myself. But don't make the mistake of thinking that this is Bitcoin's only utility - think bigger.
Clearly we're quite far apart from each other's views on Bitcoin. If you're not just trolling, hopefully you've gotten a new perspective on why people think that Bitcoin is useful. If you are just trolling, then I appreciate you helping me hone my Bitcoin debate skills. 
We may just disagree with each other and we're just going to have to [deal with it](

The highlights:
Here’s what you can do to avoid phishing attacks. Try one or more of the suggestions below:
* Use two-factor authentication. This is not sufficient, but makes it harder for attackers.
* Use the secondary password (Under Account Settings/Security in the Blockchain wallet), which is required to send funds out of an address. This is also not entirely sufficient but again makes it harder for attackers.
* ALWAYS check the site is protected by SSL certificate. This is not sufficient, but makes it harder for the attackers.
* NEVER click on a login link in an email, Google Ad, or use Google Search to access blockchain.info. Type it in yourself or use a bookmark.
* ALWAYS type blockchain.info into the URL bar yourself, carefully checking for typing errors
* BETTER: Use a bookmark to blockchain.info on your bookmark toolbar instead, this is the best and most foolproof way.
* BETTER: Use the Blockchain extension (add-on) for Firefox or Chrome. This is an application that contains all the Javascript and is the most secure way to access the Blockchain wallet
* Do not install extensions or add-ons you do not trust as these can hijack your browser or replace bitcoin addresses.
* Use a different browser for every-day browsing than the one you use for access to blockchain.info. For example: Use Chrome to browse, and Firefox without any add-ons (or with only the Blockchain add-on) to access blockchain.info. Or the other way around, use Firefox for general browsing and Chrome for wallet access.
* Do not use Internet Explorer. Just… don’t.
Love the IE dig at the end

Yes, normally there's a hard limit for securities or cash/cash equivalents.
My Homeowner's policy, for instance, has the following limits:
* $200 for money, bank notes, bullion, gold other than goldware, silver other than silverware, platinum, coins, stored value cards, smart cards, gift certificates and medals.
* $1,000 for securities, accounts, bills, deeds, documents, evidences of debt, letters of credit, notes other than bank notes, passports, stamps and tickets.
I don't see any other category where BTC would be (possibly) covered.
EDIT: Unless you're considering it 'stored data':
* $3,000 for computers, including hardware and software accessories, operating software, application
software or other similar software, which can be replaced with like kind and quality on the retail
market. This includes electronic storage media such as, but not limited to, tapes or diskettes. **Stored
data is not covered.**

It's hard enough to do fiat P2P lending - see Prosper or Lendingclub. Also, they send people to collections when they don't pay (unless they file bankruptcy, which does happen). 
BTC lending means that people face exchange rate risk (if they're cashing it out or exchanging it for services) and that there's no collections company to go to if they don't pay.

Don't worry, the stock market will be on the downswing soon enough. The cheap cash flowing into the economy from the fed is causing a new asset bubble since there's only so many places for those dollars to go. 
The stock market has made a full recovery, real estate is back on the upswing and silicon valley valuations are at an all time high. Why? Because the economy is doing gangbusters? 
No, because the flood of cheap dollars has made people desperate to find a return for those dollars and the opportunities for real return have been increasingly diminishing.

He's still incorrect - the index was set BY the banks themselves (as a group) - that's how LIBOR works. It's not as if the banks are setting the BTC price by coming together and comparing notes; NYSE is just reporting a price, not setting it.

One of my first thoughts. Not sure if you can do intra-Bitstamp transfers like you could with Gox. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 22:12:03


Herein lies the crux of what we're talking about here, I believe. Since those that will be mining in 2016, at the halving, have invested so much time and money into their high dollar, likely centralized, operations, they will be super cognizant of the impending halving.
I believe that the profit motive here, and the large capital outlay needed to recoup costs, will make it much less likely that 50% of the network will suddenly shut itself off after the halving. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:14:16

It doesn't affect me nearly as much as it used to. Sure, it's sad to know that my total BTC value has decreased on paper. But after seeing $1000 BTC, after seeing 1mBTC valued at one dollar, it's nice to feel like I'm getting a discount on the future. 
I was a buyer at $70, and then $1,100. I was a buyer at $800, $600, and $400. And I'm a buyer at $275. 
Unless you think that BTC will never rise above $1,000 again, you're getting a discount.

Well Litecoin is a different beast, isn't it? Much of Litecoin's rise in value against the USD was its close association it its BTC linked value. 
I was surprised that the LTC/BTC rate remained as similar as it did during last fall. I hold a small amount of LTC because I think it may have use as a daily use crypto to Bitcoin's probable use as a reserve currency used for large transactions.

I've been waiting for this moment for a while now. Very sad that someone has been kidnapped, but it's a sign that the criminal element is paying attention to BTC.
I've fully been expecting kidnap ransom/hostage negotiation payments to start taking the form of BTC attempts. No more bags full of cash and a helicopter, not more 'bring the money, but not the police', just a simple TXID and they free the person.
@_date: 2015-01-09 14:48:34
This was my thought as well - those that believe that they might be insolvent would clearly choose the BTC option (assuming BTC withdrawals are enabled) thereby raising the price in a Gox-Fall-2013 type scenario.
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:49:48
Those are actually two great reasons. The macro effects of merchants and miners selling BTC cause constant downward pressure on the price. 
New VC funding and merchant acceptance announcements don't affect the price like they used to because these signals used to be a sign that BTC was gaining some mainstream acceptance - which it now finally HAS. Tigerdirect and Newegg accept BTC. Coinbase has raised three rounds of funding, the last at nearly a half billion dollar valuation. 
You can buy more than alpaca socks these days with BTC. VC firms and big money backers are funding Bitcoin companies. 
Bitcoin continues to improve its mainstream appearance and, as it does, each step up seems to matter less. Combined with the sell side pressure from BitPay and Coinbase merchants and mining rewards for miners desperately trying to recoup costs, this all points downward for the near future.

I remember when I finally, finally looked at BTC seriously in June 2013. I watched millions change hands in minutes as someone tested a $50 buy wall, and hard. 
IMO $200 is low, $500 is low, and $700 is low. My price horizon for 10 years out is, and has been $5K - $25K. It might take longer than that but I highly doubt it will stay under $1000 for the next 5 years. Just a thought! 
It was fun to buy half a coin for $120 last year though. Buy when you can.

I believe that it's important to set the ATH as the price achieved by the most prominent exchange at that time.
In April, Mt Gox was the undisputed champion - the price topped out at $266, so I'm calling that the new all time high.
Once Bitstamp (who isn't plagued by Gox's withdrawal issues) reaches $267, I'm calling that the ATH.

As was explaining, a mining pool breaks up work and issues it out to the miners. This work is a called a 'share'.
The miner does their allotted work (hashing a certain number of inputs) and then resubmits it to the pool. The pool then provides another share, and the process repeats.
So, the pool looks at the number of shares that the miner resubmits over a time period (1Min/5Min/1Hr/etc) and bases the hashrate (normally listed in MH/s (MegaHash per Second) or GH/s (GighHash per Second) upon the average number of hashes over that time period.
So, the miner doesn't report any hashrate, the pool figures it out from the number of shares submitted back to the pool.
MegaHash = 1,000,000 hashes
GigaHash = 1,000,000,000 hashes

Difficulty just increased about 28% this time. Let's assume that that rate increase is constant bi-weekly for the next 10 weeks. That does bring us to 50M difficulty, after which you'd be mining .0453/day at 4.5GH/s, which brings about a 3-5 month breakeven. Not great, but I'd be surprised if difficulty increased at 28% clip.
This is why the 64 chip is a better investment; the assembly doesn't cost 4x as much (at least through Terrahash), and it puts your breakeven at about 1-2 months. Thoughts?

Really what you're 'storing' in the wallet are the private keys to your wallet, which associate with a certain public address.
You can copy that wallet and put it on whatever computer you want. I actually have my electrum wallet set up at home and at work as well. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 11:43:18
In order to 'seize' the coins, you would have to obtain the private key for that address. They would be 'seized' by moving the coins to another address, to ensure that the seizer was the only one who could control them. Since they have the private key for the new address, then, yes, they could be spent. 
Just like the Silk Road Seized BTC.

It just depends. As pointed out, it was mined six seconds after the block before, leaving very little time for new transactions.

It seems that most of the commenters here have little idea of the differences between Scrypt and SHA256 hashing. Whether or not you think ASICs are 'abusive' to the system, the answer to your question is 'Yes'.
Altcoins using Scrypt require more memory to perform the hashing calculations, so ASICs are not well suited to Scrypt hashes; GPU miners are better suited to Scrypt hashing because of their built in memory caches.

I disagree. I believe that it is you that aren't seeing the big picture. 
What if I told you that, chances are, BTC won't be a success because John Q can pay his electricity bill with BTC. It will be a success because people can move money across borders, without government or financial institution interference, any time of they day or night, every day. It will be a success because immigrants to the US, or to Europe, or to the UAE can send money back to their homeland for nearly FREE instead of with a 10%+ surcharge. It will be a success because you can finally hold a currency that CAN'T be devalued by a central bank or debt issue.
These are the puzzle pieces of the big picture. People shouldn't care if .0023 of their 1BTC was used to buy marijuana. Or if the 1.5 BTC they hold was stolen ten steps ago. For those law enforcement entities that want to try to track stolen funds, more power to them, but making some BTC worth less than other BTC simply because of the reason it was transferred from one address to another goes against what is trying to be accomplished here.

It may seem that everyone here is being very negative, but they're very right. The time for profitable mining was before April. It's not worth it to mine BTC unless you have $100K to sink into development and even that doesn't guarantee a profit.

Yes, but the miners a decentralized group, not a centralized group (at the moment). However, this doesn't have anything to do with anyone guaranteeing backing value to BTC (like government-backed currency).

Unfortunately, I don't know of a good step-by-step for altcoin mining, which can have a few differences from BTC mining. A good starting point would be [Multipool]( (an altcoin mining pool). Their Getting Started section isn't bad. You can CPU Mine, GPU Mine, or both (if your setup can handle it). I used minerd for CPU mining, mostly.
Don't get frustrated if you can't get everything perfect on the first day, normally it takes some doing and tweaking. And nearly everything can be helped with a good Google search!
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:51:14
Um... .14 is only like $150 today. If you mined a block, ever, it would be at least 50 BTC

Personally, I would go with the 64 chip because it's looking like the assembly won't cost 4x what the 16 chip assembly will be. 
TerraHash estimates .75 BTC for the 16 and 2 BTC for the 64. However, they're not doing any assembly yet, so we're dealing with incomplete information
Overall, the worst case scenario is that you spend 4x as much capital and hash at 4x the rate. This is only a big problem if the hashrate increases even faster than expected.

It's essentially that the buyer has a certain time period to complete the transaction. If, for some reason he can't, then he forfeits the deposit because the seller, at this point, has likely refused other offers and will be out time, money, and opportunity if the sale doesn't complete. 
Some sellers are more flexible than others as well.

Hey man - yes, even with a new, top of the line CPU or GPU rig, you'll be earning less than the electricity it takes to power your computer. You will not be able to cash anything out even after a month of 24/7 mining. 
The mining arms race has left everyone in the dust. It's not even worth it to buy specialized ASIC mining hardware these days, most products (especially Butterfly Labs!) will not return what you pay for it.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:18:11
In practice, miners can see what the predicted next difficulty would be and turn their miners back on. 
Also, the difficulty increase would have to be MASSIVE for these miners to actually turn off their equipment, because the would literally have to be paying more in electricity than the BTC they generate for them to turn it off.
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:40:57

Right, I'm not saying that no one should buy any Chinese real estate. But the limited amount of investment opportunities in China has lead to a massive real estate bubble, to the point where whole cities of high-rise apartments have sprung up with people's life savings. No one is living in these thousands / millions of vacant houses/apartments/condos. They're just going to written down / written off and the Chinese public is going to lose a ton of money - in fact, they've technically lost it already, the loss just isn't realized (both literally and in the financial sense) yet.

I never said that it did. I was just stating that some might see division to eight digits as a barrier to value increase, which it is not. If BTC are worth $10,000,000 each, you can keep drilling down to get smaller fractions of BTC that are more manageable in real life situations.

It may be worth it to mine some altcoins - the chart here should show you an estimate of what they card will do for MegaHash/second - 
I mine altcoins and then convert them to BTC and LTC, it's not much, but I think BTC will be worth much more in the future, and LTC has a lot of possible growth potential.
Cryptsy.com is great for exchanging altcoins to other coins.

BTC isn't meant to be the end all, be all for transacting money. If you want chargeback ability, you should continue to use credit or Paypal-like services (I love the consumer protection that credit offers).
BTC really matters when you're talking about money transfers across borders. How many legitimate buyers in Nigeria or Indonesia can actually get items shipped to them because of the insane fraud coming from those countries?
How can I send $1Million+ to someone in less than an hour? On the weekend? After business hours? With a fee of less than $50-$100 total?

This isn't practical with a normal market with many buyers. How, exactly, is she going to sell at $280 when the market is at $100? The market either has zero depth or she has to have a massive amount of coin. 
Even if she has a massive amount of coin, she would lose money from the slippage of the price.

If you have equipment to mine already (a computer(s)) then you could mine Alt-Coins! Multipool.us will automatically have you mining the most profitable alt-coin, which can then be exchagned for BTC at cryptsy.com

Yes, this is right. The larger it is, the harder it is to gain 51% of the network to launch a malicious attack.


And this is why I am asking what is the easiest way today to be physically part of the mining community and in this context if there is a device that you can advise.
Looking forward to hearing feedback about the ideas above.
I respect your want to help secure the blockchain, but CPU and GPU mining will literally make you dust. You'll never be able to withdraw the satoshis that you'll earn. Even a Block Eruptor (check eBay), which runs at 333MH/s isn't really worth it unless it's free. Even then, you won't be able to withdraw the miniscule BTC that you've earned.
If you really want to help BTC grow, consider running a full node. All you have to do is download Bitcoin-QT and leave it running. This way you're able to help people broadcast transactions and download the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:26:20

There are and have been multiple services to do so. However, BTCJam doesn't have any way to recover funds besides arbitration (non-binding), Coinlenders (which paid interest on deposits) recently closed down and took a lot of users' money with it.
I do BTC stocks and bonds, two big exchanges have closed down recently, leaving mostly Havelock Investments and Cryptostocks as the two main exchanges. However, neither has a good fixed-rate bond, as Havelock's listed XBOND was just forced bought-back by the issuer.

A large incoming wire transfer doesn't necessarily mean your account will be frozen and everyone will freak out. 
People routinely wire $100K+ to other bank accounts. It might raise some suspicions if it were happening every day, but, then again, you shouldn't have more than $250K in any US bank account.
Cash out in a few different transactions. The $10,000 limit that triggers notifications to the IRS / bank officials is for CASH DEPOSITS.

Fair doesn't really matter to me. Is it viable as a currency and/or commodity? 
That's what matters to me. It may be different to you; Bitcoin means different things to different people. Just like the Internet did/does.

Coinbase isn't an exchange. There are not multiple buyers and sellers, just coinbase and it's customers, so there's no bid/ask etc. 
Coinbase based it's prices somewhere around Bitstamp and just uses those for it's customers. They make money off of fees for buying and selling it to/from their customers.

I just don't think that BTC will necessarily be a consumer-focused currency, but a B2B and international remittance currency. However, some countries whose consumers can't participate in ecommerce right now (like nigeria or some eastern european ones) will use BTC, as they can't use credit cards or anything of the sort now.
I think that businesses and banks will be the ones to really utilize BTC most and will have appropriate safeguards in place. It's more about them then getting grandma on board, in my opinion.

How exactly would you purchase 100, or, say, 1000 BTC with Coinbase?
@_date: 2013-12-15 13:24:09
Many people mined back in the day and lost their wallet, formatted their drives, etc. the coins back then we're literally worth no money. So, anywhere between 10% and 50% of all coins are unspendable because the keys are lost. Once the keys are lost, they're gone for good. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 11:39:26
All of this would indicate that you didn't do enough research on mining or purchasing BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:33:29
Large amounts should be kept on (multiple copies) paper wallets if you're going to store them for a long time, or on a cold wallet. Use the 'Security Guide' on the sidebar if you're looking to set up a super secure method (keeping the wallet on a USB-boot OS, etc).

Yes, if the 26K BTC were not reintroduced to the money supply, all other BTC would become more valuable, as they are then that much more scarce. It's hard to put a number on it, because it depends on a lot of other factors.

That is true, considering that's what ASIC stands for! You're correct; I was speaking more of the currently designed SHA-256 ASICs, which people have just started to call 'ASICs'. But a Scrypt ASIC would need more memory than a SHA-256 ASIC.

@_date: 2013-11-25 14:08:54
Here's a great topic on how to do it! 
However, running a 'full node' is running a wallet that contains a full copy of the blockchain. Lightweight wallets, like electrum or multibit, use a third party server to verify transactions, not by actually referencing their copy of the blockchain stored on your local computer.
You then connect automatically to other people that need a copy of the blockchain (P2P), much like a torrent.

Coinvalidation keeps all BTC from being equal, which is one of the main advantages to the currency. It's irreversible and universal - there's no such thing as 'counterfeit' or 'bad' BTC.

Okay, then, if you're located in the US, then you need to use Coinbase to set up an account, get Level 2 verified (bank account and VISA Credit card) and then you should be able to buy instantly.
Make sure that you buy just a little more than 2, like 2.01, so that you have money for transaction fees.

I understand that, I just wanted him to know that it really isn't worth it, even for the network. The network is hashing at nearly 5,000 Petahash, so even thousands of block eruptors won't be but a drop in the bucket.
There are more efficient ways to help BTC and the network than iota-scale mining. However, if you just want to learn about mining, more power to you.
However, if you really want to learn, consider mining an altcoin and then exchanging it to BTC (or keep it).

Absolutely. I would say that MOST people lose money on the exchanges. They keys to success:
1. Understand everything you invest in. I had to re-read the DMS Prospectus four or five times until I got it.
2. Watch the market's attitude. Unfortunately, it's like investing with a bunch of 13 year olds sometimes - if a bunch of people freak out, can you take an unrealized loss for a while until the price recovers?
3. Will the price recover? If you did your research, you should have at least an idea of what kind of yield, dividend, etc that the security should yield. Make sure you've got the balls to hold until then, or: 
4. Know when to cut and run. If an investment is going south really quick, just get out. Use your head and decide if people are just spreading fear and uncertainty to lower the price or if there has been a fundamental shift in the underlying security that warrants selling.

You can say that the "Internet" has benefited humanity in many ways because it is AFTER you've seen its major effects! After the major change in society that it has caused!
Bitcoin is just beginning. This is like the Internet it 1992 or maybe 1995, not 2013.

I believe that one or two of them will survive and become profitable eventually. So, you could either mine all of them (again, I'm using Multipool, which automatically mines the most profitable altcoin), and see which ones pan out, or you can mine them and then convert them to BTC or LTC.
My setup tops out at 200KH/s, and probably averages around 125KH/s... It's not going to make me a millionaire, but altcoins have such a great capacity for growth, that I think that I'll come out ahead in the end. Don't forget that people used to mine BTC for fun as well - they didn't know it would be worth $250 some day, or even $1. 
I also get free electricity, so be sure to account for that.

They're called the 'unbanked'. People that mostly cash their checks each week. They're a huge market segment. That's why banks are really getting into offering loadable debit cards, to attract this market segment.

It doesn't have anything to do with the ticker in Siri, I was responding to your claim that they don't understand it. They get it, and are excluding it from the App store because they don't want any competing payment systems in the iOS ecosystem. Paypal gets a pass because it would do more harm than good to ban them.

Don't know much about growcoins, but  2 and 3 should have been obvious. 
MCX has been very suspicious from the start and reeks of a Ponzi scheme. The IPO? Massive and undersubscribed, if course the market price is going to tank
Cryptsy? It says in the prospectus that the early divs will be given bonuses and, after that, they'll drop to lower levels. That should not have surprised you if you read the prospectus. 
Don't mean to sound mean, but you need to do some more research before investing in things Iike this.

To be honest, I met him once. We were both taking a minute to talk to Tony Gallipi, the BitPay CEO, and he was just a total suck-up with nothing original to say. He seemed really full if himself.

We're about to see a 15% increase this round and that's the smallest I can remember for at least 2-3 months. Lots of companies have hashpower coming on in Dec/Jan and, I believe, that it's going to keep increasing exponentially for a while.
It will stop increasing at that rate when only large scale operations ($500,000 - $1,000,000) are profitable.

Yes, even if you buy 51%, which is a multimillion dollar project, you still have to have them mine with a protocol change. Otherwise, nothing changes. Am I missing something that you're trying to explain otherwise?

Good on you for doing that, it's always good to have someone out there introducing it to the newbies. I'd be sure to mention that mining really isn't worth it these days, as everyone's heard that it can be generated with your own CPU/GPU, which is long over.

About Seven Billion. If the total supply of Bitcoin is 21,000,000, and only ten percent is 'free', then that's 2,100,000 coins.
2,100,000 / 7,000,000,000 = .0003BTC per Person. 
.00030000 BTC = 30000 Satoshis, so every person in the world could possibly have 30,000 Satoshis even if 90% of the supply was constrained.
If it becomes a problem, they can change the protocol to make it divisible to sixteen digits instead of eight. 3,000,000,000,000 (3 Trillion units) should be enough for humanity to use.
If not, they can change the protocol to utilize more digits.

Surely. Surely they'll sell? 
They've been holding since $1 or $10 or $100. What makes you think that all if these people, that have seen a 10% or 100% or 1000% gain will bail at $1000? Do you think that they, especially those with a large amount of coins, many if whom probably mined them themselves, think that BTC will have reached it's peak then?

THIS is why BTC will be successful. While everyone is talking about waiting for six confirmation for buying a coffee, the real innovation is here!
Someone just transferred $155 MILLION DOLLARS yesterday. Instantly, for 37 cents. No BS, no banks, no paypal, no credit cards, no hold, no waiting.
The real change here isn't for buying coffee or paying a friend for dinner. It's about large money remittances! This is why it's going to be huge! Because, right now, it's a bitch to move $600,000 between three US banks. It's a bitch to pay your supplier in China while you're in Europe. And it costs a lot more than $0.37 to do it.

Yep, that's what I would do
@_date: 2013-10-01 18:58:46
Electricity is provided at no charge in his area. Mining is typical (in my book) IF you're talking about the power consumption running 1-3 computers or small-grade miners. I would consider that within the normal household's electric usage. 
It seems that you've made up your mind that him using his computer for mining is stealing, but I wouldn't consider it to be a violation of the social contract unless he's using a LOT more than a normal unit. There's some gray area here, but it becomes a lot more white when you're talking about small scale and lot more dark when you're talking large scale.

How, exactly, are they going to 'stop' BTC transfers? The miners would have to be party to those decisions.
And, yes, redlisting or refusing 'tainted' coins could come to fruition, but it will be up to the individual receiver of a transaction whether or not to accept a certain BTC payment for something, not the community at large.
