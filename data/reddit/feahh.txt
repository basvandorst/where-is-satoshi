Congratulations. You have paid 13.5% to learn a lesson.  
Don't take it badly, lessons often cost.

Glad you got your funds back!  
Quick question though. Is it required to update firmwares on the ledger? I've put my ledger away in a safe place and if I don't NEED to keep taking it out to update it, I'd rather not.

That really depends.  
\- You could try leverage trading. (Risky)
\- You could try day trading. (Risky)
\- You could try Altcoins. (Risky)
\- You could try pump and dump schemes. (Risky)
\- You could buy BTC every week/month to increase your bag. (Not risky)
I think you  get the point I'm trying to make here. Your goal is to gain more BTC, there is no shortcut there without taking risks. If you're up for it, go for it. However, you could end up with nothing.
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:03:32
Just stick to ATMs.
Yes, its more expensive. But it sounds like you have no other legal option.
Good luck!
@_date: 2019-07-22 04:08:31
Ive never experienced them holding funds.
WHEN I used them, I would always get my BTC almost straight away.
@_date: 2019-07-04 03:32:40
Honestly, selling and rebuying is much smarter than just hodling...or is it?
It makes perfect sense, sell high, buy low, rinse and repeat.
The problem is no one knows the bottom or top, it is more a less guessing.
Yeah, you could increase your stacks...but you could also loose them.
Hodling is just plain safe and a sure way to make gains with minimal risk.

We need a bit more information.  
Are you actually in Korea? What is stopping you from using regular Korean exchanges such as Coinone or Korbit?  
You asked any 'other' trading platforms. What have you tried so far and why don't you want to use it?
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:54:26
Wouldnt a face to face meeting and direct transfer of payment be better?

I live in Korea. I've been using Coinone with no problem. You have to have a registered NH bank. Having said that, I'm not sure if foreigners can register anymore.I've used Korbit aswell in t he past, there were no problems with it either.
\*EDIT\* I wouldn't recommend Bithumb, they've been hacked in the past

2 questions.
How is your life affected if you lost all of it? If it's bad, don't do it. If you can brush it off, why not.

So to my understanding, the safest way to test my wallet is to:
* Buy a second wallet and use original seeds to restore
* If it works, my seeds are correct and one wallet should be erased.
* If it's incorrect. Move funds to a freshly initialized device with a fresh seed key and try again.

Why, when you want adoption, you write snarky comments to someone who is interested in joining the very ecosystem?
OP, I dont know how much you know, but bitcoin is many things.
It can be used as a payment system to transact between two parties without the need for a middle man (the bank).
It can be used to pay for things or transfer money very quickly across the world for very cheap.
It can also be used as a store of wealth, like savings in hopes the price will go up in the future.
There is a lot of good material on youtube and books such as The Bitcoin Standard that is a wealth of information.
Goodluck on your journey!
@_date: 2019-08-23 08:03:59






Yes, that's the point I'm trying to make. The banks offer us a service at a cost and most people are happy to pay that cost for the banks to help set up an account, transfer funds, pay for services/bills etc.
My question was, how would those, who find it difficult to set up a wallet, store keys, scan QR codes, transfer funds or generally have questions, go for help?
Take into account that there is a high chance Bitcoin will be easier in the future, none the less, where can people who are not into technology go for help?
@_date: 2019-08-01 15:27:05
Suggestion? Yes. Don't let your dick make decisions again.

@_date: 2019-06-16 12:37:18
Honestly, Bitcoin is just too difficult for the average user to buy, sell or trade.  
It needs to be simple enough for someone who is not tech savvy to be able to use to send/receive/pay.  
The idea of personal keys, public keys, blocks, ticket sizes all need to be working seamlessly in the background and all the user sees would be a QR code to send or receive to.  
I feel that [UnstoppableDomains.com]( is helping the market go in the right direction. Bitcoin is still in it's infancy, and like any early technology, it will take time before it really becomes user friendly for everyone.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:53:13
Oh come the hell off of it!
How many people using bitcoin would still use it if there were no gains to be made?
It is an entire movement, yes, but if people couldnt profit off of it, then nowhere in hell would it be as big as it is.
Another point you seem to misunderstand, is that I never mentioned using it as a primary income.
Im not here to argue with you but atleast dont put words in my mouth.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:24:27
This was brilliant!
@_date: 2019-02-19 01:20:27
Good answer mate and correct on all levels!
There is a lot of infrustructure being built. A lot of institutional investors getting ready to move aswell as BTC ATMS popping up all over the world.
The appeal of bitcoin is growing in countries such as those in S.America where their currencies have failed.
A good one or two more years of consolidation would prove to the smart money that it is safe and stable.
I really hope prices stay around this level until ATLEAST mid to late 2020
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:23:33
Wait, as far as I remember, when you first initiliaze your device and it asks you to write your keys.
It then asks you to confirm your keys.
So, at the first stage, your keys were correct, no?

Yes, that is true, just as is the case with miners mining at a loss.
Why are people and miners doing it? Because they believe that it WILL, in the future, be of profit, not because they (most of them) want to overthrow the broken banking system we have now.
How about we both respectfully agree to disagree, bud?

Its like a rabbit hole, how secure do you want to be?
Keep it on a hot wallet.
Keep it in cold storage.
Keep it on paper.
Memorize it.
Use inception style mind protection.
I feel having half of your seeds in 1 location and the other half in another location is secure enough.

Wow...now that is a bullish reply, one I completely agree with. Loans, should not occur.  
Even though I agree with it, I don't necessarily believe it. Greed will always exist. The temptation or convenience of having now and paying later will never be gone (unfortunately).

@_date: 2019-09-29 01:29:31
Hey man. Good job for getting into crypto, it's a fascinating space!  
I'll try answer your questions and make them as simple as I can.
1. Choosing your wallet depends on what you will be using your bitcoin for. Will you be spending/transferring often or just holding? If you are an active spender and don't plan to keep a lot of bitcoin at any given time, a mobile wallet is fine. Have a look at youtube for recommended mobile wallets to get some idea. IF, on the other hand, you plan on storing/holding your bitcoin, a hardware wallet is highly recommended. I use a Nano S. Think of it like a bank account where you store your savings. It's not useful for daily use since you need the device every time you need to send money. Hope that clears things up a bit.
2. In regards to buying coins, there are 3 main options. The first is to use a service which is connected to your bank account, I think coinbase is a common one (I live in Korea so I use Korean exchanges). You would transfer money from your bank account to the exchange and use that Fiat money to buy your crypto. These usually have the lowest fees for buying/selling but you need to have a lot of identification ready. The second option is to use services like coinmama to buy crypto using a credit card. These are usually expensive and charge 10% for the purchase. However, this is the easiest option if it's your first time in my opinion.  
The third option is to use a service such as localbitcoins where you and the buyer/seller trade between yourselves and also set the prices yourselves. I've never used localbitcoins, but it seems popular.
3. An exchange is simply a place to exchange one coin to another. A lot of exchanges are not connected to bank accounts, they are really to change one coin to another. Binance is very popular and trustworthy, I used to use it a lot. Just remember, like a lot of exchanges, you can't cash out to your bank account. I'm not sure if Binance has added this feature or not, it's been a while since I was on it. Just keep in mind that there are 2 types of websites for trading, one that deals with fiat, one that doesn't. Ones that deal with fiat will usually allow you to transfer to your bank. Again, have a look at youtube and find some good exchanges that you want to use.
4. When it's time you want to sell your bitcoin, (and I assume you mean to sell for fiat currency) it's probably easiest to sell it on places that are connected to your bank account. That way, you sell your BTC for Fiat, and then transfer that Fiat to your bank account.
@_date: 2019-09-23 08:58:13
It depends man, it's your money at the end of the day.If I can throw in some advice I'd say the following.
It sounds like you enjoy gambling, and that's fine. Just as long as you're not spending more than you can lose.
We all here believe that BTC will moon one day. You should really look at the end game price of BTC and ask if it's worth gambling THAT away in a very risky environment for more jet fuel than you already have.
I don't gamble at all, I have an addictive personality which is why I never go near casinos. Having said that, I was tempted, a year back or so, to take a portion of what I invest into my HODL stack into a gamble. I would keep playing until I lost a portion, repeat again the following month.
However, having said I have a addictive personality, it would probably not have worked as cleanly as I thought. And thus, I don't gamble.
@_date: 2019-09-27 06:36:25

I visited their website and had a look at the product, really interesting!  
No need for a paper key, fingerprint can be used.  
Can also have a beneficiary register their fingerprint in case.  
Standard edition price around $200 if you pre-order.
@_date: 2019-09-15 10:02:56
Jave you ordered from them before? I cant remember their % but, Coinmama charges you % and their third party payment system charges you a % (usually both charge same amount, 2.5% and 2.5%)
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:22:42

You take a picture of a random person and post him on the internet to show adoption is coming.  
You don't ask for his permission.  
You don't blur out his face.  
And then, the same community bash him for the way he looks?
To the man in the T-Shirt. Good job, thanks and have an awesome day if you ever get to read this!

I don't understand your question.
  
\- Unless you are living in a country suffering from hyper inflation
\- You don't want to use banks
you are asking how you can get paid in a way which is (probably) much less common than your national currency.  
Regardless of what you choose to do, why not get paid in your national currency and buy BTC?
