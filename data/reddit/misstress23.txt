It’s called segwit

Probably not easy enough for your parents but very easy for your children

Sorry but no, we need more nodes, not less
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:17:41
It’s very risky in case of an attack where the users could be fooled into an hard fork (for example increasing inflation issuing more than 21 million bitcoin) without realizing it.
The bigger % of the network is using full nodes to verify the less chance there is for an attacker to even attempt such an attack.
But if we drop under a certain threshold incentives to try an attack like that became too tempting

Blatant lie
Customers ask about cheap and faster transactions.
That means segwit
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:18:57
Bitcoin is divisible into 100 millions of units called satoshi.
You can buy 0,01 for like 150 usd that is equal to 1 million of satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:27:37
This is the correct answer
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:14
Every time you buy there is someone selling bitcoin for dollars or euro
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:33:55
Worst part is that bitcoin.com wallet will not support segwit addresses so even if the kid is able to access his coins he will not be able to use segwit transactions with that wallet.
Put some sticky on that atm pointing to a segwit wallet like greenaddress 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:28:56
Every time someone buys a bitcoin for usd or another currency someone else is selling btc for usd.
This is a marketplace.
So you sell it where you just bought it if you want.
1 Bitcoin is divisible in 100 millions of a smaller unit called satoshi.
Just like 1 dollar is made by 100 cents.
You can buy or sell  0,01 btc for like 150 usd which is equal to 100 million satoshi 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:43:13
Bumping the block size now would kill any incentive to adopt segwit.
And that is a huge problem because we really could use segwit optimization.
Even though blocksize increase makes sense we need to adopt segwit first imho
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:53:31
Please post the transaction id so we can actually see how many satoshi per byte you payed.
Consider keep waiting if you are not in a hurry.
Eventually your transaction will be forgotten (and you can try again) or included in a block

You can actually buy 0,1 of bitcoin for 1500 usd or 0,01 for 150 usd

Absolutely avoid coinbase. They are super shady and not trustworthy.

No one knows for certain 
Otherwise there would be no gains to be made or losses
I am positive it will work somehow because I want to see the bright side.
If you ask me my % I'd say we have more than 40% chance to actually succeed in be one of the methods of payment in the future so that mean more than 500k for each btc but it will take at least 10 years I think to get there if we hit that 40% chance

Most probable reason is the complete absence of empty blocks mined.
In the past there were a lot of empty mined blocks but after segwit this stopped
Probably covert asicboost was turned off and so now we have more space 
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:05:39
Greenaddress by blockstream is the right name I believe 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:14:44
The more bitcoin value goes up the more stable it will be because as soon as big money invest in and big retailers accept it no one will need to sell them for fiat anymore.
People will spend them directly the same way they spend dollars.
So that will definitely stop a lot of activity and trading over btc 
Of course the price by then would be very high

Just buy a small fraction of a bitcoin and try to use it. 
You can buy stuff on the internet or real shops.

@_date: 2017-08-16 22:13:58
Try greenaddress 
It's very safe and easy a lets you set the fees
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:34:22
No for 2 reasons.
Best developers work mostly on bitcoin. Usually it works like bitcoin developers create stuff that is copied by other crypto
Also if another alt coin has a good feature bitcoin can implement it as well
For example smart contracts that were made popular on ethereum are now on bitcoin as well using Rostock side chain
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:33:12
Not really.
Bitcoin is actually valuable because you can trace it from the first time it was mint and all the owners of it till now
That’s how the blockchain works and why we know for certain that there will be 21 million bitcoin forever and not one more.
The value comes from the fact that you can send money everywhere in the world without permission from any government. 
No agency can stop a bitcoin transaction, they would have to bring down the internet.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:18:27
If there aren’t already this is a nice idea
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:19:18
It’s because bitcoin is still in price discovery mode and also is still partly in development.
The base layer is ready but second layer is not ready yet.
So this means it is a usable medium of exchange but it is not ready yet.
Eventually it will stabilize and will be probably used.
In japan it’s considered a legal currency and in a province of Switzerland you can pay almost all your taxes in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:04:29
How about: bitcoin is the plural form, Satoshi is the basic unit.
So if you have many satoshi you own some bitcoin.
Owning satoshi is not very expensive really

I have no trouble at all using bitcoin chain, especially using segwit compatible wallet.
The only time you have any issue is when there is an attack going on by those that want to take btc market cap.
Devs and random people from BCH space have openly admitted of doing such manipulation 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:26:23
Yes you can.
For Android phones go with electrum wallet.
For iPhone best one is greenaddress but it doesn’t support bitcoin forks at all so it’s very hard to split and sell Bitcoin Gold/diamond and all the forks that will come.
If you want to be able to access those go with bread wallet
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:40:15
If you do a little bit of research (and I guess you did when you decided to invest) you know 100% that bitcoin and BCH are totally not comparable.
BCH is a fraud.
they are trying to pass as bitcoin to fraud people, as many as they can cause that something some humans do all the time instead of working honestly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:34:15
This. 
1000 this
Might be worth to post this as new post instead of a comment
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:00:32
No because there is no government behind bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:26:04
Coinbase is one of the most easy to use but also the most expensive and slow.
You should try kraken.com
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:38:06
Holders of btc hopefully realize that the issues are temporary and mostly caused by dropping of hashing power thanks to pump of BCH 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:45:38
IMHO People seriously questioning fiat money will always be a very tiny minority.
I don’t think we can count on people to adopt bitcoin due to loss in faith in fiat.
What could happen is that, as bitcoin surge people will (and have started doing it already) investigate in it and learn that something different can exist eventually leading to a different status quo. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:49:36
Multisig transactions are definitely smaller
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:48:35
It will but right now the problem is that it’s still a new investment.
As soon as the market will discover a stable price the volatility will be almost over and you will be able to use it as a currency.
It will take years to get there but consider how much time it took to merchants to adopt credit cards.
bitcoin is so much undervalued right now that you have swings like last week where price surged by more than 10% in few days
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:08:48
If you are using Electrum it’s very simple actually.
-Make sure you have the latest version of Electrum
-create new wallet with segwit
-send your bitcoin from old address to new segwit address (it starts with bc1)
-from now on all the transactions on the new wallet will be segwit and have very low fees
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:07:10
Many wallets and some big exchanges have not upgraded to benefit from segwit.
Make sure to use a wallet that is updated to segwit.
It’s going to be alright
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:09:36
If bitcoin could be attacked by ISP it would not be worth much.
Remember bitcoin main feature is censorship resistance. 
If any ISP try to block bitcoin traffic you will just be able to encrypt it so no big deal.

Yes it’s visa fee.

Is coinbase using segwit addresses to lower fees?
Segwit is a increase in network capacity and we will have more in the future
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:45:39
What do you mean with is there a limit?
Right now there are almost 17 million bitcoin in existence for certain and few more will be mined in the next decades till we get to 21 million total bitcoin.
You can’t fake them or create more because there is a public ledger copied in thousands of computes that track every bitcoin from the moment it is mined and all the transactions done with it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:04:36
Yes fiat money means exactly that there is a state, a government behind it propping up or down its value
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:24:41
There is a finite amount of bitcoin and there will only ever exist 21 million total.
It’s also impossible to create fake bitcoin because they are tracked every time someone spends them.
So basically you can give it value because in order to trade on the bitcoin network (blockchain) which is borderless and global, you have to have bitcoin and so you have to buy them or earn them.
To buy them you usually offer dollars euros etc so by doing this kind of exchange bitcoin can be valued in usd

To be honest the way I see it is that it is less profitable than buying coins (especially if you live in a country where electricity is expensive).
But the thing is that, since I believe in the long term growth of btc I think mining is definitely a good investment.
Yes it’s true that it is strictly a less good investment that just buying the coins, but since btc benefits enormously if the mining is decentralized (look at the incredible service Slush pool did keep mining Btc even though BCH was more profitable) you are still protecting your investment and making sure it will reach its full potential one day.
So I’d recommend you start some mining activity provided you can afford to invest in ASICS 
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:14:53

I’d say don’t worry to much about miner fee that the customer has to pay.
Just give the customer a small discount because you don’t have to pay credit card fees.
If the price of the goods they are buying is small you can accept 0 conf transactions as long as they payed a decent fee.

@_date: 2017-09-27 22:22:10
in some countries (Venezuela, Cuba etc) its much better to hold bitcoin than the national currency. especially because holding dollars is prohibited by the government
so sometimes even swings like those we saw recently don't matter much because bitcoin has some features that we never saw in any other currency or asset

True, but it’s much safer and easier to hold bitcoin than anything else you mentioned.
Especially because btc is easily divisible so you can just sell (to pay for daily expenses) a small amount (instead with currency bills or potatoes it can be harder)

The problem with mining is that there are companies that do it at a very large scale.
The machines that are on the market are not good enough.
Just think for a second... why would they sell the machine if it was still profitable for them?
The reality is that companies that develop the chips for mining are always a step ahead of what it is on the market.
They are using the new asic 10 when you can just buy asic 9.
When they release 10 on the market it means that they have developed asic 11.
Now don’t get me wrong, you can still profit a little bit if you are lucky enough to buy an asic as soon as they sell the first batch and your electricity costs are low but the hassle and risks are usually not worth it.

Segwit2x is in reality a Hard fork to 8mb 
miners say 2x because they will only create blocks of 2mb at first but they are free from that moment to create blocks of 8mb whenever they want thus completely centralizing the network because it would be impossible to keep a full node to verify the blockchain because it would use too much bandwidth.
only very few computers would be able to be a blockchain full verifying node if blocks become bigger than 8mb
