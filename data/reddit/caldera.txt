Top guy myself - I’ve run the numbers - he’s nearly dead on at 40% for me (and I have deductions I make) - I come out to 40.6%  and live in CA.

I never said I do to the fed gov. But he could live in a household that makes &gt;$470k not to mention about 90 other ways his federal tax portion could exceed 40%.

We should just tumble all our income in bitcoin and cash it to bhat and move to Thailand

so... your response is that you cannot actually explain yourself. I literally asked you to explain yourself and your comment was “sure” with no explanation. You did manage to cop-out about explaining something by mentioning me attempting to a win an “internet argument lol.” and “changing my argument” when I stayed straight on the point and further clarified makes me think you’re not very good at this internet arguing lol.

care to explain? i said my outlay is 40% in outgoing taxation and that is lower if i didn’t have some deductions - i’d share my spreadsheet that explains the sane mathematics if it wasn’t so personal. what was the point of your comment exactly?

Big oversight on my part - so you can only input money in Gox but not remove?
@_date: 2014-01-06 23:32:20
While I clearly detect your sarcasm - I would prefer a more intelligible answer.  I (now) understand that MtGox won't let you withdraw - is this the only reason for the fairly consistent difference in price across the two exchanges?  Further question would be: Are other exchanges where you can withdraw from consistently different from one another?  My guess is no...

Thanks. I hope you never stop living up to your username.

I too used dwolla and Mt.Gox back in the &lt; $5 days and am just now re-orienting myself with my old account when I had this silly revelation and typed up the reddit post without researching much.  Happy to have some smart folks around to correct me and speculate the reasons for the price differences :)

I love these dick measuring contests because it's SO easy to prove what you have: 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:18:44
you showed (or really well didn't show) everything right there. thanks for the laughs man :)

I can't count how many private forked repos I have for work I can't bother contributing because of the modifications which are too closely coupled with proprietary code or would serve no value to the community.  Add to that what value would some folks have to add that to the core rather than remain nameless and/or watch and see?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:25:25
LOL.  Yeah the world solely exists to contribute to open source projects when a great majority of companies and people operate at a level of keeping their best interests and that of their families and shareholders.  Not to mention the legal shitshow - come to think of it I really don't even know what your word garbage was meant to get across?
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:48:32
You just said I just said word salad rather than actually knowing what I or even you are talking about.  To that I say terrible job done.  Move along.

I get all that - I know quite a bit about the tech and background and cold storage etc etc.  I actually wonder what economic forces or external pressures or other events would cause Bitcoin to drop to $0.  Realistically.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:22:18
i've been out of crypto for a couple years (left around $700) and i groan every time i see the latests.  starting to really honestly wonder: what COULD go wrong short of a vulnerability which by now surely would have been found given the stakes.

I haven't been able to spend these troy ounces yet, but I find great utility in them: namely the storage of my assets albeit skeptically with chance of growth and later easy conversion to fiat currency (maybe I wont even require this later)

Honestly for those that want bitcoin to succeed as a replacement online currency we need easy to use "bank" replacements like Coinbase to serve as a conduit for fiat &lt;=&gt; BTC that are really easy to use.
I admire what he is doing but setting up your own server or hosting solution in the cloud with your bitcoin wallets is going to be way over the heads of most.  Even if this is a sort of "diaspora" meets bitcoin - I think the project is pretty limited in possibilities and ultimately the trust will lie with the cloud provider, a third party like Drake who hosts smaller group of bitcoin wallets, or on hosting providers to keep hosts up and available and not crash losing bitcoin.  That is still a lot of trust to place in other parties - I think hosting something with a company like Coinbase is going to be much more for the masses and the best for adoption and uptake for BTC.
The problem with these sites (so far) is they are not regulated, FDIC insured (for example), and in their fine print may hold no accountability to account holders.  And they are still a bit away from making it easy to use BTC...
