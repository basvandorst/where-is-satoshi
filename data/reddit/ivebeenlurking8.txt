Yea I read and everyone was recommending taking it off coinbase, which I did, but I was wondering if I can make some profit by putting it back on coinbase, getting the equivalent in 2x, and selling that off, using that profit to buy regular Bitcoin, why not. But   I'll wait untill people say thats a good idea before trying that.

Yes I keep my btc in a paper wallet, but just found out that paper Wallets are vulnerable to replays after the fork and thus not safe, so I'm currently trying to figure out a safe place to store my btc, that isn't a trezor as I cant shell out $150  CAD as a college student. Any recommendations?

How do u check your bch balance if you have a paper wallet? And if you wanted to sell it off how would u do it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:07:56
Good to know, any apps or sites u recommend would be safe from that type of attack that isn't a trezor since I cant really afford one right now (College student)?

Is blockchain an exception?
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:24:12
So basically you can put your btc on there, get the equivalent in fork, and sell it for free?
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:14:49
Thats what im going to do do for now, but another redditor told me that coins would be vulnerable to a replay attack during a transaction.

Awesome! Thanks for clearing that up, this whole ordeal is making me anxious about Bitcoin, but hopefully it gets past this and we head to 10k by the end of the year!

Im not the most educated on crypto, but trezor is a usb storage device right? And if i have my btc on a paper wallet, would that matter?
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:34:48
Ok but if I had 5 pre fork in coinbase, and i get the 5 of the 2x coin after, cant I sell my 2x coins and use the money I earned to buy original btc?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:24:43
Thanks for the information!
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:32:10
How bout to leave it there temporarily, get the 2x coin and sell it off?
