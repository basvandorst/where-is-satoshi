I'm waiting for a bigger drop between day 10 and 16. It has happened in the last six years or so... If it doesn't happen I'm buying more anyway. (Edit: apparently January sale has already begun!)

I'm so saving this, lol.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:11:53
I don't think those people should have bought in first place, then. It's unreasonable to invest money in something you don't really understand.

Ride or die, baby

I check it at work, sometimes I forget to look for a day or two. Might be because I'm not really interested in selling in the next ten years, tho.

Same and same

It started all with a tweet, how did it end up like this
It was only a tweet

With perfect use every time, it's 98% of efficiency.

This, precisely. I don't understand why some people talk about Bitcoin as if the world's going to end in a few months. We have literally years ahead and cryptocurrency isn't going away anymore. I've been steadily buying it since November last year and IDC that Bitcoin will not recover in 2018 - this is not a race. I'm making a lifelong investment and I don't actually plan on selling everything ever. If ppl bought in the hopes of getting rich within a year I can only lament...

I commend you for even trying to argue with that user. He/she just keeps replying shit after shit, like they don't have actually any idea what they are talking about (to be honest it's starting to sound like a case for And I've seen so many comments like theirs recently on this sub... Got me wondering what is going on. I don't even know anymore if this sub is full with people who lost money with Bitcoin and got angry at it, or fearmongers, or just plain old trolls...

Lmao great pic! Nowadays I forget about it so often that a meme on here will make me check it, lol. About 1 or 2 times per week. I was getting paranoid so it's better for me to just let it run its course.
@_date: 2019-06-16 15:41:50
Lmao that was mean... They can get a bicycle, come on.

I swear to God this subreddit at this point has more plain ol' Bitcoin haters than people who are into it, or even into critical thinking. The amount of comments like "but Bitcoin is useless/valueless" Ive been seeing here is staggering.
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:42:06
Seriously I only know two people who know Bitcoin or just the concept of cryptocurrency. Nearly all of my co-workers and relatives are still trying to get a grip on how to use their bank app, lol. Talk about saturation...

Well, $5 can pretty much buy only two types of joy: ice cream or heroin. Hope they choose wisely.

I don't believe it's gonna drop as much, but I do think it'll hover around 2300 at the bottom. Bitcoin consistently melts between Jan end and February so I hope new users hold on tight their coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:08:46
Pretty much what I did. No ragrets.

Last week I had to send 900 bucks in my currency to a friend who's visiting another country, the only option was via Western Union. I paid a whooping 120 bucks to send it! Really unbelievable.
@_date: 2019-09-16 16:59:07
I love how that comment implied that everyone who oughta buy bitcoin already did in 2017 LOL. Bitch please, literally no one I know IRL has any bitcoin, lots of people haven't even heard of it and so many are still grasping the most amazing aspects of cryptocurrencies. We are still in toddler phase, far away from the "end" of FOMO.

I'm sold and waiting mid January to buy again and invest a bit more. (And there it comes the downvoting bots!)

Idk what's all the fuss about, it's gonna drop even more in January and February, as always. Enjoy the chance to buy more! It's what I'm gonna do anyways...
