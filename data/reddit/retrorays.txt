I'd certainly like guidance on this also. Tried talking with different experts. Get different stories. Btw, it's far more complicated than BCH. It's *all* hard forks of Bitcoin. Some of them are clearly scam. How do you define the fair market value of each hard fork? Futures may not be correct. Which market do you use? Easiest is 0 cost basis until sell but if IRS goes the other way... then could cause massive confusion

Ah I see. Well my take is the fair value at release was Aug 1st at around 400-700 per coin. Tbh, I think you'd be perfectly fine specifying even 400 per coin. Either way, when (or if) you sell your BCH you'll pay the appropriate tax at that point. Just because coinbase was slow in enabling people to withdraw your funds doesn't mean you didn't get them earlier. 
Btw, Aug 1st this was the range -&gt;

Tbh, after much research I think this is incorrect guidance. There were many hard forks of bitcoin in 2017. Last count like 10+. Are we supposed to account for each "scam" hardfork, even though (1) fair market value for each is difficult, if not impossible to determine, and (2) the actual value of the hard fork is now 0?  It seems to me someone could do a fake hard fork, set it at whatever price they want and screw over everyone.

I'm confused by something. The fair value of BCH Aug 1st was around $500-700 per coin. Where do you get $4k-8k?

Bitcointax says they are using $277 as the fair market value. I'm not sure if this differs if you had your funds in coinbase, however.
