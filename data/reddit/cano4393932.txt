This is a hilariously sad back and forth

Yep, doesn't seem like a shitcoin, the opposite in fact

First of all, Nano was given away for free- there was no ICO, or private sale, so there's no possibility of an exit scam, it's a fully open sourced protocol. They would only be scamming themselves at this point, for all the work they've put into it.


You still need to decide which other pool to join, though, it's slim pickings unfortunately, mostly Chinese run pools. The methodology of it is similar to why Nano works so well, you can re-delegate your vote weight at any time, for no cost, to whomever you trust.
Nano is fully asymmetric, so the only limit on scaling is bandwidth (the cheapest component out of all the metrics. Disk I/O, Memory, CPU etc). Bitcoin is unfortunately forever going to be 7 TP/s, locked in by the protocol.

You are grossly misunderstanding. You're confusing the ledger size somehow with capacity of throughput- Nano can process many more transactions per second than Bitcoin can, it's limited only by bandwidth. Maybe you should do some research before you dismiss things so quickly.

That’s why Ledger pruning is being implemented fairly soon for Nano, so you don’t need to download/verify the entire chain. Nano has over 30million transactions and it’s ledger is only 15GB, that’s nothing. It takes about 1-2hours to sync that for a full node. LN scaling is irrelevant because it’s a second layer, you still need BTC or another coin underneath it to be fully sync’d in the same way.

How can I explain this more easily for you - every account holder has their *own* blockchain, therefore there is no single chain that forms a bottleneck for the transactions. It's asymmetric. Everyone is adding to their own chain and it's being confirmed by the consensus mechanism (which is now extremely efficient). It's completely different to traditional blockchains (i.e not UTXO or account model)

That’s not a mistake, that’s just how it is - a pool is managed by a single entity, the miners themselves don’t have a voice unless they mine on their own (which they won’t do because it isn’t as profitable). That’s called inherent centralisation. Nano doesn’t suffer from this, as adoption increases, the vote is more evenly spread amongst principal nodes.
Anybody is free to spin up a node and ask for voting weight, that’s not centralised.
The Nano developer fund is about 4% of the total supply, which is enough at the current valuation to give them another 2-3 years of paid development. Hardly a joke.
Don’t be blind to other technology because of your own bags.

It's actually ORV now (Open Representative Voting), which means you can choose who votes on your behalf, something that's not possible with Bitcoin. It's also now more decentralised than Bitcoin if you equate mining pools with Node weight. Which makes it no more susceptible to an 'attack' (if you mean a 51% kind of attack). You should try it out before dismissing it as a shitcoin. I would recommend Natrium and one of the free faucets.

It scales because you can process thousands of transactions a second instead of only 7, limited by bandwidth only. If you think it’s a scam because the ledger grows over time, then you must think Bitcoin is a scam too, right?

Do you know anything about it?
