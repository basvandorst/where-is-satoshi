If other coins could not do it better, you would have a point.

He does not have a choice to not pay taxes if he wants US dollars.

Your missing a important piece.
The reason people are currently in bitcoin is to get rich. Not to use it as a currency, or any of the tech.
Bitcoin will continue to sink. It's just how it is.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:54:20
No we are not. You are probally the 99%, just like me.
The 1% ers are the people who own the most amount of bitcoins. They are the true, and valuable 1%

Do you know what "world means"
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:58:38
The main thing people buy stuff with using bitcoin is drugs 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:59:17
Bitcoin is not continually rising.
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:43:20
You are probally the 1% of usd holders also if you account in the whole world 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:22:30
Do you know what the main way to buy monero is?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:53:19
Yea it's definitely not that the price of bitcoin went way higher then it should do to people buying last month
It's not crashing, it's correcting.
@_date: 2018-01-15 06:46:11
This is true if you hold the crypto for years plus. Without your subject to short term tax at 39
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:08:58
I hope your trolling 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:57:54
If you actually have close to 1 million to cash out you should at least be smart enough to hire a good person to do your taxes

You can go on the internet talking about how great bitcoin is while it takes 30$ and 10 hours to send a transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:34:26
I'm sure they have time for your project
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:17:19
Comparing bitcoin to any type of rare physical thing (like a watch or painting) is completely wrong.
Bitcoin is valued because you can store mass amounts of money with it and never have anyone know about it, and you can make completely untraceable transactions.
All of this is valuable to criminals. Bitcoin people today will tell you that it will crash if we can't get rid of these fees and use it in the real world.... truth is it is and has always been a currency for criminals.

Called being a retard 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:24:47
This joke has now turned very ironic because you can apply it with fees 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:17:31
Not true
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:31:18
Credit card and debit card purchase are different right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:08:06
It takes about 10 days.

Since I did not send in my id to Coinbase, I am only allowed 5000$ a week in, and withdrawing 10000$
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:30:35
There are tons
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:51
I see what your point is. I think a big reason why certain paintings become worth 100's of millions is in a way to preserve value in a way other than cash.
Bitcoin is similar to that, other than the fact that there truly is a advanced technology behind it
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:38:10
It takes time to get the physical bitcoin code. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:40:00
Too long. 
1. Download Coinbase.
2. Click buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:29:42
Yea only intellectuals know how to go on the internet and buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:55:12
That is irrelevant for a beginner who is looking to just throw a couple thousand at bitcoin
