Hypocrite.  If the whole point is about decentralized currency, the price of BTC or XRP in USD is moot.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:53:29
Nah, I'm hanging around so that we reduce the casualties when it crashes.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:19:20
Fair enough.  When there are enough believers, a lie becomes the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:47:49
What's the grand idea of cryptocurrency?  That it will replace fiat?  :)
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:10:22
You are clueless.  The only way the price will go up is when there are people willing to pay the higher price.  And if everyone is only willing to pay bargain prices, it will remain at bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:13:43
A State controlled bubble is far better than a bubble controlled by anonymous whales with zero accountability.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:21:21
It can't be useful as a currency if it's volatile (which most people here loves).
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:03:01
Probably the South Korea news.  Point is - the value of BTC is purely speculative.  If there are enough people believing and willing to pay $1m, BTC will be worth $1m.  If there are enough people believing that it's only worth $1,000, they will cash out or won't pay for more than this and BTC will be worth $1,000.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:37:00
"Correction"?  Oh please.  Correction is when price is re-evaluated based on value.  And the value of BTC is?
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:43:39
Get real.  This market is all about the whales cashing out as smoothly as possible before it crashes.  Everyone else is just riding the waves this created.  If you have figured this out, then it's obvious that holding is a poor strategy.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:34:38
Just cash in and take profit if you are ahead.  Nothing to fuss about.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:52:07
To you, everything else except a moon trip is FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:07:24
Wrong again.  Korea has capital gain tax and today, BTC gains are not being taxed.  With the new regulation, it gives the visibility required for taxing to happen.  Nobody cares about the small flies.  It's the traders and whales that will run.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:02:07
The price is holding steady as the whales are still cashing out.  Once done, the crash will start.  There is zero reason why price will go back up.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:45:00
The crypto funds?  Zzzz ... that's just another new cottage industry jumping on the BTC wagon and playing with someone else's new money.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:50:13
To the newbies that are being encouraged to buy ... don't listen to them.  They want you to buy to prop up their losses.  Stay away.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:08:36
Gosh ... you seem to think that any FUD or whatever here will have any meaningful impact.  It's what the whales (who own 40% of the BTC) do that counts.  And the smart bet is that they are cashing out in a manner that doesn't rock the boat too much.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:06:56
Good grief!  You seriously think any of these anonymous traders paid a dime of tax?  Seriously?
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:00:15
Why do you think it's a big deal for the Koreans?  I would assume that the only people who should be concerned are those using BTC for illegal transactions.  Which at this state, should be a very, very small number.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:17:54
Dude, if you own $80m of BTC and knowing that it's paper money in a bubble ... what will you do?  Well, there's a 1,000 of these dudes controlling 40% of BTC.  So ... what do you think their game plan is?  Kind of obvious.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:12:31
Months?  When the first exchange goes down due to lack of liquidity, how long do you think it will take for panic selling will set in?  It will be over in hours and days, not Months.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:05:32
Why don't you just sell it for cash and use the cash to buy BTC?  
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:00:53
You are a clown.  If fiat isn't important, why is BTC measured against it and people here gets hysterical when it devaluates against fiat?
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:02:02
16m BTC is about $253B.  $2,855,950,000 = $2.85B.
That means roughly 1.1% of BTC was traded, which seems right when compared to an average stock in the stock market.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:00:02
Wrong, $400B is the value if all BTCs can be sold at that price.  Did $400B of fiat went into it, nope.  Let me tell you how it works - 90 people paid $1 for 1 unit each.  Last 10 people actively traded 10 units and boosted price to $1,000.  Total $ pumped in = less than $10,000.  However, total market cap = $1,000 x 100 = $100,000.  Got it? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:58:14
The right advice is to hold only if in red and sell/take profit if you have made money.  Holding for the sake of holding is sheer stupidity.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:14:23
Ever wonder who's sponsoring all those ads that tells you to buy?  It's from the people who wants exit and need liquidity ..... i.e., your cash!  The imaginary $300B is a mirage unless there are enough retards pumping in the money.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:58:09
Dude, if you don't even have a bank account, it's a safe assumption that you are gambling with money that you need.  Stay away from BTC in which case as you can't afford to get burnt.  No offence intended.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:27:35
  Feel free to brush it off as fake news created by the big banks and other conspiracies.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:09:50
Bots are doing their job.  Taking a big order and slicing them into bite sizes.  This is how the stock market works so no magic here (or conspiracies).
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:03:39
Price is dropping!  It's a dip and solid time to buy buy buy!!  Of course it's not a bubble!  BTC is going to change the world and you will own the world with it!
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:02:54
Dude, if you can justify the price for BTC, then you are right - it's not a bubble.  At present, it's priced based purely on speculation and can be anything people are willing to pay.  It can be $10 or $100,000.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:07:49
You seem to believe there are some conspiracies.  Well, maybe the truth is boring - price of BTC is based on speculation and when there are enough people getting nervous and cashed out, the price went down.  It's really that simple.
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:03:40
Name me one good use of BTC as a currency that can't be met with fiat and a good electronic transaction system like Visa.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:15:20
To do what?  There are plenty of suckers but unfortunately, the sucker pool is still finite.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:35:48
What are you talking about?  It already went to 13,800
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:05:58
BS.  The volatility has killed adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:13:39
Cashing out to fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:50:00
Define mainsteam.  High adoption as an alternative currency to fiat?  Or institutional funding?  I doubt if either is going to happen; at least not within next few years.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:07:14
hodl and buy more!  mortgage your house, pimp your wife or sell your kids if you have to!
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:32:13
It's wallets, not just addresses.  And if these wallets belong to the exchange owners, you got a lot more to worry.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:56:59
What's the point?  The 21 million is a man made artificial limit.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:23:11
lol ... then short sell on futures.  CME's Jan contracts are standing at $14.47.  you will make a huge killing on margins.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:27:39
Such hypocrisy.  If you truly care about newcomers, the best advice you should have given is that the price of BTC is purely speculative and it's now a bubble by any definition.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:40:20
You can still make some money by shorting the futures into March.  But of course, there are risks involved.  Don't leverage.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:51:36
Yeap, you figured right - BTC is no longer viable as an alternative currency.  It's now the Dutch Tulip of our century.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:01:58
Uncle Sam accepts only USD for taxes.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:59:40
Yes, it's a bubble for the simple reason that BTC is itself close to little value and priced way above this.  But there are too many people in denial here so you and I will be called trolls, FUDs, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:18:33
I'm less ambitious.  I just want to own US$1 billion, not a fraction of it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:46:21
Thanks for the info.  Yeap, 1,000 top wallets containing an average of US$83m.  If you are holding such a wallet, get real - what would you do?  Obviously to cash out without crashing the market before you are done.  Then go buy real stuff with real money like a couple of lambos and yachts.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:47:13
Well, seems like any bearer of bad news is a troll to you.  Let me try something simpler - one of the earliest BTC transaction was 10,000 BTC for 2 pizzas.  What has changed since then that a BTC should be worth $12,000?
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:33:52
Sorry, that is BS.  If hedge funds want a piece of the action, there's no regulation against that and I haven't heard of any who's interested.  As for futures, Cboe and CME has zero stake in the game and they make money from the trading (in USD).  Upcoming ETFs?  Same - zero skin in the game - they make their money (in USD) managing the ETF.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:05:21
Absolutely.  Because nobody has been able to ascertain the value of BTC so it's price is driven purely by speculation.  I.e., the price of BTC is whatever people believe it is and is willing to pay for it.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:42:40
*cough* .... haha :).
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:12:12
LMAO!  It's just an opinion and frankly, you are just as clueless (which describes almost everyone here).
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:19:10
Wake up guys.  1,000 people are holding 40% of the BTCs.  Put yourself in their shoes - probably 10x returns, millions in paper worth and sitting in a bubble.  What do you think they want?  Obviously to take profits and cash out to safe havens.  Their only problem is do so gradually so that BTC won't crash altogether.  No, they are not idiotic enough to believe there will be enough new comers paying increasing higher prices for a commodity with little real value.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:02:20
Pullback?  lol .... Yes, it's the smarter ones who are pulling out and getting real cash.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:42:07
haha!  You sound just like Trump.  Everything that he doesn't like to hear is fake news and FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:12:55
If entire crypto market is red, that simply means people are selling at lower price (i.e. dumping) for fiat.  It is common sense but the zealots will call this a FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:27:04
Thanks, yes.  My belief (happy to stand corrected) is that the Price increase was driven by speculative trading and has little to do with increase in the underlying Value.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:23:43
Keep holding till it crash.  Meanwhile, the whales are cashing out and buying their lambos.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:15:16
Tax ... good one, didn't think of that.  Not sure if South Korea has capital gain tax.  If they do, it is a very, very big deal.  The whales will want to cash out or try other means to avoid the taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:28:09
Sell if you are ahead and hold till your max loss tolerance if you are not.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:22:49
Same whales pumping in a little to keep the price up while they dump.  Yes, a lot of them know each other to coordinate this game.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:00:51
Bitfinex is trading at almost $1,500 lower than GDAX and yet, volume is almost 3 times higher.  Anyone knows of a good explanation for this?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:51:07
I can't agree more.  But too many clueless idiots calling this a FUD and encouraging losses by people who can't afford.
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:17:23
You know when it's done when the fat whales are gone.  In the meantime, the pump and dump will continue.
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:23:55
Wow.  I won't if I had to.  We don't tax capital gains here.
