@_date: 2018-01-27 11:38:52
Some of the transactions were sent back to users' accounts due to the high delay in payments processing by our payment partner. To give you access to your money, we have turned the funds back. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:45:35
Kindly clarify whether the issue still persists.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:28:51
Definitely, we understand your concerns as far as we are dealing with your money. Currently, we have actually stopped the registration of new users to resolve the large backlog of tickets we have. Besides, people do not usually go to forums to tell that something went great. You can see that literally every exchange is currently experiencing problems with processing the complaints. 
Anyway, we are doing our best to solve all the issues, and we promise to process each and every ticket that we have in our system. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:47:03
We have escalated your ticket directly to the finance department. Please note that such a delay may be caused by the longer time processing of payments by our payment partner. We would like to assure you that you will definitely receive your funds. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:41:39
CEX.IO is definitely not a scam. We are working hard to ensure the processing of the backlog. 
Many of our customers already had a chance to ensure that we do our best. 
The issue is that we encounter the rapid growth even despite the fact that we have closed the registrations. No business may be ready for such a growth, and it can be observed also on other cryptocurrency exchanges. 
We understand that working with the money of our users imposes high responsibility on our company, and we strive to ensure that they can trust us.
 We kindly ask to give us some time to resolve all the issues. The fewer complaints we encounter, the faster we will reorganize our processes. 
With your help, we will be able to overcome this complicated situation. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:21:02

This situation may have been caused by the fact that we have had our MCC changed recently. As it appeared, some banks take additional commissions for this. Nevertheless, the MCC was changed once again, and the situation should be resolved now. 
As for Coinbase processing payment, it should be a mistake.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:43:20

Kindly tell us your user ID or ticket number, we will try to clarify the issue. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:42:40
If you have found the transaction on the blockexplorer, it means that the transaction was already completed on the side of CEX.IO. It requires the confirmations on the blockchain, and there is nothing we can do at this stage. Regretfully, you will have to wait until the necessary confirmations are received. It may take longer due to the high load of the Bitcoin blockchain. Kindly inform us when the transaction will be received on the destination wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:25:53
Unfortunately, there is not much we can do at this stage. Nevertheless, we are looking for a way to boost the transactions, and hope that it will be possible to realize it soon. We expect everything to start working properly within the nearest few days.

Dear [**u/wsheep**]( 
Thank you for commenting.
When the user activates 2FA on the account using Google Authenticator, there is indeed a code to be kept.  It is the backup code and it may be found next to the QR code. If the user saves the code, it might be manually added it to the Google Authenticator application on another phone to restore the access. However, it is not applicable if 2FA is set up via SMS/Phone call option.
Thank you for understanding.

While we have already won the trust of thousands of customers, the cases of dissatisfied clients are not as frequent as it may seem after reading the posts on forums.

As we posted earlier we will be making an official statement soon.
@_date: 2014-09-08 03:22:25
Hey GoldenBiscuit,
Buying GHS gives you 2 opportunities to be profitable, firstly from the mined rewards (which you can re-invest or use to purchase other coins / BTC) and secondly from the ability to sell your GHS at a future point hopefully for a profit relative to your original purchase price. For instance, for the past 30 days or so GHS has traded from a low of 0.0033 up to currently 0.0038 (about 15% increase). 
It is always about timing though when it comes to buying and selling, so it is important you set some goals beforehand and realize that it might not be profitable every-time. 
Good luck.

As a provider of cloud mining services this question is a good and needed one. Our answer is that always look for a provider that does more than just sell fixed term cloud mining contracts, these just lock you in with no flexibility. 
At CEX our GHS cloud mining can be bought and sold instantly, combined with many other crypto trading choices on our platform. Also before investing you should look at the reasons why cloud mining is right for you.

Dear [u/AltitudinousOne](  
Thank you for taking the time to share your concern with us.   
We are sorry that you are disappointed by the latest experience of using our platform.  
Let us please inform you that in order to trace the funds which were deposited to the wallet on our platform but never arrived to it, although confirmed on the Blockchain, we need the transaction hash and the sending wallet address. This information can help us to locate the transaction and process it manually.  
However, in case a user makes a withdrawal from our platform to an external wallet and doesn't get the funds after the transaction being completed both on our end and on the Blockchain, the only way to resolve this situation is to contact the recipient's wallet support. Usually, they are able to find and process such transactions immediately.

We didn't close mining. Users can always join the GHash.IO mining pool with their own hardware. Moreover, while the cloud mining is temporarily suspended, meaning that user's GHs don't mine automatically, it is possible to turn the cloud mining on manually (at user's own consideration).

Yes, the Bitcoin price might differ from that on other exchanges. However, we don't set the prices on our own; the price depends strictly on our traders' offers.  
Also, unlike most exchanges, our exchange does not have the buy-sell spread, which means that we do not earn on our users by setting the artificial price difference between the buy and sell offers.
@_date: 2016-05-13 10:05:19
