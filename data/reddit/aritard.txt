Bro. We all had to start somewhere. Might as well welcome and try to educate him/her. Nothing wrong with someone trying to educate him/herself.

If one were to exchange a large amount of btc for US dollars (say, over $20k), how would they go about that? I understand that exchanging btc right now is a terrible idea, but it just makes me curious when I see posts of people who are offloading like 100btc. Cheers!

What’s bitcoin cash? ;)

Cuz amazon's the shit. 2day shipping ftw (if you have prime that is). And, you can pay in usd if that's what you got

I'd recommend buying on amazon

Appreciate the input! I hope you know I was joking about the bitcoin Lambo.  A man can dream though, right? No, but seriously, good to know. To avoid further (sweet, sweet, blissful) ignorance, can I ask you were you found out about said market manipulation? Is it simply common knowledge within the btc community? Did you find a damning article in the press? I’d be very interested to hear your source. 
To be clear, the purpose of my questions is to try to help myself and others avoid the dog shit minefield that unfortunately makes up the dark side of the community, not to scrutinize you. Perhaps I’m playing devils advocate, but I’m certainly not trying to be a dick — hope I don’t come off that way. Once again, appreciate you helping out this newbie!

Ok cool thanks. Right now it’s proprietary to those two wallets though? Can’t say I’m a huge fan of Coinbase, although that card seems like it could be great.

From my limited knowledge, I feel that Coinbase does not have the btc community’s best interests at heart. It seems like they take a very establishmentarian approach to a very libertarian currency technology. 
One could argue Coinbase provides a very easy way into bitcoin for the inexperienced, which I would agree with. However I would very much suggest that no one hold their bitcoin in Coinbase or any other exchange due to their high potential for exploitation either for their own interests or by external nefarious entities. A hardware wallet is the best way to go for btc storage, imo.
I would also suggest buying from an exchange like GDAX (owned by Coinbase) that charges no fees or lower fees.

Thanks for the thoughtful reply! That’s exactly the plan: start with a small amount “play” money and use that to practice/determine the viability of margin trading at my skill level. If I lose it all, I’ll still be able to pay my electric bill, and will have learned valuable lessons. The alternative is a Lamborghini with in your face custom license plate.

Could you please explain the shift card? Is that a way to spend bitcoin at more places? If so, does it hook up to an exchange or can you use whichever wallet you choose? Thx

Would you mind explaining this to me or pointing me to a good article please? I’ve been ignorant to margin trading until a couple buddies started doing it. Was thinking about dabbling myself, but your comment makes me think otherwise. Thanks in advice! Happy hodling!
