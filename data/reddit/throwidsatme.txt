opening channels on a decentralized blockchain is centralized? LN is like buying a gift card you can redeem later on the network

it cant

thanks, helped me understand it a little more

Not everybody wants to run their own node. If google becomes a huge hub with a huge stake on the LN it will be good for everybody, if you don’t want to personally connect to them you don’t have to!

Only time will tell! I think it depends if google can come up with a clear revenue model.

How’d you get your bitcoin gold? My funds were in electrum at the time of the fork and I haven’t seen any actual bitcoin gold wallets yet

Yeah I was in the process of switching from electrum to trezor while the fork was happening. I was reading about something like electrum gold but as of a few weeks ago there was no supporting wallets and no replay protections

From what I understand you using trezor is the best you can do until the exchange implements segwit
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:43:04
Nah man. A paper wallet is like an offline backup, very hard to hack.
Do what the above commenter said and invest in a hardware wallet, I have a trezor and I really like it. 
Coinbase in an exchange wallet, you don’t actually own that bitcoin - you are in an agreement with coinbase that they will send you your bitcoins when you ask them to.

It shouldn’t. I actually just transacted a similar amount (a bit more) and it cost me about 15$. Which is unsustainable and ridiculous, but not 100$
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:55:01
I think there’s some pros and cons! I actually bought a trezor and had intentions of returning it to get a ledger but decided against it. At the end of the day they’re both going to work pretty well.

The wallets could communicate. It could take directly from bank account and convert to Bitcoin.
In an ideal way, there would just be a option next to the person contact, that said pay with: Apple wallet, debit card, venmo, PayPal, btc wallet.

Maybe your identity hasn’t been verified?

The one part I cringed at

@_date: 2018-02-21 05:33:52
Can’t withdraw from square cash afaik
@_date: 2018-02-21 05:35:27
Who cares. Competition is good, motives don’t matter. If they back out, another exchange will step up.
