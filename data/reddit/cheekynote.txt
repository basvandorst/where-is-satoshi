*Update* The specific issue of Paypal confusing the email - cannot be reproduced after many tests with me and friends, I believe Paypal may have just cached an old email in your Paypal box, as that hosted payment page is not actually controlled by us. I believe this is not an actual problem with my site.  When the bookings are made, the client and target/receive email addresses are validated and stored correctly in our db - they are not linked to the paypal transaction - only the booking ID is.
Thanks for your feedback , please let me know if you are able to recreate it!

Funnily enough I am using CoinBase.  I am looking into this auto-conversion feature.  At the moment I set the BTC amount manually.  Thank you very much for the heads up!

To encourage you to try it out, I will right now reduce the price from 0.5BTC to 0.25BTC for 48 hours. God speed!
