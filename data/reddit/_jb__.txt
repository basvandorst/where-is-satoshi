My brain is fried so hopefully this information is useful to someone. 
* You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture.
* Think in pairs  
* Code easily, attack early  
* Lost transaction costs almost users  
* 00212121  
* Try \+1  
* Almost open  
* Bonus clue: To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot. \(from here\)  
* \-1
I put another users image in photoshop \(whoever filtered by BIP39 words\) and ended up cropping the image down using the clues. 
* For the top portion, I cropped to just above the **infinity symbol** \(infinity and beyond\).
* For the left portion, I cropped to the left of **code**
* For the right portion, I cropped to the right of **open**.
* For the bottom, I cropped to the word **easily**
Since **code** and **easily** were separated, I figured it was mentioned to crop by. I am then assuming **attack** and **early** is a valid pair and also allows **\-\-\- words** and **/** words.
I included the word **costs** because its right before **open** \(almost open\).
I counted, and there are 12 level words, and 12 angled words. I wrote them down in excel top to bottom, left to right and got the following for each one.
**Level words**
stay   find   ability   post   sign   attack   fee   entire   costs   now   problem   proof    
**Slanted words \(like early\)**
cash   rely   pool   use   main   early   else   split   race   gap   order   define    
When put side by side in the order they appear, top to bottom, left to right, here is how they match up. Notice how **attack** and **early** are paired together.
Unfortunately this didnt work but if this helps you, feel free to donate. 13auJk6XTTuTs69zNSKLnoGFEterW55gWS
