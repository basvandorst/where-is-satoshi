In a real case, each miner will receive a different set of transactions, that's how P2P distributed system works. So the block they try to mine will be different for each of them. Hence, the softblocks will be different, too. Thus, the network will be flood with multiple softblock chains and only one of them will, eventually, win.

Well, it seems counterintuitive, but mining solo or p2pool gives you, in long term, the same (or better) yield.

What prevents miners with good connectivity to deliberately fill all their mined blocks up to 20MB? It will cost them nothing more and will punish other participants with worse connectivity.

The benefit of playing bad guy between 500k and 1MB is minimal. After the switch to 20MB blocks, a lot of them may be still about 1MB, this 20x increase of size will have large impact.
That's also why I would better start with 2MB blocks and increase them slowly, kind of how the block reward change mechanism is scheduled.

The schisma will split between three major components:

Some wallets will not support 2MB blocks, some exchanges will not accept 1MB old fork, and users will be left in a mess.
A lot of users will try to not send their old BTC, because they won't be sure on which fork their transaction will end. So ironically, the blocks may become smaller than 1MB for a long time!
Edit: well, some users will send all their BTC ASAP to nearest exchange to sell them to solid unforked fiat. Is this the goal?

As I said elsewhere, due to aggregation, a single pixel represents a lot of addresses. So, a "pixel" at [X,Y] represents number of transactions from addresses created at **time** X sent to addresses created at **time** Y. Think about a "day" or maybe few hours. Scale is not the same, as at the start of bitcoin, there were less addresses created per day.

If a single pubkey spends BTC from it to a bunch of new addresses, it generates new and new Y coordinates. But it is not the only transaction generator in the whole bitcoin world, at that moment. So the line is not vertical, but slightly sloped.
The same is for destination addresses, when someone pays to the same address (SatoshiDICE?), but meanwhile, other entities generate new addresses too. Hence, not horizontal, but slightly sloped line. 
The angle corresponds with relative amount of new addresses generated by this "cluster" compared to all new addresses generated at that moment.

The graph aggregates pubkeys, so single "pixel" represents probably thousands of BTC addresses.
Also, since transactions are M-&gt;N, it is not sure, if author counts MxN different transactions into appropriate pixel cells. 
The above mentioned fact would probably hold for a spending chain like A1 -&gt; B2 + A2 -&gt; B3 + A3 -&gt; A4 -&gt; A5 ... etc. where the whole amount of A1 is sent to B2 (just a few bits) and A2 (the rest, new large change address),  and this is repeated.

Satoshi Nakamoto was 4 people group at NSA in late 2008, who were asked by CIA to find an easy way how to safely supply money over the Internet to in-field foreign country agents. 
And like with Tor, the most insuspicious way was to start it like opensource freetime activity. Too bad it went a kinda unexpected route ..
On May 2011, Gavin actually met 3 of 4 people of the group on the Langley CIA meeting. They did not tell him, though. One of them was that guy buying few BitBills from Gavin.

- someone could inject you a different source for the blockchain page, so you would enter your passwords into hostile page (this can be mitigated using page validators)
- browsers are generally less secure than dedicated applications, one can inject something into your browser (e.g. hostile plugin or extension) and hijack your funds
- the web server can serve your password protected backup to an attacker - he can just guess your alias and then try to decrypt offline your backup

The Bitcoin-QT is just part of the initial system spinoff. 
Imagine, what if in the beginning of SMTP protocol, everyone would be required to run full SMTP server to send and receive e-mails. Later, these servers were moved to the IP domain holders and the users were able to run just e-mail clients. Nowadays, masses read e-mail on Google, Yahoo, etc. and do not use any clients at all.
The similar is with Bitcoin-QT -&gt; Electrum -&gt; Blockchain.info
In the (near) future, expect that only miners and major Bitcoin "providers" (thousands of entities) will run full nodes (with terabytes of data). Google and Apple will run their own full Bitcoin servers. Mark my words.

To get address from private key (256 random bits), you need to do ECDSA &amp; RIPEMD math gymnastic. Changing single bit in private key will change everything in the address. And you cannot go opposite way, of course.

Just by checking the screenshots, its strange that obviously the attacker DID not drain your BTC wallet completely, did he?
He left some addresses untouched and transfered just a part of the amount there. The rest was sent to ?? change address 1JeCFUe5hkoSgdCrjmPcYmZ6B5FK2Wavz which was used several hours BEFORE, probably by you. 
So if your wallet was really compromised, it must happened just several hours ago the steal.
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:41:27
You just "sign a transaction" (think cheque) "move 0.5 BTC from this address to this one", you signature attached to this. The network will propagate this transaction, validate it (they will check that there is at least 0.5 BTC on the source address), verify that the digital signature for the address is correct (so only owner of that address private key can transfer the BTC) and, finally, mine it into block .. like in stone tomb. So it will be here forever.
The change is sent to another address you own (or which is silently created for you).
Later, the vendor can use that 0.5 BTC and move it further ..

- The emphasis was on "IN MEMORY (as opposed to in database)" and strictly separated backend from the rest of network
- Even without using multicasts, still the split, at packet level, is much faster if you separately hold readonly data and modifiable channels. For example, it would allow to see depth and ticket on all those STUBBORN web pages. Lets separate traders and watchers on different sockets.

Nowhere in the world is Bitcoin being considered as MONEY, so its like you sell some commodity. Not shares, or financial derivates. If you are not a company, selling commodity is not a taxable income, at least in a lot of countries. The closest example would be to buy e.g. some pounds of tantalum and later selling it after its price soars.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:03:33
- Why isnt the backend written in C/C++ to allow fast processing of memory loaded transaction (no DB lookups)?
- Why the sockets API isn't split between readonly "broadcast" (easily multiplied on packet level) and modifiable channels (slower, but less used)?

I think your theory is realistic. You overestimate the speed of the 2009 computers - mostly Pentium III or IV, which had to run C version of SHA256 (no SSE2 code yet, I am afraid). Single CPU could get 300 kH at that time.

Did you receive a password reset notification e-mail prior to the event?
I had poor e-mail with poor password associated with MtGox and someone used that to issue password reset, captured that e-mail and tried to withdraw.
Fortunately, MtGox has 24hours withdrawal freeze upon password or e-mail change. I was luck that I tried to login during that time and I could not. With some hassle, the MtGox's support, even on Saturday, helped me to recover my access to the account.
Immediately after this lesson, I set up the 2FA and upgrade all weak passwords I use anywhere.
