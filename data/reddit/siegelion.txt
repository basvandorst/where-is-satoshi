bitcoin is going back to 7-8 k where it belongs.

The massive “premium” is caused by lira being worth a lot less that the official exchange rate.
Also it is OTC price on local bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:28:46
Like satoshi..
@_date: 2018-09-08 18:46:40
They are trading equivalent of 24000 usd in terms of official Iranian lira rate.
That rate however, does not apply to the average citizen of Iran.

Thanks yeah, i think i got it.
BIP148 itself is supported by the "economic majority" hence it means that most exchanges/wallets/processors will update. And them updating is effectively the whole bitcoin community updating.
My problem was that i didn't realize its supported by the economic majority and i thought its just some random nodes that may or may note update to BIP 148. That to me sound like a thing that would quickly cause those who updated to be split away from the main chain.
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:22:46
Usually when software updates roll out, only a percentage of users update.
When we rolled out bip148, doesn’t that make it super likely that maybe 20-30% of users updated.
That means miners basically had to start Signal SegWit just to prevent a split.
I guess this was the point? But what’s preventing some miners to not update if they notice that say, their affiliates exchange has not updated yet. Does this make it super dangerous? Since miner then has no incentive to signal.
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:08:26
Still not sure what is going on. Are they saying SW is going to cost them 100M? 
Asic boost gives roughly 15% bonus which is voided with SW. So god they are making like 700-800M just from mining a year in 2016 already? 
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:12:15
Does someone know exactly what solution it is? 
@_date: 2018-05-30 01:02:38
ok cool got it. So all of lapp has to involve payment of bitcoin of some sort (other than the one to miners) unlike eth smart contracts which can be completely random like giving birth to crypto kitties or minting baseball cards.
@_date: 2019-03-10 06:14:33
Visa MasterCard and PayPal can easily roll out bitcoin solutions. Bitcoin is against central bank, not payment solutions. Thinking bitcoin as payment is fundamentally wrong. Bitcoin is fighting against socialism.
@_date: 2019-03-26 04:20:10
Other people paid for that electricity, up to them to do whatever they want
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:30:07
If a major portion of hashpower shift to bcash right after the difficulty adjustment we are in for a storm =)
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:00:46
Don't think you can easily switch bitcoin miners into eth.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:50:44
Are you paying almost 30% fee lol it is insane
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:55:13
Banks are not bad in a sound money society. In fact, there will be many banks under bitcoin. And bankers will become a noble profession they once were.
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:20:20
Don't think you can?
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:18:28

@_date: 2017-08-22 20:36:55
They could just let ISP to shut down related LN ports/ protocols.
Like how some county bans torrent.
Not saying they will do it, just saying it is feasible. But then again, they could also just ban bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:03:07
Can a deflation currency ever work? Really curious
@_date: 2018-06-26 04:42:08
And allow 2x the transaction! Effectively a 2x without size increase!
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:50:20
Which one? BCH? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:10:58
This sounds like one of those “options”
I thought for future you are obligated to settle if you held on to the contract.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:43:37
So you saying I can buy a future but not execute it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:54:21
If BTC changes algothrim, it’s basically daed. It will have next to 0 mining power compare to before after the hard fork lol.
So there must be a difficulty adjustment implemented.
Just imagine all the shit storm that ensue
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:10:15
If I lock in a price on future, why not just buy now?
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:13:27
You are under estimating the fear.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:16:29
Buy now. Thank yourself later
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:53:39
So if price crashed or jumped, it is still massive risk no?
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:08:41
200k bitcoin is 1% of total bitcoin supply... just hodl

Why is having a future a form of insurance?
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:09:52
If I do buy a future. How does it expire? Don’t I put in money for a future?

this is  a pretty cynical article against Chinese government. Bitcoin is merely used as an attack instrument
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:28:45
And who are trading in Japan or Korea?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:13:35
We should just do proof of stake and render miners obsolete 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:49:10
The general Chinese community in my opinion is relatively conserved. I believe large portion of them even believe ETC is the more main stream version of ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:46:18
Smart contract should allow users to purchase real estate directly on blockchain: transfer of fund -&gt; transfer of title. Completely void of all these agent lawyer bullshit. Maybe a government agent as an escrow.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:19:32
That’s barely enough to pay for transaction fee XD

There are a lot people that used mm as million. Not sure why.
 Fred Wilson is one of them.

People misinterpreting pboc statements... the ban in 2013 was a warning to all national banks to ban bitcoin transaction operated under national bank. Civil transactions are still allowed.
In case you don't realize, the ban is still in effect. None of the national banks are doing crypto related transactions.
And all of the exchanges you are seeing in china are civil infrastructure not remotely related to the government.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:20:53
That's the best proof so far...
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:44:28
If you think eth is scam you are really no better than the bankers who said bitcoin is tulip..

That doesn’t mean they can’t spend 50 dollar to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-23 08:16:11
I like him. If he did cause the price to go down I’d like him to do more
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:52:26
