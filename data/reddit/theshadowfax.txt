Yes, I do, and the degree of how much it affects the market will probably depend a lot on who buys them and for what purpose. 
People who say it won't tip the scales because it's a small percentage of total bitcoin etc are fooling themselves and others out of self interest. Of course people who already have a vested interest and stake in bitcoin are going to tell others there's no panic- they want to keep their investment profitable, not see it devalue in a panic selling frenzy. It doesn't change the reality however, and public opinion is likely to play a role as we get closer to auction date because the auction represents a point at which the United States government is getting more involved in bitcoin, a currency founded on ideals of a decentralized economy without heavyhanded oversight or intervention.

Nope, sheeple are just freaking out.

If bitcoins were as convenient to buy as lottery tickets sure thing, it'd be easy to just drop some change or whatever and pick up some mbtc but as it is buying coins either costs too much or takes too long.

So, to get back at some entity you perceive as harming bitcoin, you're being a selfish dick and deliberately harming bitcoin and bitcoin users profits?
What logic.

Phew, good thing I already lost all my BTC last year.
Much sorries to you folks.

Sounds like a pretty panicked and gullible call on your part, but hey a pinky promise to yourself is like a blood oath.

Pretty much, but markets are made and broken by panicked people.

The weird part is how similar it looks to the rise it saw last year, followed by a dip, then a small rebound, then a plunge.
Personally I expect it will get worse.
