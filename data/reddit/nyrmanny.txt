The website is being updated today with several new and improved features.
The web-servers will experience downtime for approximate 1 hour and 15 - 30 minutes.
The update was initiated at approximately 12:00 PM (GMT+1)
 
The mining services will be maintained and will continue as normal.
The trading platform will be paused while the update is applied, and resumed once completed.
Ghash.io and Cex.io website will be inaccessible during this time.
 
Thank you for your patience while we work to apply the update.
