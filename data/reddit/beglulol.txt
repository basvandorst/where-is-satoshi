Haven't even got one done on blockchain ..
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:21:05
No problem buddy
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:07
Bruh nothing yet... blockchain is a joke
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:10:20
Plus they fucked everyone over 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:56
Fucking manipulators! I just found out there new scheme, I hope they get railed by it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:17:17
I'm trying to get someone to do it for me, even willing to pay 5$ just want it done already man..

you have to assume flags, not tops. This pullback is very healthy for BTC. HODL ALL DAY. Did you see the monster panic liquidation? Huge volume.

2 grand
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:35
167$ sir
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:54:29
I've been waiting forever too bro.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:34:56
You are a idiot if you store your coins on a exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:39:46
let's hope. We need it, BTC is sorta on a bad diet and is getting a little fat. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:25
Yes I understand that. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:00:36
I posted my transaction ID and someone preferred it to a miner so hopefully it's faster ... very irritating
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:46:14
What exchange/wallet ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:31:01
I agree. I'm seeing momentum staring to swing out for BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:36
Okay. I'm on a field trip right now I'll keep my eye on it... 5$ is yours, just give me a little (;
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:38:58
I'm not being mean. Just trying to inform. Don't want the lad losing money potentially
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:15:45
I use a debit card and it takes 0.0003 seconds for it to confirm.. coinbase isn't bad 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:36:22
What this guy said 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:41:21
Yes. Yes. Finally got those week hands out of here. My friend of mine sold and said it was way to risky and he was losing money. Straight FUD. Now he wants back in. Maybe they will learn to be stronger this time.
