We're tired and we want to go to bed... We had a little pump about an hour ago and it went straight to my head...

And I'm sure you're the wisest of the wise.

WRONG. You're saying that every time a coiner sells or makes a transaction using Bitcoin they're looking to profit. I sell when I NEED to. Then I reinvest. I'm not day trading. You people still don't understand that this is a currency. I use it as such. If I have to pull $500 out to purchase an item or pay a bill I'm not looking to profit. I'm looking to use my wisely invested money to make my life easier. Grow up, kids.

Just tossed another grand into the bithole... I'm a sucker for punishment. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:09:30
Really? Every troll in this subreddit seems to think HODLers lose money. I've made thousands off of Bitcoin and I'm just a novice investor. I HODL, I sell, I pay for goods and services. I keep the wheel spinning, and I'm not alone. I've never lost money. When I sell, I reinvest a little bit at a time.

Ah.. now I like you. It's all that fucking clowns fault! All I can buy in Vegas is Chinese food and whores.

Only if you step on my vagina.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:12:34
And so are your BS posts. Move on, child.
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:56:34
Am I an anomaly? Read carefully, I sold and I reinvested. I'm not a day trader. I paid bills. I purchased items as needed. Why do we have to be HODLers or day traders? Use Bitcoin as it was intended. Don't be afraid to fall in-between. I have never lost money. That's not bragging, that's just using the currency as it was intended to be used.

Now this comment I can appreciate. I'm fully for discussions that are for and against Bitcoin. My situation is mine alone. I've made substantial profits but can agree that if I would have cashed out I would have made bigger profits. I respect you and your opinions, but I feel that my profits will continue to grow, despite the current downswing. I'm just one of the few that try to invest, spend, and reinvest. I never invest more than I can afford to lose, but bitcoin has more than quadrupled my investment. I'm loving every second of the ride.
@_date: 2018-08-11 00:34:07
Only if your tiny mind thinks I invested at the end of 2017. How sad that you have so much hatred against people who have profited with Bitcoin. Fiat would have gained me NOTHING. I assume that's all you have left.

May the 4th be with us all.

I agree with you 100%. I've never been good at day trading and I respect the blokes that are!

There is no moon. Only space stations. But seriously, can we get a lift?

I sold a tiny bit  It will only go up from here. My loss is forever your gains.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:51:18
Not at all, my friend. I'm still sitting pretty. HODLING till the end. 
Just playing with fractions... and always losing my lunch money. Fecking mac and cheese if you please.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:24:20
And yo' daddy should have pulled out... HODL for now, but abort when necessary.
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:01:20
Why are you showering with a salad? No erections 'till June? Woe to the Republic.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:56:46
OR woman. Bitches be winning and losing as well. But we just look better when we're losing our collective asses. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:34:30
I could lives off of Mac and cheese... But it isn't free!  I need to make at least .98¢ today. I think I'll be going hungry.
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:41:38
Your spelling. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:21:33
Congrats! Don't listen to the trolls. We're not all rich, so feck off, trolls. One Bitcoin is an amazing accomplishment. Pat yourself on the back and wait for the dumb fecking twats to come out of the woodwork and say they own 50.
@_date: 2018-04-07 00:26:02
So cute. Try not to edit yourself so much in the future.

Right? Why can't we break free like Freddie Mercury? 
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:30:15
UPVOTE THE CRAP OUT OF THIS. I agree.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:27:02
I agree with this. I've owned many Bitcoins, but I've sold and spent many over the years as needed. BUT, I'll never let myself own less than one coin.
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:42:31
I love the smell of profit in the morning. Oh, Bitcoin, you keep me hodling on.
