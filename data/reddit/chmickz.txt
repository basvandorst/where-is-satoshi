you can use bitfinex which has a good reputation or if it's just to buy, you can use bitstamp  (but not for trading , easy overloaded server)
There is also kraken but I don't know so much about it . (I just know there exist for a while which is usually a good sign) 
Can someone post a comment about coinbase ?
Basically try some site which : 
Are well known (been arround for while), you know it's located and you know who is the CEO. 
Take real dollars as payment .

avoid poloniex .
No support and laggy platform .
Really unreliable
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:25:01
I will keep on bitching about poloniex.
If It can avoid to other my troubles , that's a good thing .
And if it makes poloniex lose customers and money , even better . That's the only way to force them to really improve service and not only posting message like "we will do something"
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:10:13
it has been like this for a while now .
The crowd is not new , neither is the verification system . So downvoting is more like giving them an agreement to screw customers . 
And maybe they should be regulated . 
PS : their verification systeme does not seems to work very well BTW

it would not be the first time for the microsoft ex boss.
He missed the internet boom, and the mobile boom.
So why not the crypto boom .

where can we see the official annoucement ? 
What's the delay between the decision and the publication ?
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:22:25
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:07:10
thanks all of you for the answer . 
@_date: 2017-03-28 14:08:07

@_date: 2017-03-31 20:19:19

I mean the full node  (bitcoind  program) doing some calculations (hashing ) to validate transactions , is this correct ?
Right now bitcoind is using the computer cpu to hash .So it's speed limit is based on the cpu. 
My question is :
would it be efficient to include in the bitcoind program , drivers for old hardware like antminer usb key, to increase the confirmation speed of a transaction ?
That could be  a way to recycle old hardware and to improve bitcoin network capability
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:02:44
interesting question 
I wonder too if i could run a node on a raspberry pi ?

I have some BTC deposit problem .
Validation is more than an hour now

@_date: 2017-03-10 16:48:52
strange thing . what time is it in the USA ?
Until what time the SEC works ? 
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:13:30
I found this :
BITSTAMP AND CACEIS TO LAUNCH CORPORATE BITCOIN INVESTMENTS
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:31:27
is it usual for the SEC to wait for the last minute, to validate an ETF ??
You can take two ways :
first no news good news .
second : we (the sec) don't like the ETF but we let you until the last minute to correct it

so what, it does not mean you have to mine BU with their hardware . Moreover  even if they succeed to change the hardware to mine only BU, if BU is worth sh... then they won't sell any hardware . Moreover most people would withdraw their money from hashnest .
Bitmain wil not win against bitcoin community . They will just die, left on the side of the road . 
All this  show is just to create fluctation on BTC price . 
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:05:37
is the same for btc china ? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:18:36
So did I .
I also received an email. Fortunately it was only a few satoshi left on my account , and after relogin, they seems to be there . 
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:18:57
What's going on ?
are people fearing  btc cash will pump value out of btc ?
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:07:28
to dump it first , you need to find a trading platform , and even worst to transfer it .
this shitcoin coin take like forever to be transfered : Example trying to transfer from a wallet to hashnest require 100 confirmations !!!! WTF .
Advice 1 : anyhow if your coins are not already on a platform you gonna have to wait .
Advice 2 . avoid to trade on hashnest . 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:12:13
This maybe just a feeling but It seems like trader are not cashing out to dollar anymore but to some other cryptos taht can be traded later on for dollars on big exchange (poloniex kraken etc...)
Coin like eth or ltc are not going down that much . LTC even seems to hold .???
Can somebody more experienced have  a look to the market ? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:16:31
hard to do with platform unresponsive like BITSTAMP !
bitstamp you suck !!
@_date: 2017-04-22 14:40:44
when i read some comments , I  realize I did  not emphasize my point. No matter if europe is not big on bitcoin . Or what politicians can really do . My point is the perceptions and  the reactions of the mass against the loss (or potential loss) of value of their savings.
I talked to the bank 2 days ago and I realized i was not the only one taking some safety actions.
@_date: 2017-04-01 12:14:48
i'm not so sure about this. I we except crypto newspapers, nobody talks about it .
Wait and see
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:32:52
not yet ;-)
@_date: 2017-04-23 18:15:24
ok 
It should be Macron VS LePen.
Probable outcome Macron . 
So no big  economic shake coming . Good
@_date: 2018-03-21 14:10:34
in the document there :

price dropping , the news is spreading fast
can't find anything here :
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:04:44
related to this :
here is the website 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:26:57
Such news shows up just at the weekend when the noobs are behind  keyboard are after a slow down slope. How convenient.
This really smells markets manipulation
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:11:05
the most interesting sentence is :
, a source close to the office told Caixin.
Meaning a bureaucrat who saw in this an opportunity to make easy money. By the way this office is not PBOC
@_date: 2017-09-09 15:40:32
1 banks are now interested in bitcoin or cryptos.
2 same for government
3 more and more investors are coming in .
And curiously at the same time china and russia would like to ban bitcoin. 
Moreover russia is trying to invest in mining farm.
Finally the news come from one source with no backup . And occur during the weekend when it can not be verified  and after everybody could notice  a slow but regular sell of bitcoins on main exchanges 
It's just my opinion but this smells like manipulation . 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:15:01
you have news coming from one source only , just before the weekend when the noobs are in front of the keyboard, and just after a slow slope down (meaning someone trying to sell big amount discretly to have some cash reserve ) and you wonder if the news is real ???????
Seriously...wake up boys .. this is pure market manipulation
@_date: 2017-09-20 11:02:25
be careful because among the new  subscribers , there are some profile just created to spread fud or spam

strange , does not work from france .
On the top right of the page there is a english link . Do you get something if you click ?
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:37:36
i have a white page.
do you see something ins the english news version ?
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:06:48
that's the strange thing , usually i have access to it
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:34:46
could you send a link to the article please , instead of a link to a screenshot ?
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:47:46
nice try, but fake news.
Badly done the link to google . A search using reuters keyword easely brake your trick
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:23:22
they are quoting each others or quoting "anonymous source"
meaning they know dick . but they publish article to have some click
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:12:14
I'm use he opportunity of this thread ,  cause I red somewhere than bch was mainly suported by bitmain.
Could we say than bch is a chinese bitcoin ??
@_date: 2017-09-11 20:44:10
I wonder . 
How long does it take to pboc to publish confirmations or deny on their website 
The ICO news was publish on the 8 th of september . 
If the ban was true . would it not be published by now  ?
By the was I tried to do some search on baidu but with no luck. Can somebody who speaks chinese try that ? 
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:46:12


or meaning "we have no source but we made an article to clickbait
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:55:10
no, there s no "s" in his name 
@_date: 2017-07-30 15:37:18
all this remind me the DAO and the split eth etc.
If you're a gambler and you can afford to wait . don't sell you bcc and keep some cash to buy btc after the fork.
Just my opinion , at the en choice is yours to make.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:53:55
exactly. LePen said bitcoin was created by banker . Of course even she knows as much about bitcoin as a tee leaf about india ,  she understood that it would give the opportunity for the people to protect their savings , and screwed her plan to go back to the old french money . 
Bt most of the french still have  brain . and she clearly lost the last elections . 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:06:11
or another trading platform got hacked . And the thief are selling
