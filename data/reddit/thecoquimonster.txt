I haven't found any exchange that actually uses L-BTC yet. Adam mentions "The Rock Trading" but I didn't see any pairings or L-BTC reference on their site.

Is there going to be any rebuttal to the podcast with Peter Rizun? Looking for a decent summary + counterpoints.

What is the point of trading a side-chain?

We need a bear market for at least another year so that Lightning is ready to handle the onboarding of any future bubbles.
I'm looking forward to exchanges/ATMs/coinbase (fuck coinbase) selling BTC already on the lightning network.
In addition to providing instant usability for essentially free transactions, I imagine buying BTC already on the lightning network will also be phenomenal from a privacy standpoint.

There is a shill campaign going on for Grin. Don't buy Grin now. You aren't missing out on anything. The inflation is insane and if you want to invest, it will be at a significantly lower in the near future.

How can I send this guy some satoshis on LN?

The least you could do is provide a link.

I plan to do the same. If there's even a chance of being brought back, how do you not take it. Plus, imagine what a BTC will be worth in a hundred years.

Bugs a month out is absurd. The timeline is irresponsible. Moving forward is negligent.

There's definitely a chance of that happening, just like there's a chance of anything happening.
There are futures that speculate on the price of both future coins and right now, S2X is not nearly as valuable and the current BTC.
Watch those price movements closely as it's, currently, the only way the market has of gauging the future price.

Check out 
Thats the Winklevoss exchange. They are regulated so don't expect much privacy but I believe they are fully operational in New York.
I've had great experiences buying and selling with them. Bank transfers are pretty damn fast too. You'll also pay much lower fees than coinbase.

No. The time to do this was months ago. There will be a big crash eventually but we have no idea how high it will go before then.

It is a poor article or well written?

They will say the same thing when it's under $3k, $2k, $1k, $0. 
Not that $0 will happen. 
I'm just trying to say that these people are talking their books and we should ignore them because they will say the same thing at any price.
