A cashless society, total control, sounds extreme. But extreme is expected. Hopefully we're not headed that way.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:51:16
You may be best of asking around on a Litecoin subreddit. :)  
Also - do not bother trading on Reddit for BTC. People on here will accept PayPal, however you have no protection if you get scammed.   
No way to get your money back at all. Be careful! :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:16:55
No ones being nasty, they're being blunt. You're asking a question which shows you don't know what you're doing, we can't help you.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:41:38
5 dollars is a very small amount, it will take a lot longer than 16 hours.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:41:21
At the moment, the fees are way higher than £5 so you won't be able to buy. Also, you commented on the post from earlier about underage trading so unfortunately you won't be able to use exchanges. :(  
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:28:58
Nope. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:55:40
Satoshi's BTC wallet holds allegedly around a million, yes.  
Currently valued at around 14.5 billion dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:16:18
You'll just have to wait. It'll probably come back into your wallet soon anyway.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:24:15
Back then it was a relatively new thing. People who did know about it &amp; held Bitcoin most likely didn't expect it to get to where it is today - therefore, don't regret that you didn't buy any back then, no one knew it would grow to what it is now. :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:49:43
Nah. Even with bitcoin hitting 1 mil it won't be any more than a couple cents 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:43:44
I hope I don't keep seeing this on new every 30 minutes.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:51:18
Not desperate, I'd say uninformed. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:16:16
I mean if it's only a euro.. don't bother
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:25:32
Hey, it's me, Jimmy.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:25:24
Not worth the click sorry, it's all common knowledge here. $20,000 isn't much especially if you don't have a job other than trading Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:45:00
Oh. I get you. It's probably to establish you as a payee in the system so that you can withdraw. Idk. There probably isn't a way around it - you'll have to use a different bank
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:45:24
I just checked..?
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:11:26
This post screams jealousy.   
Sure, nothing is impressive, but don't be a cunt. He rode the BTC wave, and everyone else here is too.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:17:15
That's exactly what someone would've said about some other  
possibility, exactly when BTC was small.  
Stuff like this happens all the time. Don't fret about it.  
If you're depressed, and genuinely, you should seek help.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:13:12
Before analysing his typing, you should see that his older comments on Reddit use the same style of typing. I've noticed people who don't use English as their mother tongue tend to use that style of typing, so I doubt it's because he's pissed. :p
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:47:44
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:38:57
I don't understand how it works completely.  
So, to purchase with BTC, the buyer has to contact the seller via e-mail or Etsy I assume. And then they make the payment, but what stops the seller from simply removing the item from their page, and saying that it was never sold? Are they still charged the fee if they mark the item as not sold?
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:14:04
Doubt that it's orchestrated like that - that'd just be creating a problem for themselves. But they'll kill the problem before it becomes a threat. At this moment in time, I doubt it is considered a threat, but if it continues the way it does, it will be.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:30:19
Governments will do everything within their power to stop Bitcoin from controlling their economies. They will. And if it comes to it, they will crush it. Otherwise there is no purpose of government, if taxes aren't paid etc
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:44:15
I think there may be some ways, not directly with the visa gift card though.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:04:36
Like your mothers titties.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:25:43
Probably not a good place to ask about this.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:23:22
You're being a nutter. Sure, they're corrupt, but a post like this will get easily dismissed. I believe the dude, but he's just being a little too desperate and needs to wait for an update. Just chill mate, wait until he sorts his shit out. I bet you he'll get the money soon anyway, 16 fecking hours. lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:58:36
I'm not saying anything about a bubble.  
I'm just saying that not everyone, and definitely not the majority of people are new to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:48:53
The only reason why people say this is because illegal markets flourished via the Deep Web &amp; because of Bitcoin.  
Allowed a way to pay for illegal items without risk of the law catching up. Once more and more businesses and services start accepting Bitcoin, the argument will fade away.
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:53:51
No, not at all.  
Not all of Bitcoin interest is a fad.  
People overestimate the amount of people who are just following the trend.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:21:54
I'm confused - are you looking to buy BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:23:39
I'll save you a click. He makes around $300 a month, apparently.   
Those iPhone X's are worth $1000.  
Just another shitty concept for a clickbait video.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:05:57
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:33:55
I agree that he's a mewling shit, but fucking hell you're being way too aggressive.  
I'll settle that someone probably pissed in yer fucking weetabix you cunt.
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:30:48
Bitcoin isn't the answer to a good life buddy :) 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:45:54
No idea. But we're talking about a bunch of powerful people here - they'll figure out a way. They have to, otherwise everything they've built will be wiped out, because of Bitcoin. That'd make for a great twist in the story of the modern age.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:58:00
Of course it is. Kill the problem before it becomes an threat.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:20:58
Because those people have the space to spend.  
If no one uses it, it won't become a global currency.  
No one works to buying/trading BTC and then drops all of it on a Lambo. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:00:36
What will be worth trillions, one Bitcoin? Lmao yeah, when the dollar gets inflated to fuck. And I mean fuck. Not even post WW1 germany inflation.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:17:56
If you're looking to get money urgently you could always deal with someone willing to take small amounts for online services like Skrill, PayPal?
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:06:42
The first one didn't make sense, I'm having trouble with this one too.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:13:39
Why do you question everything?   
Well simplified - 
What is meant is that by mining with a regular powered, non-optimised for mining system, you will be making something (yes, pennies) - however the cost of mining (electricity) will outweigh your profits.   
It is not worth it mining with a regular computer. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:10:19
Ah. I was going to send you 2 BTC. But it seems you mind that.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:53:06
You'd have to ask around for reccomendations.   
And I assume you mean debit card. I'm not sure about the terms with a debit card so perhaps you should take the safe route and use your parents. But if you're required to connect a bank account, then it's fine.
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:08:38
Not worth it at the moment with the fees.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:31:07
I believe you will still have to use the same name on the bank account when you add the bank account to your Coinbase account.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:17:43
Sigh. You see the /s right there?
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:06:08
Trading is not allowed on this subreddit.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:29:50
Chill dude.  
What was the point of your comment? I didn't come here to shit on him.  
I assumed something, was wrong, and OP helped clarify it, in a respectful conversation. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:14:41
Maybe I'm a little too drunk for this. :(
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:21:28
LocalBitcoins is cool.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:55:51
LocalBitcoins is probably ideal. Although, I'd rather HODL ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:12:09
I'm not OP. Just playing with you.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:30:42
Will do. While I'm at that you should stop being a cunt.  
He's clearly an impatient whiny shit who needs to wait for his money to actually arrive. This is a normal trade, always happens, he probably has underlying problems that he needs to get checked.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:23:35
Well then Etsy isn't accepting Bitcoin.. are they.  
That's a P2P transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:31:34
If you're looking to buy Bitcoin, there is always private sellers you could contact. Someone who'd be willing to buy it for you. Of course, you'd have to find someone kind enough to do that for you.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:40:03
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:00:34
Games like that don't last that long anyway. Games are a totally different thing, wtf.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:40:58
LocalBitcoins or an exchange are good places to buy. Or private sellers.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:31:31
I've already explained what he has to do and that's **wait**.  
No one cares what you think about it - OP do us a favour and delete the post. It's not helping your cause.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:29:45
You mean your fork explainer video?
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:48:21
If we were in 2012 I would've tipped you a bitcoin for that comment. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:10:25
eBay won't die. There will always be a market for it. As long as fiat exists, cryptocurrency based purchases won't be the normal. Not everyone will adopt crypto
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:34:39
Don't you think that they may prefer the fiat system? Keep people in debt. People don't know they're being controlled this way, atleast this way society believes it has some control. However, a cashless society, knowing that their accounts can be frozen when they step out of line would eventually revolt.
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:24:34
That one went straight over you. 'For all we know'
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:07:10
Most likely remotely, unless you have no security whatsoever on your local device.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:26:21
Decentralized currency can grow to a larger market cap than any national fiat.
The dollar is the "world's reserve currency" but through most of the world you cannot and will not ever be able to spend it.
A decentralized currency is the first truly international money since gold. As a result it could potentially become larger than national currencies. The larger the market cap, the more potent the currency.  
TL:DR - No one makes rules.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:10:04
Just don't bother.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:36:58
So just a novelty item?
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:33:19
I'm not a user of Etsy, but I assume like eBay they make their money by taking fees from the transaction. If people start using BTC as a way to transact, they're not making money. I suppose they don't notice it as a problem to their profits yet. When they see it as a problem, they'll stop it being accepted, adding it to their policy.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:45:40
Oh, I get it now. I assumed Etsy operated like eBay.  
That's awesome. Thanks for the TIL :)
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:51:42
What about it? You won't find any sites that sell BTC for PP that are trustworthy. I also wouldn't trade on Reddit if anyone offers it to you. You do not have buyer protection.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:14:06
Apart from GDAX supporting you I doubt there's a way around it. Perhaps someone has been using your ID elsewhere?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:34:42
@_date: 2018-01-02 13:14:18
Hmm. I'm sure this is breaking a rule.  
 'Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed'

It didn't.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:03:16
Could've already happened. It's inevitable. If not now, it will happen within the decade, even if we do not know about it. I don't think it'll get taken over to an extent, but controlled so that it isn't a threat.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:57:54
No thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:01:51
Probably not.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:14:43
I'm sure you could do that. They can't get any information from your bank account like that, but you'll have to add the real name on the bank account. Other than that, they won't be able to see anything else about the bankholder.   
Apart from that, I'd reccomend not using Coinbase anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:53:10
What I'd do is get rid of that draft on your second account, make a physical copy of your passwords and store that somewhere safe. Change your passwords completely, and by that I mean don't just add a ABC or 456 on the end of it. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:44:05
There's always been fees on sending Bitcoin, however at the moment they're astronomically high - not worth it to buy miniature amounts basically. For an exchange, you'd need more than a debit card. ID too. I'd say the age limits are there for a reason, but nothing is wrong with holding a little in a wallet. :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:26:03
He's verified via ID, passport and all. You could get him in trouble, but instead you're whining. Work it out with him. If you can't, work it out with localbitcoins. Atleast fucking attempt to get your money back before crying.  
**he's not even located in England** so there's a real high chance of your money being held in the system because of his bank. You'll get it. Be a little patient.   
**offshore account** PAYMENTS CAN BE HELD AND THEY TAKE TIME. You're being way too impatient. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:23:34
A little violent.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:24:55
Wow, that's interesting. Will give it a read. Although I doubt they saw it becoming what it is today back then.
