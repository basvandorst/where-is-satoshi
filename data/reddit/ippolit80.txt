People define terms in different ways. Some define capitalism as being a system where the people who control the most money rule over everyone else, others define it as being the domination of materialist motives, and others define it as any system that respects economic freedom (and the term "economic freedom", of course, is itself ambiguous - for example, I've seen people refer to copyrights and patents as being a vital component of economic freedom and as unconscionable violations of it). It's best to be careful when throwing around political terms when you have the kind of ideological diversity you see in the Bitcoin community.
