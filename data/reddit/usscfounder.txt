They found tens of thousands of men, women, and children holding hands buried at these sites like they were killed instantly. They even found in one of the temples buried engraving carved begging their gods to help them and to stop... [ a description of something that they have tried to described that can best be summarized as a nuclear blast] by an army that was going from city to city destroying everything and everyone. Look it up. I am not making this up.

Here is the design Specs for a New Client-Server Application that utilizes the Bitcoin/Litecoin application and protocol. Makes transactions untraceable, stops double spend attacks, and is as fast as Visa, MasterCard and Paypal.

Believe me, I am tempted to do so. God knows I have more than enough of the skills necessary to do so. But, this needs to be a community effort with everyone collaborating together. look at all of the ridiculous alt coins coming out everyday. This has got to stop. The application can be written in php only on a LAMP server using bittorrent, bitcoin, and TOR. It not that difficult. The important thing is that people understand HOW the cryptocurrency software and protocols are supposed to work. I have posted design specs here:

How about nuclear physicist confirmed reports of nuclear bomb sites found in India more than 9000 years old? 
How about similar sites found all over the planet.

Some people's world would fall apart if they found out aliens existed. So they label people crazy who do believe just to make themselves feel better. So sad.
But there is overwhelming evidence that we came and colonized this planet long ago. The only aliens that exist are just more of us [man] on other planets. Man has been travelling the stars for a log long time.

All of the code for bittorrent, bitcoin and tor onion router ARE ALL OPEN SOURCE. Any idiot with half-assed skills can modify the above code! Just look at all of the alt-coins coming out everyday. Systems design is just as important as the code that runs it. If you read the post you will see that I have submitted some of the designs and some spec for the coding as well. 
The system I designed Is FOR ALL CRYPTOCURRENCIES NOT JUST LITECOIN. to ronau: If you knew how to read you would have seen that.

Uh, It is widely known. I don't know where you have been, man.

If you had bothered to read the bitcointalk post in it's entirety you would have seen that its about software design. Most of the code is already written. The whole point was to show how cryptocurrency is SUPPOSED to work. It was a continuation of a thread about new altcoins coming out everyday and the direction of the development of cryptocurrency. This thread here:
Further, I have stated in the post that I would design the software but would not code it. Coding the software is easy and simple, as I stated before most of the code is already written (as I stated in the original post).
The post was about the design of cryptocurrency. Bitcoin and other altcoin are best suited to operate as lower level application and should not be designed for direct end-user control or use. Like web browsers use tcp/ip for lower level operations, the Bitcoin application and protocol should operate the same way. End-user applications and services need to be built on top of the Bitcoin protocol and application. My entry show how a properly designed system is supposed to look and work. I will post design specs in the bitcointalk entry for anyone (including yourself) to code if interested.

Title is misleading.  Cointap will only allow you to buy bitcoins with thier cards. Not buy products or goods or services via bitcoin.  It is just another bitinstant. One that uses convienience stores instead of money gram. They have no future because the powers that be will shut them down. just like they shut down bitinstant.
I wish Gyft.com would sign walmart.  That would be great!
