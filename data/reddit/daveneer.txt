Are people seriously discussing Satoshi like he's still around and is an existential threat to bitcoin?  
Pick better talking points if you are going to shill.

CNBC is having some fun shaping the narrative. There's no way they didn't know what they were doing putting him on.

There are some updates on their twitter guys.

This is absolutely terrible guys.  The one thing I noticed both of you had in common was the Comcast.net email domain that the hackers likely gained access to.  Are the hackers exploiting something that requires access to your original email? 
It seems that to use Coinbase safely there is a need for 2fa on both the email and account.

They'll need to address the issue in more depth. The twitter post was flaky and made me doubt the safety of the application.

I am so glad they made this move. It should provide more protection from users that are less security inclined and ease of mind for those that are.

Amazing.  If you are going to hate Apple, at least make sure your facts are accurate.  
For example, it has been shown that Apple has among the best expectations for labor involving their products.  In fact, they conduct [audits](  
I do not know why I bothered replying but please keep an open mind regarding these companies that you have decided to hate indiscriminately.  
Since you love Bitcoin, the very least you can do is appreciate a company that played a significant role in technology as we know it today.

You are not the only one. 
I believe, in due time, bitcoin will become a considerable asset.  However, there will be bumps along the way.  
I invested because this will probably the only time in my life where circumstances allow me to take this sort of risk.  I do not want to lose out on the potential gains because I fear a manageable loss.

Damn it man. I know you're worried and stressed about bitcoin's current state. 
Take a step back and breathe. It'll be alright. No matter what happens I want you try to reevaluate things in a positive manner. 
I've been viewing your posts for a while now and am just growing concerned.  Your growing cynicism and anger makes me sad :(

Thanks.  I was wondering why no one discussed their experience with the vault.

I guess I need to begin moving my coins to a hardware wallet.  Regardless of whether your assessment is true or not, I am doing a very stupid thing keeping my coins with them.
Thanks for the final push.
Don't get me wrong, I do trust Coinbase.   They've done a lot for Bitcoin and I wouldn't have gotten involved if not for them.  I'll continue getting my bitcoin from there.

A more cynical take on this post would be that it's attempting to shake some people out of crypto.

Hasn't Bill Gates distanced himself from the tech industry?  He's pursuing some other ideals in industries that likely do not involve Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.
Sounds like he's regurgitating what his new circles are saying.  He's behind the times now.  It's best not to comment negatively on something unless you have an actual understanding of it.

Same problem here.  I shot them an email regarding the issue.
I haven't received a response email yet but I'm glad I'm not the only one.  Scared the hell out of me.
@_date: 2016-05-23 00:34:54
I had the same issue and it seems that Coinbase is working on it.

Change your damn email on the site and make sure you have 2FA on.
