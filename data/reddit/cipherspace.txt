An Australian dolphin once told me to watch out for Russian whales bro... and bullshit on Reddit.
@_date: 2018-10-23 03:05:51
Hey lil critter! Been a while bro. Not trash talking anyone today? Slow day ya?
@_date: 2018-10-22 03:32:09
Welcome bro! High risk? Hell ya. Worth it? Fawk ya!!
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:27:12
Me too bro. Might take a few years to see big upswings, might be a few months. What matters is it’s UP!
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:54:18
So now that the storm is almost past, even Roubini been shot down in Senate with his scaling and bashing discredited by the far more knowledgeable Valkenburgh - are we headed for a November to remember? We on a clear path with no growing pains for a while ya?
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:20:44
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:56:45
And you’re here on this sub to enlighten us all from the good of your ticker yah? Or you like spreading scare stories? Bro if you feel this way why you not running for the hills with whatever you could get for your bags? 
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:27:29
Trolls speak when the price suits their goals bro. They jump out and talk shit about doom for BTC, then they disappear when the price is headed up ya? People like yourself post whether the price is up or down and you stay your ground. You get the respect bro, the trolls are like rats that hang around when you leave the garbage out. Screw em.
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:05:52
Aight I can’t say you’re wrong there bro
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:55:18
Bcash that’s rich bro. You dedicated your user name to a shit coin. Bcash already bested you bro.
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:28:52
You’re such a shallow bitcoin fanboy you should do it bro.
@_date: 2018-10-08 16:34:34
Tough man in front your keyboard in mommy’s basement. You mad bro?
Looking like you the one jumpin on my post talking shit pretending you a tough guy when I wasn’t even talkin to you. So you should take your half bitcoin and fuck off bro.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:29:10
That BS happens in all markets, just easier to pull off in the toddler days of crypto. Growing pains baby. What's cool as a jazz cat is that half the comments on that article are defending crypto and raising legit points. I never used to see that back in the day ... progress! Loads of sweet progress. Balee dat!!!
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:05:00
You mean like it did the last 5-10 years bro?
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:39:01
Yo it’s coming bro. Ya can post pictures of a big hairy ass man all over but the baby can only grow so fast!
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:17:46
He was firing back bro, can ya blame him? You called him in a post by name bro.
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:37:38
Yah I put a bandaid on that flesh wound bro and all back to normal in my camp yah.
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:40:40
I'm BACK babies!! (or should I say bakkt he he) It's Q4, and I return to bitcoin right on shedule just like I did past few years.
So... it's been a good few years now. What am I seeing? After 10 years, this IS the most exciting time for bitcoin. From nothing to over $6000 - das some impressive moving. There was even a few big spikes along the way and one of em almost $20k!! That'll tell you what kind of price this thing can hit when it's not even finished finding its legs. If we're too stupid to ignore signs like that then we deserve to miss out is what I'm sayin here.
Look at what's happened with the price over these years with nothing going on. I'm so f stoked to see what's gonna hapen in the next few years now that there's real shit happening!!
Ya'll ready for another November to remember? A 2019 that rocks the foundations? Don't let the calm before the storm fool ya people. This is how bitcoin price moves .. the calmer and quieter it gets, the bigger the storm that follows.
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:23:37
No bro. I was saying he was a buzz kill and he can give as good as he gets cause he’s grown up. Unlike you with your little fits. Did you hurt yourself freaking out spitting all over the room and spewing your insanity at me ya?
Your mom must be proud ya? Keep livin the dream fanboy. Everyone gotta have somethin ya? This is your thing lil critter. Pissin off the randoms in Reddit. You must be proud lil man now. Live that dream boy, get more pissed lil little baby come on you can make mama proud ya?
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:22:03
Mainstream people? Ha ha ha ha ... you think that was mainstream dumbass? You ain’t seen nothing yet bro.
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:27:49
Apologies y’all. Sites posted retraction saying this was not accurate. I fell for it and no problem owning that. Saw it on a few different sources... thought it was truth. Owning up.

Dude I got you pegged, s'always a few of you kickin around in the shit anytime the price is beat up. World be oppressed as fuc if you were contagious. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:42:33
Dude where da fuc do you guys come from? See God got to love stupid people too, cause look how many of y'all he went and made yah? No bitcoin whale wizards sittin around a table timing sells and no tether conspiracies either. All that shit no more than scare stories made to fuel up click-bait articles, what..you think you hoo hahs are the only ones that could solve the tether case? Daaayam. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 15:07:42
So what’s your point bro? I talk fucked up ya? OK got it. You got something to say about Bitcoin since this is a bitcoin sub? Or your life that empty you make posts to say nothing ya?
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:36:56
Everyone on this Reddit sub knows you’re not mentally stable and that you the one that bashes everyone bro. So go ahead little critter and talk your shit like you always do, cause I’m here to talk Bitcoin. You realize you write whole posts to just make yourself feel better by trashing other peeps ya? You don’t even mention bitcoin. 
Live your dream sick boy.
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:19:57
Great input, thanks! I definitely agree that on an institutional level they don't want to be late to the party but also aren't poppin to be the first one to eat either right? Appreciate your words man!
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:37:29
DAFUC? Tether? You ain't one of them tether conspiracy bitches say it ain't so. I thought you all got endangered by the reality plague or some shit?  
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:34:57
Cool story bro. If that was a crypto fiction learn to read volume 1 for preschool. So what about all the that time USDT was worth more than USD ... by MORE margin than it is down from USD now yah? Same thing was happening with price difference from Coinbase to Binance then too so your homemade fake tether story ain’t holding water bro.
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:19:55
You sound like a real buzz kill bro. Your name shows up on the “do not invite list” a lot ya? 
@_date: 2018-10-02 10:35:58
Wow, you’re just a spiteful hateful little shit. All you’re doing here is making reddit look bad. You’re telling me you’re like a 5 year old that hates a lot of people for no reason? I DON’T CARE. 
Go bother one of them, and get the hell off my post.
@_date: 2018-10-29 14:48:16
Hey bro, seems like only time you post is to talk down to those who invested in crypto ya? People buy in too high sometimes yeah but they also made some great buy in's previous to last year's big run up. Crypto has longer bear markets than a lot of stocks but the bull markets make it worth while. Anyone bought at 15k and held can keep holding and still make out just fine. One thing is certain - they don't need cocky told you so's from cheap seats.
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:56:34
Yes this ^
@_date: 2018-10-17 03:59:02
Bro your capacity for bullshit got no boundaries ya?

Probably think he’s smarter than Elon Musk. Hey bro we all entitled to fantasies ya? 
@_date: 2018-10-24 03:23:23
Sorry bro, it’s my fault too. But he’s soooo easy to upset ya? Big hate in that guy bro.
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:12:33
Herd is always quiet after a nice sideways lullaby bro, then they appear like a haze off on the horizon ... and then everyone sees them coming. Oh bro you don't even know ..they start scramblin to buy but it's already too late cause they can't catch it in time. The fomo grows and the herd fattens and then some fool says 'gawd dammmmit!!! I shoulda bought more of that shit when it was 6k!!'  
yeah bro so what I'm sayin is you never hear them until it's too late yah. Buy the shit when it's not a race against a rising price. But no. Everyone wants to wait until it's fomo in time. World is messed bro.
@_date: 2018-10-23 03:04:07
@_date: 2018-10-08 06:18:08
BTC ain’t crossing 7k for you to make a quick buck bro. It’ll cross it cause of the sharding and the layers and the side chains. They soupin up the chain baby. You think it’s dying cause the price ain’t popping fast enough then sell your shit to me baby.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:52:22
You got a grip on things? You need a grip on life bro. You sound like sick little perve with issues or some shit. Like either buy crypto or gtfo bro, nobody cares what you think or your trash talk about other users like that man.
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:10:09
First of all please don’t include me in your twisted perverted fantasies boy. Who even thinks that way? 
Second I ain’t old but even if I was why dafuc do you think old is an insult? Getting old is called being lucky son, and if you saw some of the shit I seen you’d understand that there’s only 2 options - get old because the other option blows. Old people are wiser and I respect them. You’d be wise to try the same boy.
@_date: 2018-10-01 19:31:08
?? Wha? You drunk buddy? Who let this guy in here, we not picky about who gets in or what? Have another drink and leave me alone man.
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:39:45
Yah so I been kickin around the bitcoin ball for a long time, and I’m gettin the sense that any opportunity to buy bitcoin below 7k is closing fast. It’s all cool if you wanna call me on it but I can hear the distant rumble of the herd getting closer and when they come there ain’t no going back to 6k coins y’all.
@_date: 2018-10-22 20:10:50
Dayam bro. Some people feed trolls. But you educate em ya? You a better man than me. Nice summary though, I do agree with this.
@_date: 2018-10-08 19:58:04
Yeah bro that’s cause that’s what peeps say when big things are ahead Sherlock.
@_date: 2018-10-09 15:06:17
He wasn’t negative he was being a dumb shit disturber on purpose bro. You calling me a rabid dog is getting personal with your shit so you don’t see why you a hypocrite fool?
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:30:40
Yeah...in the green not rich lol, but not from this year’s investments bro. If I only counted this year I bought up until May and again this past month but I managed to do OK in the last couple of run ups and I’m fairly confident this next one is gonna put the last two to shame ya?
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:56:55
Nobody’s seen it this flat is a while. That’s pretty much the best signal for a new climb there is bro. You sound like an anti bitcoin soldier, looks like you’re in for a disappointment soon ya?
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:59:00
Yo whatchoo mean bro? I got a way?
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:02:59
Bro, he's only learning the concept of a decimal - don't rush him into the complications of zoom, you'll break him.
@_date: 2018-10-03 16:23:27
If anyone could answer questions like that they’d be busy enjoying their millions yah? Me thinks 20k is a point that bitcoin will easily reach and pass but the time frame gotta be real hey.
@_date: 2018-10-08 16:46:18
Couple days ago you were talkin shit about some fat nurse sounded like you a twisted little retard but I didn’t say shit. Minded my own businesses. So why couldn’t you do the same instead of Bustin in on my comments not meant to you? Then we wouldn’t be havin this trash talk convo an you wouldn’t have to call me names like a preschool neckbeard
@_date: 2018-10-02 15:35:35
Hey lil critter! Don't rush progress. Good things come to the peeps that wait it out. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:16:58
He bro I’ll buy them from you directly and save you fees ya? If you’re not full of shit and pretending you got shit you don’t have that is. So what is it bro? You a nocoiner full of shit?
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:30:51
Your ego that big ya? You think you’re qualified to inform me bro? I’ll sit you down and school you quick. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:15:31
Yah seen you throw your ignorant ass into my posts a few times now. Tell ya what, long as it’s only me you insulting and not going all dr doom on bitcoin I’m cool with that. Insult me all ya want bro if that makes you feel more like a man. I got thick skin. I’m here to talk bitcoin not trash.
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:17:57
That’s not a plummet son that’s just a lil scratch 
@_date: 2018-10-02 00:28:29
Daaayyamm you a nasty little critter aren’t ya boy?! Well hey buy BTC, don’t buy BTC. Do whatever floats your boat son. I’m just expressing my take on bitcoin that’s what this sub is for. Go be a nasty little prick to someone who wants to fight with you, I’m not looking for that shit son.
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:34:42
Dafuc we callin news these days? Media is a joke bros. Bitcoin goes up and ya don’t hear a big lot right. Drops $300 and all these shit news stories talking bout how bitcoin is dead and the end is near what whatever dafuc else they figure gonna get em pricks for clicks. Ridin this shit out and grabin the dip yah.
@_date: 2018-10-31 17:39:31
Yes I know that...and I never said I was in Canada. It is even in small text above the comments section but the point is that the comments didn't even read as rude or too long or any profanity etc. One comment I read there referenced that Peter Thiel said Bitcoin could be the currency that he had hoped PayPal would have been. It got removed too. That's some bullshit bro.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:59:12
Depends how many BTC you buying and selling bro. If it’s only one bitcoin then that 300 bones in 2 weeks ain’t something to brag about ya?
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:20:39
Lol. You’re bringing down the average Reddit IQ. But you go on bro, pretend you’re half smart - that’ll help you cope with being a piece of shit.
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:59:01
Yeah so all those reports last week about fools getting burned by announcing their crypto holdings...missed that ya?
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:20:19
To be fair the dude did say in 10-15 years and a big lot of change can come about in that time. Didn't mean to jump in on your convo here boys, just saying :)
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:18:50
More subs dividing the participants
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:54:39
Hey Bitcoin community! A lot of people are feeling that bakkt will be the catalyst that really kicks off institutional involvement, and I agree with this somewhat. I'm definitely feelin the love for bakkt!
There's are also many smart people I speak with that believe institutional investment is already well underway, because OTC trading accounts for twice... that's right my homies...TWICE.. the daily volume of exchange trading.
Any thoughts or insightful contribution to this y'all?
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:35:24
Well now she knows less than before ya? And you don’t see the irony in what you just said to your other crap posts? 
So that ain’t mainstream bro. That’s part of the precursor to a bitcoin shitstorm that’s coming and you ain’t intellectually prepared for it.
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:53:37
Don't feel bad about that bro! I used to think monkeys could understand basic concepts until you started posting in here. So there ya have it - we all guilty of getting caught up in stereotypes ya?
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:03:49
Lonely people. Dude’s in a bitcoin sub but he hates bitcoin. What-ya think?
@_date: 2018-10-11 21:32:32
Bitcoin does have its share of challenges but Roubini is not one of them.
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:14:26
Bro you completely ignoring what OP dude said in second half. All that positive going ons. It’s all happening or gonna happen in next few months bro. You gotta turnoff your filter and look at the clean side of the rocks yah?
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:54:51
Yo, you all buying the wrong kind of ether 
@_date: 2018-10-22 17:07:53
Only thing this failed troll spreads is awareness of his ignorance ya? I'm good with that bro cause soon pretty much anyone on here will have him labeled as bottom of the barrel and we can get back to useful discussion.  
@_date: 2018-10-31 15:02:24
So Canadian news site CBC posts an article about how Bitcoin will reverse efforts to fight climate change right? I posted a comment explaining how many miners are exploring ways to use cleaner energy and even recycling heat energy. They removed the comment ... along with every other comment I saw there that supported Bitcoin from other users. That's freedom of speech ya?
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:37:06
Trying to predict bitcoin action using TA is like trying to predict traffic in a new city where the roads are constantly under construction and new Roads, businesses and subdivisions are popping all the time yah?
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:10:29
You're already repeating same shit all the trolls said last bear market bro. Think bottom feeders would be more original after all the years but same ol crap ya? Since they were all wrong I'm gonna just call you wrong and save everyone some time. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:33:21
Yo that’s same as calling the internet a joke cause you lost money invested into dot com companies in the 90s bro.
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:45:13
Trump was a pump an dump of a whole other genre baby, and I don't go political on this shit. Just lay down on being the joke of crypto with your tether spook stores this shit been laid to rest. keep up boy.
@_date: 2018-10-23 16:54:15
Top 5 list? Lol you really are twisted ya? You keep Livin that dream bro. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 19:29:43
It’s really hard to say BitChick (love the name)!
There’s still a lot of speculation in run ups, but at least now there’s serious network value and real investment products are being proposed by seriously legit companies, so real value is materializing fast for the good ol bitcoin!
40k is not unrealistic at all but can’t say when.
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:22:20
If you tried to say somethin half acceptable you expecting a drop or some shit, maybe some fool would take you serious. But damn yo you soundin like a man with a perception problem. Either that or you just aim for the lowest possible shit show scenario you can to sound like the most bearish bitcoin guy out there. Remember bro if the world didn't suck sometimes you'd fall off yah? Stop the gloom and doom bro. BTC is going up from here.
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:52:47
Yo Bitcoin is more like the internet than even most people who compare the two realize bro!  Krugman - one of the most respected economists EVER, said back in 1999 the internet would provide "no economic value" and be worthless. Bitcoin is just the same disruptive tech bangin up the world and the same stupid 'smart' people not able to have vision and an open mind. History is the best way to get a clue on the future but hey man, there gotta be nonbelievers cause that's how shit goes down.
@_date: 2018-10-19 11:35:05
Elon Musk sellin flamethrowers for crypto. You get a useless flamethrower and he gets crypto that will probably be 10x before you ever even find a use for a flamethrower. 
That is why he is innovative and rich ya?.
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:17:11
Agreed 100% bro. He better be getting a salary for posting his shit so often, cause he been wasting a hell of a lot of time spewing shit for no return ya?
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:44:10
Bro you using a whole lot of words to say a whole lot of nothing. You can talk about volcanoes and interest charts all day yah but you got no clue when another price spike or apocalypse or any other shit can happen. We been listening to self proclaimed geniuses tryin to tell us what’s going down with Bitcoin all year and not one of the yahoos were right. What in dafuc do you think you know that the rest of us don’t bro?
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:22:04
Bro, you are way way out there. You’re on a bitcoin sub ya? You really think we all that stupid? You need to go get some basic understanding of crypto. You might as well be posting shit about pie and popcorn, that’s how far out you are bro.
@_date: 2018-10-09 15:09:19
Good on you for taking the high road with this fool bro. Definitely down with this answer ya.
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:20:29
Don’t feed the trolls bro. Think about it..if dumbass trolls really thought that bitcoin was on the way out, they wouldn’t be trying to convince you that it is ya?
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:30:48
What discovery stick man? I wasn't the only one there yo don't act like this is the first rodeo just cause the last one had a bigger crowd show up.
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:37:50
Ya that’s what I thought bro. I could speak whatever language you want. Don’t change facts bro. You don’t need to know shit to come on here and say bitcoin is trash. You got nothin. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:37:41
Bro you must look for the most stupid thing you can possibly post and then test it on here ya? For real, that’s got to be the dumbest thing I’ve read in a while from someone who was actually being serious. You can’t price that shit in bro. What ya think this is a Netflix stock ya? Then you praise your own ass for predicting the future ya? Dafuc? Good laugh for the day though!
@_date: 2018-10-23 20:51:46
Fair enough bro. Hopefully he keeps it on the rails ya?
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:18:29
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:42:55
Imitation is flattery bro. Even if you suck at it ya?
So looks like you got 2 accounts goin ya? How tactful of you bro. You even had to create an email. That’s some genius right there.
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:23:15
A year... Ha ha. Bitcoin is the strongest opportunity of the century. But if all you have is a year then perhaps you should look elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:49:28
You’re hard on yourself. I never called you a noob son, and just because you’re a nasty little critter doesn’t mean anyone needs to tame you. You can run wild and shit all over Reddit posts all day for all I care. At least you found something you’re good at. Rolf.
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:17:11
No, but real as your intellect and your balls. Coward, tough guy on an anonymous thread ya?
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:31:45
Well what'ya know ..I'm not the only one you're attacking on here, ya nasty little brat. So is this your hobby little boy? Pestering the smarter grownups on reddit? For anyone out there who is reading, this little moron troll has been posting nasty shit on my comments and I've never said a word to him before. This shitty nosed little critter needs to buzz off and learn about the crypto world and come back all grown up.  
bakkt is major to crypto little boy, and if you doubt that then you best be off to school and learn something before you try to play with the big boys.  
Daayyam, this is funny as hell boy, I find you here saying the same shit to someone else. Get yourself a life boy, you better than this dumbass crap.
@_date: 2018-10-07 00:54:33
That’s a mystery to you bro? Volume is selling too so less selling less buying and price stays same. Yep sounds right ya?
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:48:52
Bro if you think anything is impossible you gotta be new to crypto yah?
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:15:47
So instead of answering dude’s question we just spitting out random unrelated facts now yah? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 00:53:29
You being mean bro? I know he's way outta line with the age insults but you know he always freaks out like that and now you just poking him for luls. But yeah I laughed a little too bro lol.
@_date: 2018-10-02 21:03:33
Yeah someone needs to drag that xelephonte critter outdoors an shave off his neck beard and make him give his mom back her credit card yo.

you signed the last message bro. This ain’t a formal letter thing yo.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:18:28
Hey nasty lil critter! You still biting and scratching at people's posts like a lil pest? You remindin me of the flies when I was on duty tour. They didn't mean much, were not important, but sure were irritating. Here have a crumb and buzz away now lil critter.  
@_date: 2018-10-15 01:04:21
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:24:50
What’s the beef bro, you don’t like the way I speak yah? This dog wasn’t barking at you so how about you go back to wanking off and looking for attention on pornhub yah?
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:14:58
It’s been 10 years bro and a shit ton has happened... especially this past year. But a year is a drop in the bucket. Took us that long to finally sort out that big spike that last December threw at us. 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:18:48
You're a trash talking moron, got it. What’s that to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-27 15:28:41
Back when you were young? Bitcoin only been around 10 years bro. Anyone got their hands on it then prob are millionaires now ya? and they got no problems hiring a mechanic. So now that you’re all grown up do you still say stupid shit like that?
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:11:57
Welcome my boy welcome 
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:53:11
Layers, upgrades and side chains y’all. This thing is here to stay.
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:34:28
Son, don't waste your time on this little shitty nosed critter. he's like those flies that buzz buzz buzz but never amount to shit. They just irritate ya so you move further away from the shit they eating. Best lesson this little pest can teach you YOU CAN'T FIX STUPID.
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:44:24
Calling it trash ain’t gonna rally the troops.
Bro you must have a shit ton of Bitcoin all ready to go for the next run up ya? When it broke 15k last time me and everyone I known into it all my peeps wish we woulda bought more at the year low of 1k. Well this year low is around about 6k is to where we are now and you want it to soar again ya? So you got lots this time around?
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:49:50
Truth bro. But I’m just calling this little man out on his bitchin. I don’t lose sleep over this little guy.
@_date: 2018-10-08 05:15:27


Guess I did it wrong last few years bro ...BUT in that case I'm lovin this whole being wrong and not understanding finance shit and everyone should give it an honest shot yah?  Volume flat sideways price and a dozen bounces off that bitches bottom baby  ... that's all the ' finance and investing' you gotta know at this moment. Ride this bitch back up again or jump off baby.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:06:55
Agreed son. It takes a legit product to bring em out in numbers.
@_date: 2018-10-29 17:14:05
Because shit is sticky ya?
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:12:47
There’s a lot more subs to divi up the people on here these days. Lots of action on r/bitcoinmarkets 
@_date: 2018-10-01 18:19:22
Bakkt can’t be priced in this is impossible. Price is affected by buying and if bakkt takes off, then it could be buying a pile of Bitcoin. Then it will show in the Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:31:41
Dafuc?! I log in here and see same posters, that’s cool. Discussion is good right?
But why is it always your posts with a SHIT load of words to just say you don’t know what you talking about bro? How ya get to that point bro? Where you state dumb ass opinions like they facts?
@_date: 2018-10-11 11:39:14
Move on bro. I’m the dirty fu$ker in the ditch grabbin what you dropping off there.
@_date: 2018-10-01 14:20:12
This November will change the way we look at everything :)
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:39:30
I don’t hold too long bro but I’m thinkin about it. Every run up I wished I’d bought when it was cheaper. Now is that time for next run ya?
@_date: 2018-10-08 04:34:53
Most def yo. That's how a small minority make money on this shit. When wipes start calling drops and most peeps afraid to touch it, that's when ya buy it like ya hooked on it baby. Ain't no guarantee from the universe but it's the only way you make big if it does yah?
@_date: 2018-10-12 02:00:38
And how do these whales confirm to you that it was “exactly as you suspected” bro? They Skype you on Fridays and unload on you ya?
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:14:33
Cut the shit bro. The ‘holier than thou’ attitude don’t work when you’re transparent and shallow as all hell ya? I been kickin bitcoin around for years and you little troll shits are a dime a dozen. You either 1 of these 2:
1. Bought at all time high, got burned and don’t realize it been growing for years. Now every day you marching against bitcoin like a good little trooper fighting the fight because bitcoin hurt your feelings ya?
2. Nocoiner that comes on here every day to grab a hold of some feeling of relevancy... cause life sucks that bad for you bro, that you rather try and see if you can make someone else feel as shitty as you do. Guess what? You got no skin in the game... your opinion don’t mean shit.
Which one are you bro?
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:14:08
Yep It is overvalued bro, some 100% some 300+%, I’m afraid for some that I’m swingin on now. Might bail on them cause they blowing up like a balloon and gonna go bang bang.
What dafuc is dude talking about pullin crap out of his ass for, he in the wrong sub man yah?
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:33:01
Plenty of mysteries out there bro. Like this guy seems like he really believes what he’s sayin ya?
@_date: 2018-10-08 05:08:38


Ha ha Woooooo! Baby ..have another drink with your butt buddies. Keep trying to scare the peeps bro. Any fool stupid enough to get spooked by your little stories ain't making it up the food chain anyway ya?
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:32:40
Hey bro you just strung together a bunch of sentences that make no sense. You should talk to a few miners or coders yah? Maybe listen to a few interviews with peeps in the know. Get the low down on scaling and stop making random jiberish posts. 600GB don’t mean shit if you can’t back up the trash talk bro.
@_date: 2018-10-03 12:24:40
Patience mah people patience. If you’re hoping to see the price grow then you’re gonna have to let it catch up to the world. Bitcoin ain’t going anywhere and this past few years have been serious branching out from when I first  jumped on this ride babies.
I still got messages from people telling me I was a dreamer because there was no way Bitcoin could go over 1000. Don’t be those people. The first years were slowww. If you don’t have patience now then you’d have never survived 2014.2015.
@_date: 2018-10-08 05:20:08
Why not bro? You been shootin shit about everything else you don't know anything about why stop on the price prediction? Whip out ya crystal ball and smack us with that price baby.
@_date: 2018-10-02 19:58:37
Fool Probably bought his first full bitcoin at 20k 
@_date: 2018-10-08 05:11:13
I never said that shit then I'm sayin it now. You ain't down with that s'all cool with me bro. I'm sayin what I'm sayin and you sayin what you sayin. That's reddit ya?
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:19:15
Looks like somebody lookin to jumpstart the ol volatility engine ya?
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:28:14
All you do is talk trash about other posters bro. That’s how I saw you on here ya? I stepped in because you were talkin down on someone and now you shit talk me too.
Just cause you not smart enough to talk crypto don’t mean you gotta trash talk users bro. Not cool.
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:58:55
Bit extreme hate you got goin on there for Musk bro.
@_date: 2018-10-21 16:06:46
Just a matter of time bro. Long as people got realistic expectations. Future got Bitcoin in it in a big way so we just gotta let time do its thing ya?
@_date: 2018-10-23 01:25:34
You shouldn’t be in here bro. You’re far too insecure. Oh yeah and you’re an ignorant asshole! Almost forgot that lol.
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:49:39
You tell me bro. What more is there for little shits like you to say on an anonymous reddit where neck beards can act brave. I got nothing to be fake about yah. I know in person I’d take you down with one arm tied :).
Too bad you gotta he such a little shit I came back to this Reddit group to chit chat bitcoin yah not throw word shit at you. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 16:58:00
Depends on the person bro. But yeah you prob right and that's cause younger peeps don't need to adapt in big steps because they tech users by default. By the time the new generation get into investing Bitcoin will explode.
@_date: 2018-10-12 21:29:10
Is that a joke bro? Yeah I’m sure Valken is more knowledgeable than Rounini in blockchain technology. If ya want to go on what we know bout both their resumes plus how they both answered the questions that’s a given man. 
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:31:48
That’s what I thought
@_date: 2018-10-08 05:17:09
If BTC drops to 100 that's when we gonna all wish that nuke war or asteroid strike never happened yah?
@_date: 2018-10-25 12:05:54
It takes a real big person to mock someone with a shitty anonymous user name on a Reddit sub. This sub is about bitcoin ya? You should have stayed in school bro.
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:49:42
Bro only a fool would answer that
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:23:51
Dude you sound like a 5 year old trying to explain physics for the first time. Especially that last part, that was rich bro. Not as much money to catch up with the changes. What ya think they working with an etch a sketch over at Coinbase yah? Stop trying to explain shit you have zero understanding of bro.
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:32:17
WhatsApp Facetime whateve bro, just messing.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:30:57
So when bitcoin becomes a functional currency replay that scenario bro. Everyone is in a rush as if something as huge as money can be transformed in 5 or 10 years. It would take generations. Years of growing pains. But right now this is a high risk market and a lot of us are betting on Bitcoin for tomorrow. Not now cause once bitcoin becomes a currency the chance to profit by buying early will have taken a hike ya?
What’s with everyone saying bitcoin failed anyway are they all brain dead? Did the Internet fail because it didn’t accomplish high speed transfers right out the gate bro? I mean it did take 25 years to make it in the household with dial up access. Did the dream of going to space fail cause they blew up a pile of rockets and killed a bunch of people? Things take time and naysayers are a part of every tech’s early days. They’re always there to poke and make schoolyard comments like hecklers in the audience. Meanwhile they do nothing to contribute.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:19:22
Not fake, but the ETP is not a full fledged ETF. Think of  Grayscale Investment’s Bitcoin trust in the US. It's similar to that where the investment represents the value of the crypto. These lower prices are great entry points for any product ya? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:16:20
So you're a play it safe kinda guy bro. Nothin wrong with it but lots of us like a little risk. If it ain't bitcoin it's another high risk play. This game is for everyone everywhere. You can put 10 bucks in the game or as much as you want. No need to be on here telling people about your personal take on risk bro, nobody really cares cause they gonna do what they gonna do.
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:46:49
Bro .. dude means it's a huge potential to invest in. You're probably not gonna buy yourself a fuckin pipeline tomorrow either, but you'd have done well to invest in ExxonMobile. You don't have the brains to use sarcasm so just STFU.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:04:16
Don't work like magic bro, but a little thought on what the possibilities are can take you there. You think this is the only one that will be approved? Expect a long line to follow, and then there's bakkt, Fidelity, etc. Let time do its job and we'll get there.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:10:29
Yeah? Well you put 10k in then or this past January and you lost the same. Well unless you shorted like most of us did ya?
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:15:56
You don’t need to use up your crayons for me. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:25:25
Probably cause bitcoin went from pennies to thousands of dollars bro. Most alt coins went from pennies to 0. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:29:25
Seriously you just fucking pounded your own stupid little troll face with that comment bro. My post was about bitcoin not being dead. See when I owned BTC at 1k and it dropped back to 200 bucks we lost the same amount as if it dropped from 20k back to 4k. It wasn’t dead at 200 buck and it isn’t dead now at 4K. So I’m saying if stock shares were 4K each would you call that company fucking dead? Catch up little troll comon your hampster is falling asleep at the wheel. Yeah trolls are fucking dimwits but you could pretend to be smarter than a little shit who comes to a bitcoin forum to spew verbal diarrhea about tulips ha ha. Broke ass basement dwelling neck beard dweeb.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:13:22
Give it up bro. Stock terms like that don’t apply to crypto and you have enough sense to grasp that ya?
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:36:05
Bro I would NEVER give financial advice. I leave that to self proclaimed money managers on groups like this who get a boner telling the rest of us about their philosophy on investing. Like anyone gives a shit. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:53:06
Kind of ironic how the greed of the Bcash creation was disguised as wanting to benefit the community ya? But the truth is the greedy bastards never gave a single shit about decentralization. Bcash has been poison and confusion to the Bitcoin community from the start, and placed a speed bump in the bitcoin growth path. Bitcoin will thrive anyway but there was no need of Bcash slowing down progress in this way. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:00:32
So you holding bro? Blockchain fan boy took it up the ass by buying the top and now you wanna let out your frustrations by posting your diaries of a jaded boy who invested more than he could afford to lose ya? Wrote the book and call it “I Blame My Stupidity on Bitcoin Cause all the Trolls are Doing it...A Troll’s Memoirs””
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:00:33
You wouldn't know what's good for bitcoin bro, you just talk shit with no depth. Understand why something is good for Bitcoin ... then you can talk your shit.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:13:44
I mean staring at it won't make it green bro, just an expression. You can try to trade if you have enough in there to work with. You can't predict that some whale is gonna pump or dump and until more players join the game whales will have that power. But you can go along for the ride with them. If they pump it sell it and buy it back when it dumps.
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:36:57
If you were to scale it l, it would be closer to the guy that owns several McDonalds bro but nowhere close to the fast food industry. That by the way is a shitty thing to say and sheds a lot of light on your perspective. I’ve hired a lot of workers equivalent to the McDonalds employee you look down upon in your ego driven little man comment and they’re each twice the man you are and tripple the maturity. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:07:36
SO? It's their money to grow or to lose right?
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:54:07
That’s an understatement bro. Trolls actually made good points in 2014. Yeah they were wrong but they understood the shit they were saying and the cheap shots they were taking. Today it’s just total garbage like they’re in kindergarten or some shit.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:57:59
What's the fundamental analysis of that big stack of cash on the poker table? Crypto got it all, bet 10 bucks or bet 10k, no minimum entry. If Bitcoin becomes the digital accounting system for the next generation then the game gets even bigger. Either way it's a no brainer. I'm no sucker but if I got a grand I don't mind losing I'm not gonna have any hangups with throwing it in the crypto pot in the chance it can turn into 10 grand. And I ain't alone in that way of thinking. Life is short and little risk here and there keeps it interesting. Risk is a big industry.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:08:53
Then I guess you don't gamble. Keep playin it safe bro what you do is your business what anyone else does with their money for risk taking is theirs.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:49:26
Good good. go make a million. Not my business what you do. I hope you do man.
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:57:54
Yeah but the general public could barley buy this stuff up until recently. The wait que for an exchange was worse than the line up at Disney and most never got in to catch the lift. Why would anyone who got a little risk money not give it a shot? It’s no worse than high risk stocks and you don’t see that market going away right? And on top of that Bitcoin is only now starting to get layers and side chains and proposed ETFs and apps and SEC regulations. Mining equipment will evolve with the scale of computing and a whole new generation of digital gurus are soon gonna be of age to have some disposable income to invest. They gonna eat this shit up because it flows with their digital world. Bitcoin is just coming out of the shadows after 10 years of getting its legs. It’s up up up for years man. Anyone on here that is trolling is not doing it in your best interest they’re doing it because they got nothing else to get their kicks from. At least you can say greed brings us crypto investors to this sub. What brings those guys here bro? If anyone thinks they’re all good people worried about the well being of investors they’re delusional.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:21:05
If you close your eyes and concentrate you can feel the spite and anger of the pissed little bcashers selling all bitcoin holdings to replace their massive losses.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:14:56
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:00:39
You still here bro? Still losing all your money being a little bitcoin fanboy as always hey? I never saw a closet bitcoin fanboy who had it bad as you before. Nobody as bad as you.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:13:52
Moron LOL, yeah you wanna try and explain your little shit fit on that comment 'ETP'. You gonna explain finances to me little man? I know the difference in ETP and ETF he he. But you gotta calm the ol temper there bro. If you calling people morons over semantics then you gonna lose your shit when you find your woman star-fished with a stranger ya?
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:38:31
What the fawk is wrong with you all? Are you all little children with mommies iPad or some shit? shorters braggin when it drops holders bragging when it runs up, rinse and repeat for years and you all still act like it’s all new or some shitfaced neckbeard saying he predicted it last summer like hes the only one to make a guess. Follow it, short it, hold it but what’s the deal with everyone trashin everyone else? You’re all playing the same market and sorry to disappoint you dimwits who think it’s dead but this is a bigger market now than it’s ever been y’all. It’ll go up and it’ll drop back and it’ll go up again.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:58:50
You probably don't even own a bitcoin....just bullshit from the cheap seats cause you got no life.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:55:15
Trade it and short it down. Trade it and accumulate it up. Simple shit and I'm well in the green over 4 years.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:33:14
One last time. For all you egomaniacs out there telling us all how to spend/waste/gamble/invest (take your pick ya cause you all seem to have your own preferred insult) go worry about yourselves for the love of fuck. No really just go and invest in you and let us gamble or make our high risk investment the way we want to. You guys think you're the only ones who have sense because some of us actually enjoy and can stomach a little risk? IT'S OUR CHOICE.
Don't come on here telling what to do with my own damn money you lunatics. If I wanna name every dollar I have after each one of you high-horse trolls and light it on fire and sing while it burns that my business. You get that? MY BUSINESS. Mind your shit and I'll mind mine ya?
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:37:43
You talkin like this is new information to you bro. Did you just get discovered in the rain forest or some shit? This is exactly what many people have been comparing the crypto market to for years... and years. It always crashes hard and it always takes another trip to bounce harder off of a higher ceiling. And then the crash is even bigger and shakes the fucking ground. And you know what else??? The next high is gonna trap even more FOMO infected investors in a higher buy in and crash their asses even harder to the ground and lives will be wrecked like an earthquake wrecks not like the train of the last one. So you either know when to get in and when to get out or you go along for the ride until you’re shook to shit inside.
...or you don’t play but act like those dipshits in the cheap seats who wanted to be in the game but likes to pretend they know how to make the best shots. Easiest. Most lazy position.
@_date: 2018-11-19 04:08:16
Oh also .. 20k btc please. Like you got 20k btc bro. I know people who have plenty of BTC and they don't waste time trying to make people believe they have a clue like you're doing. They don't need to prove shit to anyone.
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:57:40
Yeah bro, but keep it small no selling the farm shit. It’s a fun market and the last few years have been up and down like a whore house so you won’t be bored. My advice? Know when to sell and learn how to short.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:47:23
You again? Bro, smart people don't beg for validation. You're NEVER right about anything. Why the hell would anyone respect your crazy ranting?
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:20:44
Rants from a nut job. Bro you’d be the perfect blueprint if anyone wanted to build an idiot.
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:37:27
Just an instance of it with a ten year head start, biggest dev community, most nodes and hash power, never been hacked, never gone down .... you get the point. If it weren’t for bitcoin nobody would be talking about blockchain. Period.
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:50:05
COMON seriously!! That shit is old school. Today's internet is all about social sharing and streaming and shit. Bitcoin's network value as a digital currency and value store aligns perfectly with it ya? How are you not seeing that bro!?
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:40:08
Weak bro. But what always annoys me about your posts is ya make the most stupid trolls look half smart ya?
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:37:24
What are you smoking bro? You’re the strangest of strange. Bitcoin ads??? Common man join the real world where we all know that never happened.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:38:03
It's money I can afford to lose. What the hell I need a loan for? Anyone that gambles money they don't have got problems that bog them down whether or not Bitcoin ever existed. They'd blow it somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:13:50
It's a risk bro, it's  a bet. Anyone that places bets are responsible for their own actions and as long as they didn't play with money they couldn't afford to lose so what? It's a bit of fun! If they bet too much cause they listened to the media then that's called NATURAL SELECTION.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:10:45
Bro you’re among the 5% of people in this sub that actually understand the big picture. Last few bull runs were the silver lining to the troll swatting but today the trolls gave up actually learning anything about bitcoin ya? They just pretend they can spit out some crap they read on the toilet about investing and think they have a clue. You just crushed this little troll and he didn’t even realize it. He’s not the smartest but he still had it coming. More of your commments would be welcome in here bro. Happy Thanksgiving.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:11:34
Sorry bro but the last 12000 people that ~~predicted~~ GUESSED the price already took the last of the lollipops.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:06:35
Bro if I knew that I'd be betting more than I could afford to lose wouldn't I? Only a fool predicts prices in crypto for specific dates. It's going up over years to come though that looks pretty clear ya? Unless the internet crashes and burns and the teenagers decide to abandon digital by the time they're running shit.
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:17:27
Bro comon you CAN’T be that stupid. How many of ‘YOUR’ stock shares are 4K a piece? How many different stock option have you invested in that are 4K a share? You say 1000s and expect to fucking make it through natural selection? 1000s???? Get your little ass back in school boy comon.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:15:03
This is the kind of shit thy brings the entire Reddit IQ down right there. Stay in school kids. Fawk, bro you got hit with the stupid stick front on too ya?
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:56:25
It's happening ya'll. The forcasted drop is happening and next is the climb. Plus those brain dead trolls that only show up when the price drops are gonna finally disappear forever soon. DAYAM I love November. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:20:05
Crypto!! Yes bro, that’s the fucking sum of this douche bag’s entire existence ya? Don’t feed the trolls they said nobody said shit about feeding the scum feeding on the troll shit. Now we got a name for dat scum bro.. Xelephonte - troll shit scum. Let’s feed that shit sucker and see if it grows a brain ya?? Little critter been acting like a freak l since day 1 that I came back on this sub.
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:22:19
20 BTC .... oooooh don’t spend it all at once little critter. Bro you’re not smart enough to send a BTC wallet address let alone own bitcoin. Tell that bullshit to someone stupid as you to believe it.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:03:26
You believe that shit too that’s what makes it fucked. Must be awkward for you ya?

Naw bro. The Bcash thing is interrupting.. has been... interrupting bitcoin. The growth in this space is way bigger than the price so the price will most likely catch up. For a really small time the price was bigger than the growth ya? Then the growth had to catch up. Bitcoin market is cyclical for that reason. Watch and see don’t take my word for it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:00:10
Who cares bro? A critter is a critter. Was back in the 1400's and still is today. Low crawler, annoying and ya can't trust em. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:44:04
Over your head ya? Ok let me try again. Initially the internet was not considered valuable outside a small group of niche users. It was slow and limited right? It was technically way above the average person and had no real use. People who saw the potential said hey let’s build this shit and bring it to everyone. It can do the job of shopping and teaching and banking and .... wait stop there says the pompous know it alls (you)! This is worthless it will never replace mail or any of the nonsense you’re claiming. Now here we are.
Bitcoin can easily serve as a currency and store of value and send millions around the world effortlessly and secure as fuck. But people without the ability to see forward (you) are like no way, this is worthless it will never do those things. If you don’t see where this is going then that’s your choice bro. But don’t be condemning a future that is at least as likely to happen as is to not happen. You don’t have to be all for it but open your mind maybe? .. your choice.
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:57:18
What company sells the drugs your on bro? I wanna invest in that company cause that's some potent shit. You talk like someone who knows nothing but pretends he knows everything.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:02:09
Already done bro. The ETF was approved by Switzerland for Amun Crypto, a U.K. based fintech company. Begin trading on Six Swiss Exchange next week, Switzerland’s chief stock exchange. Check the ticker..   **$HODL!** 
@_date: 2018-11-23 00:29:06
Nothing to stop it from going down and nothing to stop it from going up cause it’s human greed that drives both bro.
@_date: 2018-11-01 22:08:25
The November to remember starts now. Trolls... by all means enter your dumb comments below ya? None of you have said a single thing that I haven't already heard many times over the years. The lead up to another FOMO scenario begins this month.
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:49:07
There you go with more of your bullshit. That sounds like too much work bro and I don’t give two fucks about votes. Vote me down if that makes you feel good. Slam that vote button baby. Insecure much? Ba ha ha ha what a freak.
@_date: 2018-11-21 03:34:40
No no you’re not paying attention. It was going to go down anyway and it can still run up again over a longer track bro. I’m talkin about people taking credit for predicting this exact scenario as if hailing them as oracles is what matters in this market.
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:21:55
So 4K a bitcoin is dead bro? When we were all scramblin on The drop from 1k back to a few hundred a few years back was it dead then? Cause the stupid little trolls were on here then spittin out garbage then too but then it ramped up to 20k and now we been shorting it all the way down and still making cash. This ride dead now bro? At 4K? Fucking brains are rare in this sub ya?
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:50:11
He implied that bitcoin is the devil ya bro. Ha
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:45:25
Because risk takers like a market like this to pump their bets on and inflate the price. Profit takers like cashing out and then it deflates. Simple rinse and repeat. Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose and have a little fun.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:02:11
You got no skin in the game ... your input is worth shit to me bro.
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:20:44
So you did ZERO research on what bitcoin is bro? Wow... just..wow. At least try man.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:00:57
Yeah but if it hurts your brain trying to wrap it around this new entity of bitcoin as a market and a value store and a currency and a tough as shit global blockchain network, well bro then bitcoin ain’t for you. Simple.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:48:18
I don't care what you do. That's my point. 7+billion people in the world bro, you gonna scold them all for buying a little bitcoin cause you think it's evil or some stupid thing? Mind your own business and enjoy your Avenue de Grande Bretagne  lol.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:43:53
That’s it bro. Let it out.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:16:53
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:33:32
I'm all about usage and tech and yeah, Bitcoin got some serious potential that most of us haven't even thought about yet. But usage is not what drives things in this young crypto land bro. You really think everyone who threw their hat in the game last year did it for the usage? It was lotto ticket purchase for most of them. And yeah they'll play the lotto again cause if it ain't long term stocks it's playin a risk. Next pot gonna be bigger too.
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:07:20
For now ya. Just not an end as much as end of this round. Crypto market is way bigger as a market anyway than before. Speculation is big business bro. A lot of deep pockets with money to gamble for a new game in town to add to their choices to roll the dice. Don’t worry about unhappy endings just worry about when you buy and when you sell. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:15:38
You’re completely fucked bro. You need to get laid or something. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:34:04
Hopefully you’re pretending you’re stupid.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:09:44
Hey y'all after a long time kicking around the Bitcoin ball here is what I can say is fairly certain (nothing is definite in crypto land):
\- Nobody in the past 4-5 years has accurately predicted price worth a F\*
\- People will trade and can make money REGARDLESS of the price
\- There will be another bull market because there's plenty of people who love high risk for high gain
\- That run up will crash again because people also love profit taking
\- This cycle will continue until the crypto market is as common as any other stock. Then the highs and lows won't be as extreme
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:32:36
Ignorant pompous self proclaimed know it all. You think everyone with a stake in bitcoin is lazy bro? That makes you an idiot hands fucking down.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:22:42
You think that shit don’t happen in the stock market bro? That shit was BORN in the stock market.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:44:09
See? Just cause you spent your youth doing that stupid shit doesn't mean anyone else did. I risked what I could afford and it paid off big for 2 years. This past year was a stinker. Let's see what next year holds. If you're a little blockchain fanboy that's your life bro and I couldn't give a shit. I'm in it for the coin.
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:02:18
I can’t possibly upvote this enough. Very well said bro.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:21:55
Yeah, but nobody predicted the price bro. Everyone knows a bubble is gonna deflate, been that way forever. But nobody knew it would stop at 12k, 15k, 20k etc. That's why not everyone got cashed out out on time. My point was nobody has been able to predict the 'price' accurately.
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:41:04
You need to learn to think is all I’m sayin here. Manipulation of price or market got ZERO to do with the stability and security of the bitcoin network. They are not connected or related in any way and how you don’t realize that just makes me wonder why you comment. I don’t know shit about open heart surgery so I don’t go on medical forums and connect the wrong dots.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:24:26
You ... are ... wrong. You buy when the prices are beat up not at ATH! It's the same with stock market or any investment bro. People don't choose to never buy again, they learn from the experience.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:02:09
If you are going to be buying Bitcoin anyway then I'd say buy it now ya? Don't buy it at 6600...8000..15000! You buy it now.
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:48:07
Torrents lol. So technologically you’re stuck in 2010. Which explains your desperate attempts to apply financial logic to bitcoin ya? You have this basic understanding of finances an dumb as a stump with tech.
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:00:27
People are thinking it’s the same entity dumping 400 BTC in regular intervals. Somebody is pissed off and trying to best down a certain alt coin through Bitcoin ya? After all, when the kind drops on price so does the alts.
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:35:19
Thanks for the comic relief douche. lol.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:40:05
It's your money. Wipe your ass with it if that's what makes it valuable to you. If you don't have the sense to keep it down to money you can afford to lose then you were gonna lose it anyway. That's not on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:43:28
Bro I actually enjoyed that comment. No bullshit no trolling. Good on ya!! I love dividend stocks and I’ll probably not sell mine until I’m old and gray. But bitcoin has the potential to be the future of accounting a currency and a store of value in a digital society and that’s gonna take some time bro. For now it’s a risk market for some fun!
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:25:47
The successful kind cause with the rate this shit is growing, they gonna have to be successful to beat out the competition and stick around.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:16:04
Ya bro they missing something if they getting kicks out of preaching their shit on here. I'm in it for the money and they can all kiss my ass.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:49:10
Throwing your dollars into a pot in case they go 10X is not as much as an investment as it is spinning the wheel ya? Online poker Vegas Football bets man the whole  world can bet on crypto cause this game sees no borders. A sucker don't know what he's gettin into and yeah people probably sold homes last  and they were suckers. But the betting crowd are plenty. And it's money they want to risk so that's not a sucker bro that's placing your bet and this game is getting big.
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:09:03
So just another day for you ya?
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:48:47
You’re confusing crypto for your iq bro. Hang in there you’ll learn when the next run starts. Ain’t nothing sweeter than trolls silenced by a big bitcoin smashing down on their bullshit with those stupid litttle looks on their faces ya? This will be my third time enjoying the show and it never ever gets old bro.
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:22:07
Strong argument bro you da maine.
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:52:18
Yo bro you’re talking to the biggest turd on Reddit right there. Dude preaches like a snake oil salesman from the 1800s about bullshit nobody cares about.
Now you I actually agree with but that neveragain nut job wouldn’t know crypto from a notepad file he he.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:11:12
That’s your come back bro? Weak as shit cause you just got OWNED.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:03:52
Ya hope you made a big haul off all that. Looking back at the charts pretty accurate right? So you saw those big dildo pumps? you saw 20k was the stop for the last run up? Cause a lot of people knew how things were going but nobody knew when and if you're trading you better know when. Some Bitcoin spikes happened within 20 minutes. You better have some kind of fancy TA in your toolbox to catch that shit. You guys right? There's always one in every crowd.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:50:38
You walk away and check it next year. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:12:00
You should have stayed quiet bro at least you could pretend you had half a clue ya? A peer to peer torrent system gives us the redundancy needed to fast track file sharing and verify the file wasn’t tampered with. So if you’re transferring a file that represents a placeholder for an amount of wealth on a global ledger that is (in the opinion of many who are way the fuck smarter than you) likely to become the accounting system of the future then ya it hold value. But the complacent troll type will not see that value don’t pop a blood vessel trying to understand it bro. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:16:44
Does it hurt your brain trying to understand how to value something that you never had to value before bro? New and innovative are not your wheelhouse ya? And so you know that exact post you just made was made in 2014 so you copied the idea and changed he numbers ... to make them HIGHER by the way, geeees it grew over the past 4 years imagine that ya? Or you just have the same mindset bitcoin bashers had back then. Either way it was stupid then and still means nothing.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:58:57
You run with that lie bro. Run with it.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:33:23
I spotted your nursey just the other day bro while star gazing from my observatory. I was looking for the alignment of the planets that trigger the rise of bitcoin when a planet like object caught my attention. To my dismay it was not part of the expect alignment. No it was something much different.
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:12:57
Truth bro. But the trolls should still be smarter than to tar us all with the same brush. People who stereotype are less intelligent that’s a proven fact.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:30:46
You don’t grasp digital accounting. You’re stuck in the 90’s. You’d totally be one of those guys who claimed the internet was useless cause it served no purpose and used too much electricity. You should snag your thoughts and revisit them in 10 years. You’d learn a lot about how much you don’t know.
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:05:28
Wow you must be another brainless troll. Ok so let’s talk slow. How about you read it slow. Empty your mind (should be easy). Now repeat after me: A 4k bitcoin is not a good time to call bitcoin dead. Bitcoin was 200 bucks a very short time ago and now it’s 4k. So if it hits 200 bucks again you can troll some more and maybe even feel better ya? But for now bitcoin is a healthy 4K.
So you trade stocks often big shot? Tell me this. Have you ever seen a stock shoot up 2x 3x and then fall back to where it was 3 years ago and still the company is doing just fine? So let’s forget about your limited ability to evaluate 0s and 1s you’ve already shown us your as technical as a wooden leg but think about what qualifies a company as dead. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:58:28
Yeah bro cause the digital generation are gonna ignore this digital investment ya? Common now, use your brain. Bitcoin is just starting to get its legs.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:45:06
So don’t put in more than you can afford to lose bro. If you don’t invest what are you whining about on here? Oh wait you’re a Good Samaritan just hoping to save our souls and no other agenda ya? Fawk everyone thinks they’re an expert these days because they read a piece of click bait saying all bitcoin investors are painted with the same stereotype. 
Loads of us made money in here and 9 out 10 years if you bought it you’d be up now. Many that traded it or shorted it made money this year. So what about you ... just here to vent? Bitcoin got you so heated you figured you’d come to a bitcoin sub and announce how delusional we all are hey? Good for you bro you must be proud. You’re smart and we’re all idiots.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:36:25
No bro. You should read shit before you comment. It happened several times... period. So don’t assume everyone is losing money because you read that shit in a toilet article.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:08:52
Well bro you can’t go back past last year cause you’re clearly fucking a child. Last year was great but years before were shit years and little nut jobs with small dicks like you said the exact same shit then too.
@_date: 2018-11-19 04:25:08
 This is not a guy who seems to have the interest of decentralization at heart lol. This was year ago already when Roger flipped out and kept repeating how rich he is. And people wonder why Bitcoin is still the king.  
[ 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:49:00
You’re way the fuck off bro. Bitcoin IS the network. Blockchain is the dot com of today. Companies started adding dot com to their names and never really had a company but their stock blew up. All last year companies were adding blockchain buzz word to their company name and their stock blew up. Now their all gone but like the internet .. Bitcoin which started the whole blockchain buzz.. is still here.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:02:07
Nice timing bro. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:43:29
As pathetic as trolling is bro at least the other trolls put a little effort in it ya? Repeating the exact same shit that everyone was saying in 2014 is lame AF. COMON little troll put some effort into it!! Lazy little troll.
@_date: 2018-11-19 06:06:50
See my reply to [KalEll66]( below
@_date: 2018-11-23 13:45:19
Oh “that’s” why you’re here ya? Why didn’t you say? I just thought you were a loser with no life who was throwing out the ol tired tulips comments cause you were a noob who thought that insult was still fresh! Sorry bro, I was underwater a few years back too. I thought trading bitcoin worked like trading stocks son it took a few years to learn the market. Short it down and ride it up baby. Sorry for your loss bro but you should never invest more than you can lose right? You should never have been a little bitcoin blockchain fanboy, that was a bad decision.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:07:06
Naw it's a gamble bro. It's fun. Loosen up. If you put in more than you can loose that's on you.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:00:23
Ya. Sure bro. Try again.
@_date: 2018-11-19 04:19:41
This is not a guy who seems to have the interest of decentralization at heart lol. This was year ago already when Roger flipped out and kept repeating how rich he is. And people wonder why Bitcoin is still the king.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:31:03
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:10:13
Of course bro. Why would any smart company launch when the bottom is coming in? The better the entry point the better the return and the owners of the NYSE know what they're doing. Anyone thinks they're smarter then ICE in the land of markets needs a head check.
@_date: 2018-11-19 05:58:51
Go long bro. This is not a bad thing, not a bad thing at all. Think about it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:42:52
So you holding bro? Blockchain fanboy? I’m just putting money I can afford to lose in the pot and I’m still in the green after 4 years. Blockchain doesn’t need to care about me nut job. I’m gambling and I like the rush. Think about that the next time you whack off getting your kicks trolling crypto market players. Go on loser do it ya? Get those hand out of your fried chicken and troll some more. Oooooh yeah you got it made. Ha ha ha.
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:04:11
Posting the same thing multiple times per day don’t make it any less bullshit bro. You’re bored ya?
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:55:44
Lived it bro twice before. Noobs here today don’t fully grasp how this is exactly the same and in a big world there’s plenty of players for this market..... Pulllleennnttyy
@_date: 2018-11-23 14:36:52
The very bare bone basics of at least having the slightest of a clue what bitcoin is would be to understand that it is a ledger. Bro if you don’t have that then you got no right to be poking your bullshit in this sub. Now that ain’t being a bitcoin fanboy or any of that crap, that was the most fair statement I’ve probably made in here. It’s an accounting system. It’s digital currency ya but that will take generations and we’ll be old and gray by then. So for now it’s a market and it’s a fun as shit one of you can get your head out of your ass. If you really think bitcoin will keep sinking short it on BitMex we’ve made a killing there. Or you can stay in this thread pretending to know the future of bitcoin without even knowing what a ledger is ya? Come back down to earth bro.
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:27:33
You’re delusional bro. You keep talking down to everyone on here as though we’re all beneath you but you make the most clueless posts of anyone on here. I’ve seen a lot of people like you over my years in crypto and in the stock market too. Difference with you bro is that you seem to believe your bullshit. At least trolls are half smart.
@_date: 2018-11-23 05:13:17
It’s typical to compare shit to what you know so at least you’re making an effort bro 
@_date: 2018-11-21 01:12:49
You’re still here bro spitting out stock terms that many of us use every day on the trad market, you don’t seem to have a clue what they mean if you’re even including them in a bitcoin market. So no shortage of you fools no.
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:05:31
So if the world was full of peeps like you we’d have nothing. No tech nothing. Know what we’d have bro? Bullshit. Everything would be bullshit. And you be eaten cause you’d be the stupid slow one the rest of us would outrun ya?
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:58:25
Opinions are like assholes bro. Take a look at this thread and read some of the pathetic comments from trolls. I mean I’m not a conspiracy theorist so I doubt the theory that they are getting paid to hang out in Reddit and post trash against bitcoin and even if they were that’s perhaps the most pathetic possibility ya? 
I think they need to lash out at us to make their pathetic existence feel less painful. Think about it. Misery loves company and some fool told them bitcoin investors are all in pain now. And they only show up when the price is down!!
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:27:29
Dumb sits on the barrel bottom, then you lift the barrel and your little fat face in the shit peeks through.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:27:20
Thousands of nodes securing the most powerful network on the globe compared to a white paper concept with no functional network. You don’t comprehend that you should not be commenting bro. Go talk about shit you understand.

Then sell your shit and gtfo. Simple.
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:31:01
Solid advice bro. People like that neveragain blowhard egomaniac are toxic to this space.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:18:48
No upset here bro. But your TA is gonna work better on stocks then crypto. You know what I'm saying if you been around long because the pumps are big and the they're fast. No catching that with TA.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:25:01
I don’t invest I alts bro. Well that’s not true, I have made some legit gains on Stellar. What do you care what I buy if you don’t invest? I mean you got nothin goin on? ‘Kid’ lulz
Edit: Not that it matters but crypto is playtime money for me bro. I am solid career wise. I like this game and you shouldn’t give a shit what anyone else does. I also like playin hunt the stupidest troll. You just haven’t caught on yet.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:24:36
So all the Trolls too slow to understand they don’t get to take credit for their little guesses on their paper crystal balls right? Y’all not even gonna acknowledge that this price hit is connected to the Bcash circus? All your little smart ass school yard comments and none of you are gonna admit that this has very little to do with investors losing interest but actually a big sell off from a whole other incentive?
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:24:30
Bro common. He knows you never said that, he’s a useless troll trying to bait you and he’s not smart enough to be worth your while. He just knows your pro bitcoin bro and want to feel important by getting attention. Don’t give guys like that the time of day.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:07:28
No one posted on reddit on 1990 either. The diarrhea coming out of your mouth must make your ass jealous ya?
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:42:58
Hey little smart ass do you say that to peeps who drop a little coin on high risk stocks too bro? Or are you just not educated enough to understand that not everyone who buys a little crypto are looking to get rich any more than those who drop a little in stocks? Sounds like you’re a troll sheep and not the smartest one.
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:56:42
Hey all you lazy little Rollie Pollie Trolls. Have even a single one if you clueless little shits been here longer than a year? Am I the only one that messed with bitcoin when it was in the hundreds? Cause you dumb little brain dead fucks can’t do math or you can’t get your dicks out of your hands long enough to Google the price of bitcoin before last year? It’s in the thousands today. How many of your stock shares are 4K a piece? Go on take a look and let us know. Cause I play a lot of stocks and NOT ONE of em are near 4k per share. So why in the flyin fuck are you calling bitcoin dead?? If you’re calling time of death at 4K then the shit you had for brains must have ran down over your sunlight deprived little basement eyes ya?
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:01:54
Who you shootin fool? Yourself is about it ya?
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:57:34
fawkin right bro. If you EVER bought bitcoin in the past year, why the hell wouldn't you buy it now ya?
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:22:40
Yeah a thousand people with a thousand guesses. No prize for the lucky winner bro sorry. Did you bet on that guess with a good trade or short? 
@_date: 2018-11-19 04:03:32


...and everything before that bullshit too bro. You're like a child ranting about some shit nobody gives a flying crap about. Stop trying to preach you're spamming the sub with useless garbled shit.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:14:24
Right now it’s a risk play bro. There’s no minimum entry fee and if you wanna play with 10 bucks or 10k you’re good to go. If you play the game with more than you can afford to lose that’s on you and bitcoin got nothing to do with that decision. Currency is years away but easily possible in a digital world. Right now the crypto market is a growing casino and a little risk for fun is alright ya? 
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:08:17
You don't ever use 'sure' and 'bro' together like that bro.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:21:03
No losses here bro. Lol your ignorance is surpassed only by your ego. You assume I’m at a loss cause you never learned that bitcoin is 10 years old. 9 years of gains and a price of pennies to thousands and your ego enslaved your thinking to assume everyone is at a loss because of one bad year ya?

Bro really? That's bullshit and you know it. Even if it were fact, the price ain't 3.8k yet. If it does drop there and stay there for a while we'll see. Until then stop posting shit. The OP's entire point is that you buy now if you wanna play this game, not at 20k.

Well you should assume I’m not intelligent I suppose bro! If that brings you happiness I’m glad to have added some false sense of self esteem to your life. You’re welcome.
