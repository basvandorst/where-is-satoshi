The easiest thing I can think of is that the customers enter their orders on tablets mounted around the bar. Those tablets display a unique QR code. Once the payment is made the order is displayed to the bartender on a tablet behind the bar and the bartender can make the drink. Damn, I should start that company and make a thousand bitcoins!

No more unnecessary than calling an encrypted private key a "wallet."

You are probably right that the terms mBTC etc. will gain wider usage but this change in terminology is more about the marketing, branding and public perception of Bitcoin.

Oh, ok, so this isn't the end of the world. It's just that other people wanting to sell today and make a profit before the price comes down can't really do it. This doesn't make a difference for people buying BTC on MTGox or people just storing USD or BTC with MTGox for trading in a few days/weeks from now, right?

Well pennies don't have much value at this point but at one time there was a useful distinction between a penny and a dollar. Pennies could have been used for small purchases like groceries and dollars could have been for larger monthly expenses. 
If the value of one bitcoin hits $10,000 or more there will be very few things that the average consumer would ever spend a "whole bitcoin" on other than a house, a car, or a trip to space. This would mean that the denomination "bitcoin" would be functionally useless outside of large business deals or major financial purchases.

And I could still gain access to the coins even if the computer with Armory was lost/stolen/broken/deleted as long as I had the private key written down or paper wallet printed out. Right?

Mathematically it doesn't matter. It matters semantically. It matters psychologically.

There is nothing to stop someone from brute force guessing the private key for a wallet address. The trouble is even if electricity is free and you had all of the computers in the world making the maximum number of guesses per second it would still take longer than the age of the universe to make a correct guess.

Yes, this. If bitcoin is widely adopted it will definitely disrupt the banking environment but bank-like institutions will still be useful. I see a world where:
1. Banks offer cold storage services using the lock-boxes that are already in place in most banks. For example, if you have a paper wallet you could keep the sheet of paper in a lockbox for safe keeping in case there is a fire/flood in your home. For security and protection against goverment seizure you could make a paper wallet that required m of n parts to recover and store the sections in the lock-boxes of friends or family. Alternatively you could have an encrypted paper wallet stored in the lock-box and maybe some reminder clues as to what the password is.
2. Banks will still have a role in making loans unless there are more services like Prosper filling that role. I am not sure how interest rates would work with a deflationary money system. Could someone comment on this?
3. Bank-like entities could act as the trusted third party in bitcoin transactions where funds are not released until a third party weighs in.

Ok, but I just want Armory to be a cold storage, 100% offline account where no BTC is ever transmitted out (at least not for a few months/years). Is it safe to send bitcoins to the receiving address Armory generated even though that computer and receiving address has never been connected to the network? I won't lose the bitcoins by sending them to  that address and watching them from Blockchain.info, right?
In other words, Bitcoin-QT isn't required to safely receive bitcoins (that I can later recover), is it?

It's not very good marketing for a currency if the average consumer can't afford a whole unit of the currency.

So the private key that Armory generated while offline when I created the wallet will still (at some later time) allow me to spend any bitcoins sent to the receiving address even though:
1. my copy of Armory has never been connected to the Internet
2. my private key has never been on a computer connected to the Internet
3. my public address has never been used in a copy of Bitcoin-QT
4. and the only time the public address has ever seen the Internet was when I told someone to send bitcoins there.
Is this all correct?

Of course nobody knows what will happen but my guess is that we will see a lot of Americans buying BTC and driving the price up. Over the Thanksgiving holiday there were probably lots of 25-35 year old sons telling their baby boomer parents about bitcoin for the first time. The parents with some extra money probably said "Ok, we'll invest $10,000 in that." Given Bitstamp and Coinbase verification times we could see a price rise by the end of the week.

You would have much better odds of stealing an encrypted wallet.dat file and making guesses as to the password encrypting the file and then using the revealed private key to move the BTC from the associated address. This is more practical because most people's encryption passwords are typically shorter than the private key. Still, guessing a decently long password could take many millions of years and you probably won't live long enough to spend the coins.

I have seen a few posts in this subreddit about a guy who will attempt to brute force guess your wallet.dat encryption password if you forget it. All you need to do is provide him with the wallet.dat file and a list of your possible passwords, password formats you usually use, favorite numbers, and some other information. Using this data he can make millions of "educated" guesses at your password. This narrows down the number of possible passwords to something that can be guessed in days, weeks or months.

Do I even need Bitcoin-QT when I am ready to spend the coins or move them to a new address? Can't I just import the private key or wallet file from Armory into my Blockchain.info account and make the transfer from there?

Can you explain why? What is the issue with MTGox?
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:23:32
But I won't need it until then, will I? If I just want to watch the bitcoins for a year or two I don't need to have Bitcoin-QT installed, do I? My question is: if Bitcoin-QT isn't installed when I send my bitcoins to the address generated by the offline Armory wallet will I still be able to spend the bitcoins in that wallet at some later time or have I sent them off into cyberspace with no hope of retrieval?

Does this mean the issue is fixed or that now something is really broken?
Can someone please explain the post for me? What is a "sell wall"? Wouldn't I want the price to be $10 lower if I am buying BTC?
Is MTGox shutting down? What if I just sent them some USD a few days ago and it is still pending on my account?
