One of these things is not like the other.  The first two criticisms were made by people who don't support Bitcoin and want to see it fail, but the third criticism is being made by by people who have supported Bitcoin from the very beginning and want to see it succeed.  We would be wise to listen.
@_date: 2016-04-16 02:17:36
I'm surprised your post wasn't censored for using the "S" word.
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:38:30
Agreed, but there are fundamental flaws with the way the subreddit is administrated.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:13:39
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:35:52
He must be, because activation of this soft fork was established at 95%. Anything lower is tantamount to moving the goal post for the sake of "winning".
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:53:45
Couldn't this same attack vector be used in off-chain transactions regardless of block size limiting?
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:33:30
How does the block size limit prevent this attack?
@_date: 2017-02-08 05:57:17
Describe one such attack vector?
@_date: 2016-03-05 19:04:01
I think the words you're looking for are "coercion," "misinformation," and "collusion."
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:03:11
Thanks I think I understand now. Is this correct? The vector always exists with off-chain transactions, but the attack can be better hidden if block sizes vary between different miners.
@_date: 2017-03-17 00:25:14
A lot of you are going way off the deep end here. Most people who want larger blocks don't follow any cult of personality and just want to restore the operating economic principles of Bitcoin. It's as ridiculous as saying that small blockers worship Gregory Maxwell.
@_date: 2016-03-13 10:00:06
Then we should really work out a plan to decentralize hashing power, because having a few miners responsible for the vast majority of mining is a highly centralized model. Until we find a way to decentralize mining, we should implement stopgap solutions for users to voice their preferences on protocol, so that they don't have to resort to voting via moving their money into alt-coins.  The current structure has recently given way to centralization through social engineering, and a small number of influential technocrats have begun to successfully govern the entire system.

Because    cen sors hip
@_date: 2016-03-13 10:03:16
It's more centralized these days than ever before.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:05:19
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:04:36
How naive of you. Why not visit the other sub and figure things out for yourself? That person was trying to help you.
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:32:36
Anybody who has ever taken the time to visit both subs knows full well which one is guilty of c en sors hip. The way I had to spell the "C" word should be enough of a clue.
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:44:21
Why would this comment be downvoted??
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:46:45
This implies you WOULD jump if they asked. Cute.
@_date: 2017-03-01 05:03:16
Your intuition is right, keep following it and investigating for yourself. In 2013-2015 I used to come exclusively to this sub, but when the c ens ors hip began here I felt betrayed and began visiting the other sub more and more.
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:28:08
You mean to say that slinging personal insults and chronic shitposting got you banned from a subreddit? Color me shocked!
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:53:56
Funny, I don't remember seeing you there at all. Back in 2013 I began frequenting this sub on a daily basis, but when the   c ens ors hip  began I migrated to the other sub just like nearly all other early adopters. Sounds like the opposite of what you're saying.
@_date: 2016-06-23 20:18:56
I got involved when the governance and hashing power were still decentralized.  It wasn't that long ago, but it was before decision making had been co-opted by an influential few in order to push the agenda of a fee market, and the community still had places where the merits of different ideas could be openly debated.  Back then it had the potential to disrupt world finance, and bring to the unbanked masses a fair shot at participating in the global economy.  I miss those days.  Nowadays I participate because I like trading on volatility, and because I still have a little bit of hope that its former promise can someday be restored (if governance and hashing centralization problems are overcome).
@_date: 2016-06-19 21:39:40
You're missing the point.  It doesn't matter if it's due an attack or genuine transactions, the network is being overwhelmed because it is capped at an arbitrary limit. The user experience suffers regardless of the motivation, and when the user experience decreases, consumers will move to product substitutes.
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:08:17
The amount of transactions required to congest the network increases, regardless of fees, and the attack vector becomes exponentially more difficult.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:37:56
Developer centralization might finally come to an end. Huzzah!
@_date: 2016-06-19 23:46:12
You're correct that the increase in difficulty is linear. The nature of the attack vector requires that an upper limit be reached in order to cause congestion, in other words, the attack vector itself relies on hitting this known upper bound or size cap.  Remove that upper bound, and you create a moving goal post for the attacker. To use a medieval analogy, it's like laying siege on walls which grow higher any time you lay your ladder against the side and start to climb (or walls that grow thicker when you start loading heavier stones into your trebuchet, etc.)
@_date: 2016-11-04 20:48:58
Even better would be to evaluate their arguments for yourself so that you might better understand their reasoning.  Try seeking out the reddit that is named after the Bitcoin ticker symbol. We are not allowed to say the name of it here, but it is a place where you can broaden your understanding by conversing with many of bitcoins earliest adopters. The community is very large, despite the low % of hash rate, so it is most definitely noteworthy.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:07:25
This is such a warped and sad view of Bitcoin's potential. 
@_date: 2016-12-20 06:15:33
You sound angry.
@_date: 2016-12-20 06:26:57
Not sure he what he's talking about. It actually just removes the block size limit of 1mb, which was only meant to be a temporary parameter.
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:52:50
Because it's okay to break the rules of this subreddit as long as you are reinforcing the anti-scaling echo chamber. It's a smear attack meant to make legetimate competing implementations look like a sideshow.
@_date: 2016-12-20 05:56:09
Businesses play a critical role in increasing adoption and creating new use-cases for the technology, which increases the value of the entire ecosystem. Bitcoin has many stakeholders, and developers symbiotically benefit by supporting the needs of stakeholders.
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:57:41
You flipped these around. /r/ Bitcoin forbids discussion about on-chain scaling (which is p2p cash), and promotes discussion of off-chain scaling such as lightning network (a 3rd party, layer-2 solution).
@_date: 2016-12-20 06:09:20
That transcript misquotes the actual interview. He says something more along the lines of "...hasn't listened to Bitcoin businesses enough...". Seriously, give it a listen before you continue to spread misinformation.
@_date: 2016-10-27 01:12:32
How would this apply to people who used to be on but chose to leave because of policies that forbid open discussion of dissenting ideas?  I would use the "c" word but I don't want my post to be shadow-filtered.
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:48:14
No, the total throughput will still be the same. This means that fees will just reach a higher equilibrium price and the same number of transactions will continue to be backlogged. The only solution is to scale the chain and increase capacity.
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:55:41
Thanks, I will give it a read through tonight.
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:09:11
The focus should be peer-to-peer currency as this is where the true potential of the technology lies. Second-layer (or settlement-layer) solutions are a secondary and lesser value proposition, but despite this they are currently being promoted at the expense of advancing the principle value proposition. (sorry for the previous ninja edit -- typing from a mobile device and accidentally hit submit)
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:38:01
That is my point, yes, and at present we can safely scale on-chain to meet present demand. After putting out the current fire we should shift our attention towards on-chain scaling to meet future demand (someday meet global demand, we hope!). I agree that off-chain p2p is feasible, but it reduces the p2p value prop significantly.
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:51:46
Thereby diminishing its chief and most principle value proposition of being a peer-to-peer currency. Second-layer solutions do not constitute scaling, because they offer a fundamentally different value proposition.
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:12:50
The P2P aspect will become meaningless if transactions become too expensive to justify its use as a currency. Would you still use cash if it required a 10% surcharge?
@_date: 2016-10-13 06:26:01
@_date: 2016-10-27 20:23:16
But then it's not p2p by nature, because it requires a 3rd party intermediary.
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:24:51
Glad to see we agree.  Constraining supply while increasing demand results in higher fees.  In this case the supply constraint is artificially imposed via a 1mb limit.
@_date: 2016-10-27 13:04:10
Increased bidding for a finite resource creates a higher equilibrium price.  Do you disagree?  You can plot this by looking at the rising transaction price if you need more evidence.
@_date: 2016-10-13 14:54:30
How can I do this, specifically?
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:50:24
@_date: 2016-10-27 21:46:26
Anyways, thanks for the discussion. It's been nice having an intelligent chat with someone given the current state of the community.
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:51:38
And less unnecessary complexity in the protocol.
@_date: 2016-10-27 14:23:57
TLDR version: we shouldn't scale bitcoin because it might become too useful and therefore too popular.
@_date: 2016-10-27 05:39:49
How would this apply to people who used to belong to but left after certain policies (which cannot be named) were implemented?
@_date: 2016-10-27 00:49:25
Because you are essentially in a bidding war with other users.
