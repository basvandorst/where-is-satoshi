Price goes up, price goes down. Can't explain that.

Good thing i'm still up on my original investment.....it's getting close though

Either something is wrong with coinbase or bitcoin has been stabilised for over an hour...

@_date: 2018-08-08 05:41:32
This is gonna sound braggish as hell and i'm sorry but wtf man the last few times i've had sex in the past couple weeks it ends with me checking coinbase on my phone afterward and seeing bitcoin  dropping hard
Fuck it had sex?
Maybe i'm about to go on a holy quest of abstinence for the next two years in honor of bitcoin. I'll do it for everyone guys. For the greater good
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:11:11
$1000 has been sitting in my gdax and coinbase pending and waiting to be deposited for 6 days now. Fuck I hope it doesn't bounce back too quickly for me to buy at a good cheap price.

@_date: 2018-06-14 17:21:13
We will see. It's a double edged sword for me in the super short term because I want these funds to deposit ASAP so I can buy in cheap but my mining profits have also been down the past week or so as well from the drop. 
Just hold off another day or 2, bulls.......
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:27:29
Yeah just HODL bro that sounds like too much stress
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:57:40
Coinbase app is fine
@_date: 2018-06-11 18:02:14
I've been mining with Nicehash for a few months now and making decent profits in bitcoin, and I was actually gonna buy about $900 worth of bitcoin to pad my holdings a few days ago when it was sitting at $7500. Glad I didn't. Gonna monitor how it does the next week or so to see if it drops even farther. Then I'll take advantage

Why did you even sell it at 9k haha
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:31:16
10,420 ��������
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:26:48
Please don't put more money into bitcoin than you can afford to lose. That money can be better spent on bills and necessities
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:40:09
I'm literally shaking. This can't be happening. My mom came in to my room and i literally slapped a plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand... Fuck i thought Bitcoin Cash was the future ������ i thought our savior Craig Satoshi was going to liberate us from oppression with his true vision of larger block sizes and a better world for all....this is so fucked. I'm gonna go all in on NANO

@_date: 2019-06-22 01:29:26
Well shit i should probably start mining more and gaming less
@_date: 2019-06-26 02:40:19
Thats fucking bitcoin right there.  None of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera with a suit on type bullshit.  Men puke, men poop in their computer chairs, men deliver their new born baby with a phone in their hand checking Coinbase.  Fucking hard core dick in the hand up til 5am fuck it chuck it game time shit.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:34:24
It's literally not 2011
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:59:04
Some people have to realize that when bitcoin jumps $2000 in a day, and then drops $1000, it's not a crash or anything to really be worried about. That's bitcoin folks

Rise up Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:37:00
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:06:36
Yeah exactly. Like I get it can be good practice in a way, but dude it's literally nothing to brag about at all. There are no actual gains if real capital isn't involved...
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:50:34
Bitcoin: 112% gain year to date
bTrash: 31.3% loss year to date
Simple maths folks. I rest my case.
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:47:22
Bitcoiners RISE UP
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:39:23
Down $2000, then back up $1000 in a flash. Damn
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:28:07
No offense but this kind of shit just blows my mind man
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:59:41
Not to be smug but lately I've been feeding a lot of crow to a good friend of mine who said "bitcoin is dead". A few months ago he tried to brag about all his stock market gains on an "investing app" which had no real capital on it. (Fake money������)
Even when Bitcoin was under $4000 i told him bitcoin could be worth $1 and it's still worth more than anything he does on a fake investing app
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:29:16
Yeah well it isn't 2011 anymore. He should focus on the present. There's no knowing what will really happen.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:47:27
You may be on to something...
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:30:43
Why sell at 9k?? I don't see the logic here
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:51:53
It's bouncing back nicely. Considering how much was sold this is a cakewalk, young grasshoppers among us
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:32:20
Or else what? You gonna make it crash brah
@_date: 2018-11-04 18:32:01

This is good for bitcoin

@_date: 2018-07-24 22:04:16
only first bought in at $6400 last month. Looks like i'm in for a wild ride 
@_date: 2018-07-24 05:47:18
8k cracked first time since late May
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:25:18
The last few months, I stopped checking the price of Bitcoin throughout the day and even stopped mining. The excitement is back boys! I've been in the green again since $6000 but still. This is a good sign.
