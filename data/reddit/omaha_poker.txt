I am so surprised Apple do not check this in detail? Are they not liable if people actually download from the official store?

BBC watchdog essentially says don't use Paypal. I also got my Paypal blocked after 13 years recently. Why do I have to conform to US banking regulations when I live in the UK?
@_date: 2016-04-08 00:36:01
Whoa! That is great to hear from the community and BTCC! Not many places you can lose over 5k and still get it given back to you.
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:14:33
How can it be illegal if the limit is 10K and you send 9990 several times? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:59:49
That is brutal. With all due respect, 10K isn't even that much money anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:38:48
I believe it is for unverified accounts.

I was in their office in HK a few weeks ago and asked the same question. The reason that they gave is that the cyber security is huge (and I'm talking government grade). It takes that long to get cleared.

4th reason, difficulty has gone up and crypto prices have dropped a bit. Why wants to pay 1800 usd for a dash miner that will not make an ROI?

Is bitcoin going to scale up before it comes unusable?

Sorry not enough to coffee my end! 
@_date: 2018-09-23 12:37:03
I know it does. Everything worked perfectly from LBC side of things. He got his bitcoin I got the money, yet he complained to his UK bank that a direct bank transfer was made without his consent. As a result I had my UK account flagged and frozen until I went back to the UK. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:09:26
I would never store coins on any phone. Ledger all the way.
@_date: 2018-09-13 05:37:40
True, but at least Samsung phones aren't as restrictive as Apples. Using a iPhone is like riding a bike with stabilisers. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 05:09:23
Had this for 3 months when I was out of the country about 6 months ago. I sold some BTC via bank transfer on local bitcoins and the new user on LBC told the bank he was scammed and didn't receive the coins/ his card was used without his permission. The money wasn't reversed but my account was frozen until I could provide the chats from LBC with the bank. Massive hassle when you are out of the country. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 05:15:50
Why not? Show me an ATM where you can withdraw 12'000USD in a single day.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:17:49
Some of us need the money now for whatever reasons. If I could hold longer I would but selling a BTC or two at this price is a considerable amount of money for me and paying my credit card off is a dream. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:17:35
Do people count the money when you pay for things?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:13:24
Every time I have sold before I have always regretted it. I'm holding.
@_date: 2018-09-07 05:11:16

You have yet to add Value added tax at 20 % yet....which puts it close to 950 usd.
@_date: 2015-12-06 01:13:18
Its actually not included like it normally is. Click buy a ticket and they add on VAT after and sadly yes it's 20%
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:12:36
I thought it was illegal to add a change for using a credit card to pay? 
Oops just in the UK sorry ROW 
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:44:21
But Bcash doesn't even do that so well. There are way cheaper fees with other coins and quicker block times.

Taking away more freedom and forcing you to use banks. As someone who is currently cut off from the UK banking system I fully understand why this is disgusting. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 07:07:18
I want bitcoin, I want it without handing over ID and I wanted it yesterday. Its hard to get bitcoin for the first time trying to use cash. Especially here in the Philippines where it's hard to do more than 50usd at a time in meet ups.

My colleague is from Venezuela and she sends a days wages to her family back home via Bitcoin. That supports a family of 4 for a month. The main issues are sending any money into the country. It is getting harder to do all the time. So it isn't just 2-3 dollars it is mostly support from family abroad.

Aren't these the guys who have just been caught cheating at blackjack?!
@_date: 2015-05-07 04:56:45
I tried this. By the time I bought bitcoin at X rate, sent it and he had converted it an hour or two later the loss was a lot more than the 14USD I get charged to wire money. Although it was much quicker...

Yep, use Expedia to book the car and then pay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:13:14
It did. Thank you for the help. I would just love to know how many Bitcoins have been lost forever so far!
@_date: 2015-05-07 16:15:12
They do but I like many trying to use bitcoin do not have the skills to use bitcoin that way. I tried to send 10K USd and it cost me way more than a bank transfer.

@_date: 2017-02-26 13:13:03
I agree not too much has has changed since 3 years ago? I think maybe the halving, more people being aware of Bitcoin and maybe some companies starting to adopt. 
Only recently have I really used it, mostly for remitting money from the Philippines back to the UK and now paying bills on coins.ph due to the ridiculous line ups at the banks etc.
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:09:28
Thank you Shatosi for your answer. You get the gold. Argghhh!

No worries. Shatosi answered this is a non condescending manner so he gets my gold for the day. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:14:34
Thank you Sir. And it's impossible to know how many of the Bitcoins mined so far can still be used? Ie. not lost. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:04:15
I have no idea what current rates are, but unlike real currencies they are not replaced. Great to see the Bitcoin community is as helpful as always when people who are new to Bitcoin try to ask serious questions....
@_date: 2016-01-15 09:20:53
It cost me about 1200 earlier but its looking like even more as of now :(
@_date: 2015-05-15 14:37:17
OK so essentially the longer that a coin has not been moved the more chance is that it has been "lost".
Thanks for the info. Really new at BTC and just trying to get my head around some of it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 03:00:18
Does it only apply to BBC though? Can I watch ITV programs or no live TV at all?

@_date: 2017-03-27 06:09:23
I work in Manila. Even the poorest of kids have smartphones, there are lots on the market that new only cost 150 USD. The internet is free at most malls and the 4G masts across the islands provides relatively cheap internet. The main issue is yes, lots of poor people don't have the correct ID needed to open a bank or that there are no banks in the most rural of areas (Palawan springs to mind).
@_date: 2017-03-04 05:26:48
Really? I was so harrassed I gave up and ended up paying. No idea why, I only ever watch the rugby highlights which frankly, are better on YouTube now anyway.
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:29:01
The issue is that I don't actually need the money right now.  I've come this far without selling and don't plan on selling now the price is far too low! 
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:49:05
Currently work in Manila and Union Bank are awesome towards Bitcoin and have a positive mindset. They have linked up with Coins.ph which offer Filippos the ability to not only buy bitcoin and remit for way less than the other alternatives but also pay bills online and and to get up to 10% back in rebates. 
The amount of time I have saved using these two services have been a lifeline as it can often take over an hour to remit money or waiting in lines at the bank to pay bills.
Excited for the continued support Bitcoin gets in the Philippines.
@_date: 2017-03-03 06:30:08
Where in the Philippines are you moving to?
@_date: 2019-11-18 05:10:30
Were you not tempted to give it all up and move abroad to an island and enjoy life?
Did they take cash/ assets as well as BTC?
Could have you split the BTC up and given just a hardware wallet?
Did your wife stick by you?
Do you family know about you selling?
Good luck in your future ventures!

"Around 15M Bitcoins have already been released." 
If you simply Googled this you could see the answer was over 16M. It's this simple lack of fact checking that makes me resent getting a mandatory TV license in the UK.

I played poker full time. In 2011 black Friday happened where the FBI illegally seized all funds associated with Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars. Despite it being totally legal to play poker from home in the UK. I had no job and looked at other options. Shortly after that Seals With Clubs Poker room opened and used Bitcoin to deposit with. Very very lucky to get in that early.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:49:58
Wow, thanks for the link! I wonder how many Bitcoin days were destroyed?!
@_date: 2017-01-16 07:18:13
Ah I was looking for those. Definitely my Bitcoin as I remember sending it on the 4th of October. I can't find the keys just now (moving back to Nigeria) and I think we packed the USB in the box to be shipped. They are definitely mine and I was just waiting for a kind soul like you to post on reddit alerting me to the issue. If you can send them asap then I can still help you get some of my unkles tied up millions. He was the Prince until he went to American for business and the FBI illegally stole him for themselves and put him in a prison because American doesn't have a prince and they want one. Oh and here is where the funds need to come back to thank you.  15JdKxYqFh8ZHkuW4sbuvbHpFToCGepgeT

I can't mention that the king died. It's too upsetting for me.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:19:33
What does everyone think? I know either way it will be a gamble. Should I instantly sell BCC as soon as the fork happens? I'd happily take the 20% BTC value that is it proposed or sell at a later date once/ if the price recovers and BCC doesn't die out completely? Or just hold for the future?
@_date: 2016-06-01 14:29:45
I don't and never said I did, they treat people like they are a bank and make people conform to US banking legislation from when all they are is a payment processor.

Would Apple be liable if you lost bitcoin in these apps?

The fee is 5% 
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:31:34
No.....I am just seriously wondering what the next scalability move is. There are a lot of signs of increasing adoption from what I have seen where I currently live and I am hoping that we don't see the explosion in fees like before. Surely it is better to prepare for the snow, before the snowstorm hits? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 02:31:08

My other half is American and we live abroad. She is taxed locally on her income here and also taxed on that back in America yet using virtually zero of the services back in America. We brought a house together and it was going to be such a burden for her to have the name on the property that we just put it in my name.

10% for eBay, 3% for PayPal. Not great when the items for sale are costing over 1200 GBP. Sorry but that's pretty much my profit margin. That's why most eBay sellers have moved to eBid and OpenBazzar or Facebook groups. 
@_date: 2018-06-26 06:19:36
Yes. I have used it a few times. You do have to show ID and transactions are that of at least 100 USD.

I use LBC in Manila. My main issue is that, the banking system absolutely sucks here. I often will have to wait an hour + to deposit money. In addition the banking hours clash with my working day and I can only use the banks in my lunch break. Over certain amounts the bank wants to know where you got the money from and in addition some types of deposits are charged. Banking in some parts of the world isn't effective enough to scrap cash.

Wake up re bank consumption! How much power and energy is needed to support all the banks, ATM's and money let alone the workers needed to keep the bank running. 
Sorry kid, running a business it doesn't work like that, you have to suck up the loss! There is no charge back when you are the business and have already sent the item.
Anyway I suggest you go back to your other favourite site (pornhub according to your post history) and take a long hard look at reality. Not too hard though apparent you say your close to suicide after waking over the bridge recently and also working for an amazing nano tech company, yet seem to spend a lot of time posting in gaming and porn subreddits...!!!! ������������������

Lol think before you write and your first line is "Because they can be used in real life!" Well Bitcoin is used in real life for many things. Hence it's value.
Xmas lights or anything? What about the amount of power and resources a typical bank takes to run. It's far far more than any crypto currency uses.
What bank charges a few cents per transaction? Show me. Because as a business user, every time I charge a customer with a MasterCard or Visa, the bank take their 3.1% fee. American express and some others take 5%!! PayPal take 3.2%! For doing very little they take a huge cut of profits. Conviently isn't the case, I am forced to accept chargebacks, accept losses when customers use stolen cards and change me monthly to store my cash as well as offering an interest rate that is less than Inflation so yearly I lose money with them!
I've never had a single charge back or fraudulent transaction with crypto.
If the existing system was so perfect then the crypto business wouldn't be able to exist and thrive!! No one really using crypto in Venezuela? Look at the volumes on LBC! That speaks for itself. A colleague, monthly remits bitcoin their as a lifeline for her family.
Clearly I'm speaking to some teenager from the USA with very little life experience, who's probably never left his own country and is super salty that he never brought into any crypto currency back on the day. 
I suggest you "think before you write!"

Personally I'm probably the "silent majority" (more like minority) I think that pretty soon with the mass adoption we will need 2mb blocks. I understand that there is space if people aren't spamming blocks but surely eventually 1mb blocks will have to give way to larger blocks eventually? 
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:31:28
What does have value? What gives gold value? What gives  grain value? It's what someone is prepared to pay for it. 
BTC, people verifying the transactions get paid and they get very little for it. Wasting electricity is very subjective. Is having Xmas lights up wasting electricity? It becomes a dangerous route to go down if you tell people what is wasteful, enjoyment or needed.
It's like Visa charging people 3% to verify transactions. Surely that is a waste of electricity. That doesn't feel right to me. It also doesn't feel right that a UK bank takes 6% when I remit my USD salary to the UK for running an automated computer system when. So I remit via BTC and generally make 1-3% instead. 
BTC and other cryptos are also a lifeline for people in Venezuela and Zimbabwe right now. What other option is there for those people that you can suggest?

I'm not flipping out. Bittrex have the right to charge what they want and as I customer I have the right to move my coins onto exchanges that have better value fees. I'm just making people aware that their fees are higher than average.
@_date: 2018-11-09 05:25:22
Yeah true. I was banned after sending money abroad to buy a house. The house fell through and I send the money back to the UK. The amounts were different after the awful exchange fees and suddenly there were lots of questions about where the money had come from. I told them it was the same cash I send before but no locked (couldn't move anything/ pay bills/ etc) for 3 months. And that is how I found Bitcoin.

Isn't punching him in the face pretty exactly how his supporters would love to see people reacting to him? I'm not sure two wrongs make a right.
It seems like he has more of a voice with the increased terrorist attacks and grooming scandals that are emerging from the UK? Or is it just that he seems to be in the media more at the moment?

Well my father is a farmer. I know how much sells for and I know our share. For milk alone we get 29 pence per liter and it sells way way higher than that in the supermarket. 
Our potatoes sell for about 230 gbp per tonne and the supermarkets sell a 1kg bag for about 1 gbp. All they have done is washed, sorted, packaged and delivered the potatoes and the price quadruples.

I know it is completely different depending where you are in the world regarding the price of booze and overheads etc.

@_date: 2018-11-05 10:30:20
OK true, but it isn't practical for everyone. 
In reality for me where I live not it is actually safer to keep my Bitcoin on Coinbase than to actually have it physically where I live. Houses get robbed here all the time, fires and flooding happens yearly and we are long overdue for an earthquake.

Actually, three other journalist were reporting outside the court too. Tommy was the only one to be arrested. Secondly, the information he was reporting on was already in the public domain.

The issue with Paypal is they require me to conform to US banking regulations even though I am based in the UK. They are an entity to themselves and after they required additional ID (passport wasn't sufficient apparently) I just stopped using them. Only issue is that I can't sell on eBay anymore without having a Paypal account.

All good. Like I said, I don't particularly like the guy, although I understand why he is getting popular in the UK. However, as someone who was also cut out of UK banking (for supposed money laundering) and also having my PayPal suspended and then ultimately closed, I hate that they have the power to cut personal finance at the flick of a switch.

In the UK bar my friend has, drink profit is way way more than 10%. Barrel of beer (88 UK pints) cost about 90 GBP. Beer prices are £3.30 a pint. Yes there are staff costs and other overheads but I think it's closer to 45% profit. 
Same with a liter bottle of spirits. Bottle cost about £20/25 per liter bottle. 25cl (Scotland and Wales 35cl) shot goes for £2-2.50 and there are 40 shots in a bottle. So again the profit on that is at least 50%.

Well if you are forced to use it because they will not accept any other alternative then it's an illegal monopoly. That's why some EU countries governments are have sued them over the issue. Tell me one other payment processor you are allowed to legally use on ebay? The only thing is cash on pick up.

So Paypal have sent out another price increase for UK customers. 
There are now 3 fees associated with sending money from your PayPal Balance (they are not even having to send the payment from a card!). So typically if I wanted to send 10 GBP pounds to a friend in Japan, I would lose 3.99GBP in the Personal Transaction Fee, another 0.34GBP as the Additional Personal Transaction Payment Fee and another 0.20GBP as a fixed fee. 
Your 10.00GBP has been reduced to 5.47GBP which is a fee of 45.3%!!!!!
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:46:39

As the son of a farmer we earn more to produce biofuel from OSR than other crops but the crops have to be still rotated to avoid a build up of 'Take All' the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici.
Germany only exports about 5% and Brazil imports around 3.5% of the world market. A lot of this is for cattle feed. The main reason people are going hungry (and it will get a lot worse in the future) is there is a huge amount of land getting taken out of production in Europe to build on for the continual growing population. Just on the edge of our farm, hundreds of acres have been built on in the last 10 years. Combine this with a poor harvest in the USA, drought in Europe and floods in Australia and the prices dramatically increase. Average Joe can afford the increase but the poorest people in the world (in your example from Brazil) can't and in some cases people die. 
The solution has to be to try and put the breaks on the human growth. 
TLDR: Growing Biofuel doesn't take that much food out of production compared to other factors.

Just went to City of Dreams to play poker and now on the ground floor there is a place to exchange Bitcoin. With so many visitors from China/ Korea and Japan and such issues moving money between countries, this looks like a great business decision. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:56:19
Exchanges are definitely beyond most newbies. Plus you lose money in about 3 ways to get your BTC back.
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:08:22
This is just what I was looking for! Thank you!

If you are new to Bitcoin, and use this site you will be misinformed. If you want to buy BTC, you will end up with BCH and if you send that to the wrong wallet then you will probably lose it all.
I have nothing against BCH but I do have issues with the way that the sites that they control are set up to confuse new users.

I don't use ebay anymore to sell as PayPal wanted an insane amount of personal information that I wasn't prepared to part with. There is a local Facebook group where I live to sell things which works well.

In 10 years time "If you bought 100USD of BTC in 2017 you would be sitting on 75M USD now"

Show me one alternative on ebay apart from paypal or cheque? Sorry but on eBay.co.uk it's an illegal monopoly.
@_date: 2016-05-31 23:06:54
All of which I can't use on eBay.co.uk.
Even the credit card option goes through PayPal, so if your credit card was linked to a blocked PayPal account (my account is blocked as I don't want to have to provide PP with another ID photo and even more bills linked to my address) then you can't even use the credit card option either!
@_date: 2017-05-15 23:27:52
Sorry to hear that. If you don't mind me asking, did you just forget about the coins being on there, or didn't see the value?
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:52:45
Is that legal?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:06:51
Does having coins on Coinbase count or would I not get both in the advent of a split?
@_date: 2016-10-04 02:25:15
This doesn't add up. Market rate is 610USD this second and you are buying at 633USD?
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:52:54
Same when I sold some during the argument a month ago when it dipped to like 1k. I literally hate myself.

I cannot explain my distain for Paypal. They have an illegal monopoly with eBay and make everyone conform to US banking legislation.

Like your Mum on me right now.

Anything that means I don't have to use ebay and paypal ever again will be amazing. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 12:27:33
To sell on eBay the company makes it compulsory that you offer PayPal which is criminal in my view.
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:40:42
Even if they have been physically smashed, the data can often be recovered, especially if there are 1000 BTC on there. Do you still have the drives?

With all due respect I don't know why people would buy into Ripple. It was heavily pre mined and the owners promise not to see the pre mined coins...
@_date: 2017-05-13 01:41:39
As opposed to running?
@_date: 2016-05-31 23:16:56
Because, eBay bought PayPal and then stopped every other payment option completely stopping every other competitor from getting a slice. 
If you start an online shop that only takes Bitcoin, no. However, to me if you own the online shop AND you owned Bitcoin (I know that's not possible) then to me, then it would be. 
I do see you argument though. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 07:01:04
To be fair I wish PayPal payments were blocked in the UK too. They created an illegal monopoly on eBay, make people conform to US banking legislation and are a law unto themselves. They held all the payments I had collected for a music festival and wouldn't release the funds for 6 months. Ultimately in order to stop us going bankrupt I had to re mortgage my house and borrow from my family. PayPal is the pits.

"Lightning speed. Lowest fee (total $1.50)" so for 50 BTC you are paying into a Paypal address, paying above market rates and then only charging 1.50USD for high Paypal fees??? My gran could work a better scam and she has been dead 5 years.

Already use this as work most of the year in Manila. It's amazing for paying bills from abroad or loading up on cell phone load when abroad. You can use 7/11 to load your account and it arrives by the time you are at the exit of the store.

Be careful. My friend had a local music concert and accepted PayPal. The money was on hold for almost 6 months after the event.
@_date: 2019-05-24 03:05:38
Why did you have to keep a rolling reserve with them? 
Is that the same for Visa/ Mastercard? 
I have no idea why so many people use PayPal. Tried closing my account but can't unless I upload more ID.
