coinbase is the biggest lie, and there is nothing in the previous two years.
until this year, coinbase began to return to do something slowly, which is a bitcoin company should have done firstly.
this is completely cart before the horse

I think that the volume is meaningless, the key is that you can trade any amount of bitcoins which you want on exchanges.
Even the 24h volume is only 79 btc, but if I can buy 790 btc on it and withdraw succeccfully, that is really a good exchange.
As how to do with the excess btc, this is a problem should be considered by exchanges, they always have a way to balance.
