You're not typing it in.  Your punching out the letters that are already engraved and then sliding them into the Cryptosteel storage device.  If you're using this to store your seed and you have to retype them in, the BIP32/39/44 wallet won't allow you to put in a misspelled word.
So even if you misspell a word when you put this into the Cryptosteel, you should be able to figure out the real word even if you have a bit of dyslexia.  Cryptosteel is meant to be a long term, safe storage device.
The 2048 wordlist for BIP39 wallets are on Github so you should be able to reasonably figure out any misspellings.
Here's the English wordlist:

I have both the Trezor and Ledger.  My only issue with the Trezor is that about half the time, it doesn't connect to the wallet.  I have to plug/unplug multiple times til it makes a connection.  My understanding is that it's a driver issue with the USB connection. 
When I got my Trezor, there was a second blue USB cable in it with a note that the original first black USB cable may not work.  Hmmmm.
When I got my Ledger Nano Duo (because I like backup), I wasn't as impressed at first.  You have to plug/unplug multiple times to flash/update/reseed the device.  There's no UI so it seems strange at first.
When you do put your seed back in (when the firmware is updated), you get a screen with the 24 slots and you type it in.  If you type the seeds in order, then a keylogger could get your seed.  Trezor has you input the seeds in random order (enter your sixth word, your twentieth word, etc.).
All that being said, when Coinkite announced the multisig with a Ledger device as a signature device, I saw the light.  I played around with a 2-of-2 signature solution with my Coinkite login as one signature and a Ledger Nano as the second signature.  Outstanding.
I took it one step further, I ordered the inexpensive Ledger HW1 Duo for about for $24 delivered.  I then instituted a 2-of-2 signature wallet in Coinkite with a Nano as one signature and the HW1 as the other.
So to be compromised, my Coinkite account needs to be hacked along with my 2FA, and both Ledger devices need to be compromised.  Getting duo for both means I can keep the backup device in a safety deposit box.  But yes, when you seed the 2nd device with the seed, your could be exposed when typing the seeds back in.  I just type them in not in order.
I am going to write all this up at some point and post but I think this is a great, secure solution.
Trezor: $119
Ledger Nano Duo: $50 through Overstock or Amazon
Ledger HW1 Duo: $25 direct.

Once you put your seeds in, then the front plate will swing over and you can secure it any number of ways.  There's a hole where you can put a small TSA lock or anything else to show if it's been tampered with perhaps a plastic fastener.

I was at Sundance this year and this was one of the big success stories.  I didn't get to see it but the crowd and critical reaction was very positive.  I believe they actually took a lower bid for the movie so that the producers have a much larger upside if this movie goes big.
It's good publicity nonetheless but I'll doubt they'll announce bitcoin numbers unless they're really, really good.

It's the same price in BTC than via Indiegogo.  The Indiegogo price (which is not clear) is the price without shipping, you have to add shipping to the order (a mistake when they setup the campaign).  However, they pay a commission to Indiegogo so if you pay in BTC, the Cryptosteel folks don't give that up to commission.  They will confirm with you directly that they've received payment.  The BTC link -  - includes shipping.  It's handled through Mycelium Gear.

I have been buying from Coinbase since December in increments of $600 to $1800.  I have bought roughly 25 btc over that time.  Yes, you do need to have your account verified with your checking account and a credit card.  That takes a few days.  And after you've made your first purchase, it takes 30 days for you to be "trusted" where you can immediately buy $1000 per week and immediately get your btc.  Their procedures are in place to satisfy the AML/KYC regulations that they have to comply with.
I have bought 25+ btc from them over that time period.  When my btc is delivered, I immediately transfer them to another wallet, mainly BIP38 created offline, some I've put into an offline electrum wallet, I keep a small amount on a blockchain wallet and I'm also trying out BitGo.  And I keep a small amount on Coinbase which I use for smaller transactions.
Coinbase is a reputable as they come and if you move your btc as soon as you get them, you are safe.  Do your own research.  Trust/don't trust what I've said.  You have to take the leap sometime.

FWIW, I went to a bitcoin panel last night and one opinion is that there are some upcoming EU regulations that may have been leaked so insiders have bought up btc to its present levels.

They claim they're already starting with some production.  They have $2700 in BTC in hand and when the campaign closes, it'll take a few days for Indiegogo to send them their cash (minus their fees of course).  But Wojtek just posted a video message saying they are getting started.  It looks like they can start with their plates right now and when this closes, they can start printing everything.
The campaign ends the third week in June and their timeline says shipping in July.  I wouldn't be surprised to see these shipping my early July.

I suggest working and playing with as many wallets as you can but I'm of the opnion, right here and now, that a two key hardware solution of a Ledger Nano and a Ledger HW1 + Coinkite is extremely secure and also relatively easy to use.
Honestly, when you get a Ledger Nano, it doesn't seem that impressive and you are constantly plugging and unplugging it to do updates.  I was put off at first.
However, once you understand how it works by actually doing it, it's a great solution.  Two Ledger Nano's and Two Ledger HW1's are less than a single Trezor (I buy the duos for backup and having keys in a different physical location).  In fact, you can do it with a Ledger Nano Duo, using each device as a different signature, for $50 through Amazon.  But wait, buy it through Purse.IO at 20% off and it's $40.  Pretty good.
Can't afford that?  By two HW1's from Ledger direct for about $20.
 
Then open a free starter Coinkite account, create a 2 of 2 multisig wallet, and your private keys are safe in your HW devices.
I got to this point by literally playing around with everything from paper wallets, BIP 38 wallets, Electrum, Armory, Blockchain, Bitgo, Mycelium, Mycelium Entropy, Breadwallet, Coinbase, Circle, Breadwallet, and Trezor.  I'll be putting up a site soon where I look at the wallets from a user perspective.
My experience with the two hardware devices on the market to date, Trezor is very sexy but I have had connection issues.  Ledger seems very simple BUT using it as a private multisig key in Coinkite makes it a superior solution.
There's the Case wallet coming out this summer.  Early indications are that I'm not going to like it but that's okay, I'll get one and find out for myself.

The wallet was originally created over a year ago, perhaps with 1.8.  What I can do is go back in and recreate the xpub key and see what syncs up.  What is strange is the change address is an even amount that roughly corresponds to the moving around of BTC I was doing for testing and to learn.  What I still don't understand is the different transactions that show up.  It is only on a few specific days that there is an issue.
@_date: 2015-05-16 06:00:57
I really like using Ledger as a multisig key.  In fact, I'm waiting for the HW1 to go with my Nano so I'll have a 2 of 2 hardware key solution through Coinkite.  Great solution.

If you're glancing at someone punching in a PIN at an ATM, you might get a general idea of what the PIN is.  But if the numbers are scrambled, they have to see the exact numbers.  Because it's scrambled, it's that much harder to remember especially if you do it quickly.
I've seen it in movies and TV where someone will use a blacklight on a keypad and see what 4 numbers have been pushed.  Just one more thing to make it harder on the bad guys.
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:20:35
Congrats.  You'll need to play around with it to get used to it but Ledger is a great solution with the following caveats.
(1)  Write down your 24 word key and keep it handy.  You'll need it occasionally when reflashing and updating the firmware on the device.  Keep it secure along with your security card.
(2) You'll need to get used to plugging and unplugging Ledger when you reflash the device.  There's no UI to tell you what's going on but it will come back to the state where you can put your seed back in and reset your PIN.  Be warned, that three bad PIN attempts will wipe the device and you'll have to reflash (and you reset the PIN).  This is a great security feature if you lose your Ledger.  You can always recreate your private key with a new Ledger (Nano or HW1) as long as you have your 24 word seed.
(3)  If you want someone to send you bitcoins, plug your Ledger in and click on the receive tab.  It'll display a QR code but also in the lower left hand corner is a "Send by Email" button where you can send someone your public address.
(4) If you buy through a bitcoin ATM machine, my experience is that you get the private key on your receipt and that's what you'll need to sweep into your wallet.  But Ledger doesn't support that, you'll have to use something else to sweep that address.
(5) Coinkite+Ledger is a fantastic solution.  You can setup a free starter account on Coinkite and create a 2-of-2 multisig solution.  Your Coinkite login is one key and your Ledger is your other key.  Your Ledger wallet is still completely separate.  The Coinkite founder has a YouTube video out telling you how to do it.  Here's instructions from their blog:  
(7) Be sure to setup 2FA with your Ledger device.  Download the Ledger app - it won't show any balances or allow you to do any transactions, it's simply for 2FA.  With your Ledger wallet open, click on settings and then hardware where you can add your smartphone as a paired device.  You'll open the Ledger app on your smartphone and then pair it with the QR code.
Good luck.

I last made transactions moving everything out of this wallet about 7 to 10 days ago.  About the same time, the domain was registered.  I'm assuming they picked transactions going on right about that time at random, but there was 0 left in my wallet.  Up until this point, I didn't know you could attach a note like that.

Call me cynical, but regulation exists to try and prevent humans from destroying themselves from their most potent characteristic: greed.  Decisions that people make for their own interests often conflict with needs and wants of others.  Regulations try and prevent outright fraud, destruction of the environment, and outright chaos.
However, those in power, while claiming regulation is for the greater good, get corrupted by those in power and those with money.  So regulation only creates a level playing field for those who write the regulation.
Cryptocurrencies cuts out the middleman, so to speak.  Money flows unfiltered.  It's both wonderful and scary.  It has the power to do great good for those underserved and poor but it can be used for the most nefarious of purposes.  If we only had something that was like that?  Oh, right, we have the internet.
Those playing by the rules of regulation like Coinbase and Circle are paving the way for the rest (like AOL and Compuserve back in the day).  Many of us see the potential of tomorrow but can't predict what will happen the rest of today.

I got my Nano about a month ago.  I'll have to admit, I was a little put off by the plugging/unplugging of the USB device to initially seed and subsequently reflash/update the device.  But now I understand and am comfortable with it.  When the Coinkite/Ledger solution was announced, I implemented it and it was my big A-HA moment with multisig and seeing it done correctly.  
I now have an HW1 on order and will use it as a 2nd sig in a 2-of-2 private key on HW through Coinkite solution.  For those of you considering it, I'd recommend getting the duo Nano and duo HW1 for redundancy and backup.  That's still less than a single TREZOR.
Also, the Ledger devices are PIN protected and will lock up after 3 incorrect attempts and then must be reflashed so that's another significant hurdle to get over to get your bitcoin.
I'm working on a website where I'll demonstrate this solution.  Just a little way to give back to everything I've learned from all of you.

I have a problem with my electrum wallet.  I've created it on an air gapped machine and have watch only addresses on my laptop and desktop.  However, both watch only show different amounts.
On specific days, the transactions do not match up.  One will have a single transaction while the other will show multiple transactions and roughly the same output.
The net difference is that one of the watch only wallets shows a change address with some bitcoin in it while the other does not show this change address at all and that is the difference in the amount.  Any ideas?

I've watched a little bit of Turn on AMC which is about spies during the Revolutionary war.  It dramatizes early attempts at cryptography and codes.  It inspired a couple of crazy ideas.
The most important rule is never, NEVER write down your seed digitally.  Always assume that your computer is compromised and every keystroke is logged.
With that in mind, get one of those small Moleskine notebooks.  Pick a page somewhere and write down your 12 word seed.  Or better yet, put the seed on the same place on 12 consecutive pages.  Make sure you know how to remember the first word of the seed and the position on the page.  Then fill up as many pages as you want with random words.
Thus if your notebook is lost or compromised and someone thinks they have your seed, they'll have to be incredibly lucky to know what your real seed is.  I think most hackers would give up after awhile or wouldn't have the patience to type in every single word in your notebook and then try and brute force your seed.  Plus they would have to have a pretty fair degree of sophistication to figure it out.  Not a perfect solution but I think it's a formidable roadblock.
I have watch only wallets for my online Electrum and have used several different ways to sign my transactions offline.  I have been playing around with the Raspberry Pi and I like it as an offline signing device for several reasons.  First off, I only boot it up without the wifi dongle so it is airgapped.  Second, I remove the microSD card and keep it in a safe place when I'm not signing anything.
I've found several locations on the web that explain how to create an offline, airgapped Raspberry Pi electrum machine.  It's been done before.
I don't know linux and I've spent several hours figuring Raspian and the Pi out but for me, it's an investment in securing my bitcoin and I think it's certainly worth a little bit of effort.

I can confirm you can buy Shell Gas cards (or BP) with GameStop GC's.  Til the end of August, you get 5% back on Bitcoin purchases in Gyft.  I buy through Coinbase/Circle at 1%.  Buy $25 GameStop GC through Gyft, go directly to GameStop and buy a $25 Shell GC (I've only seen it in $25 denominations).  For some weird reason, they sell BP GC's in $50 denominations.
If that works for you to get an immediate 4% off, then go to PurseIO and start buying GameStop GC's for 24% off or so.  With PurseIO and Coinbase/Circle fees, your net is about 20% off of gas.  Even a 21% purchase of a GameStop GC through PurseIO gets you a net 17% off of gas.
GameStop has a gift card rack usually in front of the cash register.  They also sell Burger King, Subway, etc, anything they think a gamer may want.  It works.
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:27:58
So did I but I've done 25+ transactions with no issues whatsoever.  I've had items bought for me then cancelled by PurseIO after several days, maybe through their fraud detection.  I've had people buy things and then plead to have their bitcoin released early which is usually fraud.  All you have to do is ask for a tracking number (which is only known by the sender), and that usually chases the fraudsters away.
With the GameStop cards, exchanging for Shell or BP cards immediately breaks any direct link with Amazon so those can't be rescinded.  PurseIO does claim a $10k guarantee if there are any legal issues.  I've talked with Andrew at PurseIO and he's confident they've got a pretty good fraud detection model in place now.
It's up too you as to the risk you want to assume but I'm okay with what I'm doing and how I'm doing it.  
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:23:56
Communicate with PurseIO on this.  They have a $10k guarantee to help you out if you're a victim of this.  They had the bad incident in Germany last year that's been posted and documented.  But they learned and figured out how to tighten up their own fraud detection measures.  They've made claims, without offering any proof, they've had 4 other cases in over 10,000 transactions since then that they've resolved successfully.
If it's too risky for you, then don't do it.  I've been successful so far in over 20 transactions (I know, small sample size) but for me the benefit outweigh the risks.  Your choice.
@_date: 2015-08-20 03:08:18
For those still following this thread, I did a quick experiment.  For the rest of August, Gyft is giving 5% back on Bitcoin purchases.  I purchased a GameStop GC for $25 with 5% back, marched into my nearby GameStop and immediately purchased a $25 Shell GC with the GameStop GC on my Gyft.  So yes, 1% fee buying from Coinbase, 5% back from Gyft, so for a quick purchase I saved myself 4% off on gas.  Still a win in my book.
I've got my GameStop GC orders now up on PurseIO.

I'm under no illusions about the risk and this is something that I thought about quite a bit before taking the plunge.  People should do their due diligence on both sides and then they can make their appropriate decision based upon benefits/risks.
I've had multiple different buyers for my GC's, I receive them, I make sure they have value, and I occasionally recheck them.  Even if I have one deactivated (which I haven't yet), I'm still ahead.  The PurseIO model will either work or it won't.  It won't if there is widespread fraud that eventually gets down to its users.
I've had people attempt to get me to release escrow before I've received a shipment in an obvious fraud attempt.  Didn't work.  I've had people order for me but several days later, PurseIO will cancel the transaction due to their fraud detection or people don't purchase.
If this scares you too much, don't do it.  If you're curious, make some small sells on PurseIO (under $25).  In fact, your first buy, if it's not instant, they'll only let you do 8% so you'll have a successful transaction.  Before this, new users would try for some huge discount of 30% + but never get any buyers, get frustrated and leave the service.
Those naysayers out there, fine, continue to voice your objections and don't use the service.  But that's less competition for me as I put items up to be bought.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:15:43
The discount comes from the price you set on PurseIO.  You can ask for a discount from 5% to 50%, but someone has to buy that item for you.  For non gift card items, I've gotten as much as 35% off for books or other small dollar items (under $25).
However, you cannot use Amazon Gift Cards to buy other Gift Cards, you can use Amazon credit (which is a different market) so GC's do not come with such a deep discount.  Therefore, when you place an order on PurseIO, deeper discounted items will take much longer, if ever, to find a buyer.  On the other hand, I think if you offer up an 18% to 20% premium for a gift card, you'll find a buyer within a few hours.
If you have patience, the 25% is possible but it may take a week or so for someone to buy it.  With PurseIO fees (for argument's sake, let's say it's 2% but it's a sliding scale and they take a bigger fee for a bigger discount), the a 25% discount really ends up around 23% give or take.
When I first looked at PurseIO, I thought it was crazy and didn't make any sense.  But I've completed over 20 transactions and my SW GC's have all been good so far.  I fly a lot on SW so it makes sense to me to stockpile and have a fair amount at my disposal because I know I'll need it.
What the OP has discovered which is great is that GameStop sells Shell GC's (as well as BP) so you can take a GameStop GC and buy a Shell GC.  So you have to sign up for PurseIO, specify the discount you want for a GameStop GC, receive the GameStop GC, go to GameStop, and buy the Shell GC.

Sure, Southwest does not charge change fees so if you have to cancel a flight, you get a credit returned to your account that is good for 12 months from when you originally booked the flight.  While other airlines will charge you $50 or take your non refundable flight, with Southwest it is script.
The trick is to bankroll as many SW GC's as you need to make a trip and it takes time if you want to maximize the discount.  Also, these need to be physical GC's and not virtual.  The denominations are $50, $100, and $200.  I didn't get much luck at all with $50 but constantly turn over $100 about once a week.
While everyone wants to claim 25% off, with fees and timing, I'm getting 21% to 22% bought within 48 hours or so.  At 25%, I've had no action for a week.  At 21% and with PurseIO fees, the actual discount is $18.92 on a $100 GC.  While you can try and finesse and wait for a larger discount, 19% off my SW airfare is fantastic by any stretch of the imagination.
The SW GC's have no expiration date.  They are 16 digit codes with a scratch off to reveal the 4 digit PIN.  My understanding is that once issued, they can't be revoked but others have chimed in and said that six weeks is where it's permanent.  I did talk to the PurseIO guy at a conference and he said they stand by their guarantee.  I haven't gotten taken yet and this is the first value proposition I can concretely point to as why someone should use Bitcoin for purely selfish reasons.
BTW, Amazon also offers American Airlines GC's but I don't fly them at all.

The Shell and BP GC's at GameStop only come in $25 increments.  In the past when I've had $10 Shell GC, they can only process one at a time so it's a pain in the ass.
Like I just posted, if you want to try this out on a small scale, the rest of August, Gyft is giving you 5% back on BTC purchases so you can buy a $25 GameStop GC immediately, go to GameStop and buy a $25 Shell (or BP) card.  Worked like a charm, no big deal to the clerk.  With 1% to Coinbase to buy, I've just saved 4%.  Still worth the hassle.  I'm now going to scale up my GameStop GC buying through PurseIO and I'll be happy after fees and such to get a net 17% off of gas.  Well worth it.

Not sure if I understand your question but the liquidity of the Amazon GC market is what created the PurseIO marketplace.  Amazon sells GameStop GC's and then realized you can buy gas GC's (Shell and BP) at GameStop physical locations using physical GameStop GC's.  That's how it works.
@_date: 2015-08-19 05:40:47
There is a huge economy based around Amazon credits, if you can believe it.  I wasn't aware of it til PurseIO came around but some parts of the world get paid in Amazon credits and it costs them 30% to convert it into fiat.  And it takes time and can be rife with fraud.
If you look at the Amazon Annual Report (and I have), they list $1.7 BILLION dollars on their balance sheet as unrealized income as Gift Cards.  That was up $400 Million over the previous year.  That actually kind of hurts their balance sheet so they are kind of looking the other way at what PurseIO does.  It's beneficial that those unaccrued expenses come off the books.
I've had items bought in the middle of the night which seems to indicate someone halfway across the world is buying items for me to get my BTC.
One word of advice, the first time you sell through PurseIO, they make you offer only an 8% discount.  That's because people would put up huge discounts and then get disappointed when it would never get picked up and leave the service.  Make a small transaction of $25 or so at 8%.  Once you are successful, then you can name your own discount.  Good luck.

My understanding is that the Google Authenticator manual codes can be printed off from a hacked Gmail account therefore compromising your 2FA.  Anything that can be done with Authenticator can also be done with Authy which is what I prefer.
So if you used Google Authenticator as your 2FA for Bitfinex, and you did not use 2FA for your Gmail, then you were compromised as such.  However had you used Authy as your 2FA, then even if they compromised your GMail, they would also need to hack your Authy which means they would physically need to have your smartphone for the hack.
Oh, and Authy has PIN protection as an app.  So obviously you wouldn't use your phone PIN as your Authy application PIN.

Coinbase/Circle is great getting started, especially for the newbie.  Enable 2FA and use a hardened password.  Circle does require 2FA to reconfirm a send.  Coinbase has API interfaces with Gyft and PurseIO which makes it easy to use those apps.  Coinbase/Circle are perfectly reasonable services for obtaining and spending small amounts of Bitcoin and that assuming your mother is not going to gamble, buy drugs, become a MSB or buy a Backpage ad.  As long as you're not doing anything nefarious, then that's fine.
After that, a wide range of options which is great.  I prefer Ledger over Trezor but both are fine.  Ledger is cheaper, you can buy a Ledger Nano Duo through Overstock for $50 or you can have some fun and get a Duo through PurseIO.  I pulled one off with a 35% discount in early June and I received it shipped to my address for $39.14.  That way you can give her one Nano and you can keep the other as her backup.
You're thinking is absolutely correct.  Coinbase is very important for the vast majority of people who don't care about anonymity and just want to be part of the fun.  They don't care about private keys and security and should trust a company like Coinbase to handle everything. 
Good luck.

I accept responsibility.  No one forced to make trades at 15%.  Perhaps I'm a bit too altruistic and for BTC adoption to occur it needs to get out to people who are forced to use it.  This was for the experience and the ability to tell stories of how you can get Bitcoin.
And I've been referenced as a "libertard" elsewhere in this thread.  I have no problem being mocked.  But I absolutely believe that we have to get BTC out there and this was a great, real world situation where we can make it work.  I knew there was some risk, it happened, I lost.  I have "some" expertise.  But Paxful made claims about their system, I did "some" due diligence, and I took them at their word.  You can read what he's posted over the past few weeks.  You can decide on intent, claims and truthful/half truth statements about how Paxful works.
So then the opposite situation occurs where there's a need but no one will take a chance to try and truly help this potential large customer base.  I took the chance, I lost, I don't regret it.  I'm still pissed I lost somewhere under $300.  Everyone else sits on the sidelines, criticizes, make pithy comments and occasionally does someone suggest reasonable solutions.
I will sum up my feelings about Ray and Paxful at a later date.  I've laid out my narrative, you can see how he's responded, you can go back and see his original statements.  I can use help in doing the cyber forensics but the email used will end up being a dead end unless I can get more detailed IP address information from Paxful which I've asked for.

Hate to rain on the parade, but there is a huge risk you assume with bitcoin.  You are responsible for your own security.  Lose your keys, lose your bitcoin.  Trust your keys to a third party, the third party goes under or absconds, lose your bitcoin.

The whole way of getting smart contracts to work is an oracle, which is still a concept I have a tough time figuring out.  The oracle is what validates the condition that the contract has been fulfilled or not fulfilled.  But an oracle can be corrupted, right, just like anything else?
So you have a group of oracles that would arrive at consensus that a smart contract has been fulfilled.  The oracles are compensated for making the "right" decision.  Again, I don't know what is considered right and wrong.  But the oracles are compensated for voting in the correct way, thus they have financial incentive to be part of the ecosystem.
This was all verbally explained to me and I still have a tough time getting my head around it but oracles are kind of like miners and they need to be compensated somehow for rendering judgement.

Yes, being completely paranoid, having a clean secure PC to setup would be ideal.  Ledger does run in a Chrome browser extension.  You could boot up a laptop in linux and run Chrome to initialize your device.  But I don't consider that such a significant risk to completely dismiss Ledger.
Trezor also runs in a Chrome browser extension.  When you initialize that device, I believe you are asked to retype in the seed to confirm so again, you can be exposed to keylogging.  You can passphrase protect the device but that has to be typed in so again . . . keylogging.
The weakness of both Trezor and Ledger are the same to me: writing down and securing the twenty four word seed and not losing it.  After you seed the device, theoretically either can be used on a compromised computer.
The difference between the Nano and HW1 is completely cosmetic.
Oh, one more thing to consider, you can implement 2FA with your Ledger devices so there's that.  So even if someone steals your device and your PIN, they would also need your smartphone or security card (another roadblock) to authenticate.
It's apples and oranges.  If you can afford it, buy both and use one as primary.  The difficulty of cracking a 2-of-2 Ledger hardware signature with Coinkite as the interface is so remarkably hard that a hacker will find someone else to steal from rather than spend an enormous amount of time and effort to get mine.
Do your due diligence.  You have anonymous people on a message board giving you opinions so take it for what it's worth.  Good luck.

These are great ideas but I'm specifically looking for someone that has experience with integrating with a POS system.  For merchants to  want to accept BTC, especially restaurants and bars that multiple locations, it needs to link into their legacy systems.
With Coinbase/Bitpay, they will make that exchange at the EOD for the 1% (or for new accounts they waive that fee).  I'm talking about a waitress who serves a table, someone offers up a credit card as a guarantee.  At the end of the night, she brings the bill and you can pay in BTC (like cash).  She accepts payment and then she can close out the tab.
This must work with existing systems somehow otherwise it's too difficult for an owner that's not into bitcoin to accept.
Much easier for single owners/proprietors to accept payment into an individual wallet.
I'm hoping someone can chime in that has experience with implementing Bitcoin into POS, specifically this legacy restaurant management system.

I've recovered my twenty four word seed generated by my Trezor seed on my Ledger and vice-versa.  In fact, if you have your twenty four word seed and you're absolutely sure, you should wipe your devices on purpose and recover so you know the procedure.
One thing I really, really like about the Trezor recovery is that it prompts you for your seed words but not in order.  Therefore a keylogger doesn't know the exact order.  Even if you gave me all twenty four words but not in order, It is still massively difficult for me to hack you.  The odds of me randomly guessing your seed is 1/24! or 1/2e27 
Also, since it's working from the BIP39 2048 word list, you can't misspell a seed word.  For example "there" is a vaild seed word but "their" is not.

Actually the two seed words would need to be in order so that number would double.

I have Ledger and Trezor with Case on the way.   I like Ledger for multisig w/Coinkite.  I have some trouble with my Trezor not communicating with my PC sometimes.  But it's still okay.
Trezor looks good and you can show it to your friends.  Ledger doesn't have as nice a UI but if you can get past that, it's fine.
With Trezor, if you start putting in bad PINs, the time increases before you can try again.  Trezor website claims that between the 19th and 20th try, it takes a week.
With Ledger if you try three bad PIN attempts, the devices wipes clean and you have to reseed it.
The one thing I like about Trezor over Ledger is that the PIN keypad is scrambled on the device.  Also, when you reseed your Trezor your are prompted to put in your seeds not in sequential order.  Enter seed three, enter seed fifteen, enter seed six, etc.  That's a pretty nice security feature if you're being keylogged.  Ledger simply presents the spaces and by habit, you would type them in sequentially.  You could confuse a keylogger by putting the seeds in randomly.
Trezor $119
Ledger Nano Duo (two devices for backup) $59.99
Ledger HW1 Duo (two devices for backup) $24 direct from Ledger
Case Wallet $199 (not shipping yet)
Pro tips:
Ledger Nano Duo through Overstock:  $49.
Ledger Nano Duo ordering through PurseIO with 35% discount: $39.14 (pulled this off on 6/19)
You should be able to find a Trezor promo code somewhere and knock off at least $20.
Fun stuff to do:  Since both are BIP39 and use the same word list, I've recovered my Ledger on my Trezor and vice versa.
My number one solution is using a Ledger Nano and a Ledger HW1 as a 2-of-2 multisig solution through Coinkite.  You can still use these devices as wallets but for extra secure storage, each is an individual hardware signature device.  I don't use Coinkite login as a signature but as a way to create and access a multisig wallet.
Good luck.

My issues with Trezor have always been with the USB connection.  I would have to plug/unplug constantly until it connected.  Don't know about the scrambled mess.  Their support should help but they are in Europe and timing would be an issue if you're in the US

Only alpha.blockchain.info uses BIP39 which I guess is still in beta.  I tested it but prefer other wallets.  I've moved my BTC off the legacy blockchain.info wallet long ago.

A Higgs Boson particle walks into a church.
The priest says, "You can't be in here"
The particle says, "What are you talking about?  Without me, there would be no mass."

So Circle says it'll extend after their server crashes.  I finally get in and authenticate and then scan the QR Code and now it's expired?  Boooooooo.

"BitWhisper is a demonstration for a covert bi-directional communication channel between two close by air-gapped computers communicating via heat. The method allows bridging the air-gap between the two physically adjacent and compromised computers using their heat emissions and built-in thermal sensors to communicate."

This was valuable to me for the step by step instructions on downloading Ubuntu to a USB and setting up Electrum and a BIP38 wallet.  Sure you can search and figure it out but having it there was well worth the $3 I ended up tipping Aaron for it.
