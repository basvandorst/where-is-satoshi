**Title:** Security
**Transcript:** A Crypto nerd's imagination:
Guy [[Holding Laptop]]: His laptop's encrypted. Let's build a million-dollar cluster to crack it.
Other guy: No good! It's 4096-bit RSA!
Guy: Blast! Our evil plan is foiled!
What would actually happen:
Guy [[Holding money tag and wrench]]: His laptop's encrypted. Drug him and hit him with this $5 wrench until he tells us the password.
Other guy [[taking the wrench]]: Got it.
**Title-text:** Actual actual reality: nobody cares about his secrets.  (Also, I would be hard-pressed to find that wrench for $5.)

**Title:** Cryogenics
**Transcript:** [[Two people, one of which is staring at a smartphone]]
Person 1: Everyone's carrying sensor-packed, always-connected computers everywhere.  That wasn't true ten years ago.
White Hat Guy: It's all changing too fast, huh?
Person 1: No, too *slowly*.
Person 1: There's so much potential here.  These clumsy, poorly-designed toys are *nothing* compared to what lies ahead.
[[Person 1 climbs into a cryogenic chamber]]
Person 1: That's why I've worked to develop cryogenic freezing.  I'm gonna skip forward 30 years and use this stuff when it's *good*.
30 years later..
Someone who isn't Terry: Welcome to the future! Nothing's changed.
Person 1: What? Why??
[[rows of other people waking up out of their own cryogenic chambers]]
not Terry: When cryogenic freezing was invented, all the engineers who were excited about the future froze themselves. So there's been no one building anything new.
not Terry: But they're all waking up now!
Person 1: Sweet! I'm gonna jump forward to see what they do!
Engineer 1: Me too!
Engineer 2: Wait, uh, guys?
**Title-text:** 'Welcome to the future! Nothing's changed.' was the slogan of my astonishingly short-lived tech startup.
