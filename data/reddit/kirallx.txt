It's why Jewish buy a lot of gold, they know this system will explode and we'll return to gold time, so they'll be the richest again and always

Guys it's only my thoughts, I don't say it's for sure, it's just my opinion

New big player in bitcoin want just to take their profit
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:44:34
I don't think Bitcoin will crash 80-70% like you said, because Bitcoin changed, it's not Bitcoin you knew before, people's mindset isn't like 5-4-3 years ago, everybody just wait for a 10-15% dip to buy and make profit, with all the newcomers, they'll stop the dip everytime. 
Just look at 11/02/2017 mini crash, it went from ~7350 to ~6700 in less than 10 minutes, one day after, we recorded a new ATH.
According to me, the only thing which will cause Bitcoin to crash is USA or EU ban bitcoins or a fail in the bitcoin security.
Think about it ...

He seems legit; he is not new and he has a good reputation. I made a lot of transactions in localbitcoin it's very rare you meet some one with fake bills
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:36:17
Yes sounds good but be careful too with fake bills and bad guys always choose public places 
@_date: 2017-09-09 13:38:25
I see many post saying it's fake, huobi and okcoin announcement .

When you forbid something, you'll get the opposite what you wanted, people will be attracted by this "interdict".
Great advertising !

I have to admit that I didn't made yet day trading with kraken just bought and hold, so maybe in this point I'm wrong, but with deposit, withdraw and basic functionalies I never had problem with them and they look professionnal
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:13:33
Hi, you should try Kraken. The fees are correct.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:25:32
No they're not clown but professionnal, I used them for long time now I never had problems with them, just this time they take too much time to scale with the high demand and it's annoying.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:51:44
Yes i'll thanks 
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:46:21
Not yet but When I see all the complain about deposit delay I'm almost sure that the problem don't come from my bank but kraken, but I'll check it today for sure
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:23:49
My deposit is a SEPA too from France
