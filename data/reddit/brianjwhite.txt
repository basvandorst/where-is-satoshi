That's a single exchange saying they won't offer the product.

Sorry, I have my IRA through Scottrade.  So far its work well.

The total supply of bitcoin is 21 million.   
The total supply of US dollars is not limited.  The fed can print as many US dollars as it wants.
1 bitcoin today is 1/21000000 of all bitcoin.  That will hold true forever.
With the US dollar and other fiat currencies the supply is not fixed.  Every time the supply is increased, the ones you have are worth less.

I wonder if it crashed from real demand or millions of hodlers all trying to watch what happens.

There are 2^160 private keys.  You could generate 1000 per second for 1000 years and not even come across an address that has been used, let alone holds coin.
On the flip side you could generate the private key from the genesis block on your first try, but the odds of that are 1/(2^160)
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:49:43
Pretty bullish.  Only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:43:17
As far as futures goes it means that there will be an indicator for the direction "people" think the price is headed.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:18:29
Changetip was probably the best of them.  They were bought and shut down.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:46:40
These contracts are 100% derivative.  No btc is bought sold or transferred in connection with the contract.  
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:10:43
The number of "consumers" who trade futures....I don't know but I bet it's pretty low.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:33:56


Why do you say that?
From the gbtc site




Why would a hedge fund be trying to get our shares when they can buy directly without the premium?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:14:38
Thanks!  I didn't even realize.  Man 10 years...crazy how fast the time goes.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:54:39
You are missing the point.  An institution can buy gbtc around 1700.  They don't have to pay the market premium.  
I am not saying there isn't some entity trying to drive the price down.  I just disagree with your premise that it's hedge funds.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:08:39
Bch, LTC, eth, zec...the list goes on

True that the accounts are the same.  However, in the US a few states can use coinbase but not gdax.


@_date: 2017-12-09 15:13:10
Ahhh thanks, I think I get it now.  So if btc traders see the futures price falling they may be more likely to sell, driving the price down further.  
Conversely if they see the futures price rise, they may be more likely to hodl, driving the price up.  Coupled with  FOMO kicking for anyone on the sidelines.
I better go invest in popcorn futures because we going to need a whole bunch!
Glad I am playing with house money at this point.  I can sit back and enjoy the show.

You could buy GBTC in your IRA.  Still has risks (btc may go down), you pay a premium for GBTC.  
However, since its inside the safety of your IRA you don't have to worry about paying back losses if they were to happen.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:10:28
As a learning experience you could do it.  You will not make anything.
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:54:46
Yeah I am still trying to wrap my head around this futures thing. 
Aren't these contracts are really just bets for or against the price, and more specifically this first batch will expire on the 17th of January.  So it's a bet on the price on January 17th.
Other than more awareness (which tends to be a good thing) how does it impact btc in the real world?
If the btc price swings 20% which can  happen, futures trading stops for the day but btc still trades.  So that would just lock anyone who owns the contract in till trading resumes?
I have yet to seen which exchanges will be used to determine the price.  Although I haven't looked very hard.
Edit:  found the answer for Cboe futures.  Gemini is the exchange that will determine the price.


CME will use their BRR (Bitcoin Reference Rate)
More info on BRR

Where did you read that?

That sounds like it would be a huge burden lifted.  Question for you, as I have recently been having this conversation with the wife.  Do you sell it all to pay off the loan?  Once the loan is paid off do you start investing in crypto again?
Hypothetically speaking if your mortgage is 300k and you spend 2k a month on principle and interest, paying that off in full would be amazing.  But in the current market crypto is going up a whole lot faster than the 4% or so interest on a loan.  The odds of ever having as much crypto are pretty small.
On the flipside, If you pay off the debt, then if the market tanks you have at least paid off that huge debt.  And it's still early in terms of crypto adoption.

When I graduated from college with a CS degree my grandfather was asking me questions.  What do you do?  He would ask.  I would tell him about programming a website to automate inventory or sell widgets.  He would say, but we can already order inventory and sell parts just fine.  
I just shrugged and said yes I suppose you can.  He has since passed but the thing that has a stuck with me is that even the smartest and best of us can sometimes become skeptical and stuck in our ways.  
If I could go back in time I would have tried a different approach, but at then end of the day not everyone will get it.

How much of their wealth do you think those people hold in cash?  I would be will to bet it's mostly in the form of assets.  
Not saying there isn't room in the portfolio for crypto but I think you are overstating the threat a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:58:51
The rest if anyone is interested 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:55:36
It's called dollar cost averaging.  It can be an effective strategy for long term investing.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:27:45
1/(2 ^ 160) = 6.8422777e-49
So I am saying there's a chance.

Shapeshift.io is quick and easy.  Many here don't care for it but it works and you don't need an account.  Otherwise exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:04:15
Yeah there were a few posts about it back in the day.
But the point is there are so many keys it's close to impossible to duplicate one that is being used.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:11:55
Can't believe no one noticed your username.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:30:17
If I am reading that right the number of address with 1 dollar or more is just over 15 million.
This page indicates the number of 16 to 25 year old in the United States is just over 25 million.
Keeping in mind that the 15 million from the first link covers all of Bitcoin and each wallet likely has many addresses with a balance.
TLDR; not even close.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:16:31
I think you missed a few 0's.  It was 10,000 BTC if I remember correctly.

So here's the deal. Anonymous, secure, limited money attracts smart, principled, honest, hard working people. This is Bitcoin. Anonymous, money that can be conjured out of thin air with no work attracts crooked scammers and foolish victims. This is most ICOs, altcoins and the Federal Reserve.

.43 per kWh!  Ouch.  I live in a state where we pay .13 per kWh and I still invested in solar for the house.

Here they are...all of them.  Go nuts
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:54:17
Agreed!  They also included Bitcoin on the front page in a graph about wider markets.  
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:43:14
Congrats!  
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:18:35
I think they are trying to imply that all the coins are really the same because the graphs look the same?  
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:16:32
He never leaked any documents.  The FIB leaked them and blamed him so they could go after him to take all his coins.  
Sure would have made for a better Snowden movie.

Can I add coins to a paper wallet after it is created.  Lets say I buy 1 bitcoin a month, can I create a single paper wallet and store it in a safety deposit box and still send coins to it?  It seems like that would work but the paper wallet/cold storage thing is confusing. 
Edit.  Found the answer in another post from today.  The short answer is yes but make sure when you go to spend them that you generate a new paper wallet.
