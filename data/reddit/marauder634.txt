See but those things happen for a lot of reasons. Banks also make more when they don't conduct predatory loans. Banks also don't want high risk clients as they want to make money off their investments. The 2008 crisis involved a lot of other pieces like people knowing they couldn't repay loans and a few laws that shouldn't have been there. I have no knowledge of countries outside the US so I'm not commenting on them, I can talk about US stuff, but predatory lending techniques are illegal here.

Again though, if the poor have no money then they can't invest, it's self defeating

First off, that mentality is a gamblers mentality and led to things like the great depression, dot com boom and etc. If you bet it all on black today and tomorrow the bitcoin market crashed, you'd be destitute. 
Second, kodak, blockbuster etc. All failed at business and refused to innovate and grow instead trying to dig in. Shit Kodak actually invented the digital camera while also having disrupted old school cameras with disposables.

Why would you lend someone money so they can't pay you back? That's a net 0 return on investment with no gain. Banks want money not slaves. A lot of what you're saying sounds like propaganda pieces

That doesn't make sense, so greedy bankers screw up the economy to get rich by taking everyone's money so nobody will have money to invest in their businesses?

Why would bankers want to lose money by fucking up the economy?
