If you look at longer time horizons that that risk is probably a lot higher then zero. Look back 20-30 years and look at technology then and now and what says that our technology today won't evolve enough that bitcoin might be obsolete? Not to say that you shouldn't invest in bitcoin but there are risks. And if you keep your personal coins at one place then there can be a fire or something that hits one single person. You don't have the same kind of insurance for accidents or fraud that you have with other assets.

The same money that have made stocks, bonds and real estate expensive have probably made the bitcoin price rise. I believe that pretty much everything will crash at the same time. The question I think about is: what will fall the least and what sector will recover fastest?

This is probably my main concern with investing in BTC. Gold will be gold in 20 or 50 years as well and there is limited amount (even though all the gold haven't been mined yet). But the amount of cryptocurrencies will probably go on an increase and will do so exponentially. And what says the Bitcoin will be the best one? Or the most used one in 5, 10 or 20 years from now. 
Very exciting stuff though, but I am not sure the big thing is Bitcoin itself.

Being patient also means that you should wait for the right stock and buy it at the right price.
