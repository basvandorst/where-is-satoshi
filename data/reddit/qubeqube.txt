Satoshi had some great ideas. However, they never anticipated mining pools for example. Satoshi was not perfect. Quoting him is somewhat problematic.

A hard fork is miners exerting control over the network. A UASF is users (nodes) exerting control over the network. Miners do not control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:21:16


Miners leave money off the table already by mining 0-transaction blocks. Miners do this *willingly* and it has nothing to do with transactions falling out of the mempool.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:23:25
Blame Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-03-04 15:31:07
Those miners are the scum at the bottom of the bucket, quality-wise. They undoubtedly use the higher quality miners for themselves while selling the mostly faulty miners to the public. Butterfly Labs also did this. 
The funniest (and most sleezy) part of this is that you can ship your miner *back to Bitmain* to have it repaired for ~$200.

Bitcoincom's mining pool already tried hard forking Bitcoin onto a Bitcoin Unlimited chain. The out-of-consensus 1.1MB block Ver's pool mined was rejected by consensus-following Bitcoin nodes and Unlimited nodes were banned temporarily from the network. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:19:44
It's a bluff. Jihan knows he's in some deep shit now. If he walked the walk, he would've started mining Bitcoin Unlimited blocks a long time ago while simultaneously learning the hard way what not to do when the majority of the network does not agree with you like with Roger Ver's rejected block.

As with every other Bitcoin user, I can only control my own node's policy. These "stress test" transactions won't be relayed by my node thereby freeing up bandwidth for others.

@_date: 2017-03-05 15:52:58
Then you're using Bitcoin wrong. You are forgoing trustlessness aspects of Bitcoin and willfully giving control to self-serving businesses who value profit over altruism. 


We have seen that demonstrated live and broadcasted to the world when Roger Ver's mining pool generated a &gt;1MB block which was rejected as invalid by the Bitcoin network. Consequently, all Bitcoin Unlimited nodes were temporarily banned.
That was a public demonstration of the lack of influence and control miners have over Bitcoin. Miners do not control Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:17:54
I just moved my miners to a different pool. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:50:39
It's usable on testnet right now. All LN development is focused on utilizing SegWit. There is no development that I no of being worked on that does not include SegWit. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:31:10


Wrong. Fully validating highly connected nodes are the backbone of Bitcoin. Miners are merely...miners. Miners work *for users*. You are our workers. You send us your completed work (in the form of generated blocks) and we decide if they are valid or not. If invalid, we will reject your work (which you spent exorbitant amounts of electricity on). Miners have no control over Bitcoin.

“If scaling bitcoin quickly means there is a risk of [Bitcoin] becoming Paypal 2.0, I think that risk is worth taking because we will always be able to make a Bitcoin 3.0 that [. . .] has the properties that we want. But I think we only have one really good shot at having bitcoin become the default platform for people to transact on across the world. We need to make sure we scale fast enough to allow these new people come onto Bitcoin, **even if it means risking some decentralization or risking it becoming, like I said, Paypal 2.0**”

Um, the design is that fully validating nodes reject blocks which are out-of-consensus (non-segwit for BIP 148, or &gt;1MB for legacy). Miners have little control over the 100,000 full nodes that are deployed.

BitFury published a study that states 8MB blocks reduce nodes by 90%. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:27:19
That does not explain the near-empty current mempool. Game-able "indicators" such as that are not reliable. Marketcap dominance is another "indicator" which is spammed around like it is some sort of meaningful data. 


Some? The Bitfury paper states **95%** of nodes will be excluded within 6 months. That leaves only those with the resources to gain control of further consensus changes (enforced by fully validating nodes) and pricing out individuals who simply want sovereignty and to not be dictated to by corporate profiteers. All for a measly 4x the current capacity? Peter R's chart stated that we would need &gt; 1GB blocks to reach VISA scalability. SegWit2x is the abandonment of sovereign money for a modicum of scalability. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:46:40
They've also published research that says 8MB blocks exclude 95% of the nodes within 6 months. That's *terrible*.

The previous spam was also obvious. No project nor individual sends minuscule amounts of Bitcoin every 2 seconds to themselves over a period of 48 hours. That didn't stop them from spamming, now did it? Look at the mempool now. It's barely scratching 4MB. The spam was purely to push an agenda and it will happen again. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:05:39
I think Bitfinex's listing as `bcash` versus other names is a good idea. Other exchanges should follow suit.

Then we don't need SegWit2x. Especially so considering it requires an inevitably contentious hard fork. Keep up? You just argued yourself into a contradiction - that SegWit2x is unneeded.

GHash.io abused their hash rate in order to double spend Bitcoins at a Satoshi-Dice gambling site clone. Once their maliciousness was publicized, users started leaving.

@_date: 2017-07-13 19:58:36
We're talking about increasing the block size limit to 8MB, not keeping it at 1MB forever. Your comment makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 01:04:37


Well, that's exactly what my full node does. Deal with it. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:45:17


That's because SegWit is...SegWit. "SegWit2x" is an intentionally misleading title to give to a project that increases the block size limit **8 times**.


You damn well know how vulnerable Bitcoin is to agenda-pushing mempool spam. We will see 8MB blocks soon enough, and I guarantee Jihan will be calling to hard fork to even bigger blocks which will exclude more users which will inevitably lead to BitMAIN Nodes for $20,000 a pop colocated in BitMAIN's China datacenter. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:41:41
You can talk all you want regarding "we will *neverrrr* see 8MB blocks", but until you show anyone research you're just spouting nonsense as far as I am concerned. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:28:32
Head over to r/bcash to discuss where to trade BCH / `bcash`. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 19:04:02
Privacy will be eroded so much so, once 95% of nodes are excluded (due to Segwit2x's 8MB blocks) and users are forced to trust 3rd-party nodes, there will be little point to the improvements currently in development. Example, you *can* run Joinmarket in a configuration where it connects to Blockr.io (3rd-party node) in order to coinjoin, but you will forgo a large portion of the privacy a full node enables. Blockr.io (acquired by Coinbase) will at that point know a) which IP address you connect from and b) your transactions + other parties' transactions in the coinjoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:19:34
What do you think of Bitfury's research that says SegWit2x blocks will centralize the node network?
@_date: 2017-07-13 18:52:47
The fact remains that without these companies undoing pseudonymity, Bitcoin would have better privacy properties. Subsequently, there is the owner of said privacy-undoing company working on a fork of Bitcoin which will push out individuals' nodes and only leaves those with the resources (companies) left to run nodes. What that does is create an environment where said spy-companies run the only nodes, where they can apply all the KYC and AML that they wish; turning Bitcoin into a horribly less-efficient dictatorship like PayPal.
It truly is a decision to keep Bitcoin's decentralized leaderless properties, or turn Bitcoin into PayPal; where at an executive's whim they can force protocol changes upon the last remaining suckers who use Bitcoin at that point. You will have traded a relatively minuscule amount of "scaling" for the entirety of Bitcoin's decentralized (read: adversary resistance).

First of all, SegWit"2x" is 8MB blocks. Bitfury published research that stated blocks of that size exclude 95% of fully validating nodes within 6 months. *There has been research on this subject, it is not "theoretical" in any sense.* 
So, your comment here:


..is, in fact, completely false. 
If 95% of nodes cannot keep up or their operators cannot afford to run them, the protocol-change-resistant nature (full nodes reject out-of-consensus blocks) of Bitcoin is eroded. Miners and/or adversaries can then force whatever changes they want on FrankenBitcoin's users (like they are attempting to with SegWit2x/backdoor NYA).
8MB blocks are a poison pill.

Or from someone who runs Vulcan, the wallet company that requires the government's signature to transact your Bitcoins. Or from the *same* person who runs Skry, the company that analyzes the Bitcoin blockchain to de-anonymize users (which could have life-threatening implications)?

If miners don't activate SegWit by August 1st, it will be activated on the nodes that users have applied the BIP 148 patch to. Then, the non-segwit blocks mined by miners will be orphaned by BIP 148 nodes which could result in a chain split.

These are the words of a man trying to save his ass. Hey were you or were you not part of the White Hat Group? The Ethereum Foundation is a bunch of frauds.

Yeah if you could toss some of that $1,000,000,000 valuation towards customer service, that would be swell.

Satoshi himself set the 1MB limit for spam which has worked out wonderfully.

Sorry you got bamboozled by Wright. Maybe get some therapy?

"Turing completeness was a red herring." - Vitalik Buterin.
Do you understand the implications of such a statement as that? "Turing completeness" was designed to be misleading to investors and we have the kingpin of the investment scheme admitting it on twitter.

You're forgetting Craig Fraud Wright's 20% nethash non-segwit pool (which will undoubtedly get hashes from BitMAIN in some manner).

BitPay is simply a front for BitMAIN. Spair's rhetoric changed instantly once BitPay received the multi-million dollar funding from BitMAIN. They're merely useless hand puppet stooges.

The miners Bitmain sells are backdoored with Antbleed.
