The add video sold me, it was professional looking. Just recently even tried first crypto portfolio apps and as haven't "had need" for one. I.ve maybe had blockfolio for week installed so don't have a lot of experience of alternatives. The tour of the app seemed well done. Nice to see there is even my local Scandinavian stocks to be found, not even on many stock portfolio apps! Looks promising, this review of mine was with couple of min messing around with the app. Ofcourse if it's just out there will be lot of bugs (some asserted in this topic, I didn't notice any yet with honor 7) and additions to come if you keep up the good work. Have to keep trying this app out, looks promising. Might this be the killer One app for both stocks &amp; crypto. The amount of work with large spread inputting all info makes you just check the status in for example the exchanges app and makes you lazy of trying similar apps. cryptonomynow dot com tried to check for premium vs free edition features but didn't find that info. About the premium version price it looks high for a mobile app in my opinion. Comparing it to for example lastpass 2$/month or 24$ annual vs 6,99$/month or 60$ annual. Still interested and would be nice to know what the free version is missing vs pro. Also showing volumes would be nice, didn't see that kind of "advanced" graph.
