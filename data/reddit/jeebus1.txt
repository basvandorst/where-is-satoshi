Localbitcoins' prices (for both buying/selling) in my area are ridiculous, but bitstamp looks promising, cheers. Think my bank's SEPA charge is around £10 too, so not too bad. Drop your address here if you want the .005.

I sometimes sell coins for cash in the post/bank transfers. Yeah, I know it sounds shifty, but my rates aren't as ridiculous as the ones on localbitcoins for instance. Initially considered doing this through ebay, but decided against it as it's too much effort. Same for using localbitcoins...actually, I don't even know why I'm posting this. But if anyone's interested just message me. Also, I'm not a day trader or anything, so I don't have a massive supply of coins, but should be able to help with most requests.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:49:35
You reposted this? Really?
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:47:35
Scrolling through that gave me a headache. We don't need every article involving the word 'bitcoin' posted here.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:27:21
I haven't read beyond the title. And there really is no need to. Saying that this isn't a bubble is just as informed/useful as me saying that bitcoin is a bubble that will definitely pop tomorrow. It's all very well that you have high hopes for bitcoin, but attempting to pass off your speculation as anything but that is just silly.
Speaking in absolutes in relation to bitcoin just screams 'lolz I hope it goes this way so I don't lose money that I have invested'.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:37:44
Why do people think e-wallets are even a good place to store your coins? It really isn't too difficult to use an offline wallet.

I think you're better off posting that on the actual site. Good points though.

A single legitimate purchase with your coins is not going to be of much use when the majority are still hoarding.
@_date: 2013-05-07 18:17:15
Thank you bubble. You're doing the internet, and mankind, a great service.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:54:28
Even if 90% of people here would actually use their coins to see a film, this would translate to such a small portion of the general public anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:29:09
Most of those vendors are on localbitcoins selling coins for a little cheaper. Still way over market rate though (£65-75 now), so I still wouldn't use them.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:14:02
If they need the money and can't afford to lose it, this is terrible advice. Anything could happen to cause bitcoin to tank.

@_date: 2013-04-08 12:45:46
$200 probably isn't more than a day or so away. I'd been watching bitcoin since November but only bought in at $22. I thought I was 'too late' to the party. Now I'm wondering if there'll ever be a time where it's too late to buy in, assuming this isn't a bubble that's about to pop. Anyone's guess.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:21:00
Monday afternoon should give us a better idea of where the price will sit. Or at least that's my guess.

The worrying thing is there are probably several people here who are somehow convinced that this is imminent.
@_date: 2013-03-26 14:05:21
On a somewhat related note, can anyone point me in the direction of the best exchange/site to sell your coins to? Would need GBP (£) to be accepted though.
Also, if I were to just use Mt.gox, would the only fees I pay be that 0.6%? It would probably be an international bank transfer into my account, based on what I saw on their site. Thanks.

@_date: 2013-03-23 05:58:48
Before the recent huge increases, coins weren't seeing significant increases in value each day were they? Changes were always gradual (but not slow), so seeing the price dip slightly shouldn't be a cause for concern. What would be concerning is the price of 1 BTC increasing by these amounts on a DAILY basis. I'll go for the brief 'crash' periods such as the one going on now.
It was only a weeks ago that coins dropped to somewhere in the late 30s, so this little dip down by $5 is nothing to worry about.
At least in the short-term.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:43:20
I think it was either on their facebook or twitter page, but I read that bistamp were working to get a UK bank account opened up, which would be great news. Hopefully they make it happen.
How are the fees when using Mt.gox?

This guy is clearly jonesing for some meth.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:03:35
That's pretty shitty. You still should've never used a seller with little feedback on localbitcoins, especially for a transaction that large. Someone else posted a similar story about someone running off with their money, so I imagine this could become increasingly common. Either stick to trusted sellers or arrange a more secure meeting place next time.

I don't want to read that.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:41:13
No need to be a douche. OP has a valid point. We did just come out of a crash and hit a low of $50 not too long ago. So it was anyone's guess as to whether the price would stabilise at a lower price, fall back down to 2012 prices, or shoot back up. Plus, there's the psychological factor to $100.
It's still's anyone's guess as to where the price will land, but if this is kept up (obviously too early to tell), then I guess we'll be seeing the typical daily/weekly price increases that you're referring to. Which means more 'omg new high' posts. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:16:58
The percentage drop wasn't even as bad as the one from a few weeks ago when the price dropped to the 30s. Oh psychology.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:05:17
This kind of presumptious speculation is pretty useless. It may not be what people want to hear, but it is. Obviously I'd like for this to happen, but you saying that bitcoin will reach this kind of value, has as much worth as merit saying the price will tank tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:51:21
Some people here should really look up the word stability. Jesus.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:30:34
Yeah, because people on reddit can predict the market. Yup.
@_date: 2013-03-27 13:40:37

@_date: 2013-04-23 01:22:38
Ah okay, makes sense, thanks. Can't be too good for bitcoin if the big players are just looking to make money out of it. Suppose you can't blame them though. Assuming this is the case, would them dumping their coins pretty much immediately cause a huge drop in the price?
@_date: 2013-05-09 00:46:56
I simply wrote that to piss you off because your 'warning' makes you come across as a little bitch. Sorry broseph, it's true.
You should just learn that people are always going to be ignorant, there's no point getting annoyed about it. Especially on the internet. On reddit. On where I imagine most don't give a shit about where you're from. Maybe that little disclaimer would've had more of a place if you were posting a link to something specifically related to Colombia/drugs on another subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:00:36
Because, despite what others may think, no one here is psychic. Those same people who vigorously masturbate to the thought of 1 bitcoin being worth $100,000 are the same who would've refused to say that prior growth wasn't a bubble. No one here knows shit about where bitcoin will be in the long-term. It's worrying that there are so many people who are in denial about this.
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:03:03

Going back up to $80 now, due to the Americans wanting to buy cheap coins I think.
Monday morning is probably when we'll get a rough idea of where abouts the price will linger. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:10:00
Minimum is £100, as it's not worth it for me otherwise. Though I don't mind doing a £50 deal to gain trust. In this case, £50 would land you with £42.50 coins at the market rate either a) the same afternoon if you pay before 4pm, or b) the market rate at around 1pm the next day, if I receive payment after this time. Again, I have solid feedback on there.

Oh you're right; I still think the average Joe has no idea what bitcoin is. What I meant was due to press coverage, silk road and reddit even, a lot more of the technologically literate are aware of it now. Due to the internet being what it is today, this is probably a big number, despite being a tight demographic.

@_date: 2013-03-24 19:26:10
Oh, you think bitcoins are going to be huge? Don't believe everything you read on here, especially the people saying bitcoin will be huge or crash imminently. They are equally irrelevant opinions (key word). Only the former mindset is met with the dripping ejaculate of investors who furiously +1 such comments and most likely ignore the more critical speculation over Bitcoin's future.
Everyone is clueless as to where Bitcoin is truly headed, despite the recent surge in prices prompting people to call BTC the best thing since sliced bread. Few people care to admit that we can only speculate over BTC's future. 
In the very short-term though, it's probably safe to say that barring a technical fuckup/disaster with exchanges, bitcoin will increase in value, I just wouldn't invest anything too substantial at this point. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:02:05

He's clearly an exploitative douche, but people are so stupid. Are they really too lazy to educate themselvee before throwing their money away?
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:16:13
What would cause the price to ever reach the $200's again? I'm speaking in the short term (&lt;1 year). It's probably fair to say that the price only got that high due to media coverage on how huge the price increases were, and as a result, a mass influx of speculators in the market.
At this point, the masses' faith in bitcoin as an investment (let's be real, outside of the deep web, no one truly considers bitcoin a currency just yet) will have disappeared, so I don't see the price hitting new highs daily like previously.
Or I could be wrong, but who knows.

@_date: 2013-04-07 23:08:51
Asking others to spend their bitcoins on the very limited range of goods/services it can buy makes me think you're aware that there are moare hoarders than spenders, and have this false belief that even the remotest use of bitcoin as an actual currency will reduce the likelihood of this being a bubble, and you losing your investment.
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:30:22
Haha pretty much.
@_date: 2013-03-28 22:57:32
Businesses (at least regular ones, not threatened by banks) will never take bitcoin seriously if it fluctuates to such stupid degrees on a weekly basis. And that's not even including the $2-5 dips that usually happens every day.
Most people here seem to not mind though. I'll just assume they're investors, and not people who want bitcoin to actually take off as a legitimate currency. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:09:00
The recent increases look exactly like a repeat of the previous upward trend to 260...don't know what you're looking at.

Only on reddit.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:28:03
I don't really see people in the general public putting their faith in a currency whose value increased by over  700% since December.  I definitely see people accepting bitcoin as an investment, but not as a currency used for regular goods/services. Widespread adoption of bitcoin is a very long-term objective anyway, and would firstly require more traditional businesses accepting them beforehand. Still, a good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:51:07
You put forward such an excellent case, I may just have to.

Do deposits always take 3 days with them?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:40:19
Is there not an exchange that can have you link your bank account and (after any necessary security precautions) buy bitcoins that will be in your wallet immediately?
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:35:18
Posts like these make me wonder if there are people on here that even want bitcoin to be adopted as an actual currency, and are facepalming at how many speculators just see it as a profit-making machine.

@_date: 2013-04-23 22:16:13
If this keeps up, then we'll be out of the 100s by early May I'm guessing. There's obviously going to be a psychological factor to a $250/260 price rise, so if we reach that point alarmingly quick, I'll probably sell before then. 
But then I imagine everyone else would end up thinking the same thing. $200 is where I'd start considering a good time to sell.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:18:20
Haha, nice. Although, you're not rich until you cash out into fiat. At least in the short-term (~5 years maybe), given how bitcoin is being looked at by most as an investment rather than a currency. Plus there's the whole us being clueless as to whether this is a bubble or not. Oh bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:30:07
Isn't this just looking like bubble 2.0?

@_date: 2013-04-04 22:49:12
Yeah, no e-wallet is safe, as recent events will show.
If you don't feel like downloading the huge blockchain with Bitcoin-qt, then Multibit or Armory are good wallets to keep your coins in. You can download them all for free.

Nah, it's just our American cousins waking up.
@_date: 2013-03-28 23:11:16
The goods that you can buy from well-known merchants with bitcoin are still very limited and mostly concentrated in North America. Plus, the businesses who have already adopted bitcoin aren't exactly regular ones that the average Joe would frequent, and so appeal to a very specific (online) demographic. 
However bitcoin ends up, it's probably safe to say we won't be seeing its true potential as a currency in the short-term, so time will tell eh.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:59:06
Are withdrawals smooth with Bitstamp?
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:38:23
with a spatulaaa!
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:08:06
That is a long way away (if at all). Bitcoin can still barely be used as an actual currency, given the limited range of goods/services you can buy with it. Especially if you're outside of the US. Plus, the more prominent businesses accepting bitcoin tend to either cater to a very specific demo, or are based online.
Though yeah, most people consider bitcoin an investment. Probably not a good thing if stays this way.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:50:22
I sell coins on eBay (but payment via bank transfer obviously due to paypal chargebacks). Message me if you want a link to the listing. I sell at the weighted avg on mt.gox, excluding my fixed 15% cut, ie: £200 gets you £170 at the market rate. I only started selling on there, so this will probably increase to 20% once I've sold to eough people. I have good feedback from those I've sold to. I considered using localbitcoins, but considered it too much effort, especially as I have no history on my account there. Coins are with you same-day if payment is received during business hours. Otherwise, it's a 24 hour turnaround max.
If you're looking to go through more official channels though, I recommend the bitstamp/transferwise method. Seems the best option for us in the UK
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:20:30
Fair enough. The issue with your post still lies in how you consider bitcoin a get rich quick scheme. As in, you look at it as a way to make money, not as a currency itself. The big boys who play about with the market most likely share the exact same thinking; they're just smarter than you.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:45:58
In real world terms, bitcoin is still far from stable. Open your eyes brah.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:11:48
The masses aren't going to bother looking into the technicalities of bitcoin. They see what happened these past few days and will steer clear from bitcoin - both as a currency, and an investment.
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:49:09
Yeah, I always manage to find a copy at some point during the day. It's a decent read actually. Though the people on rush hour crush make me want to facepalm right there on the tube...
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:40:14
Again with the referrals.
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:51:49
There's nothing stable about going from $110 to $145 in three days. For us, it seems relatively steady given how fast the price shot up to $260 last month, but bitcoin is still not growing at a sustainable rate. Not even close.
Which probably means that if the price keeps on increasing this fast, the bubble will burst..again.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:35:21

@_date: 2013-04-24 02:16:12
Well yeah, it will make it harder for regular people to buy bitcoins quickly, and without too much effort. This will obviously hinder its growth as a currency until an efficient/cost-effective way of getting bitcoins comes along for those with limited options.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:13:36
Leech moar.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:45:04
$90 to $130 in three days is not a steady rise in value. It's still way too big of a price rise for sustainable growth. The prior growth to $260 was just ridiculous, and this recent increase is similarly not indicative of stable/organic growth.
Also, it's pretty obvious how you just want others to make you feel better about your 'investment'. The thing is, people here are just as clueless as you.

What's sad is that you give a shit. Just ignore the posts you consider stupid and read the ones worth reading; not too hard.
Oh, and I'll take these kind of memes over the idiots flooding the site by posting everytime bitcoin reaches a new high.
@_date: 2013-03-23 05:47:39
I can already tell this isn't for you.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:47:20
clutching at straws.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:48:01
Too much sense in this post for the people with thousands invested.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:36:01
Thanks, will give that a try.

4 hours is nothing. Give it 24 before worrying, though you'll probably get them later tonight.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:18:41
There's a referral link in there, right?
@_date: 2013-04-06 22:17:55
No, it's not. The range of products on there does not even come close.
For obvious reasons.

Would they ever become truly worthless though? 
Even if bitcoin just withers away and dies for whatever reason (uncle Sam, legality, technical fuckup etc.), it's on people's radar now and has generated enough interest recently, that I think people down the road would still be buying, whether for fun or for misguided speculation.

Not reckless advice at all brah.

My hands were busy.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:13:30
So much wrong with this post. You're convinced bitcoin would be nearing $400 by now? Come on brah. Don't get mad at the financially savvy just because you presumably lost some of your investment.
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:24:11
Don't worry, just look at the 'headlines' on the right as you scroll down to lose faith in the DM again.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:44:27
Dangerous thinking.
@_date: 2013-05-15 00:24:03
can't even stabilise for a few days, can you bitcoin? you dirty slut.
@_date: 2013-03-26 00:23:29
It's only been 2 hours, don't worry. I had a 0BTC fee transaction take 11 hours to show up.
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:11:25
And it's a Sunday...
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:30:19
Is it the same for Barclays?
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:19:04
I'll take that over upvoting anything pro-bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:53:49
Was it a mistake then?
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:41:22
Previous bubbles were nowhere near the dollar value it's been at since March, so no.
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:09:59
Can lag come about from panic sellers flooding gox with sell orders?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:41:31
Translation: I'm an attention-whore. Also, I'm an idiot.

Experience is irrelevant when it comes to the market, given how all our opinions on bitcoin's future are equally worthless. Sure, some may be more grounded in fact/figures/history, but at the end of the day, it's all just pretty pointless speculation. Any number of things could happen to affect the market, despite the recent increases in the value of bitcoin.
It's just going to take something other than massive upward growth to have people admit this.
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:04:52
Well, I suppose the instability can be a bad thing because person X can use $900 to buy a TV worth 10 coins, and by the time they're able to/or want to spend their coins, that same TV could now cost 10.20 coins due to market fluctuation. Or vice versa. You're not really thinking objectively here if you say that a consistent $3-5 dips are of no consequence.
No matter what people on here think, you're not going to get the average Joe adopting bitcoin anytime soon (~5 years) unless there's an some kind of economic fuck up (ie: Cyprus), but on a much larger scale. That's not to say bitcoin doesn't have a future as a currency though.
