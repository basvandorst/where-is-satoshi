Institutional narrative is wrong. Was Satoshi’s whitepaper titled: “Permissioned, Exchange based, rehypothecation payment system.” Exactly the opposite, the individual user is how the power is taken back. So many lemmings, sheep running of the cliff begging for regulation and institutions $, when that is exactly the corruption that bitcoin can solve. Dystopian madness, wake up crypto movement before bitcoin is neutered. Peer to peer, decentralized payment system does not have to be hijacked.

The highest parts of the establishment do not want to be part of bitcoin community, they want to control it  and rightly so as it is a threat to their monopolistic control and bottom line. 
Further, the vast majority of crypto news is written from a pro institutional perspective, therefore it is literally right now changing the narrative about what bitcoin is and how it should be used. Bringing awareness to the other side is balance. 
I would like to see the power of community thru bitcoin change the corrupt status quo rather than have the status quo turn bitcoin into PayPal.

This my hope as well, although we would be naive to ignore there are many actors with very different motives, ie international banks.

Right on, I’m running btcpay server to help merchant adoption. Love the idea of crypto wages too. Both are solid solutions to get more individuals involved and less begging the banks. I am a firm believer in price manipulation in btc and especially the December pump and dump to drive small guys out and let biggest players consolidate the space in mergers. That is business as usual, chrony capitalism / centralization and it’s not good. 
Here is a great read: If u want to learn more of where my critique is grounded in.
