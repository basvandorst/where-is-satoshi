Wait so I had about .1 BTC on the servers that weren't paid. Is it possible to remove it? I want using there wallet

Because I don't think it was deposited in a normal method.

I had the same thing happen. I'm pretty new to all this, but this along with a few other things, I have the feeling coinbase is playing loose.

I love the shit post articles that's pop up in my Google feed. Bitcoin drops $2000 in only a few hours.
Nothing about how much it has gone up.

I want to cash out no then buy back in. but coinbase is down. how else do i even do it?

Just purchased one myself with Bitcoin. First purchase using it.

cost me $144 cad and I thought that was steep.

So I feel very similar. Most of my BTC is in my copay wallo, but I have about $30 of BTC on Coinbase. Is there a method to get it to my wallet without paying $20 fee. Can I convert it to something else, then send it to my wallet. As you probably guessed, I'm pretty new to all this. I'm in it for the Long haul, and don't want to support cash or Coinbase. But I'm assuming not.

I wish I had gone with my gut, no risk no reward. Almost bought in at $2300 CAD, but didn't. Mined a little bit with my personal computer, and just watched. Just seeing it now go over $17000... crazy. Wish I had a raise in 4 years as inflation just keeps rising, then at least this wouldn't hurt as much. One day I would like to buy a house. Congrats though.

Just got in awhile back, was going to have a decent payout tomorrow or the next, but nicehash got hacked and I lost it all. What I get for doing it the paint by numbers way. Now I want to cash the measly $350 USD worth I got, but coinbase is down.

0.02 can relate
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:09:10
you right honestly.

I have invested a little. 0.02 BTC haha but that won't get me far. Only problem with investing slowly is I'm late to the party, and the better it does now the less effective any further invest.
