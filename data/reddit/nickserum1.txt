But you have to invest in something that will be a huge success. things don't just become a thing without a backing.  
If you look at all these great Cryptobank startups like Bancor, BAANX, Shivom and BABB, they need investments to be able to let people use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to save/secure/loan and even in some like BAANX, let you create your own cryptobank

This is why i would always just secure/save/invest it in a cyptobank like Baanx or Binance and leave it there to do it's own thing!
