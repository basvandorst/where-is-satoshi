Exactly, it's a much safer solution to a paper wallet, good for giving away someone BTC safely, not a long-term storage.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:31:42
thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:41:32
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:05:48
Thank you. 
Opendime should not be used as a long-term storage imho, since at the end of the day to put the money out of it, you need a secure PC environment. However for small amounts it can be a good solution.
Perhaps for your use case, a hardware wallet is better fitted solution, just my two cents.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:52:33
Thank you for the kind words my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:41:47
Cheers xbach, enjoyed writing it.

I prefer more neutral approach as I like to provide feedback instead skepticism, especially because most of the issues I encountered can be fixed with a simple firmware update. If I encountered a serious security flaw, of course, I would be harsher. I just try to keep a neutral point, not telling people to buy this or buy that. The ecosystem is quite complex here and I know what sort of problems these companies are facing (growth issues, fiat/bitcoin issues, regulatory issues)


It's not just nice looking; it also has decent build quality, that's an advantage for me. I agree that the sentence you're referring to should be edited though will do it.


I wasn't getting defensive I just have a problem when people make assumptions based on a few sentences instead of the whole article.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:22:07
No need to update it. Beta is just that - a beta.
The review clearly mentions the possibility of implementation of the ERC-20 in the future.
I never said there's no development, I said it's quite slower and behind the competitors.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:49:17
Haha, thank you for that.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:54:33
Would those coins had to be used or just as a cold storage? I think Andreas breaks it down quite well [in this video]( HD wallets are provide resonable protection and ease of use imho, but they still have room for progress, we yet have to invent the trustless hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:10:48
Yup, the update is planned.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:15:46
Yes, as long as you keep the firmware and the app updated, it should have all the features.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:37:50
I assume older people would appreciate the larger screen and built quality, I can't comment on the other features until I fully try it out. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:00:06
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:20:40
Hah, he's in that case sitting on much bigger collection than this ;)
I thought it was cool as my interest are wallets, bookmarked it. I asked him if there's PDF as it would be easier to read info that way.
Anyway, this shows that browsing market section on BCT forum is not always useless :)
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:45:06
Good work!
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:00:35
I'd recommend you to read a bit about hd wallets on the Bitcoin Wiki, here's the [link](
I don't comment which wallet is better. People have different preferences and needs. What might work for me, might not be good for you. It's the best to do your own research and learn what suits you. HD wallets are different. They have different ethics, interfaces, privacy setups, prices, etc. So you need to make your list of priorities as there's no wallet on the market which is the best in all aspects. Each has good and bad things.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:41:36
Glad you found it helpful. It means I haven't wasted my time on writing it ;)

Here's my review of the Opendime 
And OD is the only that has a video review as well 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:36:22
So is this similar to opendime?
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:17:46
Read the whole article, or if you do not have the time at least the summary. I try to cover every product fairly and in an unbiased way. Yes, the look and feel of the wallet is excellent, and I do consider that a plus.
The last paragraph of the article explains that hardware wallets are not meant to be pretty. 
I love when people pull one sentence out of context and then just post it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:44:02
To be honest, I do not fully understand what happens inside. I've asked a similar question, still waiting for a reply on my ticket.
I'd refer you to their devs docs  
In layman words, device storage is limited, your coins are all safe since they all derive from the same seed, but in order to use them on the Nano S itself, you'd have to swap between the apps due to limited storage space that the device has.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:18:16
Correct, someone already mentioned that I'll have a look. I said in the article it's on the roadmap, I believe it's still in alpha, but will test it out.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:46:12
I do that, but I'm not here 24/7. I think there should be a concise policy.
Also, some of the sites posted contained some sort of malware, I don't have a source link, but I remember someone giving the warning about it.
I really would like to see at least a flair if nothing elsewhere a news comes from "verified" source and for those other dudes something like "not verified". At least that, though I'd rather see them banned, though another sort of dudes at  r/btc would love to see this and talk about it...
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:45:11
Even if that's the possibility, your private key is backed up, you import it into your backup wallet, your key - your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:28:28
Good feedback, thanks for sharing your experience.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:02:55
Bitchcoin :D
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:49:18
Your "money" is kept in your private keys. Hardware wallets just make :
1. Key generation more secure, random and out of the "eyes" of third parties like key loggers and malware.
2. Transfers easier without exposing your ptivate keys.
There are few more advantages but these are the most obvious ones.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:08:34
These bots are getting smarter each day. Look at his comment history, copy/pasting parts of the articles all over Reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:52:48
Haha this is great!
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:26:17
Appreciate it! Still, have to test few more features and fix typos, but wanted this online asap as there's no much information on it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:36:53
Thanks for the info, that's really good news.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:16:01
Interesting interview. Thanks for sharing.

You're getting a tax advice from a dude who moved to Japan to avoid paying taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:08:14
Absolutely, you cam have those three at the same time.
Yes, exactly.
You own the private keys, so yes. As for getting a particular fork, just google it around, but be careful, I,d transfer the coins to a newly generated seed to make sure scam forks can't get your btc.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:00:21
It's because the Nano S does not have sufficient space.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:57:33
You're right. Since I only test BTC, I overlooked this one. Probably read an outdated doc or something, can't remember. Still can't believe I missed it. Was rushing to get it done. Credited you in the update.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:11:08
Thank you, appreciate it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:45:58
Thank you, my auto-corrector got me on that one. I've now corrected the typo.

I'm still in process of writing my KeepKey review. I'll post it on [my blog]( once I'm done. I would not like to comment on it until I fully test it.
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:18:22
Oh my, yup, corrected, thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:47:23
It's completely open-source, so anyone with a knowlwdge can inspect it at Github.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:50:50
No. In Dorian we trust.
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:17:16
If you can afford two devices that's always good to have for to recovery your keys if one is broken. It's not a must though.

This question appears quite a lot here. I have both and have published quite detailed comparison which won't specifically tell you which one to get but might help you understand them better and learn. 
I also have reviewed each of them in separate articles, so check them out as well together with other resources to determine which one fits your needs better.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:20:02
Hm, heard some stories about that, but got good support from both companies. I do not like that Ledger currently makes it harder for you to reach out to them due to a large number of requests. I sent 3 emails to them today, all 3 replied within an hour though. Support for both is very good imho.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:03:01
If you wrote you're a 16-year-old this post would get better traction mate.
Good article though.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:18:08
Could be if you do not verify the address via the mobile app. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:38:48
Short answer yes. Long answer, "amount of coins to store" should not be the only decision maker, there are so many things like security, ux, ui, privacy, company ethics. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:26:34
Thanks so much for sharing this. I can't wait to go through it. Posts like this should be sticky for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:53:43
Yes, Opendime is dope. :-)
Pre-ordered ColdCard and Trezor T.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:47:09
thanks, Mr. Nakamoto!

Unfortunately, it's not my project, just stumbled upon it accidentally.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:17:29
Yup, we're all good, probably misunderstood each other. :)
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:32:04
Hey Yoda, I already did a KeepKey review a while ago :-)
Edit: Lol, I'm blind. No idea why I read KeepKey.
Yup, my Trezor T is on its way, waiting for it.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:22:16


Thanks, I actually mentioned that. Covered it a bit more in-depth in my [Nano S review](
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:37:43


Verification can be done via the app/phone. (Samurai wallet for example)
Regardless, you have an interesting project, keep it up. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:18:33
Thank you!

Well for Digital Bitbox you don't have to type seeds, they are automatically backed-up on an SD card. But you'd need to take good care of the SD card and probably make few copies. I provided some specific tips on DB and this method of storing the seeds [here](

I've spent quite a while playing around with Opendime and I think it does a really good job for its purpose. There are several things I listed as disadvantages in my review here 
Is this project meant for the same purpose? Because physical damage makes it easy to verify if the key is revealed or not. I'm not sure how running a function would help in person to person transactions which should be quick and instant?
Just curios, don't get me wrong. I love learning about these type of projects.
