Improper use of quotation marks, OP.

It's entirely possible that the "missing" 800,000 BTC never existed in the first place, either due to accounting errors or outright fraud on the part of Mt.Gox.

Aaaaaand no picture of the advertised space suit has been posted yet.  Will OP deliver?
Edit 1: In fact, I'm guessing OP does not have a replica space suit.  But surely a T-shirt will do instead (P.S. OP photoshopped a stock photo of a white T-shirt)!
Edit 2: Okay, I stand corrected on one point: OP *does* have a T-shirt.  But does he have a space suit and if so, will he wear it?

Since there were no actual bitcoins backing the transactions, shouldn't the transaction fees be waived retroactively and returned to the customers?

What about the fact that Karpeles, Gay-Bouchery, and Mt.Gox lied in their public statements and misled depositors?  Please tell me this will at least have *some* bearing on the legal proceedings!

I think what OP has just discovered is that children are very impressionable at such a young age.


So whose credit cards and bank accounts did he use to sign up for Circle and Coinbase?

Second, did you mean "clickbaity"?

In general, the integrity of digital evidence (and *physical evidence*, for that matter) is a legitimate concern. However, in my opinion, the courts and jurists have sufficiently resolved such issues as pertain to its admissability.
For further reading, I recommend taking a look at the following:
* [Digital evidence](
* [Electronic discovery](

The evidence against Carl Mark Force IV was so overwhelming, the digital trail leading back to his illegal conduct was so *difficult* to erase and/or hide, that he and his lawyer were smart to enter into a plea agreement.
[The vast majority (roughly 90%) of criminal cases in the United States are settled by plea bargain rather than by a jury trial.](
Plea deals are a common thing and there is nothing improper about them. The government often does this to save the money and time required of a trial. Defendants and their attorneys accept them when they know their chances of receiving a favorable outcome at trial are poor. Yes, they are usually rewarded (e.g. charge reduction or sentence reduction) for their guily plea, tantamount to a de facto conviction, in exchange for sparing the government the expense of a trial.
My understanding is that Ross Ulbricht was also offered a plea deal by the U.S. government, but he and his lawyer (Dratel) unwisely chose to refuse it.
**Edit** I'm guessing that your and PoM's/VJ's displeasure is caused by the following clause of the above mentioned, publicaly available plea agreement: 


This is clearly *not* the same thing as "destruction of evidence". The government is merely enumerating the reasons why Force is not allowed to renege on his guilty plea; there is no reason for them to actively retain evidence against Force as long as they have his admission of guilt in writing.

If the world's entire money supply M3 (~75 trillion USD as of 2012) was converted to the full possible amount of BTC (21 million), then 1 BTC would equal 3,571,428.57 USD.

I am going to get downvoted for this, but I have to say that this is shameful: most everyone pushing for the 1mBTC/$1.00 adoption is trying to trick the market into repeating the price surge from when 1 whole BTC equaled 1 dollar.
