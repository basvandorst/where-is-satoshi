You can keep your pride and bitterness. Let the jews keep their humility and grace.

Where is a good ATM to buy Bitcoin in Melbourne? Preferably one that is easy to use.

isn't this a patch release (according to semver) since it's 0.18.1?

If you are a retailer that believes in bitcoin, why not put your money where your mouth is? sell your products discounted for lightning payments. so if you normally have a %30 profit margin on your product, sell it for 10%-15% less with lightning. you'll be encouraging adoption, and if the dick line is true your bitcoin will massively appreciate in 3 years.

Spoiler Alert: Chomsky doesn't believe in a system without money, and rightfully directs the question to the question of whether we can have a system without Tyranny.

I must be crazy. I love BTC when it goes up. I love it when it goes down. BTC memes give me life. I'm so excited and terrified by the future. I cannot get enough of it.

the inevitable failure of libra will reinforce the widely held apprehensiveness by people who are committed to remaining ignorant about bitcoin and crypto in general.

I think you are right that he might love bitcoin. Chomsky has got interesting views on Marxism as well. [

Thanks for the vocab lesson. I think Libra will be less useful as people learn about its shortcomings compared to bitcoin and the tendency of central banks to use crypto to issue fiat. As for people being committed to being ignorant, are there really no examples that come to mind? Flat earthers/Antivaxxers/Trump supporters?

I see where the makefile downloads the images but how are they made?
@_date: 2019-06-18 20:33:49
Some people are committed to putting their heads in the sands, or clamping their ears and shouting LALALALA
in this case it is instinctively associating crypto with a useless scam. see Peter Schiff for example.

In the age of Bitcoin, is it wise to weaponize the USD?

Where is the source for the images? I'm not running anything that's not open source.
@_date: 2019-12-24 02:03:07
Thanks for explaining that. It still seems like I need to trust them to build the images for me unless I do it myself.

This meme exhibits a clear misunderstanding of Bitcoin as well as a disturbing attempt to dehumanize bankers. 
Andreas Antonopoulos made the first analogy between Bitcoin and a sewer rat:


BTW rats are very cute and intelligent pets.

that page is the closest thing I've seen to the matrix since the movie came out. it would be interesting to see a time series chart.

I wonder if having a second factor that is tied to the origin of the site would have helped in this case.

I'm going through Stadicus' raspibolt guide using Bitcoin core v0.17.0.1. I'm an idiot and missed the detail about setting `txindex=1`. I managed to sync the whole blockchain but do I need to resync the whole blockchain from scratch?

@_date: 2018-12-26 18:06:30
ok. I set `txindex=1` in the config file. if I run `.\bitcoin-qt.exe -reindex` should that fix the problem?

If you click on **Copy Payment URL**, that will put the Bitcoin URL in your clipboard. You can visually inspect it and parse out the address that you need to paste into your web wallet. I understand that it's frustrating to have to do that, but I think it's a fair assumption that desktop wallet users are generally more savvy than mobile wallet users.

I maintain that this correction is healthy for BTC. looking fine, OP.
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:41:36
Gold is useful for some engineering problems but other than that I would say its main application is vanity. With the exception of these uses, BTC has all of the benefits of Gold and none of the drawbacks. Regardless what you say, Bitcoin is p2p and does not rely on a trusted 3rd party. Trust is generated by network consensus. And despite your logic, even if you fraction BTC into unlimited decimal places, there will still never be more than 21 million.

that's a good idea. I was thinking of doing something similar for my child, like paying them their allowance in bitcoin. the problem is that they are too young for a phone. I want to wait until they are in 8th grade.

Dumb question but when you buy Bitcoin with this app is it from their own supply or from some exchange?
