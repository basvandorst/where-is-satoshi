I'm just surprised it's just stagnating at this point. It's the first time there is such a trend, usually after a dip the price will keep getting higher and higher before dipping.

A link is already given in this comment thread but here's another screen I took when I witnessed it.

This. I'm posting from my second account cause I don't want to get banned. A post was banned earlier today asking about the 6400 BTC donation the top mod of this sub received 6 years ago to develop a software that was never released. Thos 6400 BTC are now worth $40M. The post was concerned with legal implications. Now it's gone.

I completely agree but why not adress it instead of removing the post ?

I would agree, but why remove it instead of adressing it ? Some people investigated and it's not like he never talked about it again. He apparently claimed to have paid some developers with it, shady things which have never been adressed.

Look I'm just asking if there's nothing wrong with it, why just remove a post that raises good points I can't even remember nor retrieve precisely because the post was removed ? I'm concerned about censorship here, I don't care about this story. I'm talking real censorship, not just the automod or people blatanly disregarding the rules.

I was there when it was rising, saw it with my own eyes. If you contact OP he might provide you with the text he wrote which was very reasonable and rational, not some kind of troll accusation.
