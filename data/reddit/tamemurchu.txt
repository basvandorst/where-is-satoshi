I disagree, fees are relatively low and the average duration of a workout is 1 hour around the same time as it takes to confirm a transaction.

If you don't see progress in Bitcoin you're not looking hard enough or you just want to shit on it...

I agree but maybe Bitcoin will help them take their freedom by displacing the government. If they can't pay for the Army to keep them in power it could lead to a regime change.

Hey, I'm really sorry about whats happening in your country but as the post states this was just a thought experiment I didn't mean to trivialize whats happening in Venezuela.
That being said I would love to hear your thoughts on a way forward. You mentioned that 'Venezuela's problems are past the financial sector' How so? 
Do you believe that it is the governments fault that the country has such problems? Do you agree with the American sanctions, I believe their plan is to stop the oil income funding the government, which 30% of comes from US. If this is the case I see Bitcoin almost as a sanction imposed by the people.
I am open to been educated, especially from people that is affected by the situation.

People of Venezuela are resorting to Bitcoin as a store of value. You mean to tell me that you would expect nothing to happen if everyone had access to a currency with longevity.
I agree some people would sell it and receive the value in Bolivar but I would expect adoption of some sort. If people went through the effort of getting a wallet to store Bitcoin before selling then they might see how easily it could be adopted, others might accept it through commerce.  
From what I have read at the start of April 800+ Bitcoins were traded in Venezuela and I believe adoption is growing. 
So I can't believe that it would have no impact. Even the start of a trickle that would one day become a flood.

If this is something that you have thought about, what way did you see the Bitcoin that was 'sacrificed', as you put it, being distributed?

Because it's centralised, a single point of authority that can be manipulated. Of course it represents something, now you're being ignorant.

Hate is a strong word, why? 
Why is it a bad idea?
 It's breaking down barriers to entry for Bitcoin, allowing people to get an idea of how to use the currency of the Internet on the Internet...

I applaud you for this.

Yes I did mean cryptocurrencies, thanks for your help there...
"The only thing". I think you're being a bit dismissive of all that is "unique" about Bitcoin and yes a lot of other cryptocurrencies have these attributes too but Bitcoin is the first to market, the gold standard and now that the second layer has been added I think any other cryptocurrency will have a hard time competing with it, with a few exceptions that have real use cases.

My comparison was more so to do with the internet compared with blockchain tech, people are investing in coins, its these coins that hold value.
For example let's take civic, the civic token will generate its value by eliminating the time it takes to ensure someone is who they say they are, this process traditionally incurs cost through  administration fees or labour at maybe $10+ per hour Civic will allow this process to be near instant, can you see where value is added here?
Bitcoin holds so much more value in the fact its immutable, its resistant to inflation, transactions are permissionless and instant (current issues on scale and transactions speeds will be solved). Your money can't be seized or frozen it's yours!
There are also companies issuing tokens that are similar to securities that will pay dividends and will increase in value on the performance of a company. Blockchain is also disrupting the stock exchange. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:39:58
If you only jumped on because you thought the price was going to go up then I think you're missing the point.
Yes Apple and Amazon produce something tangible but just because Bitcoin or the blockchain doesn't, doesn't mean there's no value there, just look at what the Internet brought us...Is there value there?
The tech is going to change everything.

I asked for thoughts... but thanks for yours very insightful... a wealth of knowledge there!

It bridges the gap between reality and digital good, it allows physical goods to be immutably registered on the blockchain, houses deeds, diamonds, birth certificate will all be recorded on the blockchain.
Nodes on the blockchain for a consensus and the chain continues with the majority of nodes in consensus, if you think that these ideas are pointless you need to do some more research...
Rewards are finite and will be replaced by transaction fees. I think you are commenting on stuff you don't really understand.

The coins hold value similar the way a start-up holds value in traditional ways.
Start-ups are backed by venture capitalist while cryptocurrency start-ups in the crypto space are being funded by the global market. The vision, team and the solution to the problem they are trying to solve holds value.
Bitcoin is being used as tender for routine transactions and more and more industries, retailers and governments, like Japan, are making use of this currency, over 3 billion worth of transactions in Bitcoin are processed everyday. 
I don't think there is a comparison between Cryptocurrency, PayPal credits or WU credit. Cryptocurrency is disintermediating them services, removing the inherent fees associated with them.
All investment is speculation. And again it's the team and vision that will create value for these new aged companies. People have tried to replicate business models and failed the same will happen with forked chains.

I can't understand that if you have been involved in the industry since 2016 and can't see the value in the industry, then to quote Obi Wan 'Well then you are lost'.

I would love to see a Bitcoin fork named Bitcoin Core. Then no one could refer to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core.

Dude why you shouting? 
There is a lot of misinformation going on and this is coming from the Bitcoin cash side... the fork in May created Bitcoin cash so why try to hijack the name and then rebrand the actual Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core?
The market will decide which chain serves the community better, it may not even be Bitcoin thats adopted world wide, although I think it will.
