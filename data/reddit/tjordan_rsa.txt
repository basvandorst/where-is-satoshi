It will become very common soon.

Everyone have been in this position at some point. If I were you, I would just look at the price less often. Long term, 9 to 15 months it will be up. Short term, no one knows

wow, which exchange was that?
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:43:55

Stop with all the stupid forks

Perhaps you should try something like ZelCore. Which generates private keys based on a username / password.
Ledger Nano can also be used. If you do not want to travel with it. Use the recovery phrase on a new device that you obtain on the other side.
Sounds to me like you are from RSA.

There should be a balance between innovation and stability.  If you do not improve BTC to keep up with the real world needs, it will be replaced with something else.

I will go and try to see how it works, I used one in Kyrgyzstan 2 weeks ago and it worked ok. Usually the issue with it is high fees.

No, it is not worth it. 45 ROI quickly becomes 600 ROI.

@_date: 2018-07-23 09:03:51
Positive for the crypto in general
@_date: 2018-07-25 06:20:16
IOTA should be a back row shit coin.
