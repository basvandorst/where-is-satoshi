Yeah, but those places only list conversions to and from USD, as of Jan 2 2016. The issue of a legal conversion to or from Ethiopian Birr remains. Not a big deal if you only need twenty bucks.

20% a year, with regular statements about how much you have "earned", is around the lower level of return required to suck otherwise rational people into a ponzi scheme. I.e. the point at which people are obsessing about return on capital and stop worrying about return of capital.

(Not a tax professional but I am taxed in several countries).
Residency vs non-residency determines which US taxes you would be liable for. Citizenship doesn't matter except in edge cases. 
If you are a small fry, and your entire legal life is outside the US, it will cost the IRS more to go after you than they may think it is worth.  If they are in "setting-an-example" mode they may not care. 
Google is your friend, here is something on taxation of non-US residents trading through US brokers:

It costs $$, but other than that, why not? The BBC had a show where the Thai police were helping an FBI agent to bust Thai citizens in Thailand (for webcamming their daughters to Americans). Busting a foreigner in Thailand would be even easier.

The Concorde was the pioneer with the arrows in it's back. Very 1950s feel to it inside. A total of 16 entered operation, 8 for BA, 8 for Air France. 16 is not a good solid aircraft run, they were effectively a large group of prototypes. In another universe they would have made hundreds, the bugs would have evolved out, generation 2 or 3 would be pretty solid.

Renouncing your citizenship is a capital gains event by itself. It's as if you sold everything for cash on that day

It's not a mistake, but it is up to you to prove that you don't owe tax in the US. There is a double taxation treaty between the UK and the US, taxes would likely be owed to HMRC not the IRS.

People start IRAs without having much awareness of financial markets and how they work. After a while the IRA grows, and then they start thinking they are rich. Or they get advice from outsiders who see a statement with six digits laying around.
There are more IRAs than people with even kindergarten levels of financial literacy. Stupidity is possible.

Which is why, after making changes to the plane, it re-entered service.
