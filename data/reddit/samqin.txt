I trust ELLIPAL Titan hardware wallet. 
Although their support are really nice people but I’m not recommending because I like them. The wallet is real airgapped and I believe airgapped is the most secure.
It’s a really good wallet but they are not around for long. I really want people to know more about it.

What I care about is that it is air gapped and for me air gapped is the most secure for my cryptos. They are doing great at the moment so I want people to know more about it.
