Bitcoin is generally unstable.  Dollars WILL lose value as long as inflation exists (which is &gt; 97% of the time).  Just think if people quit using English and quit using US dollars!
You might be on to something.  The world should go ONE month without English or US dollars!

I've read that there are some who buy and hold until it goes up 10-15% then sell.  They've been doing this for cycles.  I'ven't any clue if this is real or the price just seems to fit.
How many btc's would it take to disrupt the market?  100? 1,000?  1,000,000?  Do you think it's even possible?  What if they fuck up one cycle.  Couldn't this break them?

   Nah.  It goes up.  It goes down.  Up some more ... Some will tell you it's off to $100K.  Others will say it's going to crash to $200.  
   "Just buy more!" is another battle cry.

  This is "on paper" only.  Lost $35,000 in stocks in October 2018.  Since then it is up $60,000.  So Oct was scary but it has easily been replaced.    Until converting stocks to cash it is neither gain or loss.  
  Last year we earned about $100,000.  But our stock gain was about $110,000.  That stock gain could evaporate in a week.  Or less.  \*invest wisely\*

I'm starting to see a trend: instead of using Bitcoin, some industries are talking about using THEIR OWN cryptocurrency.  To me this makes sense.  Why would companies use Bitcoin when they'ven't any control over it?  
If you've been reading the news JP Morgan, Amazon, Google and FB (among others) are looking at having their own.  They would need to follow strict guide lines that Bitcoin does not.  But each of these certainly has the finances available to get in.  
Currently Bitcoin is the biggest and most widely known but we know how things can change within a few short years!

This is similar to a "maintenance fee" for an account less than the minimum balance.  Each account costs money to maintain.  Cashing &amp; processing checks (transactions) costs.  Banks are just looking to increase their bottom line.
Look at credit cards.  Why do people allow themselves to pay 24%?  Why not just pay the balance off each month?  Deposit money at 1% but then turn around and pay 24%.

I feel you!  This won't happen fast so the best thing you can do is study up, make the best of your time.  When i went through probate as an executor, the best thing i ended up doing was keeping in touch with the lawyer, understanding everything that needed to happen (whether or not i had to take action).  
ALL the bills have to be paid before any funds go out.  In this case, there weren't that many.  And the estate was &lt; $1M so that helped. *the bigger it is translates to "more time, more cost to liquidate".
I'm really weak on Bitcoin.  But i think you'll get lots of good help in this forum.  (Be leery what info you post/give out).
Best of the Luck to You!

Was an estate tax paid?  (This isn't on you).  It looks like you need get with an accountant and a tax lawyer.  You can read all this on your own, but before you spend any money find out how the laws are going to apply to you.  I'm sure you'll be left with a decent amount of assets.

When Btc went nuts in late 2017 it was outlandish exuberance. IOWs, a scheme of people hoping to get rich quick.  Some did.  Some lost the shirt off their back.

   When was the dollar taken off the gold standard?  Before bitcoin existed, right?  The only thing making the dollar worth anything is that someone else will allow me to buys eggs, lumber or pay any other bills.  NO ONE has ever asked me to pay ANY of my bills with gold.  (Or bitcoin).  
  My gas tank is full that were paid with DOLLARS.  My lights are on that were paid with DOLLARS.  I don't get where you come up with "dollars are worthless" when EVERYONE ELSE will gladly accept my DOLLARS.

Maybe the risk of bitcoin is &gt; that of dealing. Think about it if a kilo of blow was $1,000 one week, jumps to $20K, then you get all excited and buy a boat load but then it drops to $12K then what?  You got to pay your dealer but you can't hodl because bills can't be pushed down the road.

The internet is not necessary but it is utilized by &gt; half of the world to the tune of billions (if not trillions) of times per day.  Bitcoin is far from convenient and not backed by any government organization.  
I find Bitcoin fascinating.  I've lost money on precious metals, stocks, coins &amp; currency.  (Made some too. I'm in the positive).  But Bitcoin i'm not feeling it since i don't feel comfortable with it.
I've seen run-ups in all of the above AND remember the real estate run &amp; crash.  Real estate is very tangible and serves the purpose of "everyone needs a place to live".  I've met at least a dozen people who own &amp; maintain real estate that are still making money.

The fascination: Bc is relatively new (although money has been around &gt; 1,000 years) and i'm also fascinated with other markets.  
    I follow gold &amp; silver coins, large US currency. (made some $, lost some $).
Bc has had some serious ups &amp; downs.  (So have the other precious metals, real estate, the stock markets, etc)  Bc is the LEAST regulated.  
    So let me ask: why did all these other Bc exchanges come about?  It seems to me they just dilute the strength of each other.  I.E., their assets are spread out hence not much clout.  When Bc goes up/down the others follow closely.
    Seems like they should've stuck with Bc vice watering down everyone else's drink.
**Me make money off Bc?  I hardly doubt it.  **

How is Btc sound?  It can't hold its value day-to-day.  It gets diluted almost everyday with ANOTHER cryptocurrency.  
How many cryptocurrencies are there?  At least a thousand!  This is telling me that Btc is getting leeched off of to no end.

The articles in World Coin Index have been more "pro" cryptocurrency.  Sometimes the articles are negative but recently they seem on a positive note.  (World Coin Index is how link to this discussion board).

I go away for a few hours and Btc is down 5%.  I can't trust this place on Your own!  \*needs adult supervision\*

I collect gold coins.  Others collect electronic gold (shares).  Bitcoin is another means to collect (or spend).

How many of you use outside sources to study on cryptocurrency?  I'm ready articles that WCI offers.  Do any of you read this?  Or what else do you use?

40 hours and counting of Btc steady at $3400 (+/- $150)!

So if i buy these shenanigan-sounding "reddit coins" and then award them, will someone get paid?  Or am i just funding the terrorist group "r/bitcoin"? ☺

Buying does not cause the crash.  Selling does!

New Year (2019) says "Bitcoin won't be allowed to enter unless 2018 shows up at the door @ $4000/coin!"

In the past twelve months, Btc has declined with 7-8 bounces/temporary come-backs.  I was trying to find an actual correlation to these drops.  Since my knowledge is very limited, I'll cop-out with "supply &gt; demand".  Or investors/users are just leaving for greener pastures.  
Where is Btc heading?  Best i can say that it is still declining but not crashing.  
Of course my opinion has a value of 1/20th of one cent.  (in Btc that's 0.00000015546Btc).  
Btc will close 2018 \~ $2750. (no clue why/how!)  Currently $3210.
Anyone else?

You ran a report on "what it did".  What we need to know is "WHY did it do what it did!"  Otherwise we just plotted random numbers against time.
For instance, did we take into account the number of active traders at the time?  Even if we have the same amount they probably won't be the same traders.  Expecting bitcoin to do the same thing following a cycle (like the four seasons), i don't see why.  
Bitcoin definitely can be counted on to be volatile/never boring!

I'll guess some pulled out of BTC and put this money into BCH.  (No link required for guessing!)
\ guess: There are coin-flippers out playing short-term.  To me this is known stupid.  
\ guess: There is not always going to be a relationship between items that seem like they should.

This weeks special: Btc is happy with $3400 +/- $150!  
@_date: 2018-12-02 19:50:08
I can see no rational reason why Btc is $4,000 or $20,000 or $1,000.  So as an investment it is scary.
In terms of a currency?  The standard credit card is 10 times easier to understand.  And 10,000 times more acceptable.  
But in terms of those who believe in it - more power to them!  I find it fascinating but could not stomach the volatility.
@_date: 2018-12-08 23:20:26
Correct!  For about five months to include and jump &amp; fall-back \~ $8K.

I still can't get a straight answer to which is better: FB or G+?  (probably subjective)

Every year a few stocks are really cheap.  Over the next twenty years they will go up 10-25 times their current value.  Cool, huh?  
Well, no one can definitively know which ones.  There are thousands of blogs/forums telling us how we can get rich.  Most are full of shit.
Bitcoin hit $25K?  Could be!  If Btc goes up 6.4%/year for thirty years from today ($3850) it'll hit $25K.  (73 y/o is quite reasonable!)
