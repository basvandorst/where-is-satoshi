Good to know, thank you!

Thanks! I worried about using a bad site if I tried to do this myself.

That sounds perfect!  I’m still shocked he wants to invest in bitcoin when I have to do everything that requires a computer. He has email and that’s it lol.

Well that’s what I thought too.  There’s a bitcoin atm in Ottawa but that would involve some traveling.  Is there a website that is trusted that I could use instead?  I feel silly having no real idea how to invest but I’d rather do it my way than give someone possible access to our investment one day

I didn’t even think about the legal side of this.  I will have to check that out too, but might help my argument about not giving someone our money.

I think that’s going to be my approach with my husband around this meeting.  Don’t give him the money but find out how he did it and we can do it

Thanks for the advice if we do give him the money. I don’t think my husband even knows he will need a wallet for this. He doesn’t even have an actual wallet so this will be a big step hahaha

That’s a good idea. I’m hoping we can do that with his boss so we have a better understanding of how things work.

Thank you for this advice, I will do that today.

That’s my biggest concern is if something does go wrong I would hate to think his boss would steal from us, but I also know there’s a lot of shady people in this world and buying bitcoin is risky enough without adding another person in the mix.  I mentioned in another comment my husband likely doesn’t even know about digital wallets but his boss must so we can have him explain it to us as well.  Thanks for the advice.
