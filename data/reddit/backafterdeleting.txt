The only problem with doing this is that if you end up with one channel running on two clients, the statesmight get out of sync, causing nodes to reject your transactions of close the channel. Worst case you try to close the channel with an old channel state, causing you to lose all the funds in the channel.
If you exported the state and deleted it from the original client that would be ok, but many people couldmess up.
Watchtowers might help with this if they ever become a thing.

Nothing "has" value per se. People value things. The way to determine how much someone values something is in terms of what they would be willing to give up in order to have/keep it.
Saying something "has value" is basically shorthand for saying that there is an established base of people who value it.

The invoice is needed because of the way payment forwarding works. The receiver generates a secret known as a "preimage" which is hashed into the invoice. All the payments (HTLCs) along the route require the preimage in order to be spent, so once the final payment makes it to the receiver, they send the preimage back along the chain so all the participants in the route can finalize the payment.

There are no wallets at the protocol level of bitcoin. Each UTXO is unique even if it's paying to the same address. So they'd need to be consolidated into a fewer UTXOs eventually. Lightning is actually perfect for this.

I'd take them at face value. Someone hacks your bank account, transfers money to coinbase, sells it for bitcoin and withdraws the coins. Then the original account holder reports fraud and the bank has to cough up the money to pay them back.
Of course this is an issue with banking security. Identity theft is everywhere now because everyone has to upload their data everywhere to make a payment, and then the data gets leaked or hacked. Using data like your passport, social security number, etc is basically useless now. Before bitcoin they would just trace down where the money went and try to get it back, but now they can't.

To be honest, BCH itself isn't more of a scam than litecoin or other bitcoin forks. The only difference is the dishonest promotion of it by people like Ver. But there are real developers working on it and it has a purpose of trying things differently to bitcoin.
It will never match the robustness or security of bitcoin itself, but I'd say you'd have to delist like 95% of altcoins to be consistent with delisting BCH.

Most exchanges already have this for cases where low liquidity causes a lot of leveraged trades to get close out all at once. It happened on a couple of alt exchanges that a coin crashed to almost zero very quickly because of this happening.

Many of the altcoins have shorter block times or other mechanisms to speed up confirmation times. However this doesn't mean that they are secure. Eg litecoin has a 2 minute confirmation time, but a much higer orphan rate meaning you have to wait for more confirmations to be sure it wont be double spent.
Egually for larger block sizes, it could be that if they were to reach such a scale then node operation would centralise and the remaining nodes would be subject to regulation, leading to the alt becoming a less efficient version of paypal.

To be honest, if the BCH crowd hadn't tried to portray it as the "real bitcoin", it would most likely be semi-respected by now in a similar way to litecoin.

Some people are asking "so what?" here. Let me see if I can remember it well enough to explain:
This is intended to improve privacy and scalability, not only for complex scripts but also for regular transactions. After taproot it will be possible for all transactions to be represented as scripts so that someone analyzing the blockchain has a much harder time seeing what logic was behind each transaction. It also means that layer two scalability solutions become smaller in terms of blockchain space because most of the time the actual script never needs to be published to the blockchain.
Due to having Schnorr you won't even be able to tell how many parties were involved in the transaction: e.g: if it was a simple payment or a multisig, or something else.
It still doesn't provide 100% privacy, but it also means things like coinjoin become a lot more viable., and will be harder to recognize on the blockchain.

Personally I use Electrum as my wallet because they are very good with keeping up with the latest features of bitcoin and have a good reputation. It's also the oldest light client that's still being used.
It might also be worth considering Green Address, which is a multisignature service where even if your device gets hacked, your coins will be ok since the hacker would also have to hack green address. I would defienitely go for the "2of3" option here though.
If you have a large amount of money, it would be worth investing in a hardware wallet such as Trezor or Ledger. This is a separate device which stores your keys and signs the transactions, so that if your phone gets hacked the keys can't be stolen. It works with many wallet apps including Electrum.

Wrong. It was limited in order to preserve the properties of decentralized, reliable, unchanging money with a fixed supply and censorship resistance.
Second layer networks are proposed as a way of allowing this to be preserved while still providing cheap and fast payments, and improving privacy.
The reason the guys in Rogers tweet are proposing to spend fiat is that they are comparing this option to a coin which sacrifices the properties of a true decentralized cryptocurrency. Without this property, there is really no reason for the cryptocurrency to exist as it will inevitably evolve into a worse version of paypal.
