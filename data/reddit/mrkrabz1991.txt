This is Wozniak. Not some rich snob. First off, Wozniak wouldn't have invested initially if he didn't think it had a lot of potential. Wozniak isn't someone that cares about money (in fact he gave away a lot of his Apple shares) he cares about technology, period. So if Wozniak is endorsing Bitcoin, it's because he truely believes it in.

It's Nick with Hal's help. Hal died a few years ago due to ALS. So Nick is the only remaining real Satoshi.

My exact thought which is why I immediately got suspicious

Are ya'll aware that Nick Szabo is the real Satoshi, right?

There's no address. Here give me a sec, I'll post the pic. 
EDIT: Not going to post the pic, sorry. pretty much confirmed its fake without me having to upload the pic.

He is the real Satoshi. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:19:05
That's what I'm thinking, if he is lying, he did a good photoshop job. The USD and BTC both look like they would in the UI
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:44:42
I'm texting him and he's heavily backpedaling. He said "I don't know how it works, a friend gave me a code a few years ago and I entered it"  
*facepalm*

Please elaborate on this, I want to try to replicate it and send it back to him lol

It would still have a transaction history when the paper wallet was loaded.

You're proving it right now. Our generosity, our community, our ideals. I post about Dogecoin in the Bitcoin subreddit and get nothing but hate and made fun of.  You post about Bitcoin in the Dogecoin subreddit and you'll be met with welcoming arms. We'll even send you some. 
It's rather obvious that we have something that Bitcoin doesn't, and you're easily proving it by lashing out at my simple comments. It's almost comical.
Also, if you do some research. you'll see that Dogecoin has actually outperformed Bitcoin, by like.. a lot.

They'll never accept bitcoin. They have a deal with amex. Were a long way away before a major brick and mortar accepts bitcon. I would expect it to fully spread online before a  place like Costco takes it.

Got it! Thank you so much. My I have one miner up and running now, working on the others. 
I do have a second question though. The S3 requires 4 6 pin adapters. If a power supply I has doesn't have 4 connections available, and i'm out of adapters, could I just run it off of 2? Is running it like that bad for it? Can it damage it? 
Thanks again!

I seriously can't tell if this is a troll post or if you're just incredibly uneducated. I don't have the energy to say everything that's wrong with this post.

Awesome, I bet he's making a whole 5 cents a day with those GPU's

You right, I couldn't communicate to the S3 through the switch, which is why I had to unplug and replug back in over and over. So, can you give me a step by step instruction of how to get an IP via DHCP?
That still doesn't explain why it didn't work when I plugged it into the wall, unless it has to have a laptop connected for it to work. Correct? 
EDIT: I plugged it into a different network and I got it to mine. Yay! Now I just need to figure out how to get my laptop to connect to it over the switch so i can monitor it.

If my ROI is ridding on the value of Bitcoin going up, then it would be astronomically more profitable to just buy into bitcoin. 
That's kinda my point though. There is no point in mining. If you are expecting a ROI on mining, then it is simply better just to buy in directly.

Did "Tothemoon" seriously not give it away for anyone? They're going to start accepting Dogecoin!

Alright, this guy is full of shit. That one line about former employee's stealing is the nail in the coffin for me. If that was true, he wouldn't say. He would simply inform the police as soon as the coins were gone and they would get warrants against former employees, but that hasn't happened. So, if he stole the coins, he just simply blames it on shady employees, trying to hint that they may have taken them. Bullshit.

Was really hoping I could get someone to buy it in exchange for the profit from the machine. I think the bar owner wants it solely for the publicity. He doesn't really want to deal with it other than a place to store it.

This is clickbate garbage. Nowhere does it say they attacked every PC, nor does it mention anything about Windows Update.  Just that they had the ability to.

I view credit cards as a IOU number. You don't own the credit card number, nobody does. It's simply a number assigned to you so the bank can know how much to bill you each month.
