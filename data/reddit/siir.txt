You're just envious OB is getting all the lvoe and no one even recognizes the name of your attempt at a P2P maret
@_date: 2016-04-30 17:57:38
Well that sounds like a fine step forward, after that we can work on more steps.
Perfect is the enemy of better, they say.

 for you and these delicious crunchy ideas

hate to tell you the answer is out there since the first of Aug last year...

Well when you buy a shrimp boat, and everyone on board wants to be on a shrimp boat, but then some new guy comes in, kicks out the capitan and changes the boat into a floating roller rink against the wishes of the crew.      
That'll happen.

The joy, the coming pain, the total lack of use and utility in legacy bitcoin versus real bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:02:20
wow you saltly legacy coiners sure do seem to hate btc don't you?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:19:08
Well if the money is all that matters I don't suppose you've done any research on it and things might be hard for you in the future.

I have a business plan for opening a homebrew supply store (where you get stuff to homebrew your own beer), if anyone wants to throw in 20k we can make it happen.
But I am way too far from miami to pitch it, or even to sell bad art for btc out front
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:09:23
And anyone that looks at nullc's profile can tell he has no interest in stoping the division or helping btc

No, when you subscribe to something those pages are shown at reddit.com when logged in, when logged out you see the default 'subreddits. WHen you go to you see hot stories from subs even if you're not subscribed while you're logged in.

Here is a good example of the opinion cleansing

You and I both know that everything I wrote was true.
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:10:28
Look here: 
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:40:43
But it's been an opinion cleansing, how can there be a good debate without information?
To know your enemy you must think like your enemy think,     
to think like you enemy thinks you must know what your enemy knows

They sell them on btc talk sometimes, check it out here:  depending you can get a good price but I'd keep it or get a collection with some of the other nice physical bitcoins like kialara keyois lelana or if you like token style ones there are many options nowadays
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:05:56
Even this 'exchange rate' is based on the cost of operating the system, that is paying electricity. Which is a cost.
 
@_date: 2016-01-09 20:58:07
whoa whoa whoa, on *a* blockchain, they even said they weren't sure if thye would use btc
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:30:07
You have repeated your opinion many time, but I see no actual evidence to support it.
Keep in mind that it was the ideas presented by Satoshi that made btc popular and brought people in, it's dishonest to change those starting values.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:27:25
I've got to say, neither of those links support the narrative you are trying to push. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:31:42
Did he ever? 
When? His responses and posts were always very well sourced and reasoned. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 06:02:40


And yet not anyone can commit code to the repository. Perhaps development is far too centralized.
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:09:41

Blocks would still be made on average of 10 minutes and the max block size in no way means that is how big blocks are
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:33:54
I love it when you trolls mention this it shows you lack all critical thinking skill required to actually make decisions on your own.

schnoor, seg wit, mimblewimble, all would result in a btc where the whitepaper is obselete. Somethng many don't consider to be the 'real' btc, but we'll see what ahppens. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:25:40
Hey there, as someone who read the whitepaper in 2012 and got real excited about the idea of money that's not censored I think Bitcoin was designed to be:
 * P2P (from my private key to yours, no middlemen)
 * De-centralized (most people misunderstand this to involve full nodes)
 * Cheap (so it can be used by everyone as cash)
 * uncensored (no one can stop your tx or control who you interact with)
Since the banks began funding major bitcoin companies those same companies have started to want full blocks and high fees, limiting who can use btc and I don't like that. I want the Bitcoin that I signed up for, and it appears it's come back. I'll stick what works, and what I signed up for. I don't want radical changes like full blocks or the technical disaster that is segregated witness. Let's not even discuss how one side cannot have an open and honest debate without resorting to deleting comments it doesn't agree with. 
In short, anyone who join Bitcoin for Bitcoin and has been paying attention knows which chain is the better one and which one has the support of bad actors.

OP there is really nothing in this post that explains what you suggested it would in the title. Basically you say hard forks are too much work, and that's it.
Where is the data? Where is the analysis? This is just your unfounded opinion. All things SW can do can be done individually and not forced, plus seg wit is not in the bitcoin specification.

Morning Sir, I am curious why you added a link to the bitcoin logo.
[This]( is what I have seen from Satoshi regarding any logo. 
As to the rest I haven't finished reading it yet, it's quite long. After the first post I look forward to perusing this.

I take it you didn't bother to read the article then
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:05:47


Like, 2-7 years ago or within the last year?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:52:09
And yet more and more useless all the time. It's no surprise most people who made bitcoin what it is today, stopped using bitcoin a long time ago and moved on to other coins orforks.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:52:36
The problem is full blcosk and high fees, not value
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:29:36
Ha, this subreddit hasn't ben about bitcoin for 2 yearas
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:25:46
Oh yes, nothing to do with it's total 180 on use and principles
@_date: 2016-09-25 19:29:05
If only there was a r/ shower coin subreddit for this that wouldn't get comments banned when they mention it for no good reason
@_date: 2016-09-07 04:43:00
What is 'longer term'? Do you think, could LN be ready for use with Bitcoin in a month? Year's end?
@_date: 2016-05-19 22:36:14
wut? it *is* in the best interestes of everyone to fork at this point.. 
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:48:30
Because people get banned for bring it up as an option, so now there are few people left to talk about it and those that do don't want to be banned for discussion
