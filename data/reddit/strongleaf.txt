I'm not sure if the malware includes a keylogger and extractor for keePass. Just like what said, always assume the worst. Back up all your stuffs and wallet now while you are offline ASAP. I'm really sorry that this has happened to you. You have to act fast before any real damage happens
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:06:51
I may be sounding bias, but yes, it's good to get involved with bitcoin as a form of investment now. 
I agree with what has mentioned, and make sure that you invest in what you are willing to lose. 
The value of Bitcoin could probably helped you pay your college fee in years to come.

It depends on the exchange. If the logic and API of the exchange are hosted in another server, u might be able to use the API to trade during a ddos

If you have wallet on that machine, unplug your network immediately. transfer your wallet.dat to a clean pc and move all your coins to a new wallet. Then backup the wallet. I've not done a deep investigation on the behaviour of the malware because of my busy schedule. However, reformatting your pc will be the safest bet.

I love how it looks. Cool and awesome, makes you feel that your miner is doing something great. 
However, I wouldn't spend $200 for such case, because it will reduce my ROI for my miners.. Probably some aluminium frame will be more than sufficient.

In security aspect, a big no. In a nutshell, sticking a USB stick can potential deliver malware to the pos system. I've written a final year report regarding to this security flaw. It is incredibly easy to create a malware and exploits current USB flash drive through auto play.

The ultimate goal is to safe keep the private key in your wallet.dat.
Here's my 2 cent worth of suggestion.
I will go for the strategy of storing the coins in hardware and software form. 
Go for paper wallet, and duplication of wallet.dat into multiple offline storage device. Just like the old saying, "don't put all of your eggs in one tray", you should break up the deposits into multiple wallets as well. But not too many, as it might be hard to manage it. 
Since you are able to afford buying 1000 btc, getting a secure bank storage shouldn't be much of a financial burden for you. place the wallet files and paper wallet there. You could consider more than a bank if financial isn't a problem. 
On top of that, you could write down the public keys before safe keeping them into bank/s, so that you are able to verify your btc at your leisure anytime you want. :)
@_date: 2014-11-01 15:28:01

WARNING, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE compiled exe, IT's MALWARE!
I've found the precompiled .exe file very suspicious and I ran it through a vm to verify.
 
The program extracts qtbitcoin trader client and some suspicious executables (bridgemigplugin.exe, vbc.exe). 
brigemiplugin.exe description on task manager is open broadcaster software. After some googling, it is obvious that the program is doing a live video streaming through a open source program from open broadcaster software

Alway follows this rule of thumb
1. Never use the same password for services that can expose your personal/financial details (etc remote service, btc wallets, emails)
2. Always use 2FA if the service provides it. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:21:41
that's exactly why when a pool is reaching high hash percentage, people start to worry about 51% attack. Any chance of a 51% attack happening will cost the trust for 0 confirmation transaction.

Well.. We couldn't say that it's not possible. Nobody thought that bit coin would get to $1000 a year ago, when the price was still $20. Hence $10,000 might not be a dream after all.

come'on, leave that pool, I've already done so few weeks ago to avoid any potential 51% attack. Save yourself, save bitcoin! It's a huge issue! You don't want to see dip in bitcoin price because a double spending occurs.

They can use those information and photos to register in another exchange and do money laundry under your name.

Humm.. Thank you for giving me another perspective. I could be so involved into IT security that it narrows my views...
But let's say the cheap exchange has tons of security flaws and provides a much lower trade fee than any major exchange out there. 
Let's say one day you deposit your cash/coins, the site goes dark due to ddos. Next moment, your funds are gone. Would thousands still use that exchange?

Security, which is a niche area that is extremely important. You need to have a good server that provides ddos protection as these exchange are often hit with very high level of ddos traffic. Lots of test is needed to be conducted. Although there are tools out there that provides automate testing, many web programmers don't know how to use them. As a security student, I've seem many websites and exchanges failed because of poor security and coding practises.
Therefore $300, for developing an exchange like MtGox or Btc-e? You will probably get something that uses open source frameworks that glues up a website full of security loop holes waiting for hackers to exploit..
@_date: 2013-12-28 09:40:36
