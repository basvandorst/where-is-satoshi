Buy now. Celebrate next ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:43:49
I'm a bit worried with CME and Nasdaq futures as money can be made by "short futures" + "sell the underlying illiquid assets". I think hedge funds are buying now to fund that first big short. Luckily they will then "go long futures" and "buy underlying assset" on the way back. And on and on it goes.
In a way I see the futures mostly as a magnifying glass to volatility.
Regardless of that, I hodl forever regardless of price. Thats the only way to survive. I think we will see a new meaning to hodl in the world of futures. HODL 2.0

It took only 3k btc on market order to move price down from 11.5k to 9.3k ;) so you ofc only open the future when you know you are going to manipulate the market price of the real thing... think BCH PnD but they also have a money making future open on the side

James Altucher - the guy with cabbage on his head - is a great author libertarian and anti-bullshit anti-establishmed-routines, he's the "be responsible for yourself" guy. Read Choose Yourself book by him. Great stuff. 
He chose bitcoin now. Choose Bitcoin. Great stuff.

Respect to Japan. A good place to live. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:00:14
Yep. If you missed the news  
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:12:29
So what did he buy? :)  
Sacks: I prefer to think in terms of use cases, rather than recommending specific currencies. The most promising use cases to date are: store of value, payments, crowdfunding, file storage, identity management and authentication, prediction markets, escrow, title chains, notary chains, provenance, and supply chains. 
Looks like BTC, LTC, Eth, NEO, SIA, what else ? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:01:27
I agree mainstream media is heavily biased against bitcoins. Most of the articles they produce are laughable. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:58:43
Not anymore. It is progressing to more and more stability so dips will be yeah but smaller ones.
@_date: 2017-08-15 23:52:45
Could be. But for the next 4 months I only see plenty of good news ahead and no reason for the dip. It will just fly like crazy.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:25:08
Mhmm fair point. Thanks. But this LN second layer protocol doesnt change what BTC is! 
It is not about BTC vs Visa. 
It's about BTC vs Fiat. 
See BTC as a store of value and means of exchange. And LN is (perhaps temporary) tool how we can exchange BTC easy. And it is needed for adoption. 
Btc core protocol keeps its fundamentals. LN can be always dropped / changed / there could be 10 other 2nd layer protocols. IT IS GOOD. IT DOESNT CHANGE WHAT BTC IS. IT BRINGS BTC TO MORE PEOPLE. 
No?  
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:57:36
Exactly !! 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:04:13
Why? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:57:18
Will Segwit fix this or not? I thought yes
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:05:16
To succeed BCH ecosystem needs 2 things: 
1) Miners. They have for now. Jihan kìnda runs it all. 
2) Adoption. If nobody uses BCH why would it go up in price? 
Jihan cannot keep buying from himself forever. There is enough BCH holders waiting to exploit him. I still didnt sell my BCH from fork. When he pumps the price next time I can always sell and take money from him. 
Lack of adoption will eventuallly lead to decrease of miner activity. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 17:24:50
Yes. And mining an empty block should be way less likely without ASIC boost afaik? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:42:18
Lol. Why so much hate? The analyst forecast is mentioned to show that "even mainstream commentators / analysts were forced to go bullish" not because "you should blindly trust the banks". 
Does the range 3500 - 10k mean "it will never drop again?"  :)  You are making your own wrong conclusions. 
This is not an investment advice, it is one of the many strongly bullish views. Don't take my word for it. Read more sources and form your views (without hate towards contributors). 
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:35:53
Awesome. LN is great for BTC mass adoption and BTC price.
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:12:51
Its fine. Only have there what you can lose and enjoy the game ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:00:14
Stupid article, looks like Jihan's weak PR attempt. Especially the most hillarious part: " On the other hand, the digital currency is far from being irreplaceable, and faces increasing challenges from potent rivals like bitcoin cash."
Waste of time reading. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:06:22
Sacks: Hopefully the SEC distinguishes between "protocol coins" (which have an actual use in a software ecosystem and should not be viewed as securities) and "asset coins" (which are securities). The public policy think tank CoinCenterhas done some excellent work in laying out the legal frameworks and policy rationales for this.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:15:24
The OP is correct. I meant no offense to your statements, I agree w them. Just evaluating the quality of the message in the article :) 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:06:39
Thanks for the input. Could you elaborate on that? Which company and what implications? Is it the same as LTC LN? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:26:00
Im not sure. BTC has a utility as store of value and medium of exchange (currency). So it could be a group 1 protocol coin? 
Asset coins are the ones where you get share of some underlying assets and are a "kind of like share in fund". And are used to circumvent normal raising of capital. 
Not sure. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:10:15
Funnily it is no problem to withdraw from Kraken to Revolut :) I've done that multiple times. Receiving cash never problem lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:21:48
I love how he's worried to sound too bullish because his bosses would smack him. But he gets the message accross. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:20:50
I am addressing that conspiracy theory in step 1-3. All I am saying is that it is not an issue anymore. 
When they sold those BTC/cryptos already (step 3), there is no more downward pressure from teth possible. It's already done (last 50 days illustrate that it could have been true). 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:07:46
Yes, But Teth is a drop in sea. Coinbase had 15m users and the avg buyin per person will be some $500 so with other exchanges (Korea, Finex, Rex, Binance, Bitstamp, Kraken, ...) adding up to 50m users we are looking at 25bn inflow of USD into crypto economy. And thus the Tether issue will only do a damage of approx. 10% unless people think its a bigger issue. It is not. 
Cryptoeconomy is valued by the utility. The usefulness of combined protocols. 1 year from now we will not care about 2bn of usd that flew in at early adoption stage. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:13:14
Yes and we are down from 800bn to 400bn in last 45 days. It's over mate. We lost 50%. If the Teth scam is real it could have triggered the 30% down and the remaining 20% is regulation FUD and weak hands. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:55:36
Thanks. Got advice there that helped. Steps: 
1. Delete btc app from ledger via ledger manager and dowload it again.  
2. Delete and install again the chrome app too.
Now my BTC transactions work. 
BCH still gives failed transaction error :( its a shitcoin really... 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:15:00
Bitconnect is entirely irrelevant for price of BTC. It just creates some small fear and we move on. On the contrary it forces people to think and be more conservative with what they buy. Just dont buy shitcoins and hodl btc. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:40:38
You're right. But is it an issue from now going forward? No. 
Should they go to jail? Yes. 
Are those who bought high rekt? Yes. 
Good job regulators and after this bruising we can move up again. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:53:29
And how are people going to lose 2.2B ? In case Teth sold BTC back to cover the usdt on balance sheet it is already over. Maybe part of the ride down from 20k was Teth selling BTC to get those dollars as they knew they will soon need to show them to regulator.
Yes they cheated us all, especially those who bought above 15k but it is likely a non issue now when we are on 8k per BTC. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:08:16
Lol really? I tried being slower, wait until it shows full address or only later click confirm. Still failed. 
Is this really a potential issue? Is 10 seconds not enough wait? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:39:09
Correct. They were gradually buying and sentiment was up. Pumped with money of other people and many newbies. Then they sold. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:11:29
Your point would stand for a pure Ponzi scheme without any utility. If there was 2bn missing the run would start and last guys would be empty handed. 
BUT - **crypto economy is valued by its utility, not by pure inflows of USDs. Those USDs are just a denominator of state debts anyway, they dont matter in long-run.** What matters is that BTC and ETH will change the world and people will be using it. 
So yes there is some market drop due to the possible tether scam but at some point (now? :) ) the crypto protocols and its utility will be more valuable  to people than those dollars behind it. And people will keep assigning BTC a higher value because it is in their control, they are their own bank and all other points of crypto. 
Note also that 
- forks are not backed by USD but still have value 
- newly mined coins were not purchased by USD but still have a high value 
People should stop over-reacting. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:51:48
So what if you buy OTC to your mobile wallet and deposit it to exchange? Not worried that exchage might seize your btc if it was tainted btc? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:10:05
That is the conspiracy theory discussed everywhere - the steps 1-3 above. And I am just saying it is already over if Teth already sold that BTC and has those real dollars. 
At that stage they dont need to sell again. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:47:29
See my long reply to OP. Btc is a commodity. For example it can be stolen and reported as stolen to police. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:58:50
I did read this and think it's wrong. He says "lala btc not up after usdt issued - lalala also not up later because of Pearson something smart lalal" but the truth is if BTC was bought w unbacked tether it means BTC must be sold again to back that tether w usd. So there was the issue at some point. But as long as Tether was smart and was gradually selling to have some fiat dollars it means this drama is over now because BTC was already sold. (Big part of it last 45 days imo). 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:01:41
Yes but in illiquid market like BTC the raw buying power of 2bn fiat is huge. It can move market 50% down when it starts selling back.
So he is right. BUT my point is they already DID sell it back. So now we move up again. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 20:00:24
How did I follow AML/KYC? My cash was clean yes. 
Well OTC is responsible but I have the flagged BTC so it is my problem right? And when exchange seizes my btc good luck me talking to their customer service and prove my law.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:45:18
I think there was a case where 1. Somebody bought OTC and 2. Deposited that BTC to exchange and 3. At some point exchange seized that btc and closed his account.... 4. The guy was furious and posted here on reddit. After some time he got a clarification from exch that the btc he deposited was tainted (investigated for illegal activity) and thus they seized it after police tracked the chain... 
Simple example. Btc gets mined. Hacker steals from miner. Miner reports affected btc address to police. Police starts chasing the chain. Hacker sells OTC to buyer. Later on somehow the buyer is caught and lose his btc to police. 
Does this happen? 
How to make sure the btc you have is clean? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 11:22:29
This is bullish... 
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:37:30
Do what? Pay w BTC in visa card acceptance terminals? Likely yes. Bitwalla does it as well. But revolut has larger userbase, has no fees and is generally awesome. So Revolut adding BTC is a big thing.
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:29:41
BTC shoots for more market share. Like xx%.  The 1% example here shows initial inflow of money from Early adopters. It goes much bigger later. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:57:45
Nope. John has a bigger dick. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:57:42
So if Slush starts tomorrow it could still be done ? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:53:18
It is. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 20:53:00
Excellent article. Thanks for doing it ;)  
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:26:24
We are very close to this. FinTech start up Revolut announced adding BTC  
Thus you will be able to pay with BTC everywhere where they accept MasterCard. 
Normally merchant penetration is the biggest issue, you need merchants to be able to accept BTC. With revolut you will be able to pay with BTC everywhere where they accept visa / mastercard. Good news is that we have plenty of companies pioneering penetration with payment  terminals for visa / mastercard e.g. Square in US. Or SumUp in Brazil. And there are like 50+ companies like this trying to tap into developing countries. To equip all little merchans with card acceptance terminal. To prepare the field for digital money. 
Basically the FinTech start ups are enabling long end of merchants in developed countries with payment terminals. Once merchants can accept Visa / Mastercard everybody will be able to spend their bitcoin via their revolut card with close to zero fees. 
And in Europe just wait a few months for BTC on revolut. And be free forever :) 
Moon is close guys !!! 
@_date: 2017-07-21 22:56:57
Thx for info. Repeating is mother of wisdom. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:24:18
Thanks. It should still happen in the next period Fri - Sun then when you have slush the whole time. So not a big deal. And some extra time to buy moar BTC below 2500 before it shoots to the moon after segwit activation :)
