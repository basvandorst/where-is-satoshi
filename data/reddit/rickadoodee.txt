Its all on the [ log for 3/12/2013]( starting from the final hour of the previous day 3/11.
It was actually a clear team effort, most core devs and stakeholders were present and involved. Reading it again, the MVP award would definitely go to Eleuthria/BTCGuild, but he thanked Luke-Jr for the assist, "It's a really good thing Luke got my attention."
    00:11 MagicalTux  I've disabled the import of bitcoin blocks
    00:13 sipa  i'm mailing bitcoin-dev
    00:13 Luke-Jr  sipa: I'm trying to contact poolops
    04:07 Eleuthria  225444
    04:07 Eleuthria  BTC Guild on a roll
    04:10 evoorhees  445
    04:12 Eleuthria  It's a really good thing Luke got my attention
    04:13 gmaxwell  Eleuthria: did you get my (unfortauntely late) email? (e.g. is our list of crit infrastructure addresses working?)
    04:13 Eleuthria  I was aleady downgrading before that was sent
    04:13 Eleuthria  Remember, I'm the one who pointed out "BTC Guild can single handedly pick which chain wins based on current speed estimates."
    04:14 Eleuthria  I started prep'ing 0.7 as we discussed what to do
    04:14 sipa  you evil 51% attacker!!!
    04:14 gmaxwell  Great, good you got it. I was at dinner when this happened, and because I moved a month ago all my old awesome monitoring stuff that would have called me when 0.7 rejected the chain wasn't up anymore.
    04:14 Eleuthria  naw
    04:14 Eleuthria  I'm the elusive 32% attacker
    04:14 Eleuthria  When a hard fork hits, I can pick which one lives and which one dies ;p
Also a huge credit would have to go to the user thermoman, who first reported the error, and jouke (of bitonic.nl), the 2nd person to provide the debug logs.

Just the other day, I had the exact same thought.

that's right. sometimes people dont realize that as soon as you withdraw bitcoins from the exchange to your own address, they can never be seized. That kind of absolute security is incredibly valuable (and comes at the cost of volatility). The distributed p2p nature of the network is what provides protection, by the laws of computer code, from the laws of governments and corporations.

Well, Luke-Jr was the first one to notice the 0.8 fork and notify Eleuthria so he could downgrade BTCguild to 0.7... 
He pretty much saved the blockchain.

And what if everyone who wants to send a bitcoin first has to convert from fiat? is that a supply and demand problem too, professor?
lol I hope the quote was just taken out of context.

The metric of interest is relative growth (change in %), not absolute growth. Otherwise a $1.00 change in the exchange rate from $2 to $3 looks exactly the same as the change from $100 to $101. They are not the same, one is a 50% change and the other is a 1% change. Log scale makes that clear, so quit hatin'.

You're comparing it to the volatility of an index fund. Compare it to a single stock, or better yet, a commodity like silver or gold.

"For the most part, encryption isn’t magic. Encryption lets you manage secrets more securely, but if users are involved in the key management, that almost certainly comes at the expense of usability and features. 
That last point bears repeating: if you design a system with encryption where users manage keys, you’re going to lose features. You want gravy on that turkey? Sorry, no stuffing for you. “What?” you say. But I want my stuffing and my gravy! I want to believe I can have it all!
Users won’t accept inconvenience. Because the inconveniences aren’t small. If users are left to manage crypto keys, that means their data disappears if they lose the key. This is a mathematical certainty that makes absolutely no sense to non-cryptographers. Even safe deposit boxes can be forced open if you lose your key. The most expensive cars have unlocking fallbacks. There is nothing in the intuitive physical world that maps to the helplessness of losing your crypto key."

Only for addresses which haven't spent coins. The rest have revealed the public key (address is a hash of the pub key). Until changed, currently bitcoin uses ECDSA public/private keys, which is vulnerable to quantum computer brute-force speedup.

But everything won't happen all at once. I felt similarly in 2011, and after that first growth cycle it went on for a rather long period of correction/consolidation. There's no reason to think that shouldn't happen again after the second growth cycle, or that we'll suddenly start seeing stable rates of adoption, growth, and price change.

Oh, but it is. Why else would the design have a 21M total supply? Its more of a digital commodity (store of value meant to hoarded) than a currency.
