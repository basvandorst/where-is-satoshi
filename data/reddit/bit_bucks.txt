That's why we created our app BitBucks.  
We at BitBucks want to give people around the world the opportunity to pay with Bitcoin on their smartphones. Simply pay with BitBucks by sending Bitcoin to the phone number of a friend and it only takes a few seconds – that’s how a payment tool for the world’s best known cryptocurrency has to work. BitBucks makes this possible!  
 Our challenge is not to store large amounts of Bitcoins securely and privately, but to create the easiest tool for everydays payments. You can download the app here:[

Hey, with our App you can send bitcoins to your phone contacts - with no fee and in real time. Easy, quick and reliabe: those are the attributes we stand for. Yet, we are also big fans of Lightning:  we aim to integrate Lightning payments into BitBucks in the nearer future. The goal is to make BitBucks an even easier to use interface for Lightning and a powerful network hub providing liquidity to other participants. 
Fore more informations check out our [Website]( :) We'll looking forward to hear your feedback about our [App](
  
Best regards,

Hey LiamCodd,   Bitcoin should be as easy as possible - a medium of payment for everybody and everything: coffee, computer games, hotel rooms and so on. We from BitBucks work hard to realize this vision – because we believe that Bitcoin will make the world a better place. BitBucks is an app to send Bitcoins off-chain. Not as decentralized as Lightning, but as efficient and much easier to use.
For more informations about our BitBucks vision, payments with Lightning and recent developments all around Bitcoin, check out our BitBucks Blog on [
