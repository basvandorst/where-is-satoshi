Not sure if good or bad news.

Is that an official government site? If yes, it's huge!

From the point of view of the CC processor, it's just someone paying for another person's wish list of products.

Alright, I agree coinjar is expensive, but I will just leave with 2 points:
- There's a 0.25% taker fee in GDAX (yes, it's not that much)
- Not every citizen of every country can open an account on those exchanges, sometimes they might need to use their local exchanges that charge crazy fees.

Source? What I found was: 
You might be able to open an account from anywhere but withdraw/deposit only from the countries listed.

ok, I should have expected the downvotes, I wasn't very clear in my post about my sentiment towards bitcoin (didn't know I need).
My sentiment is that I love bitcoin, I'm actually buying more at this very moment. I do believe it has value, just not to transfer money. I think the argument that bitcoin is for poor people to transfer money instantly is a really bad one, just pushes people away from it when they discover it's not what they been told.

Spread is the difference between the buy price and the sell price.
At the moment, looking at my coinjar account: 
Buy Price: 10,571.60
Sell Price: 10,362.27
So if I take my kangaroo dollars, buy 1 bitcoin, send to you and you sell it immediately, $200 is "lost".

People downvoting you are suffering some sort of cognitive dissonance. Bitcoin is and was never a good way to transfer money. Just the spread on the exchanges and the complexity kills it.

Can you tell us what other channel did you use so I can do the same next time? I'm afraid that clicking on the X of the advert and hiding it for the reason of Misleading wouldn't do much.

Just saw another advert today, pointing to another URL: 
@_date: 2013-08-01 21:58:47
Try reloading Facebook a couple of times and the ad might come back. That worked for me until I reported the ad.

When did you place your order and when you received it?
@_date: 2013-06-09 06:03:30
Yes it is definitely a bot, check it's profile page: [

Which other currency conversion site were you referring to?
@_date: 2013-08-01 11:30:50
Can see by the URL that it's obviously not the real MtGox
