Well played. I tipped. You earned it. 
*I shouldn’t but for those that seem to care that was a 1.4 s/B fee confirming in the next block*

You run it side by side on your bitcoin node so in effect it costs nothing more.

Similar to ENS ?

Great post. Great reminder. Thank you.

What do you mean ? We can now fit 3-4 x the amount of transactions per block than pre segwit ? Block capacity has increased. 
Fees are low because estimations have improved and batching and UTXO consolidation has/is taking place. The chain is being more efficiently used. Sure a block size increase at some time in the future maybe needed but there are so many more efficiency improvements that can be made before this. 
Note: People don’t hate the idea either. There is so much more to it than a blocksize increase. Don’t fall for the small or big blocker talk. It’s just a distraction.

Open up another account. Santander or Barclays should be fine (Coinbase actually uses a Barclays account [from last week] for £ deposits/withdrawals).
Use the new account. Tell them you expect to receive a large deposit if that is out of the norm. Large movements of money are not an irregular thing. Businesses do it everyday. House purchases are made everyday etc. 
As an aside, if your investments get to millions I bet you will have by then at least moved £50-100k anyway (and bit your nails all the while). 
Good-luck on the £M. Remember, pay your taxes. No one wants to watch a bankrupt bitcoiner do bigbrother to pay his tax bill. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:36:33
Go on. Tell us how it all works then ? 
@_date: 2018-08-19 08:32:28
I think it would be to easy to fool a user. If someone changed the colours they could possibly defraud if the standard was not maintained. 
I like the idea in principle but think there are some other ways to achieve the end result that’s more universal. Just colouring the leading zeros for instance.
@_date: 2018-08-19 08:45:05
Comic Sans (ish) type font. That says it all ... 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:28:54
Because if it got any lower than that the bitcoin market cap would be less than $100B and some funds cannot invest in asset classes smaller than that.
*Note: Pure speculation. I read this on Reddit and just repeated it :\*

Congrats on the lifelong skills. Commiserations on the altcoin journey :( Travel and adventure though offer richness in another way and investing in yourself always provides a positive return !

BitMain have a warehouse full of S9s with price tags of $800 ready for shipping. Late 2017 was nearly 9 months ago or rather 10% of Bitcoins existence ago. 
Hashing reacts faster than what I think you have stated with the above in mind. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:02:46
Is this the same greenaddress as owned by Blockstream ?
@_date: 2018-08-17 18:32:34
That has actually been done. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:45:17
Replace by fee. Only works one way (up), you cannot reduce a fee if fees come down. 
As a side thought, depending in routing and how you set your node you may earn enough to cover the closing fee (?). 
@_date: 2018-08-19 19:55:29
Thanks. Interesting article !
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:42:34
I can see the infection is taking over your orange bitcoin nodes. I would cut all that pink stuff out, it could go rotten. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 06:46:48
These down periods are perfect for getting any prep work done. But don’t just open the accounts, get the limits raised etc. Trouble can be that they will want to see regular use of the account, and if you only open up and buy 1 btc and then want to sell 100btc you could still have some delays. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:19:47
Not sure where you got that from. Greenaddress is a great wallet (could do with UI some improvements). If it was the same greenwallet I’d give this ago. Just checking no one has squatted on the name.

No need for the Bitcoin (BTC) in brackets thing ? saying just ‘Bitcoin’ is just fine.

His account was hacked and that message was fake.
Satoshi mined with a distinguishable set of machines but they weren’t the only machines to mine in the early days. Who is to say he didn’t have several further machines mining and have coins moving across addressees from day 1 to obfuscate his involvement today ?  
@_date: 2018-08-17 13:48:21
Sudoku is actually the analogy that is used to explain mining by AA in Mastering Bitcoin :)
Roughly it’s hard to complete but very quick to validate a correct solution. The bigger the board the higher the difficulty. I think it’s a really good example. We should from now on call this PoS or Proof of Sudoku !
Edit: For the curious :) 
Bitcoin Mining section about half way through the chapter.

Expect ~10 days to sync. It goes pretty fast but once you get to 2016 blocks it slows right down. It’s actually pretty interesting to watch !

If I have one wallet in my tablet at home and one my mobile phone and go on a 3 day vacation and my phone dies. Can the tablet at home be used to ensure no funny business goes on and no one tries to post a false state etc ? i.e. acting as a sort of watch tower ? 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:02:11
Great stuff ! Will check this out. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:08:07
Done! 
Once you’ve done that. Put on a lightning node as well :)
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:44:34
So up 33% but down 0.6% ?

This is where side chains come in. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 18:10:17
Cheers fella ;)
I meant the next generation is going to really get the benefit with what is being built today. Our grandkids will sit on our knee and ask ‘what’s a correct, horse, battery, staple brainwallet grandad ?’, and we’ll have to tell them what we got up to and they will wonder how we even got this off the ground :)

Hold on hold on ..... Graig has 40Gb per block of willing transactions bringing $350k of transaction fees per block? He’s just waiting for the right time.  
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:58:56
Sure are. But propagation is being worked on all the time. Here is a good article.
Each node validates transactions once in a block but that doesn’t impact the network negatively unless there were so many that a node just couldn’t keep up and lose the tip of the chain. Also every mempool can be different (hence double spend at 0conf issues) due to said propagation. 
My node for instance isn’t connected to the other 10k nodes but (at this moment) 21in/8out. That may change but you can limit it etc depending on your available band width. I sometimes have to ban a few peers as they suddenly choke my network connection to a halt. 
However by running my own node I at least know my transactions are in my mempool and propagated to the other peers on my node. My node can also disconnect misbehaving nodes if it sees any funny business and I can also connect my mobile wallet to my home node. 
I’m not saying everyone run a node as that’s not practical for people but they should be able to if they want. There should be no second class citizens in bitcoin.

I’ve been using LBC for several years but slowed down mid last year. I always used the same guys who I know were reputable. I found many traders I recognised actually dropped off the radar during the pump last year leaving a mixed bag of unknowns. 
Your comment strikes home though. Whenever LBC is recommended it tends to be a last resort. There are now better options and if you are concerned with privacy then that can be dealt with other ways. If you’re just interested in buying and using coins then either bisq or Coinbase, bitflyer, Gemini, kraken, bitstamp itBit, etc etc etc. You get the point. 
This isn’t a $20-30 coin anymore. It’s serious money and should be taken as seriously as you would with anything as valuable. Heck, people spend more time to insure their $200 laptops but we will happily send btc’s over the wire to a random with no real claims process. Appreciate the guys in Iran, Venezuela etc don’t have other options but if you do I recommend taking them. The ecosystem is evolving. 
With what you said, as far as LBC goes, i’m now out. My coins are to precious and have taken me to long to accumulate to be scammed

Zoom out. Have a cup of tea. Hodl. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 08:47:50
Yes. Direct from my account to their Barclays account. Wasn’t instant but got confirmation in about 10 mins from sending. This was available to me about 4 days ago. 
It then showed in my GBP wallet. I had to then make a purchase. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:03:40
Read this. It offers some great reasoning on the topic. Very insightful.
As an aside every hash that is produced that does not solve the block should in itself be completely worthless (hence, why no one saves them). If each hash had an intrinsic value in itself then we lose the neutrality of mining. To see this imagine a billionaire paying just $0.00000001 for every hash. It may seem an incentive to ‘hash’ but it isn’t an incentive to ‘mine’. Reasoning this through you can soon see how this may cause issues with security of the network. 
There are coins that do this though. Check out folding :

The relationship between a node and its owner is a very personal and primal one. Trying to assign value to such a thing negates the beauty of it. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 22:31:27
Great question ! 
Is this for cold storage only ? A physical medium might help such as stamped steel etc ? You would somehow have to generate the keys though. 
If sending to a cold store, an address in bech32 format has built in error proofing ability but would require a suitable wallet to use it. 
Are you looking for a digital solution ? Would QR codes offer any advantage ?

@_date: 2018-08-20 06:42:42
You can request a onetime only increase from Coinbase. If you bought from Coinbase it should be relatively straightforward. I once requested a 10 x fold increase with the argument that btc had risen 10x fold and needed that to be supported. 
Otherwise the same large brokers like itBit etc. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:15:57
Thank you for your service.

Amazing. Inspiring. Never have I been more certain or excited that bitcoin is moving in the right direction.

I am going to speculate that Nasdaq will buy Gemini and start a gold rush for incumbent institutions buying up Crypto businesses.

I wonder what his thoughts on crypto today are ? Did he think this is what the ecosystem would look like with cmc and ICOs etc ?
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:25:05
They could I suppose :)
There are many reasons nodes add value to the network but more importantly add value to the node owner. Here is a good write up of one reason from a network perspective and SPV wallet perspective. 
In the main (my view) it’s about financial sovereignty and choice. If you don’t run a node then you have no vote on what chain you transact on. You are very much a customer of the network rather than a participant. There is no right or wrong way but having the choice to me either is a fundamental.
