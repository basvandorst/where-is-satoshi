nah, check out the weekly charts. weekly volume used to be MUCH higher, but the last *8* weeks (of consistently cheaper bitcoins might I add) have clocked in far lower than long term average volume (I feel like the last two weeks of april 2012 are a good ballpark for 'average volume'), suggesting we still have a way to go before bitcoin becomes interesting to buyers again. I don't know where it will bottom, but my suggestion is to not watch the hourly or even the daily charts. Unless you really and truly know what you're doing, they are useless to you. Pull up a good old fashioned weekly chart, and don't buy until you see a nice long boring straight line. You won't get rich quick but you also won't lose money quicker. 
also, major LOLOL to shiznt for his successful pump of 'BTC to 95 in a couple hours!!!". You're a true dickhead shiznt.

You seem to ignore the fact the many people consider what you call 'fiat' to be a worthwhile and much needed good/service. For BTC to be truly accepted and respected it has to be easily accepted for -all- goods and services, even the ones you personally don't like.

the same could definitely be said about you.

arguing with you is tough because even if BTC goes to 1.00 USD (which it probably will) you'll still be jacked about it. whatever. all I'm really trying to say is buying coins here at these levels is dumb, and anyone who paid more than like 20 bucks for their coins is foolish with their money.
