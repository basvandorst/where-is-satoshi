A source to your statement would be nice. If you want FUD to stop, don't contribute to it. Nobody knows what to trust anymore, and a Source to the information you share is now mandatory. It's not about deciding whether or not to trust YOU - but whether or not to trust the source of the information. In this particular case, I don't really care how much Coinbase are making in profits. But some may care. Or you might post something that I care about in the future without a Source. Please - everyone - post the link of the Source when you share information. Let's make this a common thing.
--- 
EDIT: I don't mean saying "don't contribute to it" in an aggressive way, at all. But FUD = Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. Without having a Source to the information being read is always spreading FUD in my opinion. Some people may find what they're reading to be Fearful, Uncertain about it, or Dubious.

Why this assumption?
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:54:02


I'm not sure on the timestamp of when that statement was written, but this statement was true at one point. Maybe it still stands true today. Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin and really hope it does well - as I see it changing the world for the better. However, it could be true that cybercriminals and illegal trade networks prefer Bitcoin over Fiat (USD, EUR, etc). First of all, not all cybercriminals know what Bitcoin is, and those that do know about it don't necessarily make use of it (maybe they don't understand how to use it in the first place), despite it being their favored method. 


What's wrong with this statement? It's true that it is not backed by gold or government. And it's true that some people think that it's come out of thin air - hence the use of the word "seemingly".
Also, we do not know what text follows after these two sentences. Maybe it elaborates further on these two sentences, and explains things that make more sense to you, or to other people. It's unfair to take a snippet of something and bash it. Provide us with more context (the entire page at least!), and, far better - provide us with the Source (name of the book, chapter, page, paragraph number, etc). Nobody should read a couple of sentences from somewhere and not question anything about it...
When posting something here, please always provide the Source of the content.

BTC users shouldn't have to check Reddit for the fee estimation costs, in hope of a daily (and updated) post.
Someone should make a website with the code open-sourced, that has proper fee estimation costs, unlike most wallets today. Users can then refer to it at any time they desire. Also, the community would be able to provide feedback with ways of improving the fee estimation algorithm, so that within time it would become more reliable and accurate.
Does the BTC API not offer something like this already? If not, it should definitely be implemented through a BIP, and efforts for improvements should be focused there.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:21:13
Look up 'brain wallets'. You don't need to rely on some BIP for the selection of your seed, and memorize a random mixture of words. You can come up with your own phrase, of any length. The BIPs ensure sufficient entropy so that your funds are secured. With a brain wallet, the level of security completely depends on you. I.e. if you have a predictable, short, insecure brain wallet, someone will gain knowledge of it, and take your funds. Be very careful if you are to do this.

I'm guilty of it too. I have an amount which I constantly remind myself to NEVER sell unless something catastrophic happens - such as a serious security flaw (if it's worth anything, I'm a Cyber Security specialist, and think that the chances of that happening to the extent where it cannot ever be resolved is extremely unlikely) . With the remaining amount, I'll realize some profits. If I ever make money through Bitcoin, I'll use it to contribute to this space. Word.

@_date: 2019-07-09 17:14:38
Agreed - I just didn't feel like elaborating that much. Point is, different cryptocurrencies will coexist to serve different use cases. 
Bitcoin has some technical limitations due to the security trade-offs it would cause, and for which there is consensus that this is not desirable. Other cryptocurrencies, which would have a different economical model, would be able to sacrifice security for improved efficiency, usability, or similar.

@_date: 2019-07-21 09:54:01
Depends on how much you believe in it. I believe that Bitcoin is yet to be understood by so many new people, that it'll grow much bigger than it is - we're only getting started. Because of how markets work (demand and supply), the price has to go up. I'm a big believer of BTC, so in my view, today's price is extremely low in comparison to where I speculate it will go. Lower prices are always nice, but my suggestion to you is, that if you're a believer like I am, just buy. $9k, $10k, $11k, $15k, $20k, ... they're all good buys. I believe BTC will make far bigger ATHs. But again, this is just my personal opinion, based on nothing - it's pure speculation. However, it's not based on crap either. I have a very deep understanding of the technicalities, and also the economics.

But there was probably less buyers than sellers. Meaning, for example, one individual bought from multiple sellers. In that case, I argue that saying "someone bought bitcoin" makes sense and puts focus on the one individual (buyer) that filled numerous sell limit orders.

I only learnt this stuff since dipping my toes into Bitcoin. Through Bitcoin I got to learn about so many things, such as currencies, money, markets, economics, decentralized networks, cryptographically-linked lists, proof-of-work and other consensus algorithms, crowdfunding, privacy, society, technology, and so many other things. I probably wouldn't have discovered these things in such contexts until much later in my life, if at all, if it weren't for Bitcoin.
TL;DR: I've gone deep down the rabbithole, have learnt a hell of a lot from this space, and am happy to contribute and help :) Also, thank you Satoshi.

@_date: 2019-07-09 17:04:50
I'm extremely bullish on BTC, but you are indeed wrong. Bitcoin's characteristics is very good to serve the purpose of a Store of Value - but its same characteristics makes it bad at other things. Those other things cannot happen on Bitcoin, because it will undermine its security - and since its serving the purpose of a Store of Value, we cannot take such risks, as the outcome would be catastrophic. Different cryptocurrencies, with different use-cases, will definitely coexist. And that's alright.

Public-key cryptography is more of a concept. Without public-key cryptography, Bitcoin can't even exist. 
Your research question should be towards the cryptographic algorithms which Bitcoin uses (as these are based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions; and different algorithms differ from one another with variances in their security levels), rather than 'public-key cryptography' in general.

Ideally, you withdraw the funds from the exchange to a wallet which is solely in your possession. That way only you can spend that money, nobody can stop you from using it, and nobody can take it away from you. If you don't know how to retain ownership of it securely, then you *might* be better of trusting some third party, such as an exchange, to hold your funds for you. Educate yourself as much as you can on BTC, and then when confident, move them to your own wallet :)

Don't forget Tax. Whatever percentage that tax rate is, it will apply on the inflated value too - meaning a further additional cost to the consumer. Food (the loaf of broad, in your example) is not taxed, so this comment of mine does not apply in this scenario. But it does stand true for any taxable good or service.

@_date: 2018-08-03 18:43:39


That's not good for anybody though, in my opinion. One of the things I like most about Bitcoin is that its transactions are transparent, removing trust from central institutions. 
Tether is a big institution, which offers no transparency, and which requires us to trust in it. I'm not saying it's the case - but if Tether wanted to create millions of USDT without any backing, they could. And they could use those USDT to acquire BTC (or any other cryptocurrency for that matter) at no cost. Those buying cryptocurrencies with their own money will be at a loss here. 
Why does the crypto-community support Tether, rather than fight against it?

Take a look at this article, for example:
[8 High Risk Investments That Could Double Your Money]( (just a random article I picked up by Googling 'high risk investments').
That article mentions Exchange-Traded Funds, Options, Initial Public Offerings, Venture Capital, Foreign Emerging Markets, Trusts, Bonds, and Currency Trading. Not all of these investment types are "a money producing asset [for which you would be] taking a piece of it", as per your definition. So either the entire world misuses the term 'investment' and doesn't know what it means, or your definition of 'investment' is wrong. I think the latter is more likely :)
Also, another definition for "investment" is "the action or process of investing money for profit" - which is the reason why many buy Bitcoin - and thus fits that definition. 
My argument is that Speculation is a form of / reason for Investment.

However, I too share the same sentiment as OP with regards to this sub-reddit.

Why would you want that? The only reasons I can think of are (A) the source is not legitimate or trustworthy and you want to spread false or misleading information, or (B) the source is good but you'd rather not reveal it because you don't want others to have access to the same resource you do.
Both cases are negative and either cause harm, or at best, don't help the community. When in a community, it's us members who decide how we want things to be - and the majority wins. I want to be a member of an open, truthful, trustworthy and reliable community - and that's how I wish this community to be. 
If you don't share the same sentiment as I do and prefer not to disclose the source, then you have the right to do as you please - to each his own.

I fail to understand how it is their belief that regulators have been negative on Tether due to "misunderstandings of how it functions". Yes, cryptocurrencies are extremely complicated - but seeing whether each USDT is actually backed by US Dollars is extremely trivial: (a) Determine the number of circulating USDT, (b) Check Tether's bank account's balance, (c) If their bank account's balance is less than the number of circulating USDT, then there's a problem.
Am I missing something here?

Easiest to do is: Deposit them on some exchange (such as Coinbase), go through their Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements, sell them on the market, and cash out your fiat via a bank transfer.
Also easy(ish) to do: Sell them off-chain via Local Bitcoins (meet up and do the transfer from your wallet to theirs in exchange for fiat)

BTC becomes more scarce since less coins are being generated through mining, and thus forming part of the circulating supply. 
It's positive news for those that already possess BTC since less of them will come into circulation as time progresses, which, as many people assume (myself included), will drive the price up (generally, the less supply there is, the more you have to pay for something - be it a product, service, or whatever). 
However, it could be seen as negative news for those that want to get their hands on BTC (or more of them), since, again, there would be less coins being mined, and thus less to go around.

You need to "sell" it to people. It has to be useful and should offer something new ('new' could simply mean combining existing things in a way that no other product does - it does not need to be revolutionary or entirely unique) - and you need to market it. 
Your post contains absolutely no description. You already lost me there and I closed the tab. Curiosity and the benefit of the doubt took over though - so I gave this a second chance and clicked the link (but you got lucky this time). The description and screenshots on the iTunes page did not sell it to me. I don't see any usefulness in it. What would make me use your app, instead of some other existing app / website? You need to ask yourself more of these questions.

That would be very trivial though, I think. For that, all you'd need to do is write a very simple script (create a new Segwit wallet for each existing non-Segwit wallet, and move the funds). It would obviously need to be vetted and tested, and then run securely (ensuring that the script was not tampered with after being approved). If it were this easy, it could all be done in a single day. I think 's comment makes a lot of sense though - and I agree with what s/he said with regards to why implementing Segwit could take long.

What does implementing Segwit involve, from a developer / technical perspective? I mean, how much resources would need to be put into such a 'project'? I'm just curious about how justifiable, or not, it is for exchanges such as Gemini to take so long to implement it.

I just wanted to stop by and quickly thank you for everything you've done - you're an inspiration to many. 
**I'd like to make an appeal to those of you reading my comment:**
I have made a promise to myself to contribute and donate to charity if certain targets of mine become a reality. I urge you, dear reader, to do the same. Set targets for yourselves and commit to them. Even if they sound too ambitious because of the little investments you're making into Crypto - you can always say "I'll contribute X% if my investment goes up by Y%". It's up to you to put values behind X and Y.
If you do this, you can't lose: your investment has gone up by Y%, so you've reached your desired target. You can't put a price on the satisfaction you get by helping out and making a positive difference in the lives of those people who need and deserve it the most. It's a double win.
I truly believe that blockchain technology is going to revolutionize the world and bring massive transfer / distribution of wealth (it already has). Bitcoin is borderless and is a currency for the world, with the potential to solve some of the world's largest problems. If we're lucky enough to make a fortune by grabbing Bitcoin before the masses do, please take a moment to think about and help those who are far less lucky than we are.

I'm not familiar with the concept of 'Imaginary Property', so I didn't quite understand what you meant. However, in this day and age, anybody can share anything - be it truthful or not. Without saying who / what the source is, you're removing the ability for the reader to judge how accurate the information is. When reading headlines such as "Nasdaq is open to becoming cryptocurrency exchange, CEO says" (which is big news right now), to me, it makes a huge difference what the source is. It could be completely fake, it could be genuine, it could be biased to shift the market in one direction, etc. 
These points I've mentioned here only relate to the trustworthiness of the source. There's a million other reasons why sharing the source is also important: allowing users to go back to the source and check for updates, allowing users to get dynamic information rather than static outdated information, giving credit to the author of the website, and far more which I don't think I need to list.
You have your opinion, and I have mine. We can agree to disagree. But for me personally, sharing the source is crucial.

I'm all for spreading of knowledge, open-source, and transparency. I only see good things come out of them (bad too, short-term - such as revealing abuse of power or whatnot - but in the big picture such revelations are good). For this reason, I believe it's best to give out as much information as possible, and let the people decide for themselves how much to value that information, or to interpret it. 
Restricting people's access to information (which is how I see not providing the source to the information to be) creates a bias (consciously or not) and affects people's judgement and belief. If we don't do this, we're just a herd of sheep repeating what other people say - without being able to judge or analyze the content. Providing the source also helps for accountability and responsibility - something that I believe the world needs more of. 
This is my personal opinion of course, but with this in mind, whenever I share something I always make it a point to provide the source (even when sharing something with family or friends).

Also, ICOs are new - governments had to introduce new laws for them because nothing like this has ever existed. I.e. the definition of "investment" that you have in your head also needs to be updated.
Here's a question for you, though. You do agree that ETFs are forms of investments, right? Would you consider putting money into a Bitcoin ETF to be an investment? Because it's still the same thing - an ETF... just based on Bitcoin instead of some other asset. And if you do agree that a Bitcoin ETF would be an investment - how does buying Bitcoin, rather than investing it in an ETF, differ?
I don't think you gave this too much thought.

What you're asking is what would happen when multiple currencies co-exist: would there be a single winner that takes it all, or could they both work in parallel?
Saifedean Ammous, in his book "The Bitcoin Standard", discusses this, and gives an example of what happened in West Africa, where glass beads were used as a currency there. Eventually, these glass beads became known as 'slavery beads', because the Europeans in Africa noticed the glass beads being used as currency, went back to Europe where it was trivial for them to manufacture tons of them, went back to Africa, and ended up buying everything that the Africans owned.

Exchanges can easily solve the problem you described. All they need to do is disallow people/bots to cancel an order and place a new one within a very short time-frame. That said, no exchange that I know of has implemented this or any other solution to mitigate this issue. It's pretty clear that to them, this is not something they want, or find worthwhile, of doing. If such actions are purely done for manipulation purposes, I'd be happy to see it made illegal. But again, it seems like the right moral thing to do - so even though it's not mandatory for exchanges to do something, I'm disappointed in them for not doing so to protect their customers.

I hate to break it to you, but your math is terribly wrong.
Assuming BTC's value (at the time of this writing 1 BTC is valued at $3,895.82, according to CoinMarketCap.com) and hashing power behind it remained constant (fun fact: both will change), if you earned $0.48 worth of BTC per day, it will take you 8116.29 days (approximately 22 years and a quarter) to earn 1 full BTC ($3,895.82 / $0.48 = 8116.29 days).
Not sure what you're referring to when you say it takes you 3 weeks (as per quote, above) - but you sure as hell can't be referring to mining 1 whole BTC.
I strongly recommend checking your math. Depending on the electricity bills involved in your mining, it *may* be cheaper to just buy BTC readily-mined, rather than mining it yourself.
EDIT: If you earn $0.48 worth of BTC per day, after 3 weeks you'll end up with $10.08 worth of BTC. Since 1 BTC is currently valued at $3,895.82, it would mean you'd have earned 0.00258738 BTC.

Since mining pools didn't exist yet in 2008, you must have been mining on your own. Since a block is mined every 10 minutes (average), if you were not competing with any other miner, you'd have mined 50 BTC x 4 - 5 blocks within 30 - 45mins. That translates to 150 to 200 BTC if you successfully mined 5 blocks. Could very well be the case that you never successfully mined a block, and thus never got any BTC reward.

If you create a wallet in a completely random manner, your address will be one from the many other possibilities. 
If someone else creates a wallet also in a completely random manner, they too will have an address from the many other possibilities.
The pool of possible addresses is the same for everyone. There are no registrations that take place to declare ownership of a wallet. Ownership of a wallet is simply the person(s) who own the Private Key to access that wallet.
Yes, two people CAN utilize a 'wallet generator' and in turn obtain the same Public/Private key pairs by pure coincidence and chance. There is NO mechanism in place to guarantee that a wallet is unique. You may of course always query the blockchain to check if that wallet has been used in the past - but still, it does not guarantee that nobody else has ownership of that wallet in present times, nor the future.
However, the chances of a 'collision' (the same wallet being generated twice) is EXTREMELY low, so much so that at present times it's not worth worrying about. It may become an issue of concern in the future - but the number of possible addresses is so large that I don't think we'll ever need to worry about this for a few lifetimes. If my memory serves me right, the number of possible wallets is "1 followed by 77 zeros" (i.e. 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000). But yes, the risk and chance for collision is not zero.

Yes. The chance that another wallet collides with yours is 1 / 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (again, if my memory serves me right - you should verify this).
EDIT: In reality, there is a chance for everything. What's the chances of you being hit by lightning 10 times within the next 10 days? I don't know the answer to that question - but I know that there is a chance, which is extremely low - and with current weather conditions, it's not worth worrying about. It's kind the same thing with colliding wallets. The difference is that it can be calculated mathematically.

True, they have no reason to. But they may have malicious reasons to do that, to make profits for their own customers, and in turn keep their customers happy, get more customers to invest, and consequently make larger turnovers and profits.


Yeah, if a company offering ETFs is allowed to manage their customers' funds to this extent, I think that this scenario will play out. Regulations set by the SEC are precisely there to try avoid such things before they happen - so I believe that discussing this is healthy, and is needed. If anyone has any other concerns, they should speak about them.


So, let's say the SEC approves BTC-backed ETFs, and I have a company offering ETFs to those interested. In this hypothetical scenario, my company converts BTCs for my own asset which I'll call XYZ. For every 1 XYZ I hand over to my customers, my company owns and securely holds 1 BTC in cold storage. So to re-quote what you said, my company "[has its] own assets to provide liquidity for backed products". That makes it mine to sell? I.e. when selling an ETF to a customer, I can legally ask each of my customers "Do you want us to manage your funds, such that we'll sell your assets, and re-buy at a time we believe is right, in order to try earn you bigger profits?". If the law permits that, and customers agree to it, doesn't it mean that they can dump, say, 80% of the assets they hold for the customers that agreed to the 'fund management'? To go back to the first bit I quoted, they don't NEED to sell, but a big dump can trigger FUD to other markets, causing a domino / ripple effect on the market. Of course, people would panic-sell, and whenever the company offering ETFs feel that enough panic-sellers have dumped (and consequently drove down the price further), then the company could re-buy the assets for their customers, pumping the price back up.
Essentially they'd be allowed to become a big Pump &amp; Dump company, and they'd be able to do so legally. Again, the company wouldn't need to do this, granted. But incentives would exist for them to do so: make more for their customers, earn even more customers, do the same thing on a larger scale, earn even more profits.
Both the company and their customers would make profits. It's people outside of the ETFs that would lose out, as they'd have to try to time the market to make such profits, while the ETF company wouldn't need to time anything, as they can manipulate the market and thus be sure of where things will go.
What's worse is that such companies offering ETFs can 'team up' with one another, to create an even bigger 'Pump &amp; Dump' group.
I think my concern for companies offering ETFs with the ability to manage their customers' funds in this way is pretty clear.
Is it really possible that the SEC would approve ETFs that would give the companies this power?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency - a currency based on cryptography (i.e. computer science and mathematics). I won't bore you with more details on this, as you can look it up rather easily.
Like any sort of currency, your options are to transact (buy more, or sell it) or to keep it. Selling it, for instance, can be done in multiple ways (over the counter, peer-to-peer, on a cryptocurrency exchange, etc) - and.. for each one (eg: selling on a cryptocurrency exchange) there are multiple ways of doing it (eg: which exchange to use) as well as insecure ways and secure ways.
There's a lot to learn and grasp. My recommendation is learning about Bitcoin and really understanding it. Then decide what to do, and ideally, make a strategy for it (for instance if you decide on selling some time in the future, you should set a plan and say "I'll sell X% when 1 BTC = Y USD" or something similar. Setting a plan or strategy removes emotion from the equation - an important thing to do when involved in low liquidity, volatile markets. What I'm trying to say, however, is that your question is very open-ended, and you're not quite asking about HOW to do something - but rather, WHAT to do. Decide for yourself what it is you WANT to do, and I'm sure many people here will be more than happy to assist and explain HOW - or at least point you in the right direction. Be careful though - there are many scams and fraudsters out there.
You should never trust random people on the internet - always make your own research. Nobody knows what way the market will go - not short-term, neither long-term. There are people who have been into Bitcoin for years, and still will have opposite opinions to other people who have been in the same space for the same duration. 
Full disclosure: I am highly optimistic on Bitcoin (BTC), and see it changing the world for the better. As said, you should never trust random people on the internet - and that includes me. However, since you asked what you 'should do', I'll voice my opinion: Hold it; Never ever give out your private key or seed; Until you're very confident that you know how to keep it secured properly, don't show it to anybody (I'm assuming you've got a paper wallet or something).

Sorry to disappoint you, but it's not, for various reasons... but to name a few:
* Source code is not open-source, therefore I cannot check for vulnerabilities, logic errors, flaws, bugs, backdoors, etc
* If it were open-source, I'd need guarantee that the deployed version is indeed the one available on the online repository (through some Hash value or something which I may use to confirm it)
* How do I know you won't take my BTC and run off with them? I don't. Not exactly 'provably fair' now, is it?
This is not related, but I'm curious and will therefore ask: since you just launched this, what was / were the reason(s) as to why the Wallet Address does not support Segwit?
I wish you the best of luck - but I think you're using the wrong technology for this application. The title of this post is false for the reasons I mentioned above, which either means that you're either dishonest or don't understand the technology too well (which makes me worried about the security and code of your project). 
One of the major characteristics of Bitcoin is the ability it gives for peer-to-peer transactions to happen, without either party having to trust the other. Your application does require trust, defeating the purpose of a valid Bitcoin project.

In my view, that's a terrible idea. But this is subjective - so you need to decide for yourself. Here are my thoughts on this though.
What controls your BTCs are a pair of numbers (your Private and Public Key) - that's it. He'll use software to generate that pair, and will hand it over to you for you to use. That's your digital wallet. Problem is, before handing it over to you, he could have not only stored a copy, but the presumed copy may even get compromised in either the process of creating the wallet or later in the future if stored insecurely.
*If you're new to Bitcoin, I must mention that a copy of the wallet is just a copy of the key to access the funds; you're not copying Bitcoins; Bitcoins cannot be copied, and the maximum total global supply that can ever exist is 21 million.*
Maybe he's honest, and won't abuse your trust in him and act dishonestly. Thing is, you'll never know - regardless of what that man tells you. Unless you generate the wallet together - then things would be more convincing. But even then, he can easily write some software that would record what's happening on his machine while you do that - which he can refer to later, once you're gone. Unless you use your own computer and internet connection. Point is, if shit hits the fan and ***YOU*** fall victim to some attack, resulting in the loss of your funds, you can always doubt him or blame him - regardless of the truth. I have a seemingly distrust in people, in comparison to the norm (society). If I lost my BTCs, I wouldn't want to live with the thought that it might have been some guy that took them.
I can put my mind to rest by simply creating a wallet myself. It's well worth the time to research how to do it. Plus, I can help others set up their own Bitcoin wallets, should they wish to participate in this market :)
That said, if you really trust this guy (not only to act honestly, but also to have the knowledge and capability of generating a Bitcoin wallet in a secure manner), and in the event that your funds got stolen, the thought of the possibility that it could have been him that took your funds - or whom got compromised - does not bother you - then it's not a bad idea.

In computer science, the more you allow access to things, the more attack vectors you introduce. Mining requires access to the Internet - so if the server in question was located internally and disconnected from the Internet, allowing some sort of traffic to/from the Internet for the purpose of mining alone already introduces new risk. There's no 'good' or 'bad' really - you need to balance the business' needs and security. 
I'm pretty sure that your company does not have a policy or procedure on how they can mine cryptocurrencies, though. Nor do I think they should have one. As a security professional, I would strongly suggest that secure measures are taken to detect and block mining, since I presume cryptocurrency mining does not fall under the business' strategy :). Some companies are adding notes in their "Acceptable Usage Policy" where it's officially written that cryptocurrency mining is against Company Policy. 
Also, do consider the costs associated with mining (directly AND indirectly). There's 'wear and tear' imposed on the servers as a consequence of mining, where the lifetime of the hardware will be decreased, electricity bills (servers running at 100% CPU usage will consume FAR MORE electricity than when idle). Mining is rather complex as there are a large amount of variables that need to be looked into in order to determine whether it would be profitable with your setup. Also, mining Bitcoin (BTC) without ASIC hardware is known to not be profitable nowadays. 
At the end of the day, security is all about Risk Management. Each company must see whether (a) cryptocurrency mining is something they want (and therefore allow - and if so, can each employee mine for themselves, i.e. take the mining rewards themselves at the expense of the company? or would the company keep the mining rewards for themselves? I don't see how a company that is not dedicated to mining or cryptocurrencies at large would want this), (b) don't care about and therefore have no policies for/against it (given the costs incurred by mining, they should officially state what's allowed and not allowed in this respect - if they don't, they're just lazy, or don't know better, I'd say), or (c) is something that they want to embrace and profit from, and thus form part of their business strategy (very rarely the case I'd say, unless the business relates to crypto in some way).

Not sure if I've understood your question well, but on most exchanges (I've never used BitStamp, but I assume you can do this there too, as it's a pretty core / basic feature) you can set a Stop Loss or Sell Limit Order.
Sell Limit Order: Put your BTC for sale at whatever price you want. So if you bought at, for example, $6,000 and want to sell at a 10% profit, just put it for sale at $6,600. Whenever there are buyers willing to buy at that price, your sell order will go through.
Stop Loss: You basically 'say' "If BTC hits the price of X USD (or EUR, or whatever), automatically place a sell order of Y amount of BTC for Z USD". 
I assume that this is what you want - so yes, you most certainly can using these two features.

Arbitrage is not as easy as one may think - especially if the opportunity lies within other countries.

You're missing my point. Manual processes require trust. Sure I can wait and let other people 'test it out' which I can verify on the blockchain. But what about future lotteries? Or, what if today you're doing things properly, but then a big lottery comes and you're tempted into running away with the money?
You could have eliminated these risks completely by developing a dApp with SmartContracts. Why in the world would I take on so much risk, for no valid reason? And if such risks exist anyway, why wouldn't I just register on some well-known and reputable iGaming website (non-Blockchain) which I know must comply with laws and regulations? 
You're missing my point completely. I hope you get my concerns this time round. If it took you this long to understand my point, I have my doubts about the amount of thought that went into this project. We really do not need Bitcoin nor Blockchain technology for this, and actually, using it in the way you described makes things really risky for the consumer. I for one, will definitely not take that risk.

You're misunderstanding my query and concern, I think.
What I'm asking is NOT about fraud where the company runs off with their customer's money.
What I'm asking about is whether a company offering an ETF could, in theory, and in a legal manner, manage their customer's crypto-investments to perform pump and dumps on the market.
Example: I own a company offering ETFs, and have 100,000 customers. Each customer has invested 1,000 USD in BTC. Would I be able to sell (dump), say, 50% of all of my customers' holdings (WITH their permission)? If so, that would mean that I can dump a significant amount of BTC (100,000 x 1,000 x 0.5 = 50,000,000 USD worth, to be precise). Then once the market panic-sells, the company can use the customers' fiat to re-buy more BTC at a cheaper price.
Of course this all depends on the ETF in question under review. Will the SEC be making it ILLEGAL for the companies that submitted their ETF proposals, and which are currently under review to perform such actions?

The nice thing about open, public, censorship-resistant, and decentralized blockchains is that anyone can become a miner. There's no requirements or prerequisites other than having hardware to dedicate to the task. Banks are nothing like this - so to answer her question, it's very different to a bank in this sense.
Secondly, mining is the process of conducting Proof-of-Work. Proof-of-Work is a consensus algorithm that is utilized to secure the blockchain, making it immutable. It's expensive though, as the more work goes into it, the more secure the network becomes. There's no limits to security, and thus additional Work may keep being applied. Miners could decide to put in even more Work to earn more BTC. Anyway, Proof-of-Work needs to have a reward to work, in order to have an incentive, otherwise people wouldn't do it, and no Work = no security. Miners are rewarded in two ways: A fixed reward of BTCs for each block, starting at BTC, and halved every 210,000 blocks (which is how new BTCs come into circulation); and transaction fees. Transaction fees can be considered to be the fuel behind the payment. If you want your transaction to be written on the immutable blockchain in the next block, you need to pay the price, as only so many transactions can be recorded per block. Since there will eventually be no more than 21 million BTC, miners will stop receiving BTC rewards for each newly mined coin. At that time, the only rewards miners will receive would be through the transaction fees, hence its importance - as without this, there would no longer be any incentive for miners to continue to put in their Work, and again, no Work = no security.
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:31:04
Do note that the "Circulated Supply" being tracked (such as on CoinMarketCap.com) does not factor in any lost coins. 
Thus, the circulating reply will only increase as per the specifications in the whitepaper (block reward for mining).
"Lost coins" will not be decreased from this value. So the circulating supply is theoretic. As some people here already mentioned, one can only assume the number of lost coins.
Coins can be "burnt" by sending them to an invalid address (not sure if the Bitcoin Protocol caters for this, and removes it from the mempool) OR by sending them to a wallet for which the Private Key is not known by anybody - but again, this would be an assumption.
@_date: 2018-06-15 09:03:43
I disagree with pretty much everything you said, except the last bit: "When going to a shop offer them to accept Bitcoin".
Accepting it as salary, or as a form of payment for goods or services, does not remove the high volatility, nor constant dependency of Bitcoin value on fiat.
I'd argue that you're also wrong on your note about mining. 
You're suggesting not buying Bitcoin in fiat - so here's a question for you: What difference does it make if I earn my salary or any form of payment (or a portion of it) in BTC, versus if receive payment completely in fiat and then proceed with buying BTC with that same money? 
I don't think you thought this through :) Also, I'd suggest to avoid giving advise by advising people on what to do. If you rephrased the title of the thread to read "I suggest not buying Bitcoin with fiat" I think it would be better for the community, even though I disagree with your suggestion :P

True, Bitcoin is p2p, and thus eliminates the need for a trusted third parties in order to transact. It does not entirely solve the issue of trust though.
Trust from external parties, rather than third parties, is required. The machine you're using to interact with Bitcoin may be compromised and might be feeding you false data; the GitHub page you downloaded Bitcoin Core from might not have actually been the real GitHub website; the GitHub account you downloaded from may have been compromised and the software replaced -- point is, you are trusting many external parties.
Trust, but verify - and verify you can thanks to its immutable ledger. There are many scams and cyber attacks going on though - and while Bitcoin's ledger is extremely secure - the other technologies that need to be used to interface with it are not. Unfortunately, we have to do

The USD was officially and genuinely backed up by Gold until 1973, which is when the United States officially ended its adherence to the gold standard. At least people were informed. If Tether is not backed up by Fiat, people are unaware. There's a difference.


Well, it is a big deal. I'm putting in my hard-earned money into BTC. I would not like it if some company can print any amount of Tether for no cost, trade it for BTC, and therefore get it for free. Also, those who trade their BTC for USDT (Tether) - what are they supposed to do with it if proof comes out that it's not backed by USD? USDT would be rendered worthless, and a lot of people would lose their investments. To reiterate, it is a big a deal...

2FA is exactly what it sounds like - Two-Factor Authentication. I.e. in order to authenticate, they need 2 different forms of proving themselves (the combination of 'something you know' and 'something you have' being the most common, probably). If they have both, then they can authenticate and gain access to your account. If they only have one of the two, or none, then they cannot authenticate. Half of your security is currently compromised - I strongly suggest you get that half changed to mitigate the risk.

I'm not a lawyer, nor do I know what currencies they deal with, where their company is registered, and what jurisdictions they serve - all of which are factors which determine whether their activity is legal or not - however, even if what they're doing is legal, in my view it's immoral and unethical to charge customers with the excuse of an inactivity fee, especially one as high as 50 EUR per month lol. It's ridiculous. Needless to say, I don't support companies or organization that are not in-line with my morals and ethics.

I'm a bit puzzled by your question, to be honest. Movies are generally not free to watch - as they need to earn back their costs, and ideally make a profit. If movies were free to watch, you wouldn't have the quality we do today. And cinemas or theaters probably wouldn't operate. Nor online streaming services.
The same applies to pretty much any service really - be it watching a movie (eg: Netflix, Amazon Prime, DVDs, BluRay, etc), listening to music (eg: Spotify, etc), playing a game, etc. Nothing is usually free - and those that are 'free' in a monetary sense, usually come at a different cost (eg: ads, giving up personal information which would be used for marketing purposes, etc).
To answer your question directly, their official website (refer to my main post for the link) has links to buy tickets to the showings, and cost around $20 (including all applicable taxes). So no, the movie itself is not free to watch. Not at the moment, at least.

 I agree with you. Don't get me wrong - I'm extremely bullish on Bitcoin, and genuinely believe that it's disruptive and revolutionary, and will bring more prosperity and fairness to the world.
The point I'm trying to make is that using and interfacing with Bitcoin does require Trust. Bitcoin improves matters with trust, but does not eradicate the problem - and therefore is not "trustless" in practice, although it might be in theory. That said, we live in the real world, not in a theoretical one, so I choose to give more importance to my practical perspective, than my theoretical one.

Also, you sound very confused - a lot of the stuff you wrote doesn't make sense, making it clear that you're new to the space. I strongly suggest you research and learn more about Bitcoin. That's what you want to go for, Bitcoin. Treat anything else with extreme caution. Easiest way to obtain is through Cryptocurrency Exchanges. Find a reputable one. Yes, you need to go through the Know-Your-Customer process. Otherwise, find a Bitcoin guru like myself, and have him explain it to you and sell you some himself by performing a peer-to-peer transaction.

Yeah, Roger Ver changed over time, and I too am no longer interested in whatever that guy has to say, or sell.
I remember watching a video clip (preview) of Cryptopia, where the interviewer told Roger that his agenda changed, and has essentially lied to the community. I'm curious to see what his response was.
I wouldn't miss out on this documentary just because Roger is in it though. He did contribute a lot to Bitcoin in the early days, and thus is part of Bitcoin history. Furthermore, maybe Roger isn't featured much in the documentary - so maybe there wouldn't be much cringing involved :)

Yeah, makes sense I guess, if that's what you're after. Unfortunately I don't know of any service that allows you to sell at market value at a specific date and time, even though it would be technically easy to implement. 
The only method I know of that can be utilized to achieve this would be to develop some simple script or application that would do this via an exchange's API. All you'd need to do is have it check the date and/or time once a day, and have it submit the API call to sell the specified amount of BTC (or another cryptocurrency of your choice supported by the exchange).

1. Do you accept BTC for Web Hosting, without gathering information on your customer?
2. Where do your servers reside, and in which country  is your company registered?

The value of anything, including Bitcoin, will always be valued in terms of the most dominant currency - and today that is the USD. 
The reason for this is simple, I believe. 'Easy to earn' money will lose over time, as those types of money can easily be inflated to the point where people choose to shift their funds to a more 'difficult to earn' currency, as it stores value better.
My hypothesis is that Bitcoin is 'harder to earn' money than fiat - and eventually, over time, that will be recognized, and the technology will improve to be more usable and less-complex, that more and more people will shift from Fiat to Bitcoin due to the problems that exist with 'easy to earn' money.

This reply of yours helps nobody. Have you always been happy with the purchases (goods or services) that you made? I'm sure there was a time where the answer was 'No'. 
Comments such as "Did they put a gun to your head and force you to buy their products or service? No, they didn't. Use another third party." are silly... In my opinion it would have been far better if you explained why Coinbase did things this way, or just didn't reply.

The '21 million club' is called so because only 21 million people can own 1 whole BTC (well, in reality, the maximum supply is more like 20.999 recurring; just below 21 million (because of the 'halvening' effect;). so if we're being pedantic, it's 20 million people that can own a full BTC, not 21 million.
In any case, the '21 million club' gets its name from the fact that 21 million people ***can*** ***ever*** own a whole BTC. There aren't even all 21 million BTCs in circulation yet, as around 3 million of them still need to minted as rewards of blocks that are mined. Right now, at this very moment, there's around 17.8 million BTC in circulation. In the next few months we'll be hitting 18 million. It wouldn't make sense to change the name from '1 million club' to '2 million club' and so on, as the circulating supply increases.
So to answer your question more concisely and more directly, No. The name '21 million club' gets its name from the fact that only ***21 million*** ***people*** ***can ever hold one whole BTC after all BTCs have been mined***. I.e. the current circulating supply is not considered. Furthermore, the name of the club focuses on people, and not addresses or wallets.
@_date: 2019-10-02 16:10:59
The number of addresses containing X amount of BTC is irrelevant. Addresses are not wallets, and wallets are not people either. One wallet may utilize many addresses, and one person may have many wallets too. Measuring the number of addresses that contain some amount is often not reliable to draw any sort of conclusion.

If the answer was a simple "Yes", it would mean that the price would move from what it currently is at ($8,200), to $10,000. That would be a guaranteed +21.9%. If it were the case, it would be obvious to everybody that they should grab BTC below $10,000, and that would push up the price instantly. And then it would instantly crash at $10,000. Anyway, I hope that this post of mine makes you realize that asking such a question is pointless.

Upvoted for visibility. 
This technique allows anybody to prove existence of data at the time it was recorded on the Blockchain.  
In theory, if I have a digital image, video, or any other type of data, I can obtain its Hash value, and have that recorded on the Blockchain.  
If done properly, in doing so, I have evidence that the image, video, or other type of data existed at that time.
For a more practical example, I can take record some footage, obtain its Hash value, and record that on the Bitcoin Blockchain.  
Because Bitcoin (BTC)'s blockchain is immutable, it can serve as evidence to prove that the recorded footage existed at the time its hash value was recorded on the blockchain. 
This is very powerful, and should not be taken lightly.

Bitcoin, as a protocol, doesn't care about anybody's personal information. In a nutshell, to make a peer-to-peer payment on the Bitcoin (BTC) network, Nodes on the Bitcoin Network would need to confirm that you actually have the coins within the sending wallet, that a valid wallet address has been specified as the recipient, and that you have the coins to pay the fees for the transaction to take place.
That's pretty much it. Bitcoin will never ask you for ANY information, such as your email, work, or home addresses, your name, or any of that crap. Regulated companies, however, due to legislation and regulations, must collect that information from their customers. This is a regulatory thing though - something that politicians and those in power demand. From a technical perspective, one can make peer-to-peer payments on the Bitcoin blockchain without ever submitting that information to anyone.

Serious developers should ask for your CV too. If you can't speak the language, you won't understand a lot of the technicalities, which you must - as decisions must be taken based on numerous principles, depending on what you want to achieve. You need to develop things with a number of things in mind: such as scalability of the project, security, performance, user-experience, etc. If I were to work on a project, I wouldn't want my name to be associated with a failed project - even if I earned $3k in the process.

Well, politics cannot be avoided, unfortunately. Luckily for us, through its decentralization, Bitcoin (BTC) cannot be stopped. It can only be forked. My worry is that people will be 'brainwashed' and misled into believing what those in power want them to believe, as they have sufficient resources to do so. Education is key here - but it's a fight between us in the crypto-community, against them. They have a massive edge in terms of resources, while we have an edge because our currency is far better (in my view, of course). As more people learn more about it, more people will hop on and spread the word. Early investors, as always, will be rewarded (assuming it will take-off - which I believe it will). 
Regulation isn't 'Good' or 'Bad'. There's a wide scale - certain things can be good, while others are bad. Plus it's subjective - what I consider to be good, you may consider to be bad - and vice-versa. For instance, I agree that ICOs should be regulation to some extent, and that con-artists, scammers and fraudsters should be punishable by law.
1 BTC is indeed 1 BTC. But what can you exchange 1 BTC for? At the time of this writing, 1 BTC is around $6,600 - so you can exchange your BTC for something around that value. You can't exchange for a house worth $300,000 or whatever, because if you could, people would convert $6,600 into 1 BTC to buy a house at that price. Anything and everything will be measured in Fiat because it is the dominant currency. Until that changes, you cannot expect the fiat evaluation to go away. Ever. 
I believe that mass adoption will happen within time. Fiat and Bitcoin will co-exist in parallel. Maybe some day Fiat will die, and will be replaced by a Government-controlled cryptocurrency (which will be extremely bad for humanity, as every single transaction will be recorded - right now we have some privacy with cash, but with a government-controlled cryptocurrency we would lose that). Bitcoin will run in parallel and will be used by people who want more privacy than fiat / government-controlled cryptocurrencies (in the future), or want to be their own bank, don't want their currency to be inflated or controlled, or want some other advantage that BTC offers, which other currencies lack (government-controlled currencies will lack these characteristics purposely to retain control and power). 
@_date: 2019-10-31 17:54:28

Bitcoin did not lose one of its core strengths. Bitcoin itself was never hacked since its creation. What was hacked was cryptocurrency exchanges, where hackers steal the public &amp; private keys to a wallet. The vulnerability here sits in either the user or the exchange, and they were exploited. With security awareness, implementing good security hygiene, and taking your coins off the exchange and being your own bank, you'll be protected. The Bitcoin protocol has proven to be secure so far.

Blockchain is torrenting? Why do you say that? I know a lot about Bitcoin (or so I think, at least) - but close to nothing about Torrents, hence why I'm asking about this.
In Torrents, a file or files are divided into 'blocks', allowing you to share fractions of the file while not having the whole file. It works peer-to-peer and is decentralized. However, in torrents, one block does not depend on the next, unlike blockchains - making them completely different from one another.
But Blockchain is more than just that. The next block is cryptographically hashed and used in the next block. You therefore need the entire chain to mine / verify the next block. This concept, as far as I know, is the  core component of Bitcoin (and Blockchain), but is completely new, has never been done before, and is part of what makes Bitcoin (and blockchains) so revolutionary. It's one of the most critical characteristics to making Bitcoin immutable and offers non-repudiation. 
The blockchain is very different to torrenting, I believe.

It is indeed a way to make Coinbase rich (through their fees). But at the same time, they're facilitating the process for people to spend their BTC at places that do not accept it directly. It's a win-win, I think. However, in the future, I do wish BTC to grow and gain further adoption, and see businesses accepting BTC directly. It will happen, I think, but it needs more time. This is nonetheless a step into the right direction for gaining adoption, I would say.

Fair points - and yes, I agree: I do have unrealistic expectations on what it is to be "trustless" in practice. Hear me out though.
Trust may not be required in theory, but it is required in practice. I'll answer this in two parts:
1. **Knowledge:** There is insufficient time for a single human being to learn all of the technicalities that together make up Bitcoin. Furthermore, developers from all over the world will continue to develop it further, making it even more impossible to catch up.
2. **Technology:** Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer network of Nodes. Like all software, nobody can guarantee that Bitcoin's code is free from a 0-day vulnerability (a software security flaw that doesn't have a patch in place to fix the flaw). Yes, we can get the entire world to look at the code, but despite nobody finding anything wrong, it doesn't necessarily mean that it is indeed flawless. You therefore always have to trust that the code will not allow anybody else to move (steal) your funds. Also, assuming you have all of the technical knowledge required (despite being impossible - refer to (1) above), while you may fully understand how, for example, TCP/IP works, you still need to trust that your Internet Service Provider (ISP) will properly route the traffic for you. You depend on a number of technologies, and dependencies imply trust.
Don't get me wrong - I'm extremely bullish on Bitcoin, and genuinely believe that it's disruptive and revolutionary, and will bring more prosperity and fairness to the world.
However, while I believe in the concept of "trustless" in theory, my distrust in people doesn't allow me to believe that it can be achieved in practice. As much as I love Bitcoin, for me it's not "trustless", simply because to me, nothing in the world is.

It's a hobby for me - I truly am interested in this area, and am happy to dedicate a lot of my time to it. I got a Bachelor's degree in Software Development and immediately found a job as a developer where I spent 1 year. I then moved on and did a Master's degree in Cyber Security. I've now been working in this field for the past 5 years. I've got a number of certifications such as the CompTIA Linux+, Network+, and Security+; Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH); and a few others. I would actually like to shift my career towards working within the blockchain space in the near future. I feel like the path I am on fits really well with the prerequisites of what it takes to work in the field of cyber security with a serious blockchain company. I feel like I am prepared for the job. I don't know how old you are - but I would recommend the path I took to others.
In short, you really need to know the fundamentals of the technologies. Understand networking at a low-level. Understand software development and programming in various languages. Understand regulatory requirements and how the business or organization must comply with them. Understand how implementing security at a company affects the culture, and the business. All of these combined, and you cannot go wrong. You can also dig deep into one specific area, such as software development, if you wanted to.
I hope this help you out in some way. Best of luck to the both of us :)

Every asset that is available on the free market sounds like a ponzi scheme. Think about it.
Forget about Bitcoin if you don't believe in it - and imagine a Digital version of Gold that you trust, is stronger and more secure, global, decentralized, etc. It's value now will be less than it would be if it gains traction and people start to use it. Replace 'Bitcoin' or 'Digital version of Gold', with whatever you want - the same stands true. Look at Gold in the past - was that a ponzi scheme? Look at stocks for Microsoft, Google, Apple, or whatever - is that too a ponzi scheme? All investments look like a ponzi scheme. And yes, some fail, and some bubbles pop, and that could happen to Bitcoin too.
Bitcoin is a new asset class. People don't know how much to value it yet. Also, if this thing gains traction, more people will use it, and the software will be improved. Anyway, if you don't properly understand Bitcoin, or don't see a use for it, then don't buy it.
I used to try to explain to my friends why Bitcoin matters for a couple of years now, but very few seem to get it. Thing is, the country I'm from has a functional economic system - or so they think - and thus don't see why Bitcoin's needed. I'm past that, and now I understand that it's not really worth the effort to try educate those who do not want to be educated. They'll understand sometime though.
I'll end with this quote from Satoshi Nakamoto:

You're interpreting search engine keywords literally. 
Searching for "bitcoin founder dead" does not necessarily imply that those searching on Google using those keywords literally think that the founder of Bitcoin has died. 
Keywords are just that - keywords. If I knew that the founder of something/anything that is related to Bitcoin has died, I would try searching for recent articles using those exact same keywords.
I thought this was all obvious, but apparently it's not.

With Revolut, all you can do with regards to cryptocurrencies is buy them, and sell them back to Revolut. You can do absolutely nothing else with them. You can't transfer your BTC to someone else to make a peer-to-peer transaction, and you cannot pay at a store if you hold BTC, and have then automatically transferred to your country's currency. 
So no - you cannot "use Revolut for that, with lower fees".
With regards to Transferwise - I have never used or even heard of it, and thus cannot comment.

I might be wrong, but I don't think I am. 
You can trade it. You can spend it. The only place you can use that £100 is not just on that specific website. You can withdraw it. You can give it to someone else. Most websites of this sort allow you to transfer the BTC to a wallet address of your choice, making all of these things possible. But true - it's not your own Bitcoin when it's on an exchange.

I too will be doing something similar in the near future - launch a website in attempt to try share knowledge and education.

I also wish to dedicate some time to some Bitcoin-related DIY projects, and share tutorials + code on how to do it, etc.

All bitcoin transactions on the blockchain are final-settlement, meaning that said transactions cannot be reversed, modified, or deleted. In other words, you can forget about recovering your funds. Sorry :/
EDIT: Also make sure that you never, ever, use the wallet from which your funds were stolen. Otherwise it's safe to say that any deposited funds will be stolen again.

Buying from Coinbase will not generate any transactions on the blockchain. Coinbase will sell you from the stack that they already have. Even if they didn't have a stack, they'll negotiate a price with some third party - possibly a miner, and will most likely buy in bulk. They're not going to be buying BTC separately for every $10 purchase made by customers. Even when Coinbase adds the funds (in BTC) to your account, it doesn't even touch the blockchain then. This is because an official movement of actual Bitcoin does not even need to happen yet. Not your keys = Not your Bitcoin, and up to now Coinbase hold them for you. The Bitcoin can continue to sit in their wallets for now. Remember, you are TRUSTING Coinbase with your Bitcoin. That trust (and Risk that goes with it) can be eliminated completely by withdrawing your funds to a wallet that only YOU have the Private Key to, and thus can authorize transactions from.
It is only when you withdraw your funds from Coinbase to a wallet of your choice where a transaction on the blockchain is actually made. Contrary to before, the Bitcoin actually does need to move. And that movement needs to be recorded in an immutable manner, so that the receiving wallet can spend it. 
Oh and by the way, please be more diplomatic to a fellow crypto-enthusiast. I was considering not correcting you, and letting you make a fool of yourself - but my desire to educate prevailed.

He meant Market Capital - not Bitcoin's value.
According to coinmarketcap.com at the time of this writing:
* Bitcoin's Market Cap = $134,217,482,718; 
* Ethereum's Market Cap = $34,302,736,646; 
* Bitcoin Market Cap / Ethereum Market Cap = 134,217,482,718 / 34,302,736,646 = 3.91; 
* Conclusion: Ethereum's Market Cap is approximately 1/4 to that of Bitcoin, at this moment in time.

Link to source-code? If it's open-source, this is the single most important thing ... yet you failed to mention it?
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:25:03
It depends on the level of detail you want to get into, and how willing the other person is to listen. 
For example, is Blockchain and a Database the same? No, very far from it. But to someone who has no technical understanding, you can start off by saying "It's like a Database, it stores data, but it's not like any other database that we've had before". If the other person replied with "so it's nothing like a database" - then I can't quite argue against them.. it's true, from a technical perspective, it's nothing like a database. But by explaining things this way, the other person begins to understand it. Of course, this 'explanation' is just the very tip of the iceberg. The more willing the person is to understand it, the more differences they'll start to understand be aware of. 
Here's another example. If one asks "Where is Cyprus?", one could reply by saying "It's close to Turkey, just below it!". You could argue "Just below it?! Are you crazy?! There's like 50km of sea separating them!", and you wouldn't be wrong. But as an initial explanation it's pretty good. Again, the more willing one is to learn, the more we can get into the differences. But yeah, start by explaining the closest thing they can relate to, and know of, and then get into the differences to elaborate further. You gotta start somewhere.
When one says "Bitcoin is like Gold", you have to note the context and perspective, depending on how the person explains it. If one mentions those 3 points you listed, then one should understand that we're strictly talking from an economical point-of-view.

It is like Gold in the sense that it is a store of value. In the same way fiat "is the same as Gold" in that it can be used for trade and commerce, and somewhat as a store of value (but a shitty one due to inflation). The phrase 'is like Gold' can be interpreted in many different ways - there's a whole spectrum of definitions is could have. We're not saying it's identical, but it is the same in some ways, i.e. similar. That's why people keep saying Bitcoin is like Gold, and will keep saying it. It makes it easier for most people with zero knowledge of Bitcoin to begin understanding it from an economical perspective - as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:42:59
Yes, agreed. This is why low volume can influence the price a lot, giving an 'inaccurate picture' of the market.

If it is indeed better, it would be adopted. Tell your friend to publish the source code as open-source. Write a converter from mp3 to his algo's format, to facilitate conversion and thus adoption to the less technical people. Make it easy and effortless. Then, if it is indeed superior, it would get adopted. The market decides, and through the openness it can get an after-life and develop into something different by other people. I think (a) your friend's algo isn't superior to mp3, (b) he tried too hard to profit off it, or (c) had a superior product but did shit with spreading awareness of it and marketing it. (C) is kinda hard to believe though.

I've always found (ab)using statistics when they work in one's favor annoying, and it skews the real picture. Why not show the statistics for all months of the year? You can still claim that "Bitcoin outperformed S&amp;P 500 by 3.61% in October", but at least it doesn't spread misinterpretations and lead people into making false assumptions. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying your statement is wrong or incorrect - I just dislike the way you sent your message across to other followers of this sub-reddit.

Bitcoin is better than Gold, to me, and to the Bitcoin holders. As awareness continues to spread, people who at present times don't know about this 'better than Gold' thing (Bitcoin) will then know about it, and may turn into a hodler. 
On the note of Gold, I see the argument that 'Gold is a tangible asset that has many uses besides a store of value' to be very weak and misleading to readers. What else is Gold used for? Jewelry? Technology? Art? Right, but look up the statistics of these uses, and you can see how Gold is used pretty much just as a store of value.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:45:35

3 quick points:
* My guess is that Satoshi's keys will NOT be the first to 'crack', as the world would realize, lose faith in BTC, and probably quickly sell all of their coins. This is not in the interest of the 'cracker', of course, and thus is not the method I believe they would take.
* There are wallets pertaining to Exchanges that have more funds in a single wallet than Satoshi, I believe. Thus, 'crackers' would have more incentive to go after such wallets.
* Like anything else, Quantum computing can be used for both good and bad. Quantum computing can be used to secure the Bitcoin network further, as well as to attempt to 'crack' some Private Keys. For this reason, quantum computing does not worry me.

I think you misunderstand the concept of hashing, and how it can be used. If the hash of a file is on the blockchain, timestamped to have been published there back in 2010, then it can be used as proof that whatever the data is, has existed at that point in time.
This does not solve any problem by itself, but it gives us new opportunities that weren't possible before. Sticking to this same example, in a world where publishing data's hash values on a decentralized blockchain is common practice, gives us the opportunity to re-run the same data (video, in this case) to generate the hash, which will be the same as that publicized on the blockchain, whose timestamp is trustworthy. That is all the technology can provide at this point in time - it is then up to us as a society to come up with policies and procedures to reach conclusions or actions based on this evidence.

If the current Circulating Supply is 16,933,212 BTC with a Market Cap of $148,023,196,687, and the price of 1 BTC is $8,741.59 (these are the current values as of right now, as per CoinMarketCap.com), and I buy 1 BTC at $1 more than the current market price (i.e. $8,742.59), then that effectively means that I pushed BTC's price to this new value for all BTCs in circulation. Wouldn't that mean that all 16,933,212 BTCs in circulation is now worth that much? I.e. I bumped up the price for BTC by $1 for all BTCs in circulation = an increment of $16.933 million? This of course sounds like way too much, so I'm pretty sure my math is wrong. Can someone help me out on this? :)

The title is deceitful and inaccurate. Rabobank are not announcing a crypto wallet. Please follow the same process with any news you read about Bitcoin, because people are misled into believing news articles way too often, in my opinion.
Don't take me wrong, I'm a true believer of Bitcoin and really would like to see widespread adoption - but only for the reasons I believe in. Having people buying in because they were misled is not one of my reasons.
Validating what the title says:
1. Open the URL linked (  )
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click the link where it says "More info on the Rabobank site" (  )
3. If you know Dutch, read the damn article
4. If you don't know Dutch, like myself, get it translated. I've used Google Chrome's built-in translator for this
5. Understand what it says. Most importantly (quoting the Google translated text): "The idea of ​​Rabobit is a cryptocurrency wallet within the online banking environment." and "There is no official decision by Rabobank to introduce this yet."
TL;DR: For now this is all just an idea of Rabobank, and there is no official decision for its introduction. Make it a habit to always check what the source says - at least for headlines that you believe could potentially be big news.

What I meant in my previous comment is that over the long-term, these are not really important, as people will eventually learn (some the hard way) and such companies / forks will die out. Once people become more educated on Bitcoin this will be less of an issue.

Stating that Binance is the "World's Biggest Crypto Exchange" was Bloomberg's choice as per title of their article. However, it may indeed be the largest in the world by Trading Volume. As I write this post, based on trading volume for the past 24hrs, according to CoinMarketCap.com, Binance is  with $2,550,209,883 total trading volume, with BitMEX at  with $2,765,930,000. Source:

Here's a thought that will probably blow your mind, as you don't seem to be able to think of this possible scenario, so I'll help you out:
A rich person owns a lot of stocks in numerous major companies; they also own 10 houses and have a lot of fiat in their bank account(s). However, this rich person has little to no knowledge in economics, finance, and any other field of study which is directly or indirectly related to money. This person is rich simply because they inherited the money.
Hopefully this hypothetical scenario makes it easier for you to understand u/MAssDAmpER's statement at calling you naive for not understanding how rich people are not necessarily money savvy. 
@ u/MAssDAmpER: Apologies if my thinking is not in-line with yours, though I'm pretty sure it is.

The guy has €200. Buying the Ledger Nano X (or even S) from that €200 would be too costly. Plus, you need to be somewhat tech-savvy to be able to use a hardware wallet. 
If you want BTC purely for gambling purposes, with a relatively small amount of money, whilst accepting the additional risks that come with not owning actual BTC, then buying from Revolut is not too bad an option, in my opinion.
If you're serious about BTC and really want to own a piece of that limited 21 million BTC that will ever go round, then I'd suggest buying it off an exchange, or if none are allowed in your country, by finding someone to sell it to you directly - and then have them moved to a secure paper wallet. This option requires more time and dedication - but if you're serious and want to securely own BTC, this is mandatory and crucial.
Good lucky buddy.

While I am optimistic on Bitcoin, and am a true believer of it, you should keep in mind that Bitcoin may indeed fail. It is an experiment after all, and nothing is guaranteed. I believe in the tech and and have faith that it can revolutionize the world. I don't believe in people so much, and believe that us humans may kill the experiment - either unintentionally because the majority of people don't understand it (though this should be a short-term problem, as once knowledge gets out, it's out, and there's no way for people to 'unlearn' things), or intentionally (by continuously finding new ways to manipulate the market to profit from it, by banks and governments wanting to retain control and power, etc). Nothing is certain, and this is why the cryptoworld is very volatile and speculative. I'll keep investing in Bitcoin because I truly believe in it, though.

Yes, I do. But uses that are not used in practice are for the most part theoretical. These uses are actually used in practice, but the use of it being a store of value outruns the rest by far. So, it's basically the store of value aspect that determines the value of gold, for the most part.

's comment is valid in my opinion. What s/he said (it was pretty clear to be honest, and I don't even know why I'm going to explain it, but anyway) was that selling on an exchange may have been easier to do than OTC, considering the large number of BTCs that he wanted to sell. Or maybe he just wanted things to be done quicker. Care to explain why you responded in the way you did?

If we're being nit-pickers, and talking about placement, I'd argue that the rocket is extremely far from the moon right now. This conclusion can be reached by comparing the size of the rocket with that of the moon - they're almost equal in height. Therefore it's just the 'angle' at which the picture is set (the rocket being far closer to the 'camera'). :D

I didn't read the entire thread, so I apologize if what I'm going to say has already been mentioned or discussed even. But you're assuming that the miners sell their mined coins at a constant interval, no? I.e. at the end of each day, they sell X% of their newly rewarded coins to cover their costs. But maybe they don't do that. Maybe they sell at ATHs to cover their operational costs for the next month, or so. I don't think there's a "one rule fits all" that all miners follow. Each have their own different strategies. PS: I am not a miner, and have little understanding in this area.

BIP = Bitcoin Improvement Proposal. This is not a suggestion to improving the Bitcoin Protocol, and thus wouldn't qualify as a BIP. This is merely a suggestion on the unit users of the Bitcoin protocol use when communicating. This isn't a new suggestion either.

True, but if "20 year old PCs" were capable of mining, a mining farm would still have tons more of computational power. You can attempt to mine Bitcoin using the first version of a Raspberry Pi - it will 'work' in the sense that it's possible, but the computational power is too low in comparison to the entire mining power being utilized, that attempting to do so is infeasible. In short, it's simply a war of computational power. But this is how Proof-of-Work (PoW) works. To solve the problem, to the best of my knowledge, you'd need to change from PoW to something else - such as Proof-of-Stake (PoS). But even PoS isn't a good solution in my mind. With PoS, the more coins you have, the greater the returns you get. So you solve the problem that comes with 'centralized mining', but you create a new problem due to 'centralized wealth' (I'm sure you know that is a very low % of wallets with a large % of Bitcoins). So, to my understanding, yes - there is a problem with the way mining works. And yes, the community has acknowledged this. And yes, they're looking into ways of solving the problem (eg: PoS is being looked into). But nobody knows of a proper solution just yet. Everything I've said is based on my own research, and may be inaccurate or false (as any other piece of information you find on the Internet, in truth). So do keep in mind that what I said may be inaccurate or just false - but at least it is my honest opinion and understanding right now. If anyone thinks otherwise, please do reply to this comment. If you've got links to sources to back up your statements, that would be great :)

You either need to sell them on an Exchange, or you can do it in person. I believe you'd rather do it via an Exchange at the comfort of your own home, especially since 100 BTC is a huge number today. You must know that not all Exchanges do trading with Fiat (USD / EUR / etc). I don't know how informed you are, so I'll say this just in case: USDT (Tether) is sort of the 'crypto' equivalent of USD (and the company issuing them should have the equivalent in USD - but whether or not this is true is another story, and not something that will help you with your question). So - what I'd suggest you did was register to some Exchange that accepts Fiat - the only two that I know of are Coinbase (GDAX really - their trading platform - I've used this a lot so I can guide you if you need help) and Bitstamp (never used it). Dealing with Fiat (depositing or withdrawing) will require ID Verification due to KYC / AML / CTF / etc. Do that (you'll require uploading of your National ID Card, Passport, or Driving License). Once you do that, you can place sell orders, either at Market price, or at a price you set (Limit order). Sell your BTCs there, and you'll have your USD in Coinbase / GDAX. Then, the final step is to have that USD withdrawn to your Bank account - probably via a Wire Transfer. That's pretty much it. Feel free to post back with any questions you might have :)

Believing something doesn't mean it will come true. I believe in BTC and really wish that it succeeds - but it doesn't mean it will come true either. Being a believer in BTC does not mean that one needs to go All-In. There are many strategies believers can choose to adopt. This guy's strategy is to buy more on dips, and not sell when s/he thinks a dip is coming, as BTC is not very predictable in this volatile market. So - in the same way you're asking him/her to sell because they believe a dip is coming, I'll ask a similar question to you. Why don't you sell all your assets, convert the fiat you make into BTC, and re-sell that BTC at a profit, then re-buy the assets you had sold? Happy to take that risk, even though you believe in BTC? Your statement is childish in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:43:16
I agree with what you've said, except that you're making it sound like it all revolves around Bitcoin, when in actual fact the last 2 points relate to the underlying technology of Bitcoin (Blockchain), and not Bitcoin really. The uses-cases for blockchain (in that it's decentralized through a peer-to-peer network for safekeeping of the distributed ledger) are huge (and as somebody correctly mentioned, some of the uses-cases are unimaginable right now). Here's a quick image I found off Google by searching with the keywords 'blockchain use cases': 
That can give you more ideas for you and your friends to brainstorm and have intellectual discussions about :)

Apologies for this presumably stupid question.. but how does the blocksize affect the global blockchain size? To my understanding, X number of transactions can fit within a Block. A block is mined every 10 minutes, meaning that X transactions can only go through in those 10 minutes. This is leading to a long 'queue', causing a kind of bottleneck whereby the network is slow in processing said transactions. Increasing the blocksize to say, double the amount, means that now 2*X can be processed within 10 minutes = faster transactions. I don't want to ignite a flame here - so I don't want to discuss SegWit2x and its pros &amp; cons and whatnot (other threads on this already exist anyway). 
My question is... whether it's one big block holding 2*X transactions, or whether it's two separate blocks each holding X transactions ... isn't the total amount of data equal? I.e. how does the blocksize affect the global size of the blockchain?
Honest question by a Bitcoin newbie. Please be soft :)

The way I see it is that with fiat you've got different units: tenths (1/10), hundredths (1/100), thousandths (1/1000), etc. With Bitcoin it's no different, in that here too you've got different units: Bitcoins (1/1), millibitcoin (1/1000), satoshis (1/100000000), etc. There's nothing wrong in my opinion. If you're going to go buy something worth $0.50, with fiat you'd say "50 cents"; with Bitcoin you'd say "5 satoshis" or something.

Yep, precisely so. I have absolutely no problem with the world being able to see an address of one of my wallets  sending or receiving funds from some other address. You, or the world at large, can totally monitor that to ensure that all transactions satisfy the consensus rules of Bitcoin. Not only is it perfectly fine from my end, but I'd like to encourage as much people as possible to actually do this.   
Run Bitcoin nodes, have a copy of ALL transactions that ever took place, continue to validate new transactions that take place, and continue to monitor things so that Bitcoin can grow and become more secure :)
What's is NOT fine from my end, is to force me to give up personal information, or information on what wallets and addresses are mine.  My life experiences have shown me that I cannot trust governments, corporations, or institutions with this information.   
Sorry, my trust is gone - and I don't want to listen to a bunch of words either. Actions speak louder than words - a lot of actions need to be done for me to regain even some level of trust. With BTC, I choose to trust the code (which I believe I have a strong understanding of) and not people.

5 comments saying "Yes", but nobody explains the reason behind it. Spread knowledge, guys :)
The 'halvening' (halving of the block mining reward) happens once the block number reaches a specific number (every 210,000 blocks), and is not based on time. Therefore, the quicker blocks are mined, the quicker we reach the 210,000 multiple of the block counter. This is also why we can only give an estimation as to when the next halvening will happen, as opposed to a precise date / time (continuous variations in randomness, hashpower and difficulty all make it impossible to pin-point when exactly the next multiple of 210,000 blocks will be mined).

While the percentage may be on the decrease (assuming this is the case), the resultant values may still be on the increase. If inflation is +1.6% this year, +1.5% next year, and +1.4% the following year (thus decreasing each year), the resultant inflation in terms of USD (or any other fiat currency) may be larger, since percentages are compound, not linear. I.e. 1.6% of X may be smaller than "(1.5% of (1.6% of X))", implying that the rate of inflation is still increasing.

I am very much against establishments that either abuse their power or that do not give equal opportunities to people (which is pretty much all of them, to some extent) - so I think we share the same love for Bitcoin and excitement with seeing how this revolutionary technology will cause disruption and change the world for the better. 
I kind of agree with your thinking though, so I don't blame you for replying in the way you did. But anyway, I'm not here to convince you - we can both spend our time doing far better things that actually make a difference, rather than argue. 
The way I'd like for Bitcoin to gain adoption is through education - by spreading awareness and having intellectual discussion that are open, public, permission-less, border-less, and censorship-resistant - just like the way Bitcoin is. To me, images such as this one degrades the value of Bitcoin and what it's about, and does not educate people or provide any value - it only creates hype which leads people into investing for the wrong reasons... which is why I find them damaging.

I didn't say you blamed the Bitcoin protocol - I merely stated that you were the weakest link in safeguarding your BTCs - which makes my statement correct, based on what you've said.


You were the vulnerability that was exploited, leading to the attack being successful - so yes, that makes it your fault. If I receive an email from an unknown sender, asking me to download and run some program, and I do that, resulting in my machine getting infected with malware and giving complete control of my machine to the malicious actor - then technically it's my fault, as I was the point of failure.
Social Engineering, Phishing, and Malware are scams that target the end user, rather than a technical flaw.

Depending on what you say. But after being an active member here for almost a year, sadly I'd say it's true. This forum (as well as many others) are censored - and if you post something that they disagree with (such as this topic, most likely), then they'll have it removed. 
This is not a good thing - open discussions are healthy and needed.

Thanks for the links. In my opinion, they're just articles spreading FUD. Yes, the US Government can ban Bitcoin if they wanted to - or could at least introduce laws or regulations that make things so difficult to use, that people would be put off - like KYC and a ton of crap. This does not worry me though. I think Bitcoin has reached a network effect that is irreversible. Too many people know about it and its benefits now. Those people will keep spreading awareness, and more adoption will follow. Yes, the US can try 'ban' it, and short-term it will cause problems and price drips - but long term, I can't see Bitcoin failing. Just my own personal opinion of course...

Not really. We don't understand how the pyramids were created at the time that they were. At this day and age, in 2018, we could technically create more pyramids, but we'd use advanced methods.

Calling people to be a fool if they invest in anything (be it Bitcoin, Gold, or something else) while having debt is silly, and something which I disagree with.

Transparency is good, and we need it. Not just to 'defend against this attacker', but also to earn people's trust that no abuse is happening. I am a big fan of BTC, and not a fan of BCH. I once created a new topic to ask a very legitimate, honest, and genuine question, and a moderator deleted my post. Sure, I won't rule out the possibility that I was at wrong, and I give them the benefit of the doubt - I still come here after all. However, that made me lose trust in the moderators here. Transparency eliminates this problem of (dis)trust, and prevents the possibility of abuse in the future too.

The information here is false (2015 didn't see $1000) and biased (following the pattern, 2018 should be $100000, but instead 2018 was skipped and 2019 was placed for this price tag). Very disappointing post for various reasons...

It's "your fault" because you fell victim to an attack, which in truth could have been avoided. The 'flaw' is in you due to either lack of knowledge in computer security, or lack of good security practices. Us humans are vulnerable since we're naturally flawed (we fall victim to Social Engineering attacks, etc). In this case, you were the vulnerability that was exploited, rather than a vulnerability in Bitcoin's protocol.
@_date: 2018-04-07 20:17:57
What makes you so convinced? I'm guessing the recent news and headlines. Do you seriously think a wise investor is going to announce to the world "Hey, I'm going to invest in &lt;fill_in_the_blank&gt;!"? If anyone did that, and the world listened, and bought in before he was done investing, it would drive up the price for him. This is the opposite of how investing works. We all have our opinions though - you stick to yours and I'll stick to mine  :) Good luck.

Wow, chill dude. I did not mean what I said in a rude way, and re-reading it again, I still don't think I was rude - my message was just misinterpreted from your end. I apologize nonetheless.
To elaborate further, notice that I put "your fault" in inverted commas. By that I meant that although it's not directly the end user's fault, but in some way / to some extent, it is. Here's another example for you: if some malicious actor had to ask you "What is your mother maiden's name?" and you provide them with that information, then the malicious actor has a good chance of resetting the password to some account of yours (thereby gaining access / ownership to it) by abusing the "Forgotten Password" functionality since this very same question is often used for this. If the user did not give up this information, then they'd have been safe. If they fell for it, it technically is their fault though - in the sense that they were the weakest link, and thus where the vulnerability lies. The end user him/herself was the vulnerability that lead to being exploited and rendered the attack successful. 
This is a form of Social Engineering - which by the way, is the top information security threat. People are naturally vulnerable to such attacks because we often Trust and don't Verify. Security Awareness Training mitigates such risks . 
The intent behind my post was to try raise awareness so that they'd be more security-conscious and vigilant; and not to offend anybody.

Well, I would certainly want to make sure that all citizens are aligned and will work collectively towards the same goal. Also, I'd want quality - not quantity, and thus would only grant citizenship to those who want to contribute to the crypto-currency revolution to change the world for the better - for everybody, and not just us citizens of this digital country. Apart from being a citizen of the country I was born in, I consider myself to be a Global Citizen - a citizen of the world. I am not interested in things that only benefit me, or a handful of people, at the expense of others.
I do not have any requests at this time, as too little information has been provided. However, the only requirement for me would be that all citizens work in an ethical and moral manner. I think that citizens should focus and spend most of their efforts working together to spread education and awareness on Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-12-22 14:53:36
No; they're completely different. Hardware wallets do the signing of transactions so that your PC/laptop, which very well may be compromised without your knowledge, wouldn't need to. Using an external hard disk, your computer does the signing - which if infected, could result in the loss of all your funds.

The more links and channels are connected to BTC, the better. It may not be useful to you, but it may be useful to some other people. And, if it's not useful now, it may be at some point. So yeah, the more options are available, the better. More integrations is progress towards adoption.

I get what you mean - I believe I understand Bitcoin pretty well, from both a technical and economical side. I agree completely with all that you've said, but I might worry more than you do on the following point you made:


As per my reply above (to I worry about a successful social engineering attack on Bitcoin, by those in power (political, financial, or otherwise - even Bitcoin whales). I get that obtaining 51% attack from a Node-perspective will be extremely expensive, most likely unfeasible and not viable, and still limited in what they can do - as the 49% may continue off supporting the chain they believe in (as what happened with Ethereum Classic). Bitcoin is technologically extremely difficult and expensive to attack. However, from a social perspective, it may be far easier and cheaper to attack (by using the media to spread FUD, provide misinformation, etc) - and this is what I worry about. People are more vulnerable than strong cryptography. Thus, steering 51% of the Bitcoin community into believing whatever those in power want us to believe, would be more effective attack than an attack on the network through 51% hashing power. Bitcoin has already undergone such types of attacks. Hopefully the truth will continue to prevail. Long live Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-12-22 20:01:12
Yeah that was pretty darn good. Although I think he's making some assumptions that I may disagree with. For instance, new wallets are typically created with each new transaction. Wallets are thrown away after a single use. In theory Bitcoin could get attacked by a brute-force attack, before because we're quickly abusing of the address space, which we think is so large. We might not be right.
We thought IPv4 would give a big-enough address space - but we underestimated the technological growth. What if Bitcoin grew so big, so fast, before proper scaling improvements could take place, and before consensus among the community could be established - that security couldn't be maintained, and that people would then be able to access other people's funds, rendering Bitcoin a failure. It's all an experiment, and nobody knows how things will go.

Everything that's "new" is first known to a few people. Adoption comes later. Those who get in early benefit most. I acknowledge the fact that it kind of sounds like a ponzi, although it's not. This is true for any precious metal and company stocks - as the prices are driven by the market. Small market = small money. Big market = big money. If the asset is limited in supply, as is the case for Bitcoin, then of course those who want to buy later will struggle, and thus need to buy it at a higher price.

It's pseudo-anonymous, not anonymous. Saying that it is "not anonymous in any way" is false, however. 
True, all transactions are fully transparent on the Bitcoin ledger, but no information on the user's identity of those involved in the transaction is required by the protocol, at a technical level. So yes, Bitcoin does offer some anonymity, but only to some extent.

You replied in a post I submitted here, so I checked your very recent posts, and this one caught my attention. I share the same sentiment as you - I think BTC will remain horizontal throughout 2019. I do however think that we'll see new ATHs in 2020, and if not, most definitely in 2021.
Why do you think BTC will dump in the coming 3-4 weeks? I'm curious on what you're basing this prediction. It's nice to hear other peoples' thoughts on how the market is going, and where it's heading. But to be honest, receiving proper, informative answers is very rare. I'm curious to hear your honest thoughts though, if you're happy to share them.

My worry is that even though the address space is so large today, it may not be large enough in the future. Mass adoption will increase our wallet-usage exponentially. Again, remember that new wallets are used for (typically) each and every transaction. We use our wallets once, and throw it away. The larger the network, the more transactions happen, and the more wallets are 'thrown away'. 
If we (the community) realize that this may become a problem, we may change the algorithms to utilize even larger numbers, solving the issue.
My concern, however, is the address space being utilized at rapid speeds, such that the problem is not fully-resolved before we, the community, can agree on the way forward to solve this problem.
I know that the chances of my worries turning into reality are very low, but if we're to build a completely new financial system, we need to think about the worst case scenarios.

Counterfeit  Bitcoin = any other altcoin (including Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV). You're right - nobody can send you counterfeit bitcoin. If someone tried sending us Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV, our miners will notice it and discard the transaction. 
All miners combined, we've got the world's largest super-computer. All of them protecting our payments network and distributed ledger. Bitcoin *is* the fastest and most secure payments system *right now.* 
But I do think that the technology currently lacks for mass adoption, and thus we need Layer 2 solutions. There will be a point (a number of them in fact), I believe, where the technology will lack efficiency for the demand that comes in, to a point where people stop using it, driving the price down, as what happened in 2017. 
But then we'll fix it - Layer 2 solutions will become efficient , reliable, secure and user-friendly, and thus can scale to cater for the previous peak of demand. We'll have cycles of these, resulting in bigger bubbles taking place. 
I think we'll continue to hit barriers, and we as a community must continue to fight and take them down. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and thus will be very different and far better in the next decade. This is the beauty of open-source code with a large enough community to make it grow. Seeing how Bitcoin adapts for improved Privacy will be interesting.
