How does shapeshift.io solve this issue?curious because the math involved buying alts or trading from 1 coin to another is  mind-boggling for me and scares me away from even trying. Shapeshift solves this? And how?

Ah... you're right. that's more common than twice monthly. I hadn't thought of that.

No. Its not the 15th or 31st. Paydays today are the weekly ones, which is far less common.

Hi.  I would like multiple exchanges to choose from also, as all my eggs are kind of in one basket right now. Is there an easy and instant way to swap money or ETH from GDAX over to poloniex or Gemini? Would I need a hardware wallet for this? Thanks.

So how can I best get around my bank charging me an international fee due to coinbase POS being outside of the U.S.?
P.S. PNC Bank sucks.

No help.

No I am not. Mine show up similarly, then a few days later I got an 11 dollar international POS fee. Still not sure if it's the bank though, because when I ask PNC customer service if there's a fee for international purchases they say 3 %. However, 11 dollars is not 3% of 300. So idk wtf. I got fed up with trying to explain crypto currency to bank employees and moved on to GDAX. I know there's a solution.... Anybody?
