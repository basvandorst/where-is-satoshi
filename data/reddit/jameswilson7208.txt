You are looking for coins that were mined in 2013 and want to buy them for $100 per coin? Yep, got 'em!

Even with free electricity it won't work the way you think it will.
Find out how much the system with 1 GPU draws. If it is close to 500 watts you are done, can't add GPUs.
Edit: and you can't measure it with GPU idle, needs to be full load.
@_date: 2017-12-14 02:36:01
Still got 'em. Mined in 2011. Not interested in selling for $100. Make an offer?
Edit: Have about 8220 from 2011+2012, the rest are 2012+.

If you don't know the math you could catch something on fire. The gauge of cable before the Y, gauge of Y, the load of GPU on cable, the load of system, the output of PSU, etc. If you do the math you will have your answer if it will be safe or not. I would suggest don't do it. I hate to rain on your parade but it ain't gonna work, free electricity or not. But good luck to you sir.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:55:45
It's just math man. Not safe to run Y cables anyway but with low power (&lt; 100w) it may work in a pinch.

You will lose far more money on electricity and replacement CPUs that you will burn up  than you will gain from mining BTC on a CPU. If your goal is to overheat your CPU/PC you are doing things right.

How exactly will multi-sig help an exchange and protect an exchange user?
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:03:09
Reasonable argument, well put. But...would you assert 8 connections are 8 votes or 1 vote? Put aside core/thread count. Will 8 P2P connections provide a count of 8 or 1? I assert 1 (assuming 1 core/instance/thread) regardless to the connection count.

@_date: 2014-03-10 02:26:45
The issue with these stupid arguments is that folks include USD or another store of value to equate value to Bitcoin. Remove those other stores of value and the argument falls flat on it's face. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, it does not need USD, CAD, EUR or anything else to function. It has value (to me and others) because I can go down the street and exchange my BTC for a tank of gas or a pile of groceries. What the counter party does with the BTC I just exchanged I could care less, I got my gas and groceries.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:47:23
It's not a matter of whether you can Y your PCIe power cables, it is whether your GPU draws more than 200 - 300 watts alone, you have to leave some power for your main board/etc.
This becomes moot if you are trying to mine BTC. You will burn up your GPU and CPU long before you make any money mining BTC with a GPU or CPU. Don't do it is my recommendation.

yep, I get that, that would be of benefit to an exchange. I just don't understand what benefit there would be to an exchange to use multi-sig deposit addresses for users. Doesn't seem too useful to an exchange except for maybe cold/hot transfers.

September 2010, parse the blockchain and come back with some valid data. You may forget that it was common to move 100k of BTC around back then.


Again, 1000x in value related to what?
I can't help you pal. I had a hard enough time convincing my father-in-law who is an economics prof at a well known uni that trade between two parties should be only between two parties...once he got that then explaining Bitcoin made much more sense.

I suspect you took a photo of a QR of either one of the BTC addresses in your QT address book or a QR of one of your receive addresses. If either of those you are out of luck as those are just your BTC addresses and not your private keys/wallet. There is no such thing in QT as a QR of a wallet or private key.

If you are asserting there are not enough coins to satisfy population needs then yes divisibility has everything to do with it. If you are asserting that population can't afford coins because Bitstamp quotes ~$640 a coin today you are clearly misguided. Remove $640 and all other units of value from your equation before making such assertions.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:54:26
I think you are on the right path. I would advise to keep on top of your good/services and keep offering those to the Bitcoin community. If there is value there they will come, if not, well I suppose you know how that will work out.
I always encourage folks to denominate in alternate currency only, but I understand the hesitation and no blame for those that can't right now.
I think one day you will exchange in an alternate currency exclusively (likely several) and it will not be a fiat, but that is just my opinion. :)
Good luck to you!

Mark didn't found Gox.
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:46:07
yep, that is the discussion I was trying to get into and understand. It seems to me that for this to work the exchange must cover trades made by the user until another party (user or third/escrow) releases the 2nd of 3 which would not be instant.
@_date: 2014-02-12 01:54:35
And they still have a xss from a few weeks ago
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:15:24
That sort of makes sense, but wouldn't the exchange need to have substantial trust in the third party in order to even permit trades from balances in such a multi-sig wallet? If an exchange has no control over deposited coins why would they permit trades with those coins?
I'm not arguing with you, just trying to understand the benefit to the user and the exchange.

Total market cap related to WHAT? Investment needed to cover it related to WHAT? USD? EUR? Corn? Wheat? Holy Jesus.
When you remove the relation to something else which you are accustomed to (USD, EUR) and instead look at Bitcoin independently it changes your equations entirely. That is my precisely my point.
How can you reliably predict that in 20 years (or 2 years) that the world population will use USD as the reserve currency? Care to make that prediction?
I get your point, I argued similar in 2010 when someone tried to sell me 40k Bitcoins...fortunately, and after a few weeks I bought them.
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:53:29
BS is absolutely correct, 8 out. You can easily modify bitcoind to make more (see ~pn_seeds) outbound and allow more inbound. I can get 400+ connections within a couple hours with a modified bitcoind and 1000+ if I let it run for 24 hours or more. Doesn't help anything or anyone except myself for data collection/latency. My client validates transactions just like a single full-node would with 1 connection.

For immigrating to America you sure have an extraordinary grasp on the language/grammar. Good job!


Wrong! Prior to AB129 and subsequently when it passes the CA Senate, sales of goods and services are NOT required to be in fiat. Vendors can refuse payment in currency other than fiat pre/post AB129 but there is absolutely no law that exchange of goods and services MUST be in fiat...and in my opinion there never will be.
Yes, I get your point of denominating your products in fiat, kind of defeats the purpose of selling products in an alternate currency though.
Many/most vendors do the same as you, it is risky to think that you can't get a gallon of milk for your family if you sell a good or service in an alternate currency. But if nobody takes the step forward then it will always be fiat.
I and many others accept crypto-currencies exclusively for all goods/services and while it is extra effort to buy milk, to me the effort is worth it.

Each full-node bitcoind instance votes on whether a transaction is valid or a double spend or not. It is indeed a consensus and likewise a democracy because if there are not enough votes a fork will occur.
# of connections != vote count, period. One CPU (instance/process), one vote. 24 instances (processes) = 24 votes on valid tx.

One more time, are you sure about that? Try it and get back to me. I am open to being incorrect, but I have put some time into the core client. I don't think it works that way. If you can generate or direct change destinations then Bitcoin is broken.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:49:27
Yep, but there are many retailers who don't want to spend the time understanding it all like you are doing and are willing to pay a middleman...where there is a need someone will fill it.
Also yes, as it becomes more widespread there will be more attempts at fraud but at the same time the technology will improve as well. There will be a point soon (IMHO) where once a payment propagates across X number of nodes and you see it (I estimate 1 - 3 secs) it will be yours and safe.
Watching the improvements since 2009 are what assures me that the above will happen...but continue your research until you are confident yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:34:52
Again, are you sure about that? Did you manually generate the change address or direct which address the change goes to? If you did then you likely use a non-standard Bitcoin client. I don't believe that is the way change works. News to me if it does, but I would hedge it doesn't. bitcoin.pdf

Likewise no "registration" is required to send Bitcoin. I don't consider the announce to the network that you are transferring ownership to another private key as "registration".
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:38:21
are you sure about that?
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:27:38
In the near future there will be a Bitcoin payment processor similar to your CC processor you use now who will accept Bitcoin payments on your behalf, subtract a small fee and forward payment on to you. They will hedge their fees collected against double spends and fraud so you will be guaranteed payment once it hits the network from them to you. And they can't charge back (you) if there is a double spend/fraud.
Of course fees will be relative to transaction amounts and volume, but it is a business model that makes sense for small'ish transactions and larg'ish volume.
I don't know if Bitpay or the others do this yet. I was going to implement this a couple years back but been too busy building systems for other people instead of my own.
But yes, the risk of accepting a double spend is so substantially low that you could easily accept network notification as approval on your own and still be way ahead against CC merchant fees even if you caught a double spend. Assuming these are $20 - $50 purchase.
