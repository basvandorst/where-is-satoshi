The monopoly of Visa during big events on large area like the Olympic Games is annoying and must be fought with Bitcoin.

I'm running full node for lightning network so I totally agree with you.

You don't see it the original way it is supposed to be. It is supposed to give more means to the more promising projects.
When bcash is up, it is because it is more promising because transactions are faster than bcoin for exemple. Faster transactions can be seen as wealth.

Yes. But what could be seen as wealth for the project team is not the case for everyone in the world. It is way more complex than just "faster transaction implementation". For some people, Segwit2x is priceless and is the only possible future for bitcoin. For others, they won't put a dime on it. At the end, traders decide what they want to "subsidize" or in what they believe will go to the moon. By deciding, they create the wealth where they want.
It's hard to admit but when bcash appears at a 0.1 bch/btc rate, a lot of money appeared from nowhere. Bcash was created by programers, but its value was created by traders (almost nothing of the real world was for sale at the time in bcash).
I don't say traders are bad or good. I just recognize a bit of their utility even if a majority of them just wants to earn money and doesn't care about the bitcoin technology.

I think bitcoin price is reacting badly to the 9000 gifs propaganda. So it will come back again and again !
