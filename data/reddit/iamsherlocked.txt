Are you Bre Pettis? You sound like Bre Pettis

That's exactly what he would say! Bre Pettis is the CEO of Makerbot. You really do sound like him. Here's a video of him speaking on the Colbert Report:

I'm a bit confused about coinsetter. As others have mentioned, you can't deposit or withdrawing USD, so what in fact are you doing when you are buying and selling BTC, as shown in the third screenshot? 
Do you deposit BTC into coinsetter, and then you sell it and the value is displayed in your account as USD at that bid rate? Then do you buy BTC back at the ask rate later (hopefully making a profit) with the USD listed in your account? Once you are done with trading, you can only withdraw in BTC?
If that's how it works, it seems pretty convoluted, and something maybe they're working on to get depositing and withdrawing of USD. Also, if that's the case, it seems that they're considering BTC as something like a stock, and not like a currency. If that's not how they operate, can someone clarify for me. Seems like an interesting platform none the less.

Is there a different rate between $50 and $200? I guess if you're doing wire transfers, then yeah, that $10 flat fee will take out a whole lot, but seems to be 1.49% regardless of ACH transfer amount. Let me know if there's something I'm overlooking.
