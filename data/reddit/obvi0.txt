Well, I'm looking to diversify, not be left holding hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.

Just because I'm dressed to be raped, doesn't mean I deserve it.

I'm bold, if not smart.  That's how I roll.  I'll try not to confuse your explanations with support.  ;)

Done, and done.  Anything to *actually* add to the discussion?

It would be counterproductive to not have evidence of income.  That's why I've kept my day job.

Thank you.

In my book, the state hasn't replaced God yet, so I'm feelin' okay.

There is still a hole somewhere in there, where you're paying tax on the property post-facto on its evaluated market price.  Still working that angle.  But in terms of taxable events...  That's my thought.

I've looked into an LLC, and it actually looks promising - however - the money has to have come from somewhere.  You can't just incorporate an LLC with assets and not have a paper trail.
I would think a cash or Bitcoin based business would be the way to go, if you're hiding things in that manner.

Heh - I'm shocked this even lasted an hour.
Other things I have been looking into:
* Buying high-value items for cash, and selling those via Craigslist.  Looks like firearms may soon be a possibility.
* Looking to convince a for-sale-by-owner landowner to sell me land for Bitcoin off the books, with an accompanying significant discount of USD on the books.
Any other ideas?

Have them sign over the property at a slashed price - there's nothing to say we didn't negotiate something $50+k in my favor, with that amount of Bitcoin being slid across the table off the books.

Thank you.
OP will post if picked up by IRS, let you know how the whole Tor -&gt; VPN -&gt; Wifi thing worked out.

I have the life that I carve out for myself.  What cake am I eating, exactly?  Is this the "you didn't build that" argument, or the "who will pay for the roads" argument?
What country would you suggest?
If I post on Reddit through Tor, and the IRS somehow catches up with me, it'll be great news for Tor AND all the bootlickers that are chanting "tow the line."

Accruing thousands of Bitcoin and never spending them seems silly.
I have more than I can use, at the moment - I want to realize my gains.  
Before anyone asks - no, not through anonymous feel-good tips to random Redditors.  :P
