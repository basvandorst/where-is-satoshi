Bitcoin will not fall into either system.  
Capitalism and Communism became competing ideas in an era of double entry accounting money and commodity of labour.  Before mass communication, labour specializing and obviously  Internet and it's Magic Blockchain Money.  
Money is a medium.  Fiat money has delay, error (aka fraud, inflation, censorship), and is point to centre topology.  Bitcoin is immediate, zero error and peer to peer messaging.  Which will perform the role of money better?
The false dialectic of Central Banking Communism vs Central Banking Capitalism will be evaporated by this new medium just as newspapers and broadcast video have been decimated by the Internet.

Actually no.  Your money at the bank is legally a loan to the bank.  It is not settled until you close your account.  The credit and debit updates are immediate and you can use them but they are reversible without your consent.  Bitcoin transactions are settled in a bearer instrument manner after a few blocks.  
Bitcoin is not a bank.  You are looking at it as if it is.  Bitcoin is a trustless digital bearer asset.  Scalability is of no importance in comparison to trustless.  You probably were not around for the SegWit Bcash debate.  This has been settled.  The value is in trustless not in scale.  
But Bitcoin will scale.  The technology of scaling is already being done with databases and networks for fiat.

Yup.  There are few ICOs worth anything but for an underlying business that actually has merit, an  ICO is a great way to get equity financing.  Like them or not, there are a few that actually have potentially valuablevbusiness models.  EOS, prediction markets coins, shared computing resource coins.  
Private Key as ownership is a lot more effective than shareholders agreements to enforce equity rights.  Although there probably will require paper and court jurisprudence for many types of business.

Gold is money. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:46:02
Well, a system that uses Bitcoin as a base layer for money and Bitcoin IOUs as currency is far far better than either a gold promissary or a pure fiat system.
Bitcoin is trivial to authenticate, both it's veracity and quantity so a currency doesn't need to be enforced by a state.  
Bitcoin money, ie holding private keys would be held as reserve money.   
Bitcoin's base layer is trustless and is not scalable.    That is money.  If you think it should scale at the base layer to meet all of the requirements of currency, Bcash is more for you.

Bitcoin replaces Central Banking. Bitcoin is money, not currency, despite the name "crypto currency."
Yes, Bitcoin requires a currency layer and further scaling on the base layer. Every improvement on the base layer leverages onto other layers.  Lightning helps.   A banking type layer will be easy. There is nothing other than insufficient demand that prevents a Visa type network running over a trustless base or Lightning layer.  
Bitcoin will scale even if partly with trust organizations.

I am in communications since prior to the Internet.  And a student of Marshall Mcluhan. He died before the Internet was here.  He made this testable hypothesis: A truly new media has been created if and only if prior media are communicated within it.  He didn't get to see the Internet and moreso mobile Internet swallow every prior media.  
Money is a communication medium.  Gold has high fidelity but is lumpy and heavy.  Bank money is information but is saturated with loss (aka inflation) and distortion (aka bank fraud).  
Up until Bitcoin, bank money has not really been captured by the Internet.  It uses it as transport but not as a native application.  
So I will dispute that Bitcoin will take decades to overtake money.   I think Bitcoin's market cap will exceed the Fed's balance sheet before 2030.

Yours is a valid point.  Gold is consensual.  
The important difference of is that Bitcoin has far more intention built in.  It is designed as money.  It is widely discussed and deliberated.  The protocol itself is governed by anarchical acceptance by a "market.". Bitcoin has numerical accounting properties.

So the Blockchain is essentially a list of all past transactions.  A new transaction must meet two requirements.  It must be consistent with the Bitcoin rules (as implemented in code) and it must be consistent with the history of the Blockchain.  
Some quantity of bitcoin can only be reassigned to a new public address if the current sender has the correct signature to do so with the private key.  The Blockchain records all of these such transactions.  A person can't create new coins that are not already in provenance. 
The node operators keep both the rules and the history in order.  A transaction is trivially verifiable by any node.  Miners are special nodes.  They order which transactions get entered into the Blockchain. They are bound by the rules because if they don't create valid history, they don't get paid. They get paid in new Bitcoin's, but the protocol creates the coins, the miners do not.  They burn energy in solution of a cryptographic puzzle, they bruteforce guess a complex hash which includes information up to the point of the previous block. 
Once a block of several transactions is entered on to the Blockchain, it is very difficult to reverse. There is the potential for a double spend if the person accepting Bitcoin accepts the transaction before it enters a block. The solution is to wait for a block or two to be created before accepting the trade. 
From time to time, independent miners create blocks nearly simultaneously and broadcast them to the network of nodes.  Then one part of the network accepts one block and another the other.  Both states can't persist so one of the blocks gets discarded or orphaned.  This creates a tiny opportunity for a double spend.  But not practically.  
Any transaction that has two blocks succeeding it is nearly impossible to reverse.

Money is a medium.  
The innovation of Bitcoin is understood best by understanding the evolution of media.
Consider that metal coins with the Roman or Chinese emperor's likeness was the only image that the peasants would ever see of them.  Coins were the equivalent of the constant bombardment of imagery by TV in the past generation.  I am not saying money is propaganda.  It is, but it is so much more.  Propaganda is noise in communication of value  use of a medium.  Money is a medium.  Gold and silver are mediums.  The emperor's face is noise.  
Bitcoin is a noiseless, lossless, peer to peer, digital value communication medium.
Bitcoin is similar to how the internet news media is spinning radically from central control.  Not only is that of the kind of utility that you are referring, it is a wholesale global cultural turnover.  
The significance is greater than the Internet even.

Nobody knows, especially the little guy. Many people think that financial crises are manufactured by the people who set the money supply, the interest rate.  The boom busts are contrived to their advantage.  The only play is not to play.  It appears we are headed for higher rates.  This means a recession.  But they can change course whenever they feel like it.  Who knows.  It's good to be the king's banker.

No. Education on its face seems fine.  But have a look at that word.  Subject educates object.  It describes the process from the point of view of the educator.  This then meets the needs of the educator.  
The educator has all incentive to propagate and misinform.  The left right paradigm is just such misinformation.  
We should want skilled, informed, thinking people freely discussing ideas.  
No idealogy or person can gain acceptance without scrutiny. There can be no safe spaces for liberalism, feminism, Marxism, Judaism.  I pick those specifically because criticisms of these are labelled hate speech.  There is hateful speech but so what?  Free speech guarantees speech, not being heard and it does not save from you being offended.

The world is responding to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has not responded one iota to regulation, and no transactions have been prevented by any organization.  Some of the use has been regulated but that is a fool's tyranny.  It won't affect anything in the long run and proves the potency of Bitcoin and the impotency of "government."
Ripple is not money.  Bitcoin is.  Bitcoin replaces fiat central banks.  The fiat banks like Ripple because it is not a threat.  Let them eat Ripple cake.
Government crypto currency is a joke and no bother to Bitcoin.  Potency/impotency.
If companies can find application for blockchains, have at it.  It's open source.  But those applications are not a global money.  Again no bother.
I think that the conclusion must be the opposite.  Nakamoto is or would be quite happy with where Bitcoin is at.  Just as I think Nicolas van Saberhagen would be quite happy with where his creation is at.

Funny that public education is a leftist domain but you blame the right that children can't get decent employment after 12 or 16 years of training. 
Trump lies, Obama lied, the Bushes lied, the Clintons lie. Pelosi, Waters, and Booker lie and incite violence.  They all borrow money against your future and mass murder with that money. Actually eliminated many people.  
I hear Saudi Arabia will starve maybe 10 Million Yemenis. Where is the world on that one?!?!   But don't say bad things on Gab.  It is all marketing.  I happen to think Trump is a bit better because at least he is tapping into the flow.  He lies but he is responsive to some of the people.
Hitler lied.  His people had almost no opportunity to know otherwise.  He knew how to use broadcast media.  We have the opportunity to know but you would squelch and channel what is correct.  
The antedote to another Hitler is not to be uncritical of Judaism, Jews and Israel. (Or Marxism or all it's camouflaged variants)  The antedote to Hitler and Stalin and Mao and Trump and all of them is free speech.  You need to study Chinese and Russian 20th Century history.  And the History of fiat money. And restudy the relationship between war and money including into ancient  Greek and Chinese times.  Money has been a brutal brutal lie. 
 Disallowing certain conversations is a literal death march for both sides.
Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, PayPal, TV, and YouTube are the problem by censoring certain kinds of arbitration.  Fuck them.  They aren't shutting down lefty.
Say whatever you want on Gab.  Good for Gab.  Let's have the actual necessary conversations.  Shitty ideas get dropped eventually. Shitty controlling media too.  It is not up to you or me or Mark Zuckerberg or CNN what constitutes allowable conversation.

I think that most people have a naive view of fiat systems.  The entire point of fiat money is so that a very few issue currency that the very many are compelled to use.  It is a business. With a grotesque business model.  
The point of wars has been to obtain economic domain over an expanded area and group of people.  To gain the new benefit to the king through obedience and taxation.  Everything else is gobbledegook propaganda.  
An implicit aspect of war since antiquity is to impose the emperor's coin into the new subject economy.  
So how does a Bitcoin whale wage war?  The incentives are badly negative. He spends his Bitcoin and now has to control a population that he can't.  
 For the fiat Prince, the incentives are highly positive. Well they have been. Quite a few people now know that the fiat banking business model is a stupid, bloody ruse. Even absent Bitcoin, I think war is getting less tenable.  When the USA finally meets the end of dollar hegemony, as it is now, the game is over forever.

Lightning will not prevent the congestion, but the fact that it is functioning should tell people that there are better ways to make transactions convenient.  
The true value of Bitcoin, a digital bearer asset with peer to peer transactions is the reason people will want to own it.

Well now there is a point or two we can half agree on. Much of the happenings in the world is bread and circus.  We are being fleeced by the artificial left right lie.  Stay on that point.   But once more, the solution to that is to allow conversation, ESPECIALLY conversation that rankles our own personal sensibilities.  I accept that I have been propagandized.  Do you?
Look, mostly it doesn't matter. Control is being abandoned.  It's just not possible.  I don't have to care.  Speech was never controllable but mass media is being replaced with the  internet The age of freedom and personal responsibility is arriving.  Hallelujah. The financial debts will not be enforced.  Centre is an illusion.  The hierarchy of bank state elitism can not persist in the face of the internet and crypto currency.  Authority is a lie by it's nature.   You are better equipped by embracing this reality. The elite will try to dominate the internet and crypto money. They will fail.  The rush of the elite's wealth into crypto will be astounding.  HODL tight. Go for freedom. It has a bitter taste but it sustains.  .
As if TV, print, and radio isn't exactly for getting people worked up in specific fashion.  The Internet is a problem for the ultra powerful because they can no longer work people up the way they want to.  They are trying and you would help them!!
You can call people far left or right, but the problem is not them.  The problem is the naivety or evil you are expressing.  You can't save the world by moderating speech.  You can only harm it. You would blame Alex Jones for the Loserbomber but not CNN for the disasters in the Middle East.
We must unite is a really poor argument.  
Yes we are "dividing." Good!!! That is a very wholesome outcome.  "Unity" of thought is extremely dangerous.  It is super arrogant to think that you can know what is correct. I don't, you don't, the Pope don't, every one don't. You are god manifest as much as anyone else.
Horrible shit, big horrible shit, will happen if we keep investing in the idea that one monkey knows best.  He don't!  There is no high upon the high arbiter of truth and justice.  If there were, he wouldn't be that puffy faced weakling Zuckerberg. 
No human can know the way for another. 
So, yeah, Facebook and Google don't have a public obligation to me.  But Gab has none to you.  Gab is open. It will succeed for now but it is centralized so it too will be replaced.  Bitcoin and Monero are non hierarchical and open, they will succeed.

"All hail The Fed!" Wow, that is stinky propaganda.  Oh, it's the NYT.  
What central bank holds USD happily (except Saudis and Israelis)? Everyone resents the USA and for very good reason. The USD system is a self reinforcing power system that cycles military power to create demand for dollars which allows for cost-free issuance of more dollars which pays for more military might.  
The Eurozone, Russia, China, (representing large economic power) amongst many are actively building banking systems independent of the SWIFT/Fed/BIS/IMF system.   These are the things that wars get fought over.  The ability to impose which bank or government chit is used in commerce is a highly prized power, for thousands of years.
A politically neutral value transfer protocol will solve all of that.  Chinese businesses can transfer value to Iranian oil producers with no interference from US banks. This seems an inevitability.

 People make bad choices sometimes and good sometimes.  That's their business, not mine nor yours nor any busybody's in Washington or London or the Vatican or whatever.  
The poor choices of others is not the concern of authority even though they (and you) would have it so.  People's ignorance of money is no reason to use state authority to impose a fiat monopoly inflation in order to incent people to divest themselves of money for their own good orfor some bullshit abstract like "helping the economy."
Indeed, holding the most fungible asset you can get is in the individual's interest because it can be exchanged for anything else later on.  It is in the individual's best interest to hold money, *except* for the presence of inflation.  
So fiat currency then is evil on multiple fronts.  One, it can not exist when people can make convenient alternative choices of what they will use as money, so it requires suppressing of freedom of conscience, a high high evil.  Two, it creates inflation, which is theft because the people who create it in the first instant benefit at the expense of those that accept it (under state compulsion).  Third, to your point, it creates an incentive to divest the fungible asset (due to value decrease) which again is against the interest of the individual in question.
So go ahead, live that world.  I am much happier with the authority of the code and blockchain than the authority of government and banks.  I will look after myself.  I don't want your "men with guns" who lie when they say that they will look after me.  Come on. Think about it.  They don't care about you. Stop acting as their dump hole.  Your piety is wasted.

@_date: 2019-02-28 19:44:19
That is true, but be careful of the film's conclusions.  It seems to err in a few key fashions.
1) It wants to blame imaginary entities for the problems, entities like the "US" or "Americans." That's a bit naive.  The USA is as equally occupied by "foreign" banking as is any country. The parasite class have no nationalities nor religion nor philosophy.  
2) It seems to lean toward a solution being just a "better" kind of management of fiat central bank.  It doesn't matter if a central bank is owned by the government or is "independent." It centrally controls and dispenses credit for the benefit of the parasite.  It can't be improved upon.  
The only way to win the game is to not play.  It is rigged.

Economics is not science.  Human welfare is fairly personal and fuzzy.  You can not reduce economy to simple engineering equations.
This is the entire point.  Jesus Christ himself doesn't have the moral character to toy with the economy.  It's just plain evil to muck with people's lives by trying to manipulate variables that are not real

So now we enter the phase of national sovereign altcoins.  Which will all fail.
Cryptos are global, have no state involvement, and require no identity   (ie no membership in a country) by the user.  There is no way that state-owned crypto currency can compete. 
Crypto currency is an asset in itself.  Backing it with another asset is just another human promise, which always are baked fake in the cake.   "Trust me," from the mouths of government is a prima facie lie.  
It's good that we are at this phase.  It is passing and once big players like Russia realize that they can't compete with a neutral open-source protocol, they will start using it.

Bitcoin is too tiny a beast to be stable.  If it ever does reach the size of one of the major currencies of today, it might vary a few %per year.    Clearly that is many years away. Bitcoin price will increase and decrease with demand. Presumably Bitcoint leaves this speculative behavior once it fills it's niche.

No. Even duping the clueless isn't possible in a hyperinflation or mass debt default.  
There may only be a small minority who see that fiat is a scam, but it's a rapidly growing one.  
The US debt doubles about every decade.  At $44T and normal interest rates, the interest payment will be a significant proportion of GDP.  That means mass defaults or big inflation.  The game is ending.
Mass defaults is when you want to have your assets not involved in the banks. Mass inflation is when you want to have your assets not involved in the banks.

The size is part of the problem.  More than half USD is held and used outside the USA. Almost none of those people really want to but have few other options, as the NYT piece so gushingly states. 
There has been significant inflation in many asset types.  Consumer prices are determined by consumers who did not benefit from TARP QEs and zero interest rates as much as the "1%" did.  Gold is at all time highs in every currency except the USD where it's close.  
Interest rates are still highly accommodating.  And markets went through cardiac arrest raising them to even these low rates.  What do you think real estate and stocks will do at say 8% rather than 2?  Are you aware of what happened with Volcker's 20% rates?  Interest rates matter.  
For now, the USD is imposed by cruise missile.  That can't persist.  Nobody wants that. Governments and big companies will route around the USD banking system. This is already happening.   Once these routes are established, they won't need to hold USD cash in the same amount.  The devaluation of the dollar will happen.  I don't think it will be a hyper inflation because the domestic US economy is too real for that.  
@_date: 2019-02-11 23:44:21
OK. I guess I disagree in one major way.  
It is not the concern of me or you or any authority as to what an individual decides to do but also as to what the impact is on greater economy.  
The only purpose of money is to conduct value.  It must be liquid and fungible and valued.  If it has those properties, people will hold some.  People should hold something that they can be confident in to buy bread and rent.  So it is in their interest to hold some.  It is then an abuse of authority to devalue (actually dilute value) through inflation.  
Which is what I am trying to convey.  So the difference between your opinion and mine is fundamental and fine enough. 
Since I can get philosophically what I need from free market money, and you can get what you want from fiat authority money, it's perfectly resolvable to disagree.  
The only thing that I ask (insist actually), is that you do not advocate to remove my choice.

Really?  What if I said it is imaginary or notional if delusion is too strong for your palate?
By the way, delusions can have their valuable purpose.  Valuing Bitcoin's UTXOs is certainly mass delusion, but more concrete delusion than valuing bank money.  
Bank money is accounting entries.  How do some parties' credit/debit entries have actual value?  
If you don't already know that bank money is purely notional, it's units only existing in human imagination, and it's value as an agreement in mass delusion, it's too big a job for me to get you there  You have the hook swallowed deep. 
Authority is not real, it is a convention, an agreement, there is no divine right of kings.  God flows through me as much as it does  Elizabeth, so she has no inherent right to authority, nor do her family, her Lords and their elected and unelected employees.  The compulsion upon me to value City of London accounting notions and notes is not divinely granted to anyone.  It is a convenient conventional covenant, but it is artificial.    If you can explain why a piece of painted plastic with the symbols 100 buys much more rum than one with the symbols 10 on it, then you know that bank money is delusion.

Socially: No barrier to entry, non hierarchy in issuance, global, can help avoid surveillance dystopia, reduce power of banks and government, market determined protocol changes. reduced trust requirement, reduced jurisprudence requirement, new manner to issue currency and equity (ICOs)
Technologically: programmable, perfect provenance, non-blockable messaging

Not to disagree too much ...
But it is quite rational to have some savings in legal tender cash, so it is not ignorant to do so.  
For most people, savings is not about investment.  It is about having something for bread tomorrow and rent at the end of the month.  Any excess value on hand that is likely to be spent in the following short term (as perceived by the individual) really is better in cash (including cash on deposit at bank).  For wealthier people having six months of expenses in hand can represent a significant amount of money.  
The reason is easy to understand.  Legal tender is  accepted, fungible and liquid.  I can exchange it for almost anything else.  
Cash on deposit at a bank is legally a loan to the bank.  Negative interest is insane and can only be achieved with a high degree of compulsion against the owner of the cash.  This is already true at suppressed levels of interest.  The only way that it flies is that legal tender laws are so successful at corralling the population that the cost of the efforts to escape are more expensive than the cost of negative interest. 
Welcome to the surveillance feudal dystopia.

Bonds also get devalued with inflation and  demolished by hyper inflation.  And pension plans.   Many companies disappear during financial transition, so stocks can evaporate too.  Most stocks are held by people through several custodial chains, many of the links in those chains get lost in chaos leaving the investor with a contract to hold stocks enforceable against a company that does not exist anymore even if the stock still has value.

I think that Keynes provided a false framework of untruth and was elevated in esteem by those who controlled the printing presses of his day.  
Money is a conductor of value, a medium of value exchange, nothing more,. It in itself has nothing to do with economy.  Nothing.  All changing money supply does is temporarily mal-adjust the measuring stick called pricing in an assymetric and larcenous manner.  
Money is information.  We have the Internet now.  There is no longer a way to remove freedom of choice in money. No sentient human will choose a product that is against his interest.  Bitcoin may fail but the idea can not.  It is unlikely even that Bitcoin fails.

You really have to like Dalio.  Hyper intelligent, polite, caring,...
But he is being a bit coy here and for obvious reasons.  
The nine inning cycle he describes is not an emergent market phenomenon.  It is an orchestrated ruse by central banks.  The phase he describes where there is an irrational euphoria of extrapolation from past productive debt is when interest rates should begin to rise if they were set at market.  Smarter people would not provide credit just because there is euphoria, they would start to track against risk. But the central bank removes the incentive to choose risk properly and provides backwards signals in the credit market.  The central bank feeds the euphoria in positive feedback loop. 
If money supply was quite constant, there is no opportunity to cross these signals. The people who control the central bank, do not want calm seas. Their profits are derived from the  rise and fall of the tsunami.  The Fed created inflation of the 1920s, 1970s, and from mid 1990s until now, created the subsequent economic shrinkage.  The one pending is enourmous. 
There is clear evidence is that central banking is a conceived den of vipers and thieves 
Dalio knows this. It is quite likely that his contacts at the Fed tell him quite precisely what happens next at any moment.  I like him because he is a caring and humane farmer, but he is a farmer nonetheless.

Just remember, that as long as Central Banks have a near monopoly on money, they can temporarily distort the price of money (interest rates). 
Someday they will visciously distort the rates higher.  
They profit highly in both distortions. They play the game for profit.  They're not your friend.  If you believe any of the BS that they are just trying to help, you are a complete fool.  
You are held in place by government, so that banks can do what they want to do with your time and energies.

Most of them are not really paradoxes.  
Congestion and storage are the same problem and are getting solved. 
Bitcoin is a money-like digital durable reusable commodity so of course it has no cash flow to discount to present value, that's a dumb argument.  It is scarce and useful, with some seeing potential use demand in the future, so it is a reasonable speculative investment.  
Bitcoin has no identity.  It is not a contract.  That doesn't preclude contracts. It's range of contract possibilities is larger than bank money because it is programmable. N

The price is what matters to you?  Bitcoin's network was unaffected. Zero. Not even close.  The BCH hashwar didn't even affect the networks of the two BCH coins.  They split and could have done so without over hashing.  This nonsense that the number of blocks or cumulative proofing work defines which is the true coin is ridiculous.  The rule of most proofing work resolving which chain is definitive is ONLY REGARDS COMPETING CHAINS WITHIN THE SAME RULESET.  
If people are scared from Bitcoin due to the non event of the BCash split, so be it, but that is simply a poor understanding of the mechanics and the market.  If we were in a strong bull market, this would get shrugged oft in a day.  BCASH is and was irrelevant.  Bitcoin is doing fine.

What's your point 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:04:33
I think the same ideas apply as always.  
Bitcoin is strange, powerful new beast.  Blockchain is a revolutionary concept and Bitcoin's blockchain is the only blockchain that has any real relevance at all. (I also like Ethereum and Monero, but they just aren't nearly as relevant as Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin is a peer to peer value transfer network.  It is not a payment system.  It is money.  
As far as I know, the protocol is not broken and functions as normal.  The ecosystem is far more advanced than, say, a year ago.  
What seems to be happening is a panic selling period following a panic buying period.  
Should you buy?  If you have none in your portfolio and you can afford for whatever position you might take to go to zero, then should really consider it.  The fundamental are as good as ever.  It could go to zero, but personally, I think someone buying now will see big three year gains.

&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really though.  Yes, that&amp; the way the protocol operates, but nodes can easily add a little checkpoint code so as to reject the intruding chain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp; not a cheap attack.  Just as much work is required, so in your example, for a week at $1500, BTC that might be some $15,000,000.  It is not subtle either.  The  offending chain is easily differentiated from the preferred original.  And can be rebuffed with a simple retroactive checkpoint added ad hoc without requiring a hardfork.  Node operators can just add it under widespread agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:38:14
And have identity as a required element in who holds the private key?

Maybe it's just me. I have always thought that the BCash hardfork was idiocy and that within a few blocks, respective hashrate is irrelevant. They are two coins.  
There have been a few prominent examples where hashrate follows price follows community preference.  Were you around when BCash split off.  At one point, something like 90% of the miners preferred Bitcoin I think Unlimited.  But they obediently got into line once the price told them what was preferred.  Same now, same with Ethereum.  
Mining matters, miners do not.

The checkpoint addition is so benign and helpful, I doubt anyone would perceive it as authority driven.  It doesn't even need to be added to the main code, just a bit of code that can be added by node operators.  The last known good block would be obvious and would be agreed to within a few hours.  Add checkpoint info, bye bye intrusive chain, a few confused blocks get rejected and transactions from them get transmitted to mempool.  Within hours, the confusion is done, Better prepared for next time.  I would buy that dip hard.

It's true.  
I think what Ethereum and other platform coins are doing are extremely interesting but their monetary aspect (Ethereum's blockchain) or their governance model (EOS) are so screwed that they can only go so far.
As much as I like Monero, it is a very complex protocol, and as such, years behind Bitcoin in aspects like multisig, sidechains and higher layers.  Native fungibility is better, but there is something good in the simpler protocol.

Forks are not inflationary.  New code forks live in different economy niches and only compete marginally.  Blockchain forks do not dilute the ownership proportions. Several of the top competing coins are supply controlled (Ethereum, Ripple, EOS) so their market cap supply factor is dubious. Bitcoin is open source.  After ten years, it is dominant. Forks are not inflationary.  
Nothing has come close to touching Bitcoin's qualities. Lots of experiments...
 Your quoted text is circular and tautological.  Of course if a money is worthless to you tomorrow, you don't want it today, but then of course precisely the opposite is true too.

Central banks are smart enough to not even attempt to offer a crypto.  
Anything that is not based on a simple public/private key pair, but has some element of identity is just plain not a crypto currency. Without identity and with ad hoc participation, there is no limit to membership, so a crypto currency is a global offering.  
Without peer to peer operation, verifiable public blockchain, open source function, community chosen rules, etc, its just not a crypto currency.  
Ultimately all assets are valued in the market, even really huge liquidity pools like USD.  Compelling value into currency using "men with guns" will only work for so long. 
The markets for fiat currency are corroding rapidly.  The Euro members are less copacetic as time goes on.  European banks, Russia, China, Saudis, Iran, all want out of SWIFT.  The buyers for US Treasuries are disappearing. Faith in the USA is rightfully dissipating, as the country openly demonstrates its impotence and immorality. 
Without a binding authority like the US military, global coordination of central banking is open rivalry. This is probably the dominance yet unspoken theme in world politics.  Once this rivalry gains momentum, the USD hegemony is finished.  Bitcoin will be everyone's politically neutral ally.

I think that all hierarchical structures are fragile and immoral.  The only way they function is that the incentives for enough of all the players need to be positive or perceived as such.  Whatever party sits in the top power position must receive large incentive because why bother otherwise.  The next top levels (enforcers) must have outsized incentive.  A sizable proportion of the lower levels must at least perceive positive incentive.  There will be many at the bottom levels who receive negative incentive.  Their labours are required to keep the enterprise intact, but they are net negative beneficiaries.
This is true in government and moreso in fiat banking.  Because money itself is best when it is transportable, it really is just communication of messages.  Because fiat money is nothing more than arbitrarily credit/debit ledger entries, this requires a very odd set of protocols to ensure scarcity, especially at an interconnected global level.  Who is in charge of the ledger is the highest privilege of power.  This is in fact the power that all others that can be paid for with fiat  money pay fealty to.  Wars are pretty much all about who gets that power as long as legal tender enforcement happens within a geography.
The bottom line of all that is simple.  Nearly all of the participants in the fiat hierarchy are rivals.  But they bind together as an oligarchy against the masses.  
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
Bitcoin is that kind of friend to rivalrous fiat banks and to the masses.  
The Bitcoin protocol has sounder rules and is not infinitely hierarchical via a potentially infinite ledger and the rules enforcement is performed at the edge out in the open.  
Bitcoin has established a $100B beachhead.  I think that is already unassailable.  At another 10X,   the incentives to remain beholden to mass murdering enforcement of arbitrary and historically cheating fiat rulemakers flips over completely.  
Why would China or Russia or Iran or Saudi Arabia or we plebs put up with US bullshit?  We only do so now to access the banking system.  
There could be some setback at exchanges but peer to peer Bisq is not subject to that, nor of course is the Blockchain.

That violates the First Amendment in the US Bill of Rights.  Note that these are rights.  The Bill of Rights acknowledges these rights.  The rights themselves are yours independent of law even though you may have a difficult time asserting them without the assistance of others. 
So any such law would face a Supreme Court hearing.  If it stood up, then literally there is no legal protection for freedom of conscience, because software and messages are already recognized as constitutionally protected speech.  So choice of Bitcoin is a matter of conscience.  
Any organization that asserts a power over individual conscience is in deep trouble.  This is unenforceable and will lead to the worst kinds of trouble.  
The personal defense against this type of authority is of course to do commerce beyond its reach or even knowledge.  Enough people know this already.  Laws would not be observed and are less enforceable than copyright law.
There was a plan to enforce a global fiat money standard using the old bank account model.  This is failing and Bitcoin, etc is a big stick in the cogs.  
I think they don't know what to do.  Really what can they do?  The only path to success is to convince people not to use and cherish Bitcoin.  
They never have been in the convincing business, these governments.  They convince through guns and propaganda.  And centralized money.  These modes are all failing.

I look at it this way.  If there is a financial collapse, which I think will happen at some point, then what kind of assets does one want to have?
In the past, gold was your best bet.  In more recent times, USDollar was favoured.  People retract into safer territory, the most fungible and liquid assets.  Bitcoin is in the same category.  It is not as fully acknowledged, but in many ways it is more liquid than bank money or metals.   
Bitcoin is not traditionally regarded in that way but I think people should want to have some in the potential of bank failures or hyperinflation.  
That gold is at or near all time highs against most fiat currency tells me that the world is not confident in government currency.   
And honestly, who really has faith in the US government at the moment?
@_date: 2018-11-13 16:01:28
So let's cut it off here.  That's a law that can be applied to a person or a corporation if they can be considered to have  done that but not against use of software generally.  I guess one could argue that all Bitcoin transactions might be for nefarious purpose, so they all must be reported, but I don't think people will comply and it would be terribly expensive to enforce. There are a quarter million on chain transactions per day and Lightning will be millions soon enough.  
And sure, using the Internet exposes one's machine, but it does not prevent transactions and   identity still is very tenuous.  
Anyway, thanks for the conversation.

Maybe very soon with the Bakkt etc events.  Meanwhile use-case demand is expanding.  
Once the price levels, the perceived risk is lower. Then people begin to take small positions, then more people perceive a good return and the positive price feedback returns.  FOMO up to100,000 and FONGO down to 40,000. (Fear of not getting out).

Yes, the military, the economy and the USD are mutually reinforcing.  
Currently, and for many decades, this has worked.  It's failing now.  
All institutions that can are bucking USD hegemony. Europe, Russia, China, Brazil, Saudi Arabia have all openly rejected US dominance.  Of course Iraq, Libya and Venezuela must be added posthumously.  
Currency failures in other places like Argentina and Turkey are bad news for the USD too.  The retreat to safe haven assets means the financial system is failing.  In the short term this provides relative strength to the USD.  
The US has terrible balance of payments due to the USD.  This means the US economy doesn't compete, the US population doesn't compete. The US can easily maintain itself domestically but it can not for very long export both foreign military power and not goods and services.  Perversely, the USD gains in the short term due to this structural flaw. 
The altering of the USD in the 20th Century to 1) Federal Reserve Notes in 1913, to 2) defined $20 per gold ounce to $35 in 1934, to 3) agreed centre of global currency in 1944 to 4) the ending of that agreement in 1971 to 5) floating dollar for gold exchange is a radical set of changes.  
The current regime is new historical territory and has some real problems.  
The comptroller of the USD, the Federal Reserve is opaque.  As mentioned, the USD based global banking system is coming apart.  The US domestic economic and political situation is fracturing badly.  Don't tell me there's a boom on with tent cities in all California cities and with states and cities defaulting regularly.  There is an urban dystopia in the US.  
The US failed to assert its goals in Syria.  The US will not enforce its own southern border over which 40,000 people cross illegally per month! Iran is selling oil outside the SWIFT system.  This is US impotence. 
The US asserted the USD against very weak competition since WW2.

Right enough.  But the USD is not immune to swallowing it's own tail in hyperinflation.  The various leaks in the ship can only be patched by thinking the hull so many times.  
The World Bank and the IMF can only intervene if there are solvent economies to draw wealth from.   A few are solvent but none are improving.  The US has a short term respite due to tax cuts and government spending but the trend was very bad not long ago.  
We started talking about whether the USD will remain as world reserve currency.  It will not. For now, sure.   Almost every other country wants out.  The US business model is tapping out.   I wouldn't bet too hard against the US in the short term.  In the long term, the USD is done.

There are two arguments in the article.  
One is that an inferior product will be replaced in the absence of barrier to entry into the market.  This doesn't hold water.  Bitcoin is the superior product due to several key features.  There are significant barriers to entry for competition coins.   The author was referring to legal regulatory barriers, but that is only one form of barrier.  
The second is that mining is a natural monopoly that favours scale and as it approaches a monopoly, the benefits of decentralization will evaporate.  There is some evidence to support this.  It hasn't really harmed anything as yet but that doesn't absolutely prevent it.

There are two automated predictions markets, Augur and Gnosis.  I haven't paid attention to them in awhile to be honest. 
I find illicit to connotate illegal or morally rejected.  Alot of financial transactions are not permitted due to other reasons than those.  
Permitted, Legal and moral are not much the same.  I will go with boggleroggle.  Permissionless isn't a great term either as it still makes reference to permission.  Bitcoin has no frame of reference at all that even considers permission.  Anyway...
Also... mining cost follows price through a  process known as difficulty adjustment. The mining rewards are in Bitcoin so the value of the rewards is a direct function of current Bitcoin price.  Since it is a permissionless competition to solve the mining puzzle, mining tends to be marginal.  The network is designed to keep a fairly constant block production rate.  So as hashrate increases or decreases, the difficulty to solve the puzzle automatically adjusts with it to keep the block production rate fairly constant.  The net of all that is that the cost to produce fairly well mimics the price of the coin with difference due to price changes and the local circumstances of the miner in question.  
So the value is the demand value and mining costs follow. They are not fundamental like say gold, if that makes sense.
@_date: 2019-01-29 23:16:17
In some ideal world, Bitcoin has a very stable price.  In that world, mining becomes very marginal as there is no fundamental barriers and no changing price feedback.  The costs must be marginally below the price or the business fails. Simple.
The value of Bitcoin is in it's permissionless nature.  To hold or to spend requires no third party, merely a functional network.  The network functions very well up to this point.  
Ultimately, who would prefer to require permission to spend one's own money, so we differ on which is "real money."  So you may not want to hold it, but you may have a requirement that you want to be unencumbered by banks.  There is real and growing use for this.  Every week some $10s of millions are transferred into Venezuela, evading bank sanctions imposed by the international banks and by the Venezuelan banks.  That's real use demand not speculation.  
I think that the speculative value sees the possibility of more and more use of the currency units.  The array of possibilities compared to banks is as potent as the Internet as compared to traditional media.  Not merely political posture.  Of course, money separated from state seems better in any aspect (not only idealogical) than money evoked by state, at least to many of us.  
Illicit purposes is a real use case.  Illicit does not necessarily mean immoral.  Venezuelans are surviving from starvation by their international contacts.  Illicit but quite moral.  State prohibition of most narcotics (Opioids excepted) is far more immoral than the "illicit"use of the narcotics. Viagra without prescription.  Illicit, hardly immoral.  70% taxation rate so that some stupid immature moralist has spending power is immoral.... 
Human dignity is greatly increased by freedom from government imposition of what is money and how it will be used.  Illicit in many contexts, not immoral and a highly valued use.  
@_date: 2019-01-09 01:06:51
That's one take on things.  WADR, you are also delusional.  
It's your subjective judgement that this Bitcoin thing is wasted ambition.  I think you are really wrong about that.  
There is no business or piece of land that the people who print money can not obtain for themselves for no value provided to anyone else.  Bitcoin is anti this serfdom, so it is a moral enterprise amongst other things  It is hard to put a price on that.  There is no social progress possible on any front as long as a certain class of people can force at gunpoint the definition of what is money.  Whatever value or goodness built can just be bought or stolen by those who have primary benefit of printing money.  
If you think fiat money is a vehicle for fairness and is not specifically for creating hierarchy, you are no more than a useful deluded fool.

I think that you miss the point of Bitcoin.  Sure there are many who fit the profile of what you state.  
But that's not the point of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is brilliant.  It has a verifiably perfect transaction history.  And can be used without the consent of a third party.  
This is a huge innovation relative to 16th century double entry accounting money (that is, banks).  Banks are opaque and known for fraud as much as anything else.  
It has not been about convenient payments or credit yet.  But those are emerging.  
You seem intelligent but judgemental.  It might benefit you to ask a few questions before judging because you clearly have missed something about Bitcoin in the noise you have decided to focus on. Or, just you know, go do your thing somewhere else if all you want to do here is spew   ignorant judgement.  You aren't novel.  Your analysis is common as dirt and just as valued around here.

The reason that the USD is the pricing standard is because of it's relative liquidity.  
Bitcoin is not currently very liquid, but it's basic properties of global use and zero barrier to entry will lead to super liquidity.  Even though many here do not like futures markets, these will reduce short term volatility which will also help Bitcoin become the price conducting standard.  In time and after a few big problems are addressed.

I look at it this way.  The arc of history favours freedom, as much as it might seem otherwise at times.  
It is a fascinating back and forth technological fight between those who wish to rule and those that wish to be free.  I actually understand both of the sentiments.  The scoundrels are the people that follow orders, not the order givers.  I mean the people that give themselves for little or poor compensation. A smaller scorn for those who just  go along thoughtlessly: live like cattle, get cattle wages.

@_date: 2019-01-29 16:58:17
It's all about cash flow.  Often times a business can operate in the red for periods as long as they have positive cash flow.  Sunk capital cost doesn't matter in the short term.  So a miner might have to sell their coins BELOW their true costs (which will include capital allocation costs.)  
So in a price down turn, some are in survival mode and since their capital costs are unrecoverable, they still mine to keep cash flow, hoping that either difficulty drops or price increases.  
As long as their cash flow is marginally positive and their debt is not being collected, they can keep going for awhile.  
This is a compounding effect to low prices.  The lower the prices, the more desperate is the need for miners to sell until enough ultimately just give up or mothball operations.  
This overall compounds the normal boom bust cycles of a speculative asset.

It's the same cycle as always. In  2017 awareness of Bitcoin reached billions.  They maybe had heard of it prior but with the huge price spike, they had a closer look.  Most, did not get involved in any fashion. Many had a good hard look and saw a potential bubble and wisely stayed away.  But some proportion of those people have been bitten by the Bitcoin bug.  
There are maybe a few tens of millions of people people who are enthusiasts.  The Bitcoin growth has not anywhere near hit a fundamental limit to its growth.  These are still internal exaggerated positive price feedback events on the way up. (Positive feedback in Control Engineering is a terrible condition, errors get amplified)

Might it be replaced by something better? Quite possible.  But whatever that is, it will have to be significantly better.

I am not saying that the price will definitely go up.  That's unknowable.  I think it will...
In the past as the price went up, there is a lag of time before new hashrate (miners) can enter the market.  This reduced competition relative to the reward makes mining very profitable and this continues as long as the price is rising.  This attracts new hashrate.  Bitcoin has high utility potential and growing real use.  This makes for a high degree of speculation so is quite naturally prone to boom bust price cycles.  Once the speculation seems to have overdone itself, people sell off.  Both price increases and decreases are self reinforcing, positive feedback for control systems engineers.  
The economics of mining as I stated them here amplify the positive feedback and exacerbate the boom bust.    
This all ameliorates with lowered inflation as the mining rewards decrease and a utility demand floor takes hold, where people use it as a means of exchange in the short term and price doesn't matter.  
All of this stated in the context that Bitcoin could go to zero price ten minutes from now.  ��

@_date: 2019-01-30 11:32:00
No. Not really at all.  
Both of your notions are better expressed by the notion of "permissionless." Bank money requires strong identity, contracts and a system of forceful jurisprudence.  We don't think about those things but bank money can't work without that.  Bitcoin takes care of all that in a network protocol.  
Bitcoin requires no identity, no legal contract and no court enforcement, yet it has never been fraudulent and has a perfect (error free to 15 decimals) transaction record.  So a twelve year old in England can send a ten year old in Zimbabwe money and no one else can prevent it or really even know what really happened.
Indeed, the protocol itself can be modified and new networks can be made.  There are thousands of innovations just like that; most are failed experiments.  
So illicit is not a broad enough concept and it is a bit derogatory.  Some of the applications are indeed illicit, but that's just a subset of the freedom of permissionless.  
Posturing or signalling is also an inadequate description.  The printing press, the PC, the Internet were highly "subversive," not as gesture but as real movement of the locus of control from some distant authority to the individual.  Same for Bitcoin but even more powerful than the other examples.  
What the Internet is doing to traditional media, Bitcoin will do to the banks.  Without banks, government is also radically altered.  
Think of the deep sociological impact of a world where commerce happens without third party consent and little third party knowledge.  Most people are frightened by that, but like it or not, it's arriving.  This is a much deeper impact than even the Internet.  
This is hardly mere signalling and really a complete reorienting of power.  But sure, signalling happens too.  
In day to day utility already the uses are substantially broader and deeper.  Free speech platforms, microtransactions, remittance, speculative investment, programmable contracts, automated predictions markets, uncensorable apps.  All valuable, none illict.

What is depicted in that link is slavery (and heartbreaking and reprehensible). There are other degrees of slavery.    
Some American slave owners were not completely indecent (other than the gross indecency of "ownership.")
The Soviet Union forced Ukrainian farmers to give up their crops in the 1930s down to the single grain by threat of punishment of death and then did not feed them.  Millions died of starvation. No chains, no physical compulsion day to day.  They just used laws and guns.  
Laws and guns are used today to create near monopoly of currency within a geographic region. So much so that most people consider government currency to be the only form of money, when it is not even money.  
With this monopoly all manners of hierarchy and abuse take place.  
Some create money by merely adjusting entries in their own books. They do nothing of value for anyone else when they do that.   Others trade their labour for those accounting entries.  Some people get others labour without any effort or value provided by themselves.  That is a form of slavery.  It is not as depraved and physically brutal as what you linked, so yes there is distinction.  It is government enforced and is therefore a similar gross indecency of ownership to remove choice of what is money.  
Perhaps there is a better word than slavery for banker feudalism, but tell me what it is.  I will use the term banker feudalism more often now, for your sake, but I will still use the term slavery as it is still accurate.

I think he was saying that the mining Industry within Bitcoin is a natural monopoly.  That is to say that it ends up naturally in narrow hands.  Then whoever holds that monopoly becomes controlled or even malicious.  So the investment to become a monopoly is really paid for by the mining rewards and miners fees.  
Honestly, this is not a wild ass idea.  There are drifts in that direction.  
@_date: 2019-01-09 13:36:31
Let me burn off all that straw, man.
I am not saying Bitcoin solves inequality; that's a daft gambit.  I am saying that Bitcoin does not feature the feudal nature of fiat currency.  People will use it as per OP's post as means to avoid having their finances at the permission of banks.  
Neither do I think the point of Bitcoin is to hodl and get rich.  I think that will happen but it is not what Bitcoin is for.  
Neither do I think that Bitcoin will magically solve poverty.  
Neither do I think that possessing money is being rich.  With potentially infinite inflation characteristics of fiat currency, pursuing cash as investment is stupid.  
Why Bitcoin is an important enterprise is a different matter.  
Freedom.  Bitcoin is highly permissive.  No identity or contract is required to hold or to transact in it.  This is a highly desirable trait both morally and utilitarian.  
Fiat currency is a feudal system. A privileged few are enfranchised by State to create currency.  The rest of us are compelled to use it.  That is a repugnant refutation of freedom of conscience. I will be free to value what I like along with millions of people who value Bitcoin.  The value taken from the masses and provided to the few via the inflation-deflation mechanism is the purpose of the fiat scam.  
This privilege is jealously pursued.  Hence war, currency zones, banking sanctions.  Bitcoin does not solve hierarchy or poverty but it does allow me to be productive without adding to the hierarchy of the flat system 
You seem only interested in utility... Bitcoin is useful in ways that fiat is not.  Bitcoin feeds families in Venezuela and helps avoid capital control for Iranians and Russians. Bitcoin is used for many kinds of commerce that require permissiveness, including speech freedom. Bitcoin has utility.  
I will concede two points.  
People are better off to pursue building businesses than acquisition of money or especially currency. 
Bitcoin is too volatile in price for any finance of time periods beyond the horizons of futures contracts.  This is likely to be improved over time as Bitcoin's liquidity pool and futures markets mature. 
The problem that Bitcoin is attempting to solve is of paramount importance.  There are several risks to Bitcoin actually solving the problem.  Thus Bitcoin is a highly worthwhile but highly risky undertaking.  It's foolish to say either way that Bitcoin will or will not challenge fiat.  I hope it does.  In the meantime, it does great things for my business and for my minimizing benefit to the fiat mongers.

It seems you are not really very knowledgeable about crypto currency.  I don't mean that as insulting, more of an observation/question.  A competent crypto user can easily defeat 1.  Monero, mixers, new addresses per transaction, new developments in the Bitcoin protocol.  Even if the transactions can be confidently linked to people, they can not be prevented.
I don't see where you suggest any law to restrict Bitcoin.  If 2. refers to market manipulation, sure, but without belabouring this conversation too much, that might shake out some speculators but not all and there is already a use case for noncensorable transactions that does not care about long term price.  This use case in itself means demand and therefore a non negligible price.

Most people do not own any and they have not really tried to understand.  Their exposure is the same as someone who has witnessed the crash from $30 to $2.  Negative but curious.  There is nothing really to feel negative about. Bitcoin is an inanimate code.  
At first it will come from people who can see past those things and want to dip their toe in and acquire small affordable amounts with long time horizons.  They will make best gains.  Then the negative sentiment will bottom out and price will rise slowly which will reward holding, slowly quicker, tothemoonguy will rise.  
Then bank FOMO. followed by a crash and then Central Bank FOMO cylcle and crash to final normalcy which is growth similar to the demand from in a global economy unencumbered by a central banking parasite. So at least 10% per year.

I agree with other posters that it is good to see quality discussion.
Alll hierarchical structures are fragile and immoral.  The only way they function is that the incentives for enough of all the players need to be positive or perceived as such.  Whatever party sits in the top power position must receive large incentive because why bother otherwise.  The next top levels (enforcers) must have outsized incentive.  A sizable proportion of the lower levels must receive or at least perceive positive incentive.  There will be many at the bottom levels who receive negative incentive.  Their labours are required to keep the enterprise intact, but they are net negative beneficiaries.
This is true in government and moreso in fiat banking.  Money itself is best when it is transportable; it really is just communication of messages.  Because fiat money is nothing more than arbitrarily credit/debit ledger entries, the management of these messages requires a very odd set of protocols to ensure scarcity, especially at an interconnected global level.  Krugman is correct; it is men with guns.  This is the connection between war and fiat money.
Who is in charge of the ledger is the highest privilege of power.  This is in fact the power that all others that can be paid for with fiat  money pay fealty to. Try to find someone who refuses fiat.  Wars are pretty much all about who gets to have that power after war.  They just requires legal tender enforcement within a geography.
The bottom line of all that is simple.  Nearly all of the participants in the global fiat hierarchy are rivals.  But they bind together as an oligarchy against the masses. The incentives for all but a few are negative and their participation vis gained through violent compulsion. 
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."
Bitcoin is that kind of friend to rivalrous fiat banks and to the masses. 
The Bitcoin protocol has sounder rules and is not infinitely hierarchical via a potentially infinite ledger and the rules enforcement is performed at the edge out in the open. 
Bitcoin has established a $100B beachhead.  I think that is already unassailable.  At another 10X,   the incentives to remain beholden to mass murdering enforcement of arbitrary and historically cheating fiat rulemakers flips over completely.  The exodus from global fiat will be stunning, rapid and insanely volatile. 
Why would China or Russia or Iran or Saudi Arabia or we plebs put up with US/European bankibt bullshit?  We only do so now to access the banking system. 
There could be some setback at exchanges but peer to peer Bisq is not subject to that, nor of course is the Blockchain.

Bitcoin is an open source fact.  It can not be bent by authority.  It cannot be disappeared into The Memory Hole.  It does not respond to authority. 
The only attitudes that anyone can have towards it is to use it, to program it or to fork it to a version that serves the user even more than currently.  I am hazarding a guess that's not Her Majesty's Bankers' attitude.
The power of the bankstate will be converted to the spending power of Bitcoin and/or it's ilk.  
When I am asked to load a file onto my machine by Her Majesty, while I am fairly confident it is benign, it pisses me off.  I won't do it.  I don't care what they think.  1) Because I don't have to.  2) They are evil and I prefer that their power become disintegrated.

There is a substantial difference between illicit and permissionless beyond a semantic one IMO.
Yes I expect orders of magnitude growth in Bitcoin and/ or other blockchain projects.  Number of transactions, amount of value exchanged, but more importantly in the variety of expression of commerce and human means.  
So as much as we can condemn ransomware, it does give a peak into the future.  Several years ago, WikiLeaks got its donation funding cut off by credit card companies.  Bitcoin donations saved them and the price growth gave them resources.  I think it is fair to declare that Bitcoin played a significant role in altering the course of world affairs.    
More obviously wholesome, are things like tiny payments to content creators not prone to private platform or payment company censorship.  Or, remittance of labour wage to places like the Philippines, Mexico and Africa free from predatory money transfer companies.  Or automated predictions markets, provably fair gaming, registration of facts like identity or ownership of land and paper assets.  
Get past the price noise.  This is world improving stuff, very important but very unproven, hence the hype boom bust cycles.  
By the way I appreciate a good conversation with nuance.  Many skeptical people just shout and fling their ignorant bias around.  
I like Bitcoin and I think it is wise to inform one's self and learn the basic mechanics, even if one does not take much stake in it.

So that is the fiat scam.  What limits a regular bank is regulations and that they only create money when it is demanded by a borrower which relies on the borrower making sound economic decisions.  All of that is riggable and prone to plain risk.  That is where the "genius" of a central bank comes into play.  A central bank has no such limits.  It can create whatever amount of money it wishes.  Legal tender law government borrowing and other law ensure demand for these imaginary accounting entries.  Regular banks then operate with almost no risk because they have the unique privilege of borrowing from central banks if they need to. 
When the US ended the Bretton Woods arrangement that limited fiat printing to a gold standard, the world entered into a new experiment with drastic consequences.  Since then all economic gain has been financialized, and has been captured by the 0.1% at the cost of the loss of the middle class and thereby the growing radicalism both left and right.  Almost every nation is failing in this fashion.
This is not a new phenomenon. It happened many times in history.  Fiat money is a scourge to civilization, the cause of much war and tragedy.

You don't understand what Bitcoin is. 
 It is money with it's own built in payment mechanism.  It is not a large scale payment network like a bank or Visa.  Because it is permissionless, it would be a piece of cake for Visa to build themselves on top of Bitcoin.  That won't happen in the short term until there is wider social acceptance of Bitcoin, which will lead to higher demand, lower volatility and futures markets to give Visa (or whoever), the predictability they need.  So the transaction capacity is perfectly fine for what it's doing. With planned and potential upgrades, the capacity can be made to be millions of transactions per day on the main chain.
Already, a low trust payment network protocol has been built with unlimited transaction capacity, Lightning Network.  It doesn't fill all niches but it could do much of what Visa does now at much lower cost.
The energy used to secure the network is alot per base transaction.  Probably higher than it needs to be.  I suspect that the inventor didn't predict this much success so soon when choosing the block reward which is big mining part.  Over time this reward tapers toward zero.  Lightning Network transactions do not have this cost and are no more energy intensive than me posting this.  Third party trusted credit companies like Visa would have Bitcoin credit transactions no more energy intensive than current Visa transactions.  
Your move dude, but you are going to have to up your game alot.  All you have offered so far is your juvenile ignorant judgement.

To be honest, go to Ethereum and EOS subreddits.
I think those projects are mortally flawed but the kinds of experiments they are doing is pretty impressive.  Using a general purpose money like Bitcoin as the basis for a subsidiary programmable transaction ecosystem is a very powerful idea.  Putting it on a side chain helps keep Bitcoin's blockchain decentralized.

The Fed is the central bank for the US and quite a large proportion of world trade.  The instrument it manages, the Federal Reserve Note (dollar, but not really), is the most important single asset type on the planet.  The people of the US are compelled to use it through various laws.  These laws are so effective that there is now for all intents and purposes a government enforced monopoly.  These facts alone should cause great suspicion.
The Federal Reserve is controlled by the 6 large Wall Street banks that having been proxied by Congress.  
The Federal Reserve banks have an enormous privilege.  They never can go bankrupt.  They choose which enterprises to finance and which to crush. They set interest rates in their benefit.  They fund government debt.  
Within a decade, Federal taxation will be about as much as interest being paid to banks assuming continued debt expansion and normalizing of rates.  
Some people got more benefit of the borrowing than they will pay in taxes.  You are probably in the vast majority that will pay more than you got.  
Under these circumstances we all work on the bankstate company farm.  We labour for their chits and buy from their suppliers with these chits and our grandchildren will pay the war debts of today or be thrown in prison.  
This is accomplished because the Federal Reserve can do whatever it pleases with its balance sheet.  In secret, unaudited.

I am in general agreement with one major quibble.  
The actions of the fiat bankers are unpredictable.  We might just as well get a severe deflation or a slow long lasting deflation or a hyperinflation. Their game is to get as many people as possible going the wrong way.  They harvest the weak and those at the fringe of the herd who think they can outsmart the banker-predator. 
I have decided that the best bet is to get out of the ring.  I don't wish to fight the Fed, for or against.  I am just going to participate in building the non fiat world and stop trying to predict what bankers will do.  
I think your scenario is most likely, but I am just want to no longer think about what the bank will do.

Not leastly that checkpoints need not be in the main client. They can be added from an adjunct utility and are only necessary as long as an attacker persists.  Even a daily innoculating checkpoint would defeat plans for attack.  
Bitcoin is always be what the community wants. If checkpoints are temporarily necessary to keep this attack from polluting the chain, I have little doubt that the community will adopt that technique. 
Miners' marginal per hash operating costs are probably not prepaid, mostly electricity.  Hashing out a fake chain vs idling and waiting for a market price increase would seem to me to favour waiting over harming that potential.

@_date: 2018-12-16 21:51:15
OK.  In a small privately company with more than one owner who have ownership divided by shares, (which is most of them), what do we call these owners.    Let me spell it out for you.  They are called shareholders. 
I have been involved with countless businesses structured like that.  
Private companies do have shareholders.  Your references do not alter that.  
You have never worked in a management position in any such company nor have you been a shareholder.  
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:33:20
Balance sheets balance.  Liabilities plus equity minus assets equals zero.  
Equity is really the corporation's liability to the shareholders in a floating amount (per the above equation) via shares. Very different mechanism than debt liability which are fixed.  
Liabilities are mostly payable in currency.  Their principle does not alter with interest rates.  
Asset values however are  greatly altered by the interest rate context.  Interest rates suppressed by central bank balance sheet expansion causes people and corps to acquire assets of lower performance because 3% performance can still be marginally positive.  Or consumption is favoured over savings.  
I have never lived in a world of market determined interest rates.  I was not yet an adult under the extreme deflation of Volcker and it has been inflationary ever since.  From my understanding, it was inflationary prior to Volcker.  
So our corporate balance sheet items are quite prone to interest rates.  Pertaining to this conversation, liabilities principle remains and increase even via interest and increase in real world value as interest rates increase.  And because debt is a bit more expensive the price the corp will pay to acquire the asset will decrease.
So in a world of low interest rates, assets are over valued and liabilities are undervalued in real terms.  A whole lot more of unproductive acquisition and consumption goes on.  
In a long term artificial lowered interest rates context, liabilities have decreased in real world value, asset values have increased.
In a normal, or artificially set high interest rates, these happenings reverse.  
So in a suppressed interest rate environment, assets are over valued and over consumption is going on.  I live in an area that undergoes boom busts.  Unemployment is high and increasing currently. Yet there is a construction boom happening due to cheap money.  
The Australian housing market demonstrates what I am talking about as Chinese credit is contracting.  
So it is not terribly useful to analyze anything macro in currency terms when interest rates have been zero for a decade.  It's not completely lacking in information but it is highly distorted.  
The system of overlapping fiat monopolies creates a complete fantasy economics and is set up to advantage the insiders.
Yeah, I prefer a base money system with clear rules, perfect ledger and defined inflation.   Of course, we are a loooong way to achieving real economic relevance but it's worthwhile well paying effort.

Eat or be eaten is not a goal, but a persistent thermodynamic and Darwinian reality.  
It persists in humans.
A strategy of self interested cooperation works better, thanks to language, time preference expression, abstract notions, etc, but the self interest is what makes it work.  
We do have an innate "humanity" as you say.  This knowledge of evil (note it is a curse in Abrahamic religions, Satan's temptation), burdens our thinking but frees our behaviour.  
It is unclear to me which is the actual repression. Are we suppressing humanity when we act brutally?  Or are we suppressing Nature when we act altruistically?  
In some way, that doesn't matter because both ends are served.  You do better and I do better with a negotiated cooperation.  
Better selfish economy is achieved (serving Darwin), and better humanity is achieved ( serving what? you will have to answer that because I don't think there is anything there other than religion, but I would exhaltingly consider your offer). 
In the meantime, on a practical basis, Marxism is a cruel Darwin-serving power structure, a lie of Utopia.

Effectively these price manipulations are a subsidy to long term holders.  So both Bitcoin and bullion are cheap, but you have to be prepared to wait it out.  The fiat scheme is self defeating, but it can last a long time.

Yes, balance sheets balance.  
What they don't tell is whether the asset can perform at the necessary rate to pay the required rate on the debt.  With zero interest, pretty easy, so debt amount expands.  But zero interest can not be kept up indefinitely. Keynesian economics succumb to reality.  People need returns.  
So how much of this debt fails when interest rates actually pay for the costs and risks?

I am going to respond here to your post below because for some reason I can read it but not link to it. 
First, great, I am glad you are curious.  
Second, why Bitcoin and not the others?  I am something of a reluctant Bitcoin maximalist.  There are interesting coins. I think ICOs are a great mechanism for raising funds though most of the projects were junk.  I like Monero. I like Nano.  However, it is clear that the cultural acceptance is overwhelmingly to Bitcoin.  That matters alot.  Bitcoin is adapting into the niches established by the various alts, but there are issues with PoW, so...
It's all really too early to tell.  
Even EOS is worth a sniff.  It may well be that that sort of aristocratic model will be what's necessary.  It can literally program almost any kind of crypto system as possible but you do have to trust an inner cabal to a pretty high degree. 
Do your own research, but Bitcoin is King.  That could change.  Someone who plays his cards right in this situation could make handsome fortune from his energies.

Geez, no wonder it fails.  Natural ecosystems are brutal economies with almost no time preferences.  Eat or be eaten. There quite possibly is no tomorrow.  There is probably no next summer.

Do you always just shift goalposts to save having an actual conversation.

Of course it does

Not really seeing it.  Miners who are no longer profitable won't be that interested.  They made their money and will probably wait contingently for price rise.  Harming Bitcoin for a small profit with a significant risk of getting burned in a short squeeze seems not appealing.  
Replacing a big part of the chain all at once is a big event and could be reversed within a short period with a checkpoint added, wasting the proofing energy done in the dark.  An expensive waste.  Would that shake confidence? Quite possibly.  Would that harm Bitcoin fundamentally?  Hard to say.  I guess it might scare people out of the community. Not me.  Whatever comes next, most likely an ever better Bitcoin is far too important and valuable to this world.  Any attack would require at least an equal amount of hashrate probably several times.  
The community could fork away to a better proofing method with a fraction of the hashrate.  That was demonstrated by the BU hashrate attack in 2017

You must be thinking of some Monero that I have never heard of because that's not Monero.

Is it USD or BTC volume.  They each would say something.  USD speaks to general adoption.  BTC speaks to redistribution cycle.  The two together would tell if Bitcoin is thriving or dying.

Good luck friend.  I don't see how anything good comes from an outlook that denies nature and denies reckoning with it's own failed experiment, but keep telling yourself that you are the better one. This is also meant in kindness.

I think we may be arguing past one another.  
I think that it's pretty poor civic participation to selectively cut payment access to people you disagree with.  So yeah, dirty pool by the payment companies.  But as your little pony pic suggests, that's their freedom.  
But we have freedom money now for us dirty anarchists, drug buyers, gamblers, capital control evaders, fiat haters.  And let's add (hateful adjective) speech to our list of friends.  
PayPal can go suck a pretty purple pony.

It's open source. After 10 years Bitcoin's blockchain is the only relevant blockchain in existence.

That is true.  It is about self preservation of material well being and and the rescue of my soul from fiat monsters.  We have enough testimony and evidence to see what is what.  Evil.  Throw up evil.
