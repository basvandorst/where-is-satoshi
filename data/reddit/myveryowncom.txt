i used my ledger nano yesterday without problems
@_date: 2016-08-22 09:55:19
no you connect the trezor/ledger hardware to electrum and manage addresses on the trezor/ledger .. you dont give electrum your seed
@_date: 2016-08-22 09:40:36
you can use the trezor with electrum and freeze addresses
@_date: 2016-08-30 09:19:04
yes, send and recieve working fine
@_date: 2016-08-22 10:43:23
yes create a new (hardware) wallet in electrum and select the option to use device that is already configured
@_date: 2016-04-22 07:47:51
you could run p2pool on it and point your asics at it
@_date: 2016-04-26 10:44:34
I wrote myself a bash script using the instructions from the slack .. works fine .. i dont use the client on Pi just the server with a ssl login

ahh yes ..they have a sudo missing .. so just run the last install command again with sudo 
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
sorry i had forgotton that

with wordpress + woocommerce + bitcoin way plugin .. you can sell downloads and physical media 
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:23:55
You give your website a master public key from an HD wallet .. or load your website up with many pre generated addresses, there is many ways at your disposal

The OS has to boot from an SD but you can run it from a usb 
I did this with a 128Mb Micros SD card and 128GB usb and had bitcoin running  .. bit i have since switched back to using the SD card for the OS and binary files and the usb for blockchain storage .. so i can easily change the OS or binaries and not have to worry about the blockchain

whoops ... 
@_date: 2016-01-05 17:53:21
You have to laugh ... the magic blockchain thats not a blockchain and its obvious they are unaware THE (bitcoin) blockchain also grows without transactions ... just look at the first i dont know how many blocks
@_date: 2016-03-11 18:18:25
if you have to recreate the redeem script from the public keys you will need to ensure they are in the same order as you used them originally.
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:25:03
mycelium or coinb.in
@_date: 2016-01-08 16:05:49
You could simply pregenerate a few thousand addresses and put them in a mysql table and serve up empty ones to new donators
@_date: 2016-01-15 10:14:59
RPi takes time to validate blocks .. expect it to take best part of a month to fully sync
@_date: 2016-03-09 09:58:29
p2pool can be run on the pi
@_date: 2016-01-10 10:37:22
here is the official magnet
@_date: 2016-01-31 12:27:55
You can run Armory offline on a Pi without the blockchain but if you want a full online version then you need to first make your pi a 
@_date: 2016-06-06 09:37:23
they are not halvening the dificulty .. its the block reward
@_date: 2016-06-02 13:34:21
you run openbazaar - thats all there is too it - you dont have to ask for permission .. have fun n good luck with your sale
@_date: 2016-06-26 00:52:29
as a last resort you can use  offline to get the private keys 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:29:04
you could just use the dumpprivkey command if you know the address that hodls the coins

Accept BTC directly, &amp; use multisig + hardware wallets
@_date: 2016-06-02 13:08:06
the amount of money you move is not relevant to the cost of the transaction which is generally a few cents

nah its 2 x 12 words - so 24 words -enough for a trezor .. well infact its the first 4 chars of each word x 24

I am learning bitcoin and python and when i use Peter Todd's bitcoin-pythonlib to break down a block and the transactions within it what are the first 4 characters in the variable x  when i take a CTxOut object and then extract from it the scriptPubkey eg when the CTxOutObject.nValue is 0 and CTxOutObject.is_valid()
x = bitcoin.core.b2x(myCTxOutObj.scriptPubKey)
If i drop the first four chars i find the OP_RETURN data then matches what is displayed on popular block explorers .. but what are those first 4 chars ?
Am i also correct to assume that a CTxOutObject with 0 value and is_valid() is an OP_RETURN?
@_date: 2016-02-29 11:46:57
Ahh that helps - thank you!

I use the Ledger Starter ISO to provision/restore a wallet so not worried about an evil computer stealing the seed
@_date: 2016-09-14 10:37:59
mycelium survived the update for me
coinbase, coincap, ledger and shapeshift apps loads fine
jaxx 1.1.0 seems to freeze at loading screen 
@_date: 2016-09-20 16:15:11
not that i know of .. but there is a tool you can download and use offline to generate your 24 word seed ..  .. or you can use the ledger starter .iso tool as it generates compatible 24 word seeds 
@_date: 2016-09-20 14:30:30
it was re released in the Apple app store very recently
@_date: 2016-09-20 14:29:54
it does not work like that - the last word of the seed acts as a checksum - so as i understand it you need to use a computer to generate/calculate the seed
@_date: 2016-09-16 12:30:42
mycelium, jaxx, airbitz, copay .. take your pic
I am using mycelium .. its fairly basic compared to the andriod version but it does the job
@_date: 2016-09-11 14:40:58
you could setup a pi with a 16gb card as a pruned node .. use  .. prune=550 in bitcoin.conf n it will only consume around 3gb of disk space 
@_date: 2016-09-14 09:57:59
mycelium on andriod lets you select to use the TOR network and will launch Orbot if required - sadly no such feature on the iOS version tho
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:02:54
thanks for this tool, love it!
@_date: 2016-09-15 14:47:50
pleased to hear it - will you allow an update to original nano?
@_date: 2016-09-15 14:00:26
I prefer Trezor as Ledger does not allow you to protect the seed with an additional 25th word (password)
@_date: 2015-04-01 21:22:28
Its a choice ... using multisig technology you could help to make it transparent - an agreed % goes to administration and running costs and the rest is spent on charitable use .. its fixed and does not change and as long as the funds are handled correctly - eg responsible fair people with more than just one or two administrators required to sign they then keep each other honest .. of course the floor is the human element
@_date: 2015-09-13 21:59:04
Great to see this and I have sent a £1.
A qr code would be a good idea and blockchain spits out images you can embed

here is some more info to help ... 
@_date: 2015-09-14 16:04:10
it uses master public key so can see what addresses are receiving but does not have private keys so can not spend
@_date: 2015-09-25 14:57:53
This is good news but it should be standard practice across the industry!
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:05:43
mycelium gear uses the xpub key from your mycelium wallet - so you can see/spend the coins direct from your mycelium wallet or make a watch only wallet if you want on a second device

thank you, i will give this a go!
@_date: 2015-09-14 09:54:55
Bitcoin way works well - mycelium gear is interesting too .. depends if you want fiat or bitcoin ... if bitcoin then Bitcoin way will suit ..if you want fiat then mycelium will convert to EUR.  Use Tails and electrum 1.9.8 to generate xpub key compatible with bitcoinway

you provide no information on the number of inputs in your transaction ... so its hard to comment on the fee you paid

you would need to edit the woocommerce_checkout php code in the plugin editor - not sure exactly what file 
if you change the form elements to be hiiden but populated you wont see them - just leave email un hidden .. i suggested populating to prevent form validation errors by simply hiding the elements

What commands should i use to update my RaspberryPi2 ?  i really dont want to redownload the blockchain but dont mind re compiling as OP_HODL is awesome!
Will git clone -b 0.11  get v11.2 ? or is there another command i can use to update?

I am using a 128Mb SD card with a 128Gb USB stick - syncing the blockchain is painfully slow but i a now upto block 330333
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:42:58
Why not create a wallet with something like mycelium and then have a device that contains only the master xpub key in the restaurant - customers can pay - and as its not possible to spend the staff cant steal it
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:31:37
Is this the first spent coinbase?

exactly hash is another word for cannabis,

wordpress + woocommerce + bitcoinway plugin will allow you to sell downloads or as already suggested satoshibox.com is good way too

Spotted a typo for you .. Biggest User Baseand Acceptance should read Biggest User Base and Acceptance
@_date: 2016-05-15 22:43:15
As an idea ... you could enable "guest checkout" and then modify the checkout page to make the form elements hidden and you could also populate said form elements with some example data to prevent errors  e.g. address could be '123 Abc Street' etc
@_date: 2015-10-27 11:19:10
Forget mining, you need to spend a lot and wont make ROI with difficulty increases ... just buy a bitcoin and make sure you control the private key
@_date: 2016-10-25 11:28:28
it is not free to send bitcoins - there is a fee you must pay depending upon the size of your transaction, not its $ value.  If you are paying with the equivalent of a bag of pennies it will cost you more than using a single input larger than your output
@_date: 2015-10-15 15:20:55
yeah i am patiently waiting ... and waiting ... getting on for a week, has crashed a few times but a reboot gets it going again, perhaps next week it will become a fullnode

You can select using coin control in which order coins are spent - but if you dont override the default is kinda FIFO

with a tablet device on site there is no need to use bc.info and generating a qr code on a device for a given amount is pretty easy staff n customers should find it no more hassle than using the other terminals they have for other types of payments
