$180 woooooooo ��
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:27:31
Now I am glad I waited and I’m also glad I accumulated for about 6 months before the end of this last bear market.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:32:01
Very first day I finally decided to buy bitcoin.  I invested $1000 (it’s a lot for me) and about 4 hours later the price falls $800 and fell by $1500 over a 48 hour period.
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:23:29
I’m not going to be worried unless the price falls below $9600
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:12:46
Their currency is called the dong? Lolol!!!
@_date: 2018-09-07 08:44:36
It’s CNBC.... oh.....
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:14:28
“Buying dong....”. What an unfortunate name for their currency
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:23:53
�� isn’t a highly inflated dong good for international business though?
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:53:49
Bitcoin is not going below $5,000....
@_date: 2018-09-12 03:31:29
Nothing is more libertarian than a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:47:59
I had like $800 in Ethereum ��... wish I had put it all into bitcoin but I thought diversifying a little bit would’ve been a good decision.
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:40:31
Well the folks who bought at 19 won’t break even for a while.  I’m talking about as long as the drop doesn’t go below $6,000 we could still be looking at a potential bull market because we would have a higher low than the last sell off.
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:45:32
Bitcoin has lost like $800 in value over the past 25 hours
@_date: 2018-09-06 01:58:39
I hope your right.  Ethereum has by far been my biggest loser.  $800 invested now worth about $400.  If it gets completely wiped out so be it I guess.
@_date: 2018-09-06 04:22:01
Yes I know! It really sucks to be me right now because I thought having diversity in your portfolio was supposed to be a good thing ��.  There goes $800 into Ethereum...
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:19:05
I’ve invested into stocks, ETF’s, bonds..  I also invested into crypto as a hedge investment.  Most of my investments are in ETF’s, stocks and bonds.  And they ARE diversified.  I don’t have all of my money in single stocks, or in single ETFs that would be retarded.  I thought the same logic would apply to Crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:09:23
I bet even a half of bitcoin is almost priceless in Venezuela these days

CNN is fake news
@_date: 2018-09-07 08:47:50
This is why I fucking hate the media. They lie all the time and they don’t even care if everyone knows it.  American news media has become mere tabloids.  Actually 1990’s national enquirer is more credible than American news media outlets these days.
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:39:46
As long as we stay above $6000 for the dip we will be alright.  Right?!
@_date: 2018-08-09 09:12:18

@_date: 2018-08-09 08:43:45
You must watch RT if the news has been telling you that Putin is a good guy.  Oh well.  Just wait until that soon to be 22 trillion dollar (and constantly climbing) debt bill comes due.  When it does you’ll see that all of those “truthful” politicians and media that told you national debt wasn’t a big deal leave you out in the cold with all of your paper cash.
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:50:58
Yes.  The market is just cooling off after the large gains made over the past few days I expect in a day or two the price will move to the $7500 range
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:04:12
It was a market bull manipulation probably but the fact that we broke through 6800 and beyond is a good sign that the bulls are trying to work the price up higher
@_date: 2018-08-28 03:07:27
Yeah when I first invested into bitcoin the price was 7,500 and literally 4 hours later a sell off happened and the price went down by over 1000.  I literally had to talk myself into making an investment for weeks and when I finally did price immediately dropped so I freaked out but I kind of knew what I was getting into.  
I continued to make smaller purchases as the price continued to fall to shore up my losses so I’m finally back in the green but just barely.  
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:25:30
Wishing up to what? Bitcoin is still over valued?
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:19:57
What does “price is being manipulated by whales” mean?  Speculators? Hedge fund managers?
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:56:45
Not really.  Inflation can only go so high before the fed has to raise interest rates.  Which makes you pay more money if your mortgage isn’t locked in.
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:04:56
Yeah I’m staying in.  I just have an eerie feeling that all of this craziness is just a bunch of market manipulators who are trying to shake off and flush out as many people as possible so they can take an even larger share of the market.  These huge downward trends tend to happen all at once with massive sale offs within the course of 3-4 minutes.  It’s not organic at all.  The market is being irrational because manipulators are making it that way.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:39:26
Ok.  That’s how I invest in my stash account weekly contributions of $50 dollars and once every other month or so I’ll put in an extra 200 one week.  Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:02:29
When were these predictions made?
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:19:46
Can you transfer bitcoin from Coinbase to square?
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:40:20
Well McCafee honestly sounds nuts.  I fully believe it’s possible for bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the next 5-10 years but $500,000 by 2020 is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-08-09 05:07:30
Do you think that bitcoin is a losing pot?  It has 200 billion dollars of market value still and experts including Bill Gates have mentioned that they think that crypto could be a solution for developing nations that don’t have banking infrastructure or nations that are undergoing civil war and even countries with collapsing economies like Venezuela that have hyper inflation.  That means that currencies like bitcoin may always have value.
@_date: 2018-08-15 03:19:38
It’s actually called the diamond-water paradox.  That is an economic principal.  
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:00:36
Not true.  I’ve invested my own money into companies like Nvidia and Square and they have made good gains.   It’s all about studying the economy and knowing where we will be 10-20 years from now technologically.
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:22:46
How can we do more to spread the word and use of bitcoin?  I’ve talked my brother and dad into investing into bitcoin but a lot of people especially in many places on Reddit seem to be too scared to even make small investments.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:52:56
True.  
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:05:16
No honestly you don’t stand to really make much more money doing that. Just keep buying in small amounts
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:05:25
I purchased some at 6,200
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:03:32
I can tell you.  Very important.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 08:38:08
Lol I know right?  I’ve been debating on wether or not to invest in bitcoin for probably close to a year then I finally summon up enough courage to do it and then this happens.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:07:21
What just happened?  Bitcoin lost like $250in value in the last like 30 minutes
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:27:18
Well how can you own bitcoin these days unless you purchase it using fiat?  And why buy bitcoin in the first place if you can’t convert at least some of it into fiat?  There really isn’t a whole lot of places right now that accept bitcoin as payment.  It seems like some people just have it for sentimental reason.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:44:46
If you look at dollars it’s not much different.  75% of wealth is in the top 20% of people while the bottom 80% have the rest.  The dollar is only backed by faith.  Faith is intangible no? Bankers and private equities are a very small portion of people compared to everyone else right?  Relax.. don’t invest more than you can lose but relax and wait about a year or two.  You’ll see..
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:24:59
That’s was 2 and 4 days ago.

I only owed $1000 on the first mortgage
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:46:57
Yeah I agree with this.  ETF’s could greatly help stabilize the currency and make it a more tenable currency for commercial use.
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:01:57
I thought bitcoin wasn’t supposed to run out until like 2140?
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:57:10
I don’t have a computer setup that could do it efficiently enough to make any sense.  I read that it costs more money in electricity for an average joe to mine it than it’s actually worth because big businesses have setup huge powerful bitcoin mining operations 
@_date: 2018-08-08 09:42:10
Yes I knew the volatility in bitcoin and I have been investing in stocks, ETFs, and bonds for over a year now.  I’ve seen volatility in stocks but just nothing like bitcoin.  It will take some getting adjusted to but I’m prepared for the long haul.  If bitcoin dives to $5,500 I plan on buying about $3-400 more.
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:57:47
This is the best investment advice I’ve seen on Reddit so far.  And not just for bitcoin but any investment.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:59:30
Lol I’m disheartened but I plan on buying more soon.  Honestly it’s during these corrections when you should buy more.  
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:14:54
Was the good gains today just a good entry point for short sellers?
@_date: 2018-08-08 07:28:45
Just bought bitcoin and ether for the first time yesterday.  I knew it was volatile but holy shit...  I spent 1000 dollars and I am now terrified.  Well maybe not terrified but definitely uneasy.  I could lose 1000 dollars and not suffer that much but shit..
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:42:46
Paul Krugman is also wrong with his predictions a lot.  According to Paul Krugman the stock market should have shed 20% of its value during 2017.
@_date: 2018-08-15 07:15:28
I don’t think there will be only one and I don’t think that having only one currency to use is a good idea.  I think having at least one alternative is a good idea.  Having 200 alternatives is just nonsense though..
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:51:23
I have a wife and kids and even though times are rough for us right now (im a welder and my wife is trying to finish her teaching degree) something has just been telling me that even though it’s a risky investment to at least give it a try so that my family may have a better future.
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:30:47
The only examples I’ve seen of people buying say a car is by exchanging their bitcoin for fiat then purchasing.  There simply isn’t enough businesses accepting bitcoin as legal tender right now for many things.  Perhaps there are places in Los Angeles or New York where bitcoin has a lot of places that accept it but not where I live and nowhere close
@_date: 2018-08-17 09:13:45
Auto correct

My investment into Square’s stock has been insanely successful.  They have grown by 120% this year
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:04:46
We’re back over 6500.  Are market bears losing momentum?
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:58:02
Not good.... you should hedge your investments with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-08-16 02:37:48
Yeah I’ve noticed that.  But I’ve also noticed that the $6,000 bottom seems to be defended pretty well. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:02:49
Thanks.  Yeah I have like 30,000 saved up to buy a house when my wife gets out of school but in the past 8 months that money has only gained like 2 dollars in interest so I’ve made investments of about 3,000 in a few stocks but mainly in bonds and ETFs.  But I took 1000 and went into bitcoin and have the intention of making smaller contributions in increments of 100 once a week for the next 10 weeks.
@_date: 2018-08-09 06:21:41
Thanks for the info
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:12:56

@_date: 2018-08-17 07:24:30

@_date: 2018-08-17 07:25:46
Maybe your right...
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:34:49
Look at what I said.  Not terrified but uneasy.  Who wants to lose 1000 dollars?
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:53:03
I mean I love these bitcoin puritans passion but let’s be real.  If bitcoin can’t be used in most day to day transactions then your dream of having an alternative to fiat currency will never come into existence.  What would be the point of owning something you can never buy a house or car with or even groceries for that matter?
@_date: 2018-08-10 07:54:37
I don’t want a Lamborghini.  Cars depreciate in value so badly.  I want a 2500 sq. Ft home on about 20 acres though.
@_date: 2018-08-28 17:47:05
Usually if you see one huge candle stick up or down it means that a manipulator made a huge trade.  It’s like if you see that $300 million dollars of bitcoin was sold over the course of 5 minutes that’s when you know someone who owns a huge amount of bitcoin made a trade.
@_date: 2018-08-08 23:37:05
When is a good time to buy more bitcoin?  Like at what low point do you or other people that you know who invest in bitcoin plan to buy?  I think I read somewhere that if/when it falls to around 5,000 it could be a good sign to buy 
@_date: 2019-11-08 18:25:20
Hey didn’t Soros buy a ton of bitcoin back in 2017 and shortly thereafter buy a huge stake in Overstock.com after it announced it was going to start accepting bitcoin as payment?  The guy is a snake and a great deceiver.

So it’s .22 now?  I just saw an article that said if you own .28 you will be in the top 1%

Yeah but then the problem becomes where to buy t if not on Coinbase
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:25:02
Oh well there is no electrum iOS app for iPhone..
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:32:06
So with all of the people out there who want bitcoin is it even possible for an average joe to own an entire bitcoin anymore? I mean there are so really big players out there.  I think the winklevoss twins own close to 200,000 bitcoins

@_date: 2018-10-15 23:53:50
This was great for today but will this also add volatility?  I know that may sound like a dumb question but hedge fund managers can control such huge amounts of wealth and can create havoc sometimes.
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:17:57
People who call bitcoin “bitcoin core” are probably bitcoin cash trolls.

That’s an endorsement bitcoin could do without.  Dorsey runs twitter like its his own fiefdom.   Censorious, hypocritical, drunk on his own power.   Literally everything that bitcoin is supposed to fight against.
@_date: 2019-02-06 03:28:15
Until someone like Dorsey gets his hands on it and by using square, and using connections in Silicon Valley he and his buddies control huge amounts of hash power and then they do what they always do.  Deny and deplatform whoever they don’t like.  I’m telling you this asshole is the type that is making connections with huge crypto banks and mining companies and will use square as a bitcoin dragnet to get as much as he possibly can so he and his other tech cronies can deplatform any wrong-thinkers.   They have god complexes.

Why is Warren Buffet so against bitcoin in particular?  He talks about how terrible it is but he has never given any concrete evidence of why, in his mind, it’s so awful.  He has said that blockchain is a very useful technology but doesn’t describe how it’s so important and then proceeds to dump on bitcoin.  
Buffet is a very good investor and it worries me about his negative outlook on bitcoin but it also seems to me that it is impossible for him to understand the great potential of an international currency with no middle men. 
Does anyone have an opinion on this.

In my opinion America is just the figure head of the world financial cabal that is the IMF.  I truly believe that we have been used as the global attack dog for a multi national entity for quite sometime.  
Pure democracy is mob rule.  A constitutional republic has been the best system of government the world has yet known although overtime it developed cracks that are exploited.  Eventually it, like all great nations, will crumble and if that is in my lifetime I am glad I have begun to prepare for it with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-06 02:00:21
Shit... I absolutely hate Dorsey.. censorious, drunk on his own power, a psychopath.  He is the last person we should want in bitcoin.  He is a control freak.

It was hard for these banksters to see the potential of bitcoin a few years ago.  Honestly when I first heard about it I just thought it was a fad.  That was back around 2015.  Wish I would have invested in it then.  
The more I’ve learned about it and the more I’ve seen people who have been utterly ruined by their governments uncontrolled debt and spending turn to it as well as people who have been deplatformed by different financial institutions the more I see people distrust in the global fiat money/ power scheme.
One day the US’ 22 trillion dollar (and climbing) debt will come due.  And on that day I will be happy that I chose to invest in bitcoin.

Bitcoin has already broken market trends during this halving period. And not in a good way.  To push bitcoin to $100,000 levels would require enormous investment.  Probably a market cap of 800 billion in bitcoin alone.  I’m not saying it can’t happen in 5 years but it will take a lot more global interest and institutional investment from people who aren’t interested in just shorting bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-05 20:23:44
It took about a year and a half.  Some months when I had extra money left over I would buy up to about $600 - $800.  Other months I couldn’t buy anything at all.  But normally I would spend around $400 a month.

Looks like it’s going to be a rough next few weeks.  There are many experts expecting huge price drops in bitcoin in the next week or few weeks.  
We have the halving in a few months and many bitcoin enthusiasts and experts have warned that 
If bitcoin performs poorly or even falls in price during and after the halfing it will cause institutions to flee, many individuals to flee even many of the OG whales.
Who knows what 2020 holds but either way it’s been a fun ride for the 2+ years I’ve been involved in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-05 20:25:42
Honestly I’ve probably broke even for the most part.  When I first bought the price was around $7500.  4 hours later the price collapsed about $500.
@_date: 2019-12-24 21:50:05
I know how much BS is out there.  I am more skeptical now than ever because all the bitcoin experts are saying “fuck the fundamentals the technicals say MOON soon.”  I don’t think this is goo.

Tbh that long period in the 3000’s helped me out a lot because I made my first purchase back in June of 2018 and literally 4 hours later the price fell from around 7800 or so to about 7000.  I was absolutely terrified.  
Back during this last run up I did Fomo when the price was at around $12,000 and put in a lot more than I could really afford.  After a few panic sells and getting rekt I swore that I wasn’t going to buy anymore and let it just run its course.  But of course about 2 months later I was buying again.

Ok.... look at this “bull run” compared to last and tell me that we have just as much interest going into the halving as we did then.   We don’t..
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:32:13
Why?  This halving is not like the last.  There isn’t much room to run given the current interest and that there isn’t much more development that can happen with bitcoin.

Theoretically you are right.  But if that’s the case then why wouldn’t it have happened yet?  For a market as young as crypto and small comparative to other global markets it should be rather easy to do this even with the threat of whales dumping the price.
We will see what the halving brings.  It will become much less profitable for miners so we will see many exit the crypto mining business which (also in theory) should mean that there will be less of a chance for miner capitulation that gave us our last big dump.  
I hope you are right I just have no idea.

I bought in when the price was just under $7000.  Have been making small purchases here and there for the past 2 months or so.  Plan on buying a little bit this afternoon and a little bit tomorrow because I haven’t purchased any bitcoin in about 2-3 weeks now...

I mean honestly.... he sounds either nutters or like he is absolutely trolling.  In two years I’m supposed to believe that bitcoin will be that valuable?  There is no way.. I really don’t like it when prominent people mislead others like this.  
Crypto currency is the most risk-on asset in the world and with world wide economic growth slowing down do you really think people are going to be putting their extra disposable income into the most risky asset in existence?
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:50:04
I too am bullish long term and I believe in two years bitcoin could be at around $15,000 even with a depressed economy but I think that 1 million in two years is just plain crazy.  
I hope bitcoin does well and sees further adoption but I don’t want to promise people the moon and then feel like crap if people lose their hard earned wealth if things go south.

I also have been thinking that bitcoin was the very first crypto currency.  Since then there have been no regulatory barriers to entry and so there have been efforts out there to create crypto that addresses all of the flaws of bitcoin and thus creating better products.
@_date: 2019-01-14 12:47:25
I understand the reasons why bitcoin was created but what I am saying is that as time goes on and bitcoin becomes harder and harder to mine the rewards will go to the ones who have greater and greater hash power.  The field of bitcoin miners will shrink and shrink as it becomes less affordable for smaller miners to make a profit which will mean larger entities will control the production of bitcoin.
These larger entities will be forced to comply with all of the regulations put on bitcoin, including proof of transactions, and exchange regulations,  and will completely destroy the idea of anonymous transactions and a decentralized payment system.  
How can this be remedied?  Bitcoin like all crypto has a scalability issue but bitcoins scalability issues seem more dire than most others.  I hope I’m wrong but I read an article on coindesk that discusses this very thing and the author makes a good point that bitcoin may inevitably become a natural monopoly.  That is it may only be profitable in the end to have one single entity control the mining process.
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:17:14

Well that’s good.  I guess I was just kind of worried because of how much it already costs to mine bitcoin and with the halvening that is coming up it will make t even more expensive to mine which will cause a lot of people to leave the space.
@_date: 2019-01-14 00:01:19

The dollar is backed by faith and the dollar has collapsed multiple times in the past.  We are 22 trillion dollars in debt.  Venezuelan currency is useless yet bitcoin is almost priceless these days there.  The same could happen in America.  Especially considering countries are buying less and less of America’s debt.  The shit is about to hit the fan as we are getting further and further into uncharted territory.
Don’t make the mistake of assuming the dollar is invincible.
