I'm kinda impressed they got the url Gemini.. anyone want to venture how much they paid for that?
So much better sounding than their Index...Winkdex.

..and you think that makes them care less about making good on their investment... ?  
I think they'll try to do whatever they can to get that price back. ;)

not launched, not regulated.. at this point.
An invitation to sign up to a future exchange, beta no less..
I get the parenthesis implies perhaps it will be regulated, and that is their "mission", but at this point, this whole title could be parenthesized.. 
Now, how a regulated exchange will ever work in this space.. is a whole other argument.

What's just as illuminating is there's been a few posts on /bitcoinmarkets calling out activity on Bitfixisin.. and they aren't ignored. they're **deleted** by the mods..
Mine was observing the crazy volume discrepancies and how the pumps were always starting on Bitfinex.. 
be warned. this could be the next Mintpal.... "Oh we have to close down while we check things"... gone.

1. clicks the user's name, no other posts about a company X posted.
2. no reason to go further. see 1.

you got reddit gold for this? lol. 
Kasparov coulda retweeted this not even knowing what it is.  
He doesn't have a changetip account either so.. Hopefully he signs up, gives his information, etc..
to collect his .25 cents.

what you need to look at here were bulls willing to spend 7-10 dollars over bottom to save a waterfall. 
Anytime someone is willing to pay 5-10 points over the gap... there's a reason.
Bulls basically save corrections like these all the time.  They pay premium and then set up walls to try and drive the price up. it works less and less though.

are my USB backups even secure...?
sounds shady as hell..
@_date: 2015-02-02 16:34:31
rhetorical question..

What happened on the other exchanges has no bearing on what I said. 
Watching Stamp live. dropped to 246. and buys immediately went in around 253.  Why not just buy with the bots instantly correct to 247-248..etc.  Why pay "extra"..
This happened twice btw within a 15 min. space.. wasn't hard to miss. ;)

funny you're downvoted...
People usually laugh when one says SHA-256 was developed by the NSA.. until they realize it's the truth.

the same exact thing could be said about people who buy 1000 coins when there is no action... a full 30 out of 60 minutes with no trades prior... That happens on Stamp. If that whale just bought slowly he would most likely get a better price overall.... but they're either not willing to wait. or trying to cause a run.. short squeeze.. etc.
Don't forget. mining companies do sell on exchanges. despite some people saying the contrary.

so huge then?
just someone was saying Kasparov retweeting a tweet about changetip was "the biggest news yet" last week... so I wonder how big this will be..?
