That *is* one theory, but nearly every reference shows the $ symbol originating in Spanish America, so it seems unlikely.

When I worked at Wendy's, the store float was around $1,200 I think .. between what was in the tills ($125 each), and coins/bills in the safe. We didn't get a *lot* of $100s (because most people don't carry around $100s; ATMs almost exclusively dispense $20s), but it usually wasn't an issue making change. If they'd been working a while since the last cash pull, they could probably make change from their own register; otherwise, we'd grab change from the safe. One time, though, we got a $100 not long after the store opened in the morning, and had to give the guy his change all in $5s.

All you need is a public/private key pair. The public address is what allows someone to send you coin. The private key is what allows you to spend the coin.
It can be on your computer, on a flash drive, written down on a piece of paper even.

People "doing their own research" on a subject they have no background knowledge of is how we ended up with an army of soccer moms convinced vaccines are poison.

I don't need to, because nowhere does the guide suggest there's a limit. Absent any law prescribing a limit, there is no limit. That's the only reasonable interpretation.
You're linking to a section about the capital gains deduction, a mechanism that allows you to deduct an amount in respect to capital gains from certain transactions, meaning you would pay *no* tax on that disposition. This is not relevant to Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a qualified small business corporation, farm or fishing property.

You either misunderstood what your accountant told you, or you need a new accountant.

Robinhood's been around long enough, involved in stocks/ETFs, that I don't think they're running some ponzi scheme on its users.

I used to work at an engineering firm that was doing work with PDVSA. What a fucking shitshow. All the layers of bureaucracy. They were consistently, like, 365+ days, past due on anything we billed to them.

Good thing we switched to plastic fiat, here.

There's no dollar limit to capital gains. The difference between your gains being taxed as capital gains vs. business income is if it's deemed you're carrying on a business (e.g., daytrading).

50% of your gain is included in taxable income and taxed at your marginal rate, which will vary depending on which province you're in and your income level.

Robinhood's not an exchange, it's a brokerage. That's like comparing E-Trade to the NYSE.

So you have an address with 1 BTC, and you want to send 0.25 BTC to somebody. What would happen is there would be a transaction with 1 input and 2 outputs. The input is your address with 1 BTC. The first output is for 0.25 BTC to the person you're sending to. The second output is to an address you control (it can be the same as the one you sent from, though some will say you should never reuse addresses for privacy and security reasons) for the change. The difference between your inputs and outputs is the transaction fee that goes to the miner who mines the block your transaction lands in.
