Reserve one for me, I'll buy one.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:31:59
Great stuff, please let me know when its available.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:17:55
Yes please!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:03:55
Very helpful, thanks for the link.

Just hang in there. If you believe in the vision and the long-term future for Bitcoin then nothing has changed.

For all those people who said they wanted the price to dip so they could stack up... well now its time to put up or shut up!

Its locked in at time of purchase.  The value may change but the number of coins will be the same at time of purchase.

Happy cake day!  
Here is my question, if Bitcoin software is permissionless, what's to stop someone from intentionally, or unintentionally, putting code in place that would harm Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-20 23:37:58
Seems like a steep markup. I wonder how many they sell at that price. In this case I would only trust something directly from the manufacturer. 
@_date: 2015-05-27 13:16:03
Noob question, how can you check if an address has been used before?  Also is multisig the same as 2 factor authentication?  Thanks for the help.

The Circle (or any other commercial entity) angle was a simple way for people to open purchasing/spending accounts who don't have bank accounts or credit cards.
If you sell gift cards with a preloaded amount of Bitcoin on them, how do you account for the price volatility?

Used Fold app today for the first time at Starbucks. Worked well and saved me 20%.  I understand they are also looking to add Target and Whole Foods. That may be interesting to users in the Seattle market. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 23:46:04
I'm here now, sorry I'm late!
@_date: 2015-05-12 20:59:26
Thank you for all your efforts here. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:01:29
Very helpful, thank you.
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:49:30
I see you did cover this after going back in and looking at the wallet discussion.  Thank you for including storage method information in this article.

This film did interest me in Bitcoin to the point I researched it and after getting comfortable with the basics I bought some so from that perspective the movie is having an impact on Bitcoin acceptance.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:56:04
It worked, thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:04:44
Just found this, looks like someone already figured it out.  
@_date: 2015-05-09 16:52:15
I've been using Airbitz now for a while and really like it.
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:39:31
As a newbie to Bitcoin, the biggest hurdle that I struggled with (and somewhat still do) is keeping them safe.  There are so many differing opinions on cold storage methods. For me, deciding how to get them was easy, where to keep them is a bigger challenge.  I didn't see a reference to that in the content but please let me know if I missed it and I'll go back and read it again.  Thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-27 23:44:10
Done. Thanks again for keeping tipping Tuesday going. A matching program would be a great idea.

Didn’t boomers create the delivery vehicle for your meme? Just sayin.
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:03:18
I want as many people as possible to understand and use bitcoin and I see memes like this as counterproductive to that goal.

As a miner have you received any requests from individuals who want to buy your newly minted coins without transaction histories?
@_date: 2015-08-12 02:39:52
I like AirBitz.  Easy to use interface, includes the Bitcoin directory and their customer service is great.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:22:23
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:22:13
Serious question: how do you know they are old coins?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:14:32
Schweddy balls recipe included?
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:12:20
Looking for a decent writeup on quantum computing and cryptography. Any suggestions?
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:55:15
That’s good news, I’d like to get one!

I HODL my Bitcoin on a pc in the dump. They are very secure. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 00:06:15
Maybe I missed it but where does the Trezor come into play with the casa node?
@_date: 2019-01-11 20:44:36
Upvote - great job. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:55:35
Any prints available?
@_date: 2015-04-28 22:48:25
My first Bitcoin tip, thank you. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 17:37:06
Upvoted! Cool stuff 
@_date: 2018-12-13 23:52:37
This is great. Any update on print availability for the Finney version?
