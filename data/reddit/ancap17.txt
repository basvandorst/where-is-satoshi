Bitcoin Cash vs every other crypto is no different than Bitcoin Core vs every other crypto

You're an idiot. Trades on exchanges aren't executed on any blockchain, so of course BTC and BCH will trade at the same speed.

That means Bitcoin Core is the worst since it's the most ill-liquid

r/Bitcoin is the r/politics of the crypto community, and I don't mean that as a compliment. r/BTC is more like r/Libertarian.

No, its true. Just look at this:

How? Coinbase is offering a new product and supposedly criminal?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:47
How is it a complete scam? It's a legitimate alternative to Bitcoin Core, it has faster transaction confirmations and lower fees hence the name Bitcoin Cash.

The blocksize was never meant to stay at 1MB however

There's a reason more people counterfeit US Dillars than Yen

Litecoin is a Github fork lol. Bitcoin Cash was a community driven hard fork based on core philisophical differences on how to scale Bitcoin. It's like a river splitting in two around land mass. Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond are trash coins with no community backing with the only goal of discrediting Bitcoin Cash as another trash coin. IMO, Bitcoin Cash is superior to Bitcoin, whilst Ethereum, Monero and Ripple are each superior in they're own ways.

Bitcoin Cash shares common blockchain history with Bitcoin, there's no need to use Litecoin

Bitcoin Cash is not an altcoin because it shares the first 478558 blocks with Bitcoin. Denying Bitcoin Cash as a member of the Bitcoin family of coins is like denying your brother or sister is a member of your family because they're a member of the opposite political party than you. The superiority compared to altcoins is that it is a member of the Bitcoin family. It's like comparing US Dollars to Japanese Yen, people prefer Dollars because of it's name brand. The better the name brand, the more likely more people and places are willing to accept it.

That's a different kind of fork, not a hard fork. Litecoin has no lineage to Bitcoin except some software similarities.

If anything Core devs and blockstream are destroying the potential of Bitcoin by constraining the blocksize to 1MB. Seriously, if core devs increased to 2MB, Bitcoin Cash wouldn't even exist.

Go to r/BTC

Segwit is not the type of scaling solution Satoshi envisioned however, and considering how much work went into Segwit you would think BTC would have affordable transactions by now. Bitcoin Cash solved this scaling solution so much more easily.
