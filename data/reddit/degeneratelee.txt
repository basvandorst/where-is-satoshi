(And regarding the tax payer $ thing... I **do** agree that in a society where tax payer $ is truly put to use correctly that you'd be right here... like someone getting disability $ + free electric for themselves but has a business on the side they're sneaking $ in from... well, in a world where tax payer $ are REALLY used all for going back to the community, I'd agree 100%
But man... I just see the government as so fucked up and wasting soooooo much tax payer $ on absolutely ridiculous things.... insane military costs, the president going on his 1000th vacation (despite hating trump this has **nothing** to do with him. If the pres pays their own vacations then I'll admit I'm wrong on a single point but my point stands).... rich super powerful people doing things and making moves that only make themselves and their equally rich powerful friends richer.... I see it as SOOOOO much more $ going towards BS like that
Therefore,  people "abusing" their foodstamps,  poor people getting welfare even if they're selling drugs on the side/working under the table... literally anything that the far right normally bitches about tax $ being "wasted on poor people"
**NONE** of it bothers me because i figure if they don't get it, the government's rich and powerful are going to blow it/use it to help themselves anyway... you know?

Nah, I'm happy as fuck I haven't lost any $.
Stability in my investment is good enough for me. Because I can't save $ for shit besides this investment and it's about the only "stability" in my life lmao
(Wtf feel like I've had this account for ages...? "Redditor for 3 months" holy shit,  see and that's **actually** the most stable thing in my life
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:59:20
Yeah.. so it's extra cheap when you're in jail or whatever the fuck they do to "electricity abusers" and then it's absolutely free forever guaranteed! 
@_date: 2018-10-28 08:09:44
Fuck yeah stability✊
@_date: 2018-10-27 07:48:59
Damn that's fucked up dude. I could totally see government officials, literally anywhere in the world, yanking the power cords and cutting them off with a saw (prays for those divine lightening bolts that **I** have always been threatened with) and leaving her food to rot
The fat cats **need** that extra electricity you know!? And even if they don't it's better that the power used to maintain it just goes up into the air, after all, what if all their neighbors then THEIR neighbors found out! ! My god... oh btw please go to deep freeze  and get my filet mignon... fido is hungry

Ahh, I didn't know about the fire hazard, so it's similar to wiring a breaker to not trip when you have too much shit on it, thus bypassing the safety feature, or even like having to where it trips all the time as that in itself is dangerous? (Obviously it wouldn't "trip" for her tho)... so I assume it's because it's making the lines too hot by running more then they're meant to handle? (I assume that's kinda what a breaker is for, right?)
Or is it entirely different then that?

Maybe I'm not interested in sex without a relationship, and the emotional connection and having a loving friend is all I want.
Sex without a relationship is **so** fucking empty, and not satisfying whatsoever
Ha and people always make fun of/give **me** shit about my username/post history

That's why I make girls think that I'm poor + a cheapskate  before dating, to ensure they want to be with me only for me
I mean, I actually really am poor + a cheapskate; but that's beyond the point

Cool ride amigo! Lambos are overpriced rich douche trust fund baby rides at best, and midlife crisis baldy mobile rides at worst as far as I'm concerned anyway...
(Jealousy for no moon or lambo of my own escalates)
But nah I really do think sports cars that are that expensive are douchey
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:57:30
I was quite clearly joking.
I have no plans of ever being rich in this lifetime (or any other lifetime), and I truly don't care about $, well aside from needing it for a few things. 
But if I could either gain $1,000 or see bitcoin succeed globally I'd pick the latter. Now for $100k I'd reconsider because I am poor as fuck and truthfully will probably never own my own house lol. I set the bar low so that I'm ~~never dissapointed~~  ~~sometimes disapointed~~ *always depressed and miserable*

Lucky. I've been holding since when it was $6k somewhere between 6 months and a year ago. It's down fucking 33% and now **my fridge is practically empty, containing only sorrow and broken dreams of a lambo**

Gherkin? Gherkin my yerkin with the false promises of a lambo is the only Gherkin I've seen around these parts!! 
"Just buy a single bitcoin" they said
"There aren't even enough bitcoins for every millionaire in the world to have one" they said
My supremacy over millionaires feels a bit lacking at the moment, fucking MLM pyramid scheming scheisters!
