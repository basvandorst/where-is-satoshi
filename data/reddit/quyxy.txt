I hate the amount of shit kraken is getting from people who don't understand that this site is just flooded with newbs. Yes they aren't living up to their claims, yes they should have better costumer support, yes there are a lot of better ways they can handle their problems than they do now. But as it stands, kraken is still one of the best exchanges out there, and as the CEO himself said, you should give them more time to catch up and avoid using them right now, cos you'd be asking for problems if you do.

That's the equivalent of saying "I haven't had any problems with bomb yet, it didn't explode or anything so I'm fine for now"

My tip for 2018: Do NOT use coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:38:44
Then you should wait until you have enough money and use kraken. In a month there will still be plenty of coins around that are worth investing in. Don't let the FOMO get the best of you and don't use coinbase

No.1 rule of investing in crypto: do not invest what you can't afford to lose. Sounds like you're better of not investing anything at all. Also the fact that you know see the problem with coinbase tells me you don't know a lot about the crypto market and I encourage you to get educated a little more before investing. As I said, don't let the FOMO decide your investment, cos if emotion is the driving factor then you'll panic when the price drops and you'll end up losing money because of panic selling

Why don't you take a look around. You would need to make an effort to ignore the amount of controversy around coinbase right now. Just to name a few:
-High payouts being "lost" (look anywhere on the coinbase subreddit)
-Failure to adopt segwit, causing a complete stop in their transactions for a while (
-Stupidly high transaction fees
-Very poor costumer support
-Investigation for insider trading with bcash

NOT on coinbase

I'm EU based so this might not apply, but my best experience so far is with Kraken and Poloniex. No, they aren't perfect either, but their issues are not as destructive as coinbase's
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:01:29
Cos you have no patience?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:58:51
They are the biggest and they are the no.1 place for new traders. This is beyond not doing the community any favors, this is causing people to lose faith before they even start.

Imagine if menu cards were all on tablets to give you the last update on their price and you'd try to avoid ordering until the prices correct

If you are in it for the long game, then all the more reason why you want to stay away from coinbase.

Gdax is connected to coinbase. Why are they so popular? Because marketing and because they have the prettiest charts and buttons. Use Kraken.

Stoooop usiiiiiing gdaaaaaaaax

You are doing a very good thing leaving coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:03:18
Guys I cannot stress this enough. STOP using Coinbase! There are many other exchanged that don't charge these stupid high fees, that don't send your info to the government and that are more secure. Pretty looks are deceptive
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:13:23
People, please STOP using coinbase/gdax. The sooner you get out the better
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:27:01
Indeed. Funny how all these "financial experts" give their predictions and they turn out to be wrong time and time again. Now I'm sitting here laughing to death and waking up richer every morning for doing jack shit
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:11:43
Here is my suggestion. Do NOT use coinbase. They are the most popular most one of the worst exchanges out there. Just take a look around here and see how much money is being held hostage by coinbase/gdax
