If you have ever been on a rollercoaster you know that the fun part is always going down.

Bluntly put, yes.

Funny *that* you should mention... Is what he probably meant.

Hi (sorry for bad English)

But isn't this a good thing? I know the legality of bitcoin is pretty fuzzy nowadays but this article seems to be some good news for us (for a change). Am I missing something here?

Porn.com’s latest figures, however, provide evidence that refutes this claim.
Isn't that what a successful publicity stunt does tho? Increase sales due to a good marketing move? Not that I'm trying to undermine this at all, we all need to support bitcoins wherever they appear. Might as well see some boobies for our troubles in the meantime.

I would like to see some percentiles on sales tho. I'm sure they have gone up, but I doubt it was by the total $ amount of bitcoin sales. No doubt some people who would have purchased with dollars opted to pay with bitcoins instead. Either way being one of the first major companies to do transactions in this new currency is a smart idea, there is a lot of community support, and this community has some deep pockets.

Wait, your account is disabled as in you cannot even get in? Is it deleted and your funds just poof, disappeared? If that is the case then yes, this was is fraudulent.

Exactly, I cannot begin to understand the audacity of this guy. And it's not like it even makes sense. He is blaming the board that he is on. That's a friend/co-worker I would gladly do without.

I have been out of the circle for a while now. Recently sold all my bitcoins, however keeping my dodge for the novelty aspect, the reason I mined them in the first place. Could anyone point me in the direction (links or any of the sort) to what shady things moolah has been doing? This is quite interesting.

I love the emphasis on the NEED! I mean I didn't want to watch some porn, but if you insist ;)

"With bitcoin 0.8.0 (released 19 feb 2013) a breaking change has been included that would prevent transactions to be accepted if their signature did not include the right number of zeroes in front of the signature values (in an effort to reduce risks of transaction malleability). We did not notice this change but a few of the transactions we were sending would become invalid because of this."
Am I the only one who thinks this is ridiculous to ever come out of a CEO's mouth? The man deals in bitcoin -» bitcoin update brought changes -» the man didn't bother to look at what was changed -» piss everyone off. He is either incompetent, or he is bull shitting us. I highly doubt that the largest exchange at the time of the update couldn't spare a couple of developers to read through the update. I mean c'mon there are people on this subreddit who have read it and they don't even get paid to do so. In my book Mt. Gox is dead. They need to turn over everyone's bitcoins (no it is not okay to withheld peoples property) allow to sell, and finally die off. It served it's purpose. It is the cocoon of this crypto-butterfly and now we must shed of it. 
Edit: fixed typos caused by pissed off spelling, thanks Mt. Gox!!

I submitted my ID and it was approved in less than 1 hour. Guess it's really hit or miss depending on the load. I'd assume they will be pretty packed these next weeks.
