If Satoshi registered bitcoin.org would it stand to reason that namecheap knows who he really is?

You are quite the artist!! Try using Swype on your android phone it helps to eliminate the periods instead of spaces because it adds the spaces automatically! ;D

So I think I understand this, although in a fairly rudimentary fashion.
What if there are three wallets. Lets call them A, B, and C.
So they each have a starting balance:
A - 10
B - 5
C - 2
if A sends 3btc to B, B now has 8 coins and A has 7. (not accounting for fee's for the sake of whole numbers)
A - 7
B - 8
C - 2
Now if B sends 3 coins to C, whose to say whether the 3 that get sent were the 3 that B got from A, and not the the 3 of the 5 that B started with?
Maybe I don't understand this well enough, but if someone takes the time to clear my understanding up that would be greatly appreciated.

Starting to see that this is the way to go.

Yeah I have never done any day trading. But I do work in front of a computer all day I thought it might be interesting to try since I can keep an eye on it! I do appreciate your insight though! Thanks!

I think it would be cool if reddit gold could be bought with BTC. (Unless it already can and in that case please forgive my ignorance.)

So basically I need to have more coins in my coinbase wallet than I would want to sell back.
Can you suggest an exchange where I could trade ups and downs? If so, is there a way to transfer the btc I got at coinbase to the other exchange once it's actually in my possession?
