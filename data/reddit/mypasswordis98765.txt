Why those numbers? The price would probably be higher, but nobody knows what it would be. The relationship between marketcap, price and invested money is more complicated than people think. Just think how when somebody sold 30,000 bitcoin recently (12 million dollars) the marketcap dropped by 25 percent (more than 1 billion dollars).

No. I don't. The point I'm making is that it's impossible to estimate those things, because the underlying mechanisms are very complex and mostly unknown. I still have no idea, how you came up with your numbers, but if I pulled a random number out my ass right now, then this 'estimate' would be as good as yours.

I don't know what you mean by "challenged". But I'm pretty sure that you cannot reverse a SEPA transfer once it has been processed (i.e. the recipient got the money). If there is fraud involved you might have other means of reversing the transfer (police, courts) but your bank won't do it for you.
It is however important to note that there are SEPA debit transactions, which are altogether a different animal. In a SEPA transfer person A sends money to person B (transfer intiated by person A). In a SEPA debit transaction person B (most likely an institution or a store) debits the account of person A with a certain amount (transfer initiated by person B). While the former transaction is not reversible by person A, the latter however is (which makes sense because the latter transfer wasn't initiate by person A).

That means Bitcoin would be worth more than the amount of US dollars currently in existence. This could only happen if Bitcoin replaces the US dollar and becomes the new world reserve currency. While this is  possible I doubt that it will happen anytime soon.

Well, as I said there is no chargeback. Once the payment is made (i.e. once the second party recieved the money) there is no way that the payment can be reversed (without cooperation of the second party).

While that is correct, it is not the definition of a chargeback. In a chargeback (such as it is possible with credit cards or paypal) the money is credited to the other account and then "charged back" i.e. removed from the other account again and credited to the original account.

Nope. Doesn't exist. A Sofortüberweisung is simply a SEPA transfer that is initiated by a third party. Why anybody would ever entrust their sensitive banking acount information to a third party is simply beyond me, but that's a different story.

There is no such thing as making a chargeback on an Überweisung (wire transfer). Those are not like credit card payments. Once the payment is made, it is final.
