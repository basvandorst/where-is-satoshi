Good effort!  Looks great, but you really have to do this without having the user enter their seed.  That's poor security practice for the user and too much liability for you!  If something goes wrong in the code now they can come after you!  Presumably they're holding more in their electrum account than they'd want to keep on their phone, so entering their seed on their phone should be a deal breaker.  Great thing about Electrum is the Master Public Key method.  Hopefully you can figure out how to get that implemented.  I was hoping to see an Electrum watch only wallet come out for iOS.  Post here again when it doesn't require the seed.

You should not be reusing addresses for privacy reasons. You are, however, right that you would be fine with only one backup if you always reuse addresses.

Agreed.  I think it's an admirable goal for fault tolerance, but people are unrealistic.

I agree that given the new "rules" Coinbase or Bitpay could work with pot dealers and be fine, but the new rules violate existing laws.  This may be a political disagreement, but the administration doesn't have the authority to nullify federal law.  Coinbase, Bitpay, or whichever financial service firm would still be in violation of the law.  If the administration changed their mind about enforcing the law they would be screwed.  They're looking for reasons to shut down Bitcoin businesses.  They can't afford to give them one.

They only hold an encrypted copy of your private keys. If you have a strong password they can't take your coins. That said, they or sw ody who hacks them could just serve up some malicious JavaScript and they wouldn't even have to go through the trouble of decrypting a wallet. So it's a semi trustless arrangement where (if you don't review the code each time you log in) you trust they only ever get access to encrypted private keys.

I know it uses 160 bit shortening hash so the final address appears to have 160 bits of entropy, but my understanding is that the digital signature algorithm that underlies all of it has only 128 bits of entropy.  When you start with something with 128 bits of entropy you can't add to the entropy later even if you add to the address length.  And a quantum computer is worth fearing because of it's ability to halve the bits of entropy in a brute force attack, as you indicated.  If you're not talking about a brute-force attack, do you know of a significant algorithmic weakness in ECDSA that can only be properly exploited by a quantum computer?

The concern wouldn't be about where you get the bitcoins from so much as where you send the bitcoins to.  If you let your addresses be publicly known and then do something unsavory.  Not even illegal necessarily, but something you wouldn't want your mother to know.  Well, if your mother knows the address you re-use she could see where your spending your money.  But if you don't care for anonymity, the other reason would be to help protect the anonymity of others.  If your addresses are publicly known and you do business with somebody who wants to keep things anonymous you would be a link to them.  It hurts network anonymity.
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:49:08
Great to think this way and I agree the step change in rewards is ugly. That said, ignoring tx fees finding a block becomes half as profitable after a halving. In a perfect world miners will respond and the hashing power will halve. You're describing a massive overshoot if 95% of people drop. The difficulty change is rate limited to 1/4 of the previous difficulty. In your scenario we'd have a couple weeks of hour long confirmations, but people are smart. They'd turn their machines back on in response. I think the most we could expect to see in response to a block halving is a difficulty halving that has little to no effect on the network.

Just remember, the most important thing you can do for bitcoin is pump the price up. Haha, I get not wanting to lose your position in btc and I replenish my stores for that reason, but this is silly.

@_date: 2014-08-08 16:36:54
Ok, I get what you're saying.  The signature algorithm only having 128 bits of entropy despite being 256 bits was something I read on reddit recently that sounded smart so I believed it but it looks to be wrong (commented that yesterday).  Are there any known algorithms to jump from the public key to the private key of a 256 bit public/private key system that aren't simply brute-force?  My understanding of quantum computing (and I admit I may have an incomplete understanding) is that it essentially reduces the power of the number of steps required to perform a calculation by 2.  e.g. brute forcing a 128 bit key takes as long as a normal computer would take to brute force a 64 bit key.  So without a new algorithm to solve the problem, it depends on how "intractable" it is on modern computers.  If bits of entropy is a measure of intractability and it's 256 bit, it would be 128 bits for a quantum computer and still intractable.  It sounds to me like we're largely in agreement that you're taking a needless risk when reusing addresses, but without understanding the algos used to crack private/public key encryption it's hard for me to say how big of a risk.  If it's exceptionally intractable now it may still be intractable with a quantum computer.

Fair amount of resolution, but you also used decimal points.  Now imagine buying a candy bar with bitcoin. 0.001 BTC.  When I buy a candy bar I don't think "I'm spending zero point five seven dollars".  I think to myself "I'm spending fifty seven cents" since cents makes more sense in that context.  If bitcoin is successful it will have staggering growth and we'll have to keep shifting the units used (BTC --&gt; mBTC).  It takes time for people to develop new new units like pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, dollars, thousands, millions, stacks, etc. Let's just make it easier on ourselves and use gigasatoshi's.

But a bitcoin is impractical as a unit for almost everything.  You'd have to be transacting about 5k to have 10% resolution when using bitcoin.  We should switch to satoshi's since it's the real unit of the currency and use metric prefixes.

Honestly I don't know much about compression methods, but even if the blockchain can be pruned and compressed, the txs have to be relayed to the node in full.  That's where the 4 GB number I gave came from.  Any compression would optimize how it's stored on the phone, not how it's relayed across the network.

I would go in the opposite direction and say people overemphasize the seriousness of a 51% attack.  If a miner somehow gains 51% of the hashing power, all he can do with a coinflip level of success is double spend as an individual.  Of course, if somebody has 51% of the hashing power we know his name and he'll go to jail for theft.  Not to mention a successful attack like that would crush the price of bitcoin and make his hashing power worthless, more than overcoming any monetary gain of his theft.  In short, I'm more worried about distributing bitcoin nodes than hashing power.
@_date: 2014-08-08 18:32:24
That's only because blockchain.info is behind the times nowadays.  Use a BIP32 wallet to prevent address reuse.  If your friend is only using one address, as is encouraged with blockchain.info, it's trivial to see how much is in his pocket.  Blockchain analysis will always be possible, but BIP32 wallets make it much much harder to accurately say how much somebody has in their wallet.  If their transaction uses multiple addresses, all you'll really be able to say is that they have somewhat less than an ice cream's worth of money.
EDIT: Privacy is a shortcoming with bitcoin that continues to be addressed.
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:44:51
In a word: poorly.  Many bitcoiners have this misperception of a world where everybody stores a complete node and mines on equal footing.  Technology doesn't make that possible.  Mining, no matter the algorithm, can be optimized and centralized.  The blockchain will grow to the point where dedicated servers run full nodes and process transactions.  While it's not necessarily desirable, it's not the calamity people make it out to be.
@_date: 2014-07-22 03:47:39

It did.  That's true (although you could debate about the true cost of a bitcoin during the price discovery phase).  But then again, everything that previously had no value to increase to have some value has by definition experienced an infinite growth rate.  Could it happen again?  I think that's more akin to the question of can lightning strike twice.  I am certainly optimistic about the long term growth potential of bitcoin, but 100,000% increase in ten years is wild, unrestrained growth.  Ultimately, if bitcoin is your retirement plan I think you need to explore a few backups.

This isn't really a hard fork requirement since bitcoins don't exist at all in the protocol, only satoshis, but I'm 100% on board!

 I did not get a message using the word stolen.  I got a message saying a bitcoin transaction had occurred that I didn't initiate.  I looked into it further, and it does not appear there was a security breach.  To reiterate, blockchain doesn't store my unencrypted private keys so I didn't panic.

Isn't this related to the recomputation of the Merkle Tree?  When the extra nonce is incremented the Merkle Root needs to be recomputed.  The number of computations in this recomputation is related to the power of 2 under which the number of transactions lies.  It only makes sense to add in transactions in powers of 2 as a result since you don't want to slow down finding a block unless you get a sizable number of transaction fees for it.
@_date: 2014-07-29 01:25:35
Why? I've moved away from them because of the phishing scams and the fact that they STILL haven't implemented a deterministic wallet.  I've had it happen before where my browser generated a key and I used it and it never synced back up with blockchain's servers.  I know it's unrealistic to expect perfection when the browser syncs my encrypted private keys back with the server, but perfection is what's needed.  I'm just lucky I realized it didn't sync back and I manually wrote down the private key.  They need to move to deterministic wallets!  Great service with that one big flaw.  Now that HD iOS wallets are available though I've moved off blockchain.

Best answer, because it's an experiment.  It's moved into the mainstream media, but if you review the infrastructure there is still a ton that needs to be developed before it's at all usable.  That coupled with the fact that a simple bug in the code or stray remark from a federal official could ruin it makes it something worth "limiting your exposure to".

Be careful what you wish for.  We want certain aspects to get locked in stone before widespread adoption.

Would this really make you any safer from brute force attacks anyway?  As a general security practice, address reuse is probably a bad thing.  My understanding,however, is that that's because public/private key crypto is probably weaker/less safe.  That stems from the likelihood of finding a mathematical attack against ECDSA public keys though, not a brute force attack.  Other than that btc address only have 128 bits of security due to the digital signature algo used and all addresses (public key exposed or not) would be vulnerable.  Is that right?

People need to understand what miners can and can't do.  If a miner has less than 50% of the mining power, they basically can't do anything.  If they have more than 50%, the owner of the pool can pull of double spends.  They can't give themselves infinite bitcoins.  They can't change the rules.  They can only double spend.  And presumably we'd know the director of a pool with more than 50% of the mining power and he'd go to jail.  Miners are important, but I don't think they're as powerful as people make them out to be.

Oh if there's evidence of a forged real life signature I'll change my tune a bit. Although I'm not sure how you can get a time stamp for a physical signature. In my book if something is signed in the traditional sense, if you've put your name to it, it's valid.

Shill? Just saying I don't own ethereum. I got Bitcoin Cash and I got a wallet and now I have it and I can sell it if I want and get more Bitcoin Core or whatever I want.  It was a decent chunk of change I didn't want to miss out on.

If you disagree you should use the free market to make that known, drive down the price, AND make a few bucks.  Sounds like a win win.  If you disagree that is...

Bitcoin Core currently has 1 MB blocks and there's a lot more people wanting to make transactions than space for transactions in a block, so you have to pay a 10% fee if you want to send a small amount of money like $50.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:43:36
It depends.  What kind of fee did you attach?  If you put in a low fee like $1 or $2 bucks miners aren't going to touch your tx.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:25:17
Interesting thought. If miners moving to Bitcoin Cash drives up fees on Bitcoin Core is that going to drive users over to Bitcoin Cash and drive up the price, moving more miners over to Bitcoin Cash?

So ultimately, after all these scripts and nodes, etc. our money is in the oracles hands? He alone has the power to determine who wins? This isn't decentralization and honestly it seems like all the computation and ether isn't necessary. Why not contract with the oracle directly and cut out the network full of middle men?

If you're the only one who can read it why does everybody need to store it for you on a Blockchain? Store it your own damn self!

Most of us already do own both since Bitcoin Cash is a fork and not a premined crappy altcoin.  I'd encourage you not to lose track of your August 1st private keys.  I think your point is good that Bitcoin Core is useful for large transactions and has great branding and network effects.  Bitcoin Cash is good for large and small transactions, but most people don't know what it is, even those who own it!

I bought a few things back in 2014, but fees are really high now so I'm just holding.

Apparently.  I think I've seen the ethereum guys talking about their Bitcoin 3.0 platform already...
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:30:32
True, depending on the price of guac

Net neutrality is a rule. Not a law. Much cleaner to pass. No public input required.

Kinda funny to leave this as your last comment before going away for two years...

He didn't go to jail for bitcoin.  He went to jail for a crime he committed to make money.  I wish the best for him, but he's not a martyr.
@_date: 2015-03-31 03:35:27
Evil is personal opinion.  Crime is not.  I don't think he really hurt anybody (except his business partners) but he knew what he was doing and it wasn't for charity.  The only reason to handle clearly illicit transactions was profit.  He's helped give bitcoin a bad name in my opinion.  Hopefully he learns and bounces back from his mistakes.

What is the reddit double spend problem that needs to be solved? You want a decentralized passively managed reddit. Why a Blockchain?

Worked out well for him though that they didn't have the time to prosecute.  Probably helps give a lighter load to the guilty ones.  
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:09:06
Naw, he had plenty of opportunities to avoid the thug life.

Wouldn't you just need to use a deterministic wallet like Electrum to carry across a near infinite number of brain wallets with just twelve words?  Why bother with all this book stuff?

This video is way to critical of Bitcoin for bitcoin.org.  It's not that I disagree with the content necessarily, but if people see something that isn't flatly positive on the bitcoin.org site they'll assume that even the community has its doubts.

I bought a few ASIC miners a few months ago for fun.  I'm coming at it from a hobbyist perspective.  It gave me a reason to make a raspberry pi and it's a tool to help explain bitcoin. I agree with the consensus that mining is NOT a way to make money.  If mining were easily profitable, more people would jump into it for the profit motive, bringing the difficulty back to the point of unprofitability.  The problem with that is people who are mining solely for profit compete with people like me who appreciate the money, but also get a psychological "profit" from the fact that we're engaging in mining and helping secure the network.  If mining is designed to be only barely profitable from a financial perspective, throwing in a few kooks like me who don't mind a small electric bill/monetary loss and any chance at a profit is severely diminished.
You can make money if the exchange rate shoots up, but even then you're losing money relative to buying BTC's directly.

Bitcoin-QT should remain one of the wallets mentioned on bitcoin.org, but it should be in a special category for "power users".  In truth, the hard drive and time requirements of the client are an awful introduction to the currency.  Beyond that, it's critical that new users are immediately introduced to wallet security.  This isn't where Bitcoin-QT shines.  New users should be pointed to a service like Electrum, or at least Multibit.  Bitcoin QT shouldn't be on their radar.

Yes, but the odds that they've programmed an app for their android that would allow them to seamlessly double spend are incredibly small.
