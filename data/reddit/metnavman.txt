Not gonna' lie, I thought I was looking at an r/circlejerk post when I first saw this.
Best of luck on your run for office!

Not gonna' lie, this comment confuses the shit out of me.

I get weird, every time I read the posts about mining hardware, and the mad dash to get in on it before the next difficulty jump. Part of me wants to take the liquid capital I have available and jump into the party, but another part sees a wedding fund, paying off some school loans, things like that. It would be absolutely amazing to be able to say "FUCK IT" and drop everything and dive in head first.
I truly envy my fellow man that is able to experience this chain of events from that angle. Life happened to me a few years too soon, and I'm now regulated to picking up the occasional coin, giggling at my crappy mining pool, and watching the fireworks from the sidelines. Melancholy is a good word for it.

What tempname said. The ones that aren't likely knew what they were getting into anyways, and aren't worried, since the pendulum for bitcoin swings both ways.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:02:52
Most of the "mainstream" businesses are using services that instantly convert the coins into fiat. They bypass the volitile portion of bitcoin. Some of the more "fringe" businesses are probably doing what they want, and are more interested in bitcoin gaining traction than anything else. 
The bitcoin swing going on this weekend is nothing new. People who are shocked/scared/unsure about it haven't spent enough time with it. I wouldn't stress it too hard. If the businesses were worried about it, they likely wouldn't have adopted it in the first place.

"Never keep all of your eggs in one basket" is a commonly accepted strategy for most people here. Honestly, it's really up to you, and how much you trust your ability to keep your money secure.

Have a "robbery wallet". Have it loaded with a single Satoshi. Mugger will look to see if they've got all your money or not. That moment of distraction is your time to act.

Which, judging from the incoming difficulty jump, and subsequent jumps, will likely be next to worthless for the amount of money they cost vs. time it will take to actually get to you/get producing.
Buy coins. It's mo' betta'!

We will crash exactly X times, minus N number of times it doubles in value, give or take Y^2.

If you were truly interested, you probably should have gotten the ball rolling on this a while ago. Doing your research would've quickly illuminated the fact that getting into BTC with USD is currently anything but "quick", for the majority of avenues available.

It got me to download the entire blockchain. I didn't understand it, but I let it run while I read up. Afterwards, I was happy to be contributing to the network! 
I read up on mining and thought "I can do that!" I'm part of a pool now that lets me put my paltry ~160Mh/s to use doing something. It's not netting me much, but dammit if I don't enjoy reading the statistics and seeing things happen before my eyes.
People who are TRULY interested in it RIGHT NOW will jump through the "hoops" as it were to get into the project. IMO, those people are the people that deserve to experience Bitcoin right now.
The writhing, frothing masses will have to learn about Bitcoin one day soon enough. I wouldn't worry about what people are doing right now. It'll streamline itself, as the demand for mass-education rises. Have some faith. :) I've been around a couple days now, and I'm already a die-hard believer.

This subreddit suffers the same fate that all of Reddit has suffered over the years. I've not even spent "that" much time here, and can see the effects that the "slobbering masses" have. This subreddit started out very small and very focused, quite similar to Reddit as a whole. Now, popularity has spiked, and the bandwagon is weighing down. With that comes both good and bad. 
It's very much a double-edged sword, in the respect of "you either clamp down hard and deal with the consequences, or let it sort itself out and deal with THOSE consequences." Having not been a part of the r/bitcoin community for very long, I've already seen/made comments on things I've seen that flabbergast me about certain aspects of the community.
* The BTC-e "troll box": What about that is professional? Letting that be one of the first things newcomers to cryptocurrency trading see simply screams "this is internet neckbeard-retard territory, do not take it seriously." 
* The insane amount of people who apparently throw every dime they have available at buying into the party. No investor in their right mind would tell you to do this for *any investment anywhere*. Why the flying fuck do people think it's a good idea for this? The memes and posts crying about this do nothing to help either.
* The ludicrous amount of people asking innane questions about unbelieveably easy subjects related to Bitcoin. This isn't AOL. You are not a 70-year old grandmother who's never set up a router without calling customer support. You can take the 20-30min required to learn the basics of the system/find answers to your basic question. If you're having a hard time grasping the concept/getting your lazy ass in gear, bitcoin may not be for you anyways. Stop making posts about it.
All that said, I'm for a little bit of extra moderation, but with that moderation, some "moderation" in the moderation should be taken(harr). If there's a meme on the front page about some crash or "hold fast", that's fine. However, lets get a kabash on the 5-6 other memes that cover the same subject. Same goes with the 10th iteration of the same question asking "should I buy in now?" or "how do I cold storage?" Just my .02..

Mining for bitcoins with anything less than professional-grade ASIC hardware is pointless now. If you're interested in Bitcoin, your best option is to purchase some.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:36:56
Sure, but that's what IRC or other "shrouded" chat channels can be used for. The ease of use of the site, and the general layout not withstanding, it still reflects poorly for a new person to log on and be greeted with "LOL FUK BTC BUY LTC NIGGR FGTS". Sure, that would likely be the exception and not the rule(sometimes), but seriously, it's not needed. 
You wouldn't walk onto the NYSE trading floor and start yelling across the way "FK CRAPDONALDS STOCK OLOL BUY ARBYS BITCH". A lot of negative vibes come along with Bitcoin. One of them that doesn't need any further reinforcing is the "internet basement neckbeard nerd currency" stereotypes floating around.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:39:40
At which point I'd have to ask:
Who holds control of the wallet where the bitcoins are collected, prior to a winner being drawn/announced?
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:59:58
Because link karma. The story has been posted here multiple times.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:41:10
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:44:52
You sure did type a whole bunch to say basically nothing.
Tl;Dr - Stop posting memes, you angsty nerd people.
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:16:46
My estimate is based off the current difficulty of bitcoin, the current price of bitcoin, and the estimated difficulty increases. There won't be any new major ASIC miner tech hitting the playing field before you hit your timer. If bitcoin goes back up around 800+ per, you'll be profitable sooner.
China is not moving against BTC. Money will come back into BTC from China, once they get their kinks ironed out. Keep mining. Keep holding. Don't buy anymore equip. If you have an itch to spend money, spend it on bitcoins directly. You'll earn the most money purchasing coins, as opposed to trying to mine them.

I've purchased multiple coins/amounts from them, and have been with them long enough to unlock 10BTC a day instant-buy. Not a single issue whatsoever.
Most people don't read the fine print about how the system works for their first month doing business w/coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:34:16
Okay, then with the benefit of the doubt:
If you're mining with/making what you described below:
- 4 50G/hash miners
A bare minimum of ~124 days to make your money back. No, I don't think you should sell anything. I think you should hold until the theoretical time frame when your equipment should've made it's money back. Re-assess in March '14.
@_date: 2013-12-21 00:45:19
You're either a piss poor troll, or an idiot with more money than sense. Oh wait, 13min old account. K.

For most "normal" folks, like me with my 2 gaming rig GPUs, it's already far past that point. For a lot of people who jumped in with early-gen ASIC stuff, it's already reached that point as well. The folks that are still making good turnarounds on mining are sitting on serious hardware that costs multiple 10s of thousands of dollars. The tier above that group are multi-million dollar setups that you or I couldn't dream of touching now.
Bitcoins will be mined until the last one has been uncovered. From there, the network will be kept online by folks hashing for the simple sake of keeping the whole thing afloat. Transaction fees, sake of mining, etc, etc. It'll never reach a point where "no one" is doing it.
Well, not unless the whole thing shits the bed here in a month or week or year, but I imagine **someone** would keep at it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:04:55
There's so much information available here and other easily-accessed sites linked in this subreddit. If you're truly interested in Bitcoin, take a bit of time and get educated on it. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:15:10
I can't believe they keep that chat window on the "main" page like that. It's completely unprofessional 99.99% of the time, and really reflects poorly on the site for anyone researching around. My first time on that site, all I could think of was "here's the dipshits that will make the first impression for many people regarding Bitcoin."
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:19:27
There are a couple articles floating around on major news sites detailing the growing number of "legit" businesses that are beginning to accept bitcoin. I actually just linked one a couple minutes ago from CNN.com detailing the upcoming "Black Friday" event. Show them some of these, and basic educational/walkthrough write-ups for the concept of Bitcoin.
Welcome to the next "generation gap"!

If this actually happened, and the OP held on until this past week, they're currently sitting pretty. Congrats to them. They gambled and won.

Sounds like the million other scams that run rampant in EVE Online, a place where regulation for this sort of thing is basically nil, just like bitcoin.
Without a 3rd-party Escrow or other such service, your idea falls flat on it's face. Best of luck though, there's a sucker born every minute, indicated nicely by the post count this has generated.

From an evolutionary standpoint, life tends to strive towards the goal of using as little energy as possible to accomplish everything it needs to do to survive. It's all about being efficent.
From a human standpoint, most people really don't like change/things that affect the "stability" that they have in their lives
From a cat standpoint, fuck you, feed me.

They'd have to dump a LOT of money into getting the whole thing off the ground, not to mention squashing the major media coverage that Bitcoin is already starting to attract. 
Ballpark your idea for a year from now. Say a bank started TODAY, doing exactly what you're talking about. Do you think they'd be in a position to challenge Bitcoin in one year? Where will Bitcoin be, popularity-wise, one year from now? Two? 
It's a free market. the multitude of altcoins is proof of that. Can that do it? Possibly. Will they? Who knows. Will it affect Bitcoin? Doubtful.
