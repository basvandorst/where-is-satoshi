Do you mean BTC Is or is NOT legal in the Netherlands?

I guess there's nothing stopping you from buying/selling cryptocurrencies online, but when you change that into fiat money, do most countries have clear legislations on how to deal with that? Most do not outright ban it, so how do the banks deal with large converted currencies suddenly landing in someone's account? Is it on a case-by-case basis?

Wouldn't Dogecoin or one of the other altcoins be a better medium than BTC in countries with currencies like the rupiah?

Not to dampen your enthusiasm in any way, but Dutch payment processing is actually really cheap. Debit (called pinnen here) is everywhere and credit cards are hardly accepted except in department and high end stores. Payment processing for merchants costs a fixed amount per month (mid double digits) and each transaction is something like a cent each for large volumes. So much that most supermarkets want you to pin no matter how tiny your purchase is. So the current system is still fairly competitive in terms of prices ...

Is this only for Starbucks in the US?

I'm not referring to the article specifically, clearly withdrawing cash is not an issue here. Was thinking out loud from a post from a while back when someone converted a large amount into his bank account and got questions about the money source.

Thanks! Was MIT also the school that gave away bitcoins last year?
