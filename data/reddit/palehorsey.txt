this is a user problem. and they learnt a lesson. its still the wild west out there on the internet for those that dont know.  no matter what software, check and recheck what is the actuall official site. pet peave.... pupular apps/services with subreddits and side bar does not have the official home of the project! 
and do check integrity of the file by checking hashes/pgp

well i had to google what the hell it was so maybe thats a reason.   if its not easy to reverse transactions, bring it up on the bitsquare forum. there is a thread about payment methods.

You don't need an app to transaction cash for Bitcoin in person. Maybe find a forum for hookups? If you mean physical cash deposit to a  bank branch , I think this is the most common lbc method? that is now supported. The app is still fairly new and a few quirks bugs will exist.  If something not working right ask on forum or the subreddit

have a read of this part of the faq.
its in multisig, 2 of 3, so the bitcoin wont move, but you will need to prove to the arbitrator (bitsquare head guru only for now) that you have sent the funds. pagesigner/tlsnotary sounds solid, but never used it. apparently some institutions offer digitally signed transactions you can possibly send as proof too. or you can videotape the teller you have sent x to y, or give the head guru your login to your bank account. he is trustworthy i hear. :0
