Hi there, I've created a wallet bought $20 but sold it out of idiocy. 
@_date: 2014-12-01 19:33:46
I do intend to convert it to USD immediately.  I was hoping that Bitcoin would be a great test case in this situation .  I'll hold off on making the transition further.  Thanks guys

Thank you, this makes mucho more sense. Should be a wiki.

Can someone explain creating paper wallets in the simplest terms? 
@_date: 2014-05-24 02:03:25
Yes yes, I meant XBT. Thank you.

Excuse my ignorance but this seems great for my family back in Dominican Republic. My question is how do they cash out the Bitcoin I've just sent them? Nobody accepts btc in DR(that I know of), and really what they need is cash. Thanks in advance for the help.

Thank you kindly ! I will pay it forward very soon.

I just downloaded the block chain wallet on android. No btc yet. Should I not use the service? 
@_date: 2015-01-10 02:25:37
Haha no, I downloaded the app, no btc bought. Now I'm using a different one recommended by Bitcoin.org

Thank you, I've decided on a different wallet. I'm going to use some in paper storage once I have enough btc that it would hurt.

That's why I just invested $4.50. Although I'm a bit hungry now :'-(
