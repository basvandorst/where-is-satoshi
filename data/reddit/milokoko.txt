You assume that present price of BTC has an explanation in its fundamentals. It doesn't. 10 000 USD for BTC is speculation about how much it can be worth in the future. 
The non-speculative price of BTC is around 3000 USD. If the promises about f.ex. LN will not deliver, then the price will slowly go down to such levels.

Greetings from Cracow!
Nothing to see here, just another shitty business wanting to be intermediary for sth You should do on Your own - buying and selling Bitcoin. Plus, as someone pointed it out already - they charge huge fees.
Don't give them any recognition - we DON'T want this kind of people in Bitcoin community.
Tacy kurwa Janusze biznesu:)

Don't get cocky. Nothing lasts forever. BTC will not just grow automatically every year. If the adoption will not grow, then the price will stop growing and then collapse, as people who have hoped for &gt; 10000% gain will resign and cash out.
Ps. IMHO everything depends on LN. If it's a success then moon. If it's meh or adoption will take too slow, then...."I told you it was a bubble" guy will finally win.

Deflationary nature alone will not keep the price to rise (at least not as much as most of the investors expect) hence without much more adoption the price will collapse.

Good. That's actually exactly what we need from the economic perspective. First, create technology that everyone can connect to as a 2nd layer and benefit. Don't worry about bans. If big banks will oppose, small banks will use it and win. If big countries will oppose, smart countries (Japan) will use it. If greedy companies will abuse it (Coinbase), shortly we will have community -
 friendly alternatives (Robinhood). Focus on technology, LN in particular this year, and someone will have an incentive  to use it.

Let's not make this the focus ;) It doesn't matter where I'm from. I'm sure not only Polish government spends money to spread negative emotions towards Bitcoin. You can even assume that almost all articles from big newspapers in every country were bought specifically to discredit crypto. 
ps. I wouldn't be surprised if Mike Hearn or Roger Vermin also received some compensation for doing their part in dividing the community and spreading negative rumours. I wonder which person from the community will be bought next to claim publically that Bitcoin is finished. Or, which country will be next to 'ban' BTC and later dany this just after the dip ;)

They are more important for the price, short-term. If fundamentals are there, mid to long-term psychology doesn't matter and liquidity will come.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:15:27
The last sentence I agree. 
But I'm not looking at Reddit, news or other "sources of information". If BTC will drop more, then people will never use it hence any development in f.ex. LN or Rootstock will become useless. Unless You just want to exchange money with few geeks, local niche - for this You don't need any improvements - on-chaiN transactions, 0,0001mb block size limit would be enough.

I would like it to be otherwise, but BTC, and all other crypto for that matter are not usable as a currency.
Let's say You wanted to buy sth yesterday for 1000 USD. The shop was closed. You come back today, but the price after the dip for the same thing is 1100 USD. That's retarded :D

1. Most early adopters either lost their keys (they didn't predict BTC will be worth so much) or lost their stash because of MTGox.
2. 2nd generation of adopters (let's say since 2015) .... well I'm one of them. I didn't sell. Why? I don't know how much it will drop, I don't have a crystal ball. One thing I'm sure: 
A. If BTC will rise to the levels no one is dreaming now, I will never forgive myself selling that early. And You have to know - this is not a sell-off - it's a market manipulation of big fish trying to collect as many cheap coins as possible before mass adoption.
B. If it goes to zero.....i already cashed 4x my initial investment, so no trouble. Even if this experiment will fail - it was quite a ride anyway ;)
ps. I value my BTC at around 50 000 USD per coin. Nobody will get it cheaper, I would rather go down with it.

Actually, I remember reading it :) Though the guy is a bit delusional, nevertheless, I stayed invested in BTC. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:40:35
I knew this will happen, I got an email from the Nigerian Prince with an insider info. Also, he wants me to buy BTrash.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:06:18
Too little, too late.
Fuck Coinabse. For delaying SW. For supporting Roger Vermin BTrash coin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:12:50
Missing the word 'only' before '32.7%'. 
This is very low. Due to the popularity of smart-contract platform that is used nowhere at this moment, SCAM bank's token and Roger Verming BTrash coin. This is a disgrace that such pathetic projects are eating BTC's lunch.
@_date: 2018-02-17 10:42:01
What DID You expect from Visa? I'm honestly fucking surprised that They corrected themselves that quickly.

This situation and their level of 'customer service' is not a surprise to me.
I bought latest Ledger wallet in October. I had a problem with installing wallet software from their application. The issue has been known for a while now, many people face it, but they don't intend to resolve it - they usually answer - 'It's a problem with Your computer'. Tried to contact them, but they said the same thing - reinstall and install OS. Meh. 
I put Ledger somewhere deep in the drawer and never intend to use it again.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:56:11
One can only hope, that weak hands lost so much money this time, that at least most of them will never come back. Then we can finally grow slowly, but surely.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:31:46
Also, never diverse, take advice from YouTube experts and keep checking BTC price every 30 sec. Last but not least - always listen to FUD !
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:27:44
The most positive line for me - 'support for Schnorr signatures can be activated with a soft fork.' Good to know that we won't have to wait again for these fucking chinese miners to allow BTC to go forward.

There are hidden orders on f.ex. Bitfinex and it's been like this for a while now. Big fish want to take as many BTC from weak hands while the price is pathetically low. I think it's good. If You sell BTC now when it's being criticized left and right, You don't deserve to benefit when it will grow.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:26:49

For me, it is a safe heaven. Has been for sweet 4 years now. Has been and will remain to be. Safe heaven from banks, from my government, from anyone who, for some reason, would like to know how much money I have and what I do with it. BTC works for me as a safe heaven whether some fucking obsolete Dow Jones is plummeting or not.
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:14:54
After SW adoption by Coinbase* and growing LN hopefully by the end of the year BTC can again be considered fastest and cheapest way to send money.
*BTW: Fuck Coinbase. For delaying SW. For supporting Roger Vermin Coin

Having been here since 190 USD, I think that going below 8000 USD will make UNREPAIRABLE damage.

I'm after the phase of delusion, denial, fear, and depression - all happened one after another in January. Now I just don't give a shit anymore. I'm not selling at this price and any fucking speculator/ bank/ exchange or whoever the fuck is disgustingly manipulating the market at this moment - go eat dick because i will either sell my BTC for a reasonable price or will not sell it at all.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:02:08
Not enough. These are just technical mumbo-jumbo people don't understand and it's also sth that we will benefit from after maybe 2-3 years. By then, it can be all over.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:15:35
What a load of horse shit. They can't possibly be sure who has how many BTC. Someone might be in possession of 5 mln BTC and they wouldn't even know. And that's the whole point.

Warren Buffet was a great investor 20 - 30 years ago. This doesn't mean he is some kind of fucking alpha &amp; omega and knows everything about the future.

I am not buying, I am holding. But I will not lie to myself - during the crash people tend not to invest in risky things, and BTC is one of them. It may go a different way - people will see it as a safe heaven. No one can be sure.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:17:21
It's working. Already. Growing slowly but surely. Your asking who's working on this? Better do Your part - set up a node. Do some transactions with few sato. Tell Your friends that it's the shit.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:03:17
I'm not sure how it seems, but if You have BTC and use don't use it immediately, then You're invested in Bitcoin, whether You like it or not ;)

Any Wall Street involvment is not good. Just have a look at the charts of different commodities since the 70s and how they behaved before &amp; after they have been involved in futures or any other 'certified' investment products. 
You cannot fight with the present monetary system and at the same time hope for any kind of involvment from banks or government backed institutions. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:27:31

Message to people/ businesses/ developers involved long-term in bitcoin. Fu***ng do sth! Send some positive info. Anything. Now! Sth to elevate the morale. Otherwise, we'll have to wait for the next generation to gain some trust in Bitcoin. And by then, someone will invent sth better than BTC so by then You can put LN deep inside your ass because nobody will care.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:14:31
BTrash is such a disgrace, that it doesn't even deserve to suck someone's dick. Better change it to Dash logo. They suck as well, but at least they have some developers.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:10:26
On this event, the price of BTC can either plummet or shoot up. It's 50/50, no one can be sure which way it would go if someone says otherwise - he is delusional or just speculating.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:01:51

And if SW 20% adoption is the only positive thing people can write now on reddit, we are going down bigtime.

You can relax only when we reach 10 000 and stay above.

Yes. Since then, the so-called torrent market has shrunk exponentially.
Also, if f.ex. KickAssTorrents had any valuation back then, it would go to 0 in a matter of hours.
Not a perfect comparison, my friend. But hodl anyways.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:40:48
SW adoption is not going straight up. Today it's 20 % tomorrow it will be 13 %. Stop masturbating to these meaningless spikes, it's pathetic. 
You complain about FUD but some people stretch the line too much in the opposite direction. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:24:43
Whether You like it or not, most of the BTC investors are speculators, gamblers. Sad but they are the ones that got the price so high and they are the ones that can take it to the ground.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:46:56
Which is arguably even worse :D

It depends on how You define sustainable.
If 'sustainable' means more than 70 years than government-backed currency has been pretty fucking sustainable.
If sustainable means forever than nothing is. Nothing lasts forever.
