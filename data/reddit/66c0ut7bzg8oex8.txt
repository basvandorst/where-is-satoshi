Electrum developers sabotage segwit adoption. But you can make segwit-3x electrum wallet

Why someone use crypto-crypto (non fiat) exchange that require banksters AML shit?

they sabotage segwit adoption.


But majority of electrum users have to use non-segwit address "in order to be able to receive bitcoins during the transition period".


"Please use non-segwit address during the transition period! Keep tx fees at high level!"

You can generate new seed in electrum, save this seed, go back and restore wallet with this seed and right derivation path instead insecure generating seed on websites.

Good. If you don't like AML shit - don't trade on exchange that limit crypto-crypto trade and crypto withdrawal for unverified users. Don't provide liquidity to banksters bootlickers.

Brainwashing and mostly useless knowledge.

So you don't have something against they actually **rob you**, you only don't like how they spend money?

They can't sell mined fake bitcoin to full node users and have to pay electricity bills from their own pocket.
