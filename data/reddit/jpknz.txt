There some good information [here]( but doesn't seem to be anything age related.  There are tax free allowances as well for capital gains so it depends how much you sell (if you even have to pay being under 18).
It's all done by self assessment however so if you don't do a self assessment then it's unlikely they will know (not saying don't pay taxes - it's up to you if you want to declare it or not)

It's possible. There are no fees for maker trades on gdax.
When I looked at buying and selling in different currencies it meant for every £3000 I spent I was going to lose £50-80 by the time it got back in to my uk bank account. Will have another look now.
Edit : I'd make £21 if I spent £3000 however there is no way to get true gbp off Coinbase. I've heard some have managed to get uk accounts verified and withdraw to them (I haven't bothered - just work in Euros via Revolut which has no fees and a better exchange rate).  If I were to get verified for a uk account Coinbase exchanges it for euros when they send it and then my bank will exchange back to gbp. The rates of both of those exchanges will more than wipe out the £21 I made. It's also likely that my bank would charge a fee for incoming euros further wiping out any profit.

So effectively lighting becomes your wallet? I thought when channels were settled they were written back to the blockchain.
Are you effectively saying if I had 200 sats in my lightning wallet I can spend where and with whomever I like without tying up all 200 or even a portion of it in channels? So I want to spend 25 at the supermarket and 30 on my mobile phone bill I don't have to put 55 in to a channel first - I can just spend from the 200?

Driving the price up isn't going to help - no-one will want to spend if it keeps going up/is volatile (don't get me wrong - I don't mind).
They also need easy ways to integrate and price alongside regular fiat. I can't imagine a supermarket accepting it anytime soon with the price volatility.

Ok the way channels are explained in all of the alice pays bob and dave how it works explanations doesn't say that (at least that I've seen). Likely to be confusing for people when it says have to open a channel with bob first and lock up your 1 bitcoin with him until you're done paying your 25 sats.  
If it does work simply like an account that you can access anytime from any channel then thats good.

Sorry I might not have gone in to enough detail in previous answer.
Essentially there is high demand for Euro btc as the population is higher. That is why you see the high wall on the buy side.  There isn't enough people selling btc in Euros to at the moment to have a huge sell wall like the other markets.
With gbp and usd there is plenty of supply at the price of btc in those currencies to not only fill the orders being bought at that price but also to have a large surplus at that and subsequent higher prices.
If a seller had access to both markets and had surplus btc in usd or gbp they would be smart to change it the Euro market for the higher prices (if they did this enough it was naturally start to correct the price to be in line with other currencies).
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:40:13
So maybe I've missed something in how lightning works. Let's say I have all my money in my lightning wallet - I can simply request to pay the cost of my trip to the supermarket from that balance or do I have to transfer it in to a specific payment channel first?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:26:29
That's what I thought but wanted to check.
Europe has a population of 742m+ so it stands to reason that a percentage of them are on gdax. While it may be an American company the demand on the euro pairing is likely higher due to the population difference. 
The gbp pairing is largely pointless as Coinbase have stopped (sometime ago) transfers of British pounds. The only way to get new pounds in to the platform is to buy using credit or debit card on Coinbase with a 3.99% fee. 
It'll also be the reason that the price in Euros is higher (or has been - haven't checked recently) if you convert the euro value of a coin to the US value.

No issues with the SEPA transfer but they put my funds on hold immediately (and didn't tell me they had done it).  When I realised I emailed them asking why and showing that I didn't met any of the criteria for putting funds on hold that is listed on their website.
They released the funds pretty quickly but they shouldn't have been locked up in the first place.  The reason they gave me was the the reference number was too short.....that's bollacks in my mind as the last part of the reference number is always kraken.com and the funds hit my account before they put them on hold so they knew they were for me.  Also I checked the reference where I sent it from and it wasn't short at all.

Withdrawals to U.K. bank accounts aren't available from Coinbase/gdax. Has to be via a Euro account. I use Revolut which gives you a Euro account and a uk sort code and account number.
Send from your uk bank to your Revolut sort code and account number
Exchange gbp for Eur on Revolut (it's fee free and you get the interbank fx rate which is much better than any uk bank)
Send euro to Coinbase (make sure you out the reference number)
Once your Revolut account has shown up in your Coinbase account your can simply do the above in reverse to get the money to your normal uk bank.
If you are holding gbp on Coinbase/gdax then you will need to change this to Euros before you send it. The best way to do this is
Login to gdax (its your Coinbase login)
Deposit the gbp in to gdax from your Coinbase wallet
Buy btc/ltc/eth (whichever you prefer). If you are a maker then there is no fees
Sell btc/ltc/eth for euros (in gdax you can change which market you're in at the top left of the screen). Again no fees if maker trade
Withdraw euros from gdax to your Revolut. This will cost €0.15c which is the same as the Coinbase euro withdrawal fee.

Understand that. Wouldn't a hub have to have a lot of currency tied up in ⚡️in order to be useful however?
Eg if a supermarket (Tesco/Walmart/Coles/pak'n'save - doesn't matter which one just a large national one) has 1 million transactions in a day each worth an average of say 25 satoshis then the hub has to put up 0.25 btc.  Now 0.25btc doesn't sound like much because of the current fiat value of a btc (€14.5k, US$17.2k, £12.9k) but consider that fiat doesn't exist anymore (the great worldwide fiat/cryptowars of 2021 took care of it) and a satoshi is like £1/€1/$1 today. Do the calculations. 25 x 1 million is 25 million. No one is going to put up 25 million of their own money to facilitate transactions for a supermarket. If they do then they are getting something out of it - e.g. They are a business that is essentially centralising money flows again.

I have both a trezor and ledger nano s. Personally I prefer the trezor in terms of ease of use/UI etc. The nano s looks better when folded away but comes with a stupidly long cheap cable which I find annoying (trezor comes with a short/just fright length cable). The buttons on the nano feel cheap also. The software inside it is actually pretty good though - still user friendly.
That just my personal opinion to be honest but at the end of the day they both do what it says on the tin so to speak.

.....is what.....???
And what is the estimated annual electricity consumption of fiat with the paper manufacturing (including growing trees, cutting them etc), printing, transport, physical buildings (of banks and manufacturing plants), destruction facilities plus all the secondary support functions for those services - security (buildings/personal/transport), cleaning, data centres, etc etc....
@_date: 2018-05-06 00:09:28
Reducing electricity consumption is not vital to fighting off extinction - ensuring capacity is a art of ensuring this for sure. By ensuring capacity you sure up a way of life - hospitals, warmth etc.  Changing how that capacity is generated from fossil to green/renewables is key and is starting to or is happening the world over. Even in the US where the current president seems hell bent on fossil fuels (for whatever reason - not a topic for here) green energy is happening and it’s winning. 
Extinction aside for a minute (as that’s as bad as some the babies are dying calls that ‘jesus’ preaches these days - bitcoin is not the major user of electricity nor will it be in the future. The basis of bitcoins so called electricity consumption is flawed (see links below). 
Even if this wasn’t the case look at fiat and what energy it takes to produce from growing the tree/extracting the oil (for plastic used in notes)/raising and killing cattle (tallow used in notes)/mining the metals (for coins) etc etc, manufacturing the notes/coins, transporting them, security, banks building electricity consumption, bank employees energy use to get to work each day etc etc....the list goes on - the energy consumption is enormous!

Go to your account on Kraken (not CryptoWatch or trade.kraken) and click on orders. Here you will find all of your orders.
You will see these ‘disappearing’ orders here listed as cancelled and if you click on one of the orders you the reason will be insufficient margin. This simple means that there wasn’t enough available margin in the pool to fulfil your order st that point in time.  [

I get what you're saying - I think the words insecure chip are misleading though. I understand what is called secure element on the ledger and what it does however that doesn't automatically mean that something using a product that doesn't have the word secure in it is insecure.
If you really wanted to get it to it then this more comes down to whether or not you believe open source and therefore auditable (is that a word??) is better or worse than closed source and therefore placing trust in a 3rd party (the secure element makers) not to build back doors etc. A lot of users probably don't care or perhaps understand either way.
I'm personally don't have strong opinions either way. I have a trezor but I didn't verify the source code of the firmware before using it (probably like a lot of people). I am going to get a ledger in the near future however.
Whichever you choose or have they are both only as secure as the paper that you've written your seed and PIN on anyway (or however you choose to store these)!
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:28:37
The latest firmware (which you have to install upon purchase as it doesn't come with any firmware) already addressed this attack vector.  [ 
If you didn't have the latest firmware (why wouldn't you update to the latest) then someone would physically need access to your trezor, would have to disasemble it and have special firmware.

It's not to do with the chips per se as trezor have already patched this attack vector without changing out the chips.

It has nothing to do with the value hitting 10K USD.  The IRS started this over a year ago and wanted everyones data. Coinbase ignored them and has subsquently fought them with the latest outcome reducing the request by 97% of customers.  Coinbase has not said they are going to give the IRS this information either.  While their statement doesn't outright say that they are going to continue fighting for those 14K customers it does imply it.

Transfer money from your bank and have it ready in your Coinbase first wallet to buy when dips occur.
Better yet if it's available where you are use gdax - do the same thing having money available in your gdax fiat wallet ready to buy. Gdax is your Coinbase login but with maker trades is fee free.

I don't think Coinbase/gdax allow you to have access to the usd market and another market (say Eur or gbp) at the same time.
Other exchanges do however - bitstamp and kraken for instance.
Or just use Revolut. You'll get the interbank fx rate and no fees to send a transfer internationally .

Gdax is the trading exchange of Coinbase. Once you have a Coinbase login you use it to login to gdax (provided you're in a location that gdax is allowed).  You can avoid all fees by placing limit (or market maker) orders rather than market taker orders.
Coinbase is just a front end made for ease of use for the average joe and accepts credit and debit cards. For this there are fees applied by Coinbase (and more recently likely your card provider as well if it's a credit card). Underneath the front end Coinbase purchases and sales use gdax to actually fulfil the customer request.

Not sure if it would work in the USA but I do the following from the U.K. to get to the Coinbase platform (which is in euros) to avoid poor exchange rates and fees
Send from my UK bank account to Revolut in GBP (no fees)
Exchange on Revolut from GBP to EUR at the interbank rate (no fx fees at all)
Send Euros from Revolut to Coinbase's account in Estonia (no fees to do this)
It's a lot quicker as well - about 4-6 hours total time instead of up to several days.
The key is simply finding a platform that allows you to send to Coinbase - in this case Revolut. Just check the platform you use allows sending to crypto exchanges (by entering the exchange bank details in to the platform) before sending anything from your bank account to it.

You will find those types of reviews for all exchanges. It's a very rare occurrence that someone writes a review to say something like it all worked as expected which is why you only see negative reviews.
Kraken and bitstamp are what I use sing with gdax (Coinbase's exchange).  Gdax is fee free for maker trades and you'll only pay 0.15€cents for SEPA withdrawals. 
While there are gbp markets they aren't as liquid as the euro ones so I find it better to use euros. Nb you won't be able to withdraw gbp from Coinbase/gdax (and probably others as well) which is another reason to use euros.
As the other poster said get Revolut. You'll get the interbank fx rate (your high street bank won't give you this) and it's fee free (most U.K. banks charge a fee for international or SEPA transfers). With Revolut you can load in gbp, convert to Eur (without fees and at interbank fx rate) and send to all the exchanges above without fees.

While it sucks that you lost your bitcoins it is 100% your responsibility. You are your own bank and responsible for how and where you store them and also the security that comes with you chosen storage as well as the security of where you store keys/passwords and how you access them (clean devices etc). 
If someone got your internet banking password and transferred money out of your bank account your bank would possibly refund the money (provided they can’t semi prove that you simply gave your password to someone else). With bitcoin that doesn’t happen because you and you alone are the responsible party and there are no refunds/chargebacks etc that banks provide (and charge fees to customers for the service).

Don’t think they should be doing this tbh for reasons others have listed. 
That said maybe they’ve learned from the debacle of adding bcash that some forks are just rubbish and as much as people want them they need to allow a way to let those people move them off the platform (even though they don’t belong to the individual) and not add them for trading.
On the other hand - good move for users who just want to cash out every fork. Seems to be a move to make Coinbase even more usable by newcomers.
