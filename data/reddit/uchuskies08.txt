Never got the impression from anyone that we "needed" it.  I think some people were salivating at selling some of their coins for $3-4K this year, but I saw a lot of hesitation about what an ETF would mean for bitcoin long-term.

So, I'll be the one to ask -
Why or how are you locked out?  Did you forget your password?  Login one day and your account is locked down?

So this would not include a wallet like GreenAddress? Because they do multisig keys?
