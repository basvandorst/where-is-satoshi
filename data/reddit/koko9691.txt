Hey everyone! So me and my friend recently started making cryptocurrency themed pop sockets. If you don't know what pop sockets are, they're grips for your phones that also work as a stand for your device. We have four designs right now; Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and HODL and we're also making the remaining top 20 (marketcap) coins as pop sockets as well with color.
Let me know if you guys have any suggestions on new designs everyone might like!!
