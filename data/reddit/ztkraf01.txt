Yeah I’ll do this. I use slushpool. In your mind what is considered the line between a normal size transaction and a micro transaction? Right now my payout threshold is .002 BTC and it occurs about every day. I know this may be relative but I would think ledger would have guidelines for a minimum input value, say.

Look it's obvious you're not going to be persuaded here. I'm sorry that you're so blinded by your traditional ways and conservative thinking. Don't get me wrong I'm a conservative myself but there's a difference between being a dumb republican and someone who can think for themselves.  I've met people like you all throughout life and the outcome has always been the same. The last ones to be forced into a new "thing". Never able to think for themselves or be proactive. Just following the rules because that's what they think is right. That's all fine and dandy but try not to think your way is the only way next time something new comes into your life.

The dollar has nothing tangible backing it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:06:57
All things considering, nothing on the planet is "worth" anything. Things can be useful to certain people and therefore it has value but we are talking more about the true definition of value. What is your definition of value? To me value is only given to something based on desire by a person or group of people. The reason for that desire doesn't matter.
Our paper dollar only has value because our government says they will accept it as payment for taxes. It's been driven into our brains for 200 years that it has value. Who's to say in 200 years we will think the same about cryptocurrency (maybe not bitcoin but something similar)?

It's all a risk ha I agree. Investing that same amount into BTC directly could end up a huge loss as well. But I'm a believer in this cause!
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:36:56
You don’t pay taxes until you exchange into fiat. Just as you wouldn’t pay taxes on 100 shares of AAPL that you held over the past 3 years and haven’t sold yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:20:16
The way I think of it is our paper money is backed by gold and other physical items that have value. Why do they have value? Because they're rare and the general public has a desire for these items. The gov keeps the gold in a giant warehouse in Fort Knox, KY. The gov wants you to trust them which is laughable in my opinion.
BTC is non-physical gold. Just another "thing" that you can "print money" to represent. So owning some BTC is like owning a few ounces of gold or silver. It's rare. There's a finite amount. It's desirable by the public. It's valuable. This year for BTC is the California Gold Rush for gold. Now is the time to get yourself some digi-gold. And hodl

I think the overall sentiment that someone has had success with the currency is just good. It makes people want to find out what this cryptocurrency is and how they can make a quick buck.
That in itself is not good but some of those people that  join in for profit find out that this is much bigger than short term profit. They hop on the hodl train and tell all their friends about the future of currency. So success stories of people selling their BTC is not a bad thing. It's like advertising. Just gets people's feet in the door.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:59:55
Maybe I don’t understand what you mean but in both situations you wouldn’t pay taxes until you exchange the alt coins OR the BTC for USD. Even if you exchange altcoins for BTC it’s still an unrealized gain in the eyes of the fed since it’s not USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:12:33
I’m not in any way a left leaning person like it sounds like you are. And I don’t want to be a tax free state. I believe there are few things the Federal gov should provide us the most important being a strong military. All I am saying is there is an unreasonable amount of waste in government across the board and no one wants to address it because all they have to do is just take more from us and it will be fine. How can you stand by and at least not think we can do better than our current system? Ever heard of continuous improvement? You’re sounding like one of those “we’ve always done it that way so it’s right” type of people.

You’re late to the party buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:12:42
Sure but in 50 years how do you know what people will use? The way you think is VERY similar to what people thought about the internet in the early 90's. Why not give something new a shot? Why not try to make things better instead of refusing change and being stuck in a broken system? I'm not saying BTC is a good system. Right now it is not. But nothing is perfect at first. It takes time and improvements. Don't be so closed minded. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:13:49
Please explain why 30% of the money I work hard for must be taken from my paycheck every month. And if I work even harder to make more money then not only do I pay a higher dollar mount (30%), I graduate to a higher tax bracket. Exponentially take more of my hard earned money for the same bullshit. You wouldn’t purchase a mediocre product at a premium price would you? So don’t say there aren’t major problems with government and the tax system in general 
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:43:22
No but why does it have to be one or the other? Why can't both exist and be valuable? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:39
Exactly. A happy medium that could really take off in price. This investment is strictly for making money though. It's obviously opposite of the reason for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:50:34
My power is 9 cents per kWh in the Midwest so not too bad. I’ve never heard of antminer using their own equipment and then shipping used equipment advertised as new to the consumer. Seems illegal. 
Investing instead of mining goes back to the whole reason I love btc. I would rather take part in the machine that keeps BTC moving. We need as much mining power as possible to keep up with transactions. People aren’t going to hop on board the BTC train if it takes hours to process their transactions. So I feel better about mining and getting returns this way than simply giving coinbase 4% of my money to just trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:01:19
Right but rarity certainly plays a role in value. The other part of it is desire.

What you're describing is exactly what anti-bitcoiners do.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:27:52
I agree with you. I’m not one of those radical bitcoiners but I do think the concept is important. I don’t think bitcoin can overthrow the US dollar and I’m not sure I want it to. But I think crypto can play a very important role in the world economy. It just amazes me how many people discount it immediately because they don’t understand it. Like everyone has their heads in the sand and are incapable of learning or trying something new. 
I know people that were very happy when it corrected yesterday. Why does that make someone happy? I’ll never understand that human trait. “I’m happy that you’re losing money even though it doesn’t affect me in any way.” Anyway I’m with you on the US dollar. Just don’t discount a new technology because you never know what it could be used for down the road.

“Too big to fail”
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:15:54
Exactly what I did but bought an S4 and split the cost with a couple people. After getting my feet wet I purchased S7 and S9
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:49
I may speculate that that’s what we are seeing right now. Too many people in it for the quick buck.  Short term we will see correction not only in price but in marketing. But in my opinion bad press is good press. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:03:31
Dude stop giving us reasonable republicans a bad name. Log off please 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:15:24
I monitor the value of btc to ensure I’m still profiting. I find more value in possessing BTC even if I’m not able to make the $300 to pay off the machine. Hence why I’ve already upgraded to the S7 and S9. The S4 was meant as a cheap way to get my feet wet in mining. 
Another thing is I don’t believe value of btc will go down enough to lose money. I’m on pace to make $140 this month with the S4. Power will cost about $60. So I’m still profiting $80. As with anything in life, you gotta spend money to make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:29:02
The US dollar! What you wrote paragraphs on. You say it’s backed by the “most powerful military” etc. what you’re saying is the US dollar is how we’ve always done it and it’s too big to fail. No use in trying something new and potentially better. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:34:05
Really? Wow I did not know this. Why does the government keep gold locked away then? Just to say they have some assets worth something? 
This makes me even more anti-government. It's amazing to see how big of a hole we've dug ourselves into when you look at the Fed and our money management. Reminds me of the demotivational poster in my office that says:
None of us is as dumb as all of us!
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:41:19
That’s literally what I said so I don’t know what your point is. “Desirable by the public.” Rarity is relative. Gold is certainly rare. Never said it’s value stems only from its rarity. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:29:35
Ah I see that actually makes a lot of sense regarding antminer. Nothing us normies can really do about that though unless you work for a miner manufacturer. 
Either way when I have 2 S9’s and 2 S7’s running I’ll be bringing in about $1800/month at current valuation. 3 months and my initial investment is covered. I could sink that $5400 into BTC directly but if value is stagnant for 3 months I’ve got nothing to show for it. Know what I mean? Not to mention resell value of miners is fantastic. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:01:21
Investing is not a form of gambling. Investing in crypto is certainly gambling but investing in index funds is a very responsible thing to do. I highly suggest young people learn how to invest as early as possible. The money they invest at those ages will be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars when they retire.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:34:04
This isn’t true at all. My S4 is still profitable. My Two S7’s and two S9’s on order are both even more profitable. Anyone with some startup capital like a few hundred dollars can get the S4, run it 24/7 and still make a few BTC even after electricity 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:19:26
They tell you the fee before you click ok so that's all on you. 
Also those fees do not go to Coinbase they go to the miners and BTC network.

His point is there is an overwhelming amount of tax dollars wasted for crap like Betty the front office lady’s 6 weeks of vacation she gets every year. Or keeping Richard around to staple reports together 365 days a year instead of an automatic stapler. The amount of waste in government is astounding. If it were a business it wouldn’t last a month. Pay for the things we need with our taxes. Nothing more and nothing less. 
I also wish there was a fix to the problem that companies are not competitive when it comes to government contracts. Everyone knows you can charge the gov 50% higher prices than a private company and they will sign the dotted line.

That’s what I’m fucking saying dude. Step out of your internet safety box for a second and think about what I said. Yeah maybe crypto is slightly teetered on the speculator investor side for now but over time I believe it will come to a “new” natural crypto balance that proves it useful in daily life. It should absolutely be taxed if using it to purchase another asset and then selling said asset for a profit or loss. Same as anything else. This is not a complicated subject. It should be treated as anything you use to trade whether it’s ISD or a fucking pelt

See this is what I really dislike about this. In my personal, logical, simple opinion we should not be paying taxes on money we made from something the government had no part in. Our local, state, and federal government had no part in making or maintaining BTC.
The money we use to buy BTC has already been taxed via income tax. Only difference is that income tax came from money made on local, state, and federal property sold to a business. We pay too many taxes for not that much in return is all I'm saying. F*ck the IRS. (Although I'll still give them money if they ask for it.)

The key to trading anything is to not be reactive. If you're buying in because you truly believe in the cause or company, then hodl at all times even on 30% corrections. If you're buying in just for some profit, sell at 11k. Stop being greedy expecting it to go higher. Take your profits and wait for another good entry point even if you only made a few bucks.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:51:01
Sure. Bottom line is your average home-miner is a hobbyist so we are willing to spend money on the front end in hopes of making money down the road. It's just a fun thing for some of us. I also see mining as an easy way to dollar cost average. 
For me, GPU mining is just a fun hobby as long as I'm not losing my butt

What's your definition of "win" though? I like BTC as much as the next person but I think it has it's own use. It's awful for moving money unless you're moving thousands. Right now it's taking hours to get 6 confirmations. And that's with only 4-7 transactions per second.
