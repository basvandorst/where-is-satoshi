what? Which transactions will be moved from the main chain to the lightning network?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:48:29
Wow this just makes bitcoin holders look childish and weak
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:44:38
This idea that if you have a single bug in your code you are a trash developer, or even a worse developer than someone with bug free code, that has come to this space is absolutely ridiculous and can only be propagated by people that have never developed. Bugs happen get over it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:03:39
But BU has enough support that Segwit is likely never going to happen right? So are we just going to stay gridlocked or is someone going to hardfork without enough hashrate?
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:40:31


Let's definitely talk down to everyone that disagrees with us...
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:50:23
It was never really tested before because the community was never so divided. Arguments can be made for both the nodes and miners having power. Really they are interdependant
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:56:57
Why dont we get a few people to invest in mining rigs in the US?
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:02:38
I'm pretty sure btc-e is run by the russian mob yet I trust them with thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin. I trust btc-e way more than i trust the brokers making trades for me on the various stock markets
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:51:28
The analogy seems to be advocating trust in a small group of authority figures though i.e. the pilots. Isn't that antithetical to bitcoin's values?
@_date: 2017-03-30 18:56:03
It seems like neither segwit or BU will get enough to properly initiate a HF. So where do we go from here?
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:17:14
Shouldn't people be saving exploits in the BU codebase for the event of a hardfork instead of taking nodes down now?
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:58:53
Maybe i misread it but it didn't sound like the poster was taking a side. I'm new to bitcoin but it seems really clear to me that this isn't a technical argument so much as a political one
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:30:17
how does that work? Password manager i presume. Do you take it with you on a usb incase you ever need to login somewhere else?
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:23:57
Is crypto really that complex? I think we should try to portray it as something that is easy to get into
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:39:00
I feel like this isnt a hard problem to solve. Send your btc to a secondary address you control. Wait for a few confirmations and send your bcc from the first wallet to a third wallet. Wait a few confirmations and boom your coin are decoupled and replay attacks impossible
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:04:17
There is no economic incentive to do that though so i think any agreement would breakdown. you would have to do it by adding weight to those transactions, i.e. they take up 10% more room in a block
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:30:08
They upgraded their charts like 3 months ago and shit was pretty legit

Imho he is either dead or lost all of his keys
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:27:12
Maybe this is a stupid suggestion but if scaling is limited by 8 years of transactions when bitcoin had less adoption couldnt we do something like rebase the chain on like a new "genesis" block. We could pick a block lets say 10,000 confirmations in the past, squash the history and fork onto it. Anyone that wants to archive the original history of the chain is free to do so and we lighten up everyone's nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:34:59
The fact that there was no "inherent value" to bitcoin always sketched me out but then I realized that there is. The inherent value of bitcoin comes from the ecosystem. As long as the ecosystem is healthy and robust people will want to take part and buy btc. Sure the ecosystem could collapse causing a collapse in bitcoin but financial system could collapse. The ecosystem needs to have inertia
@_date: 2017-08-08 13:01:49
Maybe it would be worth doing an actual fork to solve that problem.

@_date: 2017-11-12 06:10:16
Excuse me for being blunt but if you were stupid enough to have your coin on an exchange during a fork, maybe you should sit out technical debates.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:26:32
Kevin pham sounds like a huge douche
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:59:16
no, unless you have immediate plans to move your bitcoins they should ALWAYS be in a wallet you control. If you don't own control the private keys you don't own the bitcoin. It is *especially* risky to have your coin on an exchange during a fork because the exchange may choose to support only one half of the fork and they may choose the wrong half. Exchanges have no obligation to give you coin from both sides of the fork
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:42:36
Would you guys be ammenable to having the same compromise that LTC has on btc? Why not push for the exact same agreement?
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:10:26
this is such a weird post...
@_date: 2017-04-10 01:38:17
Probably a stupid question but what are the implications of a simple bump to 2mb block size? How does that make btc less secure?
@_date: 2017-04-05 14:45:21
Serious question is bitcoin not secure at this moment? If we hypothetically just did a simple blocksize bump to 2mb how would that make btc less secure?
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:14:36
great I'll have like 4-5 coins around fork time. I'll pm you or you can pm me when it is closer and we can set something up

What can I run in order to run a segwit2x node?
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:53:48


what the fuck does that even mean? that is literally impossible. If you dont like their software you can write your own. you have no idea what you are talking about. Writing software does not give you control over bitcoin in any manner whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:56:04


  
This is pretty retarded fud. Bitcoin literally doesnt work that way
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:26:46
If the fork has 80+% of the hash power is it considered contentious?
@_date: 2017-09-30 21:30:54

Bitcoin has inherently increased in value which is where your new found wealth has come from, but deflation of the primary currency in the economy is still a very bad thing. A few sources that can probably explain it better than i can:

It was very interesting to read about mike hearn. I looked him up and it seems like it was a loss for bitcoin when he left.

@_date: 2017-10-16 04:53:49
Nah dude that's not how it works. Not in an open source project like bitcoin. They dont own it. It's not theirs. They aren't the fucking 'cypher punk rebellion' sticking it to the man, they aren't the only competent developers to exist in this world. they are egomaniacs incapable of compromising. A 1mb block size increase has to be the most insignificant change to the protocol I can imagine and they want to die on that hill? get over your bullshit idealizations and grow the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:02:31
Isnt that how open source is supposed to work?
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:50:05


  
You can make bitcoin inflationary without allowing it to be inflated at will. As Long as bitcoin follows explicit rules and those rules are hard to change people will trust it. 
  
And deflation absolutely depresses economic growth
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:11:55
What you guys seem to be missing is that this is an open source project, no one is firing annyone or has the ability to fire anyone, they can continue to work on bitcoin all they want. No one put anyone in charge of anything. It literally doesnt work like that.
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:09:37


Something doesnt have to be a big change to be a significant one.   
  


  
'just go to bch' is such a retarded argument. We all have stake in bitcoin and want bitcoin to grow. Instead of looking to fracture the community anytime someone disagrees with you, try looking for ways to compromise.
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:26:52


eh is it? It incentivizes people ot hold rather than spend which imho is slowing adoption

Or maybe core could stop being such prima donnas. It sounds like they are holding you hostage to their worldview
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:18:04
yeah plenty of users want 2x, no one is hijacking anything, the fork will happen via hashing power as bitcoin was designed to be updated. Saying this will bring about 'full kyc', blacklists and whitelists shows you have no idea what you are talking about or that you are being intentionally dishonest. The protocol is just as resistant to those things as before. So yeah your post is full of wut.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:00:50
I never understood the idea of a private blockchain? Like who is mining it? Might as well just have a distributed database then if you still have to trust everyone
@_date: 2017-10-16 05:03:29
I fucking cringe everytime I hear this 'core are all geniuses and only they are capable of working on bitcoin' crap. I immediately know anyone that spouts it off has no idea what they are talking about. The idea of having code that is difficult to work on or is in anyway exclusive to some small group of developers is anathema in the industry.  
  
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:17:26

@_date: 2017-07-31 22:02:29
Today BTC is worth BTC's value + BCC's value. Tomorrow post fork BTC is just worth BTC's value. Expect a drop about equivalent to what people think BCC will be worth

Right there with you man. Feel pretty helpless right now and I only had 20k there. Can't imagine losing even more than that
@_date: 2017-07-11 17:17:12
except the vast majority of users and businesses dont care about the segwit only crusade and will just go the path of least resistance which is with the miners
@_date: 2017-07-03 15:30:33
I assume there are apps that can utilize that? Are there any good ones that are secure?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:13:22
you can but it costs a fee to short and that fee is sky high right now which is exactly what i would expect. the fee should be roughly the cost of bcc

Sure I would agree that this should be an engineering driven decision but he is not saying changing the block size constitutes "redesigning" bitcoin. If the blocksize controls the reactor 'temperature' then there is no reason we cant increase it as the node storage tech gets better.
@_date: 2017-07-11 15:21:23
As long as there is over 80% mining support you probably wont even notice the change. The 20% chain will be orphaned pretty quickly
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:23:11
well you're just wrong or maybe misunderstanding me. Today the value of bitcoin is the value of bitcoin as if the fork never existed plus the value of bcc whatever the market decides that is. a bitcoin today is not just a bitcoin but a bitcoin plus a future bitcoin cash coin
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:14:18
After the fork Btc will drop the value of Bcc. buy it then
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:08:51
The biggest barrier to actual currency adoption is volatility. A volatile currency wrecks havoc on an economy
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:31:18
lol you are living in a fantasy land if you think locking in a BIP and not going through with half of it wouldn't be an absolute train wreck. Either implement what you said or don't signal it.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:09:33
Oh yeah it totally doesnt sounds like you guys are trying to destroy btc
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:12:24
Yeah I think not hf would probably have more downside at this point given the industry support for the NYA
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:00:16
I'm not sure I understand. How does malleable transactions make bitcoin less private?
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:01:23
He is not wrong about the short term. You should think of bitcoin cash as like a dividend. Once the dividend pays out the stock drops the price of the dividend. Today bitcoin is worth bitcoin's value + BCC's value. Tomorrow bitcoin is just worth bitcoin's value.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:20:18
that's not true at all. As long as people are able to buy btc on an exchange to secure the bcc the bitcoin will be worth btc+bcc. If what you are saying is true and the btc is trading below btc+bcc combined value then why wouldnt i just buy as much btc as I could and secure the bcc for an easy arbitrage?
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:47:50
I have no problem verifying myself to get my coins back personally. wouldn't mind that being the case
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:31:30
A lot of FUD everywhere UASF people are just as bad as BCC people. If miners lock in segwit2x and then refuse to  hf it would be pretty disastrous for btc
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:53:00
Is there proof of this? do you have transactions to point to?
@_date: 2017-07-26 05:25:52
nah i'd rather just leave btc. Why be in an asset so easily sabotaged by a few people that wont compromise? I'm sure you won't miss me but I am also sure that I won't be the only one to leave.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:45:43
So what your saying is that we can safely increase the block size as long as it doesn't outpace the storage capacity of nodes?
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:14:48
how much support does uasf even have?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:32:04
There is a massive bubble happening right now...
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:53:17
Im sure I can find a few on github. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 15:41:54
So you think we are not going to hardfork as part of Segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:40:01
what did the devs say? Probably that they would never do 2mb blocks? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:33:07
your statement makes btc sound like a ponzi scheme. I have the feeling this guy isnt buying btc becasue of fomo but because there is a massive bubble in stock market right now
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:39:55
lmao when? When is the scaling debate going to be resolved? There is no end in sight as far as i can see...
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:57:02
sure source on the primalbase scam and vitalik's role in that? Source on the howey test thing? why cant turing completeness and rich statefulness both be valuable? wtf are you talking about in point 4? Eth is only unfinished in the sense that bitcoin is unfinished. it is a tech that will grow and evolve with it's users need so 5 is just bs.  
  
You sound like you vaguely heard someone else's anti-eth propaganda and are just regurgitating it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:42:46
ouch, sound like leos are monitoring who tries to use the site?
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:47:27
Oh wow that was hard to read. I shouldnt have to read 25% of the article just to find the point
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:37:14
It means we softfork segwit then a few months later we hard fork to 2mb blocks
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:43:16
if you spend any amount of time on the two btc subs they are nowhere near getting their acts together
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:32:06
Was really expecting more movement over the scaling news...
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:19:05
They cant delay. They have a built in timebomb that strongly incentivizes the switch by increasing mining difficulty
@_date: 2017-06-13 14:35:29
3 confirmations doesnt mean much when you have 15 second blocks. You are probably going to want something like 10 confirmations to avoid scams
@_date: 2017-06-19 14:46:20
Why did the devs go the route of weighting transactions differently instead of just keeping block size based on the transaction data? It seems like an unnecessary complication...
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:43:49
80%+ of miners are signaling for it. I'm pretty sure if they reneg after segwit but before the hf btc will plummet. who would want to be in an asset so easily dictated by egos? I know i would personally pull out completely and immediately. I really have a hard time seeing people pulling that level of fuckery
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:36:13
Where do we go from here? Anyone have any idea of any recourse i have to recover my coin i had on the exchange? This is a lot of money and I certainly never committed a crime with it.
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:20:04
Lets be real, this is terrible advice. There is real risk in btc and telling people to ignore it is going to cause people to get hurt.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:53:35
Didnt jihan agree to segwit and a promise of 2mb blocks on ltc or did i misinterpret that?
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:40:02
I like segwit2x
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:43:50
Token offerings are a great use case for eth. It is pretty much the primary function at this point. The problem is people investing in shit they haven't done their due diligence on.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:51:03




  
  
The thing I find the most ignorant is berating someone for asking a question. Since you obviously dont understand the technical implementation enough to answer my question you can fuck right off dickbag.
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:19:42
he completely ignores the part where people losing faith in btc are switching to eth
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:36:19
how does bitcoin not have the capacity to support segwit+2mb?
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:50:16
there will be another bump when the actually signalling gets started and hits 80%. Then i think it will stagnate/dip depending on how much saber rattling to get people to keep segwit but resist the hf. Once the hf happens i think sky is the limit though
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:39:47
no actually it doesnt. I read it and it doesnt explain the how segwit blocks count transaction sizes and why they wanted to make that change. It's fucking weird that you think my technical question is a matter of subjectivity vs objectivity
@_date: 2017-06-02 19:16:27
he'll probably be able to buy like 3 girlfriends by then
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:55:10
hmm i just tapped out what i still had in exchanges from when i sold at the top. Debating if I want to add more
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:03:49
I actually bought in at 600 and stocks are in a fairly large bubble. There is more leverage in the system now than there was in 2008. Central Banks have 15 trillion in assets on their books. Asset valuations have gone up way more than gdp which is literally the definition of a bubble. I'm 50% in crypto atm and will gradually move more into crypto the more this bubble inflates.
  
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:42:56
I am aware eth hasnt been handling large icos well yet it works fine the majority of the time. BTC is currently horrible the vast majority of the time. So yeah eth is still better for short confirmation times and low fees.

they havent run into serious scaling issues yet so atm it is the path of least resistance to short confirmation times and low fees

So if the restaurant can simply open up another room to get rid of the line you think they should keep the room closed?

I got charged a 10% on two small ~$15 transactions. Still waiting for coinbase to respond to any of my 3 emails explaining why the fee was so high. According to their fess page it looks like it should be a lot lower.

wont segwit+2mb kill asicboost?
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:39:04
on ltc? I thought that that activated already?
@_date: 2017-06-26 19:12:43
why permanently?
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:44:58
How hard is it to just fucking do segwit + 2mb blocks?
@_date: 2017-06-24 05:14:24
what? you're not racist just mindless and easily controlled.
@_date: 2017-06-24 05:08:17
2mb is a big block? do you even know why you are supposed to hate big blocks?
@_date: 2017-06-20 21:12:13
my point is no one scared miners into segwit2x. this is what they wanted for over a year
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:15:06
How many core devs are there? Do you seriously think those are the only great programmers in the world?
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:28:30
You guys really want to do a hostile takeover of a $40B asset? That's a good way to get it to go to 0
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:56:26
lmao. could you be any more toxic?
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:43:55
why? The scaling roadmap seems fairly solidified. Should reduce uncertainty. It did cause what almost 10% move? I just figured considering how long the debate was going on and the level of uncertainty it would have bumped more.
@_date: 2017-06-19 22:20:06
That doesnt answer my question
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:23:18
so you want to do a hostile takeover to prevent a hostile takeover? sounds like a lose lose. Except just because miners aren't doing what you want doesnt make it a hostile takeover
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:44:28
the debate has been going on for 2 years now. How much more patience do you want?
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:40:33
If you know the history of btc you would know segwit2x was agreed on by the miners over a year ago in Hong Kong. it was always supposed to be segwit2x
