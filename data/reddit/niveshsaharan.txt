If the seller is new and the package is sealed, would it be safe?

I believe the best way to stop myself from selling is Transferring the balance to Paper wallet or something where we can’t sell without transfer back. 
In June, I had them on exchange and couldn’t stop myself from selling at loss. I don’t want to get hit by another loss in just 4 months. 
I bought at 7800$. Friends are saying Bcash is future and I reject their proposal of buying. It’s really hard to not believe them.

Do they charge fee? Is it something similar to local bitcoins?

Bitcoin was the first decentralized currency, operating with no central authority or banks. Therefore it cannot be banned, as no one owns it. Bitcoin is big, it’s being accepted by more and more places, like Amazon, Microsoft, Expedia to name a few.
Countries can opt to make it difficult to use there, but it can never be banned.
