You should be able to check the transaction to see if it has been verified. Are you 110% sure you sent them to the correct address?  
If you sent coins to the wrong address (you mistyped) they're gone. =/

I'm investing a set amount of my total income per year, I 
don't plan to sell for short-term gains.  While I was investing in the stock market I would always buy and eventually sell netting a quick profit, it would range maybe just 20% or even +100% on a rare occasion. It wasn't a bad option, I made sure to cover my costs and walk away, keeping myself protected. However, you'd be surprised how often you can lose on daytrades, it's not the best strategy because when you lose it hurts.  
Looking back on the majority of the companies stocks I purchased around 2013 if I held my first original position until today I would've been up more than 200% to even +1000% in most of them. It's great to purchase a company and net a quick 20-30% return, however the more times you trade the more risk you're accepting not to mention fee's they add up a lot. It's a lot easier to set aside an amount and not worry about it, if you continue to buy and sell, you'll burn yourself eventually it's difficult to time the market, if not impossible. It's better to just look at any of your investments as a potential lottery ticket (poor choice of words) if you're not worried about the total amount you're investing and prices skyrocket in the next 1-5 years, you'll be glad you held onto your ticket.  
If you're only "investing" what you can afford to lose, you won't have to worry day to day about pricing. Don't put yourself in that position. I've seen too many posts about people exchanging coins for others only to miss a big upswing and regret it.

I never said Bitcoin / Crypto was gambling at a Casino, taking out a $325,000 loan against your house to invest in anything, is about the same.   
The only difference is that Bitcoin turned out to be massively profitable, I believe crypto will continue to be successful but putting yourself at that level of risk is just foolish, period.

I tried to do this, but I had issues with my bank and the price jumped :(
Guess, I'll just have to get in at the low price of 7400

It wasn't a smart play by any means, he took a lot of risk with 0 guarantees. It's the equivalent of going to a casino and playing your life savings on red or black, he just ended up on the right side. There are countless stories of others making emotional decisions while investing and losing everything, and others should be very cautious and not use this as an example of success.
