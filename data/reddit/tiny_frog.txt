Their percieved need for a negative interest rate also drives their wish to make fiat into "stable" crypto. If all fiat is exchanged by an e-fiat on a blockchain, their power to enforce negative rates increases tremendously.

“However, we believe the dollar could lose its status as the world’s dominant currency ... due to **structural reasons** as well as cyclical impediments.”
Structual reasons means the US state debt can never be repaid.
Cyclical impediments means Trump's trade war vs China.
I'm surprised they publish this as JP Morgan are the one of the banks that profit from the dollar's world currency status. I guess sleezebag Jamie Dimon (CEO) cannot control what every expert in his bank publish. :)

When Bitcoin is sent, the receiving wallet can see it's "trying" to be sent very quickly. "Trying" means that the sender has requested the transfer - but it's not registered onto the blockchain yet.
Roughly every ten minutes a new block is created on the Bitcoin blockchain. If your Bitcoin is on the new blocks, many wallets shows how many "confirmations" the transaction has (one confirmation per new block).
Unless it's big money, you can be content with very few confirmations.

Huh, so this may be the first "Bitcoin bank"?
As in a "bank" without fiat deposits, but instead crypto deposits. (For the record: I know you don't need a bank with Bitcoin, you can be your own.)
@_date: 2019-07-16 11:44:47


Seems like they started just that path.
I'd wager 80% of central bankers and politicians don't know what a big threat crypto is to fiat. And those who realize that many fiats will eventually come down crashing, they are smart enough to not say anything that quickens the sequence of events - because they will loose their jobs, be called incompetent etc at that time. Instead they preach that crypto is only used by money launderers and drug dealers. And other "double plus good" talk.
@_date: 2019-07-03 16:49:15
This highlights why a finite supply of Bitcoin will outvalue USD or any fiat in the long rung. I'm still amazed that not more politicians realise it. 
But when the dollar foundation eventually is challenged, it will rock the boat pretty big. :)
@_date: 2019-07-03 21:37:30
Yeah, you are probably right that a few politicians realize it. 
I admire Ron Paul even if I'm from Sweden. There is only one other politician I can say that about, I find most stupid or detestable. Ron immediately struck me as a good guy with sound thinking. It's a bit sad that so few honest and intelligent men and women are selected as our representatives.

It seems some congress reps want to classify FB as a bank. And FB desperately trying to not be classified as a bank.
EDIT: I'm now almost three hours into the hearing and the only think the FB lawyer can say: "We will abide by AML, KYC etc rules. Libra is only a payment system, not a bank." Incredible little substance in any of his answers. This will only irritate politicians and does not help FB prospects in the US.

Those stupid politicians think they can curb inflation by setting up capital controls (e.g. not allowed to use anything but the official shite fiat). 
It's the poorest people who get wrecked by it, more wealthy have other options. Sad.
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:28:36


Totally agree. I've studied economics at university and everything except statistics is a load of unprovable theories. Additionally most theories only work in situations where reality had to be grossly simplified (or make other limiting assumptions) to make the model "work".
National economists had to scrap a lot of existing macro theories after the 2009 crash, when they had to admit banks are not just unimportant intermediaries. And micro economics still likes to assume outrageous things, like customer's has perfect information or they behave rational. Empiric evidence is impossible to get, because you can never reproduce a cause &amp; effect with the same specific conditions. Validity is a real problem.
IMHO it's time to stop calling economics a science.
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:51:59
Let me summarize the financial disruption in my view.
Decentralized crypto is a new thing in the financial markets. Governments nor banks cannot ban decentralized crypto because nobodoy owns them, there is no CEO to put in jail and the network is supported by lots of anonymous users.
Decentralized crypto removes the need for a third party to make payments or just to hold the crypto, i.e. there is no need for banks, credit/debit cards nor PayPal et al. Governments cannot put AML-regulations on the actual crypto or make laws that affects their freedom. Governments can only target exchanges (where you exchange your fiat for crypto). Decentralized cryptos are very scary to central banks, politicians and banks (meaning many of their modus operandi will not be viable in the future).
Companies are driven by profit, so some will create centralized crypto trying to make money. Ripple is one example and Libra is another. These centralized cryptos are NOT decentralized crypto, they are instead a form of company-money. This gives profit to the companies and that is their purpose (compared to fiat money that gives power/profit to governments and banks). If you are interested in economics history, please look up what "scrip" is.
My advice is to invest in the real revolution. The real disruptive tech, i.e. the DECENTRALIZED cryptos
And please stay the hell out of Libra. ;)

The moon is not straight up. You need a tilted angle (from most places) to get there. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:59:51
I did not write the word "asset" anywhere. I tried to explain what creates it's value for some people.
And some people **will** define BTC as "an item of value owned" or "a single item of ownership having exchange value" that also are words to describe what an asset is. 
Personally I don't care what BTC is called. When I assess if it's good to invest in it, I look for it's current use-case (I've used BTC to send payments 5 times this week), current values, future use-cases and future value. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:19:55
Yep, the latter has around 50% chance of being corerct. Politicians seems only to realize a fact/situation a long time after it has passed.

This is also needs highlighting (bold text made by me).
*"... Marcus wrote that* ***a subsidiary of the social media*** *giant (unrelated to Libra)* ***stores “non-public personal financial information data,” such as payment credentials***, in compliance with existing law for transactions, but that this information is not used for advertising or for personalization."
Considering FB's lousy track reckord on respecting and protecting private data, I'd rather not be in that database.
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:58:38
YES precisely!! 
You summed it up in a great way. This is the essence I feel when I read or encounter-in-person these thoughts. And it's often damn hard to change my perspective and start an explanation from a very basic level.
Therefore it feels exhilarating to meet those few people in my surrounding that understands the potential and benefits from BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:51:20
Some other countries went down that road even further. You are jailed from using BTC in Venezuela and some other.
The US seems to have taken another step when some late congress or senate (I don't remember the details) discussed to outlaw holding secret BTC. 
Many fiat currencies are IMHO backed by blackmail and maffia methods.
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:52:05
If you replace the words "want to" with "will" and the second "want to" with "will buy and" you hopefully get what I meant. 
You are not going to buy BTC (because you don't want it enough to act on it) so you don't impact BTC's price.
@_date: 2019-07-12 06:18:07

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:55:23
The value comes the same way fiat money gets it; some people thinks it's valuable and hence want to trade and hold it. Those people are prepared to buy it with Yen, Renmibi, USD, EUR or Bolivar. Their trust and desire to get it drives its value.  
Many people (pehaps you also) are not going to buy BTC because they don't want it. 
I know it's hard for many to understand how people can buy "nothing" for real fiat money - but it's their decision and you cannot do anything about it. Better accept it. :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:23:25
Or he/she can move the BTC to a wallet and nobody at IRS will know if or when the gain is realized (and thus taxable). After a couple of years there  will be plenty more opportunities to spend the BTC (from the wallet) on goods.

Rich people buy properties, companies, land, gold, art etc - and those are UNAFFECTED by inflation.
It's the poorer who cannot save money in inflationary-protected ways that get shafted. It's the worker's pensions that goes to hell. Those who have taken on loans will find them harder to repay. So NO, inflation affects poorer people more than it affects rich.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:00:30
From a BTC-perspective that would actually be good. :) More fiat inflation = more people will want to protect their savings and pensions from inflation.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:31:25

Great article. I agree on all except the "core devs" being untrustworthy (the latter is because I know too little about how the community of developers work on BTC). 
@_date: 2018-09-01 13:11:54
IMHO that is a much too short perspective. Fiat currencies inflates themselves to death normally after decades of misuse - therefore Bitcoin should be compared to fiat on a 5-10 years time scale.
Yes, crypto will change how governments take on debt, manages their budget and inflates their fiat by money printing (though I know it's not the "printing" that inflates the money supply).
Why? Because finally there is an decentralized independent global currency that competes with peoples trust for a much needed currency. More and more people will leave their fiat and place their savings in more secure crypto. The wide swings in crypto value will stabilize more and more as the market matures.
Ask people in Argentina which they trust more; their toilet paper fiat or BTC? Ask India (after the coup where 86% of their fiat was made invalid), Turkey (having lost almost 50% of it's value in a year, Venezuela (no comments needed), South Africa or even China (who tries to control and lock up peoples fiat money). Then compare it to the USA and ask yourself if you really believe the US-dollar will keep its value 10 years from now...

Do you honestly see it as a remote possibility that the US government &amp; central bank would want give up unlimited money printing? The US state want's inflation to eat up their large debt they have to their citizen's future retirement funds, health care and issue government bonds. They WANT that large debt burden to slowly diminish itself from inflation.
And if they made a US-crypto they can print more of when they need or make it inflationary (the same way as with their fiat-USD), nobody with a brain would touch it with a 10-feet pole.
I find this the least of future worries.

Good thinking. I would like to repeat:
"-*There is no such thing as intrinsic value. ...*"

Turkey also declared Bitcoin Bitcoin “Not Compatible” for Muslims.
IMHO this is again great news. The pope declared the earth was flat a long time ago and now Turkey's "Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet)" are declaring what to think about krypto. 
I'm quite sure this is an advertisement for most Muslims to get involved in BTC rather sooner than later. Those with a brain knows their government and "leaders" are just trying to keep the power to themselves. :)
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:34:55

I'm no expert but I think you need to create a wallet/account to be able to receive BTC. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:22:24
The article fails to clarify that whenever somebody buys certificates, the company will buy BTC for the same amount and put them into storage (cold storage from what I've read).
This is opening the door for people without the will/skill to indirectly trade BTC and make their savings follow bitcoin. I know it's better to buy bitcoin yourself (without a third party), but not everyone is ready for that. If a person can live with the risk, their savings will follow the BTC-price.
IMHO it's a good complementary way to get started in Bitcoin. People who bought their ETN when it started in 2015, have made big profits percentage wise. (And the company sold the forked Bitcoin Cash and paid certificate owners corresponding amounts.)
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:05:06
Very good talk and you are able to communicate some Bitcoin and libertarian thoughts in a very positive way (where you roll with the journalist question and don't go into hard opposition immediately). I wish more interviews were made in this constructive way.
@_date: 2018-08-25 13:30:34
The bank you use can see that you bought/sold ETN, but for them to "censor" would need the bank to be in China, Venezuela and some other countries. There are countries where this third-party-risk is low.
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:42:45
When Bitchcoin Cash (BCH) was forked from Bitcoin, it took some months before XBTProvider had sold the shitcoins and credited my bank account with the corresponding amount. I calculated how much BCH I should get from my indirect BTC-ownership - and the sum I got into my bank account was within 2 % that.
To me it's further proof that XBTProvider actually hold BTC and are a decent company that DID pay me back forked altcoin-sales.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:46:23
I agree. I discovered XBTProvider after much hassle buying Bitcoin via LocalBitcoins. It was so much easier to buy these certificates, from my normal bank account and without any more registration or approval.
I know there is a risk that the company could get hacked or the coins stolen from storage and it's a risk I'm willing to live with.
As is written elsewhere. Whenever people buy the ETN, it will affect the "real" bitcoin market (because those bitcoins are bought by the company). This is different compared to how the futures-products work (as those are NOT backed by real bitcoins).
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:14:40
I agree, here's my support.
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:59:30
Short name:  Bitcoin XBTE

@_date: 2018-08-18 21:09:44
I'm not sure what "txs" stands for. Would appreciate a clarification before I answer. :)
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:35:25
Agree, the company DOES hold the underlying asset. In one way XBTProvider can be seen as a wallet service. Whenever somebody buys for 100 fiat, the company buys Bitcoin and put them into storage (cold storage from what I've read). You cannot transact with your Bitcoins, but they are kept in storage as long as you do not sell your ETN-certificates.
The risk is /as always when using middlemen/ that the company could get hacked or the coins stolen by employees.
The benefit is a super easy way to buy into Bitcoin with fiat, from your normal financial account and without extra registration or approvals. IMHO an ETN is very similar to an ETF when it comes to user friendliness.
@_date: 2018-05-04 07:56:55
Huh, thanks for enlightening me. :\)
@_date: 2018-08-19 08:03:02
Yes, I have traded the ETN on my Swedish broker account. I cannot short it.
I guess you were looking for an US answer but I can give some fact on how it works here.
The entry fee on the ETN certificates is 2.5%/year. I'm not sure it that will be the same in the US. The risk is /as always with intermediaries/ that you do not own the keys. The value of the ETNs follow more or less the value of BTC on a 1:1 ratio.
Regarding how ETN compares to an ETF. [ Differences;  ETN is unsecured debt and does not have the tracking errors that ETF can have.
The main point is that when you buy the XBTProvider-ETN, the company buys BTC for the same amount and put them into cold storage. When Bitcoin Cash was forked, it took some months and then the company sold the BCH and credited the ETN-owners that amount (corresponding to how much BTC they owned at the fork time).
This opened up indirect BTC-ownwership for less-tech-savy people in 2015 and it has been a success for those investors.

I'm from Sweden and I definitely do not think socialism has anything to do with happiness ratings. And trust me, it does not work well at all. It's like a milder form of communism \(many old school socialist here were closely affiliated with Soviet\).
It's true we have a low corruption, but again that has nothing to do with socialism or or the more extreme communism.

I see one big flaw. When coloring "Sovereign \(Government issued\)" the table makes Low be red and High be green. 
IMO it's the opposite. If there is no government involved, the asset is much more secure. No government or central bank involvement is good and green. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:24:38
Good explanation! 
Buying and selling stocks, bonds and Bitcoin will get your net profits taxed by 30% in Sweden. 
BUT if you make the same investments in an ISK (Investment Account) your tax is always 30% of state interest rate (1.49%) times the NET worth. This means your fixed tax is less than half a percent of the total value. Swedish reference   [
TLDR: ETN-Bitcoin profits in an ISK-account are almost tax free in Sweden. This makes the ability to trade ETNs favorable compared to taxing real BTC-profits. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:12:34
IMO you should take it as mostly positive. Not many realize the big shift that will happen \(i.e. when some fiat will be hit by huge inflation and some other fiat will be corroded by bad state and bank finances\).

Well said and good summary.
I especially like your conclusion "Countries have two options: default on the debt or destroy the value of the currency. Right now, the US is hanging in there because it's destroying the value of USD slowly, hoping nobody notices, and they're able to [outsource inflation]( to other countries \(somewhat\) due to being a reserve currency...."

God idea and thanks for spreading the word. :)
The example on the front page is actually quite acute. A child cannot have a bank account in most countries (because of stagnant rules and government trying to "protect" its citizens from wrongoing) but they can use Bitcoin! It's the same example of BTS's best use-case; poor people, people shut out of banking or minority groups in countries with repressive governments. They have no access to bank accounts, but can use BTC -  regardless of what their corrupt and stone age politicians think (whose opinion's are pushed further via banks).

The presentation to SEC was a very interesting read! (225 pages) [
It shows the robustness of their BTC price setting and how hard it's nowadays to manipulate. I suspected this was the case, but the presentation gives a critical view on how the the top 10 exchanges behave. It's not often you read words that a new financial commodity is working better than most other commodities (except gold which is close).
@_date: 2019-03-23 11:10:23
I reread 88-89 and yes "Unique Resistance" and "Surveillance Sharing" seems to be essential for SEC.
I do not think many already SEC-approved ETF:s fullfill the Unique-requirement to 100%. Most smaller funds can be market manipulated to a small degree or for a short while (and the same applies for bigger funds but the cost for manipulation increases). It's a matter of good enough. I may be incorrect but the SEC cannot have different standards for allowing a BTC ETF, compared to already approved financial-paper-X-ETF.
Surveillance will also have to be "good enough" or else the US will probably never get a BTC ETF. Isn't Kraken already refusing New York-customers? (Or perhaps even all US-customers?) I guess Kraken do not want to be bogged down in deep US monitoring, bureacracy and possibly expesive future lawsuits.
Thanks for pointing those pages out. The judgement and interpretation will probably be an important deciding factor for the SEC.
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:31:13
Good post IMHO as you take a perspective that many has of us have. We can only afford to save x amount into BTC - but I still think this will make a difference in the long term.
We all have our struggles day to day and most of us work to make ends meet. Still I think BTC-savers are a bit special because we both realize what a paradigm shift will come and we also have a idealogical idea about decentraliced money/savings should be.
I do not know about your thinking, but the more I learn about Bitcoin and what the central banks are doing, the more I feel the need to get out of "their" system.

@_date: 2019-03-23 13:27:53
If I may simplify a LOT, there are two groups;
1. Bitcoiners who like the libertarian and/or technical aspects. These tend to strongly dislike regulations, central authorities, middle-men etc.
2. Non "believers" and/or non-tech-savy who are in BTC for a million different reasons (mostly trading, investment or sending payments cheaply and freely). These are often in favour of regulation and "simpler" (albeit more risky) solutions to invest in BTC.
I think the two groups will exist in parallell for a long time. Until buying proper BTC gets more user friendly, coming solutions for group 2 will take on "mainstream" people. And because anybody can build upon BTC - even making an ETF based on it - it's likely that ETFs will pop up sooner or later.
But I do not know if simpler decentralized solutions will happen before ETFs are used by many.

@_date: 2019-03-22 22:19:42
Yes, I read 90% of the 225 pages, it took a while. Did you read it?
I disagree, the presentation shows /among other things/ a tight price spreads/arbitrage on 10 top exchanges, why a weighted and mean BTC-price is hard to manipulate on the 10 top exchanges and how safe key management can be obtained. The author hopes this is enough for the SEC to accept the ETF.
When I say "shows" I do not mean "prove" in a logical way. Not much can be proven in the bog of economics. ;) Perhaps indicates is a better word? But I edited my post adding "their" BTC-price setting - you had a valid point there. :)
EDIT: I find it strange that the US is so slow to accept an ETF. On page 194 you can see that Sweden got an ETN in March 2015 (BTC was around 250 USD then). From a retail perspective, there is not much difference to an ETF (except the formal ownership of the commodity). That ETN helped a lot of non-tech-savy people to start saving indirectly in BTC. Of course with the added risk of not owning their own keys - but that was a risk that was worth taking considering some of them do not need to work anymore.
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:24:51

I just wanted to offer another perspective and it is the BTC/USD exchange rate that is base for that. 
Here's another take. Say 20 years in the future there are no fiat money anymore, everybody is using e-currency with a fixed supply. When they analyze what is happening right now, they could say that the USD started to fall faster in 2017 (compared to BTC) and there was several 3% mini-crashes in Nov 2017. :)
(Sorry if I'm not 100% clear. I'm not native English speaking and that makes it a little bit hard to explain.)

If the North-Korea-fear is the cause of the recent BitCoin gain, then that is important. Not just that it caused a gain, but also that investors look to BitCoin as a safe haven or hedge (so it was not dragged down with most other investments). IMHO that could be a very important cause-and-effect when we see big economic crisis in the future. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 10:19:20
When I look at the stock-to-flow models it seems the major price movement (up) happens some months after the halvening. So expect a price surge, but not immediately on or after the halvening in May. 
Safest bet would be to evaluate price 6 months after the halvening. At that time the immediate hype have died and demand/supply have stabilized.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:08:29
I can only offer how to buy BTC in Sweden via a mobile (and advice for UK), via an ETN (meaning Electronically Traded Note). An ETN behaves very like an ETF (i.e. fund)  One ETN is backed up by a 5% share in a BitCoin. Avanza started offering this in October 2015 - which is very early IMHO.  
1) Become customer at Avanza using your mobile BankID. 
2) Set up a free-of-charge ISK (Investeringsparkonto) so that any profits are not taxed. 
3) Transfer money from your normal bank to Avanza
4) Buy  
Hargreaves Lansdown in the UK recently also started offering to sell the BitCoin-ETN to their customers.

On Coindesk  a recent article concluded that crypto-currency-time/trading is 12 times faster than normal stock, bond and FX exchanges. If you combine this with the excessive monetary policies and greedy government capital controls, then you get unstoppable value increase over time for Bitcoin.
I've been saving /long-term/ more and more into Bitcoin and it's going take something extra ordinary to change this from being very good investment. I'd advice the same to everyone, hold your BTC-savings for a long time... :)

Look at Venezuela and you get a concrete example of why a fiat could disappear. Same story on other countries that are mis-managing their economy. 
I'm not saying it's likely all currencies go away, it's not. But there is a slim chance that BTC (or some other e-currency) ends up as the world currency that everything is measured in. If you just can go with the idea, then you get the perspective I'm trying to offer.

Not only "supply of money" drives the price, Bitcoin is also making an attempt to be a "store of value". As such it would compete with people's, companies' and state's savings in gold, state bonds etc.  
Gold has a market cap of somewhat less than 10 trillion USD and state bonds over 100 trillion USD.

"*Though I don't think anyone could make a better attempt than we have.*"
Because they admit to failing to find a driver,  my trust in them increase. They seem legit.
"*The fact that we couldn't find what drove bitcoin, frankly, means that there isn't a predictive signal to be found," Selbert added*"
I could have told them two significant price drivers;
* fiat inflation and
* corruption/distrust in the "normal" financial ecosystem (state and private).
The second is nigh impossible to catch in any statistical analysis and the former is hidden by shite inflation measurements.

I also agree, the crypto cycle is much quicker than the normal investement highs and lows. I read an article that proposed Bitcoin has a faster cycle than normal assets because it's traded 24/7 (whereas normal asset trading are closed for holidays and evenings). The article proposed the cycle for crypto is at least 5X faster than normal non-24/7-assets. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:00:02
IMHO the first heavy dip is the hardest. When -35% of the value has gone away in a few days, it's easy to start doubting. 
The key is to HODL no matter what!
Say to yourself "I accept that a recovery may take long, but this coin will still beat any savings in the long run. And when some government mismanage their finances too badly, a central bank floods their fiat currency too much OR a national debt bubble pops, the reverse will happen on a MUCH larger scale." :)
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:19:15
I agree about your analysis, this is likely the explanation to the fuss.
Don't blame the banks in this case. They are just doing what they have been ordered to do by governments; to monitor payments and stop money laundering.
IMHO the AML-rules are not effective nor juste. The rules/processes cost society more than they catch laundered money. And my main objection is that **people should be allowed to send payments to whomever they want** (comparable to the freedom of speech or the freedom to send an e-mail to whomever you want). The AML-directives goes directly against that freedom.

If it's true that 30% of workers own Bitcoin, that is huge IMHO.
"*Moreover, Bitcoinist reported yesterday that South Korea’s largest bank by assets* [*KB Kookmin*]( *took an about turn decision on cryptocurrency and will be developing custody solutions.* "
And banks accepting Bitcoin won't go away, is also adoption.

Agreed, XRP is backed by big corps and centralized.

A minus 3% rate would mean you normally cannot save for a new car, apartment, house, your children's education nor your own pension. Your investments have to grow by 3% just to break even. 
If you save in something that gives less than 3%, then you would get poorer for trying to save.

It originates from a very early message board post about Bitcoin. The author talks about holding your coins but spells it wrong. Somebody else might be able to provide a link.

I agree and only wonder what time frame to expect. When will enough countries be devaluing their currency at the same time, to make the devaluation ineffective?

@_date: 2017-11-02 12:01:33
The chance of that happening is extremely small. Politicians and central bankers won't wake up until some fiat currencies crashed.
I'm more worried that users get confused and hurt by the coming B2X fork. The only risk I see right now, is a prolonged war between two almost equally long and used coins; BTC and B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:10:41
I agree that forced adoption (by inflation or taxation/regulation by greedy governments) is the speediest way for people to realize the unique and useful properties of Bitcoin. 
Because of the slow process to scale Bitcoin (to be able to provide cheap p2p-payments) I would guess Venezuelans will also turn to cheaper payment coins (e.g. Litecoin). When Lightning network is implemented, then BTC can again be used for smaller transactions. And that will clog up the queue, resulting in higher fees again. After Lightning network something else comes around after while.
What I really hope for is that more governments and central banks lending and bad balances will be forced into the open for bigger countries. When more people understand that fiat is not safe, that will become a big stampede towards cryptos.
Let's say that Greece finally says "enough is enough" and defaults. That will most likely topple some Italian banks, which in turn will crash Portuguese and probably Spanish banks. When those governments starts bailing out their shitty banks, the market will become worried about their ability to repay all their debts. Inflation will finally hit some countries that haven't seen it in decades.
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:13:52
I agree with you!
IMHO the crypto change is en par with the internet-change. Sadly the internet protocol missed out the privacy aspect - something bad companies and governments exploit. Look at 1984:ish China... The bad control-aspects-from-internet-usage will be helped by decentralised and private cryptos.
People who think otherwise do not understand how decentralised crypto will change the world. The biggest change will come to payment-servcies (a part of many banks) and central banks (who cannot control it). The best change will be when politicians are forced to understand they cannot continue pushing the debt mountain to future generations - but that will take a few countries going bankrupt before the morons understand.
Crypto will also change so that a parent can actually save something for their children, the middle class can save for a car/apartment/house - without the value being destroyed by the annual inflation.
@_date: 2019-02-16 12:05:24

@_date: 2017-11-16 14:09:02
IMHO BitCoin will first make a run to replace gold (and some other long term investments). As for now BitCoin is more a store-of-value than a micro-payment-currency.
Currently BitCoin cannot scale to handle as many payments as fiat does, but that may change with upgrades in the future. 
But yes, first stabilize as an important store-of-value and in the long run hopefully /with added scaleabiltiy/ also be used for normal payments.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:52:35
In that case Libra would move away from being a centralized fiat shitcoin. IMHO that will not happen anytime soon.
Let me remind you; Facebook's whole purpose is to make money for its investors. If fakebook had to buy crypto to back Libra, they would loose the option to print as much as they want/can - and thereby loose the power to make money for Libra's investors.

The EU-leaders seems to have gone bonkers. :) It seems they are so afraid of a recession, they will use any method in their power.
"*The ECB’s governing council left the benchmark refinancing deposit rate at zero and the deposit rate at -0.4%. The Bank also noted that it would give credit at rates just 10 basis points above its -0.4% deposit rate,* ***effectively paying them to take its money***\*.\*"
This will fuel all investments, including Bitcoin. Nobody wants to hold Euro (due to negative interest rate) and you get paid to take up loans in Euro. People will take up loans and look everywhere to get positive rates or increased value of stock/property/gold/crypto etc.
For a short while financial markets will continue to be happy. But the blowout (when markets eventually crash) will be even harder.

After the exchanges were banned, people started trading on WeChat (and other social media). That got censored so now people had to adapt even further (VPNs, even other social medias, using language that isn't stopped). In effect the bans and censoring educated people how to trade under the govenrment's radar even better. 
Next time China wants to ban Bitcoin they will find it impossible...

I bough a fraction of a real BTC into a wallet, but XBT-provider are the reason I could quickly move some pension savings to BTC without the hassle it is to either use LocalBitCoins or an exchange. I have them to thank a lot and they are very much worth the small fee they take. I'm surprised not more people got into their ETN sooner, they are available in 179 countries...

My guess is this change the payment industry (i.e. banks, Visa, Master card, PayPal etc) A LOT. It will need some time to get implemented for normal people to use, but the road there has taken another important step.
And I would love if it also helps users to retain privacy even better.
@_date: 2019-02-21 07:31:18
I agree with your intentions, but I do not understand why you say "Tumblers are obsolete." IMHO Tumblers have been and still are more important/relevant than the wallet you propose - when trying to make crypto intraceable.
The privacy aspects of BTC can and will improve further, be it from tumblers, wallets or the protocol itself. I think Tumblers will not be needed when BTC and the sorrounding network are developed more.

My guess is they misunderstood "Bank the unbanked." and thought it was "Bank the bank." ;)
But seriously this is very positive news for adaption. When more non-tech people easily can get BTC, they will also learn and the next step is for the to hold their keys.
@_date: 2019-06-12 16:10:20
I totally agree that the stock-to-flow theory is the best price model I've seen so far.
When Bitcoin will expand it's use-cases (smart contracts etc etc) and be used by more people, I think it will decouple itself from the theory. At that point the network will have so many other uses cases and the network effect will be so big, that the stock-to-flow will not be enough to explain the price.
@_date: 2019-12-01 11:10:43
Yes, it's correct. Why? Because it's based on mathematics/science and it's decentralized (meaning no bank/politician/state has any power over it).
Still as people have pointed out. You need to keep your key safe (memorize or store/hide it) but that is usually easy or doable.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:18:51
I would welcome such news. There will sure be a dip and perhaps a time with low hash power until difficulty adjusts, but the result would be a more decentralized mining situation for BTC.
That said, I'm 90% sure China will not shut down the miners. The parasitic and totalitarian government will more likely try to find some way to tax the miners.  As that's hard, the first step will be to threaten miners that they will be imprisoned unless they declare and tax BTC-mining-income.

I foresee that every banked or unbanked person can receive, pay or store their wealth without central authorities intervention. This may not be big in some of the western countries, but the shittier and more corrupt politicians and state bureacrats, the more important this gets.
IMHO it's giving back some freedom to the individual. Not everyone wants to live in a brainwashed China that keeps a social score on each of their citizens (and then deny the misdemeanors air or fast-train travel, the right to go abroad, good schools for their children).

"We need to catch criminals, but not at the cost of EVERY person's freedom." Many people do not consider that all rules coming from AML and KYC diminishes their freedom. Neither do they consider all indirect cost; banks have done huge regulatory projects to meet AML-rules. These rules, systems and AML-departments cost money to operate/maintain/support. That cost is /of course/ just shuffled down the line to the end customer. People get mad at the banks, but it's government's rules that are behind.
The state seem not to care when they diminish freedom and impose substantial cost for people. There must be better and more effective ways to work against crime.

Wow, this is very good news IMHO. :)
And even if it take years before BTC has its much needed privacy, I now hope that some 2nd layer-solution can beat the long development-timescale BTC needs and has.
When BTC finally gets good privacy (regardless if it comes on-chain or on 2nd layer), we will read about how politicians and central banks will change their tune (after some time when they realize what privacy means to their wanted financial control over people's money).

Good job! Not a moment too soon.
When I chose an exchange some years ago, I considered two variables:
1. Never ever make business with anything that gets you involved with the US IRS (if you are not already in their grasp)! Avoid all US based exchanges like plague. You do NOT want to mess with the IRS, if you live outside the US.
2. Try to find an exchange that has both expertise in the area AND a moral sense.

IMHO Keynesianism is similar to socialism in the regard they think the state knows better than the market (or majority of people if you wish) and it's possible to "game" the economic cycles. I do not think that is effective nor possible, and I agree with you.
As Ron Paul say in that video, it's not possible for any central person to predict what the interest rate nor price of money should be. You can gamble on a guesstimate yes, but the central bank/politicians are nowhere near being scientific.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:06:01
I believe Bitcoin (or other decentralized e-currencies) will change the world to the better. More freedom and power to individuals, less to centralized structures. 
Most people haven't understood that this is the change coming from BTC. Empowerment of every individual compared to a 1984-scenario where more and more control, power and influence lies in the hands of parasites.

Thanks for your clear answer! I checked using ipconfig /all and after "DHCP Enabled" it says "YES". So I take it I'm not having a static IP-address, it's dynamic.
My ASUS connects to another router that was mandatory installed in all 40 apartments in the house. I did not trust it, so I bough one of my own. The "mandatory" router has been configured (by the provider) so one of the four connections at its back is totally open. The cable/signal from the mandatory to my ASUS is just "forwarded" without using any functions in the mandatory router.
Lastly we have a a bigger communal router in the basement. This serves 40 apartments in the house and it's connected to a big internet highway close by.

Thank you and your answer confirms what I read in the other post. (I wasn't sure I understood it correctly.)

@_date: 2019-04-03 18:14:42
Totally agree.
But your example is very mild. In Sweden you pay 55%+ on everything you earn above approx 40 K EUR. On top of that comes very high taxes for the corporation whenever they pay somebody salary. Look at this graph  [ they have summed the total taxes for wages and corporate wage tax to 69%.
On top of that we have a VAT of 25%. And the extra taxes on fuel and alcohol are VERY high on top of that. Plus a tax if you own your own house.
The shit government thinks the remedy is to raise minimum wages... This will totally remedy the problem of corporates not wanting to hire.  /s

*"I'm wondering whether bitcoin will become more valuable because the infrastructure is more useful than our current system or if it will become more valuable because the US dollar is becoming less valuable. "*
Bitcoins primary use-case for now is **store of value**. If things progress well (Ligthing Network etc), Bitoin's second use case may be **payments**.
**Store of value** means you can exchange your fiat money into BTC and know its value is not devalued by inflation, Quantative Easing or any other activities made by central banks and governments. The  **Store of Value** is achieved by many people trusting BTC and through the network-effect. The more people who use it, the more useful it becomes.
**Payments** mean that any person, even those not allowed a bank account or credit/debit card, HAVE the option of getting BTC and sending it to whoever they want without any bank nor politician stopping it. Currently the BTC payment can be made quicker and cheaper compared to bank transfers cross border. The BTC fees will fluctuate until Lightning Network and other future scaling solutions are implemented more broadly.
My humble advice is to stop comparing it only to the dollar. BTC is a world currency and should be compared to all other contry specific currencies (not just the dollar). :) The payment infrastructure is not yet competitive to VISA and Master Card (scale wise), but it may very well become so.
@_date: 2019-04-06 06:43:55

@_date: 2019-04-19 03:32:58
Haha, yes that is good advice. Perhaps he should also show a picture (of the pros) when withdrawing the money? I'm sure the bank will find that even more convincing. 
Not sure the AML-laws have gone that far yet (to require photos of what you are spending money on), but he could be proactive. ;)
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:45:00
The EU is feeling how their control over people's savings and payments is slipping out of their hands. Allthough they aren't near the evilness of the state of China, EU still want to be able to tax every EU citizen and decide if they can send money to somebody. Of course under the pretense that these laws prevent money laundering, trafficking, drug trade etc.
Andreas A recently said that the privacy aspect of BTC need to be improved. I agree this should the first priority in coming development.

@_date: 2019-01-07 21:25:08
Not overnight but I agree the sentiment seems more positive lately. I think this change is mainly because many now believe BTC price has hit the bottom and that the price will slowly increase again. 
That said the sentiment change coming from price change should not matter as much as it does. The low fees, increased adoption of LN and multiple improvements to Bitcoin and the network should matter more - but these are harder to understand.
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:44:29
I think the fees will grow until they are painful again. Then developers will have incentive to come up with a LN version 2. And so it will continue.
When the internet was young, many non-believers said we will never be able to send more than text messages over it. Then somebody came up with solutions and you could send small pictures. The non-people said we never would be able to send high res pictures. That was solved and the non-people said we could never stream film over the net. That solved the stupid people said we would never be able to see 4K-resolution over the net. That is solved but still some people are tirelessly narrow-minded. (I did not come up with this story, cudos to Andreas A whom I heard it first from.)
@_date: 2019-01-09 14:14:45
Agree, that was a very good fix!! Good work. :)
Crypto does NOT need governmental rules, it functions very well without them. Fun fact is that governments cannot impose rules on Bitcoin, the underlying math/protocol, the payment functionality nor other out-of-their-control aspects. They can only regulate /some/ third parties that handle the coins. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:11:36
Most people are ignorant until they REALLY need to learn something. At that time, they are very adaptable.
One example is Venezuela, where inflation and state mismanagement have forced many to learn about crypto. You do not want your small savings or pension to go up in smoke in front of your eyes. Most of those people were not crypto-smart, but they had a BIG need and adapted.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:07:56
I upgraded to 16.0 after reading this excellent reminder. :)
@_date: 2019-01-07 11:02:01
IMHO no, Bitcoin came almost too late.
Somebody wiser than me pointed out that the states are taking more and more control over people's payments and activities on internet. China is the most obvious example, but even western states breach people's internet-privacy when hunting for money launderers or terrorists. This shitty behavior just increases over time, as politicians always seem to know better than the man on the street. They think it's their right and purpose to steer people "their way" and limit freedom to choose something else. The banks are sitting in a bog of rules and regulations just to help the politicians and state bureaucrats to implement their truth.
**IF this trend had continued further without a private coins, we would become more and more monitored and state controlled.** (MHO China is slowly making 1984 and Gattaca seems pleasant. Take a look at [ and note they already use it to deny people's travel by high speed rail or airplanes, their children good schools, lower internet speed.) I believe that if Bitcoin would have come later, the states' power might have been too big and never let privacy coins grow.
Because Bitcoin now have evolved and spread enough, politicians and central banks cannot silence nor shut down Bitcoin. We should be very happy about that. :)
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:02:35
Probably the best introduction ever made on why I got into Bitcoin! I will resend this to friends and colleagues, whom a few think I invested in BTC because of speculation. "No!

@_date: 2019-01-07 10:35:40
I agree, some people have a hard time accepting good news. The bigger blocks seems not to be needed for a while, and when there is need I guess we'll see LN version 2. :)

@_date: 2017-09-30 13:22:21
Normal bankers will start hearing about BitCoin so often that they cannot ignore it. First in the press, then when customers want to know how the bank can help them invest in BitCoin (and get a no and a gazillion of advice against doing it), and much later when customers want to make normal payments in BitCoins.
It's only a matter of time, neither the banks nor the governments/central banks can put this genie back into the bottle. :)
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:22:33
I suspect several central banks and governments are saying: 
"BitCoin is coming!"
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:23:24
Inflating their own fiat and taxation are the main tools when a corrupt government tries to get out of the economic mess they created themselves. (IMHO most governments are corrupt, self-protecting and shortsighted, but to a lesser degree than in Venezuela.) 
Ponder this idea: If Venezuelans only used privacy protected krypto, the government would have had a MUCH harder time to ruin the economy. Ergo: the fiat is a really important factor when describing to Venezuela economy.

Nobody in their right mind will take a loan in BitCoin as it's can increase more than normal interests. A few people might until they get burned.
The only BitCoin-"loan" that makes sense is that real BitCoin is transferred to the customer, who then can pay others with it or keep it for investment. I highly doubt banks think this is a great business model for them...
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:12:57
Your thinking is good. I've been thinking that there will be a blow-out when some countries cannot pay off their debts, but in reality the corrupt politicians want to keep their jobs, power etc - so they will just create more money (and come up with new variations of quantitative easing), which in turn will raise inflation.
This ends in destroyed pension savings for the public but the country's debt is worth less. 
I still think some blowout will come and make many fiat currencies worth far less. The positive side is that krypto will benefit...

The easiest way to convert BTC to USD would be to sell it on the exchange and get USD on your exchange account (not bank account). Then YOU send the USD to your bank account. 
The middle way would be to find something you want to buy anyhow (like a game on Steam, voucher on e-bay or pay a friend that you owe money) and pay for it with your BTC.
The hardest way would be to advertise on LocalBitCoin-market and sell it there for USD into your bank account.
The best way would be to keep the BTC for 1-2 years and see what new easier ways are available (to either use it or cash it in). This way the BTC will most likely be worth more...

The price is set by supply and demand - just like your stocks. 
The main drivers are trust and expectancy-of-future-value. 
The trust thing is the same as you trust you normal money (called fiat money also). You trust a dollar is worth almost the same tomorrow - so you "know" you can keep it and use it later also. BitCoin-owners trust a BitCoin will be worth something tomorow too.
The future-value is much much harder to explain. Some of us tech-nerds see all sorts of possible uses in the future. The main use case (meaning normal use) would be to buy a car or your home using BitCoin. 
Last but not least: BitCoin puts your money in YOUR control. No central bank can mess up your country's finances and devalue your fiat money - at your cost. No banks or credit cards can charge you fees for using BitCoin. No government can tax you if a friend sends you BitCoin (because they do not know you received it, they can only see an address on the Blockchain got it). etc etc 
Have a look at some of these for education:

Agree. I started hearing the same quote from Swedish banks more than a year ago; "We think the block chain technology is interesting and has potential future use. But we do not speak about BitCoin (hoping it goes away quietly)."
That translates into; "We think block chain can mean 10% less cost compare to the database ledgers we uphold today. And those of us that understand that BitCoin could replace much of our payment business are very scared (so much that it's not politically correct to discuss what may happen)."

Though I don't trust Forbes to be the pinnacle of good journalism but they may be on to something here. IMHO the so called trade war can influence the BTC price more than expected, perhaps much more. 
How so? China, USA and many other countries want their goods and services to be sold abroad. The politicians and central bankers will push several actions that denotes their currencies, to increase their exports . Those leaders do not care if their citizens savings and future pensions goes to hell, because their imminent problem is growth and debt. They want their economy to expand to counter all sorts of debts, and some debt ridden countries also wants their fiat denounced debts to diminish. 
Ergo; sadly the leaders of many countries will want their fiat to inflate at a steady pace - to protect their view of a "successful economy" (and they seem not to care a dime if that hurts people in other ways). BUT some investors will recognize this and move their money to inflation protected assets. When Bitcoin reaches a go-to-status as inflation protection for investments/savings, I think the price will go up a LOT.

Yes, we should also be talking about the market cap (and not always price per BitCoin). The total value represents in one way how much trust people all over the world has put into BitCoin.

First step is to create an account in an exchange you choose. Investigate their fees, reliability and payment methods. [ I like Kraken.
Then transfer money to that exchange, likely by payment from your bank or debit/credit card.
Wait a few days for the payment to arrive, buy Bitcoin and move them to a wallet of your own.

Good point and hopefully more people will start considering using crypto to take back their right to their money.
I'm actually surprised that Venezuela will be one of the front runners pioneering and showing why crypto is good. Had I guessed two years ago, I'd bet on a much more cash\-less nation; either the African countries that skipped banks and use telecom payments or the Nordic countries \(where it's already hard to find a bank that accept cash\). I missed that the brute reality of hyperinflation is a much stronger driver.

A competent financial professional asking all the right questions.
"What's the new risk free?" at 9:38 is the a question. For private individuals it's gold and BTC, but banks, pension funds and insurance companies are not allowed to invest in the latter.
@_date: 2018-04-30 20:19:33
Yes and there are moral or ethical aspects behind many people sticking to Bitcoin. The individual morals or ethics vary but these makes Bitcoin more than just an investment. IMHO Bitcoin is in many cases a movement towards freedom, away from lechers and corruptness.
The financial markets seldom experienced this "moral fight" and I think it's a bit new to them. To old\-time\-investors/traders an investment is just something you make money on. But to many Bitcoin\-believers this is more than just a financial thing.
@_date: 2018-04-21 13:28:47
I disagree. It shows how a new currency is received by established traders. 
Most people will conclude that the same thing might be happening with crypto. It's explaining why it takes time for crypto to be accepted, in showing that it probably took time for gold to be accepted also. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:31:58
Everything you write in that article is so true. 
One a side note, I think the ideological perspective also should be highlighted. You want to improve crypto exchanges and the surrounding processes for people, even though in some cases it cost you more than you earn. Cudos for that. :\)
 I/we want a working crypto environment, take back ownership of or money and disrupt some really bad structures in governmental steering \(which in turn has led to greater cost for banks who naturally just hand it down to their customers\).

I concur, you ought to read up on it and not take other's advice on this. Make your own opinion.
Unless you can understand the basics of Bitcoin you should stay out of it. On the other hand, if/when you start understand it, you may well want to slowly start invest in it or use it.

@_date: 2018-04-25 16:33:36
I totally agree on the government part, taking back ownership and control of your own money, protecting your savings/pensions from inflation etc.
Disrupting banks is more of a side effect in my mind. They provide a service and profit on it, just as other normal companies profit from you buying from them. In theory you have an option not to use banks \(or telecom companies to give another example\) but few take this choice. 
The problem is that banking is protected by government who cannot take the voter pressure if a banks would fall. If banks would be allowed to go bankrupt and government stopped protecting them, many things would change. Government and the banks are sitting in the same boat, that is a problem.
Rules and regulations from governments or EU also hinder sound competition in the banking sector \- thus indirectly protecting the banks from new competition. It's just too damn expensive to start a new small bank, every bank depends on scale \(so that many customers can pay for the cost of central systems and monitoring processes etc\).
\(But on a side note: I really would like Jamie Dimon, manager of JP Morgan to choke on his own words some months ago about crypto.\)
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:41:02
I agree. 
It would be good for fiat\-people to understand that inflation is eating away their savings and pensions. And inflation will not be less or even the same from today, mainly because of:
1\) Fiat supply is greater than ever because of quantitative easing and governments borrowing money to cover increasing state cost and debts. Sometime the high supply will result in inflation, even though the cycle may take years to show it.
2\) The introduction of krypto currencies with a fixed and flat supply, makes all fiat comparisons different \(meaning inflation measures\). From now on one fiat inflation will not be compared to other inflationary fiats, they can be compared to a krypto that has fixed supply. Even gold supply is not fixed, if the gold price increases a lot of new gold mining will be started \(that were not profitable when the price was lower\).
The sad thing is that the "blow up" you mention will most likely be government on purpose inflating their fiat to lower their state and pensions debts. This way the country's finances will "survive", but those that saved in government bonds, bank accounts or wanted a decent pension will take the cost. Their saved money or pensions will be worth much less than they hoped. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:30:11

And a good thing you highlight "avoiding fiat". Apart from getting out of the banks, you get ownership and control of your own money \(BTC in this case\) and you protect yourself against government induced inflation.

I wish you luck, the fiat market is not for everyone. Some people do not understand it and only listen to what other say. That creates bubbles and inflation over time. The fiat market really ought to be regulated so that only rich people can buy into it \- because they are the only ones that can take those kind of losses.
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:54:21
I'd guess the exchanges and also the banks are busy to first make sure they themselves live up to the PSD2\-directive. They must provide some of their information\-service as open APIs to other business. This takes time, resources and IT\-budget \- all of which are scarce when there are so many other regulatory demands to meet. 
When the above is accomplished, they might turn their eyes towards connecting themselves to other business like you mention.

The crucial quesion is whether "often" is more than 50%. If TA can give a reliable indication that is over 50%, it should pay off to use TA. I'm not sure that the majority of TA-traders make a profit?
@_date: 2019-05-19 10:48:39
IMHO you have got the cause and effect backwards. It's the other way.
Any correlation between production cost and price is because the latter is the "cause" (and mining difficulty/production cost is the "effect")
\- If the price of BTC goes up, so does the mining incentive. If the mining incentive goes up, so does the production cost (because when more miners compete, the difficulty will be increased).
Take a look at the theory of "Stock-versus-inflow". It's based in clean supply-and-demand-theory. :)

Here's my perspective. It took me some months from first reading about Bitcoin to understand it. And then some months to believe in it. When I say BELIEVE I don't mean "the price is going to get higher" but instead "bank the unbanked, disrupt banks and central banks, rights of ownership and security from math and decentralization" are important and likely to happen.
I know a little about about risk management and creating an investment strategy/portfolio. But when I started to really understand and believe what Bitcoins is about, I said "Fuck investment strategies." and set aside an amount I could afford to loose and put it in Bitcoin.
I'd guess **many early "coiners" believe in BTC because of ethical reasons (coupled with security from math and decentralization)**, not financial. That's very different from any other financial bubble I've read about. :)

Try asking around. Any of your friends or aquantancies that know of a seller? Ask money changers or street vendors. I bet there is a closer guy, but you've not found him/her yet.

" ... government transaction is OK to remain hidden, while citizens have to be transparent. Imho it should be the exact opposite."

Agreed and I find it strange that few people think this inflation can happen in their country. There are numerous examples of high inflation and countries on the brink of much-higher-inflation around the world. And yet people do not care or understand that  their savings or pensions are at stake.
"Oh, no! The situation in Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey, India, Iran etc can never happen here. I'm going to vote for somebody that is going to ease my life and screw the country budget and fiat currency even more..." /s

I always upvote the roller-bitcoin and the news included also merited it.

Good to hear. :)
I always thought the bans would push trading out of government's sight and reach. They banned exchanges and trading moved to wechat. The they censor Bitcoin from social media and trading moves to other channels. The rough handling might slow down people's ability to get Bitcoin, but it also educates people how to get it without government monitoring.

IMHO Ron Paul's main messages are the mismanagement of the budget and criticizing the fed's handling of the dollar. He points out that these are hurting the poor and middle class more than they hurt the rich. Those are still VERY relevant though his conclusions are still too early for mainstream to grasp. Wait some years and the mainstream tune might be very different (though some will initially blame banks for higher interest rates, even though those are just consequences and not a root problem).
I agree that his talk about going back to gold standard is not the answer. But it's still just one of his ways to tackle the main problems. We might agree on another of his often repeated suggestion to cut back on US military spending?

Roller-coaster-coin decided wheels are too slow. It changed to rockets cause it's faster to the moon. :)

I agree. For me this looks like the bear market is finally over. 
Fitting, because "Winter is coming." is not relevant anymore.

Spot on!
The merchant bankers are "just" driven by greed, but the central bankers are driven by a religious conviction they know what is best for the economy and every individual.

The satelite BTC-link alone is very good news.
And now it seems to be even better; did I understand correctly that it also suppors lightning payments?

I assume **US'** car and student loans. Yes, I've read those are big risks.

Big news; BTC without "normal" internet connection and private messages without third party. 
I'm glad some things are going the right direction on earth. :)

Though it seems Ms Lagarde is an ethical leader, she is firmly rooted in the old system. IMF keeps repeating that growth is needed above all (and hence they want inflation to fuel it). IMF also has proposed putting fiat currencies onto block chain so states can a) control people's money and b) force inflation when they think it's needed to stimulate growth.
Why? Some parts of the "system" (state debts are huge and ongoing budget deficits makes it worse) is about to break. Old schoolers think more control is needed and fear what they cannot control.
In the interview she again talks about "trust and stability of the system" and those are corroding by the day. Ms Lagarde should be wary of Bitcoin, because it's one of the disruptors to her view of the world.

In the long perspective I think those are the BIG bubbles - but I also think something will burst before they do.

"*The miners are the ones placing (selling) bitcoin into circulation, setting the price accordingly with an aim to profit....*"
IMHO No, the miners are not setting any price! The price is set from supply and demand. One very small part comes from miners production, but the majority is from other selling/buying.

"Bank the unbanked" is Bitcoin's best use-case. This also applies to those that risk loosing their bank account - you only need to get Bitcoins in secret (i.e. not via any bank).
(Store of value is the second use-case and this drives much of the industry.)

With all the concerns voiced in the US, I would have thought the USD would burst before the EUR. But when I think about the problems in the EU, you might be correct.

More people would benefit from your strategy. I encounter so many that react; "I might buy later. It seems I've missed the big increase."
Well, everybody that didn't but the first coins have missed the big increase. What they fail to see is the underlying tech, network and trust -  and continue to miss future increases.
