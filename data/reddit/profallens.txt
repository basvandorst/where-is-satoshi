Can I store btc, eth and litecoin onto a ledger nano s? Does the ledger create unique wallet addresses for each respective coin? Noob question, but thank you!

Hmmm I get that but couldn’t the government put out some sort of ban? Like how China did? 
Edit: Ohh icic. For instance couldn’t the U.S government take out exchanges and track down people who signed up via their ssn and ban it indefintely? Or attempt to? or is that not plausible

But just because banks are owned by the government, you lean towards crypto? What’s so wrong about banks and governments that led you to your decision?
