Some altcoins have been rocking 30 second blocks for quite some time without issues.  I can see how fast blocks would have a negative impact through orphans on a proof of work chain, loss for miners computing irrelevant blocks.  Though on a proof of stake chain, fast blocks may make sense.  Hyper and Bitswift both do proof of stake and 30 second blocks.

yes sir, I know what you are saying.  By modifying it, you are essentially turning it into a standard payments network.  as it is.. its a lvtn.  I think there is more value in moving large sums, and a willingness to pay the fee for that large sum, than in modifying the protocol to accommodate more transactions with no or little fees.

I agree. At the very minimum Bitcoin will remain a large value transfer network.

There are altcoins such as Litecoin with 2.5 minute block speed, and hyper, bitswift with block speeds of 30 seconds.  Block speed + Block Size = total transaction bandwidth.  Blockchain with 30 second blocks support roughly 20 times the transaction bandwidth as Bitcoin.  For Bitcoin to implement such fast blocks it would likely need a mining algo change, prob move to proof of stake all together as mining blocks that fast will leave tons of consistent orphans = lots of wasted work in a proof of work scenario.

million dollar question .. well maybe a couple 1000 dollar question depending on price fluctuations
