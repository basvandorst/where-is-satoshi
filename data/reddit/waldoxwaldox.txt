maybe this craig character is a way for government to discredit bitcoin and its creator by using an imposter
most people blindly listen to the mainstream media and would never visit bitcoin forums to read opposing opinions. if the media can associate bitcoin's creator with a really dark past that it creates then it will help marginalize bitcoin.

who is to gain in mt gox's collapse
1) mark karpeles - run off with bitcoins
2) us govt - destabilize and kill bitcoins to protect their world reserve currency, letting print near limitless money and making the world eat the inflation, in the process stealing trillions of value to support their worldwide armed presence
3)competitors to mt gox
4) hackers or employees

Theory: What if central bankers are funding both sides of the blockchain size argument to centralize bitcoin thru development 
Thinking as if i was a central banker who wants bitcoin to fail or control bitcoin. One way to harm bitcoin would be to create chaos in bitcoin core development so that it cannot improve technologically. you would probably need to control only a few core developers so bitcoin development will be locked. that is why you see spamming in dev mailing list and non-productive arguments between developers to slow development down and create a barrier to entry. next i would spam the block chain to sell the idea to the general public and miners that we need to increase the blockchain limit ASAP. this costs a trivial amount of money. next offer a great harmless and logical solution with fewer more centralized developers on bank's payrole. ie. bitcoin classic/xt/etc... increasing the blockchain faster than what technology can handle can also centralized the miners which would benefit the bankers too.

i think enabling seg wit will increase bitcoin price by allowing more transactions. use a thought experiment. on the extreme side, say it takes .1 bitcoin to send any transaction. Thus the price of 1 bitcoin will be 10x the cost of a transaction. in the developed world one electronic transaction costs say $2 at a bank. so for bitcoin to have a healthy use the price of a bitcoin will be around $20, any higher transaction price then you will be paying higher transaction fee and traditional banking would be cheaper to send money. 
now if bitcoin transaction costs go down to 0.0000001 then there is room for bitcoin to take over traditional bank transfers. and can support a higher bitcoin price before the average transaction costs approach traditional bank transfer costs.

if your the central bank you print the money out of thin air.. so you dont really run out of money.. what you will do is transfering value from your currency to bitcoin miners/bitcoin network... one transaction fee at a time. they can theoretically DOS bitcoin transactions.. by say maxing out the 1mb limit with all spam transactions paying for example .01 btc transaction fee and crowding out transactions with smaller 0.0001 fees. because they create the currency they can do this indefinitely with any blockchain size, 1-&gt;8+mb

another action by the government to destabalize bitcoin as a

the maximum storage space you would need be able to track every satoshi ever
created would be 2100000000000000 satoshis x 50 bytes = 95496 Tera Bytes (50 bytes is only an estimate)
its within the realm of current technology to track every satoshi if we wanted to
