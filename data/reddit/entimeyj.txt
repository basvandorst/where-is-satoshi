My advice : 
Send that 1 bitcoin to a paper waller and store it in your google drive/dropbox
Comeback years later when you retire
Enjoy money and bitchs when you're 50/60 years old !

China represents 25%-30% from Crypto capitalisation 
Lets assume, only 18% of that represents Chinese citizens who will withdraw their fund (others may prefer to keep crypto and send it to other exchanges) 
This means from today to end of september (end of october for Huobi and Okcoin) 18% of money will be exiting the crypto economy gradually wich will impact the price of course.

how would china miners pays their bills if they can't convert part of their bitcoin to fiat ? (both exchange and OTC trading is banned in china now). 
monthly electricity bills reach a couple million dollars for the biggest pools

if they're based on china, they pay their suppliers in local currency (Chinese yuan)....
no other exchanges than chinese ones offer yuan/Crypto pairs
