Too bad verification is taking ages.  Like everyone else.

Sounds like she doesn't want to share in the future with you bro, no hodl on that one.

Goddamit Gemini, verify me already.  Gdax/CBs volatility in even staying up lately has been pathetic.

Dude people delete and create accts all the time - this is reddit not some forum.  I've been here since day one but my "2 years" on this acct doesn't reflect that and this one will be dumped in 2.5k karma like the rest of em.  This is commonplace usage of reddit.

I'm so glad I was never able to get an account activated on there in the first place.  The whole process was such a shitshow (actually *still* waiting for them to actually acknowledge the ticket for my account closure).

Ive been using my most hated banking institution for all my fiat-BTC moves.  Still waiting for them to throw a bitch fit so I can dump their asses.

Why do you think this is comparable.  People "saying things" is not the answer I'm looking for btw.

I was under the impression that the US govt doesn't consider BTC to be currency.

I wanted to avoid this pitfall and bought some goods over the weekend, and bought back my position at a lower price with the mini-dip earlier today.  Good times.

This guy is a bookies dream lol.

I think people need to talk more about this one.  What are the factors for why?  New alt takes over?  Loss of confidence?  Global economic collapse?  Asteroid?

I meant more in general but I'd like your take on it too.

You are on reddit.
