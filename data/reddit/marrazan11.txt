And when Duber tokens become too expensive people will use Duber2.0. Bitcoin is literally in a world of its own and the rest are just blockchains looking for a reason to exist.﻿

 The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.
