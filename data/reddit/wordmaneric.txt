The reason that your generation is predicted to be worse off than your parents is that the 1% are waging a war against the 99%, and the 99% are not doing enough to stop it.
Do you believe that politicians want to take away social security and other benefits from future generations because they dislike young people?  No, they want to do this because it will transfer wealth to their friends on Wall Street. It is a money grab.
You make the situation out to be intergenerational warfare, but there is no such thing. There is only class warfare. And although cryptocurrencies can be a disruptive force against the 1%, the overall effect of the disruption will probably not be very large. Many people in the 1% will learn to take advantage of what cyptocurrencies have to offer. This will make them even more powerful.
If you want the establishment to get their comeuppance, then you are going to need more than bitcoin. You are going to need to become more aware of the class warfare that is being waged against the 99%, and you will need to learn to assert your political power in order to put a stop to it.

No, there are not two bitcoins. There is only one bitcoin, and it is called bitcoin, not bitcoin core. And it came first.

No, the fee setting on the Ledger will have no effect, because it only affects transactions that are sent *from* the Ledger.  
You're probably better off paying the transaction fees in order to move your coins rather than trying to import the Exodus seed into the Ledger.  Here's why:
1) Presumably, you bought the Ledger because it provides better security than Exodus. But if your Exodus seed has ever been compromised, then importing it will leave your Ledger just as vulnerable as Exodus.
2) Exodus and Ledger probably have different derivation paths, which would make a migration complicated.

The reason that bitcoin is so valuable is that the supply is limited and the demand is continually increasing. This is why the price is going up, and this is why people buy and hold. Yes, the fees can make it painful to do transactions; this is yet another reason why people simply hold. Hopefully, in the future there will be second layer advancements that cause the fees to come down.

In my opinion, neither the blockchain web wallet nor Coinbase is a good choice.  I don't oppose them because I think they will steal your segwit2X coins; I oppose them because they are supporters of the closed-door NYA "agreement" that brought us here to this unnecessary hardfork. The supporters of segwit2x are claiming that it's an upgrade, but in fact it's a downgrade (note that the segwit2x code is based on bitcoin core 0.14, rather than the current 0.15.0.1). Their intention is to replace bitcoin with segwit2x, and to put a stop to the progress that the core developers have given us in the past and plan to give us in the future. 
You could create a paper wallet. A paper wallet, if created properly, is extremely secure. Or you could purchase a hardware wallet, assuming that your bitcoin investment is large enough to warrant such a purchase. 
If you must choose between blockchain and Coinbase, then I would choose the one whose statement about the fork you found most reassuring.

How much electricity do they use? What about the thousands of bank branches that serve people around the world? How much electricity do they use?

If there is a fork in November, then do not buy any more BTC from Coinbase until you can verify that it's the BTC that you want (which I am assuming is NOT 2X). The point is that you do NOT want to send 2X to the same wallet in which you are keeping BTC, because then you cannot keep track of what you have.

Nothing good can come from sending 2X to a wallet in which you are holding BTC. Mixing them would make it more difficult to send them to different wallets, and therefore you would give up control. You would make it more difficult to sell what you want to sell, if you ever decide to sell.

First you say something ridiculous ("it was always worthless"), then ask where its value comes from, and compare it to a pyramid scheme, as if you have no idea about its legitimacy. So then I tell you why it's legitimate, and your reply is that I'm missing the point?  I'm not missing the point. You have no point, or at least not a very coherent one. And no, I don't see the similarities to a pyramid scheme, and neither do you, because there aren't any.

This situation is different, and it's not a "win win." Bitcoin Cash had replay protection, making it easy for us to split our BTC into BTC and BCH. 2X is not going to have replay protection. It's going to be very difficult for us to split our coins. 
Most of the companies who are supporting 2X are owned by DCG. That is not a coincidence. The goal here is a corporate takeover of Bitcoin, and a replacement of the core developers. 
You like segwit? You can thank the core developers for that, but if 2X succeeds in replacing bitcoin, then don't expect any more improvements, because the core developers will be gone.
@_date: 2017-09-25 17:55:43
Because the Bitcoin Cash fork had replay protection, it was relatively easy to split your bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (i.e., send them to different wallets). However, the B2X fork is NOT expected to have replay protection. Therefore, you are taking a much bigger risk if you try to split your coins. It is probably not worth the risk unless you know exactly what you are doing. Be careful.

1) Bitcoin has value because its transactions are uncensorable, meaning that no form of authority can dictate which transactions should and should not happen. This is a feature that the dollar and other currencies simply do not have. For example, in 2010, the US Government pressured VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, Bank of America, and Western Union to stop processing donations of US dollars to Wikileaks. But thanks to bitcoin, Americans still had a way to donate money to Wikileaks. 2) Bitcoin is extremely secure. A bitcoin transaction is stored on the blockchain, which is replicated by thousands of nodes run by individuals all over the world. Presumably, it is easier to hack the computer system of a bank than it is to simultaneously hack thousands of nodes all over the world, which arguably makes bitcoin more secure than money stored in a bank (assuming that the bitcoin owner properly stores his private keys).  3) Bitcoin provides more anonymity than traditional currencies. Although not as anonymous as cash, a bitcoin transaction is more anonymous than any debit card or credit card transaction, and some people place a value on that. 4) Bitcoin's source code is constantly being improved by the core developers. In 2017 we got Segwit, and in 2018 we can expect Schnorr Signatures to batch inputs together, further reducing the size of transactions and increasing the efficiency of the blockchain. We can also look forward to the lightning network, which will allow bitcoin to scale so that it can compete with VISA as an extremely fast payment system.
These are some of the things that give bitcoin value. What's the dollar value on them?  I don't know.  It's not up to me to decide. It's up to the market.

Didn't you read that article before you linked to it? Go back and read it. Like the first sentence says, we already have net neutrality. And it is already in "full force."
There is some truth to what the article says about Netflix and Amazon benefiting from the current situation. But the biggest problem here is not what Netflix and Amazon are getting away with, it is what the ISPs are getting away with. Go back and read the article again. It says that the ISPs don't have any competition, and therefore they have too much power. And they will have even more power if the Trump administration gets rid of net neutrality.
Imagine if your phone company could intentionally interfere with your calls. Imagine them blocking your calls to your local pizza restaurant, because Pizza Hut and Papa Johns were *paying them* to block those calls.

Bread and Electrum are both very good wallets. Yes, you are always in control as long as you (and only you) have your seed. The safest non-hardware wallet would be a paper wallet, but only if you create and print the paper wallet offline, delete your browser history, and restart before going back online. And of course, a paper wallet has one major disadvantage: You can't ever spend from it, so you'd have to import or sweep it into another wallet at some point.

The problem is that there is more than one "market." There are users and miners, and their interests don't necessarily align. If miners choose to mine B2X rather than BTC, and there is no replay protection, then SPV wallets could switch from BTC to B2X and users wouldn't even know about it. IMHO, the market can't decide anything if the users don't even know which chain their wallets are on.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice, **voter fraud**, which is committed by individual voters, is [not a widespread problem](  However, dishonest politicians often misrepresent voter fraud as a widespread problem because it gives them a pretext for instituting harsh voter ID laws.

On the other hand, **election fraud**, which is committed by political operatives and party officials of both major parties, is a serious issue and a dangerous threat to democracy.

The pro-2x movement is led by the CEOs of very important companies such as Coinbase, Bitpay, and Shapeshift. These are very serious people. Very serious indeed!

These are people who have been known to wear camouflage hats and add “NO2X” to their twitter names.
Here is my summary of what the article doesn’t say:
Proponents of 2X are demanding that we get bigger blocks NOW, despite the fact that we still haven’t fully reaped the benefits of segwit.
