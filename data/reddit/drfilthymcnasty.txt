Needs more pain.

I’m counting on it ��. If it goes down I will probably just buy more.

Yeah, but our video games are cheaper :/

No clue on Bitconnect, but it seems like the market is wacky lately. Lots of alts coming in strong while bitcoin is pulling back some. Then the founder of lightcoin announces he sold all his lightcoin.

Ugh I just sold some last night to by iota, which then went down. Oh well. Hodl

Yes but also look into the other altcoins. Ethereum and lightcoin are also big cryptos that are doing well and somewhere in the altcoins is the next big thing. Try to diversify if possible.

I feel like we should all be asking this. This just seems all too easy. I’m pinching myself. . . ouch 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:37:37
And there are probably some girls too!!!!!!!

Lol, it took like a week to go from 8 to 9? I almost want it to slow down. I’ve never seen my money grow this easily...it feels too good to be true.

I’m not a girl. But good to know your guys are getting in on this shit ������✌️��
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:53:22
What if it’s both?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:32:30
Oh it’s bubbly for sure, but I think it’s getting harder and harder to deny blockchain is here to stay, and will most likely take over. The real question is what cryptos will come out on top.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:13:55
Totally but I appreciate different opinions. Didn’t plan on cashing out anytime soon so I am gonna ride this wave for a while.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:00:47
I’ve been lurking for about a year and finally took the plunge and bought some this past week. I feel like I’m soo late to the game and I bought too high. What do you guys think? Will this growth continue or do you think we might see a crash pretty soon?

I’m a huge krypto proponent and bitcoin seems like a great way to store wealth but I’m skeptical of using it like an everyday currency. So if I’m wrong let me know.
