There are major non-consensus features in 0.13. Just no consensus changes.  
@_date: 2016-08-22 13:37:51
Probably, but why not just use 24? If you're already writing it down, might as well. Especially for Trezor recovery which is more vulnerable than some other devices like Nano S(you have to enter in words on computer).

You've already got some good answers, but I might want to mention one more.
In the near future once Segwit is activated, Schnorr signature aggregation will hopefully be deployed, which is a method for doing CoinJoin(or even just sweeping your own utxos) that combines all the signatures in a transaction to a single signature to be stored/validated. This would incentivize CoinJoins economically, since transactions would be moderately cheaper if you wait a bit and join with others. Combined with something like Coinshuffle++, we might finally see some widespread usage.  
That's not enough, but it's a start.  
For now you can play with [Elements Alpha]( which uses Confidential Transactions which hides the amounts. If we ever switch over to CT on Bitcoin, then the advantages of CoinJoin are even larger.

If you drop the "fast sync" part of MW you can easily do it with scripting.  
CT-OWAS is not a bad deal. 
Or you can have fast sync with scripting, and you get some sort of SPV mode, which might make sense for a federated chain.

1) zeroes are cool, otherwise we'd look at ffffffffffffffffffffffff (seriously though, no)
2) if you reorder the transactions(in general) that will change the merkle tree, which changes the merkle root, which changes the block hash. Generally speaking not conflicting is done via nonce, extranonce, and other data since rebuilding the merkle tree is more expensive.

kind of older, but here is a paper with an argument why PoS is fundamentally incompatible with distributed consensus: 
New versions of PoS side-step this by requiring that the user be around during system setup or trust a friend to get the current state of the ledger, such as Tendermint, Casper(ETH's version). This is strictly weaker than Bitcoin's trust model.

The security model posited is that all you need to do is download the 30Gb(B?) of data and get the full node security.  
It's more subtle than that, because you're still losing some information. For example, there could be two parallel histories in the blockchain, and you as a new user would only know if a peer told you about the other one. I haven't figured out what should be done in that case exactly, but I'm pretty sure that there's a way of dealing with it and it would become obvious once you've caught up to near the tip if there are many conflicting transactions in the full blocks you are downloading.  
A malicious miner could also add duplicates of transactions, and be able to lie about their true age making them look newer, at least to new nodes.  
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:22:09
It's a hybrid model, where the functionaries slowly cede power to miners as merge-mining share rises closer to Bitcoin hashpower.  
It's a pretty decent solution, imo. I think a federated peg is enough for what most people want anyways.
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:59:54
Not automatically but you can unlock it to "take it back" after a bit(script might be wrong, I'm not a script expert, but this is the idea):


    &lt;bob_pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY  
ELSE  
    &lt;amount of time to wait&gt; OP_CSV &lt;alice_pubkey&gt; OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY    
The receiver can spent it at any point, but after &lt;amount of time to wait&gt; you can just take it back by spending it to your wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:13:57
You might have had bad connectivity to the p2p network.  
I use a wallet with a co-signing service, and that service propagates the transaction through its full nodes, which seems to help in this respect.

I guarantee you it doesn't. Vitalik is the latest proponent of the "fix" of phoning a friend. The last time I attempted to read his scribblings he was defending the notion that all nodes must have the ledger state from less than a year ago to not need to "phone a friend".

After having and using both, the big remaining plus for a Trezor is its more mature application software ecosystem(and the ability to add password on top of seed). It's been around longer, and has stuff like password managers. Unfortunately at least a few apps aren't open source, or are stuck on only Chrome apps (for example the password manager is closed-source Chrome app, so you can't install it yourself so it doesn't auto-update, and there is no support for Android/etc. I specifically asked for help on these points, and was told I was out of luck). The Ledger BOLOS ecosystem is just getting started, but will see updates quite soon, and I've been assured the supported apps will be open source from the start.   
I disagree with the other comment, in that the PIN for me takes just as long on Trezor. The shuffling PIN has to be looked at and analyzed, while the on-screen PIN can just be punched in. You can also do a complete recovery on-device, which is quite cool.
If you have to choose one, I'd get the Nano S. I'd send you one of my extra Trezors but I don't trust the chip to fully wipe secrets since it's not smart card based ;P

Or validate ALL transactions?
You know full well that Bitcoin doesn't work that way. Unfortunately it's a dichotomy: Either validate all or none.
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:21:30
fwiw I don't think the fee-splitting, as a purely optional feature, is such a terrible idea. I as a user may want to "vote" to keep the chain moving forward with his wallet. Right now the only way to do this(I think) is to nLockTime more OP_TRUE outputs in the future.  
It's true though people can simply side-step it, and it's cheaper to do so.
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:53:40
Not updating is perfectly valid. You can run fairly ancient versions of Core and sync just fine. The consensus rules have never changed in a backwards-incompatible way. (there might be security fixes required though)
@_date: 2016-08-01 14:16:03
I actually implemented this feature in bitcoin-cli. It's called "importprunedfunds" and "removeprunedfunds".  
To use it you need to import the private key without rescanning, get the raw transaction string for the funds you're importing, then get your hands on the results of [gettxoutproof]( for that transactions. Then your wallet will have those funds. Just make sure you don't import already-spent funds.

My point(which was addressed by andytoshi below) was that only nodes online would reject these. New nodes would follow and be forked off.

@_date: 2016-08-08 17:41:47
Ok, your conclusion holds provided the two chains are valid. A chain may have invalid history, and new nodes would never know.  
I don't think this can be fundamentally fixed.  
At this point I think people can use this mode to quickly sync up to the last few months of blocks, know that there is at least no inflation on this chain(even without seeing amounts), then if they please, fully sync in the background.

CT rangeproofs are very large at ~2.5KB which is problematic for scaling. They are live in [Elements Alpha]( the testnet sidechain.
There has been some work to shrink the size of those proofs, but AFAIK a 25% savings is the state of the art, which isn't nothing, but also not a panacea. 
However they are a good match for federated sidechains where there is no centralization pressure in block-making, like in Alpha, and [Liquid](

The specific key is supposedly wumpus' release signing key.
What I did was verify that this key was actually signed by wumpus' personal key. Lucky for me I have signed his personal key at a previous meetup, so I can be sure that outside of theft of key that is him. Clearly not everyone can do this and this doesn't scale, so simply having his personal key ahead of time and comparing with others would be a good start.

In reality you should put forth the effort in proportion with how much you hold.  
In general though, there's no need to use a web-wallet of any sort. It's much safer to just use a desktop/Android/iOS wallet, especially with the 2FA options available today. I use [GreenBits]( (disclaimer: my company develops this wallet) for walk-around money since it has 2FA and has a long track record of security.   
If it's a lot of money, you may want to invest in a hardware wallet like [Ledger Nano S]( There are even more secure setups, but those take time, care, and knowledge to get right.

&lt;andytoshi&gt; this is the subset-sum problem which is NP-hard in general, but might not be for many specific cases  
&lt;andytoshi&gt; having said that, the knowers of specific k*G values can interact to combine their transactions, which would make this much harder. an implementation of mimblewimble should maybe have network messages for doing this  
&lt;andytoshi&gt; err, not combine transactions, just combine their k*G values. the actual transactions don't need to be involved at all  
&lt;andytoshi&gt; ah, there's a simple fix, publish k1*G and k2, sign with k1*G but make the transaction excess be (k1 + k2)*G

The amount of capital required in a super hub is the amount required to set up the in/out channels. It doesn't make economic sense unless people are doing tons of direct business with the hub itself.  
ie, BitPay might run a super hub, because they actually get paid, and then pay their supply chain contractors, etc.  
What they *won't* do is run a super hub to have Alice pay Bob, because Alice will just open a channel to pay Bob for cheaper/free transactions. Also, since people will preferentially route through nodes with more uptime, the DoS risk for hubs gets quite high.

I believe those alerts are still live. The alerts being removed are for partition alerts, where you are seeing blocks either way too slow or very rapidly, suggesting you are partitioned, but they misfire all the time during normal conditions.

It only depends on how much the attacker is willing to jam up stuff with really high fee transactions. To penalize your cheating counter-party, all you have to do is make it into the top 4 megaweight of the mempool. Luckily you can also use the cheater's money to pay for it!

Fees in LN are only for routing through people in the network.
For example, Alice pays Charlie through Bob.
Bob will charge a small flat fee(few satoshis?) plus a % of the transaction(.15%? it's something really small), to offset the risk of a timeout locking up funds for a bit.
The fees will be a few orders of magnitude cheaper than on-chain, since you're really only paying for the lock-up risk.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:16:32
Highly unlikely since they'd have to both be ready at the same exact time ecosystem-wide, and have consensus. Joining them kind of confuses the issue, maybe.

Eh, not sure I see a huge financial motivation here, especially if software just says "no" to "ridiculous fees", and developers can raise the defaults in response for example. The privacy aspect seems more interesting to me though. Thanks for the thoughts.

Afaict he's correct but I'm not an expert. The construction of the onion routing only limits identifying routes from within just that data. Side channels exist, just like with Tor, though possibly worse due to the points he raised.
Edit: not sure what "appropriate" in the title is asking. It's clearly worse to just tell everyone in the path you are paying. Like most bitcoin tech, take the privacy claims with a grain of salt.

Venmoish payments?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:01:07
I buy this attack in a limited time scope. It costs money to shape the routes(and keep them shaped). The upperbound would be about 1 on-chain transaction worth of fees, and any reasonable software would simply reject the payment even a couple orders of magnitude lower.
Ignoring the UX, if we're going one step further, you may want to have you wallet estimate over time how much it has cost to route to entities you know. If it's above some multiple you've seen historically, this may be cause for exceptional behavior: defer payment until channels are more balanced, setup a new direct channel (with the associated payment), or something else.

@_date: 2018-01-10 17:39:54
I was referring specifically to LN routing fees.
I just don't think the attack is a slam dunk winner for the attacker unless the sender is completely price insensitive, doesn't opt to use a substitute good(on-chain, open a new channel directly) and holds huge time preferences.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:48:15
this video goes into it, but a lot of the lessons learned are directly applicable to any chain that has Schnorr signatures, which can be softforked into Bitcoin easily at some point thanks to Segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:37:15
For refilling a channel, you can also simply spend the channel utxo, include more funds at the same time, and re-establish the channel again, right?
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:46:53
Well, no. The user can set up a channel opportunistically, at any point, during any on-chain spend. You'll pay for the additional 30 bytes in the transaction, and have a channel ready-made the next time you want to transact. If you have small time preferences, this results in something like 27 cents, even under today's crazy congestion. Really the only reason to take down a channel is to make an on-chain payment for whatever reason(so you're already spending those bytes) or non-cooperative channel partner.
Have you actually tried making payments using LN on testnet? Even with super raw tools I was using, it ended up being quite transparent after setup. I actually *forgot* the fact that I was paying through multiple hops after I ended up checking out more stores and made repeated successful payments in under a second.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:51:48
Oh this is reddit screwing up replies on mobile. This was a response to someone
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:22:22
I suppose this attack makes the most sense wrt de-anon of payments? Deplete your target's other routing paths, then listen for payments that can only be from the target?
One counter-measure, I believe that is done in most software, should be to charge more when depletion of a channel is getting close. Could be non-linear even.
edit(sniping your response elsewhere):


I see now. Looks like the fee forumula would have to be set up in advance?
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:05:22
The risks here are:
1) You set up a channel, and your counter-party stops responding, making you pay for the channel breakdown with a relatively expensive contract  
2) You set up a channel, and while routing, someone in the chain stops responding(not counter-party). That amount of money will be "frozen" until their timeout hits, and you and your counter-party revert it and continue on as before. Smaller payments at a time help with this obviously.  
3) Your counter-party tries to cheat by replaying an old channel state. You, or a trustless watchtower, mechanically detects this cheating and takes *all* the channel funds.

Indeed. Evil soft-forks are evil. We'd have to hardfork a new PoW if miners start doing those sorts of things, and make the threat explicit. jtimon talks a bit about it here: 
For clarity, I'm arguing about "non-evil" hard and soft forks. "Disagree with" forks :)  Maybe my examples shouldn't be so loopy. Noted for future discussions. Sometimes I like the absurd a bit too much.


Maybe I'm an idealist but that goes further and further away from distributed consensus and to "phone a friend" consensus, ala Ethereum. If a semi-controversial hardfork happens once, Bitcoin probably survives just fine. But if it's regular, I'm simply dumping and walking away because it will devolve into a centralized payment rail controlled by those doing the forking.

1) Too complicated! Too useless! Complete flop like original payment channels!  
2) It'll be so damned successful no one will ever use the blockchain ever! Miners will starve on the streets!  
My realistic hope is for somewhere in the middle of those two.

The idea is that in the average case while you may end up sending more in total, it will be "smoothed out" so when "real" blocks are found you have very little to propagate. Block validation and propagation is much more important than ~1.5 bandwidth growth for miners, at least for now.  
Here's the more commonly-known work on the concept:

@_date: 2015-12-30 18:51:37
Off-chain you basically "burn" the older transaction by exchanging the private key for it after updating it with a new version of the transaction. If someone tries to post an old version to the blockchain, you take all their money. That way you can pay back and forth, bi-directionally.  
That is just person to person. Next you can send multi-hop payments using more tricks. So as long as the network is connected to each other, and there is liquidity along some path, you can pay anyone cheaply, and fast.

The real issue is that technical decisions are being made in order to preserve zero conf, rather than things such as price signaling, and decentralization metrics.

A soft-fork is just a restriction on the set of valid transactions/blocks, right? So 51%+ can over time censor all transactions of a certain type. For example, OP_CLTV is being rolled out now by a majority of miners, although they're going for 95% for safety reasons.

I think his question was more "why aren't people validating" rather than Core per-se. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:00:04


I find it difficult to discuss when you're conflating the abilities of bitcoinj style SPV nodes and validating nodes. A non-updated node in the presence of non-malicious softforks can ensure that you have not accepted a transaction with the same utxo as a previously included transaction. SPV is strictly inferior to this.  
It's simply false to assert that pre-CLTV nodes and bitcoinj have the same security model. They still 100% validate the chain according to their ruleset. They can still even accept payments safely within that chain! It's not even close. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 15:22:38


There are a number of upgrades being worked on.   
Weak blocks and IBLT:  
  
This improves at least the average/best case scenario, if not worst-case. This could help dissipate some of the centralization pressure currently in mining in a non-adversarial setting.  
There is also some work to decouple mining rewards with policy(what you include in blocks). This means that every miner can decide what goes into a block while still getting reduced variance. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 13:30:10
To be clear, he capped signature operations and signature hashing. That's more important than size, which today is an isStandard rule in Core.  
Long-term we need a validation cost metric, not ad-hoc constraints like we have in Core/XT.

The worst case you're detailing(which is quite possible depending on regulations) means we will have disjoint networks. Which is ok. Just less useful than a holistic web.
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:57:54
Once a consensus library is teased out, we should see a lot more alternative clients that have virtually no extra risk of accidentally forking. Each release is refactoring this code a bit more.  
Until then we are kind of stuck on one repo.  
Of course, random people trying to change consensus rules can never be "decentralized" or "fixed". It's what makes consensus hard.
@_date: 2015-12-21 12:48:59
He didn't credit the primary source for his idea. It's like writing a paper on selfish mining itself and not crediting Gun Sirer(if Sirer hadn't published a formal paper but had public e-mails back and forth with you where Sirer repeatedly corrected your misunderstandings).

In the worst case, we can not assume that. If it's profitable for a large miner to not share before he finds a block, he has no real incentive to do so aside from altruism.  
The average case we can probably improve, yes. People are working on that right now.

@_date: 2015-06-30 22:44:01
I'm talking about FSS-RBF as well.  
Since we have no definition of what is change address, you can't decrement any previous outputs. Only way to bump fee is to add another UTXO.  
CPFP needs a whole additional transaction, which is obviously even more costly.  
In terms of cost:  
RBF &lt; FSS-RBF &lt; CPFP
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:11:15
No one outside of you and the other party know which output is "change".  
To bump a fee to replace a one-input two-output transaction, it will have to take another input.  
*now wondering how successive bumps work... unsure if additional inputs are needed each time*
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:33:43


Which if miners are doing their job in the new ruleset it will not happen. You will have to wait for confirmations, which is recommended anyways. If you're saying we need to hard-fork to maintain 0-conf security we're just not going to agree on a premise here and that's ok. As long as we understand the arguments in good faith.


Same with the newest version of the software. You can not prove that you are running the same code as miners. All you can prove is that the current longest valid chain has included your transaction. That is *not* SPV as you describe it.

At the extreme I'm worried about the lack of education/participation that could lead to systematic risk. If you are literally the only person who isn't a large exchange running a full node, your money can get inflated by proxy, or censored easily.  
A large economic fraction needs to be participating in full consensus to keep players honest. I have no idea if Gavin's 20MB++ fork would allow this, which is why I'm firmly against it.

From this small sampling I'm not going to bother to fisking this whole thing. Utterly ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:05:46
But it wouldn't be. It would be a (poorly split) separate currency. And maybe with another softfork they could be fairly cleanly split.   
It could run just fine indefinitely. (unless 25% of the 75% split off and DoS the smaller chain)
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:16:03
Also, FWIW, recent events have shown me that Gavin is acting in bad faith.

It's designed as a soft fork.  
Imagine it somewhat like a tighter sidechain. A sidechain where miners(who opt-in) will validate what happens on the sidechain, while those who don't care don't know anything about it.

Hmm? I didn't write any specific dates.  


True, which is why I'm a little baffled that people are in such a hurry. I have yet to see a business plan that makes sense that would distinguish the two scenarios, so why even bother hard forking to do so if it (could) simply centralizes Bitcoin? Increasing block size is a decentralization downer, period. We should be aiming for a real tradeoff here.  
Hence my narrative: 130MB at least has a *sales pitch*.

Sounds like you want to do something like:   
Simply forgetting about old UTXOs and then requiring ancient ones to bring proofs of existence seems to do the trick.  
You can read that thread to get some ideas. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:24:38
Yeah for small amounts off-chain works just fine. Larger amounts clearly on-chain is best. Still, for those amounts you can just wait a few blocks. Right now if you are ok waiting 25 blocks you pay something like $0.002, which means 10x would be 2 cents. That is still extremely competitive.    
Hopefully in future we have better middle ground like Lightning Networks and possibly undiscovered future methods(although it's really hard to imagine gaining much over that... 2 transactions on-chain get you near infinite off-chain secure ones).
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:18:14

@_date: 2015-12-23 15:04:58
This is by far the simplest explanation. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:59:15
In the non-cooperating case, orphan risk fee rates don't provide hashing security.  
These data-sharing/cooperation layers on top would make that not true in the "typical" case, assuming miners are willing to share transactions, and follow along this protocol, or others based on weakblocks/IBLT/whatever. These are fine points that can be debated and modeled, but OP's interpretation appears to be a willful mis-reading of the quote. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 15:37:52


You may actually want to take your own advice and read how the blockchain stops double-spending. Nothing to do with this conversation. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:42:40


Less PoW.  
My example was silly to be obviously something I'm against. The story of me having to sift through the new ruleset, decide if it's for me, then decide if the old chain is just so weak that I have to accept the new one, is still there. In reality I have no idea how a schism hardfork would go down, and I don't want to find out.  


To each his own, but all I want is to make sure my transactions are included in blocks and stay that way. Two major coins using the same PoW function is  a recipe for instability in hashrate and reorgs.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:19:12
I need to read closer :)  
It's a good idea though.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:32:07
I'm sure there is some socking, as I see plenty of fresh accounts, but I don't think overwhelming.  
More annoying is the "downvote anything I don't like" behavior.
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:56:23
Also not a fan of "voting", since mining is so broken now.  
If mining wasn't so broken my hair wouldn't be nearly as on fire against it.
@_date: 2015-12-26 20:49:24
This is why the soft fork rules won't be enforced until 95%+ of mining power supports it. Makes long forks very unlikely. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:53:20
I'm talking about Gavin's specific proposal.  
20MB++ blocks, without anything close to developer consensus. 4-8MB I'd probably be ok with, but only as an agreement that it's kicking the can down the road. Seems as though Gavin has reneged on that though, and is back to 20MB++(as per e-mail to dev list that kicked off the storm). He also strangely didn't back off even thought his 20MB number was simply wrong.  
If you haven't read a single good argument against it, you are probably not reading the developer mailing list, or following Basically just reading Maxwell(nullc)'s posts would be the best thing.   
I'd rather not find links all day for you, but here's a pretty good thread touching on some of it: 
Also:  for arguments from a non-core dev.
@_date: 2015-06-23 19:48:49
Ok, but that's impossible. We don't know when orphans were created. All we know is the cumulative work behind a chain.  
If we want to optimize for it, we should just make block times an average of 30 minutes. Would be quite safe ;)
@_date: 2015-06-01 17:36:33
You don't. But having 5/6 of your technical experts quit at once might be telling you something. (I don't know what other core devs would plan to do, but I imagine they aren't interested in just another payment rail on the internet) 
And this bizarre downvoting of Facts I Don't Like is just ridiculous. (not blaming you)
@_date: 2015-06-22 12:24:27


You have no idea if that's true. If mining becomes captured by regulatory agencies it could very well be the end of decentralized Bitcoin even if we want to soft fork. The "freedom" soft fork could be seen as a threat and squashed. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 03:20:18
Cool post Rusty!
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:58:16
points for honesty.  
With a LN channel you need to make sure your counter-party doesn't attempt to post an old version of your transaction state. If they do you have to respond with a fraud proof, then you get all the monies. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:32:48
Well, for one, fees are a way of signaling your time preferences.  
You want fast inclusion? add a fee. Oh no, some jerk is filling up blocks with junk! Bump your fee.  
That way if/when we hit max blocks, there is some rational way of deciding what gets included.
@_date: 2015-12-01 12:25:08
I didn't assume re-use, but yeah makes sense. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:04:44
I really wonder if you're a false flag operation run by Peter himself. This is great.

The crypto assumptions are quite weak. Assuming the CT construction is legit, it's only broken if ECC is broken... which breaks Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2015-12-15 14:46:17
You can use CPFP to push through transactions in that case.

Fantastic talk.  
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:57:09
The security trade-off is the exact same as with something like P2SH. Unupgraded nodes will see "free money!" nonsense all over the place, but be unable to take the money. Wallets shouldn't care about those outputs and focus on what they own :)  
I'm assuming to pass around this extra info there will be a p2p service bit.  
Soon is what he'd like. Hardfork SegWit is already in Elements Alpha sidechain, but you're right, this softfork is untested. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:58:16
If you are watching the blockchain you know it's accurate. The only way to be defrauded is for the counter-party to put an old transaction in the blockchain, and for you(or someone else you gave a fraud proof bounty to) to not respond with the fraud proof within X blocks. X will be your security parameter that trades off time your funds may be locked in adversarial case and security.  
Lightning will have its own issues, but it's not some mumbo-jumbo off-chain solution.  
This might help: 
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:40:42
Literally worse case is sometimes some low-memory nodes will have to restart their instance. This is ignoring that people will simply roll out changes to mempool policy if it happens.  
To fix this, we are potentially increasing the bandwidth/disk usage/io by 20x. And this *still* makes a DoS attack just as cheap as before.  
I guess it's a philosophical difference. I want to design for the worst case, while this fix is for expected case.
@_date: 2015-06-23 18:40:32
It's not enforced by any consensus rules, so it's hard to say.
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:08:24
Miners really have no incentive to stick to default soft limits. They will mine blocks advantageous for them, at whatever size that ends up.

Yes, these things tend to happen to purely P2P protocols. Many altcoins have been pwned in various ways. No one is sure what large blocks would do to vulnerabilities since it hasn't happened yet in cryptocurrencies.

Ok... I'm pretty sure you know what I meant. They aren't "good" for scaling. Just like many say simply jacking up blocksize isn't a scaling mechanism. Clearly they mean it's not "good" to do so.
Furthermore, for the purpose of parents' argument, they aren't being sold as scaling solution, and will actively discourage you from thinking that way.
@_date: 2015-06-21 22:08:05
I tend to think of these numbers in "how many lightning network channels does this support?"  
Seems a lot more sensible since brute force blocksize scaling will never get us to world-changing numbers.

He just means a miner may pretend to take old dead money without having the necessary signature. Full archival nodes will still catch such behavior. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:40:20
Or just sync up your full node once a week. Lots of options. I think the bigger worry is simply hubs going down, or DoS. The un-cooperative one just needs to convince you to "cash out" first and they get their money right away while you wait. Time preferences of money I suppose. I see lots of game theory here, heh. I think in 99.99% of cases people will co-operate, or just wait until the node is back online to settle instantly.
@_date: 2015-12-02 21:00:08

Let's only use the Bitcoin blockchain directly when someone is untrustworthy to get back what we're owed.  
or  
Bitcoin blockchain as an adjudicator  
The 2nd is my favorite analogy. We don't take each other to court for each cup of coffee. We have smart contracts! Why take everyone to the crypto-court for the same? I have not yet had to go to court for a financial or criminal complaint, and I hope I never have to. Obviously we'll use the blockchain more than that, but it's a useful concept, and will probably become more accurate over time as we develop smart contracts.

To keep the same block reward it's something like $10 a transaction. On a lightning network that means $20 for setting up and taking down a channel to do nearly infinite transactions.

You're going to have to pay more to get real privacy, and local businesses are going to be pressured to follow AML/KYC laws. It's already the case today.  
It'll be interesting seeing if businesses get pressured to only "hub" with one Circle-like provider that only links with people that do AML/KYC or will they allow links that don't do AML/KYC, as long as the end-points know what's going on(I pay for coffee, coffee shop writes this down). It'll be fascinating to find out.
I'm slightly more worried about hubs being target for economic espionage.

If you keep saying this over nad over it still won't become true. Both sidechains and lightning networks would benefit greatly from increased blocksize. But you know that. You just like repeating falsehoods.

Step 1: Assume fees won't go to zero because orphan risk  
Step 2: People point out orphan risk fees don't secure the network  
Step 3: Write paper using ideas out there to reduce orphan risk to near zero for essentially unlimited blocks. (his construction is broken by design; he reintroduces orphan risk for no reason for new transactions. If cooperation exists, orphan risk for new transactions is still zero)  
Step 3a: Incorrectly cite Greg for lulz
Step 4: People point out that people won't pay fees if that's the case since miners can simply add your transaction.  
Step 5: Cite paper from Step 1 to prove that fees won't go to zero.

I have no idea what this means. History is full of facts. Like the fact that while Bitcoin adoption went up 100x, full node usage went down 10x.

In the hard-fork scenario you must update your software to know how much funds you have. In the soft-fork SW scenario, you don't. You will just see "magic free money" floating around similar to P2SH.(let's not run in circles here, I know the arguments about reduced security, just noting the difference :) )  


That's definitely a fair argument to be made. Magic constants are a great source of bike-shedding. I'd hope we'd have more holistic validation cost constraints by the time a hardfork happens. That's why I helped with the talk for HK. A number of Blockstreamers are quite worried about the mismatch of blocksize to cost of validation and have thought about trying to fix it. 


It's useless to speculate on motivations like this. Instead let's measure how bad blocks could be for validation and argue from there. The SW testnet should be helpful for this.

Monkey-math:  
1MB is ~110,376,000 transactions a year (3.5\*60\*60\*24\*365)  
Let's say people open and close a single channel a year.  
That's ~55,188,000 million people able to have open channels, and doing ~infinity transactions inside LN. These channels can be kept open indefinitely. 
Of course in real life people will have more than one channel, will probably have to close channels due to people not cooperating, etc. But let's pretend for now.  
VISA has about 4,000 tps maybe on average. That's 126,144,000,000 transactions a year.  
So if each LN user does 126,144,000,000/55,188,000=2,285 transactions, then 1MB is ~VISA. This is pretty easy if real micropayments exist, like they do in LN!  
In the end though, centralized payment systems are inevitably cheaper, so it's not the best comparison.

He still believes in full RBF, but he seems happy with at least limited being rolled out.

You are correct. The main differences is it costs more because you have to add *another* input per bump, which is worse for privacy. Any RBF variant leaks info already.

@_date: 2015-06-19 12:03:32
There's probably room for both types of RBFs. For example, nodes could simply forward only safe versions, and this still allows a fee market to develop.  
Long-term people are going to have to use payment channels or green addresses for instant conf(or some cool solution others dream up!). Otherwise, you'll have to let the block get made.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:14:28


I think that's a misnomer. It's a significantly stronger security model than SPV(bitcoinj-style, anyways). Companies can and do run old nodes because the Core developers have not forced them to upgrade. In a non-malicious softfork scenario you just worry about your own money, not others'.

Hard forks are a Mutually Assured Destruction proposition without quick resolution. What you're suggesting probably would result in many long-running forks of various caps. Bitcoin would literally be destroyed unless everyone caved and agreed to one size quickly.

I hope others come to understand why people are skeptical that Satoshi's plan(as imagined in this thread) would have set the world on fire.

Not true. It merely reduces the amount of bandwidth needed to propagate new blocks(provided you have already spend bandwidth getting the included transactions). 
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:31:58


Very true. But we could say that if you're not filling the block completely, it's likely a smaller block that could be filled will be getting more fees overall. Seem likely?  
The current science suggests we need full blocks, so aiming towards a full block scenario with "enough" fees, whatever that is, is what we need to do.

It's a good question. The problem is that if there are 1000 chains, all being used heavily, this would reduce decentralization. Blockstream wants to use this purely as testing.  
It's another tragedy of the commons type problem. Miners could include extension blocks to soft fork a blocksize increase... we have to hope miners understand that without consensus, these things are very dangerous and can be centralizing.
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:08:15
Adding incentives to 51% is the issue. Instead of simply ordering transactions, slight majority can literally change the protocol and full nodes will follow.  
They can do it for a relatively short period, and then runaway with their larger block bounty.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:32:48
ok I was harsh. I apologize. Here's what he's talking about.  
  
There is fairly large cost savings to full RBF per bump, and also means you don't need to have extra UTXOs lying around, which is a UX problem. For example, FSS-RBF means that if you buy bitcoin from Coinbase they'd probably want to send you two UTXOs, with one being for fee bumping. Each transaction you need to bump you will probably also have to create another output to help out later. And this only lets you bump once total, unless you find more UTXOs lying around.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:26:32
Afraid that someone might read this drivel and think it's insightful, I'll just say that if you can't internalize costs, you can't just say "free market" as a win button in an argument.

You get far less security by using an alt, for one. Much easier to attack the network.

So let's say you have Alice, Bob, and Hub. Alice and Bob both have 1 BTC to send to each other.  
If Alice and Bob are to transact with each other through Hub, Hub will need to lock up enough to send max to both Alice and Bob. So 2 + 2 BTC needs to be locked up. This is in contrast to Alice and Bob just hooking up and locking up 2 BTC total.  
This extra capital is essentially locked up for "no reason" in this toy scenario.

Exchanges could just wait more confirmations like other weaker altcoins do.   
An attack, while possible, won't necessarily happen because they may be too busy propping up the hashrate of the chain with most work(and if they believe XT is the true chain they'll be busy mining it).

Long-term it's going to be RBF. It's a rational miner choice, and allows for the highest fee-bump space savings. In a healthy mining market there is no way to "punish" a miner, so it's fruitless to build a system around doing so.  
Short-term FSS is a great step. 90% of what I want. Saves a decent amount of space(=fees), allows people to "unstuck" their bitcoin in a natural decentralized way. Fee market is coming! I'm a happy bitcoiner.

Neither is 1GB.
I hear Paypal is pretty good these days.

AKA it's not enough. We really need to target something that will complement layer 2 innovations.  
Like in lightning network paper, 130MB blocks is enough for 7billion people to have 2 channels open. That number is still quite high, but slightly less improbable.

The real problem is picking a blocksize that is large enough to let people open/close channels and the like, while also small enough to apply fee pressure to fund the network as subsidy goes down. Tricky!

You can still validate that your *own* money is valid and confirmed. You shouldn't care about others' money.  


The *longest valid chain based on your current accepted ruleset*. You can't prove there is no secret softfork right now. So technically by your definition we could all be SPV and we should just run bitcoinj. It's a pretty silly simplification.

Sidechains, with merge mining, only give the user SPV security.  
Therefore if it becomes successful as an "alternative" to Bitcoin main chain, the security overall of the system becomes significantly weaker.  
Hence it is not a scaling solution.  
It appears to be a great breeding ground for innovation though.

If it's the only way to maintain ledger consensus, I guess.  
The issue is I don't believe Gavin thinks increases are a stop gap of any kind.  
Gavin does not agree that full blocks are acceptable, and will agitate to increase the extension block if the time comes. Maybe that's ok, I don't know.

Not a fan of essentially unbounded growth, but I'm actually mostly concerned about his mining threshold. Make it 95%+ or please don't even push it.  
edit: Pieter Wuille said as much in the mailing list:  


I've seen ideas around hard fork proposals that involve a block version
vote (a la BIP34, BIP66, or my more recent versionbits BIP draft). I
believe this is a bad idea, independent of what the hard fork itself is.
Ultimately, the purpose of a hard fork is asking the whole community to
change their full nodes to new code. The purpose of the trigger mechanism
is to establish when that has happened.
Using a 95% threshold, implies the fork can happen when at least 5% of
miners have not upgraded, which implies some full nodes have not (as miners
are nodes), and in addition, means the old chain can keep growing too,
confusing old non-miner nodes as well.
Ideally, the fork should be scheduled when one is certain nodes will have
upgraded, and the risk for a fork will be gone. If everyone has upgraded,
no vote is necessary, and if nodes have not, it remains risky to fork them
I understand that, in order to keep humans in the loop, you want an
observable trigger mechanism, and a hashrate vote is an easy way to do
this. But at least, use a minimum timestamp you believe to be reasonable
for upgrade, and a 100% threshold afterwards. Anything else guarantees that
your forking change happens *knowingly* before the risk is gone.
You may argue that miners would be asked to - and have it in their best
interest - to not actually make blocks that violate the changed rule before
they are reasonably sure that everyone has upgraded. That is possible, but
it does not gain you anything over just using a 100% threshold, as how
would they be reasonably sure everyone has upgraded, while blocks creater
by non-upgraded miners are still being created?
TL;DR: use a timestamp switchover for a hard fork, or add a block voting
threshold as a means to keep humans in the loop, but if you do, use 100% as

@_date: 2015-06-28 23:09:58
This is definitely true, but it changes the equation on how big blocks "have to be" to service a population.  
For example, the Lightning Network authors estimate 130MB blocks to service 7 billion people.  
That is almost ~1.6% the size of Gavin's end blocksize. A factor of 50+ could mean a lot more decentralization, with virtually anyone using the network.

It makes no sense really. It needs to be long enough to not waste hashes on stale blocks and resist partitioning attacks, and makes much more sense to work on other ways of doing fast payments.  
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:08:13
Given an infinite blocksize, miners will add transactions up to the fee which offsets the orphan risk, correct? Long-term this will chase to larger and larger blocksizes, with nearly all expenses going to infrastructure rather than hashing.  
(You could also do a mandatory minimum fee, which fixes this.)

Gavin's Increase:

OTOH, they are much less in consensus against raises period. Sipa seems much more inclined to raise blocksize compared to, say, Peter Todd. Garzik is proposing what he considers a sane alternative since he sees the community wants a raise.

Specifically the following is what I told them:








Basically both let you replace one transaction with another that pays a
higher fee. First-seen-safe replace-by-fee adds the additional criteria
that all outputs of the old transaction still need to be paid by the new
transaction, with &gt;= as many Bitcoins. Basically, it makes sure that if
someone was paid by tx1, then tx2 will still pay them.
I've written about how wallets can use RBF and FSS-RBF to more
efficiently use the blockchain on the bitcoin-development mailing list:
Basically, for the purpose of increasing fees, RBF is something like %50
cheaper than CPFP, and FSS-RBF is something like %25 cheaper.
In addition, for ease of implementation, my new FSS-RBF has a number of
other restrictions. For instance, you can't replace multiple
transactions with one, you can't replace a transaction whose outputs
have already been spent, you can't replace a transaction with one that
spends additional unconfirmed inputs, etc. These restrictions aren't
"set in stone", but they do make the code simpler and less likely to
have bugs.
In comparison my previous standard RBF patch can replace multiple
transactions with one, can replace long chains of transactions, etc.
It's willing to do more computation before deciding if a transaction
should be replaced, with more complex logic; it probably has a higher
chance of having a bug or DoS attack.
You've probably seen the huge controversy around zeroconf with regard to
standard replace-by-fee. While FSS RBF doesn't make zeroconf any safer,
it also doesn't make it any more dangerous, so politically with regard
to zeroconf it makes no difference. You *can* still use it doublespend
by taking advantage of how different transactions are accepted
differently, but that's true of *every* change we've ever made to
Bitcoin Core - by upgrading to v0.10 from v0.9 you've also "broken"
zeroconf in the same way.
Having said that... honestly, zeroconf is pretty broken already. Only
with pretty heroic measures like connecting to a significant fraction of
the Bitcoin network at once, as well as connecting to getblocktemplate
supporting miners to figure out what transactions are being mined, are
services having any hope of avoiding getting ripped off. For the average
user their wallets do a terrible job of showing whether or not an
unconfirmed transaction will go through. For example, Schildbach's
Bitcoin wallet for Android has no code at all to detect double-spends
until they get mined, and I've been able to trick it into showing
completely invalid transactions. In fact, currently Bitcoin XT will
relay invalid transactions that are doublepsends, and Schildbach's
wallet displays them as valid, unconfirmed, payments. It's really no
surprise to me that nearly no-one in the Bitcoin ecosystem accepts
unconfirmed transactions without some kind of protection that doesn't
rely on first-seen-safe mempool behavior. For instance, many ATM's these
days know who their customers are due to AML requirements, so while you
can deposit Bitcoins and get your funds instantly, the protection for
the ATM operator is that they can go to the police if you rip them off;
I've spoken to ATM operators who didn't do this who've lost hundreds or
even thousands of dollars before giving up on zeroconf.
My big worry with zeroconf is a service like Coinbase or Shapeshift
coming to rely on it, and then attempting to secure it by gaining
control of a majority of hashing power. For instance, if Coinbase had
contracts with 80% of the Bitcoin hashing power to guarantee their
transactions would get mined, but 20% of the hashing power didn't sign
up, then the only way to guarantee their transactions could be for the
80% to not build on blocks containing doublespends by the 20%. There's
no way in a decentralized network to come to consensus about what
transactions are or are not valid without mining itself, so you could
end up in a situation where unless you're part of one of the big pools
you can't reliably mine at all because your blocks may get rejected for
containing doublespends.
One of my goal with standard replace-by-fee is to prevent this scenario
by forcing merchants and others to implement ways of accepting zeroconf
transactions safely that work in a decentralized environment regardless
of what miners do; we have a stronger and safer Bitcoin ecosystem if
we're relying on math rather than trust to secure our zeroconf
transactions. We're also being more honest to users, who right now often
have the very wrong impression that unconfirmed transactions are safe to
accept - this does get people ripped off all too often!
Anyway, sorry for the rant! FWIW I updated my FSS-RBF patch and am
waiting to get some feedback:
    
Suhas Daftuar did find a pretty serious bug in it, now fixed. I'm
working on porting it to v0.10.2, and once that's done I'm going to put
up a bounty for anyone who can find a DoS attack in the patch. If no-one
claims the bounty after a week or two I think I'll start feeling
confident about using it in production.

That turn-key solution is something I'm hoping for too. You could set up a Tor hidden service node from home, then connect remotely via SPV. Unfortunately I can't find a light client that lets me do that quite yet(I think it only connects to in-the-clear nodes, without authentication). 
In the end, my point was at 8MB blocks it would get harder, and 8GB blocks are a whole other ball game. It's not a free parameter. It has trade-offs. It's going to cut out some people from being able to run a full node, and simply saying "well not everyone will run one" isn't 100% satisfying to everyone, especially those being cut out.  
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:01:40


Sure! Let's imagine a land where Core hardforks once a year, without fail. This means that people won't be able to rely on the "math" of Bitcoin for longer than a year, but instead on meta-consensus data feeds, such as the latest blog post by Gregory Maxwell. Each user will then have to sit around and predict if the latest Core Fork will be accepted by miners, if they Don't Like Greg Very Much, etc.   
In contrast with a softfork, if not malicious(malicious softforks are probably the worst), you can basically just ignore it. (obviously there are security softforks which you shouldn't ignore...) Heck, I had trouble getting my money out of blockchain.info for a long time because they didn't support P2SH until fairly recently!


Says who? Someone is mining junk! It's invalid! I spend a lot of extra-consensus man hours and found what was happening. They implemented Greg Gets 10BTC Every Block and I don't agree. I will stay on this chain because I simply don't agree with the change. OTOH, if you don't like soft-fork segwit, there is no reason you can't just ignore it. The longest chain is still valid. You can still send money to segwit addresses but not accept money at them.  
Overall, a hard-fork will definitely happen, but this is why I'm against them except as a big cleanup/fix when a soft-fork is just too ugly. Something like Validation Cost Metric, Flexcap, UTXO set cap, growth schedule, timewarp attack fix, etc, are all too ugly in a soft-fork scenario, at least in my opinion. I'd rather batch them together in a big ol' hardfork. We're just not ready for it yet because we have too many unanswered questions. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 20:48:06

edit: if I know my history right, it's been worked out before, but people like Maxwell really didn't want to say that miners could enforce a blocksize increase unilaterally, so they didn't discuss it too much. Now that we are in a MAD-style situation, it seems Adam has changed his tune.

Luckily no one is talking about doing 1MB forever, and we still have room. Fees are still very cheap($0.03 for transactions to get into next block, from my last estimate. Way cheaper if you wait.). As they slowly ramp up we'll get a better sense of how much of current transaction volume is just garbage nonsense. If fees do raise 2x, 4x, 8x, that's a positive signal for actual economic activity and future funding of the network(and still wouldn't shut out most transactions). I'm guessing getting consensus for a bump of some kind would be more realistic then.

Gavin: I want 20MB+ blocks  
Core Dev(s): I want smaller blocksize, but am ok with 1MB.  
Gavin: Ok ok, let's do 20MB blocks.  
Core Dev(s): Nah  
Gavin: OK FINE 20MB+ blocks and I don't care what you say!!! Miners and exchanges want it!!!  
Chinese Miners/Exchanges: Actually we've been meaning to talk to yo...   
Gavin: [cuts off] How does 8MB sound?
@_date: 2015-06-08 02:51:58
Theory suggests the amount of marginal hashing goes to zero per transaction, and blocks will become ever larger. 
@_date: 2015-06-17 03:00:44
It wouldn't. Which is why it's a stupid "fix". 
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:43:42
Right, but this would be broken consensus. An attacker would have incentive to fork you off and wouldn't even have to be particularly good at it.  
Ask yourself: If this method worked, could it replace Proof of Work? Why or why not?
@_date: 2015-06-19 18:07:01
Just outputs. You want to make sure that people who are getting paid still get paid.  
This means you have to add inputs to bump your fee.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:36:38
If you believe blocks are naturally full, because long-term miners will be incentivized to include just about anything in it with ~0 fee, then it makes perfect sense. Bumping each time cap is hit just means unlimited block size, regardless of decentralization.

Give Friendly Yaks?
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:11:51


I'd take a bet it won't get *worse*. Most mining is already done in bare bones warehouses in the mountains using hydro. Reducing orphan rates(pressure to co-locate and not validate) and variance reduction(pressure to sell hashes in a pool without selection block contents) are being worked on.  
The supply chain/scale issue is the part that has no easy answer. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:49:45
I don't mean to take away too much from the article, but Tor is centrally controlled. It's multi-jurisdictional, and was funded by the USG originally, which helps.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:16:43
As has been noted over and over, this is simply untrue. Resistance to large block sizes by these folks has been around since 2011, far earlier than the idea of Blockstream, Sidechains(TM), and Lightning Networks(or even Hub-spoke payments).  
It's a negotiation on different visions of Bitcoin. No need to malign people who have spend thousands of hours of their life in service to maintaining the network. 
@_date: 2015-06-19 13:20:55

No it hasn't. Re-read his e-mail.
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:49:26
He's made it clear that if such a fork goes through, and the network centralizes, he'll just sell off his coins and leave before the other bag-holders catch wind.  
That said I don't think the 20MB++ thing will get merged by any appreciable community. Much more likely something like 4 to 8MB, one time step. High enough to placate the "expand now" crowd and low enough that Core devs may go grudgingly along.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:21:59
It's definitely one of the worst periods of centralization. My guess is that we have 85%+ of hashing from private mining installations.

@_date: 2015-06-21 22:05:52
Why aren't we stopping there if we don't want to risk decentralization? Hopefully we've figured out other ways to scale by then too.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:06:31
Pro-raise: More transactions per second possinble.  
Anti-raise: Increased resources required to run full nodes(that enforce consensus) and mining can be more vulnerable to centralization/censor pressure.  
Tons more e-ink can be spilled on it, but that's the basic fundamental tension.
@_date: 2015-06-16 01:02:47

@_date: 2015-06-22 19:21:51
Well it's hardly an "attack" per se: The miners who have been centralized and regulated will enforce(or be forced to) soft fork in censor lists and the like.  
Without a vibrant, distributed mining ecosystem these risks are quite real.

It makes it easier for policy-makers to argue that more regulation is needed if there isn't a wide-spread participation in the validation and running of the network.  
NSA could clearly crush Bitcoin now if they wanted to. Making it politically unpalatable and not cheap is the best we can do for now.

Are we talking about decentralized cryptocurrencies? I'd be shocked if we just had the one tbh.  
Even today Bitcoin is at 95% of the total crypto market cap. Outside of Monero there are is no serious altcoin developers. Ethereum might grab a few percentage though, but it will always be a niche tech project due to Vitalik's extremely strange ideas about consensus.

There were rumors that pools were already attacking each other in other ways. Block discarding, etc.  
That said, a lot of this crap goes away with smaller pools. Someday I hope we can have 100 pools at 1%.

If you aren't running a full node, you are not getting the full power of the network.

I will be scanning the blocks for transactions with offensive addresses comrade. Just apply my soft-fork patch.
@_date: 2015-06-07 13:29:25
If I knew for a fact that usage would explode if given space, I might buy it. I really don't think it is though. I'd say half of all transactions today are junk, and I don't see usage exploding anytime soon.  
We have to build the extra layers, software, computer security, etc, before anyone has any reason to use it other than avoiding censorship(which is worth it by itself!).
@_date: 2015-06-12 23:15:11
That's actually really concise. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:55:41
On this note, we need to be able to run a full node at home, and access it remotely with our SPV in a secure way.  
Right now all we can do with BitcoinJ is connect insecurely to a specific IP address, AFAIK.  
I simply am not at my home machine enough to *use* it when I need to spend Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-20 13:17:58
Right, I was more thinking you weaving those acknowledgements into the proposal so I'd know the difference in 5 seconds. The phrase "IBLT" doesn't exist anywhere, so I have no idea why you didn't use it, for example. "I didn't know" is a fine enough reason :)
@_date: 2015-12-24 03:29:37
That's the most straight forward way. I don't think trolling is very likely in a systematic way due to this backup.

Not if miners don't want to. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 03:09:25
Eh, someone really needs to tell him that scalability isn't quite solved yet. The "roadmap" is a theoretical one that is simply demonstrating a centralized version of Bitcoin could "work" as well as Visa. It really says nothing about whether that system would be decentralized. 
edit: Actually, he's referencing Gavin's roadmap. Hm.
Of course he's still kind of right if we include Lightning Network style transactions. Billions could be done a day with 100MB blocks in some tech future.
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:41:48


Chinese miners and exchanges aren't. Chinese miners make up more than 50% of mining.


Very true, but it's also just as true people are woefully misinformed about the security differences. Freaking exchanges are using SPV or trusting other companies to run instances for them.  


Or we will have tons of orphan blocks because Chinese miners decide they will drop Western blocks in favor of their own when races happen....  


Then I'm a little baffled why Gavin is pushing for 20MB + inflation(of blocksize) increase in one step.
@_date: 2015-06-26 18:45:42


Wait, what?
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:00:47
My guess is any auto-increasing proposal at this point is DoA. (or at least wouldn't sway people who are skeptical) 
Maxwell, Back, and others still want to primarily keep it at 1MB, and keep a smaller emergency hardfork in their pocket in case things go badly after cap hits. They will not "sign off" on unbounded increases (this is AFAICT)  
@_date: 2015-06-02 17:28:22
A little more connected than that :)
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:33:18
Am I taking crazy pills or can 1 and 2 be merged to: "Hardfork to 2MB"?
@_date: 2015-06-24 10:51:06


He's making the most noise against Gavin's stupid hard fork threat. 


You're literally talking about the entire technical set minus Gavin. If they all left, you'd be left with a single developer who basically took a break for the last year.

@_date: 2015-06-29 14:23:29
Misleading headline  
It breaks *some* retail use, and retailers will simply adapt.  
Current/Future methods of adapting:  
1) GreenAddress-style 0-conf.  
2) Only accept naked 0-conf on low-value items, minimize your risk.  
3) Scorched Earth policy where you burn the person's bitcoin instead of letting their double-spend get through.  
4) Hub-spoke/Lightning Networks do secure 0-conf.  
Notice how Garzik, who was hostile to Peter's last push, agrees with this. He just wants to give the ecosystem time to evolve to the end-game model.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:34:46


It's funny that in accusing people of logical fallacies you are making on yourself.  
Most want that want status quo want it because hardforking is a strain on consensus, and they think 1MB is the least bad choice for now. For example, Maxwell thinks 1MB is too high given the levels of decentralization, but he believes with some more time and engineering we can "catch up" and make it healthy again.  
Aka False Dilemma. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 14:50:58
Not necessarily. But as long as there is a path from A to B, A can pay B and vice versa.

There's at least 3:  
1) Increase now  
2) Hold until we get fee market, then increase  
3) Hold until we figure out how to scale properly  
And of course (1) breaks down to camps of what size, and why, and what conditions need to be met to increase again.  
I see fractals.

a little bored at work while experiments run... can you tell? ;)
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:01:20
Remember: 130MB blocks with Lightning Networks could mean enough channels for literally everyone on planet earth. Virtually free, instant transactions with anyone else, even when blocks are full. (modulo some sort of block dynamism that makes sure channels don't get DoS'd... hopefully that can be figured out)  
( and obviously there is no way to ensure that companies won't take more block space, but it's an interesting thought experiment)  
Even without naive scaling to infinity, there are tons to be done that only require mild soft forks on today's consensus system! And I'm hopeful that Treechains-esque things eventually get worked out due to compact proofs, like zk-SNARKs. That stuff will of course take time, but there is a lot of room even in non-moon math land.

I think integration of personally run full nodes at home with our mobile wallets makes a lot of sense actually.  
I'm thinking of working on this as a side-project with a developer friend.  
This would be a good test, no?  
User pairs SPV wallet with their home full node(over RPC or something) and gets UTXO's from a watch wallet that gets imported.  
I don't run a full node for my actual wallet, which is where the *real* benefit comes from.  
Part of the problem of course is that the consensus library hasn't been extracted yet, but this could be an interesting hack.

How is the fee set? The problem I foresee is the same problem we have on pricing externalities: We don't know how much it costs real world, and even if we could quantify, there's not a good way of signaling this to the system itself.  
If we could solve this we could simply set a minimum transaction fee and get rid of blocksizes(well... game theoretically).

It's cool stuff, but unfortunately getting it to be a usable *money* system is still out of reach. There is no SPV mode for that type of system. For general proof-of-publication stuff I think there's nothing inherently wrong with it, and it may actually get deployed as that first, for banks, shares, and timestamping services. Miners can add on these services without bothering others. 
If we ever figure out recursive zk-SNARKs then the money aspect of it may become usable too: Just send your recipient a very small proof that you computed the full chain of custody until now. That's why you haven't been hearing a lot about it yet: We're waiting on cryptographers to keep iterating and improving on that end!

Gavin's proposal only gets us a 20x bump. We can't even really fathom a decentralized network with 100MB blocks today, much less 1GB+ blocks required to "service" the world using Layer 1 tech. 20x bump does nothing for use cases.  
I'm confident a real solution to scaling will be found over time. Lightning Networks, basic tech improvements, sharding like treechains, zk-SNARKs, etc. are already being discussed as 10000x improvements.  
Today we have to focus on the problems it can actually solve today.
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:28:13

Well one way channels in LN are two way channels where the initiator is the only one who funds it, in a sense. Alice funds channel with Bob. After Alice pays for coffee, then it becomes more like a two-way channel since Bob could pay you back sometime, or route through himself to Alice. 
I think current LN design is to open these type of channels because of the reduced capital required.  
(I took yesterday to read the LN paper from top to bottom.)

Anything for "adoption".  
Meanwhile serious people are working on making Bitcoin harder to attack, not easier. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 12:23:30
Right, that's what I mean.  
I'd say the scale of what blocksize increase can do in a decentralized way is a sticking point. Possible 32MB bump(miners must take action to ratchet up) vs deterministic 8GB bump(miners have to take action to ratchet down or stop).  
On that note, I've been wanting to propose to Gavin that he add in a voting mechanism to say "stop increasing" or "drop to X MB" in case something goes wrong. Like if 75% of miners turn off the bit, it stops the growth or something. Gavin says we can soft-fork to stop, but pre-soft-forking is totally doable, and could potentially stop a lot of pain later.
They have other disagreements re:0-conf too, but not sure they're tied to this debate directly. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 12:05:39
replace "should" with "could", and I'd agree  
It's not free, and honestly won't help in the long term with regards to "instant confirmation" stuff. If we want fast, we need lightning networks or other trust mechanisms.

Increases orphan risk somewhat, encouraging centralization of mining further, and wastes security. Also, it slightly lowers the size of mining you need to start excluding other's blocks more aggressively.  
Anything above 2 minutes wouldn't kill Bitcoin, but it would certainly have tradeoffs vs simple size increase. Simple size increase of course has its costs as well.

@_date: 2015-12-30 18:34:04
I think we're misunderstanding each other. Bitcoin Core wallet waits for confirmations *even with fully validating up to date nodes* due to the risk of double-spending.  
Indeed, a non-upgraded full node will have more trouble doing 0-conf safely. Same with simply differing mempool policies. I think talking about Bitcoin as a 0-conf securer is distracting, and explicitly not in the security model.  
Older bitcoind nodes can effectively detect double-spending, inflation, etc within the longest valid blockchain and still know how much bitcoin they own. SPV is blindly trusting the PoW.

Well then it's over. We're already begging pools not to 51%, and the economics aren't going to get much better. Bigger pool &gt; smaller pool.

I'm actually curious. Could you compile a list of technical folks(people who submit/review PR for Bitcoin Core specifically) that are positive towards Gavin's patch?

@_date: 2015-06-29 02:58:58


It'd be really clear if this was happening, considering they are all open ledgers. Right now Litecoin, which is currently in a speculation rush, has roughly .1 transactions per second. No one else  is even close after that. I think it's pretty clear the demand isn't there yet.

Even if I believed that the burden of proof is in those who want to limit block size, we have far more evidence that it is needed than the other side. There is simply no plausible scenario that secures the network in an unlimited block scenario unless you assume altruistic mining.

I don't think that's the case wrt p2pool. Instead:

In fact the orphan rate is lower, due to the more efficient passing of transactions and blocks.

Indeed. Which is why device hardening would be required in both firmware and hardware, and single-sig/device funds are a bad idea long-term for any wealth of consequence.

@_date: 2014-05-16 17:36:50
The fees only need ot be high enough to ensure an attack is exceedingly costly.  
Traditional payment networks involve:  
1) computing infrastructure  
2) brick and mortar  
3) Regulatory cost  
4) lawyers  
5) fraud prevention  
etc etc.  
There's no reason it can't be cheaper by avoiding these(end-user will reintroduce these costs as they desire of course). We don't know how much security is enough though, so it's an open question to what a good cost is.

Sure.  
Put it on a piece of paper.  
Put it somewhere safe.  
If you don't find that safe enough, use the additional passphrase option(I think Electrum might not have this until 2.0, which is coming, including integration with Trezor!). That way even if some goon gets your word list, they'd still have to know your passphrase to find account balance greater than 0, since any passphrase they enter is a "valid" account.

If we up the blocksize cap to 10MB, max that out, and kill off the block subsidy over time, it's going to be *way* less than that. The electricity price will be what people are willing to pay in txn fees. That's it.  
edit: I'm still wrong: 
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:32:43
I honestly can't wait until another couple halvings happen.  
The block reward is a blessing for extremely early adoption, but now it's a curse.

I'm not sure that's what they mean, unless you are saying Google is going to release a googlecoin that isn't just USD in digital form. (And regulated just as paypal is )
I put this at a tiny probability.

It's in reference to the idea that there should be a parallel ecosystem, Bitcoin's "beta" network, that eventually becomes the regular network, after a long freeze period. All coins get "sent" to the next network, and a new "Betacoin" ecosystem starts.
Not an alt. Should have figured there was a copypasta coin with that name, but the name as this idea was not coined by me.

I'm being American-centric, my bad.  
If we're being honest I don't think bitcoin spending will be done in person a whole lot, at least on-chain.  
Maybe if you forget your wallet or something, or if easy-peasy point of sale systems are put in place for it.

What are the best mitigation ideas for block witholding so far?
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:54:00
Before a block is created, two valid transactions can be sent out. One will get accepted by the network, and the other rejected.
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:53:24
I really hope they make it more attractive for people. Pool consolidation is a huge threat.

@_date: 2015-06-29 18:18:31
If we go to 2MB blocks, and have a reward halving in 2016, suddenly we are using 4x less electricity per transaction! Wow!  
More seriously, this math misses:  
1) Mining reward is dropping, dropping total energy usage over time.  
2) Larger blocks would make this ratio lower  
3) They aren't including off-chain transactions at all, which are eventually anchored on the network.  
4) Once/If Lightning Networks take off simply looking at the published data will not tell you at all how many secure transactions have been made off-chain. Could be 3 to 4 orders of magnitude off.  
Many guess that \ is already roughly 99% of volume, so the stat is pretty meaningless already.

PoS to secure cryptocurrency is using cryptocurrency to demonstrate who owned cryptocurrency and when.  
Circular "technology".

@_date: 2014-04-27 02:20:53
Wow, that's impressive. I bet that puts a noticeable downward pressure on the price of BTC itself, as I'm guessing 90% of BTC sales are put directly to exchanges.  
@_date: 2014-09-03 13:42:40
Bitcoin is not lacking full nodes.  
I'm not theoretically against PoS, but:  
1) They are not as consensus-providing as PoW, because staking is begging the question in some sense. You're proving consensus by doing stuff within the system. The only way to get around this is checkpointing of some sort(not trusting longest chain) and assuming everyone will see double-signatures. Different security model. Maybe it's good enough, I don't know.    
2) There are no known ways of providing SPV clients for PoS, as each client has to build the entire staking history. 
3) We have enough full nodes in Bitcoin. Once pruning is achieved, and partial-storage is usable, we really won't have any issues.  
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:31:59
Oh I agree totally. I'm just trying to figure out how much they understand under the hood :P
@_date: 2015-06-17 12:50:27
Hey Mike when is the last time you had a protocol idea that wasn't completely baffling?  
Full nodes as servers only?
Red lists?
Punishing miners for including "double spends"?  
Adding DoS-prone, unauthenticated peer messages into bitcoind?  
Adding censorship to hidden services?  
I feel so stupid from me defending you in the past. The others were right about you from the beginning.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:26:31
What if the GFW gets beefed up even more?  
A lot of their concern is due to the GFW as well.  
Let's target what we can hit today. 8MB is probably ok. (this coming from someone who'd prefer 4MB after a period of full blocks to incentivize fee markets and scaling solutions)
@_date: 2015-06-22 18:29:40
It was a joke :P
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:35:33
I don't believe it will fill up fast, but the logic is quite similar.  
If you believe that full blocks are never ok, then you will never be satisifed with a paritcular blocksize if Bitcoin takes off. There will always be demand for more room in a successful scenario.  
Which is why many of us don' t think bumps "scale". We need other ways of doing it long-term. I'm not against a 8MB bump per se, other than the issue of I don't think Gavin will ever allow 2nd layer solutions to develop because they are "hard".
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:33:15
I'm really curious to see how many nodes we will have one all this, and pruning/partial blockchain storage is done.
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:18:41
they still have to figure out the one password, and cracking takes quite a while.
@_date: 2014-10-01 00:09:46
AFAIK they nuked the circuit that allows changes/updates, to reduce that attack vector. Someone could load a bad bootloader that gives you no warning.

Specifics or I don't care.  
If you don't want to give specifics, you shouldn't be so inflammatory. Just say "to spend more time with family" or whatever.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:25:12
As long as a miner thinks it's worth it to mine for the fees, it's essentially free otherwise. We're assuming that the total demand for transactions in all crypto-currency is bound by people's needs today, not that adding another side-chain will make it twice as much.  
The real danger comes later when block reward goes away from main chain... but that was always a worry.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:48:30

It still might not be so bad if "smart property" miners are rolled out.  
Power/cooling will be done on a smallish number of sites, but people can point their miner to any pool they like, and only that pool. Worst the mining plant could do is unplug the miner.

Splitting the txn space will be the ultimate goal, so miners/verifiers only have to process small parts of the system while maintaining consensus.  
So far, off-chain solutions are the state of the art, but obviously not optimal.  
Hopefully something like sidechains or treechains will allow it to scale as much as people like.  
Peter Todd said something to the effect of "we want the system to be so scalable we can program it in Python".

If you want to run experimental forks of things like Electrum, yes. There are a lot of wallets working hard on integration as we speak. I think they haven't been officially rolled in due to lack of demand, as devices are just now reaching the masses.

Outside of the block reward orphan risk "mining getting more expensive" makes no difference on transaction fee.

Micro-bitcoin? mu-bitcoin? mew-bitcoin? you-bitcoin? you-bee-tee-see? All of which are 3+ syllables, a little long. So then we have to switch to "micro-bit" which destroys the metric argument unless we rename a bitcoin a bit.

This is the main problem with Bitcoin: to remain trustless, it means that theoretically you must wait for it to be included in a block for any security guarantees.  
You can introduce some trust(trust the sender, or co-signer like greenaddres.ot), then accept a transaction instantly, but that's up to trust!

Like, can you point to the "pools" at the link provided and make it add up to more than 50%?
I'm getting 39% if you add up ALL the pools (with Ghash) that aren't known entities(AFAICT) while rounding *up*, making it a probable severe overestimation.  
edit: taken from the other direction, I added up the pools I know for sure aren't part of Ghash(discus/slush/etc) and got 56.4%. Unless you are claiming these older pools are now being hosted/owned by Ghash I'm calling BS.

Ships have shorted gotBTC...
Their "strategy" is baffling. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:35:03
Sure! It's called Big-O notation:   
It just allows us to talk about how *difficult* or *complex* a particular thing is as it scales. It only worried about the "big picture", not the small details.  
Examples:  
1) With n people in a circle, how many different handshakes are there? O(n^2 ). It's less than n^2, but scales like n^2.  
2) How long does it take you to count n pairs of shoes? 2*n shoes -&gt; O(n)  
3) How long does it take you to count to 5? 5 -&gt; O(1)  
Not great examples, just trying to give an intuition. Gavin's O(1) proposal means that even if we go to a million transactions per block, the amount of data we have to transmit at block-finding time will be some constant, same as 1MB block sizes.

1) Number of full nodes needed is probably quite small. Every single one would have to lie to disallow you from seeing the real state of the network. A few thousand beefy nodes are all that is probably needed.  
2) Mining is a bit more dire. Miners create the order of transactions, and are currently very centralized. If it doesn't get more centralized the network shouldn't break, but it makes it a lot more susceptible to poltiical pressure, and changes can't happen unless pools sign off. (edit) And the fact is that every other cryptocurrency will suffer a similar problem. PoS might be less in danger, but may also not be as secure to begin with. It's an open problem.

From the dev mailing list discussion, it'll probably be something like:  
1) All miners agree on a canonical ordering for txns.  
2) Propagate the block header  
3) All the while use the fancy inverse tacheon beam filter thing to keep all the miner's mempools "synced", or at least aware of each other. You know that I know that you know about txn and that I'm including it in my next block.  
4) As it's pretty much only the header being sent around, it goes a lot faster.

Not blockchain.info's "fault", outside of the fact that they really should be educating users on where it is safe to store these things, and on building good passwords.  
I personally don't know if solutions will ever be good enough for the average derp(people are too busy to underp about security) user. Trezor-like devices and m-of-n escrowed money will probably be standard for almost all bitcoin in the future.

I'm 24 minutes in, and I have a question about the "Ultimate Vault".  
While the blinding etc is cool, how does this stop the attacker from simply hacking the phone/device you use, ask your friends to sign a bad transaction, and it sends it to the attacker's wallet?  
The blinding means the other signers have no idea what they're signing, so the only judgement comes from "is a blinded txn sent to me".  
edit: Ok, so your phone you're using to craft the transaction is compromised. It intercepts the transaction, and replaces the amounts of a much larger amount and its own address. Your phone then does the blinding protocol, sending the blinded transactions to your friends. You call them saying "yeah I'm making a send of 200 satoshis, please sign". They all sign because they don't see what they're signing. Your money is now gone?  
What am I missing here?

So is this how he is explaining his exponential scoring mechanism?  
Let's just say most devs are skeptical.  
And last but not least, SPV clients are impossible when using PoS. Think carefully before treading into these waters.  
edit: "Under this model, we can clearly see how proof of stake works perfectly fine: we simply forbid nodes from reverting more than N blocks, and set N to be the security deposit length." AKA checkpoints?  
If you get partitioned, you're fucked until you phone a friend.

edit3: Great comment on disqus at the page: "Does this is any away affect autonomous agents? They won't know where to find "friends" who can give them extra information?" Yes. Yes it does. It devolves into some weird Web of Trust model(which we can't seem to get working for freaking e-mail).

Oh ok, I'm still a little fuzzy on the exact mechanism of proving. But I'm assuming that whatever side-currency is added on top of BTC would not be able to be moved, or a BTC-linked chain would reject it. Therefore main-chain miners shouldn't care.

Meet the scale-free network:   
Assuming it follows this shape, you should only need a few hops for a very large number of nodes on a network.  
Did some simulations, and gathered some facts. If we create a graph using preferential attachment(BA Algorithm), using k=4(every new node attached to 4 nodes in the graph) as our parameter we get:  
1000 nodes: 3 steps average  
10000 nodes: 3.9 steps average  
100000 nodes: TODO(still computing)  
And from Scholarpedia I found this excerpt:  








So yes, short paths, robust to simple random attacks on nodes and nodes simply dropping out, but more brittle than completely random network to targeted attacks of largest hubs.  However this only matters with regard to end-to-end connectivity to random hubs. It's far more likely you will be ~1 away from people you frequently interact with under this model, so not that much to "attack" wrt connectivity.

Oh, there we go. That's a bit safer, requiring the *utterly* hacked scenario.  
You might want to build in some 2FA if you're calling it "ultimate" then. And it's completely false to give the architecture, as presented, a "no single point of failure" solution.

Indeed. When they say it's insecure, I ask: "compared to what?".  
Bitcoin has an extremely high level of security. While I agree side chains can't do it all, I can certainly imagine lots of uses for it, including simply having a Bitcoin beta channel to test out new features. Miners would gladly mine it, just to make sure their future profits are less endangered by future updates.  
Who knows, if/when the community figures out tree chains, maybe it'll start as a side chain :P

The exponential backoff system makes guessing really slow though.  
I think a good rule of thumb is to make sure your pin is non-repeating digits.  
I do think re-shuffling should be an option though. It would also mean someone couldn't just take a single picture of your Trezor screen, then watch where you click. The attacker would have to essentially take video of both. Might as well go full-retard when it comes to security.

We can probably get to 2 minutes safely, since network connections are only getting faster, and more blocks allow for less variance in mining.

Ok no economist, but he used the word "arbitrage" talking about moving money from an environment where you can actually get money in and out, and one where you can't. It's impossible because there are barriers to doing so, hence risk, hence not arbitrage. (going from Wikipedia's definition here)

Huh. It doesn't immediately seem enforceable, because if I send you a normal uninflated block, the incentive is for you to start mining anyways, right? All that matters is that people build on the longest chain at the correct difficulty.

Ignore mushuforce. He's an idiot. 
Electrum uses SPV security, which validates balances by querying full nodes, and using the block headers to verify people worked hard on that branch. 
Node could lie by omission. Query multiple nodes to mitigate this. 
Also theoretically you are losing privacy tas you are asking full nodes for specific txns(well actually using a bloom filter but still leakage there )
Therefore don't use SPV for business purposes where you might get attacked. Or at least use that in conjunction with other services for validation.

@_date: 2014-12-08 17:44:35
Less. Hard to say exactly. 
Things you can do:  
1) Not forward invalid txns in your branch
2) Don't "accept payment" from the other fork in the chain.
...  
That's about it.  
Miners can't force anyone onto any chain that suddenly has different rules. But there is the network effect.

Shorter confirmations doesn't give much protection at the high end of value, only for small values, which aren't really that risky to begin with. 
In a more centralized model, something like OT, self-auditing nodes would control BTC via multisig, and do ledger transactions with users, until a user wants to settle, then the nodes would send the BTC back to the user's requested address.  
No one node can steal your money, and you wouldn't trust them with your entire bankroll.

Excerpt from page:  


Dogecoin address: DELfEvCF22kGBoXzx932byFNsGM6voGCqn
Focus Fusion is pleased to announce a possibility for contributing by using internet's very own digital currencies, Bitcoin and Dogecoin.
Bitcoin is the first fully open sourced digital currency which anyone anywhere in the world can use for free. It shares a common ground with Focus Fusion by being both disruptive and decentralized technology that has a potential to permanently change the way the world understands the concept of money. You can learn more about it on Bitcoin.org
Dogecoin builds upon Bitcoin's open sourced code and adds to the mix a whole lot of weird humor and community spirit. For more information about this absolutely hilarious digital currency (based on doge-meme) visit Dogecoin.com
At this time it won't be possible to receive individual perks for crypto-contributions. However, we are offering a reward to the Bitcoin and Dogecoin communities as a whole. We would like to offer our Golden perk to the Dogecoin and/or Bitcoin community if they are able to raise the required sum of $5000 worth of crypto-currency. This would allow the community to leave its mark on history by getting mentioned in the actual scientific papers when the break even happens.

This is actually really interesting.  
Researchers have figured out how to shoehorn this style of multisig, as well as blind sigs(different work), right on top of the existing protocol.  
What else is possible?  
One question: How are these actually used? If one gets enough parts together, as soon as it is created, it's dangerous because someone can steal the money by stealing the reconstructed private key. It's one of the huge issues with SSSS.  
edit: And if the private key is never (re)constructed, how is the public address for it generated in which to put the bitcoin in?

You need to identify the people who can lobby then. Raising money needs to have a definite end-goal.

FWIW: I'm a member. What they do I think is admirable and needed. They fund Core development, and do valuable lobbying(remember those hearings?). However, their board membership however has been quite questionable. I don't think the BF needs to be burned down, but they do need to reform the way decisions like this are being made. I'm not very strong in organizational leadership, but I think reform is a lot easier than simply "burning it to the ground".

biggest fault is asserting that Bitcoin is ready for primetime. It isn't close, and I'm not sure ever. This gets people interested, who then lose money based on basic insecurity of today's devices/systems. But that's the sin of naivety, not malice.

I was keeping you intellectually honest, and pointing out that longer term it's not as much of a problem. You are directly comparing a very low transaction volume system and a huge block reward one with a theoretically very high transaction volume with a block reward 2^(-t) smaller. 
For now, if it becomes a huge problem(it isn't yet AFAIK, transactions get in quickly with a ~5c fee), there is a couple things that could happen:  
1) Sidechains will relieve this pressure. Separate blocks mean orphan risk is only the orphaning risk of marginal transactions.  
2) If it's really crippling the system, and everyone agrees, we might decide to reduce the block reward. If it's *that* dire, anything can happen.  
I do in fact worry about this, especially as the value of BTC grows, it makes the marginal utility of the system for actual transactions harder, which is ironic.

Yeah the concern rabbit hole never ends, but the attack vector keeps getting smaller.  
Their code is open source, and firmware signed when on the device. Their code is being audited as we speak by a professional group, and the audit will be posted once completed.  
The biggest risk to me would be to pick up a fake Trezor that has a backdoor somewhere on the hardware.   
All that said, I think it's a huge step forward, and future schemes could even be more secure, with m-of-n keys, etc with little chance of simply losing keys. Right now security is a freaking nightmare, and the  reason I don't extol anyone I know to buy Bitcoin. BFL showed their own hardware prototype, but you know... BFL...

Vanilla PoS schemes have the "nothing at stake" problem, and many solutions tend to be to add a lot of complexity to make it hard to predict who is mining, punish forkers, etc. Hard to assign a dollar value of protection that provides.  
I'm open to the idea though.  
I really like this hybrid idea in the sense of the randomness is derived from the PoW mining, which then selects the PoS miners which select transactions.
@_date: 2014-08-09 12:31:33


On this point I think that's a pretty tame prediction. Disk space is still doubling, if memristors pan out space(and UTXO size) will essentially never be an issue. For bandwidth it also appears the sky is the limit. Wholesale prices for bandwidth are just falling and falling.  
I wouldn't count on it, but I also think it's not that extreme of a prediction. The only thing that wouldn't be solved is mining centralization, which is already a problem at &lt;7 tps. I assume even Gavin wishes something like Treechains+zkSNARKs fix decentralization and scaling at the same time, but I see his point of view.  
FWIW, literally no one will ever run a full node on a phone, so it's pretty stupid to try and shoot for everyone to use full clients all the time.
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:55:32
bitcoind is literally the process that runs all the consensus/networking stuff. Bitcoin Core is the entire  project in that code base, including the GUI.

Increased load will only be bandwidth, even in the worst case you present(which I don't believe anyways).  
edit: Even further, pruned nodes will be keeping a fairly large recent history, so all fairly caught up nodes will be able to grab new-ish blocks from absolutely anyone.

Not really, no. You have to trust that there isn't a 51% mining majority, but otherwise there is almost zero trust in the protocol. As long as one person is telling the truth, you'll know the current state of the system.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:36:14
Well they'd probably start tracking you using more active methods, like timing attacks(watch where transactions are coming from), correlation analysis(these outputs are spent at the same time a lot), etc.  
Casual observing would be impossible for sure.  
Much like Tor: You can use it to avoid all but the most determined adversary. Beyond that be careful!

Well conceptually the code isn't that well thought out as is. Satoshi's code was notoriously mixed up, but it's already been made a lot better.  
For example, if they want to add a new client feature that doesn't affect consensus, it's not as clear as it should be where consensus code is. If it is factored out to a library, you can basically be sure that nothing outside of it will affect consensus.

Breaks consensus. You are essentially just handing power over to miners if you don't persuade others to install the new software when you split. For example, SPV wallets will blindly follow the longest chain, as long as the headers look right.

The standard is under-defined. There are many issues that are just too general to cover. The BIP gives wallet makers a framework to structure wallets, and that only for now.  
It's recommended that you use the same software. If you can't, at least triple-check to make sure funds aren't missing. It is possible for another BIP to ensure 100% recovery of funds, but the use cases are still being worked out.

Without doing anything special, of course they'll know. But they don't know when value was sent to you. Not all transactions are 1-to-1.  
CoinJoin, and protocols like CoinShuffle, allow you to "mix" your inputs with other people. That way people can't do this surface tracking.

Let's pretend Bitcoin is very widely used, no one needs to actively game the market to not lose large amounts of value so they hold onto BTC. No one knows what will happen, because something like this has never existed.  
Let's also pretend the IRS won't go after your toaster for making pocket change renting itself out.  
If you can't pretend this far, that's fine, but no need to "rebut" these statements; they're for sake of argument.
You can do interesting things like payment channels, which cost 2x a normal transaction, but can involve many thousands of negotiated transactions a second. Metering is easy, and can be done today. No chance of a service taking significant amounts of money and "running" away with it.  
My guess the first use of this will be to monetize Tor. You can't just do that via USD.

This meaning headers-first?

"Married HD Wallets" I think they're called.  
  
"Thanks to Kosta Korenkov, we have an experimental multisig wallets implementation. Multisig (also “married”) wallets are HD wallets that are connected to a third party risk analysis service or device. When married, the wallet tracks multiple BIP32 key trees, keeps them in sync and starts vending P2SH addresses.
As part of this work, transaction signing is now pluggable. TransactionSigner implementations can be added to the wallet and will be serialized into and out of the users saved wallet file. Signers are given a transaction to sign in sequence. This is intended for risk analysis providers to provide a class that talks to their server to get a signature of the right form, so that all bitcoinj based wallets can be easily upgraded to support the new provider.:"

It's a function in the reference client that basically disallows "non-standard" transactions from being forwarded by nodes, or mined.  
They are still valid, and can get mined if you send it to Luke Jr's pool.

It's not binary.
For example, the internet isn't exactly decentralized, but it sort of is as well.  
Building special-purpose networks for miner block propagation is somewhere in between.  
OTOH I've been musing that these systems wouldn't be necessary if everyone was mining at a loss. I could see sometime in the future if 100 million people mine a bit at nearly 100% loss, essentially donating hashes. Not only would these slightly more centralized services not be necessary, but would be more resilient again double-spending attacks even if hashing power is 100% liquid.(since you'd essentially be paying per block you are re-orging)

One offers full control, while the other offers almost full control(possibility of freezing funds for ~90 days worst case) plus instant confirmation.  
That said, I tried out Bitgo and found the service kind of weird. The 3rd key is a static key, I think. Or at least it was before. It really should be another mnemonic seed to go with your other HD key series.

1) If you are on the internet, no one sends you stuff &lt; 10 min  
2) In person:  
a) You just got your picture taken for a $2 cup of coffee. Congrats?  
or  
b) You are buying an expensive item, and they'll just make you wait(or escrow, greenaddress.it's trust model, etc etc etc. Lots of these will be used for case (a) as well). No one ever said this case was "safe", even in the weak non-crypto sense.  
That said, there are many ways to make it game-theoretically safer than naked 0-conf, and I'm all for it as the space moves forward.

No I'm just saying you wouldn't have to, if you switched to a balance-based model(hard fork of course), rather than inputs-based. Full nodes would simply count up satoshis at addresses, and make sure enough is there.

The first point is flipping obvious. Your computer being compromised means all your coins are gone. Just like normal in Bitcoin.  
Second point for Circle is interesting though. Sure seems like they promised full insurance.  
edit: Reading it makes me think it's not talking about insurance at all. They are talking about "THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID CIRCLE IN THE LAST SIX (6) MONTHS".  
Meaning fees, right? You won't be given fees back in the event you aren't satisfied by their service.  
edit2: "3.6 Theft Insurance. In the event that any bitcoins held in your Circle Account are lost or stolen as a result of a direct breach of Circle’s digital or physical storage facilities your bitcoins are fully insured, subject to the terms and conditions of Circle’s insurance policy. If your bitcoins are lost or stolen as a result of your own failure to maintain proper security protocols in accordance with Section 1.3, such loss is not be covered by Circle’s insurance. You should also note that deposits are insured by a private insurance company, and not by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) or any other governmental agency."

I don't understand how people are shocked.  
It was going to happen, and should be assumed it will happen. Many people advocate for this to be the *default behavior*, as it's completely rational for miners, and would be better to treat it as such.  
All this "changes" is that you shouldn't accept high-value 0-conf txns as a sure thing.  
Just like before. The heartbeat of consensus just can't be ignored.  
(as noted elsewhere, greenaddress.it's solution of the updated "green address" model might make a lot of sense for these use cases. They won't let you double-spend at all, since they control the other key)

Outside of integrating a souped up version of p2pool into the protocol, there isn't much that can be done at protocol level, that we know of. And even that doesn't fix it, since bigger, better connected nodes inside p2pool are still superior to smaller ones.  
If you've got a new fix, please announce when the white paper is coming.  
Meanwhile for the next year or two we need to self-regulate before it crashes and burns.

I think 24 words is actually standard now in the software anyways. (it's what mine has) But assuming not, before I recover for the 2nd time I might just get another Trezor and send it over :)  (or send to a multisig wallet)

Interesting. However it appears that if one or more is using the standard client, the dominant strategy is to go along with it.  
So if you are using their standard client, the dominant strategy for the other person is to not cheat you. This puts a high risk on trying to cheat, as the only way it works is if the other person isn't following the restricted move set as well.

Post by Gavin kind of summing up the current work to make Bitcoin run better:  
1) Headers-first and pruning to make running a full node a lot faster/less intensive (very very close to being merged, at least headers-first is)   
2) IBLT, hopefully decreasing the stale risk for miners, increasing the number of transactions they will add.  
3) Increasing block size  
4) UTXO commitment 
Obviously  is the most controversial. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:42:29
My point was that it's a strange accusation that they are probably running a partial reserve when they explicitly say they are full-reserve, and the feds apparently believe it too after they've been audited as a money transmitter.  
Are people worried about Paypal or Coinbase being partial reserve? I don't think that's the worry.

We don't know how much security($/txn) we need to keep Bitcoin decentralized and secure.  
Keep in mind Amir and Peter are pushing back against those who wish it to be more mainstream via expanded blocksize. They have their own agendas, as everyone does.  
There's no reason it couldn't be cheaper than credit cards, other than concerns about centralization. These are valid concerns, but frankly not slam-dunk QED arguments.  
Wait a couple block halvings and we can start discussing how much security and decentralization we really need to get the things we want.

So the only situation is useful for is when someone shatters the PoS, instead of getting all the network on their fork it shatters consensus since new/behind nodes can't trust the blockchains they see.

This has been a fusion project I've followed for a few years called Focus Fusion.  
It's a (to the)moonshot to getting aneutronic fusion's scientific feasibility proven in the next couple of years. They are raising money for a beryllium anode, which is needed for the final proof of feasibility.  
Benefits of Focus Fusion to the crypto community if it works:  
1) Distributed power. 5MW generators are the target plant size, in quite a small package. Fuel is cheap and plentiful. Mining doesn't have to be clustered in countries with hydro!  
2) Aneutronic PB11 fusion. No nuclear waste, no carbon emissions. Very little NIMBYism!  
3) Reduces power cost 10x below coal without any subsidies, as the energy coming out is directly converted into electricity. No turbines.  
Rather than throw your bitcoin down another get quick rich scheme, take the time to read up on the science, people's critiques, and then throw some bits their way.

Read the actual thread rather than taking this title at its word.  
It's a 60 day timeout, and may be re-listed depending on what improvements have been rolled out.  
I agree the rules for admittance/exclusion should be clearer, but bc.info is by far the worst wallet listed re:security. Every other wallet that gets included today withstands a fairly long conversation back and forth about security concerns, and then get ranked overall depending on the tradeoffs.  
Can anyone of you naysayers point to a wallet listed that is *worse* in security for its class, on Android/iOS/Web?  
edit: They also run a weird old fork of bitcoind in their backend, which has led to many issues. I have no idea why people would want to run their service. Until *very* recently their client rejected P2SH txns from their mempool! I *strongly* recommend that no one use this service. Plenty of other good fish in the sea.

Public addresses are *hashes* of public keys. Spending *from* that address requires exposing the public key, so if the quantum computer is fast enough, they can intercept the payment, and change it. (regardless, a D-Wave can't do that, and never will be able to, as it's not a "traditional" quantum computer)

Because it bloats the blockchain, and miners could simply just fill it with junk, or even collude with pools to all agree to include junk, and they'll just stop propagating the junk.  
Back to square one. There is no solution to this that we know of other than decreasing propagation times of new blocks.

Adam Back is having regular discussions with Core devs and mining pool heads. We'll see what they've been saying once they company is revealed, and who is participating. 
That said, Peter Todd is working on tree chains instead. The system allows for an arbitrary number of transactions with miners mining at arbitrary difficulty levels, creating incentives to solo mine. Combined with Andrew Miller's pool-resistant PoW algorithm, it could be great. However.  
As interesting a concept it is, it's basically a shell of theory for now. None of the incentives for participating as a miner/validator have been worked out.  
Side chains would work today(plus the time to test, integrate, etc). Side chains will not solve the centralization of mining problem, and could possible make it worse. Adam Back thinks that Bitcoin should actually reduce their block size, and let other chains increase theirs(or decrease block times), since for now the block reward should be enough to incentivize decentralization. 
Further, there is absolutely no reason that they can't co-exist. If tree chains ever get figured out, Bitcoin could adapt to use it once it's battle-hardened as a side-chain. That's the beauty of side chains!

Moore's law is already dead for silicon CPUs for almost a decade. Just a matter of time before ASICs start hitting the same brick wall Intel has run into, with their billions.  
These chips are so stupid simple, the only thing to do is "multi core" to help cool the chips, which is exactly N times more expensive in capital and electricity, in the distributed case. In fact, it will start punishing cloudhashing, because of the necessary heat dissipation.  
Early days of ASIC appear to be the most centralized, and afterwards makes the network quite hardened against attack.

Changing PoW will *not make it less centralized* in the long run.  
At least not the trivial changes usually offered.  
The incentives long term are to have giant mining pools with the lowest orphan risk. That and huge mining centers as private pools.  
If you really think centralization is a problem, short term help P2Pool develop and make it easier to use, deploy, etc. (I'm not going to sit around and pray for something like this)  
Long term better pray that something like Peter Todd's tree chains actually gets figured out, including incentives etc, and deployed.

Really depends on the false-positive rate properties.  
Bloom filters in Bitcoin are used precisely because it can give a false positive rate, obscuring the addresses you control in SPV clients.  
edit: Being able to delete items could be a killer app at least  
edit2: Cuckoo takes more data per item when we want error rates above 3%. I don't think it's very useful for SPV clients then, unless being able to remove items is worthwhile. Oh well.

These systems are putting band-aids on gushing wounds, imo.  
They add slight difficulty to forging chains, but nothing that can stop them.  
the worst thing to me is that in PoS, private keys with no worth gain worth! If someone spends their NXT at one time, they don't care about their old keys anymore. They can sell them(or get them stolen) to do a time-reversing attack that uses these keys to do staking.  
No way to detect this as an outsider.

That's why, if you've been listening to anyone who talks about remittances, there must be flows of money in and out. It isn't enough today to send someone Bitcoin, there must be buyers of Bitcoin on the other end. Places like Argentina might fit that bill, with the poor receiving money, and the rich hiding theirs(or sending it abroad for investment in more investment-friendly locals).

If you integrated it directly into the p2p layer of bitcoind(I assume this is what you mean), it could open up possible DoS issues.

The difference being you'd be taking a radically centralized fix and foisting it upon the core consensus mechanism. 
(and also the fact that it indeed ended up being the longest chain that was winning, just through social pressure) 
Maybe distributed consensus ala Bitcoin is impossible. But throwing out the baby isn't the answer.  
With no SPV mechanism, that means everyone will run full nodes(or just completely trust some centralized service). Most people will just trust the bc.info of their day, even if they are running a notoriously inaccurate fork of the main client. This is *already* a problem in Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-06-25 03:04:00
It possibly opens up a weird game theoretical problem.  
Another idea: If you forward just a header, another "losing" miner is tempted to not forward your actual block contents, not until they find their own block and forward their stupidly-small block that will beat yours. It makes block propagation possibly adversarial, a lot more than it already is.  
Maybe? Thoughts?

Don't worry about addresses very much. They are cheaply generated and disposed of. Just don't delete private keys!!! Private keys are the *only* thing you need to spend your coin. No registration etc needed.

This stuff had been discussed on the dev mailing list for a while now, because everyone is concerned that we won't even hit 1MB blocks the rate we are going unless fees start going way up.  
Haven't actually read the research he/gmaxwell/others cited, but should be interesting.  
I think the important think to note is the mining infrastructure has completely split off from the rest of the ecosystem, and they are finally being treated differently. No one but miners care about slight slow down in propagation times(well, we do now that block sizes have peaked and fees are climbing...), so we should be engineering them separately.  
For example, miners aren't worried about privacy leaks when it comes to what transactions they include. They can share with other miners all the live long day and it's only to their benefit.

Must re-post:
“Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience. They may be more likely to go to Heaven yet at the same time likelier to make a Hell of earth. This very kindness stings with intolerable insult. To be "cured" against one's will and cured of states which we may not regard as disease is to be put on a level of those who have not yet reached the age of reason or those who never will; to be classed with infants, imbeciles, and domestic animals.”

If the miner themselves aren't doing the SHA256 work on the entire block header, who is? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of mining, since the *only* thing that matters in the end is the hash of the entire header?

The txn fee right now is mostly paying the miners because they're afraid of losing block reward.  
If we get O(1) propagation of blocks, then it will just be auctioning for space on blocks. This will be a function of block size vs demand. No one know what that will be.

Rather than pushing everything off-blockhain(pretty damned lazy and already done via Circle/Coinbase), we need to figure out how to make it scale while staying decentralized.  
We can scale up Bitcoin pretty easily, but comes at cost of decentralization. We might be ok with a mining oligarchy. Maybe it's enough to get almost all the benefits of cryptocurrency. Or maybe not. Impossible to say, but it makes it much more risky.
Treechains are the first attempt I know of that attempts to both scale and re-decentralize crypto-currency. Still a half-baked idea, but it's an important discussion and research.
@_date: 2014-08-28 16:45:11
SPV has less security, as it just has header of blocks to verify the speciic transaction is in the longest known chain.  
Since you don't have blocks, you need to ask full nodes for blocks with your transactions in them. This leaks information, reducing privacy.

As long as they don't neuter the protocol and don't stop people from innovating, it could possibly do what the internet did for information.

You are correct.

@_date: 2014-08-13 11:47:03
The fee per txn has very little to do with PoW. It has to do with the block reward, which PoS coins would have the same issue with.  
People will mine when it's in their self-interest, and quit when it's not. Not rocket surgery. And we're not the ones paying for it, miners are.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:19:11


Wait, you paid $600 for 1BTC in September?  
Your only real complaint is security.  
1) Wait, what? It literally only takes a few seconds to be verified. If it's a big ticket item you'll have to wait a few minutes for a confirmation, but it's the same exact risk with credit card chargebacks, except in 10 minutes the merchant will be 99.999% sure it won't be reversed rather than weeks. User experience only sucks today due to lack of payment smoothness, has nothing to do with the protocol. POS, payment protocol enhancements will basically get rid of this issue in less than a year.  
2) This is the real concern. Trezor-like devices and m-of-n escrow will be necessary for mass adoption, and it may end up still being too difficult for grandma. Won't stop Bitcoin from potentially changing the world in other ways, much like Linux has.  
3) I'm sorry, I feel for people, but the lesson was necessary. It will hopefully be the last painful lesson of that scope.
 
4) The day Bitcoin adds "consumer protection" by allowing some random dude to steal money back I will sell all my coin. If you've been in the Bitcoin scene that long and never heard about escrow, that really boggles. It's programmable money.   
p.s. I'll buy that Trezor off you when it comes in for the actual historical USD price you paid.

Check out greenaddress.it's green address model.  
Out of channel the service tells the merchant that they own 1 of the 2 keys in order to spend, and they promise to not double-spend on their end. Adds a bit of trust at the expense of possibly getting your money frozen(nlocktime txn allows you to get back your money if they disappear though).  
All this is done using HD wallets, using new addresses for each txn.

What's interesting is that I'm quite amenable to the idea, but dev mailing list aren't, apparently for the "people could send bad headers" argument. That by itself is utterly unconvincing. If their "attack" is to waste an incredible amount of electricity, then get lucky and only delay the next block, they must be applauded for their stupidity.  
Maybe a temptation of miners would be to hold onto the block headers longer and longer, fearing that they just missed out on the block content somehow, and they'll get it later.
I'd have to think through the cases more carefully, but I'm assuming smarter people have already done this?

There's no good way, no. Miners can just fill up blocks with blank data essentially.  
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:43:16
Yes it is. The larger the block, the more connectedness to pools is important, giving an edge to giant mining pools. This is further exacerbated by short block times, as it increases the amount of blocks that go to the highly-connected victor.

@_date: 2014-07-31 19:07:10
Sort of.  
Caveats:  
- The sub-branches probably won't have different confirmation times, so you're stuck with whatever confirmation times of the various branches being all the same (at least it's not obvious how to do otherwise). The improvement in mining decentralization may allow faster confirmation times, although it's questionable how much bloat this will cause since you have 2^(num layers) chains to keep track of.(and you have to at least pay attention to headers)
- The coins embedded in the system must use SHA256/whatever PoW is being used at the root.  
Each coin must agree to use the basic cryptoledger(proof of publication and ordering of data). Beyond that you can do anything you'd like.

@_date: 2014-03-10 13:39:56
One can not "fix" the wait in confirmations, unless you are willing to increase risk/trust.  
I think the future is going to be people using more centralized solutions for day to day spending, but when it comes to larger purchases/storage of wealth/assets, things will get put back onto the blockchain. Off-chain will still be denominated in BTC of course.  
Perhaps something like Open Transactions will give us a good middle-ground between centralization and decentralization, speed/cost and security.

One of two reasonable interpretations:

I should just make a blog post or copypasta for this question, been asked a million times and there's no good digest anywhere :)  
Idea is: Allow people to propagate unconfirmed double-spends. So if I'm trying to steal back my coffee money, I send out a double-spend. You as the merchant detects it, and "burn" the btc by sending ALL the btc he sent you with his first transaction to a miner as miner fee. The greedy miners will pick this sequence instead of the double-spending transaction to include in a block.  
The thief still keeps their coffee, but doesn't get to keep any of his ill-gotten btc.  
Makes it not worth it to risk possible jail-time and whatnot for no gain.

Weird meaning they did their own stuff to it, old meaning &lt;0.9. AFAICT it's not open-source.


I yelled at them online for months to fix this, because I couldn't even *send* my funds out of my bc.info wallet to a P2SH address. I had to send it to the Schildbach(sp?) wallet first, since that's an actual functioning wallet that runs on open-source code. They finally fixed this issue a couple of months ago.  


Nope. Just someone upset at a wallet provider sitting on their laurels and not taking criticism seriously. Now that they are being de-listed suddenly they are going to be transparent and update some of their flaws.  
edit: For example, people railing on their SharedCoin is from this thread:   
It's from a serious group of researchers, and BC.info never deigned it necessary to respond, AFAICT. Threatening them apparently gets the details out.

@_date: 2014-07-15 14:10:05
It's just frustrating that the ecosystem is captured by a wallet that doesnt understand addresses that have been around for a couple years now.  
1) You can't send to/from a P2SH address using their wallet  
2) Their mempool doesn't recognize P2SH spends either, so it won't show up until after it gets in a block. I use other websites to track that now.
@_date: 2014-07-19 14:16:41

Generally when discussing fantastical futures we can assume the block reward is nearly approaching zero.  
Keeping mining/block sharing decentralized at those tps is of course... doubtful.  
edit: I did just reason out why miners probably shouldn't mine on top of headers only: It would encourage people to continue to mine block headers, even if people don't end up coughing up the blocks eventually. Maybe? Have to think about this more.
@_date: 2014-01-13 13:34:32
If he just means "idiots will no longer day-trade for useless copycats" then he's certainly wrong. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 10:24:43
Of course. The miners would have no idea what's in the block until they see it, so they'll simply start mining empty blocks until they get the block content. Totally missed that. Longer-term that's even worse as a large mining pool will get a good transaction fee edge compared to others, since they can mine on top of their full block, not just the header.  
Even if this mine on header thing works, it's actually quite damning of shorter-block times.

If you believe that people getting hurt will bring on regulation, then indeed it's going to happen regardless, because people are  morons.  
We can try and educate people to not be morons, and that may help, but certainly won't stop it.  
The best we can do is argue that mining is a neutral activity, much like we can't sue the sun for not shining a particular day(or can we?). People can take the risk with 0-conf(or planting a crop), but have no legal recourse against nature.  
We can of course try and pursue legal recourse on the ends of the transactions, dealing with the fraud.

I don't think you read it.  
Just means there is an theoretical inefficiency in choosing which transactions to mine to maximize profit.  
And this only matters if miners are actually filling blocks.  
Unless some miner constructively proves P=NP everyone should be fine.

Is there a walkthrough on someone doing these things?
It's not immediately obvious the best way to go about it and interact with people on github. I feel like there is a large on-ramp missing at that point.  
For example, how would one have properly helped test the auto-prune code?

Please use the search tool. It's asked every week.  
It's probably KnC private pool, which left Eligus, and CloudHashing, which owns the address being tied to many of the payments.  
For example, the biggest unknown IP points to some addresses, one being:

Perhaps not that one, because the malicious device could feed GA.it a bad wallet chain that you don't control, freezing your btc.  
When they do 2-of-3 signing(in the works), that could work. You keep one seed offline on paper unless you need to retrieve your funds.

Using a new data structure and communication protocol, we could make the marginal latency of block propagation when adding transactions to  O(1).  
This means miners would be much more likely to add transactions of low fees to blocks than today. (theoretically they would max out the block at 1MB, sorting by transaction fee)

ASICS are *not the problem*. If they've figured out how to make mining decentralized, they should really tell Peter Todd, because it isn't actually solved yet.  
It's a scam. Period.
Even if you somehow get rid of ASICs forever(I'd venture impossible), you'd still have to deal with people who specialize in mining servers. They'll make data centers, just like they're doing now for regular web services to dissipate heat. It won't be any more "democratic" once these mining operations take off because people will have to pool to compete.

That said: If you don't know what you're doing, don't buy any. It's an extremely early beta. It could crash at any moment.

Should be good. Link to his UniqueBits thing he hacked together:   
update: It's interesting how he tied his distrust of SPV to sidechains. I think the jury is still out on sidechains, etc, but it's not clear what the sociological tradeoffs are.  
For instance, it's my contention that a lack of SPV essentially dooms most people to use the "fully trust" clients as the blockchain expands in size. Running a full node on any system will only be the domain of crypto geeks, professionals, and hobbyists.
Sidechains are clearly not as secure as Bitcoin main, but no one has ever said otherwise. Perhaps it gives things people need, better than alternatives? Maybe it will fundamentally harm Bitcoin via incentives? Hard to say. 
Caution is warranted either way.

Well yes if you completely reject the premise it doesn't work, but that's not the point of a mental exercise. 
IF people are ok losing small amounts of money mining.  
IF mining hardware becomes nearly 100% a commodity. (an ASIC chip is quite simple, and 100% parallelizable)
Then my results, or even some weaker version *could* hold. 
Of course if the only miners out there are $2.5k+(and deprecating fast) and people care about profits and pool this doesn't work. But that wasn't the premise.  No one is saying that would work today, or even in a couple of years.  
You do know that there is no such thing as "cereal mining chips", right? ;)

It most certainly does not. The initial ASIC rush means that only people who get their hands on the latest hottest ASICs can compete. This tends to favor vertically-integrated setups or huge pools to reduce variance before your ASIC deprecates.  
With the difficulty slowing its climb to Moore's law-ish levels, it's not nearly so bad. Still not to "ASIC in cereal box" levels, but getting much better.

Anything particular you would like ?

You mean if they have manipulated the app? (I'm assuming the 2nd key is made on the user's device) That's true, but hard to solve this in a seamless/easy fashion. Their app is open source too, which makes it harder. 
I was thinking last night: We need a standard hosted hot wallet interface for multisig. A universal open source app that generates your safe keys, and then interfaces with a service of your choice that hosts your 2nd factor keys, and allows things like rate-limiting, fraud detection, etc. At the phone/device-side, there isn't that much that *has* to be done, other than general key management.  
This way, websites just work on making your 3rd set of keys(user keeps their own 2, one in a safe deposit) safe from hackers, and interesting safety features like rate limiting.

But the GUI has nothing to do with the spec. It doesn't decide which transactions are forwarded/mined. Bitcoind is what everyone regression tests on.

So let's say I mined a block, and Ghash.io mined a different block at *exactly* the same time.  
My internet connection is slower than theirs, so everyone else starts mining on top of GHash.io's block. If they find a subsequent block before I do, my block is "left behind", just like an orphan. Hence orphan block.

Part of understanding the danger of doing a 1 minute targeted block time is to think "why can't it be 1 second"?  
Decreasing block times gives you:  
1) More block header overhead  
2) Higher orphan rate  
3) Chance of deeper re-orgs  
4) Stresses the importance of networking infrastructure rather than hash power (less secure to attacks)
However there are obviously positive reasons as well:  
1) Psychologically easier on humans  
2) Gives us better block statistics per difficulty period  
3) Smaller pools get less variance on payouts.  
According to some experts, today, 2 minute block times would be pretty safe. Still a very low orphan rate, and would give us the positive effects mentioned above. Maybe even 1 minute would be safe.  
Still, the negatives are *huge* if incorrectly diagnosed, and most people focus on the psychology point only, which is frankly not very exciting since there are other methods of making it faster.  
For part 2, you can *not* assume everyone has the same clock. In fact there are incentives for people to lie about their clock! If we could agree on ordering, we don't need PoW at all!

This is extremely exciting. Core devs and Adam Back being financed to make improvements to Bitcoin much easier! 
Since Adam Back spoke on LTB, I've been thinking non-stop about the pegging idea. 
It preserves the scarcity that Bitcoin provides, while allowing many different networks to arise. 
Looks like they are seriously moving in this direction. 
Benefits: 
1) Allows Bitcoin Core devs to do safe upgrading of Bitcoin Core. They could build a "Beta" network. Bitcoin has shown that upgrading is extremely hard, and made me doubt the future of any cryptocurrency. This solves that in an elegant way. 
2) Allows people to implement their own ideas, while using the hashrate and support of the vanilla Bitcoin ecosystem. So if someone comes up with a good alternative to the blockchain that scales, they can test it out without risking the entire network. 
Want a 3-minute confirmation block chain? Bam. 1 minute? Bam. As long as you can convince mining pools to merge-mine your chain, it's possible. 
This can change *everything* about cryptocurrency.

There's been some good discussion on the bitcointalk thread:  
  
to me there are really only 2 valid criticisms of block size increase:  
1) Raises barrier to mining entry: Each miner MUST agree 100% to the canonical history of transactions. They can't simply say "these 10% look good". It's like requiring that any mobile carrier startup must take on the same load as AT&amp;T immediately to even compete in the space.  (which makes sharding/sidechains/treechains attractive!)
and the corollary:  
2) Makes it easier to censor and/or control mining.

Hard to say exactly. Just bring it up whenever possible, and explain why it will actually lead to more secure 0-conf(for those small populations who need it) and easier to use software.

A signed transaction could just simply never be sent anywhere, or delayed on purpose.  
We have to be exact in our language so people don't lose money :)  
GreenAddress.it in fact pre-signs a transaction you can't get in the blockchain for 90 days as a refund mechanism. So you aren't "sending" it anywhere until it gets in a block.
@_date: 2014-04-16 12:26:07
I don't know about making any sort of legal/moral argument for/against this. Blocks or not, fraud is based on the intent of the action, whether it's 0-conf, or 3 blocks deep.  
If someone comes into my store, sends off BTC to pay, then submits another payment *intentionally* that gets into a block before the first one, I'd consider that person a thief and fraudster.  
edit: I re-read, you are asking about miners being in a conspiracy. Ah, I agree with you there. While I think it's pretty sketchy to host a service like this(you just want to cancel accidental payments, uh-huh), it's totally within their bounds to do so. It's the fraudster's problem. I'd much rather it be a decentralized solution for double-spending.

It's a ~$6B cap. There's barely any wealth in it compared to just about any tiny industry.

You can trivially just increase block sizes, or decrease block times, or a mixture of the two.  
This does result in less decentralization, all things equal.

Story example:

Price of BTC doubles.  
I come back, demand my money back and return fridge.  
How is this sustainable? You let go of your BTC at the current *market price*.

It is being done, but not a sole focus. There are a lot of important features within reach that will make the network more robust.  
Anyhoo, in order to clean up the code, first the code must be disentangled, primary of which is the consensus code and wallet code.  
Once that is completed I think non-consensus-related code can be changed more quickly.

Nodes will be getting easier to run very soon(v.10+).  
1) Syncing is way way faster. On my sluggish old laptop it syncs the entire blockchain in &lt;8 hours. This is due to headers-first syncing acting more like bittorrent than before.  
2) Pruning. Lets you pick the amount of space you are willing to give to store the blockchain, and it gets rid of the oldest blocks beyond that amount.   
There is no reason to suspect we need to directly incentivize nodes yet.

I think you're missing the point. Miners will mine for any incentive they have to mine.  
They could all agree that mining rewards them with FunBux, and would continue to do so. You don't "need" bitcoin the unit per se.

If the transaction was broadcast, there should be no issue eventually. Some miner will pick it up.

Even if you think regulations in the end would be a good thing, it'd be a very bad idea to institute them now, as new(superior) techniques will most likely be developed in the very near future, and regulations are extremely slow to adapt.  
Give the ecosystem another 10 years *at least* before you slow it down with regulations.

That's not quite true. All users of the system vote on consensus. Doesn't matter if GHash starts including "give us a million BTC" blocks, users will reject these, even if it's the longest chain.  
The only unilateral power they have is deciding the ordering of transactions that everyone else agree are valid. (basically no one will deny these except for selfish miners I suppose)

BetaCoin, imo, is the only real way forward. Without it, development of very basic upgrades that require hard forks will take years, and risk the integrity of the network.  
To poorly paraphrase Peter Todd(I think?): Updating Bitcoin is like repairing a 747, in mid-flight. We need a more systematic approach.  
As far as getting more developers? I'm sorry, funding any and all development using "bounties" means that you will get people doing stuff on their free time, or those who don't have mouths to feed. Gavin et al have to use some of their Bitcoin wealth to hire people full time.

I've tried to trace one by hand. Couldn't do the first iteration in 10 minutes. I don't think it's doing 1-to-1. I think it merges a number of inputs from each user, and gives the same value out split up in random amounts.  
Probably not hard to crack with a program(the number of combinations isn't that large, and outputs are all different sizes), but I couldn't do it by eye.

True enough. They claim 256 bits off hardware alone, which should be sufficient.

Im not convinced that mining on headers is still the best idea. 
It'd be a great way to ease the problem of miners producing small blocks, and would make transactions cheaper. 
I'd start with exploring that first. 
I guess my point is, we can't understand the effects until we put changes into play. If we are having issues with mining centralization at 10 minute block times, I'd be hesitant to make 5 second ones.

I'm not a PoS proponent, but you can have a derived stake key that isn't your key that controls your coin.  


In general miners have the money/access to ASICs, which isn't any more egalitarian.
There are many other issues with PoS of course:  
1) Costless simulation(nothing at stake)  
2) No SPV mode  
3) Checkpointing essentially required

We can argue but I still prefer paper. You can do BIP0038 encryption, and fragmented backups, so it can't be stolen or easily destroyed.

Investors and vendors have a huge incentive. Mining consolidation is the big worry, not lack of full nodes. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 12:47:12
Yes, possibly.  
Originally it was set to 10 minutes to avoid orphan blocks.  
Made a lot of sense when bootstrapping the network, since only a few people were mining over un-optimized block sharing networks. Now there are many miners, all using low-latency connections between each other.  
Some recent research suggests that moving towards a 2 minute blocktime would actually increase decentralization, since it would make small pools just as profitable as large pools.  
However, we don't know the secondary and tertiary effects of changing the block times, so it will take much debate to do so. I, for one, think that if we need to increase the transactions per second to something higher than 7, we should first think to do so by slowly decreasing the block time instead of increase block size. At least to the 2 minute mark.

Effortless fork means it can't achieve distributed consensus.  
If the PoW portion of the algorithm is small, it just means reversing a ton of blocks is a small amount of energy. Or it has to use centralized checkpointing.  
Maybe checkpointing is ok for everyone and gets us most of the benefits of cryptocurrency, but it's certainly not decentralized. I think we could a lot more efficient if we just dropped the whole notion of decentralization, but it comes at a price of course.

No need to "cancel". Miners will eventually forget the transaction, and you can send another one in its place.  
In the future hopefully(I think some miners already do this!) you can just immediately send another payment with higher txn fee, and the miners will include that one.  
This is called "replace-by-fee", btw. Many people are pushing for this to happen.

Yes you only need 1 copy of your keys to spend your coin. If you have your backup still, you're ok, even if you wiped both devices again.

Entropy, especially with multisig paper wallets, will allow you to do fairly secure storage. I stress multisig because if you do 1 of 1, whenever you scan that wallet, if your device is hacked, you're screwed.

1) There is a psych effect, on two levels:  
a) We can't deal well with many leading zeroes. It's a fact. This is the bigger issue. We can deal with numbers starting with non-leading zeroes and commas.  
b) It's bad publicity in the short term, because people literally do believe there are only 21 million tokens. Why is better marketing a bad idea? Should we stick to the obtuse notions just because? In that case let's move to MegaBTC, because lol scammy pump and dump!!!  
  
2) Financial software, among many other money software, assume two decimal places. Guess what denomination lines up with 2 decimal places, now and forever*. *assuming Bitcoin isn't so wildly successful we need more places, which you and I probably don't believe.  
  
3) You conflate pump and dumpers here on with the entire reason for the push. Other than the fact that this ignores everyone else, in fact, many here thought it was a bad idea to move to mBTC, and wanted to go to uBTC, for the same exact reasons listed above.  
FWIW, I actually use mBTC for now, because I only really have to deal with ~2 decimal places to get a good sense of the value. If bitcoin drops in price 10x, it doesn't even matter for readability.

From skimming the thread, the reasoning is that they are non-standard, and takes 3 minutes to verify, meaning 3 minutes to forward at each node. Would take a really long time to propagate, and most pools would reject it.
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:41:00
If that's the case, we should see hashrates drop, or at least the growth slow down as older, less efficient mining equipment is shut off.  
Pool consolidation doesn't have much to do with that.
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:05:06
there's possible failure modes where miners continually mine on longest chain even if the block itself is lost.

It'll never be completely free, unless you take it off-chain. Depending on the blocksize/rate and demand for blocks it could be competitive/better than other payment networks on-chain. Once/If O(1) propagation of new blocks is achieved we should see lower fees.   
Regardless, there needs to be fee to do spam control.  
It can be made instant in a few ways, with little risk.  
Scorched Earth with replace-by-fee and 2-of-2 instant confirmation like GreenAddress.it are two interesting ways.

SharedCoin appears to be slightly better than it was before. Still, some basic algorithmic matching would be able to figure it out.  
And of course they could be keeping logs.  
That said, I'm there with you. They are a web-based wallet which could change their code at any time and lose/steal your money. It's a terrible security model, and their code is often broken.

You can do watch-only addresses, if that's what you mean.
@_date: 2014-09-25 01:32:45
Intimately for historical reasons. P2SH means the address is made using the script itself. Multi SIG were too large before, as you had to store all the valid public keys in the transaction. Now you only need to put those in when spending from that address. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:09:29
I don't worship PoW, I just think it's by far the best mechanism we have.  
Anything that allows disagreement *even when both sides are following the same rule sets* seems inherently dangerous for consensus. PoW is just "less broken" imo. I think any system that doesn't allow trustless bootstrapping will end up in BlockchainInfoCoin tears.
FWIW I like your(I think it's yours) PoA scheme that mixes PoW/PoS much better than any pure PoS scheme. 
p.s. Do you know the current extent of work on SPV for PoS systems? (I suppose in Vit's model you'd just simply trust your friends' UTXO set... who prob got it from bc.info ... centralization ahoy).  
For PoA can you use the PoW chain as a quasi-SPV, with the associated deprecation in security due to lack of PoS information?
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:05:59
I disagree that it's hand-wavy. It's something that can be empirically tested, and will be(I believe that's in the road-map for this project).  
You could mine directly on top of headers if we were ok getting rid of SPV clients, such as in Peter Todd's treechains.  
And remember you can verify transactions ahead of time, meaning block verification should be(I think?) only O(|B-P|) + hashing the block. So again, if our previous assumptions about mempools are correct, this should be O(1).  
Am I wrong here? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 19:57:02

Of course it happens with alts. But Bitcoin isn't an alt.   
*Theoretically* anything could happen, sure, but it's not going to happen(modulo Bitcoin dying in some other way first). I'd put BTC where my mouth is but if it crashes it means nothing to you. :)  
Mining pools will still be abusive regardless, as we've seen with GHash. Bitcoin has a lot of potential ways of demising, but 51% attack is frankly far down on my list.

His theoretical numbers may be slightly off, but he's right.  
1 billion people mining at a pure loss of 1 cent per day (assuming ASIC architectures are all the same, obviously not true today but could be close in future as we hit physical maximums), this would lead to $3.65B in mining protection of the network a year, or about $68k per block.  
Ridiculous scenario? Almost surely. But maybe some people are ok with losing more than a cent a day. I would be fine losing much more than $3.65 a year. 
Even better: people mining at a loss protects against long-term re-orgs! Even if they take the block-reward/fees, they will still be losing money.

Funny article though:  
"Few of the Bitcoin promoters I’ve questioned are involved in the deeper aspects of the liberty movement, Constitutional activism, sound money, self-defense and so on. Almost none of them had a preparedness plan, few of them had experience with precious metals, none of them owned firearms, and none of them had any inclination to build local networks for mutual aid. Worst of all, many of them had no understanding of the wider threat of economic collapse that America faces today. In fact, when the possibility of full-spectrum collapse is brought up, many Bitcoiners respond with the same brand of shallow dismissals that one would expect from the Paul Krugmans and Ben Bernankes of the world. - See more at:

To be honest Bitcoin has never been more decentralized than it is now.

I've said this a lot. If they were serious, they'd have some formula that penalizes miners as they(the pool, not the individual miner) get too many blocks. A slowly increasing fee is a great idea, until they go back down to ~30%.

I'm not a crypto god, but you can essentially do some one-way function on your key, right? Where the signature is "linked" to the public key of your private key, in a similar way as your private to public.  
So your private key can be held off-line(can't move funds without this one), and your staking key held in the hot computer.  
I was told this by nullc or someone I trust in these matters. Wish I knew more on the technical details.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:31:56

Right, I totally understand and am with you, but it's smart to think through *all* the attack vectors.  
FWIW I'm the most impressed with your service out of all the other hosted wallets so far. Really easy and appears to be extremely safe.

Ignoring the whole debate about achieving consensus, one big issue with PoS is that (as far as we know) there is no way to do SPV clients.

@_date: 2014-09-24 20:42:47
I can't respond quite yet to it, since I haven't actually re-cached everything, but regarding:  


People like me are worried about really nasty failure modes where people just continually mine on top of headers only, even if a block was invalid.  
edit: I think he's suggesting that the "reliability" of a particular transaction being propagated is not dependent on the size of the block. Transactions aren't dropped/missed due to scale of system. Each mining pool is very well connected to the rest already, and transactions are flooded. Empirically speaking I think this is true.  
If different pools have a very different view of the network, then yeah you'd be right. He's making those assumptions.
@_date: 2014-10-06 12:49:09
Bad idea since a bittorrent is more like a checkpoint.  
Headers-first downloading is coming really soon. After that is implemented, full nodes will get SPV-style security very quickly, and then can download full blocks in parallel with many peers without security risks. So it'll sort of be like bittorrent, except just using the p2p network to grab blocks in a swarm.  
@_date: 2014-11-04 14:50:22

I don't think you get standard SPV security.  
You can download the block headers, but you can't assume miners validated ColoredCoin transactions before putting them in.
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:15:43
You'd have to force everyone to P2SH transactions for everything, and switch to a ledger balance model. Let's rate this unlikely in the near term.  
Most likely off-chain transactions make more sense. If you're doing lots of $1 donations, it isn't really that dangerous to trust someone with the coin temporarily. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:18:04

@_date: 2014-09-22 15:37:02


Any full node can verify, or "validate" the transaction. Miners are "burying" the transactions in the blockchain.

A less populated, but more serious sub, is   
For example I haven't seen this story: 
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:38:22
Just cribbing from what Trezor does:
1) if stolen, thief needs pin. Device exponentially backs off with each failed attempt. (While he tries this you can recover from seed and move funds)
2) if act of god explodes it, use the backup seed that you locked away in a safe, encrypted with bip0032. 
Not perfect by any means, but pretty damned good considering it doesn't depend on others helping out.

Not to say that's not a good idea, but it might be low on the list of priorities.  
A user would have to manually check that it's been changed, or use software, which would then in turn be checked to make sure that hasn't been tampered with.  
I might be wrong. Could you point me to anyone that is using the time-stamping nature of the blockchain to show security of code?
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:59:11
Because mining is supposed to provide security in the form of hashing. If they're outcompeting purely due to scaling of their connectivity and other computing concerns, it does nothing for anyone else.

I really hope the hard-wired addresses isn't true or is changed. At least allow people to pick pools if they're going to blindly hash.

Aside from the dependency on merged mining with no block subsidy, of course.  
From what I understand, there's some possibility for miners to steal coins, not just reverse payments(I'm assuming dealing with the proof being sent back and forth). This true?

Indeed.  
We can do trust-less things, as well as reintroduce trust, with any group we'd like:  
1) Secure hardware wallets, like Trezor  
2) Multisig where you keep keys on separate devices  
3) Multisig where a trusted service holds a key set  (essentially off-loading the "separate" device requirement)
It'll be a spectrum of security in the end, only trusting those you voluntarily choose to.

People actually seemed to respond, and the max sized pool became drastically smaller.  
For a while no pools were above 24%.  
Discus is 27% today. Ghash, the menace, is down to 17%.
  
This is actually quite healthy. With pools less than 33% lots of of incentives for bad behavior go away or are drastically reduced.

I think you can always generate your own BIP0039 mnemonic offline and "recover" it in GA.it client if you don't trust the client to give the right amount of entropy. Is that what you mean?

If you lose your PGP key, or get it stolen, you're screwed. In Bitcoin land we have native multisig. 
There is discussion of multi-sig PGP, which is certainly possible, but AFAIK hasn't been done.  
I think more importantly is that Bitcoin necessitates safe crypto, which is leading to things like Trezor, which makes secure logins much easier and safer.

If we can't apply pressure to self-regulate because it's "anti-bitcoin", then we should never be able to start a thread on the topic, because that's "anti-bitcoin" too apparently. Complete poppycock. We can/will/should pressure mining pools in any way we can, outside of violence. It's not even changing the protocol, it's admitting that the direct financial incentives are wrong, and responding.

If you're using a computer that connects to the internet, a simple trojan will clean you out,

$5 wrench attack is predicated on us taking more than $5 from him :)
@_date: 2014-04-07 12:55:25
The issue is that Bitcoin can not spend partial outputs.  
In a Bitcoin transaction, you must define where *all the BTC goes*. Of the total amount, what you don't send to someone goes to the miner.  
So if I have 2 BTC in a paper wallet/address(from one output), and try and send 1 BTC to a candy shop, and don't define another 1 BTC destination that I control, this is donated to a miner. For some reason some software wallets let you send directly from a paper wallet without sending the rest to a change address. (normall the mining fee/change address is handled automatically) 
The function you'll want is "sweep", which just takes all the BTC from the wallet address and puts it into addresses you own in the software wallet.

This to me is the biggest risk. It would probably have to be something like:

2) SHA256 is rapidly broken, far too fast to replace it. Extremely unlikely, imo.

Great comment.  
I'm not actually concerned about how effective the BF are in their goals, they've been quite successful(hiring 3+ full-time devs, lobbying politicians to make sure it isn't strangled in it's crib), but by far the biggest drawbacks are it's confused voting structure, and transparency.  
It'd be much better if people stopped trying to do everything at once and instead do one thing well. Maybe make an org that is able to fund full time developers. Then make another to do lobbying, etc. And please stop trying to push a mystical DAO. They don't exist yet, even the simplest ones.

Sounds like a single point of failure to me. One device hacked and you're screwed.  
The scenario doesn't even have to hijack the UI. All it needs to do is send its own fake transaction at the same time you think you're sending the real one. That's not too crazy a scenario.
The only thing this seems to buy is if your device is *moderately* screwed.
@_date: 2014-11-26 15:47:02
Exactly.  
1 billion people mining *1 cent a day* gives us a *huge* security margin.  
The question is if we can convince a large amount of people to sacrifice a tiny amount of energy for a greater good voluntarily. 
edit: In fact this setup makes PoW *way* more robust than even today, as attempting a re-org will net you negative BTC! Block reward + fees will be less than the energy you spend, which isn't necessarily true today.
One question that isn't answered is how people will mine with it. Will they just point it to mega-poolA, or actually run a full node, or point to p2pool? All unanswered sociological questions. But these are the *same questions* PoS-style systems face too.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:49:41
I want a pool that is setup more as a lottery. People can plug in their ASIC usb sticks, and get some of the benefits of pooling, including not having to store the entire blockchain, as well as some variance reduction, but the variance is kept quite high, such that payouts happen like a lottery.  
Something like .01/.1/1/10 BTC payouts depending on what the miner wants to risk in variance.

@_date: 2015-05-31 13:00:33
Well if you guys really want this, everyone on need to buy some serious miners, and start mining on p2pool, like Gregory does. At a small loss.  
Seriously. I'm not kidding. A bunch of people running their own full nodes and mining semi-serious amounts would do wonders for decentralization.  
Unfortunately, collective action is hard, incentives are mis-aligned, and here we are :/  
(I don't think mining is a lost cause forever. Lots of smart people thinking about improving the mining "game", and low-cost miners are finally making an entrance with 21.inc. Perhaps in 5 years this will be completely different. And even then, you have to remember that miners need to actually run a full node themselves to have full power!)

More connected/larger pools/miners have the propagation/processing/storage advantage.

@_date: 2014-06-02 14:17:38
The biggest issue with making it shorter is the possibility of a cheap difficulty attack.  
Someone could fire up ASICs, at a loss, for a short period of time, making a bunch of blocks, then shut them off, making the block time extremely slow.  
Two weeks makes this attack quite expensive. Maybe a week is fine too, or even shorter, but there is a tradeoff.
@_date: 2014-04-10 12:07:31
I'm wondering if there's a way to "tax" the side chain, to create another block reward.  
Either way, it'll be very interesting. The marginal cost to mining these chains will be quite small, and without a block reward I think the fees needed won't be that high. Who knows.

Plenty of people have read the code. If people want a formal audit, they probably should ask for one, since people are going to use paper wallets in the absence of secure machines. This is the most popular website by far, so it'd be a good place to start.  
I'm 100% sure it's been subjected to attackers, due to the vast amount of wealth being protected by it. Whether it ends up being as secure as it can get, I dunno.

He's saying that instead of Colored Coin on top of blockchain, they would release ColoredChain, a blockchain that is built *only* to service colored coins. It would be built much smarter(more compact, efficient, and expressive), and miners/wallets wouldn't be forced to sift through the data or propagate the information if they don't want.  
The could even release a CounterPartyChain, which still runs on BTC, but has the power necessary to implement bets using their own scripting language.  
If this goes through, expect almost all Bitcoin 2.0 projects to crash, as there is no need for them, unless you don't think you can convince miners to merge mine your system(which doesn't speak highly of your system).

Miners will be forced to validate some sort of base BTC layer to make sure they're getting paid. Not sure how you can simultaneously do that and allow non-validation of other stuff though.

@_date: 2014-04-10 17:17:38
Great response. The most well-reasoned criticisms I've seen. 
I think at the least, this will enable Bitcoin Beta, to allow more testing. Every miner has a vested interest in upgrading the core system so there is a large incentive to merge mine that with near 100% hashing power.  
Maybe more is possible too; I'll wait for formal documentation/papers/etc.

Sidechains could do this, yes, but:  
1) They haven't been implemented yet  
2) They will either have to be merged mined, which has its own vulnerabilities, or be mined separately, with questionable network security  
3) The could encourage the further centralization of mining, since only the biggest mining groups will take the time to set up these merged mining systems.

The Xapo ToS almost the exact same language as Circle for those parts in question.  
including  


type language.  
That entire section is about *Xapo's liability*. If the insurance company fails to pay out, it's not Xapo's fault. That's the whole point of hiring an insurance company. Xapo is doing certain procedures where the *insurance company* promises to pay out, *even if Xapo ends up being at fault*.
The "our fault" language/reasoning is completely orthogonal to this question, but it's also easy to explain. They're obviously not going to pay you if you get phished.  
They are plainly claiming 100% coverage of coins. If they are lying, that's fraud.

You're kind of arguing both directions at the same time.  
You're saying transactions won't be included because of latency, but long-term miners get absolutely nothing for mining a blank block. The size of the block and/or required fees will be determined by the marginal latency incurred by each additional transaction.  
You can't tell me you've already done the math in the future on what those marginal latencies will be unless you show me the math, re-configured for a ~0 block reward.  
I'm not arguing about today. We all know what is happening today, and it's primarily because the block reward is gigantic compared to typical fees. At worst long-term you're arguing the *required fees* of transactions will be inordinately high compared to its utility(and thusly people won't want to pay them, leading to too low security). Definitely an argument to be made there.  
Interestingly sidechains could side-step a lot of this. There's no cost to orphaning a sidechain block outside its transaction fees, so we'll be able to quickly find out what those marginal costs are today, and exploit that utility.

If you ramped up production the marginal costs should go to ~$40 is my guess(it's just an ARM chip and a tiny screen essentially, with software 100% open source). Still, let's pretend this is the only price ever:  
Smartphones are not *that* secure. Aside from the relatively closed-source nature of even Android and apps, the baseband is closed source and apparently pretty easy to hack. If people start storing a lot of money on their phones hackers will start developing easy-to-use tools to grab coin. The Trezor a purpose-built device with very few attack vectors, compared to a general-purpose computing device(which mobile phones are).  
It's also a lot smaller, and lighter.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:54:30
Ah. I could definitely see this similar to how there is a subsidy for people mining on p2pool. 
In the future honestly I still don't think it'll be a problem. Anyone who runs a Bitcoin business will be running their own node, and making friends with the others, making sure all their nodes are hooked up together and talking.  
Mining consolidation is still a bummer tho :/

Interestingly Bitcoin is the most secure when lots of people are mining "at a loss", meaning they are not making enough btc to pay for the electricity to run it.  
If in the future everyone is heating their water and space-heating with ASICs, and people also do negative EV games like lottery when mining, that would result in a very secure network.  
Mining secret chains would become very very expensive.

What a strange article.  
While I don't think they're putting miners on a phone, the market could make some sense overall. People can mine as little or as much as they like, using devices they already have acquired. 


They’re not putting a miner on our phone. Moving on.  
You do realize that 22 cents a month, times let's say all the people in the US, amounts to ~$70M in mining per month, right? That's a *HUGE* security budget(25*144*30*$230 = only $24.8M), and if people don't care about 22 cents worth of mining, why not?  
One big * is the question of how those devices will construct blocks for mining. I'd hope some sort of easy "pick a pool" or "point to a full node you trust"(including your own) would be possible. Otherwise we'd have lots of miners working blind, which while possibly better than mining ecosystem today, it isn't that much better.

My optimistic scenario is:

3) Large custodial institutions do MSB stuff.

"Mainstream" is undefined. I like more understandable goals.  
For example, 2014 was "year of multisig", and by and large it's been realized. Multisig wallets have taken off in quality, popularity, and use. The number of p2sh transactions has risen to about 1k a day. In addition, a number of hardware wallets have been released, including Trezor and BTChip. *All* of my BTC reside in multisig or hardware wallets.  
For 2015, what are we looking forward to?

Proof-of-NobodyGivesAShit. Papering over a gushing wound. Not my job to prove their million-tweak scheme is fatal in any particular way. The "don't accept forks X blocks deep" should allow any sane person to stop caring. That goes for Ethereum too(Vitalik is dreaming up "novel" PoS schemes).    


Aside from Stellar consensus failure(which they are backing off to a single validator until it's fixed),

You still need to connect to 1 person with a valid chain. Chains are deterministic-ally valid. You may have the "real" chain hidden from you still, which is longer/whatever.

While you are correct, I think the more interesting thing is that a lot of the infrastructure being created to keep bitcoins safe are directly applicable to securing keys(and identities) in general.  
Trezors, multisig(thanks to multisig in bitcoin, they're thinking about PGP solutions as well), etc.  
Also with the blockchain we can embed messages to deprecate keys, or something. Still thinking this through, but I'm certainly not the only one thinking of it. IIRC a PGP key server is actively using the blockchain to timestamp their pages.
@_date: 2014-08-03 13:48:03

There is no particular paralysis. Many people just don't like your solution, Gavin, for one reason or another.  
I for one will not agree to a bump unless all the pro-forces put it in writing that they will not advocate another "kick the can down the road" increase. But we fundamentally disagree on how dangerous full blocks are long-term, I suspect, making any agreement dispensable.

Doesn't really matter what ideas they are thinking of now.  
None of these address the issue of private pools, which is where the money will be made. Even not considering those pools, people aren't going to solomine, and joining bigger pools is almost always better.  
Treechains is the only idea out there that has somewhat of a chance of fixing it. And even then, even if it was magically implemented, I'm not sure it would convince people to stop joining megapools.

On the former that doesn't appear to be true. You can use a different commitment structure that is unconditionally sound. When broken it breaks privacy only.

That is a partially explanatory factor, but you do realize someone could CPU mine without a full node, right? A vast majority of miners today hand over their votes to a centralized pool, and have no control on what they're mining on.  
It's a larger trend of people handing over their vote: Moving to SPV wallets, hosted wallets, centralized pools, cloud hashing.

Right, but imagine we are two large mining pools. It's better for us to just pretend, and propagate our blocks faster to each other, then let the "gentlemen agreement" saps propagate theirs slower as we send them our inflated blocks.  
I think "proof of publication" is necessary. And that's accomplished in Bitcoin by storing the full block, unfortunately.

I think people like you have massively fetishized decentralized services, beyond their actual use.  
Decentralization is a means, *not and end*. In the end it's about *users* and how it affects them. If a slight amount of centralization on the edges increases the usability of a decentralized ledger, it's not clear why that's a loss.

Same people who run them even though they use SPV clients for everything... like me.  
You can also run partially-pruned nodes, which keep around however much you allow. So everyone can contribute whatever they can given their disk constraints.  
That will likely balloon the number of total copies of blockchain, not shrink it.  
Even further, pruned nodes will be keeping a fairly large recent history(to recover from large re-orgs), so all fairly caught up nodes will be able to grab new-ish blocks from absolutely anyone. Only people starting from ~0 will be hitting archival nodes relatively hard.
FWIW I won't be running a pruned node. I have plenty of bandwidth and space.

The probability that you create the same key pair is vanishingly small due to the large numbers.  
Go print out what 2^160(~10^48) looks like. Then divide it by 7 billion. That's how many keys everyone gets. It'd be a waste of computing power trying to get someone's money that way.

All it means is "get your work done".  
Of course if people are stupid they'll correlate "sitting at desk" to productivity, so it has to be done well.

I really wonder what the upper-limits to using the Bitcoin blockchain as an anchor for contracts is.  
Lightning Networks appear to be getting close. Two transactions for possibly an infinite amount of transactions over as long a time as the parties want.  
I wonder if a colored-coin sidechain could do the same? Frictionless HFT of stocks, etc, that only hit the main chain when done trading.

Old idea:   
Allows very cheap/fast transactions, with negatives being you must "pre-fund" the account, and loss of some privacy to the hub.  
The end result is that you could prefund an address with $10, and spend it on different media as you see fit, in as small increments as you'd like, instantly, for free. After the time runs out, you can get the rest of your money back.

Stay away from mining:  
Those who have the productive capacity are finding "get rich quick" people as buyers, not knowing they can't break even.  
Those who have the miners and realize they can't break even are trying to re-sell them at denial prices.  
My guess is the ASIC scene will be a lot more stable in 5 years. Cheap plug-in ASICs, where the majority of cost will be electricity/running a full node.

I respect your opinion, but you're shifting intrinsic costs of running a server onto *every single supporter/user of the system*, even if they're being careful in using resources. You can't seriously argue this scales better.  
It's the mis-alignment in incentives since people only pay once to put crap on the chain, everyone else gets to indirectly pay forever.

I'm seeing lots of argumentation on why we should structure the security and long-term stability of the system based on 0-conf. Apparently this now covers mempool management. Hearn says that full blocks means mempools will get too big. The obvious way to fix this is to prioritize your mempool based on some policy, dropping transactions as you get full. The obvious way would be by txnfee. But this would make 0-conf "unsafe" so Hearn is against it.  (to be fair creating a good policy is probably hard, and not sure if mine is correct, although it's essentially a RBF-when-full, but my assumption is he wouldn't like it for that particular reason)
I guess it's an internally consistent argument but people(like me) who think full blocks aren't doom aren't persuaded. We are being asked to design Bitcoin to uphold something we don't think it's good for over more stable solutions.

There's no particular standard yet, I think there's a BIP in the works though. The hope is someday people can just select a wallet, and the wallet gives the users choice on m-of-n key arrangements, with different signing services. 
As far as GA.it is concerned, they have an API for their server that will sign the transactions when asked and/or you respond to a 2FA challenge. These days people use the main GreenAddress wallet, but there's no reason you have to.

I think we already had this argument before.  
How about this: I give you the algorithm, you implement and prove to others it's not workable? I could write up some pseudo-code for you.  
Not sure someone has to prove that ANOTHER persons' crypto stuff isn't trivially broken. That's backwards. It's on bc.info to show it's strength/weakness.  
It's like the altcoiners that go banging around their random broken systems and egging people on "oh yeah? WELL BREAK IT!!!". No.

You could envision a scenario where it takes days to crack any specific key with a QC, which means the original spender could safely migrate coins to a new QC-resistant address. With CT the underlying pubkeys are exposed at all times so as soon as an address is revealed the clock starts.

Well, anyone who wants full privacy and security of the system has to run one, or trust someone else to run one for them.  


No. What you're thinking of is an embedded security model. Blocks are only valid if all transactions in the block are validated. (necessary but not sufficient)  
SPV users can't vote in any meaningful way in the system, can't check if Bitcoin is being inflated, or if transactions are valid.  
So the question is: "How hard should it be to fully participate in the system?" It's a political question, so don't get surprised when people disagree!
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:16:31
I'm more amenable to first lower the block time slowly to ~2min. 5x transactions, penalizes small pools less by decreasing variance.

@_date: 2015-05-08 16:00:32
Uh, I just told you.  
Right now, people have to send transactions that have either enough coin age or fees to get included(by and large). These get cleared out fast enough simply because volume is low. Higher volume on a fixed block size means there would be more unconfirmed transactions hanging around.  
Gavin wants to fix this by increasing blocksize.  
I say fix it using common sense and just dropping based on some priority. (long-term I think txn fee ranking is best)  
Sorry if I'm not being clear.

I'm against a blocksize increase for now, but this is a salient point. The point is *we don't know* how to optimize it, and we have a hunch making it easier/keeping is easy to run a full node is one knob we can optimize over. Personally I think it's mostly education. I think everyone should try running a full node once, and understand the security benefits(both personally and systematically), even if they don't end up using one.  
Long way of saying: We need better metrics, and we need Layer 2 services to be developed for any hoping of scaling a decentralized system.

A 20 year old creating a turing complete language to build distributed consensus systems? Oh boy. Interesting, but I think they are going to find out it's not easy. I'm going to venture that this project is something like 15 years too early. We don't know enough about distributed consensus.

He said skeptic. They are indeed all pretty skeptical sans Gavin. Hearn doesn't really do Core stuff; he does Bitcoinj.(which is useful and great, but means he gets less weight imo)

@_date: 2015-05-19 14:56:50
You're right to be confused. Perhaps their original plan was just mining in farms, then they realized it's not that profitable. 
Next they realized putting some sort of chip that can do secure signing and a bit of mining might work. People could mine at work(heh) stealing nominal amounts of energy, and long-term mining is re-introduced to the masses. That isn't particularly profitable. Instead 21 builds on the edges, and uses these chips as authentication for hub-spoke payments and the like?  
Or maybe they're freaking retarded.  
I'm not convinced(and mining chips as authentication makes no freaking sense), but I'm also not writing them off.

Maxwell surely understands the argument. He's saying it's not proven at all. Which it isn't. There are a number of scenarios where being "honest" doesn't seem to be rational in the short term, but miners still go along with it. It's hard to say why other than "altruism", or "they use default bitcoind settings" or something.  
Never confuse "it's still running fine" with "the system is secure".

Do you have evidence for this? Many, many things have happened since its inception, accidental bugs/forks included, and we got through it. MtGox even(malleability STILL isn't fixed)?

In defense of bit: If we decide on using 10^-6 under any name, the whole point is to *not* use mBTC. Bits would just be the way people talk about the currency. You would say 1,000 bits.

The numbers Gregory is focusing on are decentralization parameters. So things like, number of reachable full nodes, mining centralization, are businesses actually running their own full nodes(apparently a lot don't and are being encouraged not to by blockchain indexing services!?!).  
Seems to be what he's most worried about.  
Now, putting hard numbers on what he wants to see could be easily faked, right? That's the sticky issue. One miner pretends to be 1,000 different ones, a million sybil nodes pop up, etc. It's going to be inherently an art measuring this.

AFAICT he's referring the the risk of many nlocktime'd contracts timing out. The risk is higher under 1MB regime than 100MB, sure, but that logic goes to infinity(any sized full block is a risk for it), hence their dynamic blocksize stuff in the paper.

Which is why SHA256 hashrate will concentrate on it.  
It's the first, and has massive network effect working for it.
The biggest 51% risk is definitely the consolidation of mining chip creation. But again, this is a different danger imo since shutting down a few plants as a govt is a lot simpler than somehow convincing rational miners to openly create a 51% pool.

timestamps are only used for difficulty retargets(sort of... nodes will also fail to propagate new blocks that have timestamps too far off). They aren't that important because you can't trust anyone to report the correct time.

Or you know, you could resubmit transactions with higher fees.  
And nodes can clear out their mempool at any time using any drop method they like.  
Probably a mixture of limited RBF and coin age.

The website can be changed at any time. Unless you check the source, it could get swapped out with a page that just steals your password as you type it in, and steals your btc. bc.info gets hacked, you're screwed.  
1-of-1 means that if your password gets intercepted somehow, you can get cleaned out completely.  
Lastly, using passwords for security is a weak idea in general due to bad entropy.  
In contrast:  
1) Use a desktop/browser extension based app that doesn't auto-update  
2) Use a multisig wallet with 2FA (I use GreenAddress on Android, but there are more out there)  
A non-auto updating Android version of blockchain app is *better* than the browser version, at least.

That's a great point.  
If you type in an incorrect password for BIP38 it throws an error right? I think BIP39 gives more protection than you let on since you have to actually derive wallet branches, etc, and check balances, rather than wait for a correct private key to result and then grab the balances for it from the UTXO.  
The attacker won't know if they should continue to attack the wallet unless they have extra info like your actual balance.
Anyone done the math for that?

No, that kind of floating fee wouldn't work, unless it's 100% automated somehow. Miners have the incentive to chase lower and lower fees(and users of the system to send them cheaper) until we reach marginal ~0 fees per transaction.

There is no reason that bitcoin has to do any particular level. But I think it's silly to keep the 1MB block size forever considering the hardware and infrastructure improvements in the last 6 years. 
In my opinion we might want to hit the cap for a bit just to see what happens and revisit later. Going back down in size could also be done via softfork so a single large jump could be beneficial in a few years. 
Either way it's going to be an ugly fight as raising it locks some out of full nodes and keeping it low also locks the poor out from using it via fees.

Enough for what? It really depends on the application and the security it demands.  
Exchanges demand 6+ so they aren't defrauded, for example.  
A simple client shouldn't ask for too many confirmations, since you're only putting yourself at risk of orphan blocks.

The longer I'm in the space, the less I believe this will be true. The block chain is not designed to carry the weight of many of the designs.  
There are some things that make sense:  
Digital stocks(you can prove that you only issued X amount in a distributed fashion.  
Time-stamping service / notary  
Other stuff like Mastercoin don't really make much sense, as you really don't need to put it there for exchanges and the like. Everyone has to store exchange activity, forever? Seems like a bad idea.  
OTOH, making Bitcoin the currency useful and safe is a big challenge worth tackling, and will already change the face of the internet if done.

Yeah I'm not sure about the exactly practical implications.  
Bitcoin-like systems can already do atomic swaps, so it'd have to be a situation where as long as the person puts up a relatively large collateral in BTC, you can trust them with the BTC/fiat you send them until the next round of payment.

Indeed. Bittorrent has lived a LONG time quite successfully purely based on altruism.  
In fact, most clients have pretty stupid altruistic sharing behavior, just because there aren't many malicious users out there!

No, it's the max number of inputs allowed for a single transaction, not block size. CounterParty probably doesn't do all this stuff in one transaction, which means you can have an unbounded number of contributions. Lighthouse uses a single Bitcoin transaction, so fees are actually quite small.  
The design for now is set such that people don't make HUGE projects like you talked about. Instead make smaller bite-sized chunks.  


No, not with the current Bitcoin protocol. You could always set up another project.  


No. You can do it on the side if you desire, but that's not being done to  avoid legal/ethical issues.  


Again, you can chunk up the project into a number of smaller dependent projects. The address being sent to can be a multisig address controlled by whoever they'd like.

At the extreme end miners would be spending most their $$$ on things like bandwidth, etc, and not on hashing, so yes.  
However there could be a huge amount of headroom where the tradeoff is quite gentle. For example 1MB -&gt; 2MB would probably result in ~0 hashing security tradeoff.

Mining specifically simply being available for peons like you and me is just a nice side-benefit.
@_date: 2016-01-19 18:18:09
You say there are only small incentives for miners to use it. But the truth is a small reduction in stale rate means "life or death" for most mining outfits.  
The only question you have to ask is "will this reduce stale rates, keep them the same or increase them?".   
The other way to look at it is: "Why wouldn't a miner run it?". Seems to me it'd only be in the case of really low bandwidth caps(???) or if they are doing block withholding/selfish/stubborn mining. Which will continue to be a problem regardless.

Exactly. Seems a kind of backwards way of fixing this, rather than just saying "dump transactions as needed". (I'd just order based on fee or coin-age, or something scarce, as long as it's a total ordering)  
Of course this makes the system far more robust while making 0-conf less safe, meaning Mike would never go for it.

Don't get this part:  


will be rewarded for securing ChainDB’s blocks via transaction fees associated with bids. It is
possible that as a ChainDB becomes increasingly popular, Bitcoin miners may directly participate
in a chain and create their own ChainDB block defining transactions. Miners could collect the
ChainDB rewards directly for themselves. However, with nearly all of the value associated with a
ChainDB block manifesting itself as a Bitcoin transaction fee, there is little reason for a miner to
do so.

That's my optimistic take on the current system. It also means we're stuck with begging pools to not get to 51%, and begging them to allow us to change the protocol when necessary.   
Treechains, if it somehow magically works, makes mining much more decentralized, allows natural scalability, and pushes validation onto clients, freeing up people from having to convince miners of necessary changes. Of course it's not actually developed yet, so it's not a real choice today.

For a 259 byte transaction(current median size) it takes roughly 5 cents in fees to get in next block.  
@_date: 2016-03-09 14:29:02
I'd hope it would be roughly around what your mempool considers the min mempool fee. If you're not going to store+forward it, why ask for it?  
For example, my full node is at:
  "size": 14865,  
  "bytes": 138801385,  
  "usage": 299989344,  
  "maxmempool": 300000000,  
  "mempoolminfee": 0.00002013  
So anything below 0.00002013 feerate(BTC/kB?) should simply not be relayed to me, which is quite cheap.

Nodes will simply drop low fee transactions from their memory pool.

"Bitcoin Core lacks unit tests for large chunks of its code, partly because it also lacks infrastructure for writing them. This project involves writing unit tests that cover the networking stack and allowing the construction of individual test block chains, so behaviour of parts of the code that uses block chains can be easily tested.
Unit tests are a key technique used to ensure software quality. They are small programs that check the correct functioning of a single aspect of a larger program. Unit tests help make changes less risky and software less buggy, by verifying that new versions still conform to the previous tests.
The project deliverable is a set of patches on top of Bitcoin Core, that will at minimum be applied to Bitcoin XT and will also be submitted upstream. The minimum functionality is a framework for writing network message tests, changes to make the block chain management code resettable (so it can be tested over and over), and as many unit tests exploiting the new functionality as can be fitted into the time available. Estimated duration is four weeks."

It's a really naive solution. May be best we have, but it's really not interesting at all. OTOH we have Lightning Networks for example, which is more engineering work, but also scales infinitely better with no centralization risks.

Nevermind, I think he meant that spending *from* a segwit address is required to segwit transaction. Which is true.  
Sending *to* a segwit address does nothing to affect the malleability of a transaction.  
FWIW I helped edit the BIPs some :P
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:59:50
He means that the miners could be inflating the money supply and tricking SPV clients. Or anything else. If there is a blocksize hardfork unilaterally your node will catch this and reject it. 
 You as a fully validating nodes gets to decide what is valid. Miners can only twist your arm in quite extreme circumstances.

This is the catch-22 of Bitcoin development. If it's done in the open, like it should be, it's immediately copied by everyone. People will buy the Trezor due to name reputation, track record, and possibly as a donation for all your hard work. Hopefully that's enough to get you guys close to the black.  
I'm now wondering what the marginal cost of a smart card version of Trezor would cost.

Heh, I was about to just make fun of the idea, but interesting.
Additional cons:
1) Satellites eventually crash and burn. You'd have to have a system in place to allow that and have somewhat dynamic membership. This means over time the replacement ritual could be compromised  
2) Due to space hazards you'd have to build them like a tank, plus radiation shielding, etc.  
TL;DR Too freaking expensive, but fun to think about.

All(?) the Bitcoin Core devs including people like Peter Todd think reimplementations should only be used in conjunction with a full Core node as a sanity checker.

1) SegWit isn't released/activated yet, so hold your horses
2) BIP142 addresses have been put on hold for now. Instead we will be using embedded p2sh addresses, which will look just like normal addresses. This is orthogonal to how they will send it. Your address will allow *you* to send a segwit transaction later spending those funds.

@_date: 2015-05-30 10:55:13
Indeed. Unless we figure out how to scale it.  
The cool thing about Lightning Network style payments is that even though the Bitcoin Network is full of transactions, it's only the opening and closing one that really counts. Something will have to be done to make sure the closing one can post even in the presence of some sort of DoS attack.(There are a number of cool ideas for that)
@_date: 2014-02-08 15:12:25
I like the idea of 2-of-3 keys for one's money:  
One key on phone/Trezor/secure device, one key in a lockbox somewhere, and one key at your "bank". The bank can't ever steal your money, but when you want to spend, you shoot them the details, and they sign off on the transaction, then you can sign, and the money sends.  
If your trezor explodes and somehow you can't regenerate it, get the other key from the lockbox and get your money back.

Using monkey-math following the poisson distribution, it's the CDF, where lambda is 1(you expect one block), and k is 8(you found 8 instead).

@_date: 2015-01-26 14:12:32
0-confirmation means the transactions haven't been ordered. They can send you one version of the transaction, then the mining pools a different one with a higher fee.

Ok, so the ASICs are far more than just miners.

Instead it makes all devices capable of secure signing and making (off-chain?) transactions with all other types of machines.
@_date: 2015-05-08 12:53:42
Right, but we shouldn't assume you are the norm when designing a protocol. To be fair long term I *hope* mining is done by people like you(it makes the network really secure!), I just don't want to assume it.

Given the current adoption rate, they are more than enough. Every single bitcoin user today could buy as many coffees as they like all day every day(actually a lot more people than now. 56 million people could do this if setting up channels once a year). Assuming worldwide adoption, it might work with ~130MB. Obviously the network today couldn't handle that.   
And it ignores machine to machine payments. Lots of unknowns.
Some envelope numbers and scenarios here: 
@_date: 2015-05-08 15:51:16
Right now most transactions get included in a block quickly, so there isn't a huge pool of unconfirmed yet valid transactions.  
If blocks are consistently full, the number of valid unconfirmed transactions will go up.  
(Of course there are more direct strategies to be done to not get DoS'd then increase block size)
@_date: 2015-05-19 13:26:52

2MB HF + SW SF = 8MB blocks. Too big for consensus.  
The 4x discounting is to incentivize people to slow the growth of the UTXO set.

~~ehh, that's not right. The sender defines whether or not the particular transaction is unintentionally malleable. The receiver defines how the output can be spent later.~~
He probably meant the other way, which is correct. Spending "from" segwit addresses makes a segwit transaction.

Remember that a wallet address is you defining the terms of the funds moving again. So if you give a p2pkh address to an upgraded wallet, you will see "anyone can spend" funds magically move to your wallet. From there your client will completely understand the transaction you will make.

Tracking limits closer to validation cost is good. Letting miners decide it is not a good idea.

Depends on what "succeed" means. Linux is widely used even though it's certainly not easier to use for the typical consumer.  
Even if it never becomes nice and transparent to the user(it might, can't say), it could still change the face of the internet.  
The USD is great for the use case scenarios many have. It's the unknown use cases that are most exciting, tbh.  
If someone is expecting us to just stop using the USD(modulo some crazy petrodollar collapse), they are historically short-sighted.

I'm arguing against his point, which is papering over very important differences. Running a lightning network hub means the network operator is taking on the costs. Increasing the blocksize externalizes this cost to everyone else, regardless of usage of his system.

"Miners are here to order transaction data, publish, and get paid. They get paid quite handsomely. It's really not their job to change the ruleset. That's on users."

I can't speak for anyone else, but most Bitcoin companies are seemingly intentionally not hiring Bitcoin experts. They are hiring coders. I am a researcher by trade, and would consider myself knowledgeable about Bitcoin. I was rejected out of hand for a number of companies based on the "code over the phone" interviews with things like order-book algorithms, and was not asked anything about Bitcoin itself.  (not saying I'm an obvious hire, I just find it strange they don't care about understanding of the core tech being built on)  
Not a slight per se, but then the results are quite obvious. Major companies have turned away or drove away anyone who understands the tech, and we're left with this situation. (Boy have I heard *stories*)  
There are exceptions, and I'm hoping in the future these VC companies understand that long-term everyone needs to pitch in.

It required 95% of mining hashing power to activate, not full nodes. There is no way to legitimately detect who is running what version. The good news is soft-forks allow users to not upgrade immediately if they don't want to use the new features.

I agree that SQL database bitcoin are arguably not bitcoin currency. But that line gets quite blurry. Are LN transactions not transacting in bitcoin? Smart-contract enforced scaling solutions aren't promissory notes, surely. What about a merge-mined sidechain? Open Transactions federation? Fedpeg with hardened federation?  
There is clearly a spectrum of scaling solutions on a trustless/efficiency curve. Pushing what people use to the "top right" of such a graph is needed.

Here's a list of neat ideas:   
My personal dark-horse favorite is MAST. Will make smart contracts cheap to settle non-adversarial, like when LN channel holders close cooperatively. Convention may be to have "Left sub-branch is normal execution, right is breach-of-contract". Would give tons of privacy and savings. 2-of-2 multisig wallets like GreenAddress too. Left branch appears as normal 2-of-2, right branch is the "breach" where the service stops responding and uses relative locktime.

Nothing wrong with hiring lots of coding wizards. I'm pretty average. I wasn't hurt at all!   
The problem is many of these companies have zero(0!) people that hang out on IRC, regularly chat with Core devs, or contribute code to the project. It's a huge disconnect. And it leads to embarrassing op-eds as we've seen lately of CEOs saying patently false things.

I think this can be safely done on a ~year timescale. You only need an economic majority. Therefore if all major economic end points agree to it, and users don't see this as an attack that requires a HF in response, then it will succeed.
But consensus-gathering would be the first step, not locking in decisions before.

No. Masternodes are simply "super" nodes that are given special "powers" in the network.  
LN is a way of, in a completely decentralized way, setting up trust-minimized off-chain payments that are settled on-chain. LN is based off of the scripting language of Bitcoin, not extra consensus rules.

Remember the sigops limit still exists(I think it's doubled in current code?), and is un-quadraticized re:hashing. The extra data doesn't enter in UTXO at all. Significantly better than a naked 2MB HF bump.
@_date: 2017-03-13 13:34:11
By design BU makes sure to be as compatible as possible with wallets/lite clients, even though it's a HF. This makes it impossible, since Segwit is a softfork (can only make things less-valid).
In a responsible HF, the HFing party would be required to take anti-replay measures. But this is a sybil attack, not a responsible HF.

In addition, during non-malicious soft-forks you will still know how much money you have, and will be able to safely spend it. The biggest risk is receiving transactions(or chains of transactions) you don't understand with 0/1-conf.

That's what a txid is, but the problem is that the signature is being hashed. This means your counter-party in the 2-of-2 signature transactions can change the txid out from under you! This means chaining transactions(which use txid as ref) get broken.  
Segwit fixes this by putting the signature outside.

It has never been called a vote because it never was a vote. BIP9 is signaling readiness. It's useful in that we can use miners' signaling as an activation condition, and as long as miners aren't lying(or have incorrectly implemented a softfork ala bip66) a chain split will not occur.
I'm very anti-chainsplit, but BIP9 has seemingly continued this confusion into 2017. I think discussing how best to move on without miners needing to be kingmaker is a good thing. Miners are here to order transaction data, publish, and get paid. They get paid quite handsomely. It's really not their job to change the ruleset. That's on users.
This confusion has long-extended into Hardfork discussions as well. Hardforks are user-driven by definition, yet Gavin and others have tried to make it out like it's miner driven. It's not! Users are free to HF at any time, including to resist malicious Softforks.
If users deem a UASF as an attack, they must treat it as a 51% attack by miners, and HF. That has always been the case, and will continue to be.
(this is not support of any particular UASF proposal. I think status quo is superior to chainsplit, and will be challenging the proponents to make a safe as possible approach)

@_date: 2017-03-28 12:59:11
minor committer here.
There are two dimensions really to this problem:
1) In general, blocksize increases require a HF, which can easily result in a chain split if there's not consensus. These are also centralizing events. If someone tries to strong-arm and succeeds, they'll likely try again later.
2) The amount of data required to propagate along the miner network has a direct centralizing effect. There are now private relay networks which are quite fast even at larger amounts, but these are no replacement for the p2p network, as they are more easy to censor.
So with 1 and 2 together, we have this issue that we can only increase the blocksize when we have the technical means to handle it, and every time you do it, it has a centralizing effect(towards developers). I don't think anyone has a good answer for this yet.
That said, Segwit is already a blocksize increase to likely something north of 2MB. And maybe someday when the community is more united in purpose a longer-term growth HF can be revisited. I'd prefer something like  which is slow and steady growth, giving the community time to plan ahead.

Exactly. One side thinks full blocks will break Bitcoin. The other thinks lack of participation in mining/running full nodes will.
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:31:09
If your deprecated full node sees transaction version numbers higher than it has, and sees transactions it doesn't understand, it should just wait a couple confirmations to be sure.  
If you're really worried worst case just shut your node down if you see an upgraded version number. That is just as safe or safer than running a deprecated version during a HF.

I think the most important chart is "Propagation time by block", which shows ranges of 0.5 to 5 seconds for propagation of blocks across all their nodes, but it's hard to say as these charts aren't really explained.

There's consistent churn from what I can tell. 
The P2P/validation side of things I think has gotten thinner. Not really any payoff and refactoring is hell to review and rebase. 
You mention Peter Todd but really the times he was more active it was clearly a smaller development community. Probably smaller(at least in power devs) compared to peak performance boosting era to improve block relay.

To be more explicit, non-segwit miners will not be asked by Segwit nodes on the p2p network for blocks, so non-segwit mined blocks will basically get partitioned without "bridge" nodes.
In mainnet:
1) There are multiple private relay networks which side-step this effect altogether
2) Miners should be upgrading to segwit if activated anyways.

Why you should run a full node:  
Mining is the act of ordering transactions into a history to prevent double-spending. This is done by Proof of Work.
Running a full node, and using it for financial transactions, ensures that miners have limited power.

It depends on mempool syncronization among peers, and if any "prefilling"(predictively sending) is done.
During the mempool flooding, it looks like I degraded from about 75% of blocks being received in 0.5 RTT, so 40%. We can probably ameliorate some of that by looking not only in our block mempool, but rejected mempool, conflict, etc. On average the "misses" were still quite small. A bit of predictive sending could probably get us much higher, but that's not for Core 0.13.   
Looks like I'm back up to 60% since the mempool flooding settled down: 
@_date: 2016-06-01 12:04:29
~~Because it wasn't open source at the time, I believe.~~

A successful softfork ensures network convergence over time. Hardforks don't, as two forks could last indefinitely.  
Stale blocks happen because of miners disagreeing which blocks came first, not different rulesets. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:53:55
So one issue might be is that your node wasn't warmed up with recent transaction data. It's doing estimation from mempool-&gt;block inclusion, AFAIK. 
My local node is guessing a fee about 7x larger than yours attached for 2 block confirmation. For 24 blocks, it's guessing about 3x. If anything Core is vastly prone to overestimating the required fee. (21.co fee estimator is showing something much lower required) 
For `sendtoaddress` if you simply want to send a whole balance, use `subtractfeefromamount` option, the 5th argument. This means there is no guess and check.

CSV stands for "checksequenceverify". It refers to a specific field in the transaction itself which is being used as a relative timelock.
What it does is lets you set an output to be unspendable for X blocks once the preceding transaction is included in the blockchain. It allows for a "timeout" of the funds, which will often be combined with other logic to allow smart contract fail-safes.

Here ya go, my local node:   
The hug spikes in requested transactions(like the beginning) are from me starting the node cold(laptop has been not so stable, or I travel). It seems to get better the longer you run it as its mempool becomes consistent with peers.

There is a future spec yet to be written that allows you to update it to a new max amount, yes, but that requires replacing the current channel, so that will cost 1 on-chain tx.

Depends on the setup:
1) Trezor: requires a pin to be clicked on the computer(with numbers only shown on device screen). Or someone gets access to your mnemonic backup word list. It's also not as resistant to physical attack since it's on a general microcontroller.
2) Ledger: Requires pin to be entered, if wrong pin entered 3 times the device is wiped. Or attacker gets access to your backup word list. It's more resistant to physical attack due to the smartcard architecture.
With both of these I'm guessing backup world list security is the weakest link. Make sure it's stored somewhere safe, or an additional passphrase is used on top(both support this in some capacity).

Signaling for changes isn't to be done at p2p layer(as a "vote"). Completely sybilable.

You'd also need people to downgrade their nodes since over 90% of nodes enforce segwit

@_date: 2016-11-23 15:27:36
Because p2sh is a direct analogy. Legacy nodes do not evaluate the signatures of p2sh transactions. Identical to Segwit, the only difference being the data itself is outside the legacy transaction. This has some additional risks, but completely unrelated to "lying" to old nodes.

At this point I kindly ask: point to the code where it would be simpler as a hardfork.
@_date: 2016-12-12 04:55:25
Using the softforking method for changes to Bitcoin means as long as a majority of hashpower is enforcing the new ruleset, no ETC-like forking is possible.  
Softforks are a *restriction* in rulesets, which means blocks that are previously valid are no longer valid. Older nodes will therefore follow the majority hashpower since Segwit blocks are *just as valid* before and after the softfork.

Miniscript automatically generated a script that is 20 bytes smaller and trivial to reason about spend size.

Lots of people like the idea of a flexcap, including me, but the issue is of misaligned incentives. Miners and users are not the same thing anymore, sadly. I'm probably more inclined to do the Rusty-idea of "just grow each block by a few bytes" or something, for a few years. Nice small growth, and re-assess at the end.
But we have lots of other priorities too, such as mitigating utxo set growth, making mining more fair, cramming more into smaller spaces with aggregation, and more.

One issue with this is that the signaling mechanism is supposed to only mean "I am ready to mine segwit", not "I support segwit". It's to protect legacy nodes from getting too many confirmations that will get orphaned, or from a failed softfork that gets reverted.

Fees at the absolute margins will pay for non-hashing infrastructure only like the marginal bandwidth and storage cost for that miner only, which is ~0. Unless there is a cartel with minimum fees, or capped resource cost, this is the case. We want fees/subsidy to pay for hashing, otherwise there is ~0 security.
But this has been theoretically modeled for years now, and I've probably stated this fact(with the paper citation I've lost) on reddit 500 times, and it doesn't matter, because every new failure know-nothing idiot project can simply ignore the literature and Dream Big.

1) Install app  
2) Settings  
3) Tap the "connect only blah blah" setting, and put in .onion address. If you put in non-onion address the app warns you strongly to do so in the popup. We may even make the notification even stronger, as obviously people should be using this one.
4) Restart by backing out, or setting-&gt;exit, or manually killing. 
5) Start App. A toast will come up telling you it's trying to connect and when it is able to. Toasts come up every time to give user assurance that it's connecting to what you entered earlier. Also Tor connection takes a few seconds depending on phone muscle.

I think this conversation reveals who is a ex-Google developer and who has worked on security software. One wants to develop fast and break things, the other doesn't. In any other software ecosystem Mike may be right.
Unfortunately a lot of this conversation is being very indirectly used to bolster something that a supermajority of core developers don't want.  
When Mike doesn't get his way, whether it be getutxos or big blocks, he immediately assumes that's because the process is broken when in reality that is the process *working*.

You aren't monitoring a "person", you are monitoring for certain things to appear in the blockchain. I don't recall exactly the method, but it's something similar to looking for specific txids. No knowledge required a priori about the transaction itself.
For the attack you later mention basically it's symmetrical:
1) You lock up capital, opportunity cost
2) You pay half(?) the fees used in the back-out transaction

There was a single year where aside from some bursts, no one seemed to pay any fees(mid-2009 to mid-2010). Otherwise we're paying lower fees now.

Its biggest weakness is privacy, and only a couple of coins have plausible real privacy when used properly, at a great scalability(global state growing forever), auditibility(no way to validate supply of coins if/when bug occurs), and "governance" cost(HFs at least once a year).

Mining simulations run by Pieter Wuille shows that well-connected peers making a majority of the hashing power have an advantage over less-connected ones, earning more profits per hash. Larger blocks even further favor these well-connected peers. This gets even worse as we shift from block subsidy to fee based reward.  
Are you seriously saying no one has run simulations that show this again?
In addition:  


Large latencies make selfish-mining strategies more profitable at any pool size.

@_date: 2015-08-04 12:36:43
Sorry I'm not going to read the whole paper, but isn't this already known? We already know there is some fee that miners would require to overcome the orphan risk.  
If it's a paper for rigorous analysis of that, ok. Not going to poop on the party.  
I think the issue is that this type of "fee market" does not result in hashing security. You can't fund the security of the network using this. Am I missing something?

3) I have no idea how this is "misleading" as I exactly said what Tom said:  


This is exactly the sort of issues we need to worry about. And Tom agrees! If large block exacerbate the desire to co-locate(it does), this isn't a refutation at all! (I probably should add Tom's responses because apparently I'm not being clear.)   
OP is saying he's not convinced increases(in general, AFAICT) are a centralization pressure. Obviously the list isn't some sort of slam dunk proof on 8MB being bad or anything(I don't think 8MB blocks would kill Bitcoin). But every single thread some person says something like that.
So I just rounded up a number of thoughts on the subject. At least reading through this maybe people will get some inkling on why:  


Because tons of people simply don't get it.
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:02:23

@_date: 2015-08-10 11:15:02
is probably 80% in favor of major size increases al a XT, while among the tech community, it's probably more like 60/40 against, and among the Core developer community it's more like 90/10 against.  
There are many issues, but to the two most important points are the mining centralization pressures, and the fact that in the end these increases can not satisfy the world's demand for transactions. There has been much e-ink spilled on the subject. Here's a little collection of things to think about:   
Rather than do huge jumps (1MB -&gt; 8MB -&gt; 16MB -&gt; 32MB ...) I'd much rather do smaller increases as the technology catches up.  
edit: And let's not forget the only reason people are talking about XT is because Hearn and Gavin have threatened to fork without agreement among developers because they thought they could a majority of miners, businesses that required more transactions,  and to switch. This isn't some idle wistful branch. Aside from 1 developer, the entire core developer set is against a hostile XT fork.

We all know why a larger blocksize would be nice. Not a lot to say there. I think over time we could get pretty large blocks safely as technology improves.  
OTOH, here's a copy-pasta on stuff I've compiled that gives you a glimpse why it's more complicated:  
The vast majority of research demonstrates that blocksize does matter, blocksize caps are required to secure the network, and large blocks are a centralizing pressure. Here’s a short list of what has been published so far:
1) No blocksize cap and no minimum fee leads to catastrophic breakage as miners chase marginal 0 fees: 


It’s important to note that mandatory minimum fees could simply be rebated out-of-band, which would lead to the same problems.
2) a) Large mining pools make strategies other than honest mining more profitable: 


2) b) In the presence of latency, some alternative selfish strategy exists that is more profitable at any mining pool size. The larger the latency, the greater the selfish mining benefit: 


3) Mining simulations run by Pieter Wuille shows that well-connected peers making a majority of the hashing power have an advantage over less-connected ones, earning more profits per hash. Larger blocks even further favor these well-connected peers. This gets even worse as we shift from block subsidy to fee based reward :


4) Other point(s):
If there is no blocksize cap, a miner should simply snipe the fees from the latest block and try to stale that block by mining their own replacement. You get all the fees plus any more from new transactions. Full blocks gives less reward for doing so, since you have to choose which transactions to include.

There's conflicts of interest on each side. Let me give you the other side:  
I think LN is more fair because it internalizes costs. Only players who care about the transactions themselves validate and are in charge of them. In the basic Bitcoin system, everyone pays for everyone else's transactions, in terms of cpu time, clock time, bandwidth, etc. It's also in some weird way a step towards Peter Todd's idea of "embedded consensus" aka only validate what you care about. (Obviously different but I think the parallels are interesting)  
So to me, people clamouring for larger blocks have a "conflict of interest" in the other direction because they want others to pay their costs.  
I know I won't change your mind in this post, but it's something to think about and realize that every side has interests.

I agree that people will pay just enough to get included, which I imagine in some idealistic infinite block scenario would be the amount needed to pay for orphan risk.
Are you claiming that the security would be enough, even if miners are including all transactions that give orphan risk-level fees?  
That would be an interesting conclusion.
From my naive brainstorming it seems to me that the incentive, again, is to pack in as many transactions as possible that squeak past the orphan risk. You as a miner are only willing to spend enough hashing power to pay for that marginal revenue. So again, this marginal value seems to go toward 0. No?  
Any critiques? I simply made inferences beyond the paper I tend to cite, and it seems clear to me.

The idea is that you know you aren't being punked by the GA server, as well as more privacy.  
Your trusted node will serve you the "correct" headers(you're doing full node validation, right?) and all UTXOs you want to know about(no withholding attack), all without leaking any additional privacy to random nodes on the network.

It's a metaphor, meaning "change". Meaning "make an educated local guess if this transaction is likely to get in a block anytime soon".  


If your "attack" model is "my lower fee transaction won't go through", then sure. Any other attack model is clearly easier to pull off in the larger-block model.

While it's interesting to note that mining isn't permanently 51% attacked by a slim majority of cartel-ing miners, adding additional incentives to cartel/co-locate/centralize isn't the answer to me.  
My hope is that over time the incentives will lead mining to be spread around the globe, done by large and small actors, pools under 5%, in many jurisdictions. It may take some architectural breakthrough, fusion energy, or something. Or maybe just simple time for ASICs to plateau and education. Who knows.
Incentivizing small individuals to deviate from honest play is what's even more dangerous.

You might as well say that your node should accept any chain with the most PoW because game theory dictates that you will be left behind otherwise.   
(And actually this makes sense in many ways. If the current mining model breaks down due to careless/malicious mining, people may switch to non-spv-only mode. You really need the hashing protection, but maybe can't assume they are mining honestly anymore.)

It's a spectrum of "collusion". For example, right now all miners are colluding to limit blocks to 1MB.  
What we want is miners to collude towards things that retain properties of the system we like, and not the other things. So yeah, everyone agrees it's not great that ~57% of hashing is in one jurisdiction, for example. Collusion on non-consensus stuff gets a lot more likely.

This fork is a one being pushed by a single Core developer and the guy who wrote(helped wrote?) Bitcoinj, the light client software.

Hey I have a copypasta for this now:  
The vast majority of research demonstrates that blocksize does matter, blocksize caps are required to secure the network, and large blocks are a centralizing pressure. Here’s a short list of what has been published so far:
1) No blocksize cap and no minimum fee leads to catastrophic breakage as miners chase marginal 0 fees: 


It’s important to note that mandatory minimum fees could simply be rebated out-of-band, which would lead to the same problems.
2) a) Large mining pools make strategies other than honest mining more profitable: 


2) b) In the presence of latency, some alternative selfish strategy exists that is more profitable at any mining pool size. The larger the latency, the greater the selfish mining benefit: 


3) Mining simulations run by Pieter Wuille shows that well-connected peers making a majority of the hashing power have an advantage over less-connected ones, earning more profits per hash. Larger blocks even further favor these well-connected peers. This gets even worse as we shift from block subsidy to fee based reward :


4) Other point(s):
If there is no blocksize cap, a miner should simply snipe the fees from the latest block and try to stale that block by mining their own replacement. You get all the fees plus any more from new transactions. Full blocks gives less reward for doing so, since you have to choose which transactions to include.
And probably more I forgot.
Honestly though if you think datacenter Bitcoin is interesting, or will avoid regulation, you're a bit confused. You're just going to get a shitty Paypal. Maybe ask Gavin why he's against the datacenter model?

Indeed. I make sure to scope the claims as such. Not claiming they are correct in reality. Maybe it's my previous academia life, but I really like to *understand* what's going on from the ground floor. 


We very likely don't get a "redo" if Bitcoin fails due to centralization. It's hard to gather practical evidence of system failure when it hasn't happened yet. I'd rather not risk crossing the line until we understand things better.  
I'm not arguing for a specific number, I'm just saying there are very real centralization effects.

@_date: 2015-08-04 13:27:34
We may be talking past each other. Do you mean blocks, size held constant, but verification made more difficult?  
Because larger blocks by definition are slower, and can be used to push out smaller miners.   
If you're just making blocks with harder to verify scripts, that could possibly just lose you money since you're not picking up fees. I'm not sure.

It's kind of a semantic game, depending on what you choose "n" to be.  (i.e. n being number of users means it certainly isn't O(n) but the final amount depends on how much economic activity each person does.)
It's good enough to say that Bitcoin, as-is, simply can-not fulfill the world's demands for transactions. 8GB aren't even close to large enough. (I honestly think 4MB would be slightly too large for today. I'm just throwing out goal numbers for demonstration.)  
LN gets it somewhat closer to O(n) in a sense, because people could hold a small number of channels for indefinite periods while still doing many transactions.
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:51:05

Sounds like an optimization problem that businesses handle every day, no? End points will open up "lines of credit" at different fee rates. Hubs may even crowd-fund and give interest as a reward. Less efficient hubs will lose out in the end. End-users will have pretty simple choices to make.
More complex than "everyone remember my coffee purchase forever" sure, but it's simple compared to modern finance.  
Privacy in these hubs will be interesting. From what I understand, Chaumian e-cash can be bolted on top of these systems as well. You can tell the hub "pay up" without the hub knowing who the money is coming from. Worst case, take your paycheck on-chain I suppose.

The hub is tying up their own bitcoin as well, which means it can't be used elsewhere for other capital purposes. It's not a free lunch. It's like saying a bank has to have 100% shared deposits with their customers. It's going to be a balancing act.  
As long as a chain of channels reaches to and from the destination, it works, assuming each hub has the liquidity.

SPV mining gets them 1-2% extra profit at 1MB blocks, so this snafu only lost them a bit of profit.  
Provided their code isn't broken in the future, and they eventually reject blocks that are incomplete/invalid, we should be fine.
@_date: 2015-08-03 14:41:37
The decentralization is (mostly) to make sure that transactions aren't censored. One miner may not like your transaction, but he needs a 51%+ majority to censor rather than just the one guy.  
You can take a look at Blockstream's sidechains with blocksigning as the model you are describing. The only bad thing the signers can do is simply refuse to include transactions in a block they don't like. Which is why it doesn't replace Bitcoin.

Old full nodes are much less SPV than "full" SPV.  
It does demonstrate why re-democratizing mining is important of course. In the extreme any 51% of mining power can censor all they like as long as their interests align for a particular purpose. This isn't new. 
Regardless, if there is a large hash split of two chains you find valid, you should be careful.

I don't think the "cost" is the issue. It's things like block latency, signature checking all those transactions, and other related issues. We've already seen how this damages the network at a measly 1MB.  
Sure I like being able to run a full node on an old laptop, but that's not really the point.  
The more resources it takes, the fewer people will do it, and the more resources will be diverted away from useful security work(hashing) and towards non-useful work (infrastructure).

Let's focus on reality instead of fantasy.  


I don't think that's what ignorant means. I think you mean "sad" or "inconvenient". 
A correctly-acting wallet should be pre-signing a number of transactions, and trying a the lower-guessed fee rate first. If it doesn't get through "quickly" it will release another transaction. 
@_date: 2015-07-09 12:46:00
It's just a way of passing coins to another chain. These sidechains have less security than the main chain, so they should be used for experiments, like the Elements project, or for private chains where you have known signers rather than miners and are ok with some trust.

In large or small blocks, minimum fee amounts can be prescribed by any X amount you'd like on a node by node basis. Someone can just keep sending fee bumps of transactions, costing them bits but "wasting" your bandwidth as a node.  
The cost of an "attack" is roughly the same in both situations, everything else held constant.  
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:23:46
kind of cute.  
More seriously, there may be a good multisig scheme or opt-in to let something like this happen. Mistakes do indeed happen!

Good or not it's basically impossible to stop.  
Here is some bitcoin-wizard lore:   
In my opinion, ASICs are impossible to stop, so might as well cross the threshold once, and adapt once ASICs become cheap and widespread. Vast majority of cost is electricity.

@_date: 2015-07-25 20:36:00
Watch the talks; they're much clearer there.  


I think the increased fees they can capture given more liquidity only goes so high. At some point other uses for that capital and/or people's preferences for more liquidity diverge. No one knows where that would be.   


You could but each channel you set up / take down is 2 transactions on-chain. So if transactions cost $1, it really doesn't make sense versus using a chain of micro-fees.

These days I'd highly recommend you use a hardware wallet instead, or Android wallet.  
They're much more peer reviewed, and don't have the sticky issue of how to spend the funds when the time comes to take it out of cold storage. Paper wallets have a huge problem where the computer you sweep keys to must be secure, so why not just have it on computers in the first place?

The software should figure out routing, much like packets route through the internet. 
So whatever you say you want to pay for, assuming there is a path, you can instantly with very small fees. (If competition is good it will just pay for their electricity costs and whatnot)

Whoever you are routing through. For all I know these will end up being free up to a certain number of transactions. Marginal cost should be tiny. (Routing packets plus digital signatures plus overhead)

You may need to rephrase this. I don't understand the scenario.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:43:54
For now, yes. If someone passes you the same exact transaction again, holding it in memory allows you to not forward it yet again. It's also used today to discourage double-spending, although it's not foolproof.  
Eventually it could also mean that when receiving new blocks you don't need to be sent those data again. (I don't think that's optimized yet for the normal p2p network?)
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:00:18
Only if the low-resource people have some unknown amount of economic strength in the ecosystem. Otherwise they are cut off from fully validating the chain and have to trust others to do so.

@_date: 2015-07-25 16:45:50
They could do consulting for things like private sidechains and the like. (If you trust the federated signers in your little private sidechain, that allows for high amount of txn/s that can then directly interface with Bitcoin proper, for example. Not everyone needs 100% Bitcoin trustless-ness.) 
They could run a Lightning Network hub.  
I'm sure they've thought of many more.

In fact there are legit papers on this topic!  
  
And that doesn't even consider that the best thing for miners isn't the best thing for the system overall! Miners could make out like bandits while actual users get the shaft. Selfish mining and block withholding against pools are great examples.  
Honestly I think an issue in these parts is that many people who consider themselves economists here are "Austrian", aka don't want to do math. I'm too lazy to do the math myself, but I respect those who take the time to actually work it out.
@_date: 2015-07-11 12:03:43
That's a bad idea.  
1) Address re-use  
2) People tend to forget to send change back to the address and send their whole funds as fees.  
If you're ok with violating  sweep it, spend on real wallet, then when you're done send the rest back to the paper wallet address.  
That said, if you are kind of newbie, I think paper wallets have huge security and usability problems. It's better to find a multisig online solution and use that tbh.

Well if the other side doesn't even want to eat a burger, or thinks they can wait a few more hours to eat, that changes leverage ;)  
More seriously, there are other BIPs out there, but very little agreement on metrics when/where growth should stop. For example, BlueMatt is very concerned about any auto-growth due to the non-linear nature of internet latency wrt bandwidth increases. I don't know if his fears are well-founded, but I take his opinion seriously due to his work on mining relay network. Others are ok with increasing along with upload bandwidth growth in a linear fashion. I hope we'll see a coherent metrics put together at the scaling workshop.  
Something like Pieter's fork, maybe with a little faster up front growth, and a detailed set of metrics on when soft-forking down would be necessary(as per scaling workshop).

They're almost completely orthogonal.  
Which is why:  


Is just head-scratchingly dumb. No one ever said the blocksize, outside of needing consensus to pay fees, enforces anything in the p2p realm.  
Also where did you get this double/halving figure? I can construct a P2P mempool policy that is directly proportional to blocksize differences.  
1MB blocks, means on average as a P2P node I can cut down to basically 1MB of transactions on average(just take the top-paying transactions), if I'm cut-throat about it. 100MB blocks must be at least 100MB, obviously.  
I'm getting the feeling this is yet another "no but Bitcoin today works like X and it must be until the end of time" Hearn-style arguments. Which I'm not interested in at all. I'm interested in the security of the blockchain.

As much as I'm a fee-based guy, I do like having some priority to allow people to move UTXOs that "got too small" as Bitcoin appreciates in value. Maybe this just means people should combine UTXOs, especially if/when Confidential Transactions-style privacy is enabled.

No my point is that SPV mining an empty block will no longer be preferable. Miners will have to wait until they have a full block to mine the next block, or simply won't make any money. Puts the winning block maker(or a node that found out about the block before others) at a huge advantage.
@_date: 2015-07-09 01:19:08

Indeed. It's the reason I took issue with your absolutist statement.

Demonstrating functionality allowing for the cheapest fee bumps to make sure your transaction gets propagated/mined.

I know it's really hard to computer SHA256 on paper I've been spending all day on it. I really wonder if there's a way to automate any of this!? Please halp.  
More seriously though, this is relay policy. Either your node crashes, or it has to selectively forget/drop things. This policy means that things "sent before" are preferred, and then as you get full you start only accepting based on fee. As long as there are beefy nodes out there the transactions will probably make it through like usual.
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:20:42
They'll hold value as far as they are valued(which will be less during an active fork). You're probably going to have to double-spend them across chains to make sure you can sell one, or both sets.  
@_date: 2015-07-23 14:30:10
And once block subsidy goes towards zero, I assume this effect becomes essentially unbounded again. No one will want to mine on blocks they haven't seen, leading to huge advantages. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:59:34
the issue with this is figuring out what the right fee is. If it's a consensus rule you just can't set a fee level any time you like.
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:19:46
Is that a lot? Can you compare the rates you are getting from Bitcoin Core at the same time?  
Average transaction is roughly 250 Bytes or so. 1204/4 = 301 bits in fees -&gt; 8 cents fee. That's not wildly high for getting in the next block. (my napkin math may be off).

Wait, what? If I undershoot my fees, I can't move my funds in the cheapest way because we've decided as a community that protecting 0-conf is more important. Right now there is no real way of upping your transaction fee aside from sending it directly to a mining pool with a bumped fee.

There are various ways of ameliorating the problem, but imo nothing satisfactory. Everything ends up as a grinding problem, or "phone a friend" consensus to tell what the true chain is.  
For example, Ethereum's PoS scheme essentially gave up on distributed consensus in favor of "phone a friend" consensus. You can draw your own inferences about the pros and cons of that approach.

Assuming their system is secure, which is a large assumption, theoretically interesting applications could be developed on top. Something like an (unbroken) Augur I guess. Still haven't heard any great examples, but I'm sure they exist somewhere.  
Almost all interesting contracting seems to already exist in Bitcoin, or nearly. Aside from a prediction market, which could be very interesting, and is being developed as a sidechain.

More computer science. Less noise.  
edit: Ooh, MDPs  
Discussion of block latencies' effect on minimum power necessary to profit from selfish mining:  


blocks which it publishes may arrive at the honest network too late, which
potentially reduces the benefit of block withholding.  
2. Natural forks occur within the honest network, and consequently its chain
grows in a rate lower than one block per round; this potentially makes attacks
more successful.  
3. Natural forks involving the attacker imply that the game arrives at nontrivial
states, even under honest mining. The attacker may thus mine honestly
until some particular deviation becomes feasible.  
4. In the presence of delays, the attacker’s share under honest mining might be
greater than α, which raises the bar for dishonest strategies to prevail.  
...  


the profit threshold equals 0. In other words, every attacker benefits from some
form of dishonest mining.  
...  


we’ve seen (Section 5), those dominate SM1 in that they delay adoption, i.e.,
they allow the continuation of the attack even when the honest network’s chain
is longer than the attacker’s. While the additional benefit was rather mild, this
added feature becomes more important in networks with delays, where splits
in the chain occur naturally with some probability, even when honest mining is
practiced by all.  
To gain further understanding of selfish mining under delays it would be
important to quantify the optimal gains from such deviations. We leave this as
an open question for future research. Still, it is clear that Bitcoin will be more
vulnerable to selfish mining if delays become more prominent, e.g., in the case
of larger blocks (block size increases are currently being discussed within the
Bitcoin developers community).
Doesn't this also mean that an attacker who actively attacks the network via DDoS makes this more profitable? (or is that literally what the /gamma parameter is? I can't remember)  
Given the fact that we're already doing headers-first mining, how much of an issue is this really, aside from the already-present incentive issues and empty blocks that are mined?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:19:47

@_date: 2015-07-30 17:06:34

@_date: 2015-08-12 20:19:54
Some useful information, with plenty of salt.  
I remember reading a fairly long dev email list exchange on this very topic. Wish I could find it because it's enlightening.  
edit: I think a lot of the problems of soft forks vs hard forks are solved by simply using a bit to announce it's changing. If you see a bit flip, and have no idea why, you need to consult the meta-consensus. A malicious soft fork is a problem regardless, and Mike simply saying "they're bad" won't stop malicious miners from doing one. I have a feeling that a contentious soft fork to increase the blocksize limit would be just as debated as a hard-fork.  
edit2: His handwave about hard forks destroying bitcoin is pretty silly. If he somehow managed to get just 75% of the mining power behind XT, and decided to do his checkpointing to make sure his fork is kept, of course it would irrevocably damage the network. I guess he means that a soft fork war would be similar?
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:04:54
I like something like this. First we need to decide the base value (4? 2?) Then we need to decide what a soft forking condition would be if it outpaces technical advancement.
Hoping the scaling workshop will be illuminating on the latter point.

I find it weird that we must raise the blocksize dramatically now, but it won't be filled for X so don't worry.  
If we're raising it to 8MB, I'd better be able to handle 8MB. That's how security works, and who knows, maybe Bitcoin will go to the moon. I'd rather be ready. Running a full node shouldn't  
Therefore, my older laptop running a Tor HS node would need an upgrade in short order, and I'd be tempted to not run a full node on my smaller-SSD work laptop, or I'd spill a few hundred to get a 1TB drive.

2) They publish on the Bitcoin blockchain to get all the security advantages, but miners do not have to enforce the inner-logic of these systems. Instead individuals that participate have to verify that "chain" of instructions themselves. Also called: Embedded consensus systems.

That's fine and dandy, but people use this to dismiss any expert opinions they give, and frankly the conspiracy theory doesn't make sense. 
I've seen many extremely ugly attacks on the people who have been propping up Bitcoin Core for years. It's bizarre to think that they're working for much less than they could get at a large company to sabotage Bitcoin for... financial gain? They could easily triple their pay by joining a financial firm. Do people understand what traditional finance pays?

(only a few people said this, but for some reason it was tolerated)  
Blockstream's stated goals and what they are actually doing is by far the most innovative stuff in the space. No group comes even close. Even if merge-mined chains never really take off, private/federated chains are basically what Open Transactions were supposed to be(now defunct), and Lightning Networks on the main chain for extreme volume batch settlement. Not to mention the list of kickass enhancements like Segregated Witness/CT.  
Meanwhile, is throwing shit at people who have spent hundreds of man hours keeping bitcoind afloat at 1MB, because it would have burned down long ago otherwise.

Incorrect. You relay and verify transactions that have a prayer of getting included in a block. We already drop transactions below a dust limit, and have a min relay fee. It's already being done for what you consider "spam". We're just going to do it more. 
I've actually changed my mind. A larger blocksize puts a lower minimum on the amount of traffic you must carry to keep in consensus. It clearly necessitates more resources.   
@_date: 2015-07-25 17:13:45
Software should be handling this for you. (when's the last time you manually digitally signed a transaction? ;P )

The reasons for the drop are beside the point: There is simply no mapping from users to full nodes, and if there is, it appears to be negative. Your comment has no bearing on reality.

To quickly answer the fee question: if people find ways to avoid paying fees they will. It's a weird critique to lay the fault at LN if it succeeds. People are avoiding fees today at huge volume by using centralized, walled garden services and that will never change. Other people need the confirmations and will pay to get them. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 14:55:29
That chart is kind of meaningless as there are transactions streaming in at all time. People have large time preferences, meaning they're trying to get "next block" for whatever reason. If you have low time preferences you're already going to be near the bottom of the mempool.
Yes you can look at mempool stats, guess, and hope that there isn't a bad run of blocks. As long as you have an RBF-enabled wallet.

@_date: 2016-02-12 17:54:52
Sorry to rain on parade, but it's policy only, meaning mempool will enforce it only. And it's not OP_CSV, that's coming next:   
As a first step for many softforks based on NOPs, they run as mempool policy to make sure nothing funny happens, and that legacy nodes will see fewer and fewer future-invalid transactions.
But, great news! Things are moving forward! Maybe we'll get a SegWit/OP_CSV mega-softfork rolled out :X

This means people apparently don't want more space, because they're not upgrading. You upgrade, you get the space.


The fee is directly proportional to the space, it's just a linear weighting. Just as easy to pack blocks and estimate needed fee.  


True, but the 4MB can't be just digital signatures or what have you, since they are still sigop capped, and none of that block would enter the UTXO set. Don't forget that the sigops we still have are also O(n) sighashing instead of O(n^2 ). Classic/XT et al had to simply disallow certain types of transactions instead of actually fixing the problem.  


The real attack vector is sigops, and O(n^2 ) scaling. That attack has been neutered by SegWit. 


I don't follow. A naive blocksize bump would be quadraticly worse.

He is being willfully blind.  
There is absolutely no way the network, even with 5 years of great engineering, could handle such large amounts. We are struggling at &lt;1MB. The incentives in mining today are to centralize, and it only gets stronger the larger we go. Perhaps in some mystical future we could scale like that, but that's sci-fi today.

Yes, one way would be to drop the witness commitment altogether, but then you can never be sure if a block is actually invalid due to invalid witness. Would have to rewrite a bunch of p2p stuff and rethink DoS protection from ground up.

Free transactions are charity by miners. They'll almost certainly disappear. Low fees require nearly unlimited blocksize compared to demand.
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:21:45


Our transaction size and number of users have gone up an order of magnitude, yet out full node count dropped just as much.  
Hosted wallets are now a supermajority of wallets, followed by SPV wallets, which can't validate history. No reason to think making it more difficult to run a full node would make this number any higher.
@_date: 2015-07-24 13:11:04
Obviously this is quite far out, but what about the economic argument that we have no other method of funding network security than fees from scarcity?

We can measure, for example, 95% of market liquidity on open orderbooks however. And get a rough estimate of transaction volume. It's hard, but not impossible I think.

No, I'm asking what you're looking for.
UASF only makes sense if you completely divorce it from miner signaling. If we're looking for hashrate majority, it's just a much weaker BIP9.
Jury is still out, but I'm UASF-curious. Miners are deeply confused what miner signaling is for, and there seems to be no way of correcting this aside from UASF.

Lying may be a harsh way of saying it, but forwarding this "cheap payment network" as fact when it's hotly contested and probably wrong is bad.


How is this trolling? This is literally how Bitcoin works.  


Same. Fees are how we indicate time preferences.  


"In the not-so-distant future I assume ordinary users would be using wallets that both estimate necessary fees (as a function of desired confirmation time) and have the ability to replace with a higher fee if your transaction is stuck. So it will still be a question of how much they're willing to pay to get a transaction through; it won't be a case where you'd be strictly locked out. The more responsive the market becomes to fees, the more expensive an effective "DDoS" attack would become. It's relatively "cheap" now because most wallets aren't responsive at all and things like FSSRBF aren't that common."  
Um, this is just stating a particular vision of Bitcoin. One that most core devs share.  




I must have missed where this was refuted, as the entire security model in Bitcoin is based on PoW.

I don't recall that "classic" version of it but with OP_CLTV it goes something like this:  
1) Set up 2-of-2 channel, pre-signing a refund of that channel something like 1000 blocks in the future.  
2) Now user A wants to pay user B. He partially signs a new version of the transaction that gives more.  
3) Step 2 repeats 100 times or whatever.  
4) If A wants to cheat, he has no old fully signed transaction to submit except for the refund!  
5) User B can doddle, then eventually sign and transmit the latest version of the payout, before the 1000 blocks are up.  
With relative locktime it gets even better, since A would post a refund attempt, then after *that* B can respond with their own version with 1000 blocks of safety. 
The non-OP_CLTV version relies on nLockTime transactions, which are a bit more finicky:

The vast majority of research demonstrates that blocksize does matter, blocksize caps are required to secure the network, and large blocks are a centralizing pressure. Here’s a short list of what has been published so far:
**1)** No blocksize cap and no minimum fee leads to catastrophic breakage as miners chase marginal 0 fees: 


It’s important to note that mandatory minimum fees could simply be rebated out-of-band, which would lead to the same problems.
2) a) Large mining pools make strategies other than honest mining more profitable: 


2) b) In the presence of latency, some alternative selfish strategy exists that is more profitable at any mining pool size. The larger the latency, the greater the selfish mining benefit: 


3) Mining simulations run by Pieter Wuille shows that well-connected peers making a majority of the hashing power have an advantage over less-connected ones, earning more profits per hash. Larger blocks even further favor these well-connected peers. This gets even worse as we shift from block subsidy to fee based reward :


4) Other point(s):
If there is no blocksize cap, a miner should simply snipe the fees from the latest block and try to stale that block by mining their own replacement. You get all the fees plus any more from new transactions. Full blocks gives less reward for doing so, since you have to choose which transactions to include.
**Please send any literature you find on the topic to me so I can add it to the list.**

In general:  
1) Stick with wallets that have basically no past security problems. That means NO blockchain.info.  
2) Only use apps that don't auto-update. That means no to javascript web-wallets.  
3) Only run wallets that are 100% open source. No closed deployment followed by open-sourcing. 
  
I don't think you're going to get a ton of code reviews, tbh. Most these wallets are small, underfunded teams.
@_date: 2015-07-16 23:46:39
Let's all assume we are talking about merge-mined sidechains: Not only that, but users only get "SPV" security on these. Outright theft is a lot easier than in main Bitcoin(in the extreme a mining attack could roll back the chain and steal a ton of coin, but unlikely).

Sort of.  
He capped the sized of transactions to 100KB, and explicitly counted and capped the number of bytes hashed in signature operations.  
SegWit means you don't have to do hacky caps on transaction sizes and fewer attacks. Also in the future(and Gavin agrees here) that we should move to a linear weighting of various factors instead of these hard rules, because they're harder to optimize for.

Now the real question is how do we fairly give all participating miners the transactions for fees? P2P network at least makes it quite hard to censor them.

While I think this is a sincere question, I also think it's a bit of question-begging. AFAIK those types of users are quite a-political, and if economic endpoints are all on a chain and software just works as-is, they will go along with it.
For a safe UASF you'd need ~95% exchange liquidity, wallet offerings, etc.
The remaining fact is that if that's not enough, we shouldn't be doing BIP9 signaling activation either!

If someone uses bcoin as a miner/full node validator, it will likely be incompatible with blocks made by Satoshi codebase. Therefore using Core as a "filter" for the network would make it much safer.

@_date: 2016-02-22 15:15:52


That would be a massive privacy leak, because you could "track" someone's spending by modeling it that way.  
In Core today the default is to use an approximate knapsack solver that that is randomized. This preserves privacy a bit, and allows the user to find a pretty low-fee transaction to send.  
Check the code to make sure I'm correct if you like:

Pruned nodes essentially already do this.  
The UTXO set holds onto unspent coins, and are pruned as they are spent.
@_date: 2016-09-23 18:18:54
hardware wallets can't calculate change unless they can see and validate the entire previous transactions' outputs(which contain the values explicitly). This could be huge amounts of data for small memory-constrained devices. Simple using the value inside the hashing of the transaction the hardware is making means worst-case it's simply an invalid transaction and fails to spend, rather than dumping to fees.
@_date: 2016-02-08 15:33:59
UTXO commitments effectively do that. You can simply ignore blocks earlier than you care about, with the reduction in security that it has.

That's a social engineering attack though, for the most part. A realistic one of course. But if you let your Ledger/Trezor out of your control and an attacker simply replaces it? Seems to be effectively the same thing.
My 2 cents: People should still factor in physical security and make sure that randos aren't screwing with their devices. If there is, destroy the device.

what's the error?
@_date: 2017-04-11 14:36:22
The only reason we care about a large buffer for miners is due to &lt;random events&gt; and protecting users who haven't updated software from short reorgs.
Ideally(I'd argue essential in this day and age), a BIP9 deployment would also have enough "fuzzy economic votes", segwit being a perfect example.

Yes but:
1) It's a hack. Current paradigm of figuring out if you have funds or not conflates a few things, so I have to just trick the wallet into thinking keys are local, then hack around that to have it sign. There are some ideas on how to move to a better paradigm, hopefully will discuss them soon with interested devs.  
2) I'd like to re-do all this to use [BIP174]( which is a proposed standard for these types of use-cases.
That said it's a perfectly serviceable stand-alone wallet solution.

The risk of premature upgrade(installing binaries without verifying where they come from resulting in possible theft) likely outweigh the risks of your node crashing for another day, unless you are a business(who should know how to build/validate rc3).
To be clear: The risk of social attack is much higher now, since people are more willing to believe some unsigned binary is the real deal and will want to protect themselves from DoS. Stay calm and follow normal security procedure.

Great initial writeup Rusty  
All this talk of hub-spoke networks makes me optimistic that reasonable scaling solutions exist.
@_date: 2015-04-24 12:43:14
Sure. Anyone who wants the full security of the network will run a full node. If not enough run it, it probably means bitcoin failed.

People have different visions for Bitcoin, and it's obvious by the "arguments".  
I've written up some posts to put some sanity back in the discussion, but until we can agree on things like "hitting max cap isn't the worst thing ever" these arguments will never be resolved and the "scale now!!!" calls will get louder.

Complexity is a huge one.  
If you read the Lightning Network paper they list a number of corner cases one would have to be careful about. Deals with opening/closing the channels mostly.
@_date: 2015-04-01 17:16:20
The idea is to get millions of docs hashed into one digest then put on the blockchain. People paying for it on-chain would kind of defeat that purpose.  
(Not totally sold on their architecture but that's the reasoning)
@_date: 2015-04-02 11:10:27
The system is not distributed consensus because trusted bootstrapping means identities are required.  
Most likely result is some central identity controlling the coin completely, just like Peercoin with centralized checkpointing, except "phone a friend" style.

You "tie up" some bits with Gyft, or a hub-spoke payment processor, then any time you want to buy something from Gyft you partially sign a new transaction, and hand it to them.  
Once you want the rest of your money back you either ask them to "cash it" or wait until the refund transaction becomes live(if they don't respond).

@_date: 2015-04-15 14:53:12
  
Check out the slides. That's an advanced version of what he's talking about.  
Scaling bitcoin without blowing up the blockchain is certainly possible.  
edit: Using the blockchain as an anchor for off-chain transactions/negotiations/whatever seems to be an extremely powerful concept that hasn't really been fleshed out. This keeps the decentralization of Bitcoin intact while scaling it to VISA levels easily. (to be clear, you still need blocks large enough that people can open up the channel and close, once a year or two) Needless to say this is the most exciting opportunity to grow Bitcoin. Finally: fast, basically free, trustless payments!

Well it's easier to logically think about. I can't say "it isn't longer" because some pool on its own could mine a single block. 6 just means it'd have to be the dominant chain.  
As for "why not a successful hard fork in 6 months"? Because blocks aren't even close to full yet, and most core devs aren't convinced they need to expand block size immediately.

Two groups of people can come to two completely different chains. The decentralization is surely not broken, it's the consensus part that is. However in a practical setting people are just going to opt to use the chain the developer claims is the legit chain, resulting in an entirely centralized system. The cost of forking means massive double-spending and mayhem.  
For the money part to work we really need to have consensus.

Not that I don't agree with your skepticism, but this isn't quite the narrative, or even particularly true anymore. A number of pools are at 1MB cap(including the top two pools, well, if you count "Unknown" as a pool). A vast majority are now at 750kB+. The pools today are extremely well-connected, and are using the Block Relay Network. 
The conflict will further go away as block reward shrinks and txn fees are a larger share.  
Not to say the scaling doesn't suck for the reason that everyone must know the entire state at all times.  
I am *not* a fan of Gavin's plan, and his apocalyptic visions of hitting the max cap.

Gavin your gut instincts do not replace actual research:  
  
I was fairly resistant to the idea that marginal fees wouldn't fund the network, but the theory is all pointing a single direction and I've changed my mind. The network will have to be useful enough to fill up the max block size, or have a proper minimum fee(very often called "cartel pricing" in discussions).

With this system, even without a block size increase, we could service about 110 million inter-locked channels, if everyone opened and closed a channel once every 2 years. Essentially unlimited transactions between end-points, for basically free.  
That's astounding.

Check your assumptions then. Unless there is some strong(er) time assumptions in the system, it's impossible to stop. It costs no more to re-write a chain than it did to original write it, *unless you add extra assumptions like time*.  
"Just reject reorgs" and its variants are not distributed consensus because a bootstrapping node can not join the consensus set without trust.  
And with this, I'm done wasting my time. If you can't agree the security model has different assumptions there is nothing to talk about until you do.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:15:43


Exactly. We have no idea, but we have a fair bit understanding of the downsides of going too large. I'm not the one prescribing a size. It's a political question, and everyone has their own opinion. Personally I am certainly incredulous to your doubling-every-X proposal on a number of levels. We have *so many* technologies we can use to scale Bitcoin without making an essentially infinite blocksize(and will need to happen anyways), but you think hitting max blocksize is Armageddon so we can never agree to disagree.  
Circling back: *You* are the one proposing un-conservative changes. The onus is on *you* to demonstrate your case. If you come back with a scaled back, single-time proposal, I'm listening.


Your assumption that there is additional hashing being essentially donated by a few large corporations. That's fine, I guess in some way, and in fact my optimistic future involves something like this*, but it's folly to build out your system assuming this. And somehow someone is going to have to pay for this, so we could just consider this "out of band" payment type stuff.   
*1 million people mining a tiny bit at a loss would greatly secure the network, for example. Everyone who wants to have the "full power" of the network can mine at any policy they like.

Long story short: It's not distributed consensus. "Phone a friend" consensus systems may work, but will certainly centralize. Who would ever disagree with a checkpoint the main devs pick?
If we want to re-introduce trust, we should really just go back to the drawing board instead of using a terribly inefficient system like Bitcoin. Distributed consensus appears to take both time and energy.

The point is there *would be no sharing*. (modulo altruism)
There is pressure to under-bid using the direct payment method(since you're competing with people who are paying key block miner 40% of their fees, then 60% to next miner), so people will do so.(unless altruistic magic)  
In the extreme no sharing will happen, and you'll be back to incentive-questionable basics since it's trivial to just orphan txn blocks(you can still build on the latest key block header). You're relying on other miners being nice to you once you've mined a block. Not great. The solution ends up probably being more problematic than the original symptoms. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 01:58:19

I told you it has SPV-like security. The exact mechanism involves an SPV-style PoW proof to redeem coins(the proof is the PoW). I don't know the exact syntax of the required opcodes.  
This means miners have much more power, and a temporary 51% attack on the sidechain can literally steal coins from people, rather than just the block subsidy. That's why there is such a long wait on coins being moved between chains. Requires a longer and longer attack to pull it off.  
Also, imagine there are 10k different sidechains. The head-ache of setting that up means most people won't actually validate those chains when mining(trusting a pool or service). We want people validating while mining.

There is clearly fundamental tension in blocksize vs fee market, but today the main constraint is clearly technical. It just doesn't scale yet and doesn't appear the current architecture as a whole can rapidly. This is why there's so much excitement for things like LN.


The paper actually said nothing about long term transaction fees providing security, even if you believe the paper. It just said that blocksizes will be finite based on orphan risk, which under certain assumptions is pretty obvious but doesn't answer the longer term security question.  
This whole "debate" has exhausted much of the patience for explaining the same issues over and over, especially when Mike just refuses to engage in them by calling them "theoretical" and spreads propaganda nonsense. Go look at what Mike has proposed in the past, and the PR he is complaining about not getting included to Core. He is the butt-hurt one because his ideas are bad and have been roundly rejected ecosystem-wide. I merely disagree with Gavin. Mike is a toxic agent of destruction.

Merge-minded(which is often what people are talking about) doesn't help scaling at all. 1MB + 19MB merge-mined sidechain would be much worse than 20MB main chain for centralization. You get the weakened security model of merge-mined chains along with miners still being required to mine for the fees to stay competitive.   
OTOH the signatory-based ledgers could indeed off-load since that doesn't centralize Bitcoin mining at all. Sort of like Open Transactions. I actually think this could be a huge application in the short-term to relieve on-chain backlog along with LN until we figure out magic tree-chains or somesuch.

Unfortunately it's broked :(  
  
TL;DR: You can't enforce the fee-sharing scheme as wallets can simply switch to paying miners through other undetectable means. This means miners can simply take all the fees, leaving none for the following miner. So the following miner will simply snipe txn blocks or orphan them.  
This weakness appears to exist anytime you try and use fees in consensus rules beyond money adding up. Mandatory fees, fee smoothing, etc.
@_date: 2015-09-20 19:50:43
So miners will just orphan blocks that they "think" are out of band paying? What about a txn that has .8 in fees included? .7?  
You're counting on fee payers to pay enough fees to not encourage massive orphan wars. The whole point of the sharing was to avoid this. It seems to have failed.

Let's say the going rate for a transaction is a 1 BTC fee. (damn small-blockers!)  
That means .4 BTC is going to previous keyblock miner (A) and .6 BTC goes to next keyblock miner (B).  
Instead I as a user send a "free" transaction that sends an additional .5 BTC output to a well-known address for miner (A). Miner (A) includes my transaction. Miner (B) gets nothing for building on top of it.

[Ledger Nano S]( is probably the best bang-for-buck hardware wallet out there. You can use that for a lot more safety.  
You can also simply run a [Bitcoin Core]( instance to make sure you don't get double-spent, and know your coins are actually yours!
Whatever you do, make sure you back up your wallet! 
@_date: 2015-09-09 14:37:10


If the new transaction is low fee/low priority, it is dropped. “Low fee” means it doesn’t pay high enough fees to get in within the next two blocks according to the fee estimator.  
Otherwise space is cleared for it by selecting a random transaction and any that depend on it, and then removing them.  
Sounds ok I guess.  


Is he saying there is no such thing as time preferences? I am willing to wait generally, therefore I can pay less.  


The Bitcoin protocol has *nothing* to do with this. It's easily fixed by full RBF *today*. Though I'm assuming he doesn't want that which means FSS-RBF which is much more complicated.   
The great news is anyone can run any policy they like.

You might like flexcap then. Allows natural growth(people willing to pay fees) to be reflected in blocksize.
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:48:01
If we could safely send around infinite size blocks without any centralization pressure, what may happen?  
Answer: We may not get enough security by fees, because rational miners would literally add any transaction. The only way we know today how to ensure hashing gets done is to restrict blocksize to get fees.  
(Block subsidy can be worked around via embedded consensus some day in the future, especially perhaps post-snarks, and mandatory minimum transaction fees can be refunded out-of-band)

Imagine what would happen if someone created a 100MB merge-mined sidechain that became incredibly popular and had a lot of fees. What would happen?

Modern PoS systems essentially disallow trustless initial syncing with the network to get around the fundamental issues. It's a way, I guess, but not distributed consensus.

2) Miners may flip bits to not being orphaned off, then ignore what they consider invalid blocks later. If I'm a miner and don't agree with the hardfork, I'd literally do this. 
It's not safe for miners, it's not safe for nodes, it's not safe for the currency.

I mean, you could redefine an opcode as a op_schnorr and still do something similar. It's just a bit more annoying to code and test.

Only setting up a channel and closing a channel costs regular Bitcoin transaction. Closing channels will probably only happen rarely if done right. Keeping channels open means you get to charge microfees, and can get paid through it.

This is a "cheat" although safe one: it just validates fewer old blocks on startup. It was doing a ridiculous 288 blocks of rollback-rollforward to make sure everything is in the database kosher. Now it does I believe 6.

Everyone will be a hub. The amount of liquidity you have, meaning the bitcoin you "lock up", both lets you spend more inside the system and get fees from people spending "through" you.  


You're right, if everyone you link up with is a disreputable scoundrel, it won't be very useful. But the idea is that most people will play along on average, and you pay ~nothing when that happens since you can keep a channel open basically forever. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:57:08
But the transaction will probably be buried in the blockchain. So unless SHA256 is broken as well, they are safe. (unless the computer crack them within minutes, then it's all broken)  
Regarding the "escrow" thing? Looks like a "naked" multisig, instead of p2sh. I don't think those are very common. P2SH multisig hashes all of the redeemscript, making it safer.

Since only miners decide what time to put in the timestamp in a block, you'd need to attack with lots of hashpower to skew it. Other nodes run by "honest" participants will simply reject too-far-ahead timestamps either way.

Each output costs money to send, so you're going to pay out the nose to redeem because it's a larger transaction.

It's the hash of the block header only, not the entire block.  


The header includes the merkle root hash, which proves the inclusion of the merkle tree. No need to hash 4MB of data.  
It still takes time to construct the merkle tree, but it isn't related to mining really.

CPFP is nearly N times as expensive as full RBF for a N bumps, requiring you to make a whole new transaction for each bump attempt. It's pretty nasty in the degenerate case.  
First-Seen-Safe RBF gets it down to adding in a new UTXO to the transaction for bumping fee. Full RBF doesn't require any new data, necessarily. 
CPFP may be useful in specific cases though. It's good to have all the tools available.

Ah, fair points.
To take it further, if you want FSS RBF and rapid spending without chaining, you're going to need a LOT of UTXOs and manage them smartly.  
With FSS the UTXOs you use to make rapid payments should be in a different "pile" than the ones you use to bump fees.  
Doable, but again... more work! (and fees, and utxo set)

I took this to mean we'd never have a real block limit, other than a hand-wavy top amount. Miners can and will continue to squeeze in more transactions when they can. Heck, miners could fill blocks themselves using fake transactions if the policy they want is more space. If you believe the theory once the block subsidy goes away we won't have enough security if we're not hitting a cap of real usage(or miners don't cartel in a min fee).  


The fact is that we'll need "enough" fees to secure the network, without breaking decentralization. That is really tricky, and easy to get wrong. There are many other solutions, as detailed in many other places. Open Transactions, Lightning Network, among two of them.
@_date: 2015-11-19 22:07:04
We can always hardfork in a cleaner implementation later. At least that's my thought. We're going to be changing a ton of stuff already if it ever happens. (Why not just go all )


Properly validate using the new more restrictive rules, sure. But this was the same with P2SH. "Magic money" that you couldn't simply take for some reason. Bc.info didn't support p2sh for years!  
edit: I guess the bigger downside is you have to pass that extra info on the side, instead of sticking it on the scriptsig? Kind of sucks I suppose for p2p networking. Hm. Still, my hard fork point stands, I think :)

Unfortunately these connections are unauthenticated and unencrypted, so someone can intercept your communication and change what is being said or snoop easily.

Yes, indeed. And they will primarily compete via uptime. Locking up extra funds 


There is no theoretical limit to number of hops, but practical ones. With onion routing and other privacy features, you'll get something like 2RTT per hop IIRC. I've heard "up to 10 hops", on the order of seconds. I think fees will be extremely tiny because the marginal cost is so small.

Hard forks are more "strong-arming" than soft, at least when both are done "nicely".  
With a "nice" soft-fork you can simply ignore it for the most part, as long as you aren't mining.  
A "nice" hard fork still requires you to update no matter what.  
That said, eventually a hard fork will probably happen, and include a bunch of fixes.

SPV clients believe the longest chain of work, regardless of what's in it. Even if the blocksize is too large. They basically broadcast to everyone what funds you have. They also today are pretty easy to partition due to how they choose peers.

They are backwards compatible, but the older miners see a longer PoW chain they agree with. The newer miners will make blocks that old miners agree with, but will be shorter in total work!

No it won't. It barely changes anything. 350 transactions per second is hilariously small still. That's enough for every person on earth to do 1.5 transactions PER YEAR. Not even touching machine to machine payments. Risking the existence of Bitcoin for such small gains is lunacy.

No you don't, at least not naked ones.  
Greenaddress.it has one solution. Hub and spoke payment channels are another. Lightning Network is even better. All these options are supremely better than Hearn's solution, and replace-by-fee doesn't hurt any of these solutions.  
That doesn't even get around to the issue of non-RBF being a terrible UX for everything. Put too little fee? Oops! Wait a few days until it drops out of mempool! Oh, you allow limited replacement? Well, you need to marshal up another input since you can only add additional outputs since we don't know which outputs are change addresses. It's really ugly and is a loss of privacy unless you are *very* careful.


That is one version that probably would almost never be used.

Huh. Post got me thinking. I feel there are some nooks/crannies to explore but on its face seems right. (for example you are supposing a 100% liquid market of people being able to save in mining. No idea if that effects it) 
On -wizards there is the thought that mining *must* waste heat to be of any use, and that seems to conform with your theory.  
edit: You'd at least get a poop-ton of extra hashing power, such that people would have to either hijack these ASICs or run others to overcome the "true" chain. As long as it gets us closer to "one person one vote" it may be worthwhile, waste or not. Long-term as the block reward tends to zero, we're left with transaction fees, so even if we don't have a ton of fees to fund the network, the ledger is still pretty secure!  
TL;DR of my thoughts: You can possibly get the same amount of hashing security for less "waste" than today as the block reward goes to 0. Your conclusion holds if the block reward/total fees value stays the same forever.

Why does this gain us anything when in the end we want consensus?

The amount of coin sent in either direction can not exceed the amount that was locked up originally.  
However, you can re-balance by sending funds from another channel, or attempt to charge interest for being an intermediary.  
Most likely though I think people will just keep opening channels.

Basic hub-and-spoke models could work once malleability is fixed, so it's not too far out there. The Lightning Network stuff is more advanced, which allows for cools things like refreshing a channel for no extra cost and being nearly trustless.  
I've been trying to think what the limits are for off-chain transactions. I think a formal model of it is needed, like how we reason about Bitcoin proper.

As long as block propagation doesn't take more than a minute I really can't see it being much of an issue. The theory for consensus stability is "block time must be &gt;&gt;&gt; propagation time".

There is no "ideal" size. There are arguably "better", "worse" and "broken" sizes out there. And just because an alt says their max size is __ means very little. No one is even *close* to transaction velocity when compared to Bitcoin. Altcoins, for today, are day-trading coins.

I literally had to review the 3 PRs to understand it. 
It's not too bad:
1) First, treat nSequence numbers as nlocktimes on inputs rather than the whole transaction itself. So you can say "This can't be  included in the blockchain until input Y is X blocks deep"  
2) Second step is analogous to CLTV rolling out. Now we can put a required height in the script for an output(like CLTV). Future me wants to spend the funds, but the output that I'm trying to spend says I have to wait until the output is 144 blocks deep!  (specifically it says all the nSequence numbers from (1) must be larger than the script value plus height of that block the value is embedded, aka relative to that block)
\ is a further restriction on \ kind of a 2 layer soft-fork.

Unfortunately as-is, since the signature is included in the hash, and signatures can be tweaked without breaking verificaiton, it means anyone can :(  
Once inside the blockchain it merely becomes *expensive* since you have to roll back the blockchain to change it.  
There are various solutions to fixing it. My favorite, although would require a hard-fork, is Segregated Witness.   
It removes signatures from the whole equation, which is great. It also allows people to do initial sync without downloading any signatures, which is cool since those take up something like 2/3 the space.
@_date: 2015-10-26 18:56:13

Probably, but as a smartphone hub you probably don't want a lot of people pathing through you! They'll get upset if you are slow or go offlin


To be clear, they are *private* except to the people on the payment path, and onion routing should obfuscate a lot of this. You will probably be able to crawl the LN itself, meaning the nodes themselves and their open channels. You won't see much though.


You can make money by providing liquidity, yes. And also you have access to an instant payment network.  


No half measures. Every intermediary gets paid, or no one does.  


Depends on how long you set your funds to be locked up for. It's a blessing and a curse. One risk of LN is that the counter-party can send an older transaction and try to take more money back. You have X days to "respond" with a trump card that takes ALL the money from the channel when you prove the fraud.  
Therefore if the channel's timeout is something like 90 days, that gives the honest player 90 days to respond to a fraudulent transaction.
If both sides agree they can just close the channel right away.


You *could* send as much as you like if developers make it that way. It just seems dangerous to do that in experimental software. And why couldn't you wait 60 minutes for your 1,000 BTC to confirm? ;)


You got it. Fees can be &lt; 1 satoshi, just not trustless settling below that amount. You could do 1,000 transactions that result in a single satoshi fee which is then settled in the end. No one really knows what the fees will actually be. They will probably be freaking low because the minimal running costs and random altruists.

CLTV means that you can say "These funds can't be spent until block height X". So for example, GreenAddress(who I do some work for) can replace the nlocktime refund transaction(which users have to annoyingly hold onto and keep safe all the time) with simply allowing the funds to be spend with 1-of-2(your key only) after ~90 days.  
It can also be used in payment channels for the same reasons.

You're essentially using the network to validate "this is the latest version of the transaction" instead of using partially signed transactions with burning secrets.  
The core logic of who ultimately owns what when a channel is setup/broken down may by 100 lines, but certainly there would be far more code due to inter-node communication, fee negotiation, DoS resistance, onion routing, route finding etc. It's a statement essentially ignoring all the engineering :)  It's like saying "This plane is just two wings and an engine! So simple!"
If you take a look at LN implementations, not that much time is being spent on that "100 lines" versus everything else.

Another issue: Sending fees to miners means miners could take control of the chain at no cost by putting huge fee transactions in their own blocks to control the sidechain.

Skeptical, but remember that they are weighting deeper buried blocks as more, versus PoW where it's just linear.  
However, doesn't this incentivize deeper re-orgs of the Bitcoin blockchain? (and obviously older blocks have less difficulty due to ASIC increases. Something to think about.)

In addition, even if we could get magical pixy dust compression, this doesn't obviate the requirement of validating all the transactions in blocks, which is probably the more important hurdle. So it's definitely not a "free" 2MB, even if magic.

It only affects you if it gets 75%+ miner support, but it's essentially a "larger blocks" BIP which simultaneously allows much more traffic but makes it a larger burden to run a full node.  
That's the tradeoff with block sizes.

You are trusting 51% of miners to be honest, yes.  


Of course not. Miners today are cooperating when it comes to the current consensus ruleset, such as 25 BTC per block in subsidies. They could just as easily decide as a group to stay at 25BTC forever instead of halving. SPV nodes wouldn't know the difference.

Disclaimer/Announcement(?): Core Tech Engineer at Blockstream as of last week.  


Using federated peg, a very similar version to Sidechains [Alpha]( Think multi-sig wallet, and multi-sig blocks.  


You don't want people tampering with the block signers when they are up and running. Further minimizes trust. We would like the worst-case to be the chain halting.  


It certainly has similarities. Federated signers have to sign multi-sig Bitcoin transactions to "cash" people out of their sidechain to Bitcoin proper, and also have to sign blocks to move the sidechain forward. A huge bonus is we can re-use the technology already built for Bitcoin and interoperate in a very straight-forward fashion.  
The technical nitty-gritty will be covered in an upcoming whitepaper, but in short: Sidechains Alpha ++

Payments are going to be ridiculously cheap already, so adding privacy on top is the biggest goal now.
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:17:00
There is no boom. If we hit max blocksize, people will simply ration their use of blockspace. People will switch to off-chain, replace-by-fee to push transactions through, payment channels, etc.  
Bitcoin, as used today with everything on-chain, simply can not fulfill the world's payments needs. Impossible.  
OTOH, look at:   
Using their napkin math even with a 1MB block only, we could service roughly 61M people with unlimited transactions for a year-long channel. 
These types of solutions are a good hint on how to scale without destroying decentralization.

Of the "key" devs literally ~~only~~ Gavin *and Mike Hearn* ~~is~~ are actively talking about it. 
Gavin's not an idiot, but I feel that he's drifted too far off on his own little projects and has little idea what the other devs think anymore.  
The sad part is the smartest guys around, since a lot of them are being paid by Blockstream, are now afraid to speak up publicly about it for fear of seeming hypocritical. The only person really speaking his mind is Peter todd, and he's never had a good relationship with Gavin, so not much constructive happens there.

I just meant "could be" in a technical sense. You can do lower.  


If I give you .1 satoshis in fees, then settle the channel, you don't really get anything. You'll only get it if it gets rounded up to 1 satoshi. 


One big downside is you have to watch the blockchain to make sure your counter-party doesn't try to steal money. In the full version you can actually outsource this task without handing over private keys or anything, which is nice.

They are "verifying", just verifying a different set of rules than you perhaps.  
As a full node you can say "hey, wait a second, this isn't legit!" and switch to the valid(according to their ruleset, not the miners!) chain with most work.

It's the code that runs the network. Everyone runs roughly the same version to make sure consensus isn't broken.

This critique only make sense if you rule out sharing the initial protocol. Which is silly. We can all agree on a protocol apriori then arrive at consensus purely based on PoW.

Once we have OP_CSV we can have that. Malleability fix will enable trustless third parties to broadcast the refund transaction if the counter-party maliciously tries to use an old transaction to steal money. Without that you have to check in every X days, or whatever, depending on channel timeout.

I don't have to prove him wrong. He has to prove himself right. And some really basic napkin math doesn't address any fears of people who are concerned about decentralization of the network.   
Gavin's making his case hard by proposing too much at the same time(multiple scheduled forks based on future advancement?), and confusing a lot of redditors into thinking there is a hardfork scheduled this year or next. He wasn't careful and isn't going out of his way to make sure people understand that that is just his desire, and that it's highly controversial. 
I'll indulge in a small critique of his post: It's interesting to note that his roadmap leaves only room for Americans in the estimates. What about machine to machine payments? What about the rest of the world? These are simply not solved by naive scaling.

Same as today with Bitcoin. Scan a QR code maybe, NFC maybe, then press "send".


Upwards of a few seconds, although optimistic case is much less than a second, since all you are doing is proving to the payee that funds are unlocked to them. No need to propagate this message across the entire Bitcoin p2p network. You only use these messages to settle if either party stops cooperating.


It is represented as the last legitimate transaction in the lightning exchange between you and your channel counter-party, whoever it is. That last transaction will only be broadcast if settlement is required, which hopefully never is. Why close when you are a source of liquidity and can get paid for providing it?


As long as you can reach Starbucks through any node on the lightning network, you can pay them trustlessly, in probably less than a second, without waiting for blocks.

It's an accident of Satoshi using OpenSSL, and also of using the signature when deriving the transaction ID.

around more efficient block relay.  There is a collection of proposals,
some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some
independently invented, called "weak blocks", "thin blocks" or "soft
blocks".  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques
(like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the
transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating
size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this
at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but
fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less
complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a
few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem
in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.  Better understanding
their behavior when miners behave strategically is an open question.
I think a big next step would be along the lines of mempool sync or weak blocks, which would complement the xthin/compact block work already out there. We also don't have any solid data how much these relay improvements are giving quite yet in real life. I'd hope we'd have a follow-up talk on that.
The other throughput win that isn't in this timeline is [Schnorr Signature Aggregation]( which can yield up to 40% improved throughput, incentivizes CoinJoin, and is a softfork.

But you have no idea in what order the transactions were made!!! You are assuming immunity for sybils.  
Repeat this reasoning why we have PoW-based blockchain in the first place until the sun burns out. If you want safer 0-conf either make your trust explicit and use an off-chain bank or use payment channels. 
edit: Note: Garzik's point is about the network *today*, which all software and businesses seem to be assuming safe 0-conf and no way to easily replace transactions. I agree it would be disruptive, but only because of all this naive business models we have today and immature software. I forget the context of what said exactly.

We pay back and forth off-chain, and if you get caught trying to submit an old version of our payments to the block-chain(taking more than I owe you at that moment in time), I take ALL your monies.

Well the current behavior is to reject any chain that is forked a long time ago, valid or not.  
But the purpose is specifically to not let nodes get tricked into following a very long, easy difficulty fork that an already running node would never get tricked into loading.  
Updates like headers-first syncing are slowly making this possibly unneeded over time as nodes can tell much faster which is the best chain. Checkpoints are a hack that eventually will be removed.

Hailing back to Satoshi's predictions doesn't help much, especially after he softforked to 1MB then went away.
@_date: 2015-03-19 15:02:05
But if you have enough mining power you can make a longer chain, stick any transaction you like in it, valid or invalid, and hand it to an SPV client.  
"Hey this output I control has 1M Bitcoin!"  
Currently there is no built in solution to detect this other than out of band phoning a friend, or querying a full node to make sure the chain you're following is legit. People could end up publishing proofs showing that a particular header sequence is fraudulent, but unclear how to best do so.  
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:17:00

Not quite. Soft forks can create lengthy splits in the network.  
Let's say roughly 60% of miners stay behind a softfork upgrade, 40% switch. The old miners will build on the old ruleset, while the upgraded miners will reject the chain, building their own fork.  
Soft-forks: Constraining the validity rule set  
Hard-forks: Relaxing the validity rule set  
To upgraded miners, the old miners are running a "hard-fork"! *hits bong*
@_date: 2017-07-18 12:53:09

I think it'd be a good idea for such an opcode to still allow double-spends where all outputs are same size or larger.

If you don't validate transaction history, you are trusting miners to not make stuff up, like "hey I have $100k!". Perhaps a majority of miners are honest enough. But they might not be honest enough to actually let block subsidy halve, for example.

You'd have to keep the outputs the same, but increase the inputs coming in. It's a pretty complicated UX. Simple replace-by-fee is actually a much cleaner UX as you can just subtract from the change address.

When he says naive, take it in the non-judgemental sense.  
The problem is that as you increase block size, the centralization pressure of both mining and running full nodes goes up. Hard to say exactly what the function is, but it's almost surely non-decreasing. 1GB blocks today, even if we somehow made bitcoind scale up to that, would make it really easy to censor.  
There may be much smarter ways to increase throughput of cryptosystems that are resistant to censorship, or at least don't destroy the censorship resistance of Bitcoin.

Interesting discussion but a couple things bothering me:  
1) Seems sort of cyclical to use the blockchain(through micropayment channels) to price the blocksize. What if the blocks being released are too large for you to run a full node on?  
2) I really don't see the pricing mechanism working out the way he thinks. People are massively incentivized to follow the most recent block. If they aren't paying to see the most recent block they will believe they are behind the "truth". This pricing mechanism seems to open up yet another huge can of incentive worms that will be very hard to analyze. At least a hard cap removes all of this.

Treechains are essentially a sidechain in themself, just a specific structure and mining security model.  
You can think of it as a sidechain with much tighter integration to the main chain, and specific rules about how many chains may be connected to Bitcoin blockchain(2) and how many can be connected to those, etc. Lastly there can not be any SPV in these sub-chains, because miners are not in charge of validation.  
Treechains are pretty complicated and there are un-answered questions about how they should work. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 03:21:33
It can sort of work, if you assume that networks can't be sybiled, etc.  
But if you're assuming that, you don't need blockchains at all.  
The mere fact PoS coins still stand usually means that no one cares enough to attack, or that they're using things like checkpointing to avoid attacks. Bitcoin is by far the largest target.

So the initial syncing part is very quick. Downloads blocks super-crazy.

A good discussion, but you end up with a very similar issue: If BTC price goes "to the moon" then people won't be willing to pay the minimum transaction fee, leading to a hardfork.  
Block reward and hardcoded minimum fees are 100% oblivious of the outside world, and building in some feedback mechanism is probably bad due to miners having control of block inclusion.  
Hard problem.

If you have 21 connections that means you're fine. Bitcoin has pretty low bandwidth/latency requirements.

Ok. I think most of us agree that 1MB is way too small, and unlimited is wrong.  
That leaves a countably infinite series of possible values(assuming we stick to integers!).  
We really need to debate about:  
1) What do we want Bitcoin to do with respect to number of people on planet, transaction frequency, etc?  
2) How hard should it be to run a full node, mine?  
3) What are the triggering events that will precipitate another hard fork to increase it yet again?  
etc  
IMHO, we need to optimize the client, let the 1MB cap hit for a while.  
Then we can decide what a reasonable single-time jump is, if any, based on the tech of that day.

You need full access to the blockchain for the trustless variant of Bitcoin. We call it "full node security". SPV wallets and others give lesser security for massive efficiency speedup.

I see, so you're explicitly warning that old versions have had their security reduced. Is that usually done with softforks? If not, why for this one specifically?

1) The chip holding your secrets aren't general microcontrollers, but [smart cards](

@_date: 2015-03-24 21:04:42
If you never set a max block size(which is what you're suggesting) miners will have incentive to make ever larger blocks. Fees will drop to roughly zero and there will be no security. (and this analysis completely ignores the inherent tradeoffs even before this happens)  
Paper:   
It appears we really do need either a minimum transaction fee or a max block size to not run into this issue.
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:02:24
I've had both, Nano S is clearly superior in my view. Recovery on device directly, smart card security, and form factor alone is enough to put it over the top.

"Double-spends" on that website can be triggered by [Transaction Malleability]( but really have nothing to do with the final result of a transaction. You may have sent the transaction with too-little fee though.

Does it run spv in browser? 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:22:11
Oh I agree we can do better.  
I think block reward + fees shouldn't be spendable for a week or two. (144 * {7,14} blocks) 
This would also insulate us from wild price downward swings, where miners will just shut off their miners, extending block times, which leads to essentially DoS, downward spiral. (this only happens in cases of large block reward naturally)  
Smoothing out mining will be a really interesting problem to model as the block reward goes down.

In a naive PoS model someone who owned a lot of stake in the past can go back and completely re-write history for almost no cost(aside from computing the history itself).  
Lots of newer PoS try to side-step this by adding lots of complexity, but underlying there is a hole that PoW specifically fills.

The Bitcoin security model doesn't depend on persistent identities, so it's unlikely people are making a ton of fakes nodes.  
If we incentivized nodes, just watch it go up 20x-100x. And we aren't starving for bandwidth even today.

Ledger Wallet uses smart cards. Kind of close. (and there's no reason data can't be encrypted using the safe private keys, no?)

The analogy is still wrong.  
If everyone ran bitcoin-ruby I'd probably say you should run that. 100% agreement on the state of the ledger is the "safety" of the "plane".  
It just so happens Satoshi pooped out some code in C++, without a clear consensus library split. We have to work on that first. Once the code is isolated much better analysis can be done, and people can simply build on top using whatever they like.

I don't think 1MB is the correct size, but running a full node is trivial *today* and would only get even more trivial.

It's not a confirmation. They are using an extremely convoluted "enhancement" of GA.it's instant transactions.  
But it certainly isn't included in any blocks, even if you believe the masternodes aren't lying.

No. The merge-mined version is a soft-fork, but there are no current plans to roll out the necessary soft-fork. For now the federated sidechains, which needs no fork, will be rolled out for testing and evaluation.

CoinShuffle, when done right, will find plenty of participants for free. My guess is people who want a transaction quickly will cover more of the cost of the transaction fee for those who are ok waiting for slow mixes.

Potentially.  
As long as people understand you're not getting the same guarantees you're getting in Bitcoin proper(when running a full node!) it could be useful.  
If nothing else you could send your coin to a Zerocash chain, then send them back.

The origin of the 1MB limit isn't particularly noteworthy when debating what we should do now.  
An infinite blocksize, game theoretically, as far as we can tell, would lead to all transactions being added to blocks as long as they include a fee large enough to pay for the block orphan risk, and the actual cost of processing the transaction. This is ~0, if propagation is O(1).  
Worse, the fees you're paying isn't really going towards hashing at all, since they are just cost recovery for latency/electricity. We need hashing power, right?  
There are two ways to fund the network: limited blockspace, auctioning that space off, or a mandatory fee. A mandatory fee could be implemented by a cartel of miners. Another way to look at it is a soft-fork.  
So the trick is:  
We need to be able to price blockspace size or fees such that the network is secure. It's hard!

I think he kind of mis-states this.  
From 0.11 on it'll be totally normal to run a pruned node, but as a node if you want trustlessness you have to sync from the beginning. Otherwise you'll have to do something like grab the UTXO set from a trusted source, then grab the most recent blocks.

I'm assuming mining hardware is nearly commodified(very low capital costs, almost all money is spent on burning electricity), and miners are impossible to "catch" IRL. These attackers wouldn't be interested in extending the longer "true" chain, for whatever reason. It's actually pretty bad news that miners can be caught and convicted, because that means they are subject to state coercion.   
OTOH if my scenario is true, it opens up the door for people to mine a tiny bit at a loss, at home, like you say.

Let's pretend you aren't trolling...  
1) Sharing the private key won't help if the person can send a double-spend that gets mined anyways. You can counter-sign with even higher fee, but so can they in return.  
2) If you receive any further payments to an address that is controlled by said private key, they can steal your money.  
3) If you are using an HD wallet, if someone gets a hold of your Master Public Key in addition to that private key you handed over, you can get completely robbed since they can generate your entire keychain. (aside from hardened keys I believe)  
4) Probably more reasons if anyone wants to chime in.

No no no. It was super broken in many ways. For example, somenoe was able to give himself a few billion BTC automatically. It was very easy to DoS. It's a lot better now. Most of the big work being done is finding these weaknesses and removing them.  
For example, the checkpoints currently in Bitcoin are a hack to stop a potential DoS attack against syncing nodes. Hopefully these can be removed after a couple more updates.

Depends on what they're saying.  
It stops certain attacks, and not others.  
For example, it can't detect addresses you're trying to send to being swapped on the computer. Malware could always attack that way to steal funds. For that you should get out of band confirmation of addresses.  
Another is that the Trezor won't resist sophisticated physical attacks, which is why it's recommended you use the passphrase on top. The Ledger line of products are more robust against these due to the use of smart cards.  
Otherwise I think it's ok.  
FWIW if you're looking for a device I'd just order a Ledger Nano S which is like the Trezor in that it has a screen for confirmation, but also based on smart cards.

I'd have to think it through. On the same spectrum people have thought about making larger blocks harder to find(more difficult).  
Issue with that may be headers-first can't be verified without looking at the actual blocksize. (among I'm sure a million other issues)  
edit: One huge issue with your scheme, and any inherent BTC pricing scheme is that it is invariant to the "worth" of BTC vs other goods. If BTC goes $1K+, suddenly fees go way up for larger blocks, and vice-versa for small. It's a very similar issue to using a block reward indefinitely; it gets no outside pricing signals.  
With the difficulty thing, at least we can use the current difficulty as a signal for how much extra hashing costs. hmmmm

You as a user may specify a max mempool size.  
Once your mempool hits that size, it starts tossing the cheapest transactions. The transactions that get tossed now set the minimum fee to get into the mempool + a little more. This minimum fee decays exponentially when blocks are found.
There's more sauce than that, but that's the major parts.

Oh ok. I know Luke is a stickler for "proper" word choices(stale not orphan!!!) :P wasn't sure how tx fees mature


AFAIK private mining outfits up until now were mining at pretty decent profits, due to the non-commodity nature of ASICs the past years and huge price upswings. Not a serious issue until that changes, and maybe never would be.

He gets a little hot under the collar when people say the wallet has never improved, or is the worst or something. For example, it was one of the first wallets to support fee estimation.
The rest is just lack of review for the new updates. People are focused on node stuff, segwit, p2p relay, etc. Only a few people give the wallet love, and it shows.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:02:19
Good, well-argued article, but your conclusion is clearly not proven.  
Long-term PoW doesn't make much sense to me *except* as an altruistic(or more accurately mining-at-a-small-loss) publishing platform. If people are mining at cost or better, chain re-writes make sense for an attacker, assuming ASICs have become pure commodities.  
Society runs almost entirely on altruism(you call cops if someone is murdering a stranger in front of you, right?); no reason why this can't extend to Bitcoin.  
A million people donating $1 a day in hashing is enough to fund the network to roughly what we get today. That(or some configuration of people/corporations/and $) is *not* impossible.  
That's my optimistic vision, anyways.  
edit: Well if we're going really optimistic, something like treechains pans out, and individual people will just publish their own data X levels down, leading to a healthy amount of mining non-altruistically. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:46:08

It could be permanent.  
A cartel of greedy miners could forever continue their fork, tricking rubes like you into thinking they have lots of money by essentially inflating the currency.  
There's a real worry that as the system scales up, not enough people will run a full node, allowing the powerful to "print money". Running a full node completely inoculates you from this attack.

Checklocktimeverify(or something similar) can get around this.  
You're right though there's a small window when their servers could disappear right after you made a transaction and you're hosed. I suppose there could be a version where your application won't sign until it is sent the pre-signed transaction for the next address? Seems complicated though and requires out of band channels to your device. (and malleability fucks this up too)

The tension is unmistakable.  
I'm somewhere in the middle. I think we have a large space of values we could increase to without damaging infrastructure, and over time that will continue to grow. Rather than requiring an "enthusiast" computer/connection, make it a "budget" much like today.(allow me to ignore the political and consensus nightmare for sake of argument)

If you're not too worried something like Armory makes sense. It's a full-node, so you get the best network security(can't be tricked into thinking you have something you don't), at the risk of running on general purpose hardware. You'll learn more about the protocol I think by running a real node.  
If you want more security(from pc standpoint) go with a multi-signature wallet like GreenAddress.it.  
Or get a Ledger Wallet, but that's like $50 after shipping.

Note how the agreement was made without doing very basic testing, like "can we get a testnet up and running and benchmark block propagation over modern p2p arch?" A number was picked out of thin air and agreed to by them and they have no technical justification for it. In fact, a number of them like Peter at blockchain seem unaware that 8MB is the worst case, and keep talking about "2MB".
Add this to the fact that their chief engineer is someone who frankly didn't even understand Segwit until he tried to HF it, that should have people hitting the pause button for now.


I'd rather split than do a HF for HF sake. That said, it seems more logical to do a max weight growth formula instead, allowing us to see the effects on the network more slowly.

Except recall that paper wallets require proper software as well. And they can be quite dangerous to spend from. And encourage address reuse. For a few dollars you can get a  which is strictly superior.


A proper airgapped offline computer is one of the best ways, yes. But you need to make sure it stays offline and clean.
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:58:29


It's not a "brain wallet" exactly because a device is generating proper entropy but I get what you mean.  
The issue is that if you don't do it this way, the only other way is to store you wallet on our servers encrypted with a password you choose. That's... dubious security. 
As a fall-back on GreenAddress you can set a PIN so at least per device you don't have to enter it again. Or you can use Ledger/Trezor to log in. Maybe we can brainstorm other ideas as well?  


For now Lawrence likes nLockTime the best because it gives you the highest privacy on-chain, and not too much hassle. OP_CLTV was ok, but then refreshing UTXOs would happen randomly and fingerprint easily. OP_CSV is more flexible, but still would be very identifying on-chain.  
With MAST we could hide the OP_CSV logic, and only show 2-of-2 spend(possibly even 1-of-1 with Schnorr multisig!). Maximal privacy and very easy to use. That's our ultimate plan.


We will obviously support it when safe to do so with real money. Right now the Lightning Guys are hard at work making sure the protocol is designed to protect privacy, and scale with users.

I don't think they're going to get rich at all. By definition the system will be an open standard, so people will immediately fork, place their computation in safe locations around the globe, and link up hubs.

It was removed by consensus, because obviously people didn't sign up for such a system.  
Consensus is really hard. When alts go around "innovating" at the speed of light, you'll notice they do very little to remove weaknesses until they completely break the system(and often add features that are completely un-reviewed, or even closed source!). Bitcoin core devs are much more concerned with making sure things will keep ticking along even in the presence of attackers.  
Core devs are hoping to make it much more robust in the future by moving all consensus stuff into a VM that gives provable properties, and freezing softforks using some technical means. This would make it 100x safer than it is today.

I can't speak to business models, but the signing as service model is completely open and open to competition. In fact, BitGo has BitGo Instant, which is a distant nephew of the service(they do 2 of 3 with 3rd in trusted storage of some sort IIRC).  
Yes, if you're asking someone to sign something non-blindly, you will reveal information to that third party. Such is life. If you can't trust anyone, run Core wallet!

No. If you leak a private key though, the attacker can re-derive the master private key.

People really should stop assuming you'll pass around your MPK.  
It's much safer to just generate 10,000 keys and pass them over. They're tiny and don't risk complete compromise in case of one private key being leaked. Agreeing on a sequence is the 'key'.
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:27:25
Other explanation isn't that great.
Measuring against speed of light simply allows us to understand how much more it's possible to improve, for on-earth mining at least.  
When a new block is found, it's best if all other miners know about it, to allow less work to be wasted, and allowing smaller miners to stay profitable. This helps mining resist centralization pressures like trustfully mining on top of others' blocks, or simply joining the largest pool to increase profits.

um, no. You set up payment challens with hubs, and payments get passed around on a circuit of sorts for trustless payments that eventually get settled on the blockchain.

Ok. Many of these schemes like Coinfeine(sp?) have questionable assumptions on how people will work game theoretically or require a huge amount of up front capital to make sure people don't run away with money, collude with signers, whatever.  
Like, let's say it's just us two. We both lock 1BTC in a 2-of-2. We then trade 1BTC for $200. But I fail to send the full amount and say "just send me .7BTC of the locked deposit and I'll send the rest of our agreed amount".

The Core implementation only does hardened derivation, meaning you can not export an master xpub to generate all the addresses. In the future you may be given a choice, but for now it's the safer route. (non-hardened private parent keys can get cracked if xpub + 1 child private key are leaked)

"The re-assembled coin bore only a tiny mark at the edge of the foil where the needle was first inserted, a mark which could be easily mistaken for slight wear and tear, perhaps from being carried in a pocket with other coins. Stits indicated that with practice even this small mark could be avoided and suggested that next time he’d like to try submerging or fuming the coin in the solvent and simply allowing the foil to fall off without a scratch."
It was serious enough that the coin maker is in contact with them now trying to figure out how to make a new product that isn't so vulnerable.

Oh, then it's not the same. I think for any attack to work, the benefits have to be up front(I think the paper claims this) unless the miners believe a 51% attack, once discovered, would not immediately crash Bitcoin. Which it of course would, as we're back to centralized banking.  
I'll take a look at the alternatives, thanks! One problem with these altcoins is that unless we see smoke, no one will ever believe there is a fire. Unless enough people are concerned, these will never take off in development.

The code has been reviewed a million times, by white/black hat hackers and developers of all stripes.  
The biggest worry would be when Satoshi returns to cash in some of his ~1M Bitcoins. That will send panic through the markets, but by then I'm guessing we'll be nearer to the 21Million mint mark, and that will only account for 1/21 all BTC, so the rational price drop should be quite small.

Further: I think rich people will simply have a ton of hashing power sitting around, ready to go. It won't be profitable, but honestly, ASIC hardware should be dirt cheap(simple circuits), and they will run at a short-term loss in order to keep the difficulty stable.  
Of all the technical problems, shifts in difficulty by malicious actors isn't one of them that keeps me up at night. I'm much more worried about the decoupling between the security of the network and the mining profitability.

You are asking how it could force people to not do evil. We are just pointing out that it can do as lot more than traditional systems. That you don't like those solutions is a different issue.  
For escrow, a fraudster would have to know they are never getting your money and still go through with it. It doesn't give them any incentive to defraud you, other than to burn your money. Most people defraud for financial benefit.  
If you want a third party, you can hire a trusted third party instead of counting on a random PayPal employee.  Hell, I could see a reddit group who do escrow arbitration for a tiny fee or free. Lastly, the third party couldn't ever steal the money themselves! PayPal steals money all the time!

If the miner is already accepting double-spends for greedy reasons, he'll switch to 1a-&gt;1b-&gt;1d, and the double-spender has no way of stopping this, unless he gets lucky and the selfish miner pool finds a block before they get 1b-&gt;1d.

Mining will relocate to:  
1) Industrial mining  
2) Places where electricity is free/near free.  
  
3) Miners as water/space heaters. Almost all electricity in mining ends up being heat waste in the end, so use it and then mining won't "cost" anything, outside of internet connection.  
This of course won't fix the centralization encouraged by the PoW scheme, but at least having many miners that can change pools at a whim will be helpful.

With multisig you don't have to bring together the pieces to make a valid transaction. Just pass the transaction from device to device, signing until it's ready. SSSS requires all the pieces end up on a single device for computation of private key.

Over time I've sort of softened up to Litecoin, only in that it makes a great insurance policy against a govt spinning up a bunch of ASICs to take over the network.

I'm talking about the "unsafe" version, as I think miners will end up just taking the higher-fee one, if acting selfishly(arguably rational).  
If we do replace by fee, a merchant could detect a double-spend, and "burn" all the money by sending a transaction with 100% miner fee. I think that'd be enough to stop most double-spend attempts from keeping their money, and would reduce the incentive massively.  
edit: The more I think about it, the fee-guessing algorithm could be orthogonal to replace-by-fee. We should probably have a way of guessing a good first bid, then be able to up it as needed to get it through.

You don't have to peg your price in BTC. No idea why you think this is a good idea. If production costs + reasonable margin is *really* $200, say so.   
If anything you are making people hold their BTC until a competitor comes around and makes you slash your prices back down to something more reasonable. Apparently you thought ~$100 was a good idea before, so many are going to wait until it hits that.  
That said, I wish you guys all the best. Physical wallets are a huge step forward for Bitcoin acceptance as a currency. If you offered a half-off deal(or made it easy to pair up with someone to buy 2) you might have a pre-order.

Escrow. You send the money initially, but unless you sign off again, the seller gets nothing. You can't get your money back, but they won't get it through fraud either.  
Or you could introduce a third party that is trusted in the judgement.

Copy and pasted part of it:  
*However I seriously doubt the TL;DR scenario. People buy computers, even though they get better within 6 months. People will buy the newest iPhone, every year. People buy cars, even though they instantly devalue rolling off the lot. People make their own decisions about immediate reward versus future reward. People in the US would save more than they do now(and that's good!), but it won't be a scenario where no one is buying things they want. People will expect deflation, and use that in their calculus of short vs long term needs.*

I'm supposing there *is* a market in the future of course, with exchanges in the local currency.
Those are some hurdles, but the end-game I thought would still be considered remittance, as sending bitcoins is sending money... just no need to convert later, or pay 1% to convert to fiat(like I do in the US).

"If someone else has created those keys, doesn't it mean they know / have copies of both the public and private keys?"  
Yes. That's why most paper wallet software runs off-line, so you can save the source, boot into a safe OS, and run it there. The only real risk is something like random numbers not being generated with enough entropy. bitaddress.org is the most common. If you're even more paranoid, dl the source from github.

The "busy-work" part is the part that spaces out the mining successes. It doesn't ensure security other than preventing forks. Which is still valuable of course.

I don't hold LTC because I think it brings nothing to the table. Scrypt already has an ASIC(or will soon enough) and 3-minute block time doesn't appear to much advantage in real world use cases. There is no reason to think it will be longer term a better investment/gamble than BTC.  
On the other hand, it's your money, and there's probably room for another cryptocurrency. I also guess being the 2nd most developed coin is something that gives value. But I plan on taking home the prom queen, not 2nd place.

If you're honestly interested, take a look at Trezor. The device is single-use, open source, and never lets private keys leave the device. That coupled with the payment protocol will allow people to have SSL-certified payment addresses, so you can send money to anyone safely *even on an infected computer*.  
Mobile devices are ironically much safer than desktop computers, but they're still not safe enough. I'm pretty excited to see where these hardware wallets(and their descendants) end up.

Coinbase is more like a bank account, in that one doesn't control their private keys. Coinbase simply credits you with bitcoin, then when you click "send" they find bitcoin lying around and send it(not accusing them of fractional banking but they have 1:1 storage like this). Any other wallet instantly sends the transactions to the network, as there is no guess work in grabbing keys. Transaction reach a majority of the network in under 30 seconds easily. 
As far as telling the difference? Education I guess. Coinbase wants to call them self a wallet, I don't really think they are.

It would certainly make it easier accidentally, and even easier on purpose. And this is before merchants have built-in defenses to it, which will happen. I think in the short term double-spending with higher txn fees to the *same* recipient address will come first in wallets.  
Zero-trust isn't actually true. We're just not trusting any one institution, and hoping to build incentives to put our transactions through unmolested.

That is true. Unless you pay a 3.5% premium to use a credit card. I can wait a week since I'm not day trading currency.

I think Taxis would be a great way to use the micropayment channel in Bitcoin. As you're driving, tiny payments are being negotiated on work done. That way it would be both transparent "negotiating" and they couldn't walk away without paying at all.

lol, you're clearly not getting Bitcoin's security model.  
Using identities that are easily spoofed by nation state actors is a *bad idea*.  
Bitcoin has no (persistent) identities. We don't want to incentivize attackers.
@_date: 2015-02-09 14:06:35
Miners appear to not have a high orphan rate regardless of block size, at least the well-connected ones.  
Therefore, barring any other issues, they appear to be altruistically packing blocks(if the transaction has the "standard" fee).  
Some day they may be more "greedy" but they aren't yet.

Why is the txn being blocked? there's no reason a client couldn't send the money again, even though current clients don't do this to avoid double-spends. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:18:36
From the thread it looks like only new-ish posters are posting issues, and a random address doesn't really convince outsiders unless there's more.

For Coinbase, I'd recommend getting white-listed a priori. After that, buys/sells are easy and consistent.

I'm not an investor, so I'm not really sure the real definition of "risk" is, but as long as you aren't living paycheck to paycheck, putting a little bit in BTC is not a bad idea at all. Taking 1BTC now, barring breakdown of BTC, will reap medium-to-great rewards. $200 is a drop in the bucket if you live in America. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:00:48

Whatever that plan is you're likely going to have to convince the Status Quo types, unless it's something really good I'm willing to split over. The network effect is important, and the "crazies" are important, just like Coinbase is important.
Now if segwit2x folks thinks "2MB" is worth it to threaten splitting consensus 3 months after code is written, they've certainly lost me! I'm willing to help out once segwit activates to make sure they have the highest chance of succeeding. They might not like my advice though :P

I'm speaking theoretically. Bitcoin still isn't a sure thing at all. I'm thinking future-wise. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:12:34
In the future all transactions will probably require a fee, and will be set by supply of miners and the demand of people wanting space on the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-10-24 13:25:44
I'll be interested to hear this. After much reading I have come to at least think of replacement as the "best yet", and it also introduces a great way to reduce the effectiveness of 0-conf double-spend attacks.  
Also it seems inevitable that people will want to speed up a transaction if it's taking longer than usual, and for miners to act in their own self-interest for maximal fees.  
Impress me gavin!

Sorry this post is becoming a dump for my findings on discussions of these types of attacks.     
I don't know how well loyalty programs would work in the end game once the margins get extremely thin(and people stop pre-ordering ASICs). I don't think people will mine up-front for loss of money(unless there is some sort of Ponzi scheme, which is not sustainable). edit3: Oh, do you mean bribes from double-spends?
I disagree that this paper is wankery. Just because you wrote about a different flavor first. It's yet another chink in the PoW armor, even if I'm right about loyalty programs not really having legs in the end game of mining.
 
Good point though. In the end I think a 51% attack is a remote possibility, as if it's considered dangerous now, I don't think it will get any more accepted.  
edit: What kind of hard fork fix would you want? Dumping of PoW seems extremely unlikely at this point, since miners run the show. (maybe I'll drop a couple coin in PPCoin heh)

I think Gyft -&gt; Amazon is by far the easiest route for now.  
They offer via scaling and a bit of BTC savings. They sell tons of cards, and store some BTC which appreciates.  
for me, my credit card offers 5% cash back for the next two months on Amazon, so it doesn't make sense for me to use my Bitcoin yet.

Agreed on the former. No idea on the latter.  
I'd be extremely surprised if any large company adopted it as a payment method at least for another year.  
OTOH, Starbucks usually only gets $2-3 per credit card swipe, much of which is eaten up by fees. Bitcoin really does make sense for this particular merchant in the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:32:42
I don't think any particular projection is impossible, eventually. But just trying to imagine who *wouldn't* cash out if it went to $600k in a year!?? Store of value can drop to zero at any time if some technical problem pops up.   
Hell, I love Bitcoin, but I'd cash out as fast as I could! I'd keep some in obviously, but I'd be buying a nice house, diversifying in stocks, etc. I'd be retired before 30!
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:47:29

A double-spender would have to somehow double-spend within a few second window without the merchant seeing. Future Bitcoin clients will almost instantly spot this, as they will re-broadcast these messages to everyone they know.

For smaller purchases, 0-conf is just fine(plenty of ways of mitigating/punishing double-spenders). If you're buying a lot of stuff, you might have to go the card route, or wait a few minutes.

It's the same problem as in chains. How do we know someone isn't spending the transaction in two forks?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:45:58
It's an issue with hardcoded transaction fees and miners not changing their values that they accept. That'll get fixed soon, I hope. It's nothing fundamental.

edit: I'm speaking of why one would pick a particular coin for actual holdings etc, not saying diversity itself is bad. Diversity may indeed save cryptocurrency if BTC's developers somehow explode the ecosystem.    
I'm an alt-coin pessimist. The only Altcoin that makes any sense to me is PPCoin, as it's using Proof-of-Stake, not Proof-of-Work. It would be really hard for BTC to change at this point, and if centralization becomes too bad for the safety of the network(I don't think it will) PoS will probably be the next attempt.  
LTC promises more security with 3-minute confirmations, but really unless you are doing high-ticket items, 0-conf will be the norm for face to face transactions(and who the heck will wait for 3 minutes versus 10 at McDs?). There are many ways to mitigate double-spend attacks(which have been discussed many times before, ask if you want me to reiterate). To me, it's like a successor to TCP/IP: not a big enough advantage to advocate it.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:29:42
All this hyper-ventilating is way off-point.  
People are going to "red-list" coins, regardless of what people think. As long as these red-lists are run by community in a distributed way, and not integrated into the protocol, I think the "honey badger" of money will do just fine.

When I started looking around the crypto-currency community, I found Litecoin, and was like "oh cool!"  
I went to their forums. Literally most of the people there only cared that they could still GPU mine at the time. That was literally their reason for supporting the currency over Bitcoin. "ASICs are evil!". Well buddies, ASICs are coming for Litecoin. 5 minutes of googling would show that most of the benefits are superficial over Bitcoin.   
I can't wait until the crypto-currency community isn't dominated by high school students looking to make a quick buck. Meanwhile, I've parked my money in Bitcoin, and will wait for the next wave of currencies to pop up.

Slight rebuttal: Any large govt could build their own factory to make ASICs and take over the network, pretty much for the next few years. It'd be pretty obvious what was happening, but no one would be able to stop it.  
Longer-term: Once the ASIC market shrinks to 2-3 makers total, since fabrication plants become stupid-capital intensive as you get smaller, the NSA could force a backdoor that allows them to control the network.  
Just some paranoia for thought.

This paper makes me think of BitTyrant, the abusive bittorrent protocol.

Still, it's a really bad idea to have incorrect incentives in a system, and I think the 25% cap is a good one to follow, exploit or not.

"People are confused. They think because it's called cryptocurrency it's a currency. I don't think it is a currency. It's a store of value, a distributed ledger. It's a great place to put assets, especially in places like Argentina with 40 percent inflation, where $1 today is worth 60 cents in a year, and a government's currency does not hold value. It's also a good investment vehicle if you have an appetite for risk. But it won't be a currency until volatility slows down. Whenever the regulatory framework is clearer, and the volatility comes down, then we'll consider it."  
Key quotes. Bitcoin is in a real chicken-egg problem. People won't adopt unless there's less volatility. It won't be less volatile unless people use it.

It's not a well-explained argument, but it is certainly one. We live in a reality of bad vs worse. I wish we could do a carbon-free decentralized payment network that encourages saving rather than debt-spending, but for now Bitcoin is the best bet at achieving many of the goals.

If the mining pools are quasi-centralized(less than ~10 mining pools making up 95%+) then I'd basically agree. That is the case today(I think), but maybe not in the future.  
But maybe it'll be less centralized, and I don't like assuming people will go against their short-term gain for a small chance that they ruin in the network. It would be like gambling with good odds, unless too many people start to do it.

It's a valid criticism. Cozying up to the regulators means things like ZeroCoin will have less and less chance of being adopted, outside a fork. The US govt will throw a temper tantrum anytime Bitcoin moves in a more privacy-preserving direction.  
That said, Bitcoin does indeed need a "nice public" face to help adoption take off. Once the genie is out of the bottle, it's game over for regulators. Go ahead, enforce the impossible.  
And if privacy can't be achieved(I think it can via CoinJoin etc but let's pretend) a fork is always possible.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:03:12
It makes it clear that bitcoins are divisible in some manner. Many people don't know this. And even if they do, arbitrary amounts of money for arbitrary amounts of bitcoin can still come off as "expensive". My wife who's a math/econ degree holder still got tripped up on this, even though she understands it's arbitrary.  
I think there is something to be said with that we only can really hold three numbers in our head at a time. Anything larger looks "really large".

People don't understand BTC or QE.
They understand(or at least think) they can easily get cash, and that they can stick it in a bank and forget about it because it's insured and that it won't lose half its value in a month.
At least a couple of these need to be fixed before BTC gains wide acceptance. BTC "banks" with insurance are the next big thing needed.

I don't understand why we can't slowly grow the blocksize. Bump it when needed, and debate along the way. I'm a little afraid Gavin just wants to do away with the limit, and no productive debate will happen until a crisis hits.  
Maybe that will be Bitcoin's "partial shutdown", where we just hit the blocksize limit for a while, then eventually come to an agreement to end the "sequester".

That leaves the other two possibilities. I think there's plenty of room for a number of "small" cryptocurrencies that only geeks/black market users use.

*Transactions* are irreversible, not payments. Bitcoin has built-in n-of-m signatures needed, so you can build in escrow. You can't renege on your agreement, but you can have an arbiter weigh in on whether the buyer/seller acted fairly *if you want*. It's all choice.

It of course won't be zero in the long-run, but it probably won't be 2.8% either, since once the block rewards are gone, people will pay as much as they're willing to get on the blockchain.

$37k is the mildly successful scenario.
@_date: 2013-09-28 15:52:45
Well, if these were fixed, BTC would already be mainstream.
1 is practically fixed, and will only be more so in the future.  
2 is fine, assuming it's mainstream, it's a one-click procedure  
3 This will have to be fixed via better infrustructure. Most people will simply use an insured deposit location like coinbase(they want to be insured) I'm guessing. Only cost is buying and selling BTC for USD. People and passwords/backups make for retards.  
4 This should also be much easier with more basic infrustructure  
5 Chicken and egg problem! This will come bit by bit as infrastructure improves.  
  
My point being none of these things are insurmountable. It's obvious why all cash use isn't replaced with BTC *now*, but it's not crazy to think it couldn't mostly be replaced. The article is just saying there is a *lot* of room for growth.

For block size limit, miners would simply have to allow bigger block sizes. This is currently hardcoded in bitcoind.
For the off-chain stuff: Not an expert, sorry. It's not changing the protocol, just working outside the blockchain until a sufficient amount of transactions have been clumped together. People like Peter Todd are advocates of the strategy.

I think it's a bad idea to put more money into BTC than you are ok losing. That's a valid strategy. But if nothing about BTC has changed, and you don't need the money immediately(and don't have a growth strategy for your money other than bank interest), I think a longer-term view is needed.

I agree that it doesn't succeed as a currency *today*, but:  
1) You can not tell me it won't be in 10 years once the market is far more mature. You may doubt it, but certainty is hard.  
2) It still functions as a payment network, and isn't going away, barring a technical glitch that takes it all down somehow.  
3) It also functions as a public ledger for anything else people want to use it for.  
Maybe it will never turn out to be a currency. That's only one function of many.

Why is it funny trying to find flaws? You might disagree with them, but it doesn't mean conclusions they find can't be true.  
There are many huge hurdles Bitcoin will face. The deadly ones are the technical.  
Read the entire article, and then read the comments section. Cunicula and the author are worried that as the mining rewards approach zero, the dominant strategy may be a 51% stake, with some double-spending to subsidize the dominance. The author suggests that maybe a set block reward would be better, instead of going to zero. Proof-of-stake schemes often do something similar as well.  
Bitcoin, as it currently exists, is not the end. Just the beginning. I'm guessing Satoshi themselves didn't know it was actually going to take off like this. They could not have predicted 10+ years into the future.

Interesting, but seems like it would have tons of side-effects. Seems like a perfect thing to test in an altcoin. More thoughts on this later. 
One thing I like about this is that it puts more pressure on the miner to invest in hashes and not just general computing infrastructure.

Practically I think these red-lists will only "work" in the extreme cases, making it harder to initially off-load well-known stolen coins. It will probably make stealing Bitcoins slightly less profitable(or just slower to offload), but they'll eventually work their way back into circulation and forgotten.

Micropayments are the foot in the door for BTC. Perfect platform!
@_date: 2013-11-21 03:05:28
Nope, it's a pretty cool trick, right? It would basically make double-spending a very low probability steal, and the person would be at risk of arrest for no gain.  
Other tricks could be just to have merchants overcharge a bit, then refund once the  transaction gets one confirmation, since refunds are essentially free.

I still don't see a use case for it over BTC. I'm not saying it's "bad", I'm saying the marginal utility approaches zero. (as a science experiment for slightly changed things, and maybe showing what's possible, it's fine, but it doesn't really fix any of BTC's problems)

In this case yes, but not necessarily otherwise. Off-chain transactions can and will be a huge part of Bitcoin, especially as mining reward drops and transaction fees start to rise.

That's the thing. That's not an argument for a particular altcoin, just altcoins in general(not arguing with you, just reiterating my point elsewhere). That's why I'm just sitting back and letting people play around with altcoins, while I stay in BTC land for now. If there is a clear winner, and people actually end up using the 2nd coin for a real purpose other than mixing, I guess I'll just shrug and do as the Romans do.

1) Transactions propagate to the network in less than 10 seconds. Miners for now pick that one and stick with it.  
2)Supposing that's not enough, and some script-kiddy sends the same amount to a different address right after with a higher miner fee, AND gets the miner to accept it(doubtful, as this behavior will be spotted and discouraged), the merchant can have a service that immediately forwards the original transaction money to a random address, with 100% miner's fee. They call this "scorched earth" strategy.  
For something less than $1000 in person, I'd be really surprised that the person mounted a double-spend attack 4 layers deep in the chain...

Anecdote != data.  
You need to buy Bitcoin multiple times, then test to see if the rise/fall in price is correlated with getting cancelled. Of course there will be more cancellations with more sales: YOU'RE DRAWING MORE SAMPLES  
Thinking more about it, it's going to be difficult to do. Best I can think of is make a new account, and start making small purchases. There is a time variance in the samples of course, so we're banking on their anti-fraud measures not changing much based on temporal effects.

Regardless, there is no inherent roadblock to ASICs for Scrypt. Only wishful thinking and a slight lag.  
In fact, in the end game, *mining LTC will probably be more wasteful* as it needs more memory etc. Or it might just reach equilibrium at a less amount of hashpower, which isn't any safer. Any Proof-of-Work system will live and die the same way in the end.

The miner's fee is for confirmations, which means an average of 10 minute wait. I'm not sure what "bter" is, or what they're waiting for, as the network is alerted to your payment within seconds usually.

You do realize the price of Bitcoin has gone up from ~100 to ~500 in 2 months, right? If miners are accepting your transaction fees, it means it's enough.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:47:14
Of course. There is no "solution" to all problems.  
I see two futures:   
1) Small blocksize, higher fees. Lots of miner/pool diversity. Most people use off-chain transactions for payments. On-chain is for legal purposes of stating ownership/signing contracts.  
2) Uncapped/Large blocksize, very small fees. A couple dozen large mining pools, ASICs spread around the globe being used as heating devices.
  
There is plenty of room in between, but that's where I see the Gavin/Peter battle taking place.

Every transaction sends ALL of the money somewhere. You need to have a "change address" to send the rest to.  
IMO, simply sweep the entire wallet using modern wallet software, then send the rest to a new paper wallet if you're being safe with the rest.

"Voice" vs "Exit". I think over time, maybe, the situation will improve via voice. Some places will get worse thanks to terrible govt policies(Argentina).

While I'm *extremely* optimistic about long-term growth(I bought in recently, right before Silk Road went down), Bitcoin is not nearly useful enough *today* for a $1k evaluation, much less $200.  
Bitcoin is in a dangerous, dangerous time in it's life. Serious enough that people are looking, but not serious enough that there are solutions normal people can use without getting hacked/lose their money. I wish we could move 5 years into the future instantly, sidestep the ASIC arms race, lack of physical wallets, etc.

There have been plenty of details responses already. The attack, while theoretically real(we think), is pretty impractical unless you can stop people from sending messages to legit miners. Which is already very hard.  
There have also been proposals for pretty interesting fixes. My favorite so far is a method to punish miners for instigating forks.

I'm interesting in parking a small amount of money in BTC for long term high risk high reward investment, but I really don't want to screw up and somehow expose myself to getting the money piflered. I think I'm just going to use Coinbase, at least initially, and if they get insured like a real bank just keep it there.

Small retailers have it much worse off than that(up to 4%). But it's a good point.

Let's pretend that BTC doesn't have bubbles every other week.  
It still would make more sense for someone to just pay using fiat if you're not given a discount. You'd be paying 1% more to convert to BTC. People should be paying 3.5% less or MORE if we're avoiding credit card fees! That's when real adoption would occur.

If you aren't using BIP0038 to encrypt the wallet, you can simply import the key using any software. The string is the private key. If you need BIP0038 decoder, Mycelium and others do it now.

I think a middle-ground is most likely, tbo. If it's useful to tech geeks, and drug buyers, but never catches on to the public. Current price is based heavily on speculation, and I think the market will probably catch up to the speculation. Not sure what will happen after.

1) Yep, although I'm not sure if they're implemented. I think BitcoinJ has an on-chain micro-payment channel, which could be used as well.  
2) If you uncap it, it may encourage more centralization of mining. I'm not so worried about this, because it's centralizing regardless of what we do.

I'd sort of disagree though that if magically we had water heaters that would be "centralized". Large pools are here to stay, unfortunately. At least water heaters would allow millions of people to move from pool to pool, and start new pools when needed. Huge datacenters would not allow this as much.

I like this solution, other than it might teach the receiver of the wallet a bad lesson in safety. The user should *always* immediately sweep the wallet or assume the money will be stolen.

But if a sizeable number of miners agree to this, game theoretically, the other miners will follow suit and conform to avoid serious forks. It's another level of voting inside the protocol.  
Not that I totally buy the argument, but there we go.
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:31:20
  
Excerpt: "However we can make zero-confirmation transactions safe without complex trusted identity systems, ironically by making it easier to double-spend. If we implement replace-by-fee nodes will always forward the transaction with the highest overall fee (including parents) even if it would double-spend a previous transaction. At first glance this appears to make double-spending trivial and zero-confirmation transactions useless, but in fact it enables a powerful counter-measure to an attempted double-spend: the merchant who was ripped off creates a subsequent transaction sending 100% of the funds to mining fees. All replace-by-fee miners will mine that transaction, rather than the one sending the funds back to the fraudster, and there is nothing the fraudster can do about it other than hope they get lucky and some one mines their double-spend before they hear about the counter spend. The transaction can also be constructed such that the payee pays slightly more in advance, with the merchant refunding the extra amount once the transaction confirms, to ensure that a double-spend will result in a net loss for the fraudster."  
Mind. Blown. As noted by Maxwell, this is an "economist's wet-dream".

Peter Todd counters that we need more off-chain transactions instead, preserving the decentralized nature of the network, and ensuring that money invested in mining equipment goes towards hashes and not infrastructure.  
I think that we need an open and honest debate, with real analysis.  
Pros of removing cap:  
- Transaction fees will be small forever  
- Scalability. Duhr  
Cons:  
- Centralization of mining will be more pronounced  
- Money will go towards bandwidth/memory instead of hashes   
  
In an optimistic scenario, like Gavin thinks, we'll just have ASIC miners built into everything. Our water heaters, space heaters, cars, cell-phones, Intel chips, etc. Everyone will get a couple cents a day net from participating.  
In the pessimistic scenario, the mining data centers naturally win on efficiency, accepting lower and lower fees while still gaining a marginal profit, leading to a few superclusters acting as a clearinghouse for transactions. US govt could easily shut these down by themselves, or regulate them.

"Yet the product of the state-owned incumbent has proved more attractive than Hayek expected."

Why can't one just continually split BTC? Everyone will just agree on smaller denominations when needed.
@_date: 2013-10-03 20:51:04
Haha, don't sweat it.  
I bought 20 at your price.  
If it's really the future, you won't be worrying about a 10% increase. 
edit: Once your account is 30 days old, and you verify identity, you can buy/sell 50 a day, 10 of them instantly will be given to you.

Your *priest* is against Bitcoin? What?  
That's bizarre. It's right to be wary of an investment that goes 500% in less than three months(smells like Ponzi), but a little weird that he's giving pronouncements that your family are following.  
My pastor would most likely want in on the action if I sat him down and told him.  
Best thing you can do is literally give a presentation to your parents, demonstrating what it does, and a light overview how.

You can opt out by not using Coinbase, but it's a fair point that they're not being forward with their methods. To be fair to them, they have a huge financial interest in their customer's money not being stolen, or random bank accounts being drained. They are probably not financially invested in your love life like the NSA is.

I don't think much. It's all open source, and being used by multiple wallets.

Putting a really tiny transaction into the chain (less than a cents worth) will probably never happen again. The blockchain is a public ledger, and space will be in demand. However, there are plenty of proposed ways to do stuff off chain, and then settle on chain.

Only if we assume each actor has perfect information.
I'm just going to venture people don't understand BTC at all, much less altcoins.
Altcoins need to be ok being on the backburner until BTC make sit big.

Showing people a blockchain will just confuse!
@_date: 2013-11-04 14:28:04
Yes they do. They moved them to all one address, giving us an easy vantage point to see them.  
Well, I suppose they could have been idiotic enough to send them to an address they have no control over, but I doubt it.
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:37:12
Do you believe BTC will succeed with &gt;10% probability? It's probably worth it. If you're doing long-term, it doesn't really matter when you buy, just buy and hold. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:01:16
But the rich and powerful already use our current currencies to control society. I don't see how this is a downgrade.

Remember that is daily views. So if that keeps up, you just need 100,000/ per day.

I'm not saying no people made out. But a lot of people got caught up and swindled when they could have just bought a modest amount of BTC with fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:01:20
There are tons of low hanging fruit. The reason there isn't real math is because it doesn't need to scale that well yet. Why waste time on phantom solutions when there is plenty to do today to improve the protocol?

We don't like forks. It punishes forking behavior. I think it's elegant, but it may *not* incentivize behavior we want in the end. That's what I'd be worried about.

I'm still buying BTC in whole chunks... this will have to change soon. Millibits, millibits, millibits. Practicing. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 14:34:52
First, it's Bitcoin as a store of value.  
Second, it's Bitcoin as a payment network.  
Third, it's Bitcoin as a currency.  
Still working through stage 1. Are we hitting stage 2 with BitPay-like services and remittances?
@_date: 2013-10-20 21:31:56
I have yet to see a coin outside of PPCoin that has a single solid reason to be considered as an alternative for BTC. And suggesting to businesses to accept any altcoin now is just insane at this point.

Their fraud-detection algorithm is wonky, and catches a lot of legit customers.  
They can add you to a white-list if you ask, so you don't get caught in it.

Psh. Thought about buying more at $270, kinda sore I didn't.

Pegging prices in BTC is so silly, and will be silly until at least 2020 in a *rosy* scenario.

My prediction: People will use banks with insurance.  
A lot of what some members of the Bitcoin community hold dear is not held dearly by the rest of the world. Having to figure out cold storage solutions is one of those.  
Good news is one doesn't HAVE to do anything with Bitcoin; All you get is choices.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:04:35
Right now there is no automatic way(other than simply sending the correct amount!) but a change address is coming in Bitcoind 0.9, and should see wide support, so each transaction will create a change address in case they need to send a refund/change.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:25:00
This is why the payment protocol will be so critical for merchants.

Or do you feel trapped because you haven't done this before?

If it magically dropped to $1 I would, but it won't. I think we agree on the rest.
@_date: 2013-10-23 16:47:56
Bubble or not, this price needs to be the new norm for a few months at least, and let the market catch up to the speculation. If it keeps attempting to go up, I'm bailing for now.

Keep at it. People get it usually. I didn't(didn't press the issue much), but my difference was only like $20/BTC, which after the last 2 months is nothing.
@_date: 2013-10-30 17:37:46
It also will allow the price to stabilize quicker, as more people will be "voting" on its price.

It's already too big to stop, politically. That ship has sailed. If that's what you mean, then it's already happened.  
If you mean retail adoption? Who knows.

Right, I don't think these are likely, just possible.  
I think our saving grace is that politicians will take bribes in BTC, and want their bribes to not be destroyed by corruption inside the ecosystem.

How can one target a stash unless the ECC algorithm is broken? For now brute force is the best we can do, and randomly guessing will just randomly run into addresses.  
If it really becomes a "problem" then we'll expand our keys, and spread out our coins like we already should be.

@_date: 2013-11-20 15:03:27
That will only happen and self-correct in 2 weeks, unless you're arguing the mining supply will wildly swing every few days, which seems extremely unlikely in an ASIC-mining economy, where the capital to buy ASICs is much larger than the money to keep them running.  
If anything we are having the problem where hashing power is going up so fast that we are getting confirmations every 5 minutes on average. This is only because of ASICs getting 100-1000x speedups over GPUs.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:51:24
It's a person's choice to trust or not trust. Don't trust them? Use the blockchain. They are here already. Just a question about how far we want to go in that direction.
