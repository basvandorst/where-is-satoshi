Yes he did, the post was removed shortly after he posted it.

this will tell you if its a valid mnemonic. The phrases can be 3,6,9,12,15,18,21 and 24 words long, so your 18 word phrase may be the answer. GL

Okay... so I think I know what the "257" is for.
When you have the correct BIP39 phrase the address corresponding to the wallet will be found at m/49'/0'/0'/0/257

Awesome!! I've not gone crazy quite yet... XD

"trust" doesn't count, the circle is a tiny bit too big. When adjusted some of the word is cut off making it not valid.

"To triumph one must look within. To Infinity and beyond. When you are close to home. X marks the spot."
I think this means that the pass phrase is hidden in the circle starting at the infinity symbol in some way and ending at the cross.

I don't think its an anagram. Non of the clues point to anything being an anagram.

Looks like there are 24 mnemonic words left when you draw a circle between the infinity sign and the cross. coincidence??
*edit Actually I've found and marked 25 but as the clue stated "-1" one of those words won't have a matching pair.

Correct, I may be barking up totally the wrong tree. Just seems like there are too many coincidences with this path for it to be random.

Yeah I think I'm gonna leave this till there are some better clues given out. Because this is just silly, I've got no idea if what I'm working out is even REMOTELY going in the right direction.

Hmmm that's an interesting concept, going to go try manipulating the picture more.
