I would assume that exchanges which are insured within the USA are probably safer. 
Also I was mainly pointing out a questionable business practice (similar to OKCoin) that now seems to be happening on bitstamp (fake volume). 
I am not advocating for any other exchange. I just want to help traders out by giving them more information.

I didnt get any messages about password reset or anything. I used to do allot of trading there when their fees were 1% then they got greedy and started charging 15%-50% so I simply stopped using their platform.
@_date: 2015-10-19 01:02:38
read what fincen says - they do not have anything to do with transactions that involve trading bitcoin for goods and services. They have "no authorita" the end.
@_date: 2015-10-11 12:05:31
they raised their fees from 1% to 15-50% a while ago - I think they can afford to absorb the loss...

Thanks for your terrific post. I tried making threads on both reddit and bitcointalk about these issues but my threads were censored/deleted/moved-to-places-where-no-one-would-find-them (I was actually temporarily banned by a mod from as well).
I have copied your comment onto bitcointalk: 
 Also It may be illegal to use fake volume trading bots now that the CFTC is involved in regulating bitcoins. Exchanges beware!!!
From the coindesk article about the CFTC getting involved in bitcoin:
 
Also note the CFTC may "conduct extraterritorial enforcement actions in this area" :

Just watch their trade on a chart site eg:  
You can observe trades (I have for over a week), that buy then instantly sell the same amount of BTC, with no slippage, again and again, likely in order to make it seem like they have a large trading volume on their site. 
Look at OKCoin trades to really see this same kind of activity on a much larger scale. Seems like Bitstamp is following suite out of desperation.

@_date: 2015-10-11 09:58:57
1) the trezor confirms the actual BTC address that you are sending to on the trezor screen regardless of what address a computer says it is sending to.
2) what I do is send a small amount of BTC and then the actual amount that I want to send only after the recipient confirms the test amount hit their account.
@_date: 2015-10-03 08:58:18
Just observe the trading and you can easily spot this sketchy behavior. Same goes for OKcoin....
@_date: 2015-10-21 04:35:09
how does glidera work? where are the USD located? I dont get it.
Are they just another exchange service like coinbase but they allow you to use your own wallet?

BTCChina seems to be well liked.
@_date: 2015-10-07 02:43:43
There should be a 1-3% discount for people who pay with bitcoins as the merchants arent charged as much fees as credit card companies and also there is no risk of a chargeback. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:31:42
By this logic you might claim OKCoin doesnt have fake volume although that is clearly what happens on their exchange. 
I wasnt saying they were insolvent, rather that they now seem to have volume bots to make it look like that trade more volume than they actually trade.

separate problem. Its just a question of depositing into the accounts of the other "middlemen". 
Or maybe theres an opportunity for products to compete with the current system.

Could be a volume bot that loses a small amount of money but tries to make the exchange seem more popular than it actually is.

it doesnt support passphrases if you use a trezor , this is a problem as many users have passphrases enabled for extra protection.

yes I tested this as well. it is pretty neat!

This is about them faking their trade volume. 
Maybe they are genuinely good people. I do not know. 
However engaging in such activity is suspicious and consumers ought to be aware of this.

people have been offering this on localbitcoins for ages. I dont get the big deal???
@_date: 2015-10-03 08:59:39
Na, thats one kind of fake volume. Just because "actual" trades take place doesnt make them "legitimate" trades. 
This is a different kind of fake volume.
@_date: 2015-10-13 02:01:18
get a trezor. cant go wrong. physical wallets are the best.
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:39:22
Quoting "deb0rk" :
Those "consistent vol spikes" are exact same kind of orders that tick by on OKC, just on a much smaller scale. The accusation for stamp isn't cooked books or faked engine trades, just wash trading though on a milder scale (prob by a 0-fee MM)
This is what it looks like on 1m:  Left is washing, right is actual trading.
If you scroll back, there are dozens of these sessions in the past weeks.

The victims are the partners of these people , not the cheaters. Now they are literally "paying the price" for their actions...
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:43:00
I can see how the price may stabilize itself from going below a certain price (if people place offers to buy all 21m coins for say $1k it can never go below that price ever again) but how can they stabilize it from going up (and then crashing straight back down making it still quite volatile).
@_date: 2015-10-11 04:29:16
people will leverage their houses to buy bitcoin in order to dump the price straight back down. No point having a bull run if the traders will dump the price straight back down!
A bull run can only work if there is real adoption from people who actually value bitcoin. Otherwise there will just be temporary spikes as traders just screw around with other traders.
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:00:39
Wash trading is illegal in the USA and they may conduct extraterritorial enforcement actions if USA customers are involved:
As highlighted by the TeraExchange case, US regulations prohibit a transaction that can be characterized as a “wash trade”, an “accommodation trade”, a “fictitious sale”, or a trade that “is used to cause any price to be reported, registered, or recorded that is not a true or bona fide price”. These provisions have been broadly applied to any situation where the CFTC believes the process by which a transaction occurs was not fair, open and competitive (unless otherwise provided for under its rules). And they create potential liability for the traders, not just the exchange.
From the coindesk article about the CFTC getting involved in bitcoin: 
@_date: 2015-10-20 04:34:30
obvious collusion, collusion is obvious...

@_date: 2015-10-02 05:10:15
Easy way to fix this is to slightly modify two factor. Just receive a text or email that confirms the bitcoin address and amount you want to send. Then have a code in the text/email that you enter on the website. 
Sort of like what a trezor does. Regardless of what the website says the trezor states what actually "will happen" eg. the exact BTC address that coins will be transferred to .
The trezor also confirms the BTC receiving address , so the exchanges can display the receiving address on their website, but they should also either text/email it so you can be sure the website isnt simply displaying a fake address.
