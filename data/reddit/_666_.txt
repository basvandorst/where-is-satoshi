Seriously getting sick of this mBTC crap, it just adds another layer of abstraction for someone trying to comprehend what bitcoins are, if they need to know that 0.001 = 1 mBTC to even understand wtf they are buying/using then that pretty much negates any benefit that might be gained by using smaller units. It's completely pointless to advocate for this system to be a universal standard since you'd constantly be converting back into satoshi anyway, and your certainly not the first person to try to advocate this, it's simply not going to happen, focus your energy doing something productive.

Both are passthrus, but the full share has a 0% dividend management fee on each weekly payout as opposed to the 5% fee on 100th of a share which is the standard among thier competitors. That's why you'll see that difference in price because that fee is factored into the market price among investors. Depending on demand however people may be willing to pay a higher price to invest in smaller increments, at that point it's all about market liquidity and sometimes it will have this effect like you are seeing. I'm new to the site aswell and I'm sure someone else can come along and give a more detailed description of how it all works, but I hope that helps.

You are wrong. See: 
and explination here:
The scenario OC is describing is where the btc/kb required to send the bulk of transactions is larger than the actual balance, this fee cannot be avoided by entering a fee of 0 on any client.
A transaction may be safely sent without fees if these conditions are met:
It is smaller than 10,000 bytes.
All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.
Its priority is large enough (see the Technical Info section below)
Otherwise, the reference implementation will round up the transaction size to the nearest thousand bytes and then add a fee of 0.0001 BTC per thousand bytes[1]. Users may increase the default 0.0001 BTC/kB fee setting, but cannot control transaction fees for each transaction. Bitcoin-Qt does prompt the user to accept the fee before the transaction is sent (they may cancel the transaction if they are not willing to pay the fee).
Note that a typical transaction is 500 bytes, so the typical transaction fee for low-priority transactions is 0.0001 BTC, regardless of the number of bitcoins sent.

Then don't attach your name to it, these guys knew the nature of the project they were developing, trying to take credit for it is just ridiculous. There is no money to be made so why bother? It's clearly not a noble cause in thier own eyes, inevitably someone will come along that approaches this concept correctly. I don't see Satoshi parading around asking for credit for what he's done, something like this requires that type of discretion. If they want recognition well tough shit, focus your energy elsewhere because there's no way to view this system as anything other than blatant money laundering, to think otherwise is extremely naive.

I meant in a more general sense, not that the idea wasn't valuable. As we're now seeing they are obviously trying to comply with all the pointless AML that wouldn't be required if they didn't see the need to take credit. It negates the whole purpose of the project which is clearly to avoid AML. To sugar-coat it otherwise is delusional.


Even if they aren't charged with anything thier name is still tainted, that's the whole point I was trying to make here. If they want to do all the leg work fine, but someone is inevitably going to implement this system the way it was originally intended to be used, their AML compliant version might as-well be tossed in the bin.

Shameless plug:  Stan's son Adam (creator of Dr. Evil paper wallet generator:  ) is working on his current open source project: CryptoWallets.org, which will eventually serve as a hub for several  high resolution wallet designs for various crypto currencies. Got an idea, design, comment, or further questions? Please feel free to contact him here: cryptowallets
You can purchase professional transparent paper wallets for various crypto currencies here: 
The source code for this project can be found in these bitmit listings.
Eventually a unique post will be made for this project when CryptoWallets.org has been fully constructed.
Thank you :)

I was tempted to by minecraft solely for the purpose of playing at bitvegas, but I couldn't justify the 30$ to lose more money, hopefully a pirate server pops up in the future
