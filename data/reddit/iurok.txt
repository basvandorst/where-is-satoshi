There is not much one needs to know. There is no need to know how Bitcoin works. Some people may *want* to learn how Bitcoin works in order to decide for themselves *whether to use it or not*. These people are ones who can understand it anyway. If you are already convinced that Bitcoin is good for you, you don't need to know all the details.
What one does need to know is *how to use* Bitcoin and *how it behaves*. The same is true for other systems. For example, you need to know:
* what is an account number,
* that bank transfers clear only on business days,
* what is the fee for a particular operation.
Actually, banks are probably worse than Bitcoin. There are multi-page terms and agreements that very few people read in full. There are multi page price lists; some people learn about the fees when they are already charged. Some banks will help customers go overdraft and charge a fee for it. A bank *can try* to make it easy, straightforward, and fair for its customers, but they can only go so far, because banks are part of the legacy financial system. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is free from many of that legacy stuff. Maybe everything that a user really needs to know about Bitcoin can be fit in one page.
However people do have problems understanding Bitcoin. There may be reasons for it.
* Some are not convinced about Bitcoin. They are not ready to embrace it.
* Most didn't have that one-page instruction when they started to use Bitcoin.
* Bitcoin is really a new kind of money that works in a new way. Those who fail to understand it, will have a problem.
* Price volatility.

When a new address (either receive or change) is needed, it is taken from the key pool. Default pool size is 100 keys. It is adjustable by "keypool" option. The pool remembers the order in which keys were added. Keys are taken in the same order. I.e. the key that is used is the oldest. Once the key is used, it is removed from the pool.
If the wallet is not "encrypted", a new key is added to the pool as soon as one is taken. If the wallet is "encrypted", the pool is refilled whenever you enter the password. This is because keys in the pool are encrypted with the password.

If holding was the point, it would be a pure speculative bubble, perhaps. People would hold whatever asset is best for them in terms of returns and risks. And as soon as some asset stops being the best, people would want to exchange it for a better asset, making the first asset even worse. And so it crashes badly. But if the asset also useful for *something other than holding*, it will not crash to zero. And only knowing that, most people would want to continue to hold it anyway.

* Double-spend. Only one of these can be included in the main block chain. Others become invalid and get deleted.
* Modified transaction. A transaction can be modified in such a way that preserves its meaning (same coins go to the same addresses) but changes representation. These transactions will have different identifiers and will be treated the same as double-spends.
* Low fee. It can be mined eventually. It can be overridden with a transaction that has an appropriate fee (maybe). In this latter case it will be treated as a double-spend. If neither happens, IDK.
* Non-standard transaction. Either someone will decide to mine it, or it will be deleted from the network.

Each block header has a timestamp that *should* specify block creation time. A miner can  put a timestamp that is slightly off. But blocks with obviously incorrect timestamps will be rejected.
I guess, it works this way: Bitcoin nodes tell the current time to each other. Each node has 2 clocks: local computer clock and "average network time" of connected nodes. These clocks are used to validate timestamps.

ASIC hosting *is* mining centralization. Much more so than public mining pools.
If something happens to a pool, individual miners can switch to another pool. If someone takes control of your facility and uses it to attack Bitcoin, what do we do?
Also, suppose someone has accumulated a large portion of hash power. They then attack other mining pools and facilities to force others offline, so they will have more than 50% of the total. If a mining pool goes down, individual miners can *automatically* switch to another pool. Now if an attacker cuts off your electric power, what do we do?
@_date: 2014-06-09 08:59:33
Most users don't care about miners, even less about miners of a specific pool. Miners' fees should be computed automatically, because many users don't know how Bitcoin works. When a wallet app asks: "Do you want to add a miners' fee?", user doesn't know the right answer at that point. Instead of complicating things for everyone, I would ask for donations from those who care.

Bitcoin has a loose definition of coin ownership. For every "coin", some requirement is specified. Whoever knows how to satisfy the requirement, can use (send) that coin.
For most coins, the requirement is a valid digital signature using a specific key. By looking for such coins we can compute what coins are available to what key. This is how balances are computed.
But other kinds of requirements are also possible. It allows us to invent new kinds of transactions – contracts. This is important, because it helps building different kinds of financial services on top of Bitcoin. What useful feature is missing in Bitcoin, can be introduced in a higher-level system.

Not the same thing. An address contains a hash of a public key, but not the key itself. Sending bitcoins to an address means sending to a hash of a public key. When you spend these bitcoins, you have to reveal the corresponding public key and sign with the secret key. It is also possible to send bitcoins directly to a public key, but usually the corresponding key is not known to the sender beforehand.
If you spend each bitcoin separately, we will not see that these 10 addresses belong to the same person. But if you send, say, 1.5 BTC, you will need to combine 2 of your coins, and we will see that they belonged to the same person.
Some hosted wallet services mix all the coins. In such case we see that 10 BTC went to the service. When you spend your bitcoins, we see that the service sent some bitcoins out. The service itself knows which user has which addresses.

Unlike banking and e-money systems, Bitcoin addresses are *not* account identifiers. A Bitcoin wallet has multiple addresses and that number normally increases with time. Bitcoin addresses should be used as **payment purpose** identifiers. When you need to receive coins, you take a new address and show it to the payer. If the address receives the expected amount of bitcoins, you know that the payment is complete.
Now if you want to present to the payer some meaningful information instead of just some cryptic Bitcoin address, there is a [payment protocol]( for it.

One of common mistakes is that users paste the wrong address. Since a new address can be used for each transaction, people have to deal with a bunch of addresses.

My Bitcoin program has a confirmation dialogue that lists the addresses and amounts, and I have to check them every time.

Because Bitcoin is a kind of "trustless" system, validity of every transaction must be proven. This includes showing where the coins come from. And coins come from previous transactions.

One problem of the fractional reserve banking is that the storage function is mixed with the investment function. If a bank makes bad investments, it affects all deposits. With deflationary currency, it makes sense to separate these functions.
For storage you can use a deposit box with private keys. You can send bitcoins to that box at any time, but to use the saved money you need to physically access the contents of the box. The bank should not touch the contents of the deposit box at all.
An investment account can multiply your bitcoins. But it can also burn if the bank makes bad investment. You accept the risk, and you are responsible for choosing a bank that makes good investments.

There is not much competition in CPU performance. We are still using x86 architecture that is so old that modern processors maybe have a different instruction set and something like a virtual machine that executes x86 code. x86 has features that do not make sense for today's computers, but are kept for compatibility. Imagine how many excess components are required on the IC for the CPU to work this way. And we do not switch to some modern CPU architecture because x86 is OK. It works good enough for users.
As for an actual compromise, you can do it in software. You can insert your back-door in BIOS. And not only BIOS. Computers also have other pieces of firmware that are executed on the CPU: some are read from PCI devices, some of which can be on the mainboard or even in the CPU itself. So flashing your own BIOS may not be enough to get rid of back-doors. And CPUs already have features that can be used to subvert the OS, like [SMM]( and [virtualization]( I have seen reports of BIOSes that actually boot OS in a "virtual machine". This way it can intervene with any function of your software; for example, signing Bitcoin transactions.

Currently, most merchants don't want to hold bitcoins. Payment processors exchange bitcoins automatically right away. And who wants to get these bitcoins anyway?

If one pool (no matter what its internal organization is) begins to aggressively prioritize its blocks, there will be more rejected blocks (so called "orphans") in the network.
If the pool is a small one, most of these lost blocks will be of that same pool. Everyone else's profits will increase.
If that is a large pool, most of the lost blocks will be of other pools, which will be concerned about it. Let A be a large self-prioritizing pool. Let B and C be smaller pools, but B + C &gt; A. To protect their profits B and C agree to prioritize each other's blocks and de-prioritize A's blocks. Other pools will want to join either side to protect their profits. What we've got here is a miners' war. Cartels of mining pools will be competing with each other until all the survived pools unite in one cartel. Between these pools the rule of the longest chain will be effectively restored, but there will be no entry to the market for new pools.

* E-money, such as PayPal. I hope I don't need to tell you how bad PayPal is. In general, with any e-money system, she has to agree to some tl;dr ToS written in legalese. And then she has her money frozen and she doesn't know why.
* Bank. Not good for international transfer of small amounts such as one-time payments for jobs.
* Money transmitter service, such as Western Union. Often expensive for small amounts.
* Cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin. Give them your address and have your bitcoins spendable in minutes. No ToS, no freezes, no restrictions. Very low fees. And you can get discounts when spending Bitcoins.

A Bitcoin transaction consists primarily of inputs and outputs. Inputs specify where coins are coming from. Outputs specify where coins are going to. This, transfer of coins, constitutes a transaction.
All bitcoins are stored in unspent transaction outputs (UTXO). Owning bitcoins means having keys from some UTXO. Every transaction creates new outputs – "cells" that store coins. Every output specifies what is needed to spend the coins from the "cell". Usually required is a digital signature that proves knowledge of a particular secret key. The amount of coins in every "cell" is specified in the transaction output. The sum of output amounts is usually less than the sum of input amounts. The difference is the transaction fee.
Every transaction input (except coinbase) refers to an output of a previous transaction. It adds to the transaction the full amount of the referenced output. Every output can be used only once. Once referenced, an output becomes "spent". Also a transaction input contains a proof of the right to spend the referenced coins.

Merchants carry the risk of chargebacks. The cost is included in prices. You set prices, say, 10% higher, so 9 legitimate purchases cover losses to 1 successful fraud. Also merchants try to reduce fraud by refusing to accept payments in certain cases.

Proof of work is used to achieve a consensus, a common view of the ledger in a distributed network. This is the most important innovation of the Bitcoin technology. Crypto-money technology existed before Bitcoin, but none of the previous systems was successful. Maybe because they required some central authority. Satoshi has managed to replace that authority with a consensus mechanism, making a new kind of distributed systems possible. Bitcoin is the first such system.
A consensus based on proof of work is inherently vulnerable to an entity with enough computing power. Thanks to ASICs, Bitcoin network has so much computing power that no other technology can beat it. However, economic incentives of Bitcoin technology drive mining industry towards centralization. Large pools and farms are more efficient than small ones. Also, all ASICs (chips themselves) are produced in few places. This centralization makes it possible for an entity with enough power to actually take over Bitcoin mining.
There are alternatives to proof of work, but they have their own unsolved problems.

This attack has a cost: the attacker mines in the pool that is suffering from the attack. This cost is proportional to the impact of the attack. So, the bigger the share of the total attackers' hash rate in the pool, the greater is the cost of the attack.
If one throws lots of hash power to attack a small pool, it will have a big impact and a high cost. If they attack a big pool with lots of faithful hash power, the impact and the cost will be lower.

It depends on how you use Bitcoin. It allows for somewhat strong anonymity. But for most users the anonymity is quite low. 
Some wallets have personal set of private keys. Examples: Bitcoin Core, Blockchain.info wallet. If someone knows your identity and one of your used addresses, (with time) they can find out all your addresses and see all your transactions. For example, when you buy online, you tell them your name and address. When you pay, they see where the coins come from. So they know your identity and your Bitcoin addresses. DarkWallet has "pockets" and CoinJoin mixing, which you can use to protect your anonymity, so they won't know all your transactions.
Some wallets have private keys shared among users. Examples: Coinbase, EasyWallet. As with any hosted service, they can see all your transactions.

Right now, if you just want to obtain bitcoins, mining is one of the worst options, unless you have specific needs. So, the future is practically not different from the current situation.
How do you obtain fiat money? Maybe you work, maybe you trade, maybe you have your business, maybe someone gives you money. These same ways you can obtain bitcoins.
When all coins are minted, miners will be collecting only transaction fees. Also, mining doesn't have to be profitable. Interested parties can participate in securing the block chain by running mining hardware partly paid for by Bitcoin-related business proceedings.

Option 1. Buy bitcoins with cash from a party that does not require your identification.
Option 2. Buy bitcoins non-anonymously, then anonymize them and send to your new wallet. One way to anonymize bitcoins:
* Exchange BTC to some anonymous currency like Monero.
* Create a new one-use anonymous account on a cryptocurrency exchange.
* Exchange *part* of your anonymous currency back to Bitcoin.
* Withdraw the anonymous bitcoins to your anonymous wallet.
* Hold the remaining anonymous currency for some time before using it.

Bitcoin Core finds out its IP address on startup. It advertises it to the network, so other nodes can connect to it. When IP address changes, Bitcoin has to discover and advertise it again.

Bitcoin notices lost connections and establishes up to 8 outgoing connections.

I have 2 answers to this question.
**Yes**. Blocks are coming at slightly slower pace after difficulty retarget than before retarget. Then, as network computing power grows, average block rate increases again until next retarget.
**No**. Difficulty increases only if blocks are coming faster than they should. So, difficulty increase implies that average confirmation times were shorter. Conversely, difficulty decrease would imply that blocks were coming too slowly.

As for the "good" parts of the proposal, some of them are inappropriate, regulatory ways to solve the problems for which technical and free market solutions possible. I find the proposed ways inappropriate because Bitcoin doesn't work the way the legacy financial system works. In many aspects, Bitcoin is a new kind of thing that was never seen before. If you don't fully accept its novelty, you will fail to do any good for the Bitcoin. And I suspect, they do not intend to do any good anyway. They need to "sell" their regulations, that's why they present it (in the summary) in a way that sounds OK. The regulation itself for the most part is not OK at all.

Who is *not* vulnerable to this attack? Private pools with trusted participants. It can be a large mining corporation that has its own pool. And this is a worse form of mining centralization.
If an adversary takes control of servers of a large public pool and starts an attack on Bitcoin network, it will quickly become apparent, and miners will have the incentive to leave the rogue pool and join a good pool.
If an adversary takes control of a large mining plant and starts a sophisticated attack, we have a huge trouble.

If an input adds more to the transaction fee (on average) than it adds value, then it's practically worthless (until transaction fees will drop). Let average transaction input size be 150 bytes.

All bitcoins are stored in the block chain. All full nodes have a copy of it, so it will not be lost. What you have is keys for some bitcoins. If you lose your keys, your bitcoins become useless. You can put a copy of your keys to a deposit box in a bank vault. So, such entities do exist.

I guess, for most Bitcoin services, the current license terms are unacceptable, and then there is also a fee. So they will have to deny service to affected customers. So you will have to enter your address on every service, even, for example, easywallet.org.
And for every service that does have a license you will have to submit KYC data.
So you either ignore the regulation, or give up many of benefits of Bitcoin.

Accepting unconfirmed transactions is always a risk. But you can do something to reduce the risk.
* Make sure you are connected to some honest nodes.
* Check that the transaction is not of strange form and is not large.
* Check that all the inputs are confirmed.
* Check that the fee is enough.
* Broadcast the transaction to many nodes (good if some miners are among them).
* Wait few seconds.
* Check that there are no conflicting transactions in the network.
These measures raise cost of double-spend fraud. If the cost of double-spend is greater than the payment, there is no incentive to cheat. However, if a fraudster teams up with a miner, the cost of double-spend drops significantly.
If there is no fraud, but a transaction remains unconfirmed, it should be possible to add a fee, I think.

Let the total pool rewards be 100 BTC per some time interval. Attackers join the pool, increasing the total hash rate by 5%. If they were honest miners, the total pool rewards would be 105 BTC per the same interval, of which the attackers would earn **5 BTC**, which is about 4.76% of the total. But attackers do not submit block solutions, so the total pool rewards will still be 100 BTC, of which 4.76% (**4.76 BTC**) go to the attackers, and the rest (**95.24 BTC**) go to faithful miners.
Total attackers' losses: 5 BTC - 4.76 BTC = **0.24 BTC**
Total faithful miners' losses: 100 BTC - 95.24 BTC = **4.76 BTC**
So, in this case faithful miners lose in total 20 times more than attackers.

You can try to send without a fee. But let's say, no transaction is confirmed without a proper fee, which is how it is supposed to be in the future. So, only part of your balance is spendable. Your balance is shown as 0.2 BTC, but its value is, say, 0.1999 BTC (the amount you can actually use). The more fragmented are your bitcoins, the greater fee is required, the lesser is their value.
For comparison, let's suppose, you have $1000 in a bank account. Suppose, there is no way to send or withdraw money without paying a fee. The cheapest option is, say, ACH transfer for $0.25. So, the value of your account is $999.75.

You can create any number of new addresses. Millions, if you like. They all will be valid. The network does not need to know about these addresses until they are used in transactions.
The network does not keep track of who owns which address. The whole concept of ownership in Bitcoin is different. Whoever knows how to unlock coins, can use them. When you create a new address, you create a secret key and an associated address. When I send bitcoins to that address, I just mark some bitcoins as unlockable with whatever secret key is associated with that address. Your wallet software recognizes the transaction and adds the bitcoins to your balance.

There are advantages of having shorter block time target.
If you spend the change before the previous transaction got confirmed, your transaction is vulnerable to malleability. So, it makes sense to wait for 1 confirmation before sending the next transaction. With shorter target you have to wait less on average.
There is less variance with shorter target time. Let's suppose you want 25 minutes worth of PoW before you accept the payment. In Bitcoin it corresponds to about 3 blocks. Sometimes you get 3 confirmations in 5 minutes, sometimes in 40 minutes. In a system with 1 minute block target time, 25 minutes worth of PoW corresponds to about 25 blocks. And in 25 blocks you will have much less variance.

You can send even 1 satoshi, but you will have to pay a fee that is greater than the transacted value. Every transaction is stored for indefinite time on thousands of nodes. So, the self-cost of a transaction is probably more than 5¢. Currently, micro-transactions are possible because miners are paid mainly by block rewards. The original intention was that a good part of miner's earnings will be from transaction fees. So, I expect the fees to increase. Yes, the block chain is not for micro-transactions. But then there are off-chain transactions that have instant confirmation and very low self-cost.

Whenever you deposit bitcoins to your account within a service like an exchange, IOU is created. The service owes you money until you withdraw or spend them. So, most users participate in making credits anyway, even if it is not called "credit".
Ripple supports these kinds of transactions, but also makes it possible to spend money before sending them. Whether to use that additional feature or not, is decided by every user and their contact.
If you are OK with crediting an exchange service, you set your credit limit for that service to the amount that you are going to deposit. Then you send bitcoins to the service, and the service sends you back its IOU's. You can then use these IOU's within the Ripple system. The exchange, in theory, can connect you to many other services, some of them through additional intermediary parties.
An exchange, on the other hand, doesn't have to trust all its users, so it sets credit limits to zero. Although it can have mutual trust with some of its partners, and these connections can be used for payments between users of different systems.

There are ways of trading bitcoins efficiently. For example, with Dwolla and Mt. Gox, total fees that average user pays are below 1%. For many, there are other possibilities as well. For others, though, trading bitcoins is still expensive. But besides Bitcoin, there are other expensive systems, and they are being used, and not just for illegal activities. Bank wire transfer is not cheap and it is used. WU and MoneyGram are not cheap and they are used. For plastic card transactions, merchants pay 3%-4% in fees, users often pay various fees too, and they are happily used like everywhere on the web.
In my practice, almost all Bitcoin transactions go from a sender to a receiver in seconds. As soon as they received a transaction, they can verify it. At this point, the transaction is reversible, but if there is no point for a sender in trying to reverse the transaction, there is no need in waiting for confirmations. Look at these examples of in-person Bitcoin transactions (first 3 videos): 
And whenever both confirmation and speed are needed, it is possible to use trusted third party, like eWallet, as 2FB7B452 pointed out.
In some areas, Bitcoin provides much greater advantages over other payment methods, like in the example of Silk Road. And in many other areas, it is still advantageous, but only to a small extent, so not many people bother spending their time and other resources on learning about Bitcoin and starting using it. Those who already started, already benefit from it (here I am talking about activities unrelated to black markets).

For a fork to happen, the smaller part of the network needs **both** pools and miners (or powerful solo miners). I assume that during network split most miners will be disconnected from their abroad pools. Knowing about netsplit, there will be no motivation for the miners to look for local pools, as they are going to lose the reward anyway. Things like p2pool may continue to work, though. In any case, there is no motivation to mine during full netsplit, so the active computing power is supposed to drop significantly. So, the probability of creation of even a single block in the smaller network is not nigh, I think.
So, most likely, transactions originated in the smaller network will stay unconfirmed, which will be clear for Bitcoin users. It will be an opportunity for fraudsters, but it will mainly affect those who **decide** to take the risk of accepting unconfirmed transactions. Legitimate unconfirmed transactions will be eventually confirmed in the main block chain.
And as was stated by others, it takes only a single link between the networks to keep them relatively in sync, no mater if the link is very laggy, like moving physical medium. There is a motivation for trying to establish such a link for users interested in continuing using Bitcoin, such as sellers, for example.

Is there a paper or an article that describes that multisig-with-third-party-fast-transaction scheme?
@_date: 2012-11-19 21:21:34
The article is about Bitcoin in general and not about the foundation. It is still unclear to me, what actual things they do.
@_date: 2013-07-14 10:50:51
Also, bitcoins themselves are not more secure than the underlying crypto. ECDSA, SHA-2, and RIPEMD-160 are used in a typical transaction. Of them, I think, ECDSA will be broken first. By the time it happens, you will have to move your bitcoins.

In a country where I live, begging is a kind of business. I normally ignore beggars, but when they appeal to me personally, I say: "OK, give me your Bitcoin address, I will send you some bitcoins." I wonder if one day one of them will say: "OK, here is my address, thank you!" :D

Vendor backdoors use public key crypto. The public keys are embedded into OS. Vendor, as well as intelligence agencies, have corresponding secret keys. Knowledge about the backdoor won't help you unless you have the secret key.
Also, those "backdoors" are unlike your average malware. The code may have legitimate functions. Still, it grants third parties greater access to your system than you would expect.
@_date: 2013-06-10 18:45:02
One possibility. Modern computers have virtualization technology that allows installation of supervising code of which OS is unaware. The code can be stored in ROM (BIOS or other). Interestingly, such code was detected on motherboards from China.
@_date: 2013-07-13 00:40:30
I think, Bitcoin is neither anonymous nor pseudonymous. Bitcoin protocol does not have a concept of user or account. So, there are no pseudonyms and no account numbers. You can create those concepts on top of Bitcoin, but you don't have to. Bitcoin is not anonymous because bitcoins are traceable. But mixers easily remove traces of a given coin.

Actually, it seems, they follow the "everything which is not allowed is forbidden" principle. So it can be illegal even in the absence of applicable laws.

Yeah. At least in terms of sync time. Not only the transaction volume increased significantly at some point in 2012. With time, it also becomes more and more difficult to validate an average transaction. Every "input" has to be matched with a previous "output", and these outputs can be scattered through the block chain. One can be from today's transaction, another can be from a 3 year old transaction. The larger the data set, the harder is it to work with.

Your bitcoins are safe until NSA (or whoever installs bugs in your devices) has interest in them. It is unlikely that current bugs are capable of seizing bitcoins, but such functionality may be a matter of remote update. You can store secret keys off computer, but whenever you need to use them, they are at risk again. To protect you bitcoins you would have to:
* use a separate device to sign transactions (an always offline computer or a hardware wallet);
* make sure that any device that ever had secret keys on it *never* connects to any network, even when sending bitcoins;
* review all signed transactions.
Also, paper wallets and such can be physically seized.

Exactly. Bitcoin promotes freedom. Nobody tells me what to do with my bitcoins, unless I ask. Nobody tells me whether I should hold my bitcoins or trade them for another currency or for goods and services. I make my own decisions.
People share ideas with others. If one wishes, he may support the idea by his actions. Another one may oppose the idea. Or one can do nothing about it. Bitcoin itself is a realization of a great idea, and we support the idea by using Bitcoin.
As for buying stuff vs. exchanging for fiat, either of the options may be more beneficial than the other in terms of money. One may behave rational and always choose least cost options. Another one may be willing to support Bitcoin merchants even if their offer is not the best one available. Yet another one may see Bitcoin only as means of profiting (by mining or speculation) and exchanges bitcoins as soon as it's a good time for the exchange and holds fiat, which is also fine.
@_date: 2013-06-26 13:18:12
Here is a reason for me personally. Let's suppose I want to buy Humble Indie Bundle. The payment options are:
* PayPal – no way, I don't want to touch this
* Amazon Payments
* Google Checkout – I have had bad experience with this
* Bitcoin
Basically my choice is between Amazon and Bitcoin. Let's suppose I don't have bitcoins. I need to either get bitcoins and send them to HB or:
* load my card;
* agree to some Amazon TOS;
* add my card info;
* possibly do whatever else Amazon will require;
* and hopefully, if everything succeeds, actually pay.
There *are* extra steps, and I choose the path that is most convenient for me, which is Bitcoin.

Maybe. I don't claim that my understanding is correct. I think, the video was made to assure that there are no serious liquidity problems besides banking operations taking too much time to process all the withdrawal requests in a timely fashion. But if it's true then the customers moving to other exchanges (whether because of fears or other reasons) should eventually *help* the situation.

I think, police will not help the seller.
* The seller did not lose money (legal tender).
* The buyer have not received anything valuable from seller.
* Bitcoins are being held by LocalBitcoins. LocalBitcoins is liable, not the buyer.
* It may be unclear whether transfer of bitcoins within LocalBitcoin constitutes transfer of value or not, according to applicable laws.
One way to resolve this dispute is for the **buyer to go to the police**. If he paid dollars for something that was promised and the promise was not fulfilled, he can demand the money back. Then the seller can provide documents confirming that the case was resolved through the police.

If Bitcoin is to replace a large payment system, the value of bitcoin has to go up dramatically. That makes a big additional motivation for miners. The higher is bitcoin's value, the more money gets spent on mining. A part of that money goes to buy hardware, a part goes to buy electric power. Also, not only miners, but all full nodes will be consuming more power to process greatly increased amount of transactions. So **with increased Bitcoin adoption, its power consumption also increases**. However, ASIC "arms race" *may* cause miners to spend larger share of their expenses on the hardware and smaller share on the electricity. Still, the total consumption of electric power by the whole network will likely increase.

Yeah, Bitcoin has seen some regulation. When a large fork happens, one of the "tails" has to be chosen and given preference over the others to restore consensus. It happened with Bitcoin in March. One "tail" was mined by nodes running older, buggy bitcoind; the other one was mined by nodes running newer, correct version. The decision was made in favor of the buggy nodes. I don't know who made the decision; I guess it's Bitcoin devs and miners.
I guess, *coin devs see forks in their nightmares. :)

You can transact anonymously. For example, if you are buying and selling digital goods, you don't have to disclose your infos.
"Anyone who have had a deal with you" is not "anyone" in general.
In transactions where you have to reveal your identity, you can use a web-wallet (one with shared pool of addresses). But this is already a kind of mixing.

As for Bitcoin, as transaction volume increases, I bet, regular users' nodes will have problem keeping up with the network.

And I don't even speak about initial synchronization.

Bictoins are being sent to "scripts" that determine who is allowed to move coins further. Most scripts represent Bitcoin addresses (they contain corresponding public keys or hashes). We consider that these coins are owned by owners of corresponding public keys. But some other types of transactions are also allowed, which do not contain any addresses. Here is an example:
If you add up balances of all addresses, coins sent to such unusual scripts will not be included in the sum. Also, there are multisig transactions, in which coins are owned collectively by owners of corresponding private keys.
Putting aside multisig transactions and some manually created transactions, we can assume that one who creates a transaction owns all private keys that correspond to all inputs addresses of the transaction. By grouping all addresses that appeared together in transaction inputs, it is possible to estimate wallet balances. I think, here they did something like that:

Another solution is to store with a trusted party a signed transaction that distributes coins among heirs. After your death, the heirs receive their copies of the transaction, and one of them broadcasts the transaction.
In this scheme, one needs to submit a new version of the will transaction every time something changes about it.

For some people, though, there is a clear advantage. Everyone can have his own reasons. There is no point in talking about all people of the world en masse.

Bitcoin has utility for many people and thus has value in itself. It does not need to be backed by something else. If a currency is backed by something, the backing is usually provided by some central authority. Bitcoin eliminates the need for such authority and any risks associated with it.

How about this. Merchant delivers the good. Customer claims that he received a brick in a box. He uses social media to express his fake indignation. He requests refund or replacement from the merchant. The latter has the following options:
* Claim that they shipped the good and that the customer is a scammer. The same thing the merchant could do if they actually sent a brick in a box. So the merchant a kind of does look like a scam. In your model, where one scam report discredits a business, the merchant is fucked.
* Offer a refund. The customer sends back a brick in a box and gets the good for free.
* Offer a reshipment. The customer sends back a brick in a box and gets two items for the price of one.

To issue IOU, user A sets trust to user B; user B sends the currency to user A within Ripple. It's simple as that.
To work as a gateway, user B issues IOUs in exchange for the underlying currency.
* Users A and C set trust to user B.
* User A sends money to B outside Ripple.
* User B sends money (IOU) to A within Ripple.
* A can pay to C within Ripple, no trust is required between A and C.
* User C, if wishes, can redeem the IOU. He sends money to B within Ripple.
* User B sends money to C outside Ripple.
To create an automated gateway, a user needs to connect it to Ripple and some other money transfer system. The Ripple client API is public and open-sourced.
OpenCoin wants gateways to exist, and the more, the better. But owning any gateways themselves would be unwise. Accounting of IOUs for users is an information service. Accepting legal tender and being liable for it is money service.


Liberty Reserve is unrelated to Liberty Dollar.
I agree that OpenCoin is vulnerable. I disagree with an argument presented in the article. OpenCoin does not issue dollars or anything similar to dollars.

What *may* happen is decrease of number of full nodes despite increasing number of users. This is bad, because Bitcoin security model requires large number of full nodes.
Current Bitcoin software does not scale well enough to accommodate the anticipated future transaction volume. However, improvements can be made so the software will be able to handle it, and they are being worked on.
The biggest pain in the ass is the initial synchronization. I think, in the future nodes will not be starting with download and verification of the full block chain from block 0 to the current block. Instead, the process may be something like this:
* download and verify block header chain;
* download current UTXO DB;
* partially verify the UTXO with SPV;
* start normal operation (mining is also possible);
* download full block chain in reverse order to verify the UTXO.
Verification of UTXO with SPV is quite insecure, so, additional means of verification have to be implemented.

I have Bitcoins in a local wallet. I spend a little on online services: hosting, domain names, etc. Sometimes I buy small goods from web stores. I don't buy big things, because I would have to pay a lot in local currency for delivery. Recently I bought some downloads mostly out of curiosity.

@_date: 2013-07-15 19:09:04
I think, the idea will mostly not work in the current situation. The whole process has these steps:
1. Delivery of local currency to agent 1.
2. Conversion of local currency to bitcoins.
3. Delivery of bitcoins to agent 2.
4. Conversion of bitcoins to local currency.
5. Delivery of local currency to the receiver.
Any step (maybe, except 3) can be slow, costly, and problematic. But the whole process must be fast, cheap, and robust to attract customers.
In few places the conditions can be favorable, though. For example, if you send money from USA to Argentina. Agent 1 buys bitcoins from Coinbase, agent 2 delivers the local currency and later sells the bitcoins on a P2P market at a high rate, which covers the expenses of the whole process.

Authorities will likely keep pressing Bitcoin; buying bitcoins through exchanges may get much harder. So stop whining and hurry to buy some while you can! :)
Alternatively, go P2P. Eventually, P2P trade may become the primary way to get bitcoins. Effective trade will be among vital skills of a future bitcoiner.
1. Find sellers. There are services dedicated to P2P trading:  LocalBitcoins, Bitcoinary, and others. Most Bitcoin forums have sections for trading.
2. Find trustworthy sellers. Currently, trust is crucial in Bitcoin economy. There are no chargebacks or reversals. You generally send bitcoins to those whom you trust. You should be able to tell which individual or business you can trust. However, read (3).
3. There is escrow, use one if needed. Some marketplaces have built-in escrow service. Otherwise find a service that both you and your counterparty trust.
4. If you have not found any offers that you like, place your own ad.
5. Build good reputation from successful deals. Reputation is of great value in an unregulated economy.

A problem with CPC and (to some extent) CPM is that you have to counter cheating. A cheater can click on the ad (or download the ad for CPM) using many different IP addresses. He then collects the compensation without generating useful traffic for the advertisers. The system has to be monitored for cheating attempts, which costs money.

[Key Disclosure Laws Can Be Used To Confiscate Bitcoin Assets](
But Bitcoin secret key is *not* an encryption key. There is no data encrypted with that key. To require you to disclose the key, the prosecution has to present the data that is supposedly encrypted with it, I think. Whatever they have, you just state that you don't possess any encryption keys, and that's true. That's if you memorize just the secret key and don't have anything else encrypted.

Inflation rate can never be more than 100%. After 100% decrease, the value is zero. It just can't go down any further. Percentage is a bad way to measure change in value. 50% inflation (2x decrease in value) is more significant than 50% deflation (1.5x increase in value). A better way would be a change on a logarithmic scale. On that scale, 50% inflation is -69 points; 50% deflation is +41 points.
Projection of short-term changes to longer terms does not make sense for investors. Day traders don't care about long-term changes in the rate. Long-term investors will just have to hold the asset for longer, until it regains value. For example, if your goal is to double your dollars, and you bought bitcoins at $31.91 on June 8, 2011, which is the worst case, you sell at $64 on March 20, 2013. It's 651 days or 1.78 years. If you bought on any other date since July, 2010 (earliest mtgoxUSD data available on bitcoincharts), it would take much less time to double your investment.
As for peso vs. bitcoin, 30% inflation is -36 points. Greatest over-a-year decrease in BTC/USD rate is from peak at $31.91 on June 8, 2011 to $5.56 on June 8, 2012. It's -175 points. Bitcoin still looks much worse. But if you exclude speculative bubbles, Bitcoin shows growth rather than decline.

Whatever FinCEN says, not all money transactions fall within their area of competence. For example, receiving money from your employer and giving it to a merchant in exchange for goods does not constitute a money transmitting service, because you do it for yourself. In the same vein, receiving money from customers and giving it to employees and suppliers is not a money service. Basically, any service that you do for yourself is not business in itself.
Also, FinCEN guidelines is not law. They can be used to threaten persons, but they are useless in court. As for the law, the definitions of MSB and MT explicitly excludes many kinds of activity. You can read it here:

While Bitcoin surely has big opponents, but the idea of using *Ripple* to subvert Bitcoin sounds ridiculous. OpenCoin and its backers *may* have malicious intentions. I don't have a basis to affirm or disprove it. Neither does the author, I suppose. His statement is an opinion given without arguments.
Personally I believe that OpenCoin develops a technology that will be useful in the cryptocurrency world. Whether *their* Ripple will turn out to be good or bad, it will likely inspire other technologies that will improve upon it.


It is misleading to use this Bitcoin terminology to describe Ripple. What is premining? It is where the system is supposed to reward competing miners for their hard work, but the creators start mining before the the system goes public, taking advantage of lack of competition. Most consider it unfair, some think it's OK. But generally, systems without premining are preferred over systems with large premining.
Now to Ripple. AFAIK, Ripple does not have a concept of mining. Nothing can be mined or pre-mined. There is not supposed to be a competition for some issued currency. Ripple's model is different from Bitcoin's. OpenCoin did issue a currency and assigned the whole amount to it to itself initially. They could come up with a different idea for XRP distribution. But how much does it matter? Unlike BTC in Bitcoin, XRP does not play the central role in Ripple. The intended use for the ripples is to protect the network from flooding attacks. As such, XRP is supposed to have some real value, but only to the extent required for the network to function. You are not expected to invest in ripples, or accept them as a payment, or ask others to accept them (you can do, though, if you like). Ripple is designed to work with existing currencies, and those are "issued" into the system by the *users*. And *that* concept is central to Ripple. Call the XRP model unfair or suboptimal, but it does not matter as much as it would in "altcoins"; and it definitely cannot be called "pre-mining".
Next is a comment by Nick O'Dell.
















There is indeed a pressure against cryptocurrencies in U.S., and it is unavoidable. But IOUs are not considered privately issued currencies. The Liberty Dollar case has a little relation to Ripple, if at all.

In most sectors, a good company *cares* about its customers, it does not act *against* them. In money services sector, most companies don't try to be good at all, it seems. Banks will make it very easy for you to overdraft and will charge a fee (for example, by delaying the information about outgoing transactions in the displayed balance). Most payment systems will freeze your account when *someone else* fucked up. It's not hard to understand why they do so, but it's just bullshit.
Imagine a man buying something for $10 in a store and paying with $100 note. Then he walks away with the purchase and the change. An hour later a police officer walks in and checks all cash in the pay desk. After checking numbers on all the notes he says: "This $100 note was stolen, I am taking it and giving it back to the lawful owner." Result: the store is robbed of $100. And it could be worse. The police could take the cash register away for the time of investigation (an analogy to freezing an account).
This is the reality. You will have hard time looking for a good service that moves fiat. And that service will eventually either become bad or be smashed by the power. Bitcoin is like the first chance to replace the corrupt system by something (hopefully) better, but the process is going to be difficult.

The best way to filter transactions is through mining. In current system miners are free to decide which transactions to include in blocks. Here is my scheme.
* Make a blacklist of UTXO that you want to "arrest".
* Publish the list. State that any transactions that spend blacklisted UTXO should be considered invalid.
* Get mining pools with total more than 50% of power implement the blacklist.
If any miner generates a block with a blacklisted transaction, it will be considered invalid and eventually orphaned by the majority. The miner loses the block reward and keeps losing until he throws away all the blacklisted transactions. So, the rest of the miners are forced to implement the blacklist too. Blocked transactions never confirm.
This is one of 51% attacks.

Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies rely on consensus between nodes. When all nodes agree which blocks are in the chain, you know that all transactions in those blocks are final. Fork happens when there is no consensus. During that time you don't know which blocks will end up in the main chain. You may not know if a particular transactions is final or not. The same effect would be if blocks were not generated at all.
To reach consensus all nodes follow the same rules. One rule is that the chain with the greatest amount of proof (of work or whatever is used in the currency) is considered the main chain. It does not matter who generated the blocks and for what purpose. If blocks are technically valid, they are considered when determining the "longest" chain. That's a simple rule. If you make it more complicated, it may make the consensus more fragile. If you put a committee of people to make decisions in certain situations, one controversial situation will eventually arise, that will lead to a fork.
In short: forks are bad because they defeat the main purpose of the block chain.

There are some services that can be used for the purpose.
But letting some party to hold your Bitcoin keys would be unwise. Bitcoins can be confiscated in bulk from a central storage.
Information that is stored on such services should be useless without other parts owned by heirs. A half of a secret key is not useless, it makes cracking the full key much easier. A cryptographic secret sharing scheme can be used to split the secret among independent parties. In those schemes each part alone does not reveal any useful information about the actual secret.

Here I see few different but compatible ideas aimed to push Bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) forward.
Idea 1: **treat bitcoins as a money** or even *the* money. For many it may be hard to achieve, but it is an important step. Before Bitcoin, most people knew only one form of money, and that form is still *the* money for them. Listen to what we speak and think about Bitcoin: "buy bitcoins with money", "sell bitcoins for money", "fund Bitcoin", "withdraw from Bitcoin", etc. It's hard to build closed-loop Bitcoin economy while we think in these terms. Instead, we should say and think: "buy dollars or euros with bitcoins", "sell dollars or euros for bitcoins", "get into fiat", "get out of fiat". Adopt this way of thinking and spread it. Use it in your posts and speech. When someone will hear you saying to your friend "I sold my dollars", it may make them think.
Idea 2: **minimize fiat usage**. Receive as bigger part of your income in Bitcoin as you can. Buy as many needed things and services with bitcoins as you can. It becomes feasible for more and more people as Bitcoin adoption grows. So do it if you can, or start doing it as soon as you can.
Idea 3: **motivate businesses by paying premium**. Or rather by being ready to pay premium. Bitcoin can cut costs in many cases, and we should pay less in these cases, not more. In other cases, however, Bitcoin does not give significant advantages yet, and that is where we could stimulate the adoption by paying more. I like this idea. Businessmen is the force that could solve some of the ongoing problems, and we need businessmen in the economy anyway. However, first we need to somehow motivate people to pay more. Few people who discuss the idea here will not make a market big enough for businesses to bother. So **please post ideas on how to motivate people to pay more**.

There are escrow services. They are rarely used in B2C, but I think, it will change. People start to care about their money after they lose it.

Current regulated system makes people careless in some aspects, which makes it difficult to switch to a free system. But more and more people start using cryptocurrencies, and that is one step to free economy. There are other important steps.

The exchange rate depends on value of *both* currencies. If you stabilize the value of bitcoin, a change in the value of USD will cause a corresponding change in the BTC/USD rate. If you peg BTC to USD, value of bitcoin will mirror value of dollar.
Bitcoin is deflational, its value is expected to go up in a long term. Dollar is inflational, its value is expected do down in a long therm. So, BTC/USD rate is not supposed to be stable. BTC/USD is an easy indicator, but we don't actually need the stability in its terms. What we need is *confidence* in value of bitcoin. If you work for bitcoins, you want to know how much you can buy with your salary. If you sell things for bitcoins, you need to make sure that inflow of bitcoins will cover all the expenses: salaries, supplies, taxes.
When businesses have to pay all their expenses in fiat, all they care about is the exchange rate. This will change when we will manage to build a closed-loop Bitcoin economy. When a business will pay most of its expenses in bitcoins and only use fiat for settlement with the state, the bitcoin/fiat exchange rate will be much less important. This is where most people will get the confidence in bitcoin value.

Meh, it does not say anything about type of malware.

I heard that in USSR the maximum penalty for using foreign currency was capital punishment.

Public may be pretty much brainwashed about money in general. I myself had a quite different idea about money before I discovered cryptocurrencies.

I ordered something from Bitcoin Store for really cheap. Not sure if they are going to deliver it, though.

Financial privacy, which is what many value Bitcoin for, is at greater risk than bitcoins themselves. I guess that matching surveillance data with block chain data can reveal details about most average user's transactions.

Maybe the site is slashdotted?

Nope. Bitcoin is like gold, and PayPal is like shit. However, Bitcoin economy is so undeveloped that even PayPal has some advantages over Bitcoin. One of these advantages is customer protection. But that advantage comes at a price: the seller is exposed to buyer fraud and other kinds of fraud.
Money in Bitcoin is "hard": if you received bitcoins, they are yours for sure (after confirmations and if the system is functioning properly, which is, however, not always the case). If refund is required, you have to send bitcoins back voluntary. If customer protection is needed, bitcoins should be stored in an escrow that can do dispute resolution.
BFL case is tricky, however. They cannot hold money in escrow, because they need it to fund the manufacture. Bitcoin does not fit this business model. Such enterprise should be funded by investors, who get a share of the company and can influence its operations. If you chose a company with the wrong business model and agreed to pay them upfront in Bitcoin, it means you are really trusting them. If then they cheat, it's your mistake to trust them.
