let me put it simply with an example, theres 2000 people per block that want to make a transaction and only 1000 can be accepted for every block whats the appropriate fee for all 2000 users per block?  So you have l33tcoin now and it doesnt mean transaction fees will rise it means altcoins will rise.

Not a good idea, lets hand over voting of blocksize to miners?! 
firstly they are just a tiny fraction of users, secondly they could potentially have the highest degree of bias toward blocksize regarding how it effects fees.
Miners alread pose the biggest threat via 51% attacks and now we want to hand them blocksize control also? 
If mining was a totally decentralised affair and every user was a miner it might make sense but thats far from the case.

Are we just waiting for the fun of it then? or can we implement a dynamic increase now please.
@_date: 2015-06-22 17:10:58
I dont think that was the main concern the main concern was bloat to the blockchain due to spam when the network was still young and it would have been cheap and easy to bloat the blockchain and put people off using Bitcoin at an early stage.
Id say just remove the limit and have an algo that rejects unusually high blocks based of previous blocksize data. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 14:46:17
Is Jan soon enough?
Still not entirely sure why adjusting blocksize based on previous data is not used? It would essentially have a hardlimit upperbound during any defined period of time but it would have the key attribute to accelerate if needed. If a bad actor tried to artificially increase blocksize it would take them time to do it and their effect would be limited because the adjustment will always be based from the average of all blocksizes during a period not just theirs.
Right now I dont really care though just implement any blocksize increase.
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:35:18
It shouldn't have been left until even 1 block is full. Don't know why we are waiting.

Bitcoin has all the attributes of cash but it is not the same as fiat cash, so the statement is not true unless there is other relevant context to it. 
The primary necessity of Bitcoin is that its a currency that doesn't devalue as a consequence of printing arbitrary amounts, having fiat cash in your hand is still subject to this devaluation or total crash in value so there may indeed be a necessity for the educated Greeks to obtain some bitcoin even if they already have cash in hand.

same things been happening for a few days now. We need a blocksize increase soon
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:57:46
Isnt this just remove the hard limit and let miners decide blocksize? 
We shouldnt give more power to miners, at any one time miners only represent a handful of users. This allows miners to restrict blocksize when a greater blocksize might be needed.
I still feel a simple algorithm that creates a new higher blocksize threshold based on historic block data. 
Bitcoin doesnt allow anyone to vote on diffculty or blockreward they adjust automatically and blocksize can equally. Why allow the forever ongoing input of biased decisions into the code when theres no need for it.

One thing that tends to be overlooked is that offchain services do not provide any security to the network when eventually the network will be running on fees rather than blockrewards. You will need hundreds of thousands of transactions fees to secure the network. If these transactions are all happening offchain you will begin to reach a dangerously low hashrate.
@_date: 2015-06-13 23:43:08
In the UK its hard to topup you cant buy without wire transfers.
If a service like coinbase would just auto top up for practically the same value as what you spend in btc then it would make spending btc far more attractive it would make it attractive even to people who are not interested in investing in bitcoin because they would benefit from the ease of paying for things with btc once it was setup. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:13:47
I think its fine to have bitcoin banks for the mass's. Its not the securing of my money at the bank that concerned me it was the type of money (fiat) I had in that bank that concerned me, if that type of money can be replaced by bitcoin but still secured by the same bank that's fine, there always remains the option to secure personally.
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:43:55
Because the primary need for Bitcoin is not some payment method or cheaper transactions its the currency itself as opposed to fiat. All these other things are just extras. Its a waste of time to try and sell Bitcoin based on these little almost insignificant benefits. 
Or to simplfy, Bitcoin was not created to challenge paypal or mastercard or any payment method it was created to challenge the pound, euro, dollar etc neither of which are payment methods.
You do realise that Bitcoin can fit within any current payment method or system that fiat currently uses.

Rising fees if blocksize isnt increased would be the perfect recipe for the rise of altcoins. 
There would be no reason to pay high fees when you can have the same functionality from altcoins with microfees. 
Bitcoin is not a fiat currency, it operates in a competing market which people overlook who believe fees could forever increase , no its not fees that would rise its altcoins that would rise.

I understand how congressmen can be put under pressure by peers or lobbyist to vote a certain way but then its also equally important that the public see they are voting in accordance with their promises.

Some of this raised money needs to start going into buying coin itself, rather than more infrastructure at this point infrastructure and surrounding services is outpacing btc price growth, there wont be enough volume of transactions for the surrounding companys to profit.
Contrary to popular beleif an increase price actually spurs spending as evidence previously with bitcoin as people feel more wealthy.
So with a 10 billion dollar cap potential merchant sales and total profits for surrounding bitcoins companys will be much less than if we had a 100 billion dollar cap.
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:01:52
I dont think you will ever see a single currency be dominate so once bitcoin reaches $5000 it will mix alot with other coins and online tokens etc which will also start to gain in popularity and take a market share.
This is all good as its a means of distributing wealth as alternative currencys slowly take over bitcoin will probably cap at about a million per btc at its height.

Its also nothing like a Ponzi Scheme, like it or not.

Yes inflation is a method to steal increases in production and productivity. It has to go somewhere though and that is typically interest earnt on newly created money and interlent between banks.
So most is consumed by the yearly profits of banks and other member corporations of the central banks.
Productivity increases is actually one of the primary unseen forces that has fueled and allowed a debt based system to continue for so long. Because increases in productivity are not small. Just take the advent of computing, huge amounts of new value enter into the economy but instead of translating into new prosperity ease and comfort, it can all be siphoned off via central banking. And so it is with all increases in productivity. Not to even mention the additional burden of interest and debt for each new unit as well as a devalued currency.

So because bitcoin is not currency in their eyes banks cannot provide service.... what a weak argument. 
What about a business that deals in rice or wheat thats not a currency do Chinese banks not provide services there also? 
The logic would be that banks can only provide services to others banks because they deal in currency's.
This is a ban without saying its a ban, otherwise they need to define bitcoin say as a commodity or property or whatever and they rephrase banks cannot provide serivces to bitcoin business because bitcoin is a commodity, oh wait err.
So whats really needed is to have them define what bitcoin is within their jurisdiction.

No Price follows users not security, otherwise we  could forever increase security which would automatically increase price? Of course not. You could make an altcoin and add extra security will it have a higher price? No, you could likewise make an altcoin and if you had the funding mine it to the same hashrate as bitcoin, would it have the same price, no it would simply be an over secure altcoin.  You need users because its people that are and provide ALL the value in any economy.

All this is is too much load for mtgox to handle. 
If they were more responsible they would close down new user applications untill they can handle and respond to their current users properly.
I dont beleive theres anything nefarious going on at mtgox its just a case of incompetence.

All genuine cryptocurrencys help support each other. What would be nice to see would be small exchanges opening for altcoins like doge and ltc where the coin can be directly purchased or sold with fiat. at the moment they are primarily reliant on BTC.
If the altcoins started to get their own exchanges it would strengthen all cryptocoins for there will be even more entry and exit points into fiat.

I beleive the password just encrypts your wallet.dat so if you have that saved and you remeber your password you can restore. You cannot restore with your password and your public address alone because the thing of value is the private key and your password was just encrypting that private key so the password on its own without the ecnrypted private key would be useless because the password is used to decrypt your private key so you always need that encrypted private key saved somewhere (the wallet.dat)
Alternative just print out your private key on paper so if your harddrive crashes or your backup is corrupt you have a paper backup and if your scared of someone finding your paper backup you could do your own bit a simple encryption to it that you can remember such as changing all a's into b's for example.

You own the bitcoins you control meaning only you can reassign them to another public address.
Its similar to property ownership all that property ownership is is your name on the land register deed and to transfer ownership is simply to change the name on the deed.
Likewise if you ever want to change ownership of a bitcoin you reassign it to another public address where that person will them assume control over it.
All that ownership is then is a collective agreement, everyone agrees so and so has ownership of this house at this address using the ledger of the land registry to have consensus. Or whatever tool it is that leads a group of people to agree on ownership of a "thing" the tool in bitcoin is the ledger of the blockchain.
In reality there is no such thing as ownership, it is just a fiction another game that humanity plays.
If for example the collective fiction of property ownership broke down and it was no longer agreeded on then property would not be owned other than by a single persons claim to ownership which they would then need to defend because there would be no agreement.

Im willing to experiment anyway, its hard to actually work out if mining shares are profitable or not with so many variables.
One thing I dont understand about PETA is they have running costs of a static 72BTC per week and a loan also priced in BTC's, but running costs and loans are not paid with bitcoins and the running cost and loan amount should drop or rise in accordance with the bitcoin price which it does not.
So if bitcoin prices rise and their running costs stay at 72 and their btc loan amount does not shrink it will not be profitable it cant be.
Is there anyway you can get more details on their running costs and their long term reinvestment plans.

Its a bit of a catch 22 because I support bitcoin simply for what it can do for the world economy and yet if I was to believe it would not rise in value then it would also not have that impact on the economy I believe in.

I agree with rrssh you can, because there are all sorts of arguments and laws that begin to conflict with each other that can render current laws unreasonable or unlawful. For example the government itself on paper is an entity created by the people in order to serve the people, no one can argue it can be anything else otherwise it wouldnt exist you could never say in reasonableness that government was created to be a burden, it has to be the will of the people.
Therefore if all the people are doing somthing that very act implys that it is already the will of the people and if a law claims otherwise the law is demonstrated to be unlawful by the facts and thus in need of repeal. Either that or you conclude the government is acting outside its mandate more like a private entity and thus has no authority apart from a claimed authority which is a bluff.

I mean you can buy multiple terabyte capacity on just consumer grade harddrives im not sure this is actually a big a problem as it seems, if a problem at all.

Can you not simulate what the fees will be by modeling it against total visa transactions and total money supply that runs over visa then deduce that if this was the same volume over bitcoin what would the value of a fee be if matched to the current value of a bitcoin fee.

This is clealry bitcoin positive not to say that they will not try to rig that also. 
I find it unreal that governments and institutions in todays world can get away with blatantly setting financial traps for the public, for thats what it is. They are literally telling to the peoples face we are going to set a trap for you, we are not going to allow you to move your money and then we are going to debase that money massively as well as tax it whilst making it illegal for you to do anything about it.
Governments were only ever established by the people to be a benefit else why would we create them when they are not benefit us they need to be changed or if they wish to stand in the way of the momentum of the force of life itself they will inevitably been blown apart.
If Europe wants to succeed it should sober itself up see the money system is utterly flawed and will always result in unsustainable debt and make the radical but intelligent decision that it need to embrace entirely new forms of money and have member states accept this new money as payment of tax.

That pretty much explains the 33% unknown. 
Is it possible for bitcoin to change its SHA-256 crytographic function? 
People say that miners hold the vote but thats completely incorrect, the value of bitcoin comes from its users the same way the value of fiat comes from its users and so the vote with bitcoin is totaly with what its users decide, not the miners, nor the bitcoin foundation. If everyone votes to use fork with a different crytographic function then thats the coin that will be traded and have value, obviously its better to just stick to how it is but 
If KNC get any bigger this may have to happen, there wont even be a choice, unless people are happy with the potential of a 51% attack being ever present. Not to mention the fact this is not helping the distribution of bitcoin at all, far better if all those machines where in the hands of thousands of people.

Even if bitcoin was totally and utterly banned it would still grow in value just slower than it could if it was not. The first few bitcoin transactions had no dollar value they were just valued by its users. 
I would predict that if there was an outright ban world wide, all exchanges shut. The price of bitcoin would probably hit about $10 and simply be used as trade between its users but from that point alone it will grow with nothing whatever that could stand in its way. 
You understand this when you understand the source of all value of currencys is its users and bitcoin has already hit a critical mass of users that garuntees a value to bitcoin regardless of fiat exchange. 
$10 is just a guess it could be much higher but there is a core value that is absolutely locked in now bitcoin right now has a minimum value which is always and constantly steadily growing.

Sell hashing at a higher price? It rarely happens, most of the time the bitcoins you earn through mining is not enough to offset the loss in value of the ghs when its sold. 
However checking the ghs price to btc somthing odd has happened since about april 28th where ghs price has kept a steady pace. This is actually nonsensical as it should always go down pretty much in line with difficulty increase. Because its not that would explain the current popularity of ghash.io because since april 28th you have been able to buy ghs mine and then sell later for pretty much the price you bought at + bitcoins mined in the mean time. However the price is clearly overbought probably because of newbies wanting to mine quick and easy new users to ghash just buying at inflated prices simply because they want to get started. Would be interesting to see ghash.io data on new users since about april 28th.
I would expect a massive sell in ghs is coming because diffculty or hashing rate has not been steady since april 28th but price of ghs has....??!

And theres some 170,000 tonnes of gold which makes a shitload of ounces  5996580000 if those calculations are right and that supply of ounces is already at a higher value than bitcoin with only 21 million supply, then this is why its far more likley you will see a million dollar bitcoin than it is a million dollar ounce of gold in fact its probably impossible to see a million dollar ounce of gold. 
I think its roughly 2% of golds value going into bitcoin would achieve a bitcoin price of $10,000

Its backed by the same thing the dollar is backed by and that is the time and energy of its users.
If I rip up worthless bits of paper sign each bit then  promise you I will wash your car once a week and I will accept one bit of this paper as payment, then a week comes round and sure enough I accept it are you going to throw the rest away or maybe keep them safe in the draw because now they suddenly have a perceived value because I give it its value through my acceptance of it via my time and energy. This is what the dollar is backed by and its whats bitcoin is backed by its the same.
So in a sense these worthless bitcoins have value simply because we collectively agree they do and we the userbase have all the economic value through our time and energy in the services and goods WE produce we simply agree that bitcoin is the means of exchange of this value not the value itself. Likewise the dollar is deriving its value from excatly the same place namley its users.

the value of a currency is derived from its users. All currencys are therefore backed by its users.
Governments know this which is why they use fiat currencys, fiat being the decree normally in the form of legal tender and tax laws that demand the users remain users and that they can only settle their tax's with it.
This doesnt mean people cannot become users of their own currencys through freewill choice rather then compelled by force.
So backed by the government simply means the government maintains artificial demand for the currency through peoples necessity to pay tax with it.
This is what you might call a force based currency because its users are compelled. Bitcoin is a non force based currency because its not backed by any entity forcing you to use it.

Its not so much that bitcoin solves poverty but its the removing of fiat that solves poverty and bitcoin potentially allows you to do that.
Our current money system is insidious, way beyond what many people are aware although more are now.
3 major causes of poverty through out money system.
1. Its a zero sum game, because money is debt in order for someone to become "rich" someone else must by necessity of the money system become equally poor or indebted, because any net worth anyone has has to represent someone elses debt. 
2. Interest based, every unit is issued at interest sucking in peoples value from the economy to simply pay the interest on the form of money they use. This is primarily recognised in the form of bank/financial profits.
3. Inflationary, Because of the ever increasing need for supply due to its debt based nature and centralised arbitrary control on increasing supply for central profits we see the money supply increasing at rapid rate further sucking out value from people by diluting the value of the current money supply.
You add these three points up and in my my opinion you dont just have a poor money system you have the absolute worst, it is brilliant in a sense in its ability to impoverish.
And so Bitcoin if used as a primary currency solves poverty not so much because of its unique qualitys but simply because it overcomes the three issues mentioned above.

"This flaw allowed Gavin to assume that Bitcoin miners would always receive a return on their investments, because the price of their services—in this case, confirming transactions—would never fall below production costs."
Firstly Gavin didnt say this but the author has assumed it and we can infer believes this it to be necessary that miners have a return on their investment.
Bitcoin has no concern about investment it is irrelevant and so the price of providing mining at any one time can fall below the price of their service there was never any agreement neither could there be that bitcoin would always provide a profit to miners and that is precisely why there is difficulty built into the system a very important factor that is completely absent from that article and which would render any economic theory void when applied to mining because difficulty is like a lever that directly effects supply and demand of mining power so that they are always in balance regardless of profits or loss's in the world of economics.
Theortically you could have just a handful of people processing all transactions and taking all fees at at a very low difficulty there will always be someone to take those fees. The real question is what level of hashing power is considered secure and how low could it go before its considered unsecure.

Wrong, miners dont call the shots neither do the devs, the users do and if some change is required and a forks happen whatever fork most users chose to use will be the one that gets used.
You could have majority of miners stick with one fork because its better for their profits for example but if the majority of users chose a more stable fork then those miners will switch in a flash.
Id say the biggest vote would actually come from service providers such as bitpay coinbase blockchain etc simply because they indirectly control the vote of their users of course if they got it wrong their users would leave in droves, or the users would simply become inactive on their service until they got on the right fork so even there you couldnt really say the service provider had the choice it was the users.

The value is derived from the same place the pound or the dollar derives its value, which also has no physical properties. And that place is the time and energy of its users for this is the source of all value within the economy. Remember a currency is not the thing of value its the agreed upon means to transfer value.   
Example. If you have an employee and he rips up bits of worthless paper signs each bit gives them to you and tells you he will accept each bit as payment per month and sure enough he does accept, well then suddenly what was worthless paper now has worth to you. This is all any currency is accept instead of pieces of paper you use something with all the desirable properties.

Anything you can do with current fiat money can be done with bitcoin, anything. You could have bitcoin physical cash, you could have chargeback services, you could have deposit insurance etc these are just additional services or layers that can be created if theres a demand.
Pounds or Dollars do not inherently have these services they are just neutral units of exchange as bitcoin are. The services are provided by service providers typicaly via contractual agreements between participating parties. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:17:05
No it doesn't, bitcoin can maintain itself on a steady number of users. The price would not rise if users did not increase but it would not crash either which is the point. In a ponzi if you have no new users it crashes because it demands new users, in bitcoin if you have no new users it simply maintains price and the current users have their own mini economy. Bitcoins are not issued at interest.
You could argue there is a small inflationary factor in bitcoin of a few percent per year so userbase would at least have to match that to maintain price but its small and simply a function of distributing bitcoins and providing a network until cap is hit.

@_date: 2014-08-07 20:34:19
on another note.
Is it possible to have a QR code that can contain all the information needed for a bitcoin wallet to take a specific amount in payment from.
So If I enter in 0.023 BTC and request payment I could just scan this QR code and its done.
So there would be no requirement from the user of anything, no use of electronics or need to enter password all information that the wallet required could be retrieved from the QR code.
Obviously this would have zero security but neither does cash, you could load it with however much you safe doing each day and just carry it around on a piece of plastic or whatever for payments.
It might be possible with updates made to wallets.

Interesting how they distinguish fiat currency and virtual currency by pointing out the fact that a fiat currency represents a claim for a redeemable against the issuer.
And yet I am pretty sure you cannot redeem your fiat currency for anything, has anyone tried? If I go into the bank of England with a £20 receipt note they will simply redeem it for another £20 not 20 pounds in weight of silver. 
With regards to them saying bitcoin exchanges may need to be regulated by AML regulations well im pretty sure all the major exchanges that operate in Europe already do that anyway.

And the most important thing to become decentralised is government and regulation.
Democracy in ancient Greece only used centralised government and representatives because there was no practical means of allowing everyone to submit proposals and for everyone to individually vote on those proposals. 
But today primarily because of technology we do indeed have the means to do that and so should begin to evolve our governments to utitlise that means.

dollar backed altcoin, they obviously dont get it. "Realcoin" people still dont get where the value of a currency comes from, its users, the time and energy of those accepting it. This is where the dollar gets its value from and its also where bitcoin gets its value from. The diffrence is the userbase of bitcoin is increasing and the userbase of dollars is decreasing. 
But this could be good as it may allow for another method of exchange of bitcoin to fiat.

Well that is how bitcoin works they come from zero.
As stated in the IRS guidelines 
"A taxpayer generally realizes capital gain or loss on the sale or exchange of virtual currency that is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer"
Well according to that statement then your gain is when you sell the bitcoin so if you instantly sell then you go from 0 to $1000 as a gain. I understand what your saying that a gain has to be ontop of a current value. But the phenomena of bitcoin is that it does indeed come from zero, so maybe this could be a point of argument that a gain cannot be taxed until the value rises above its date of creation value, but I doubt they will accept it.
You could include the cost of mining and add the bitcoin value ontop of that as the gain.

pick up anywhere is in relation to receiving payments of bitcoin from others not buying bitcoin. In which case its no different from receiving an email and once you have your wallet you can pickup(receive) anywhere you have a computer or your phone with you.
The point is for people using bitcoin as a currency between them the transfer of money is no more difficult than emailing. 
If you want to buy some bitcoin you can from coinbase or other places online or you could mine some if you want to buy a miner. So once you have bought some bitcoin anyone else you know anywhere in the world that also accepts bitcoin you can then send any amount for free anytime to them.
@_date: 2014-02-23 14:23:11
Bitcoin is not a consumer tool or service its a currency, it is neutral. 
As a consumer then some advantages are bitcoin requires no third party service to do a transaction and thus those fees can be removed.
With pounds or dollar or whatever you always need a third party to do an online transaction.
Purchasing goods and services internationally is also frictionless no currency conversion needed. 
So example is im in the UK purchasing somthing from the US if they dont accept BTC then I have to pay conversion fees plus the payment service provider fee, the mechant will also have wait times and likley their own fees to pay. If they accept bitcoin I send payment in bitcoin instantly at no fee.
Another benefit for a merchant is that the acceptance of bitcoin is free. Anyone can start accepting bitcoins immediately with no cost and open themselves up to a new customer base with little effort.
These mentioned benefits however are insignificant in comparison with bitcoins potential impact on the worlds economy and dont interest me that much.

You would have to work out what would be a minimum hash rate to secure the network in order to determine what the minimum fee would be. So if you take the percentage of profit earned by miners in fees as a percentage of total profit that would be roughly the equivalent percentage in hashrate you would have from current total hashrate if we were currently running on just fees.
Satoshi must have been betting on transaction volume vastly increasing over the years in order to pay for securing the network.
At present fees could probably double or triple without being to much of an issue but would that be enough on its own without block reward to secure the network?
*The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is
less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation

I dont beleive so. In the end for bitcoin to reach mass adoption there will need to be organisations in the future that take on security and general responsibility for them.
The general population is not responsible and doesn't want to be. Its no good arguing with it for its a fact and so certain sectors of the bitcoin economy will have to provide for this need in order to reach mass adoption.
So we should approach this from what is the best way to achieve this, insurance would be one option but its too expensive at present to be truely viable.

I dont quite follow why answering those questions would make a point when the point was that features or attributes is not what gives BTC its price. 
Q1. If the question is what would cause a price increase? then yes indeed wait for users to grow and price will follow.
Q2. Why would realising that all currencys value is backed by the time and energy of its users be a case for a fragile price? ALL currencys are dependant on its users. If you feel there is some technical fault or a new technology that will cause a rapid drop in users of bitcoin then you might say its fragile but I dont see that no. I see the current users of bitcoin to be the most loyal and brillant userbase of any currency yet, therefore very strong at its core, also I see the userbase of bitcoin increasing, theres literally no reason I can find myself why it would decrease.

its not manipulation its just supply and demand. It is good news that Microsoft and Time accept Bitcoin but its also true that this increases supply on exchanges for they are not actually accepting Bitcoin they are accepting fiat but utilizing bitcoins payment mechanism.
So we have supply from merchants selling bitcoin and we have supply from miners and its outstripping demand.
We need decentralised mining, someone please develop a fanless/silent miner that can plug into home routers with no technical knowledge required just a plug and play miner sold at retail.
As far as merchant adoption goes eventually a critcal mass of acceptance will happen where Bitcoin suddenly shifts from simply being seen as a payment mechanism to being seen also as a currency and then the need to convert will be vastly reduced this will likley be on a timescale that will coincide with a halving of the block reward.
In the mean time we just need usecases developed that can increase demand.

Open source paywall for content or a service provided paywall maybe somthing that could work similar to changetip for unlocking content on established platforms like youtube etc.
Not sure if this is possible but a decentralised youtube site maybe utilising similar technology of  for hosting the videos with a bitcoin paywall built into the platform so certain content can be charged for if the uploader choses, no need to get rid of ad revenue either because ad revenue can become the revenue of all users of the platform.

Article 1, Section 8, Clause 5 of the Constitution  this also makes all bank credit illegal as well because it wasn't coined by the us treasury. The way they sidestepped this in the past was to say coined means physical cash and therefore the private federal reserve creating money is not "coining" and so is not in breach.

Nothing, but the probability of a double spend attempt would be very low and even then its chance of being successful is low.
If enough people were using bitcoin you would probably find the attempts at double spending would be similar to current credit card fraud which is considered negligible by merchants(about 0.1%), on top of that there would be no fees and also no chance of chargeback so in total its certainly not a game breaker for merchants to accept 0 confirmation transactions and would still likely translate into greater profits than credit cards.

Normally you cannot sell hashing back at the same or higher price It rarely happens, most of the time the bitcoins you earn through buying ghs is not enough to offset the loss in value of the ghs when its sold.
However checking the ghs price to btc somthing odd has happened since about April 28th where ghs price has kept a steady pace. This is actually nonsensical as it should always go down pretty much in line with difficulty increase and hash rate increase. Because its not that would explain the current popularity of ghash.io because since about April 28th you have been able to buy ghs, mine and then sell later for pretty much the price you bought at + bitcoins mined in the mean time. However the price is clearly overbought probably because of newbies wanting to mine quick and new users to ghash just buying at inflated prices simply because they want to get started. Would be interesting to see ghash.io data on new user signups since about April 28th.
I would expect a massive sell in ghs is coming because difficulty or hashing rate has not been steady since April 28th but price of ghs has....??!

Im totally happy with the situation where merchants convert into fiat, I never foresaw that but its this mechanism that will allow rapid adoption, for any merchant can accept at literally no cost and open themselves up to new customers.
Now of course we know that ultimaltey we want people accepting bitcoin not accepting bitcoin as means to be paid in fiat but as adoption increases suddenly merchants will realise that where they spend there expenses also accept bitcoin and so they will be willing to hold revenue in bitcoin to pay their expenses directly in bitcoin and this effect could quickly snowball but in order to get to that stage you need the situation we have now where people accept only to convert into fiat so its just a phase that bitcoin needs to get through.

not really because saying this cost 4,345,120 or whatever bits is long winded. Thats the entire reason you have ubits.
If the smallest denomination hadnt already been taken by "satoshi" then "bits" would of been a good name there. 
Mbits are fine right now for calculating the majority of purchases from big to large and will be for a good while and once the price increases 100x then we can start pricing in ubits.
So you will never need any other denomination than mbits and ubits, they cover the whole range.

Off blockchain is nothing more than a private agreement. 
Say you hold 2 bitcoins for your sister and 2 bitcoins for your brother and your brother wants to sell 1 bitcoin and your sister wants to buy it, you just change your own private account to reflect that and bitcoins have changed hands and the blockchain was not involved it was off chain.
You cant make someone in a private agreement show that in public unless they wish to. So what needs to be understood then is that blockchain statistics is not a full and fair reflection of the entire activity within bitcoin.
coinbase and others could release data if they chose that say this many transactions and this much volume happened off chain during this period.

A corporate crypto currency might work but only on a small scale. 
A corporation is going to create a cryptocurrency but they are going to be the issuing and controlling authority over it, immediately nullifying the primary benefits which makes bitcoin attractive.
They are more likley to just expand the concept of vouchers/coupons related to their products and serivces into exchangeable units between their users. Which is all good let them do that but it wont be close to what Bitcoin is and certainly wont be a threat.
If they actually wanted to start a real crypto currency they could make an altcoin put their name on it officaly back it and become buyers. A corporation likley wont do this but it wouldnt be such a bad idea because it would provide lots of free publicity.

No because the price of bitcoin is more or less irrelevant to ghs/btc because both of their values are based on the price of bitcoins.
For example if the price of bitcoin drops so does the price of the bitcoins your earning through the mining of your ghs so likewise the price of the ghs drops in line or rise's in line if price of bitcoins goes up.

Price is 100% dependent on users. An increase in security or transaction volume will have zero effect on price.
However it will have an effect on price because of the increase in users because of the increase in security and transaction volume but of course it was not these things themselves that added the value it was the users. 
This is why those arguments that say its math, and the blockchain technology and the miners that give bitcoin its value are utter nonsense, else you could duplicate the code and it should have the same value because it posses the same attributes that supposedly "give it" its value but of course if you just duplicated bitcoin you have no users and thus no value.
All value for all currencys including gold comes from the time and energy of the users of that currency, more users more value simple.

You dont need to boycott it you just need to let people realise the ghs price is too high. 
People are making "free money" so to speak since roughly 28th April because they can buy ghs earn bitcoins and sell that ghs at roughly the same price later on plus the bitcoin they have earnt. If they can continue to do that you think they will leave? No, This is a bubble and it can continue for as long as people pile money into it and keep that ghs price stable or higher overtime, just like a ponzi. 
They are probably then telling others that join in and also keep the ghs price inflated.
I beleive this is exactly whats happening and theres a slight frenzy around people telling each other and buying into it, either that or ghash.io are manipulating the price of ghs. I made a post here about it.

A website for crowd funding peoples morgage would be good, but it needs to be done legitamte with legally binding contracts and the creditors will be entitled to foreclose on the property if you fail to pay same as with banks.
The creditor would have to be the company running the website but it in turn would have a contract with the users of the website.
It would actually be a very secure way for people to invest and get a steady 4-5% return because even if the debtor fails his obligation there is collateral to settle it in the form of the property itself. The only potential loss is if the property price dropped and the user failed to pay. But even that can be offset by using methods that zopa employ to garuntee a return.
And of course people can finally get their morgage with out all the rediclous credit checks. 
The model is already in place with sites like zopa and fundingcircle just needs to be expanded to morgages.

Then sure enough next week comes I wash your car and to your suprise I actually do accept one of these bits of paper are you now going to throw the rest away? No because just like magic all of a sudden those worthless bits of paper have a certain value simply through one persons pledge to accept them as payment. Because the true source of value within the economy is peoples time and energy. 
Now of course no one is going to accept bits of paper but bits of something else that can act perfectly as a medium of exchange a person might accept and then another and then another and each time the value goes up.

No, theres no such thing as ending QE, QE is just the normal functioning of central banks. QE is all they do and is all they have ever done and is all they ever will do. Its just a bullshit word they gave to the mass's and that made it sound like a one off event.
Charlie Bean, Deputy governor of the bank of England confirmed this in a Q&amp;A, quote.
"Central banks routinely buy and sell government debt in the secondary market as part of their normal operations in the money markets and such operations are not deemed to amount to monetary financing under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The only thing that distinguishes quantitative easing from normal operations is their scale and the length of time for which the assets are likely to be held"

All bitcoin wallets are the same, if you start an account with some service provider like blockchain or coinbase you will have an associated wallet with your account.
Blockchain and coinbase are different types of services.
If you want to buy bitcoin then coinbase should be fine. Coinbase act as a type of bitcoin bank so you are putting trust into them to secure you bitcoins, blockchain is a service that allows you to host your own wallet online without having to trust them hence why they wont sell you bitcoins directly. 
If you are novice then coinbase or circle or the bank style services are the best bet to start with.
It cant be diffcult because the process with these companys is no diffrent from any other retail website you create an account then you enter your card details to buy thats all.

Not really money is a unit representing your energy and so its nonsensical to say a basic income is a right, for every right which is not a natural innate right will carry an obligation on others and no one has a right to your energy beyond your choice.
And so it would be equally correct to reverse the statement and say it should be an obligation for you to provide your energy to others.... Meaning you would lose your right to the fruit of your own labor in order to provide others with the right to a basic income regardless of your choice in the matter.
What needs to be honored is freewill, if someone choses individually to provide others with a basic income then that is perfectly valid but that would not be a right.

Been thinking this for a while.
Just take a game like guild wars 2 for example, they could easily implement bitcoin wallet addresses into each user account so in game characters have a bitcoin address.
Their ingame store which is their source of income would then have frictionless payment and because its so easy and fast payments would surley increase.
Furthermore possiblityts of implementing bitcoin rewards for the first guild to drop a boss or even small rewards just scattered about as drops.
A guy was talking ingame the other day that he would command 24/7 for a wage which although sounds pretty lame and I wouldnt recommend anyone do that will likley become more of a reality in the future and bitcoin would make it easily possible for players to pay each other.
Bottomline is theres going to be an mmo that does this sooner or later.

I dont entirely understand the thinking of selling your coins at a discount because you think gox is insolvent.
By selling you guarantee a 75% loss if they resume withdrawals or nothing at all if they go bankrupt
By buying you guarantee a 75% gain if they resume withdrawals or nothing at all if they go bankrupt
So it must be you either think that gox are not insolvent and you can do a fiat withdrawal, but if their not insolvent then they have the bitcoins. Or you think its better to sue over fiat loss than bitcoin loss, but you dont get blood from a stone.

Bitcoin is  and was designed to be a currency thats not just a side effect of it. 
Dont worry about convincing people it doesn't come across well and there is no need to do it, Bitcoin is totally sound it will prove itself. 
The psychology of trying to convince people is that the person themselves are not sure in their own beliefs which makes up their sense of self and so they want to find others to agree or convert so they can feel safe and content in their belief and understanding.
Most commonly seen in political and religious folks trying to convert others. Therefore if people dont like Bitcoin let them not like it.

Chargeable gains - Corporation Tax and Capital Gains Tax: If a profit or loss on a currency contract is not within trading profits or otherwise within the loan relationship rules, it would normally be taxable as a chargeable gain or allowable as a loss for Corporation Tax or Capital Gains Tax purposes. Gains and losses incurred on Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are chargeable or allowable for Capital Gains Tax if they accrue to an individual or, for Corporation Tax on chargeable gains if they accrue to a company.

Their reasoning for high fees are based on cost of mining at current difficulty if there where no block rewards.....
Satoshi did not make difficulty a static variable or one that cannot drop... 
So the basis for all their reasoning for high fees is off, as block rewards petas off difficulty will adjust it will drop if necessary. 
Its the users that will ultimately set the fee in terms of what they are willing to pay not miners, if a miner sets his fee too high he will be using electricity whilst not earning any fees whilst another miner will be willing to pickup the fees people are actually choosing to pay, the miner charging too high a fee goes offline eventually as hes not making a profit. 
Diffculty will thus self adjust because this is open market and the profit of miners will always stay within a sustainable range for if profit increases too much there will always be someone else willing to take a smaller cut. 
The fees probably are low currently and will increase but that does not mean they will increase indefinitely out of reach of most users they will simply find price discovery which will be the reasonable amount the majority is willing to pay, put another way its perfect as it is and uncontrollable fees will not be an issue. What they should be focusing on is DDOS prevention and scaling of the blockchain.

If bitcoin is being used as the sole currency then its near free to transfer money internationally regardless of amount. So the bitcoin advocates are right. When your looking to transfer fiat which is what your asking neither party is actually accepting or using bitcoin are they? So its not actually being used as a cuurency here but even still it is possible simply to use it as a means if transfer by exchanging on either end however this will entail usual cost that the fiat banking world apply.  Therefore start using bitcoin as an actual currency between you and your parterners and there will be zero restrictions and fees between you.

You also factor in the advancement of computer technology and any possible optimisations of bitcoin.
There maybe a way to create a client that can decentralise the blockchain storage across many users. 
This is a FUDdy thread but im upvoting anyway because the calculations are about right and its worth creating the solutions now rather than later. 
Furthermore off-blockchain transactions will grow and are growing and they may even become the primary means of transactions. Wallet services providers could begin to work with eachother so that users of each service can transact with each other off-chain. So the coinbase model will be the more popular over the blockchain.info for example.

The point in tipping is to show appreciation for some value you have received and return some, therefore if you are tipping 100bits you are not returning any value so what exactly is the purpose of that tip? Its apparent to the person being tipped that you are making it about the tipping itself rather than the content or appreciation for the person being tipped.
Therefore do not tip unless its genuinely for the sake of wanting to give some value.

because its technically inflationary. Its supply increases.
to accommodate greater money supply it does not rely on this inflationary mechanism of mining instead it simply adds 0's to the end rather than 1's to the front. 
The inflationary / deflationary debate is actually complete nonsense for bitcoin because its essentially neither. The small inflationary effect from mining was not in order to create an inflationary currency instead it was a mere requirement to produce the network for bitcoin to operate on by giving this reward of inflation to those providing the network and also to help distribute bitcoins. Theoretically if there was already a prepaid network for bitcoin to run on and thoese bitcoins were already well distributed it could work just fine with a 21 million static money supply.
Right now theres adequate supply, essentially quad trillions of  -&gt; bits of coins &lt;-. If the goods and services flowing through it required it. The limited amount argument therefore is simply lack of understanding. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:49:38
In that scenario the biggest pool quickly becomes the smallest pool because other miners will undercut them and no transactions will get hashed on their pool. 
So in a sense its still the user that dictates the fee because the majority of users will set an average fee they are willing to pay and miners will match it.

The assumption by the bank is that the card is stolen hence using the signature as reason not to pay you back. 
But you dont know if it was stolen it could just be the customer purchasing so you want to request more information from them regarding if they were aware the card was stolen and what they had done about it and why you have now sustained a loss because they took no action over a stolen card.
If the card is not stolen then the signature is irrelevant because the cardholder is then verified as doing the purchase and so they must proven that they did not receive what they purchased.

By fractionalising it you would accept a minor loss if it accured so if one user decided to reverse a payment after receiving BTC in the example I gave you would lose £5 and they would have their bank details banned from the exchange. After sometime you would have many highly rated users.
Also charge-backs are not a free-ride, if you do a chargeback your liable to be sued if there is clear evidence you received what you paid for which there will be.
Infact im thinking ignore the wiretransfer entirely and do soley debit card purchases but fractionalised. it would take some skillful programming to match the buyers and sellers in realtime, you wouldnt beable to set specific price but you could "join a price" like join a sell price @ $1010 with currently 15/20 sellers 75% funded" and the same on the buy side. And then there would just be market price where the engine would just group buyers and sellers @ current price. The more users the more fractionalised you could make it, reducing risk further. 
In microfinacing companys such as zopa or fundingcircle the loss rate is roughly 1-2% the same could be extrpolated here which is not far off what a fee would be anyway for the sake of a decentralised exchange.

In a sense an address never gets "used", because it can just be generated again randomly by chance and used again accept the likleyness of this happening is practically zero. So an address considered used can only be an address with an actual amount of bitcoins in it and you cannot fill all the address's with all the satoshis available by even a fraction.
If an address was considered used then 2^160 would have to slowly shrink in size over a very long period of time but it doesnt it stays at 2^160 because address's dont get used.

I think its mining which is causing the price drop, although the amount of coins mined is only small in comparison to total cap it is still large in terms of daily trading volume and the way mining has gone which is unfortunate has centralised it into profit making business's rather than distributed to millions of people all mining a bit. So they just sell and make their regular bit of fiat profit weekly they have no love or interest in bitcoin and could be just a case of the killing the goose that laid the golden egg. 
The reward drop is still long way off too :(
The idea is good about debiting connected accounts and yes theres no reason it cannot be done. Anything you can do with the banking system could theoretically be done with bitcoin its all just layers.

Bitcoin is not income if its not a currency. 
Miners will remain unaffected, because no miner is going to declare the market value of any bitcoin it mines. This is just more classic case of the emperor with no cloths. Its just a claim and nothing more and theres no means by which the IRS can enforce it. 
Bitcoin does not sit within the jurisdiction of any government or country, but your strawmnan sits within the jurisdiction of the IRS by your tacit acquiescence. Because of this no government defines bitcoin but it can define bitcoin within its own jurisdiction to thoses that have contractual obligations with it and who are having thier own collective fanatasy with that fictional entity.

The question was what do you need from us so the answers where all a bit a tame because if you are being asked what if anything could the government do then I would say well ultimatley you classify bitcoin as a currency make it an additional currency to be added to legal tender and have the government accept it as payment for tax and then equally use its bitcoin revenue for expenses whilst experimenting with the blockchain to allow the public to see for the first time in history exactly where those expenses where spent.

Its just a necessary phase that bitcoin is going to have to get through. Being practically realistic you cannot expect business to hold bitcoin at this current time because all their business expenses are in fiat. So yes its true they are not actually accepting bitcoin they are accepting fiat via the bitcoin payment system.
I still think this is positive though because it boosts merchant adoption by magnitudes more than it would if they couldn't receive fiat and so ultiamtley brings about the type of environment that will be required for bitcoin to actually start being used as a major currency.
Eventually merchants will discover that some of their business expenses are also accepting bitcoin be they employees, suppliers whatever especially international payments where they start to recognise they may as well hold a portion of their bitcoins to save money on these expenses. 
Your idea is a fine one btw im sure that could easily be implemented.

A change in receipt address in memory can be done to any transaction, so you could change an IBAN input just as you could change a public key.
Or any transaction with a recipient address field could potentially be changed.
Therefore the solution to this type of maleware is not bitcoin specific. To assume that you would not fix it because of this is idiocy.
So it is not a flaw with bitcoin is it? its a global vulnerability on all computer system, how are you going to fix it via the bitcoin protocol? you cant you have to fix it by a change to the computer system itself.

Well technically you can launder money with prepaid cards there is a secondary market for them in which you can get paid fiat. So either the whole proposal should be scrapped or prepaid cards should be included.
Walmart provides the definition for a prepaid card
"Gift certificate" shall mean a written promise or electronic payment device that: (i) is usable at a single merchant or an affiliated
group of merchants that share the same name, mark, or logo, or is usable at multiple, unaffiliated merchants or service
providers; and (ii) is issued in a specified amount; and (iii) may or may not be increased in value or reloaded; and (iv) is
purchased and/or loaded on a prepaid basis for the future purchase or delivery of any goods or services; and (v) is honored
upon presentation.

Three points.
1. As someone else mentioned impatience people who where waiting for another bubble have cashed out.
2. Constant selling pressure from coinbase and bitpay merchants as well as mining companys which is out pacing adoption. However as price drops this point will find equilibrium because individuals can buy more substantial amounts of bitcoins at a lower price.
3. Complacency with current financial system, QE going as intended, stock market slowly rising in value from funny money, no banking crisis, no plundering of bank accounts etc etc so basicly no major intensive for people to seek alternatives in this environment. Blissful ignorance is currently a winner.

So theres exaggerted selling on other exchanges and exaggerated buying on gox because of the problems with gox once again therefore the real price is really a median of both. But then again I would say these problems with Gox are causing a general suppression in price and it needs to be resovled either by Gox or by users moving away from gox.
The good thing is volume on gox is slowly dropping as people migrate away hopefully dispersing use more evenly amongst other exchanges.

Once productions cost of mining chips hits rock bottom and it becomes all about energy cost a device that could just plug directly into peoples home routers and run without the computer might be popular.
Even if people know they are not going to make a profit or maybe even run ar a small loss it might still be popular just for the hobbiest or people interested or just people who are keen in decentralising mining for if hundreds of thousands where to do this and run 24/7 miner through their router even if it was at a small loss it would wreck havok on the big miners as they in turn cannot afford to run at a loss on energy costs.

No, bitcoin address are randomly generated, the only way an identity can be traced to a bitcoin address is when using services such as circle, coinbase or exchanges that keep a record of your identity and associate it with an accounts bitcoin address.
But just generating an address and receiving a transaction has no identity attached or any information attached at all, not even an ip address. 
The blockchain will show you the chain of transactions to and from that address.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:40:48
I dont see what the big concern is here the risk is actually with them, because bitcoin transactions are non refundable whereas creditcards can be reversed which is why this service isn't available anywhere namley the ability to buy bitcoins directly like any other product using a card.
This is likley why the premium is high to cover chargeback risks.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:40:33
Remember also even if blockchain.info ever went offline for good  it doesnt effect your bitcoins you can still retrieve them through your wallet backup.
Which is why blockchain have a good model. would be nice if they could start offering some type of exchange functionality maybe similar to bittylicious.
This way you would never have a bitcoin withdrawal issue or any concernes that bitcoins are not accounted for because all bitcoins would be held by users in their personal wallets. The service provider would hold the bitcoins in escrow during the trade itself.

The banks hold a massive privilege, namley the ability to create credit from nothing on a deposit of a loan. If you insist on them having this privilege which me nor you can have, then it already is not free market.
Its specifically because of this privilege that what they allow or disallow should be heavily regulated  because of their ability to engage in antitrust based purely on arbitrary decisions and the monopoly they have.
If anyone could start a bank that could engage in fractional reserve banking and send of its daily deposited IOUs for fresh new money then what your saying would make sense but because its a tightly knit monopoly and the vast majority of the open market cannot do this then it makes no sense at all.
(Starting a local bank or credit Union is not the same as having the privileges of the member corporations of the central banks.)
The only thing your right about is loans in bitcoins being expensive, but as you have no vision you only know what youve already seen, namley a debt based system dependent on loans, bitcoin is not a debt based system and not dependent on loans.
bitcoin disruption will happen gradually in the manner it already has by purchasing, mining, earning via trade of servives and goods.
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:26:53
Not just treasury bonds but the fiat money itself is a ponzi scheme, because its debt based it continually needs new buyers of it in order to simply maintain its price most of the buying happens through gov bonds and the other half through private and business loans from banks.
But yes it fits the definition of a ponzi as it constantly requires new buyers of debt, this explain why money supply in the long run never goes down which is really synonymous to the national debt, its also the main reasoning behind the theory of massive global financial collapse which would be akin to a ponzi collapsing.
Ironically although bitcoin is often refereed to as a ponzi it infact has no characteristics of a ponzi. 
A simply analysis is that the primary characteristic of a ponzi is that it always requires more people to join in whatever the activity is for it to survive, in terms of the fiat money system that activity is buying new debt, you could consider that it has been the populations of countrys like china and india entering into this ponzi scheme as the new suckers that have maintained it and allowed for the massive expansion of debt we see.
If a system does not require new participates to maintain itself then its not a ponzi, bitcoin does this, if no new people participate it simply holds an average value.

A double spend is achieved by transmitting the same bitcoin twice, so is there no way the protocol can recognise that the same bitcoin has been sent to two diffrent address's and are both in the process of being confirmed?
Is there no intermediary stage before a transaction is added to the blockchain that can highlight if the same bitcoin is in the process of being confirmed for two separate address's.
So an instant transaction could alert someone this bitcoin is being confirmed for another address also would you like to wait for confirmation? in which case you would. or normally it would not give you a warning as it was not being double spent.

The white paper or the bitcoin foundation is not a good place to go for economics on bitcoin. Satoshi obviously had a good understanding of economics but the white paper was focused purley on the technical aspect of bitcoin not the economics.
The economics is quite simple, value is derived from peoples time and energy, money is NOT the thing of value it simply represents the thing of value and act as a tool for its exchange therefore intrinsic value of a currency is nonsense. This is practically proven by the fact we have been working with and using paper money for decades.
Furthermore the inflation you currently see in bitcoin is not an economic decision, it is merely a necessary function in order to act as means of distributing the currency in its initial phase, eventually the inflation will be so tiny as to be near zero. 
So the economics is that it is not necessary to have either an inflationary or deflationary currency it will work quite well with a fixed supply.
However eventually bitcoin will enter into a small deflationary trend simply due to coins\passwords being lost, which Satoshi mentioned as being a gift to the rest of the bitcoin holders as the value of the lost coins will be distributed to the rest of the supply.
What we have been used to with fiat controlled money is that 1's are added to the start of the money supply when allegedly more money supply is required to allow for the total exchange of goods and services. With bitcoin money supply is always adequate also but via a completely different method of instead of adding 1's to the front of the money supply you add a 0's to the end. This way you never need to devalue the holdings of others whilst still being able to have small enough denominations to allow for the continued flow of the cheapest goods and services in the economy.

It will only make religious folk adopt it, because they are obsessed with having the scripture fulfilled. 
Bitcoin of course is the opposite of the mark of the beast, because its not required for someone to buy or sell.
If bitcoin did not come about there would be a real chance that the control of the banks via digital only fiat could indeed control if a person can buy or sell or even work if there was no cash because they have central control over your bank account.
Bitcoin prevents this, in a sense it takes all the qualitys of cash and brings it to the internet.

Makes sense for them to. People always juxtapose paypal with bitcoin but they are not the same and shouldn't really be compared. Ones a payment service provider ones a currency. Paypal could quite easily benefit from bitcoin by becoming a payment provider for it as it does with other currencys. 
After saying that there is no doubt the future finacial model of cryptocurrencys and its integration with online services such as auction websites is a clear threat to paypal but if it choses to embrace it that could lead paypal to become a leader in what would ultimately be a bigger market than what they currently hold in say a decades time.

Currency does not need intrinsic value, the purpose of currency is to allow for the transaction of value not to be of value itself. 
If people like it or not bitcoin has no intrinsic value, its price value is an abstract of the users of it and their acceptence of it as value, it is the users time and energy which produced the value of a currency.
Similar fiat currency has no intrinsic value either its value is also derived from the same place bitcoins value is namley its users, however the users of fiat have their value extracted from them by accepting fiat as valuable whereas the users of bitcoins do not because bitcoin has superior attributes to act as a currency than fiat does.
Gold has intrinsic value but that intrinsic value would be so tiny as to be insignificant if it was to be used as a currency today for example the intrinsic value of gold is its use for crafting jewlery and some other uses in semiconductors and whatnot but that intrinsic value would be far too small to back a currencys use among millions.
To put it simply the value of a currency is not derived from any intrinsic value its derived from its users time and energy and their pledge to use the currency.
If the value of bitcoin is from its intrinsic attributes of being rare, highly divisible, secure then every altcoin would instantly have the same value as bitcoin for it too would have those qualitys so of course it is not this that gives it its value what every altcoin does not have is the users bitcoin has which is where the value comes from and its where the value also comes from for fiat, hence why its fiat in the first place as the fiat is the decree by an alleged authroty that you the user must keep using and thus the fiat attempts to secure the value, bitcoin has no fiat it is more democratic you freely chose to use it.

Bill was wrong saying its being made legal tender, the bill states this.
"This bill would specify that provision does not prohibit a corporation, flexible purpose corporation, association, or individual person from issuing or using an alternative currency that is redeemable for lawful money of the United States or that has value based on the value of lawful money of the United States."
Nothing about it becoming legal tender, interestingly the bill speaks of lawful money, bitcoin already is lawful money, based on the definition of lawful, there can be no single type of money which is THE lawful money there could essentialy be endless amounts of lawful money as long as they are in the bounds of what is lawful. Understand that lawful and legal are completely different things.  so bitcoin may not be legal money but its certainly lawful. The only legal money in the US is the federal reserve dollar because legal is a formality so furthermore the federal reserve dollar is NOT lawful money.
If bitcoin is made legal tender then that would mean you could settle your tax's with bitcoin meaning the state would be accepting bitcoin as payment and thus should also have a spending budget in bitcoin if they are not turning into dollar.
Its still good news, but id say the people proposing this bill dont fully understand and in fact what they are proposing is already established by this bill.
"Lawful money" is a term used in the Federal Reserve Act, the act that authorizes the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to issue Federal Reserve notes The Act did not, however, define the term "lawful money,"

That was not the intent or the spirit of the law.
The whole idea of money transmission license needs reviewing.
It is once again a banking lobbied and written law because I swear to God I can bearly find a single person who thinks they ought to need a license to exchange THEIR money which leads me to conclude the people never wrote this law.

From what I can tell the banking system is an international one and its the same the world over.
Banks receive deposits in the form of loan agreements, cash loans, credit card loans, mortgages etc these are IOU's. So on a bank ledger they have assets and reserves and they must match. IOU's are the assets of the banks (contracts basicly) the reserves is currencys printed by the central bank for the bank in accordance with its assets.
So as you go into the bank and deposit a new asset for the bank (a loan agreement) they can get that IOU you just deposited monetised into reserves (money creation)
This is a privilege you will not get if you start your own bank they will simply allow you to secure and lend out the reserves other people have deposited.

They operate as private corporations but the privilege to issue money is a public agreement granted by government to these private entity's and this indeed can be revoked and has been revoked or granted throughout history.  
So yes contracts can always be renegotiated so they can have their privilege to issue currency on condition "fill in your terms"  
They can do whatever they want in their private capacity but without this privilege they are impotent. 
If this was an entirely private affair like you suggest then it would not be a problem because you could start your own bank in which case what care of the decisions of other private banks would you have? but you cannot simply start your own bank because it is not entirely a private affair and you do indeed need public agreements.

Once you create a full loop that's when you really start to recognise value growth. The simplist would be between 2 merchants both requiring goods or services from each other of roughly the same value both essentially exchanging the same btcs between each other over and over. The value they both create in their business grows and becomes pure profit on top of these transactions. When new means of production technology innovation come along the transaction cost for the 2 merchants will stay the same but the goods received will be more.

its not if you make more than 10k in sales its if you make more than 10k in gains so you need to deduct what you paid originally. so if you made 10% on each bitcoin you sold you would have to sell 100k of bitcoin to earn 10k in profits.
You will then be taxed 20% on the 10k you earnt so your tax bill for that year would be 2k but it will be lower than that because you can earn i think 8k before you get taxed so i think it would only be 20% of 2k so £400 tax bill for a therotically 10k profit selling bitcoin for the year.

I just think that the mass's move with extreme inertia. Paying in bitcoin is convenient but merchants and donation sites etc have not utilised the convenience of it yet.
Imagine every shop you went in down the road you had to signup an account and provide all your details before you buy, thats essentially whats been happening and whats currently happening with every shop on the internet.
It is cash which allows you to walk in any shop and pay without them having to know a thing about you.

"if I were setting it up, I’d make it exchangeable for stock. And then it’d have real value"
Let me assure you that Rand does not understand "real value", when people finally understand real value the reason something that supposedly has no value actually has value (such as fiat money or bitcoins) suddenly makes sense. 
And that is that real value within the economy is the time and energy of people. And therefore all it takes is that people/users pledge acceptance of it as payment. As you can now use that seemingly worthless thing to aquire the goods and services produced through the time and energy of those people who were always and will always be the source of all value.
For centruys we have misperceived the thing of value to be the symbol of money itself ( the gold, the dollar $ £, the bitcoin) when the real value is the time and energy of the users of these currencys, the money itself is not the value its an abstraction of it that allows for the exchange of value.

Yes its a simple setting all exchanges could have where you nominate a withdraw address and a withdraw bank account.

The fundementals is that you have a public address that you use to recieve bitcoins to like an email address you use to recieve emails you give this out in public as theres no security risk but you dont give out you email password you keep that safe you only give out your email.
Likewise with bitcoin you have your public address you can give out to people so you can recieve bitcoin but you also have your private key which is the "password" to the bitcoin 
Therefore you can generate a bitcoin address send say 1mbit to it then print out the public and private key onto the same bit of paper with amount at the top saying 1mbit and its the equivilant to say a dollar note.
The diffrence is its not like public money because it can only be exchanged privatley between trusted parties because at any time the amount on the paper wallet could be redeemed and sent to another wallet because they have the private key.

Faith is not what gives it its value for faith in itself is not the thing of value in the economy. Time and energy of people is the thing of value behind all currencys be it Bitcoin or Fiat its the same basic value thats behind it.
The faith in the currency is what ensures the bond between it and the time and energy of its users.
I would say fiat currencys are not entirely faith based they are both faith and force based. The fiat(decree) itself that you must use this currency by law to settle taxs and debts is force based, the debt behind every issuance is both faith and force based but both force and faith are not the thing of value they are the medium that links the value to the currency.

It wont go to hell. The secrete of the value of currency is that it comes from people not any intrinsic thing.
If I cut up bits of worthless paper, sign them and tell you I will wash your car each month and you can pay me with one of thoses bits of paper. 
When I do it once and I accept a piece of that paper as payment will you throw the rest away? No because I just gave them value through my acceptance of them as payment. 
Its that simple and this is why bitcoin or any currency has a value/price. So bitcoin is as sound as fiat money but sounder still because its not being counterfeit.

This is not too accurate. Firstly fiat money is not money that is not linked to a resource or based solely on government policy, it is simply what it says it is a fiat, a decree by whatever the alleged authority is that demands you must use this money.
Gold and Silver was actually also a fiat currency for the US, the alleged authority in this instance was the US Constitution which gave out the fiat that only gold and silver could be used as currency.
Furthermore it does not actually answer the question as to why a dollar has value it simply makes the statement because its limited in supply and is issued by a trusted authority it has value..... well thats not an answer. You need to first answer what is value? which is this, value is the time and energy of people, this is why things that are seemingly worthless like paper money or bitcoins can have value because all that it takes for any medium of exchange to have value is for a userbase to accept it as payment because that userbase their time and energy IS the value which is then represented in that medium of exchange.
You accept a dollar as payment but its serverly flawed as behind the scenes huge counterfeiting is going on officially via banks printing of money at point of loans which in turn is diluting the value of your time and energy your labor your wage and stealing from your savings.
This cannot happen with Bitcoins for it is a far superior form of money, it is also not a fiat money because unlike the dollar there is no demand that you settle your tax's and debts with it, so bitcoin is more democratic because the choice is yours, the choice is not yours with the dollar your compelled and if you understand now where the value of the dollar is coming from you will also understand exactly why its fiat and why they want to compelled you to keep using it.

Nice guide, worth reading other guides on that site also.
I really think the bitcoin qt should have a progress bar from green to red as change address's are used up and once it reaches red warns the user it must backup or even prevent entirely from allowing someone to transact until they do a wallet backup.
Its a bit of a disservice to not notify people of this when their money is potentially at risk and somthing should be included in the next release of qt.

Not really, not unless you are already operating in a 100% bitcoin economy, if your earning money in fiat then a bitcoin loan could easily turn soar when the value of that loan increases in relationship to your fiat income your debt will become expensive. 
In the future when bitcoin has hit saturation and whatever final value that will be and your income is in bitcoin then of course a bitcoin loan will be fine but right now be warned.
If you want to take a loan use a microfinace platform like  its fiat but at least it bypass's the fractional reserve banking system and doesnt create new money, its people lending to people rather than banks creating money and lending to people theres a world of difference.

Can the bitcoin protocol identify if the same bitcoin is in the process's of being confirmed for more than 1 address?
Therefore a wallet on receipt of an instant transaction before any confirmation could alert you saying "this transaction is being confirmed for multiple receive addresses would you like to wait for confirmation?" in which case you would.
otherwise no warning is given after say a 10sec wait after which a double spend would be highly likley to fail.

I know there are cloud mining comanys that let you purchase contacts that last 6-12 months but this is clearly not on par with being able to instantly buy or sell.

Well, bitcoins will still be mined after 21 mill but on a much smaller scale + fees. remember also the network can scale with difficulty it has no requirement to maintain a certain difficulty it can drop just well as it can rise if needed. 
A study could be done now to determine how low difficulty would go if there was only fees to be earnt through mining based on current transaction volume.
Remember the userbase in the future will be much larger and so higher transaction volume and thus higher volume of fees to be had.
As it stands right now the difficulty is far higher than what is actually required in a practical sense to provide security.

A major point is the debate around value. Why bitcoin has value or why any digital currency like the fiat dollar has value when its backed by nothing?
The answer is all value within the economy is derived from people and their time and energy engaged into producing goods and services. 
Therefore the value and thus the price of all currencys is derived from its users, more users more value, simple because the users are the value.
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:47:04
transactions are instantly viewable but confirmation can take between 1-10 mins.
How its received depends on what type of wallet you used. Some will show it instantly and tell you there are currently 0 confirmations some will not show you anything at all until you reach about 3 confirmations or even 6 which is way overkill.
sometimes if a fee is not added it will not get confirmed this does not mean you have lost your btcs it just means you need to do the transaction again with the fee in place seeing that you have sent from changetip the fee would of been automatically added.

Lets be more specific then and say miners cannot make the price go up, they can have a maximum effect of dropping the price by about 1% per month if every miner sells every coin.
the point is it wouldnt matter if the hashrate doubled today it wouldnt effect price. the amount of miners or the diffculty doesnt effect price the coins mined is still the same. Miners follow price not make it, the higher the price the more miners not the other way around.

Did you read my post? It does not matter how you cut it, if you can buy ghs and sell it at a later date for roughly the same price you bought it at then that is free bitcoins and that is exactly whats happening, because either way you get you initial bitcoins back plus the extra you mined.
Now you rightly point out the long term price as trending down and if you had read my post I point out how this is correct and what would be expected however I clearly stated from roughly April 28th its been steady, it has NOT been trending down since then hence the increasing in popularity and the possibility of a self reinforcing bubble as people get all excited about their free bitcoins and start ploughing more into it and telling their friends.
Now why it has not been trending down since that date is speculation of which I give my guess, but if it doesnt start trending down then ghash.io will certainly only increase because its free bitcoins.
Forget about price of btc in fiat its irrelevant for ghs price and btc price follow each other in the same way miner revenue and price charts do.

Wrong, when people stop buying bitcoin it just holds price as has been demonstrated over years now.
This is because it does not have th attributes of a ponzi, namley the requirment of new buyers to sustain itself. The money system has this ponzi attribute because every new unit is issued at interest therefore no new buyers of debt will eventually cause a collapse because the currency unit itself is a debt instrument that demands servicing. 
The traditional ponzi scheme required new buyers to pay off the old buyers.
Regarding intrinsic value its nonsense that intrinsic value is required for a currency. All currencys are backed by the time and energy of its users which dwarfs any form of intrinsic value and so is the only form of value suitable for backing as currency.

you cant delete your bitcoins they remain forever in the blockchain a bitcoin cannot be erased.
Your simply deleting your private key so can you no longer control those coins. 
The economic effect would be deflationary transfering the value of your bitcoins to all thoses who have bitcoins and still control their keys.
Bitcoin is inflationary as the supply slowly increases but the loss of private keys overtime is a deflationary effect and as the mining reward reduces overtime the deflationary effect of loss of private keys / death etc will outpace the inflationary effect of mining. Neither of these effects will be that significant for price. What people dont understand is Bitcoin does not need to be deflationary or inflationary, the inflationary aspect of mining is simply a necessary function to act as a means of distributing bitcoins, however theoretical if all bitcoins were equally distributed amongst all people there would be no need for this and bitcoin would still work perfectly well in economic terms, mining would still work perfectly well via fees.

It would be good if a programe can be made a bit like bittorrent programs like utorrent where instead of searching for torrents you can search for goods and services that anyone can list. Some sort of api that allow any website or online shop to automatically list its items to consolidate as many bitcoin market places into a single source of search.
There is a crucial future event for bitcoin and its when its own internal economy of the exchange of goods and services produces its price discovery rather than its foreign exchange trading. This happens simply the moment the volume of btcs used for tradings goods and services exceeds the volume traded for fiat currencys. 
The reasons its crucial is because beyond this point every bank and exchange and government could "ban" bitcoin and it would still be able to continue and propagate because it is self sustainable, it relies on nothing external. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:24:42
Residual effect of the death of mtgox maybe.
I think the perception of mtgox death is priced in now. 
In actuality btc price doesn't need to react at all to any outcome from gox either good or bad through the fact that currently the absence of gox does not effect trading, therefore any price move related to "gox news" is purely perception based and not fundamental. 
If transparent exchanges do come about price will be based far more on the fundamentals of supply and demand rather than perception. If gox was actually fractional reserving and selling bitcoins that didnt exist then that was actually creating an artificially low price of bitcoins during that period because it was creating an artificial supply of bitcoins.
Hopefully they wasnt they are just incompetent, return peoples money and become a fringe exchange rather than a major exchange.

Its true they just sell their holdings, but nothing can be purchased with bitcoins until someone has the bitcoins and the more places that accept bitcoins the more likley it will be that people will want to get bitcoins so overall its good for bitcoins.
Ideally manufacturers and suppliers start accepting bitcoin so retailers can keep some of the account holdings in bitcoins to pay their suppliers.

Practically telling people they cannot engage in a private contract the foundation of modern society.
Bitcoins are not unlawful and never can be but anything can be illegal because illegal is merely form.
See  
"The term lawful more clearly suggests an ethical content than does the word legal. The latter merely denotes compliance with technical or formal rules, whereas the former usually signifies a moral substance or ethical permissibility."
You couldnt make this stuff up.
"Legal is also used as the antithesis of equitable"

No because just like the reward for mining transaction fees will be the same if transaction fees go high more mininers join fees drop, fees drop too much miners quit fees rise, fees rise too much miners join fees drop and so on. So it will self regulate perfectly as it does now with mining coins.
The mining of coins is not actually necessary for the bitcoin economy to work it would work just fine with a static supply, mining was a means of providing the network for bitcoin to operate on which otherwise wouldn't exist as well as providing the means to distribute the coins.

well you just buy some.
Mining is not impossible, ghs price is set by the market in cloudmining meaning that although you might not get profit from mining you will still likley break even.
So for example if you bought enough ghs to earn you a bitcoin in 7 days and then sold the ghs at the end you would have 1 bitcoin at roughly $330 maybe a bit more.
You could work this out by looking at previous data on cex.io for example.
@_date: 2014-11-17 22:11:07
I said a while back that ghash would shrink and discus would grow, this is because of the cheaper average cost of living as well as cheaper energy in China.
India has the cheapest cost of living as well as cheapest energy cost so they could become big players in mining in the future but I think the heat could prevent that.

It's non sensical, he's speaking of bubbles as being ponzis.... There entirely diffrent things. If bubbles are ponzis then the majority of everything ever traded is a ponzi. A ponzis is a scheme that demands New buyers else the entire thing collapses. Gold was not a ponzi scheme neither is bitcoin if there are no new buyers it will simply hold price. 
Why is such lack of intelligence in important positions?
And as others have mentioned the banking system really is a ponzi. Because it's debt based it demands New buyers of debt constantly in order to service the old interest. Once demand for debt is saturated , collapse.

It doesn't work like that difficulty drops meaning miners leave and the reward is split between less miners, it just self adjusts.
Its impossible to calculate fees in the future because theres too many variables, for example to know if fees would rise by 2030 you would need to know what the transaction volume is and the price of btc, for even in 2030 there will still be a 1btc reward per block which could be worth as much as 25btc today who knows.
I think the confusion comes in with "how are miners going to cope with a low price" and the answer is they dont cope with a low price, if it becomes unprofitable it becomes unprofitable they have to turn off and save energy until difficult lowers to a point where its profitable to turn on again. This doesnt mean all miners suddenly dissapear because there is always a difficulty where its profitable even if it was $1 per btc.

The value of bitcoin and any currency is derived from the users of that currency via their time and energy. Therefore increase in users = increase in price (no surprise there) 
It could create an increase in price by spreading awareness of bitcoin to dells customer base where a portion may find out about bitcoin and chose to get involved. So that price rise will come but not immediately it will gradually increase userbase over the next few months.

Marc Faber is fundamentally wrong here, with regards to the value of bitcoin being in its ability to exchange into fiat. 
Its amazing that these economists still dont get what value is and where its derived. The value of bitcoin is derived from exactly the same place that the value of the dollar is, namley peoples time and energy.
Remember the value of the first bitcoin exchanges had nothing to do with fiat currency.
Also once bitcoin hits a critical mass of users accepting it, its value becomes sovereign, this critical mass may have already accured meaning that if all transactions into fiat halt the currency would still operate amongst its users with its own perceived value. 
In a sense this happened from day one but for it to happen on a larger collective scale may have not yet but I would say it is literally only a year away.

bitcoin is entirely different. Apple pay isnt anything at all, its not an innovation, your just putting your card details onto a phone and sending details via the phone rather than a card to pay, big deal.
Bitcoin is both an entirely new currency as well as an entirely new payment system there really isnt even a comparison. 
The reason many cannot see the benefits of bitcoin at the moment is because they look at it in terms of how it integrates with banking where as the whole point is it has nothing to do with banking or fiat. 
And so once you are in the realm of pure cryptocurrency as a payment system you can send any amount of money, with no restrictions, instantly, anywhere for free. 
As a currency it is not centrally controlled, no one has a monopoly on its creation, Its scarcity is guaranteed (which is a key requirement of a currency that fiat does not have) It is not debt based, each unit of existences does not demand interest which fiat does.
So its price can fluctuate much in its early days as coins are being distributed but I can assure you bitcoin is not going anywhere it absolute will not fail as people suggest, it simply cannot because its superior and never in history has the inferior prevented the superior. 
The benefit of apple pay is that it will cause behavior change in the mass's in how they pay for things with phones which is great for bitcoin.

I think one of the primary means of scaling will come from off blockchain transactions, these will also be ideal for micro transactions for they are literally fee free and instant.
However they are only possible between users of services like coinbase bitpay these servies could expand off blockchain transactions by having agreements between each other also.
For scaling some form of decentralised blockchain storage maybe like bittorent clients each user will hold just a portion of the blockchain say 6gb worth on the bitcoin-qt and so at any one time the whole chain is available.

The only way its really effects price is through perception because much of this is not real its just leveraged agreements.
These are just fiat bets on a btc price ticker it doesnt effect bitcoin supply and demand therefore its still likley mining supply being sold and merchant sales are pushing the price down.
The ideal scenario is one where adoption just about outpaces supply by a few percent so you can have a steady growth in price. However adtoption needs to be quite high to match current supply.
This does not imply however that price will continually sink because as price goes down the current userbase and adoption rate can easily cover for a smaller btc price and so there is a floor.

Baiscly ghash.io is the only pool that providers a service to its users to buy and sell hashing power instantly, sold in units of gigahashes per second (GH's).
So you can signup, deposit btcs, buy GH's and your account will instantly start mining bitcoins which you receive in your balance. At a later date you can then sell back the GH's get your original bitcoins back you bought them with plus the bitcoins you have mined in the mean time.
Now that sounds like free mining and it is free but only if the price of the GH's stays stable which for some unknown reason it has done for the last few months hence the popularity of ghash.io. 
What would be expected is that the price of the GH's drops at a pace that roughly breaks even when it comes to selling again maybe with a small gain or a small loss but currently its providing big gains. 
I would expect a drop in the price of gh's and many users of ghash will likley get burnt and not even know why.
The solution then to the current 51% issue is not really a technical one its simply a case of providing more services like ghash.io that provid trading of btc to gh's, you could one up it by providing btc and fiat to GH's.

Ok as your not familiar with any bitcoin wallets I wouldnt suggest using one that downloads the enitre blockchain.

No you dont, you dont have to convince miners of anything you have to convince the majority of bitcoin users what protocol they will prefer to use. And in the event of sustained 51% attacks the ledger is clearly illegitimate, in that scenario it wont be a hard choice for people between using a faulty blockchain full of stolen coins or a legitimate blockchain that is still clean.  
A change in algorithm for example would result in much lower difficulty at first but it would rapidly populate.

Feel a little sorry for them now, they should ground themselves and be practically realistic about how to go forward and clearly its not in mining.
Mining is a global thing and so it should be understood that ultimately mining will be workable in the parts of the world with the lowest energy costs and lowest cost of living it will ultimately migrate to those areas of the world overtime it certainly wont be in silicon valley.

If they are happy to hold bitcoins or the person they are sending to undertsands bitcoins and has their own wallet and is able to cash out cheap then it makes sense.
But if your buying bitcoins sending them to a service which then cashes them out on both ends you will likley have a 5% spread so about 10% in total cost. of course it was more or less free to send the bitcoins and if both ends where actually using bitcoins in trade with no need to cash out it would be immensely better, but the conversion of btc to fiat and then fiat to btc again still carrys quite a high fee.

At present we dont need a decentralised marketplace we just need a market place that benefits from the low cost of bitcoin.
So a well run company like what coinbase do for payment processing but for shopping with bitcoin.
Also I think instant buy prices only on everything is far more popular these days thant auctions which take time and create alot of stale posts.
A well run seller assesment process run by the company as well as buyer protection for a small fee would work.

in that alleged crisis paper it talks of hot wallets draining cold wallets, what?
I mean it was said they were incompetent but to watch your cold storage balance dwindle in comparison with your liability's over a long period of time until you literally had no assets to your liability's is ridiculous.
If you even saw a 1% divergence after a single day of trading you would pause any cold storage going into hot wallets until you knew what caused the divergence in assets to liabilitys.
And supposedly they just let thier cold wallets slowly empty over months...
There must be a way to have an exchange that uses blockchain.infos model of bitcoin storage where the users always control and store their own bitcoins and only during the actual trade itself are bitcoin held in escrow by the exchange.
This doesnt help us that have lost money to theifs however. I know some of a few well meaning people with little money in their real life that put some support behind bitcoin thought they had made a little bit of money for once only to have it all stolen.

a bitcoin is not considered an earning until it is exchanged for fiat. So you cannot tax the value of a bitcoin when mined. If they really expect this then the IRS simply have got it wrong because the law states that someone cannot be expected to do the impossible and you could go through an entire tax year of mining and not have a single dollar of earnings to pay for an alleged tax bil (how could you pay a tax bill when the truthful accounting proves you havent recieved a single dollar to pay the bill with?)l. Tax can only be calculated on actual earnings and earnings are directly related to dollar amounts.
Its funny because if whats being said is true that the IRS want to tax bitcoin and bitcoin transactions (which I havent looked into yet but im sure its not true) then they are actually treating bitcoin as a currency a taxable currency just like the dollar which I very much doubt. 
In which case it would be as if your miner mined a dollar and it paid your wages and you declared them for tax, lol.

Im not sure but if its possible to change a private key using the current private key of a public key without transacting a bitcoin this might work, but I dont think the bitcoin proctocl allows this.
So in a physical transaction there could be a machine that reads the private key from this physical bitcoin cash and changes it at the point of exchange and that change would simply be to ensure the previous holder of this cash didnt take a note of the private key to spent later and thus physical bitcoin cash is born.
Maybe some sort of machine that can erase and reprint qr codes, e-ink maybe or more likley NAND memory.

No, it is the most important development for bitcoin that people accept it as payment.

This is why inflation stats of 2-3% is nonsense. They measure it against what you can buy. But that ignores an immense force within economics which is increase in productivity, innovation, new technology etc.
So for instance lets say the entire economy is just apples and apple production. If you invent a new method of production which increases yield by 50% within the year you could also increase money supply by 50% and the price of apples will stay the same and you have a 0% inflation stat. So what people do not see is the increase in productivity has been stolen.
And this is whats been happening for decades in all areas of the economy, which is why many people scratch their heads over why all this new technology and machinery and innovation does not actually seem to be making things easier thats because its just another source of food for the banks. 
Bitcoin does indeed cut this off and if the economy was based on bitcoin we would directly see and feel the increase in abundance as new methods of productivity and manufacture where introduced.

The inflation rate of bitcoin is a necessary function in order to distribute coins at the begging stages which eventually will peta out to near zero which is a deliberate design because inflation is not needed but a distribution of coins is. 
Also the true inflation rate of the dollar is hidden by debt servicing for example the QE increase was primarily used to keep junk debt "good" and its simply held on account balances of banks distorting prices because this new money is not being realised in the actual economy. So you could have a 15% increase in money supply but have say a  1% deflation rate because the debt servicing for that year was 1% higher in value than money created. Either way you lost that purchasing power.
The fiat system is complete smoke a mirrors.

Theoretically it could continue to work even if all current bitcoins were lost, you cannot lose all bitcoins because some no matter how small the denomination, will be getting mined, so even if the vast majority where lost you could still operate from the smallest denominations and have enough currencys to always supply for the full flow of goods and services.

Has to be said however that all these places that accept bitcoin are NOT actually accepting bitcoin they are accepting fiat they are just using bitcoin as the medium to pay them in fiat.
The magic will only happen when take infowars for example their suppliers start accepting bitcoin at which point infowars start holding a portion of their income in bitcoin itself which they can spend through their suppliers.
This is really the very crucial event that needs to happen between all  business's accepting bitcoin. The fact that any business can accept bitcoin and have it converted into fiat is actually excellent for allowing quick adoption of bitcoin acceptance which can then eventually lead to the scenario above. And thats when you should start to see the explosion in price because the value is being contained within the currency itself rather than transferred into fiat which will cause a self reinforcing upwards spiral of price appreciation.
So is this  infowars webhost? need to get them to accept it.

Yes its real money. All money gets its value from the time and energy of its users because those users accept it as payment for the time and energy required to produce the goods and services purchased.
If this acceptance begins to drop or stops completely then the currency has no value. Its no diffrent with bitcoin than it is with dollars or pounds.
This is preciously why fiat money is fiat because the fiat is the attempt to force the acceptance of it whilst simultaneously debasing and counterfeiting behind the scenes while you are forced by law to accept it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 15:07:55
Its not actually its price that will determine this its the usage and user base which admittedly does effect the price directly but essentially once a critical mass of people accept bitcoin as payment the need to convert to fiat is not necessary.
Why? because currency is not the thing of value never was never has been neither is bitcoin or the pound or dollar its peoples time and energy and this is what gives all currencys their value.

In a purely bitcoin economy the government will have no debt because bitcoin is not debt based it is not issued with interest attached. Therefore there would be no national debt, the government would receive its tax in bitcoin and that would be its money for spending. It would never operate from a deficit it would operate from a surplus only. 
I would go as far to say that any government seen to go into debt should be deemed unlawful. Because a government should only ever answer to the people and debtors answer to creditors thus an indebted government is a compromised government. 
Really you be asking why cant the government survive from 20-40% of the wealth of all its citizens without borrowing? For that amount of abundance is so huge you could have roads plated with gold, literally, so why is it not enough the answer is the current money system itself.

It could be done and we are actually using exchanges based on a fiat system, with bitcoin you can indeed have a diffrent model where bitcoins remain with the users. 
This was previously impossible to do with purley fiat exchanges but it is now possible with bitcoins and I think this new model will ultimately be the favored approach in the future. 
The bitcoin should only remain on the exchange account during the duration of the trade itself once a trade is finalised bitcoins will be back in the associat5ed client account.
The wallet could still be hosted by the exchange but using a similar model to blockchain.info.

No because paper money is not the issue with the money system. Paper money is just a tool that provides another form for the medium of exchange for the underlying currency. 
The issue with the money system is the centralised control of it (fiat), the privilege to issue, as well as the fact that each issuance carrys interest which creates national debts.
This paper money is just an extension of bitcoin and its reserves can be monitored, unlike todays paper money which has no reserves at all and so for that alone it would be entirely different, also there would be no privilege on issuance and there is no fiat either. 
Free market would be active and no one would accept an issuer that stops providing proof of reserves, its exactly the same scenario of all users of coinbase and exchanges right at the moment, their account balances in bitcoins are only IOU's by thoses companys paper money is just that instead of it being a digital IOU on the screen its on paper with the addition of it not being specific to a person but simply stating the bearer and being in specific denominations.

and further stating that its the energy of man that is the creation of money, well not exactly is it Ayn? its the energy of man that is the creation of the value of the money but the creation of the money itself is by the central banks pure synthetic fabrication and so Alan Greenspan would fit into everything this piece by her supposedly loathes.

You do not create value by buying and selling, if you're making a profit you can only be extracting value. There is no good or service produced by a speculator, it is a parasitic activity. It creates and needs volatility in order to draw off its blood.

If every coin mined was sold it would roughly be a 10% drop annually, thats less than 1% drop monthly and thats if everyone sells, id say about 50% sell so its less than 0.5% monthly.
Theortically mining or inflation of bitcoin is not required if you had already had a prefunded network for bitcoin to operate on as well an evenly distrusted supply. but of course neither of these existed so mining was devised as a mere functional necessity of these two issues rather than an economic one.

In order to exchange paper wallets you have to trust the person who exchanged the paper didnt write down its private key, so it doesnt work in the same way as paper cash.
If a system could be made where you could say create a 1mbit denomonation and print them onto paper but then you would also need a system where when the paper gets exchanged the private key is rewritten.
Maybe some sort of imbedded rfid chip in the paper that could work in conjunction with a pos terminals that rewrites it at pos.
Electronic paper is just round the corner maybe it would be possible to rpograme in certain denominations of bitcoins and then simply have a refresh button on the paper that is programed to generate a new address and move the coins there, so each time you exchange the paper you simply have to press the refresh button to make sure the previous owner cant spend it again.

Im not entirely sure but if this happened the network would fork with a change to the hashing algorithm for the cryptography and everyone would end up using that with the good blockchain. No ones is going to continue to use the blockchain if a clear 50% attack has happened.

"there is no common power like a government to compel the public to use bitcoin as universally as its own fiat currency...."
This is the same sentiment of Paul Krugman. But really they are indirectly letting the cat out of the bag with these statements because they understand where the value of a currency comes from unlike the vast majority of the public or even bitcoiners and that value is the users of any currency.
And because they know this they know its good if you can force people to be users of a currency and maintain that use, normally achieved via legal tender laws. This is exactly why its called fiat money because the fiat the decree is that you MUST use it.
Therefore bitcoin is more democratic than any fiat currency because its entirely your choice to use it or not. So in answer to this guy hes right there will never be any common power to compel anyone to use bitcoin because bitcoin respects freewill (the supreme law)

The main reason for me is because it overcomes the negative effect that our current fiat money has on the economy and peoples lives. That effect is namley poverty. It is twofold, one it dilutes the value of peoples time and energy as new money is created and enters into circulation and two all new money carry's interest which creates a debt based system of personal and national debts which must be constantly and never endingly serviced. Bitcoin overcomes both of these issues which has potential to have a massive effect globally beyond what most would be willing to even imagine.

Either is was oversold previously and so its been able to hold steady for this long or its currently way overbought and is about to comes down.

Totally agree Gav, Nice one! If its not possible to implement a dynamic blocksize this time round then a 20mb or so block will give time for the best solutions to be found and general consensus meet.
Waiting years to reduce the confirmation time could be damaging though and give an alt coin an inroad if it starts to be seen as more effective for online and pos sales.

Yes it would be the same fees as amazon or ebay minus the transaction costs so probably a percent or two cheaper. However the service would equally have to provide buyer protection which it would settle on a case to case basis via its own profits. 
It would be more secure in the sense that no privacy information would need to be supplied in order to purchase maybe not even a user account would be required to purchase only just for sellers would need an account.
The reputation system would only be required for sellers as all buyers are making instant non refundable purchases so there is no buyer reputation required.

If after sending tax's for example to a tax reciept address they go through a mixer that would then be the equivalent to laundering because everyone will see its gone through a mixer and thus is now unaccountable making the department that done that openly engaged in fraud.
It wouldnt matter if it went through a mixer or simply a single address that was unknown. All address's within a public setting will have to be known. Any money sent to an unknown address or whos identity couldnt be quickly verified would be money laundering. The point is everyone will be able to see all this.
It would be near impossible to launder public funds by corrupt governments\departments if using bitcoin.

Yes but follow through the definition.
"In economics, deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services.[1] Deflation occurs when the inflation rate falls below 0%"
So if it falls below 0% that means declining money supply. As also stated in wikipedia regarding inflation. 
"Economists generally believe that high rates of inflation are caused by an excessive growth of the money supply"
ergo a negative rate of inflation would be caused by a shrinking money supply.
Its also true that prices can inflate or deflate independent of the currency being used and independent of if that currency is inflationary or deflationary, due to real economic growth or economic decline.
Basically theres a difference between economic inflation deflation and monetary or debt inflation deflation which is causing the confusion in these debates. 
Conclusion bitcoin is monetarily inflationary whilst being economically deflationary due to the real growth within the bitcoin economy outstripping its monetary inflation.

Its the users that choose, miners follow. If a void in mining appears it is rapidly and easily filled. It is only users that provide value, for example if 20% of mining moved from bitcoin to some altcoin that altcoin does not raise in price value by 20% instead you just have an over secure altcoin. If however 20% of users move from bitcoin to an altcoin that coin does indeed increase in value and the miners will follow.  Services like coinbase etc actually have a far more powerful vote because they control a userbase however even here it is still the users that vote because if they make the wrong choice their users will migrate away.

The problem is these are CFD's meaning contract for diffrence.
All these online brokers are simply CFD trading you never own the stock, you never own the gold silver or oil you never own the Bitcoins you simply have a contact with the broker to pay the diffrence on the price of the thing. 
So unfountatley even if a billion dollars of BTC's was "bought" through these brokers it would have zero effect on BTC.
It makes you laugh all these people world wide "trading" on these broker sites where its nothing of the sort, billions and billions of pounds being traded that has no actual effect it is in fact online gambling and nothing more, but call yourself a trader if it makes you feel better.
After saying that this is still Bitcoin positive because its good exposure, if these brokers actually allocated the BTCs it would be extremely good news for the price.

Who said transaction fees have to go up? They don't have to go up they have to increase in volume. In order to determine you would need medium dollar value of all fees during a years period then compare it to a later years period where the amount of transactions where double.

I dont think fees should come by creating scarcity and thus having higher fees on less transactions (which is not good for actual users) but instead should be looking to provide revenue with much higher transaction volume all paying small fees which could easily equal more value than todays blockreward. So far from punishing the network for more transactions we need to encourage more transactions.

There is not much you can do regarding external entity's making claims against you other than to continue to operate in disregard of those claims.

The FDIC guarantee is there to guarantee funds if ever anything went wrong at your bank. 
In Bitcoin your Bitcoins are already guaranteed, its impossible for the blockchain to suddenly decide your particular bitcoins no longer exist anymore unlike what a banks ledger can suddenly do with your fiat because of irresponsible practices hence the need for a guarantee. 
A Bitcoin is not a representation of an underlying asset it is the assets therefore its 100% accounted for it cant just disappear because of some agreement elsewhere.
Not to mention the FDIC is just there to give the illusion of safety its funds cannot even cover a fraction of its liability's.

If I stop you in the street and say "no you cant walk down this street like that" and you engage me and argue I immediately know I have power over you.
And so after a heated argument (which I was counting on) I say ok then I agree but can you just walk the rest of the street slowly and the person agrees.
If you make a claim and you are simply ignored on mass the claim has no power whatever, if you make a claim and people engage you on your claim  you are half way there already for the very engaging of you on your claim implys that they believe you have authority over them.

Yes Im pretty sure its the same for determinstic wallets,  make a separate backup before you start doing transactions on the new fork and that backup will always have your btc balance from the date of the backup on the old fork even if you start spending on the new fork. 
So if you have 10 btcs and you backup and date it. Then you spend 1 btc on the new updated bitcoin it will register that into the blockchain and your backup will now have 9 btc but if you load the same backup into the old fork it will show you 10 btcs again because its a diffrent blockchain and it didnt register or know about the 1 btc you spent on the other blockchain.
Its likley to be no issue because the old fork will have no users and have no value at all.
@_date: 2015-05-04 07:45:43
Off chain transactions are certainly not a fine solutions precisely because we will need more transactions fees in the future to pay for the security of the network and you dont get more transactions with off chain. Secondly you want to pay for this by increasing fees on smaller amount of transactions in your second point. Whereas by far the best route is to have many transactions ideally 100+tps all paying microfees which would easily cover the current blockreward and more and would be best for the average users.
The roadmap should be to encourage as many transactions as possible that can be comfortably handled at any given time.

Nearer the time they are going to need to inform their users if they are going with the upgrade or not so people can make a choice.
This could be a bigger issue however regardless of what fork they go with for it is more beneficial for anyone to hold the private key of their balance before the upgrade so they know they have the balance on both chains if needed, but if you hold your balance in say coinbase only you will only have the balance for the fork coinbase chose.
Im pretty confident these service will want to upgrade anyway I cant see why they would want a limited bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-11-18 16:24:22
The miners do not have half as much a say as what people think. If they really did start playing havoc with a 51% attack then its becomes immediately obvious to everyone a change is needed there isnt actually a choice at that moment, you have to change. And the choice then as it always is will be with the users who are the value of bitcoin. 
The biggest votes then does not come from miners but comes from users and services with large userbases. So that would be coinbase, blockchain.info, circle, mycellium, Hive etc all the major wallet and service providers and the users in general will decide any changes that happen not miners.
So it would be nothing more than a fork which has happened before with a new algorithm with alot of miners sitting on worthless equipment.

I think its good, these transactions still carry fees it is a requirment that transaction volume increase in order to start offsetting the loss in value of blockrewards.
We would currently need about to 75tps replace the cost reward of blocks. The more transactions the bandwidth can handle the better.

As bitcoin acceptance increases over the internet and those places that accept it start utilizing its ease of use (which they havent done yet), you will begin to notice that the option to pay in bitcoin is much easier and more convenient than fiat as no user information or account is required at all and for this reason alone people will begin to load up on a few bitcoins to put in a browser wallet simply for convenient spending.
Bitcoin is cash for the internet and as you do not need to signup an account with every shop on the street you can simply walk in pick somthing up give cash and go, the shop owner needs not know a thing about you, so can you do this with bitcoin on the internet, no privacy information is required by merchants online at all, no user account is required, no payment or privacy information is required(increasing security), The only information that might be required is an address for delivered goods and this could be built into payment option one that pays and one that pays and sends address information.
This is just one possible want that I think will become more apparent overtime.

If the majority of transactions in the future are done on payment channels then the situation is that you will have no blockreward combined with hardly any fees for miners because of low transaction volume. Meaning either the whole thing now fails because there is no security against a 51% attack or a handful of service providers are willing to pay huge fees for their small amount of transactions in which case they will own Bitcoin. 
The way Bitcoin will scale and was intent to scale (imo) is that it will allow for larger and larger transaction volume overtime with the only real limit being bandwidth, which is a huge amount of transactions.
The roadmap is to increase transactions as much as possible we want games and applications and messaging and payments and all sorts making microfees each use of the network, these mircofees will easily equal the current value of the blockreward, just by reaching paypal tps levels and likley surpass it making the Bitcoin network even more secure and transactions even cheaper than today whilst being open to as many people as wish to use it.
@_date: 2015-05-27 21:22:48
Yeah how genius, lets make 7 tps viable by making it so expensive that no one will want to make a transaction, Fixed!

Unfortunately Sprott does not understand what value is.
He ought to consider why fiat or Bitcoin is in fact already being used as an exchange of value and it might give him a clue as to what value is.
Looks like they are doing Bitgold wrong anyway from what I can tell it has nothing to do with bitcoin or the technology its just an online valut where you pay with credit card, lol these dinosaurs.
What Bitgold should be and what the name suggests is an altcoin that should be issued by the company with the agreement by the company that each unit is redeemable in a predetermined amount of gold to the bearer of the unit so instead of login into their website to buy and sell, they actually have gold backed units of exchange stored and exchanged similar to bitcoin, that can be spent anywhere to anyone who would accept it who in turn could redeem them at the company.
Essentially the company would be issuing its own gold backed currency, it doesnt even need to have customers or any details on customers because it acts more like a vending machine that doesnt care the name of the person just the authenticity of the unit being redeemed.
But this Bitgold is a joke by the looks of it, its just bullionvault with bit in its name for no reason.

My point is they are just fiat bets no different from betting on a horse the bet doesn't effect the horse the bet doesnt involve bitcoin so it doesn't effect supply and demand of bitcoin and thus price.
from bitfinex website
"For example, let's say you want to open a long position for 10 bitcoins. That means you want to buy 10 bitcoins hoping the price will go up. The system will borrow for you 10 * the price of bitcoins in US dollars (let's say 1300 USD, 10 * $130) from liquidity providers, at the best rates available. When you close your position, you will reimburse the 1300 USD USD plus the interest that has accurued. Interest fees are added to your balance once per hour."
The terminology is all smoke and mirrors bullshit, to make gamblers feel like "traders" your not buying bitcoins your placing a bet on the ticker going up and vise versa. 
The only person that can actually short bitcoins or long bitcoins are people that buy or sell bitcoins.

Thats how its designed to scale it can forever take on more because it will always increase the financial reward for miners as it does. 
So yes you could multiply the transactions by the current fee's but of course there will be other factors the more people that use it the high and higher the price of bitcoin so it might be 49 mill dollars per day but it wont be 203800\ BTC more like 2038 \ BTC. 
And then it will likley also be less than 49mil because fees would drop below 5cent maybe to 1cent but not much lower because its so negligible people would be willing to pay more to get transactions done faster.
The bottlenecks will be bandwidth capability's of transfering that many transactions.

@_date: 2015-05-02 17:34:21
Mining doesn't create the value of bitcoin if this were true you could simply forever increase the amount of mining which would automatically increase the price? of course not. people are putting the cart before the horse its the time and energy of the users of bitcoin when using bitcoin as a medium of exchange and storage that give it its value of which mining will then follow and increase or decrease according to how much value is present. 
You will find then that the average cost of miners is almost always equal to the price of btc + a small profit. So the cost of mining 1btc is the cost of 1btc + a little profit. If the value of btc jumps ahead of mining because of sudden influx of users and thus demand then there can be a gap where there is additional profit to made mining whilst the void of mining is being filled overtime to match the new value.
@_date: 2015-05-12 15:34:39

On a side note not using multisig on a hot or cold wallet is not secure enough for holding that many peoples funds.
What doesn't seem to sink in is that these business are like the traditional major banks that used to hold gold and so they need physical security just like fort knox, against armed robbery but even more importantly against insiders. Multisig that needs singing off from multiple physical locations where each location can view the others via security cameras, would be key to preventing a single employee or a physical robbery from happening.

Yeah, even if I owned 51% of mining and decided to start mining my own fork it would be the equivalent of 1 user vote amongst millions of bitcoin users I would just essentially be mining my own worthless altcoin.
Miners follow users but people tend to think miners have all this control is a misunderstanding. I would actually say its the service providers like blockchain.info coinbase bitpay etc that could act as the biggest vote because they have large userbase's but even then its still the individual users as whole that decide for if one of those service provides chose a fork that the majority were not in agreement with they would lose their users.

Main reason is that its pointless, because you cant destroy bitcoin which is really the blockchain invention not bitcoin itself. They could spend $600,000,000 + continued expenses to attempt it, which would most likley just infuriate the tax payer and produce no result.
Also if any government attempted to do it will cause alot of feedback globally of people who would probably enjoy attempting to thwart it by adding their own hashing power to the network even if they were not interested in mining. Cloud mining companys would get a huge influx of customers. 
People watch too many Hollywood movies that have given them an extremely distorted view of what they think their government is, they dont even know what bitcoin is yet let alone how to coordinate a 51% attack.

Considering theres probably only 6 million bitcoins avaiable for purchase on exchanges and probably not even that if ever just coinbase users alone bought a few each the entire supply would be gone?
So I guess coinbase are just listing dormant or empty accounts.

But paper money could easily be made, because paper money is just a promise to pay the bearer the sum on the paper. (its a contract between the bearer and issuer). The problem of course is without a central issuer you would never get universally recognised type of bitcoin paper money, the closest you could get would be multiple issuers from big recognised bitcoin companys. To redeem them you would have to take them back to the issuer so they could be taken out of circulation in exchange for the underlying bitcoin. 
So if it was coinbase for example it would have their art work, face value of 1mbit for example, a serial number and signed by ceo.
Paper wallets can be used however like prepaid cards for a one time transaction.

Yes that's exactly what it means. Those who receive the new money first get to spend it whilst prices are still low.

It shows the amount of bitcoins being loaned out at interest on an exchange in order for the people that are borrowing the coins to short. However because its a loan they need to repay those bitcoins in full. Therefore if the price doesnt go down over a period of time you know that those people who borrowed those coins will need to cover and buy them back when they close the position which I think happens automatically when position is closed and whatever price they buy back at determines if the trader made a profit or loss.
I think therefore if you see large short positions for a sustained period and you do not see the price going down you can pretty much bet that the price will spike and vise versa if you see long positions and the price is not going up it will spike down eventually to.

1Bitcoin is a peer to peer currency that acts exactly like cash but over the internet.
2 It works by a network of computers working together to maintain a ledger of ownership of bitcoins. Ownership is possible by using encryption where each user has the key to their specific btcs.
3 Wallets allow people to store and transact their bitcoins. You cannot determine how the coins were stolen without further information but the most likely scenario is the thief got the persons private key by hacking their computer.
4 They were able to cash out by exchanging into other currency's using currency exchanges or exchanging with someone in person.

They have to do it to prevent identity fraud to stop others spending your money, so its not like they are doing it to spite you they are just doing best practices within an archaic system.
This is good news for Bitcoin because its not just paypal its all credit card companys all banks and merchants that have to put in effort to prevent identity fraud and then of course solve and address all the fraud thats happening.
Its costly and burdensome and its an issue that Bitcoin payments overcomes entirely.

Because we are contemplating cash transactions here not bitcoin transactions. The idea here is that the token always remains a token of a certain value in bitcoins and can be passed around physically or stored physically, it never gets destroyed just like cash.
so if the token is 10ubits, it will have 10ubits printed on the face of it as its facevalue and always remain 10ubits the 10ubit will not be intended to be withdrawn into another public key, it will be intedned to stay on the same public key printed on that physical cash.
But the only way to do this and have true bitcoin cash that acts almost exactly like cash would be if you could dynamically change the private key on that cash at the point of exchange.

No one was obviously using the ingame store.
If it was a good game and the ingame store was popular and you got the balance right so that more was always going in than coming out the pot would grow and grow which in turn would pull in more players.
Maybe programme the game so it can reference the balance of the pot and use that number to set difficulty and then also incentivise the store more.
The bottom line is the idea is quite brilliant and could be used in all sorts of games.

Bitcoin is cash for the internet. You cannot reverse cash payments either but cash is still the most useful currency, cash on the internet also will be.
It doesnt seem to have struck people yet that its precisely bitcoins cash like quality that gauntness its success.
The truth is the archaic paper work, administration costs and loss's for merchants because of chargebacks is a massive burden.
Its just a reversal of trust, instead of merchants having to trust users, users need to trust merchants which is more efficient because users are many and merchants are few.
The way I really see Bitcoin being used on a mass scale at first is not to have your life savings in it but to be able to load a fair amount directly into browser based (addon) wallets at the click of button which can then be used for quick and easy spending on the internet, of which sites will start implementing payment option that leverage the cash like quality by never requiring user accounts from people when purchasing, it will simply be a one a click affair anywhere you go on the internet just like paying for things with cash down the street in any shop but this can only happen with non reversible transactions. 
No doubt new ways can be implemented to secure large holdings so that you cannot lose your entire balance at a wrong click, maybe a way of fractionalising your balance across many address's so it doesn't all sending from one balance before it starts another, verification notices, maybe implement messaging standards into wallets where a message can be sent with each transaction like signed emails that simply state "if you have received this transaction in error the funds belong to **** please return to send address" doesnt mean they will but its still worth it.

Bottom line is silver is subject to supply and demand and miners have not been running at a loss for more than a decade now of the alleged suppression. If miners can still make a profit which they are then that profit is proof price is not suppressed. Btc has same supply mechanic you can do all the naked shorting in the world but if people want to buy and take hold of their coin and there's no supply that will set price not betting.
The only way you can artificial suppress price or increase price is by buying or selling some artifical supply that you cannot take possession of, normally via some fractional reserve system. This is why its important that you always use services where your balance can be viewed on the blockchain.

Bitcoin doesnt have to be seen as in competition with paypal. Paypal is a payment service provider no? it deals in multiple currencys, it could quite easily see bitcoin as a profit opportunity and simply add bitcoin to its list of currencys.
What happens with companys is that at first they are not scared, they are innovating and they see potential, profit and  how much of the market they can move into but when corporations reach a certain size then a shift happens they go into a defensive mode of trying to maintain what they have and not only do all their efforts go into defense and they do not innovate anymore but innovation by others becomes a threat to them so the business model becomes like microsoft where they begin to absorb potential competitors, shelf patents etc.

On a side note fiat money does actually have some attributes of a ponzi, because of its debt based nature it demands new buyers to pay old debt the oldest debt is at the top of the pyramid where essentially all debt originates, if no new debt is bought it will collapse, hence QE.

As its cash its trustless for the merchant so really you could shop anywhere on the net with no user accounts anymore or requirement for privacy information. a Browser wallet like  could eventually one time store your email and delivery address for purchases and it could just be a case of one click payments at any site that leverages the cash like quality of bitcoin.
These sites could also automatically store order historys based on the payment address so if you ever need to refund you can login by signing a message with the purchasing address to retrieve its history.

You need about 82tps at 10cent per transaction to get the same security with just fees as we have now.
considering paypal does more than that today I think bitcoin will easily surpass 82tps in 50 years time.

And your saying somthing?
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:12:10
At a current 870 transaction per block lets just say using a 10 cent fee makes about $87 dollars in fees as opposed to the $5000 dollars in block rewards every 10 mins, currently.
87 is 1.74% of 5000 
Therefore transactions would have to increase by a factor of 57x so about 49590 transaction per block (82tps) in order for fees alone to provide the same security that we currently have right now with block rewards.
Or have I got that all wrong? If it is then im pretty sure in 50 years or whatever when there is no blockreward bitcoin would have easily reached 82tps, paypal apparently is 115tps.

I thought this the other day the interest rate on bitcoin is low and its far rarer than the usd which has higher interest? 
Also the exchanges says a default is extremely rare but all it requires is a sharp sudden move and you can say bye bye to your loaned btcs, so this risk should be factored in.

about a year ago a similar petition was made to ban bitcoin in the UK. I made a counter petition.
Acceptance of alternative currencys (Bitcoin)
Responsible department: Her Majesty's Treasury
This petition is for the acceptance of alternative currency’s to be allowed for payments of debts and tax's. Furthermore for government spending to be denominated in alternative currencys according to what they can collected in tax’s.
For the reworking or abolishment of current legal tender laws.
There is now an obvious trend towards the adoption of alternative currency’s on an international scale. The US government via congress has already discussed possibilities of incorporating alternative currencies into its operations.
We the signers of this petition believe it would be wise for the UK government to embrace such innovations in money at an early stage.
This e-petition has been rejected with the following reason given:
E-petitions cannot be used to request action on issues that are outside the responsibility of the government. This includes:
    party political material
    commercial endorsements including the promotion of any product, service or publication
    issues that are dealt with by devolved bodies, eg The Scottish Parliament
    correspondence on personal issues
E-petitions cannot be used for freedom of information requests.
So they rejected it I assume under "commercial endorsements" but why then did they have a live petition for the banning of it?

Why not just have the code reject blocks that deviate in size by +3% from an average size of the largest blocks from the last 1008(weekly) blocks and remove hardlimit?
So its similar to setting a limit but its a scalable limit restricted by time so protects against spam. It would be able to rapidly scale (at a maximum rate of weekly compounding interest of the deviate %) if **majority** of transactions start to increase in size but would limit any individuals increase in transaction size.

This is the best method of pay per view going. The example site here wont take off however because no one is going to pay for just random content, pay per view is typically for premium content or where people know what they are viewing.
How this would become popular is by acting as a portal / hosting site for people to provide video content on their own website's for content they want to charge for and there is lots of content like that where people have to get memberships to individual sites and pay subscription fees to access the content with this members wont need subscriptions they pay for only the content they want to see and watchmybit could take say 5% on all revenue generated for hosting cost/profit.

What stops one of these machines keeping a record of all the private keys its reads to later empty them making the paper wallets worthless?
If your going to recreate the paper wallet for each transaction that doesnt work its not practical, or even do a transaction and rewrite the private key on the same paper using magnetic ink. It still requires specific devices and would also require trust in every retailer that they have indeed done that.

There does need to be new regulation for banks especially with regards to antitrust and anti competition laws.
I think the current anti competition laws say banks are exempt which is absurd as they are in the position to most easily abuse  and engage in it.
A simply regulation could state that in order to have a license to run a bank you cannot exclude or terminate a current persons account with specific criteria being met, basicly it cannot be an arbitrary decision.
If the banking industry was truley a free market you could argue against this and say well its a private company they are running and they can pick and chose as they will but the truth is it is far from a free market you cannot just start a member bank and have access to the central bank this is a very privileged position of money creation and because of it these banks need heavy regulation least they abuse it which of course they do.

Governments seem bent on providing protection against risk in all areas of life, but I can never recall a time when the people officially gave the government that mandate in the first place.

I dont understand what the voting mechanism is but If some sort of mechanism is being given to the miners here I would remind that miners represent a tiny % of bitcoin users and so votes should come entirely from nodes. 
Theres no reason to be concerned about profits of miners or their willingness to include transactions because just how miners would have to switch off today if it was not economical to operate on block rewards the same mechanism would operate with fees, if the fees from nodes are too low to accept at their current energy costs they have to stop operating which lowers difficulty which lowers cost of mining which allows the cheaper fees.

I am not opposed, its just that its not a solution because the lightning network does not secure bitcoin once the block reward has gone. Satoshi designed it so that increasing transactions would increase the amount of microfees to be had by miners, thus increasing security overtime as transactions increase. Therefore there's actually a crucial need to increase transactions so fees can start taking over the block reward. All off chain services are not contributing to the security of the network.

The lighting network does not provide any security to bitcoin. So when the block reward has gone where's the security? The security comes from increasing transactions overtime so that you have more and more microfees securing the network. So Bitcoin already has the built in potential to provide visa scale transactions with each transaction costing even less in fees then now whilst having those fees pay a far greater reward to miners than the block reward currently does and thus be even more secure.

Based on the assumption fees would go to zero, do you know why fees are not at zero now? or at any stage during bitcoins life where blocks were nowhere near full? 
What would prevent miners voting the otherway and keeping blocks small? There is nothing to stop that in BIP100, it also immediately allows miners to collude making the argument that blocksize will always be just right because miners are competing with each other not exactly watertight.
@_date: 2015-08-15 10:19:10
The whole point in using items like bread, bus tickets, whatever is that its not a belief, you dont go to shadow stats or anyone, you can simply observe in your own life or by asking elders the price of things to calculate an average inflation which becomes obvious is far higher than a supposed 2% annually.

@_date: 2015-08-27 16:16:20
This is the point, you will need to upgrade in order to support it and this is what people seem to fail to understand, they think change is dependant on hashrate... if users and service providers and exchanges etc do not agree with a change then it doesnt matter what hashrate a certain update has it will not become the main fork.
The main fork is defacto the fork with the most users on it, not the longest fork.

By allowing BIP 100 you highly incentivse collusion and monpoloy, and you could well end up with a single pool, or about 4 pools that are in fact one just posing as 4, this is how the banking system works its a cartel for price fixing, without BIP 100 this is impossible. 
We need an automatic adjustable blocksize that keeps maximum blocksize just within a small percentile range of the previous maximum so that a small portion of people are always willing to pay just a little more (because cost is negligible anyway) to be sure to get included in every block therefore creating a minimum average fee.

No an altcoin is not a fork, it doesn't carry the same ledger as bitcoin.
A fork is exactly that a fork like a fork in the road, it requires somthing to exist prior in order for it to fork namley the current ledger (blockchain), an altcoin is a new blockchain entirely so its not a fork.

Really in its current state its more like an investment. One of the primary points of Bitcoin is thats its born out of a necessity for a currency that cant be inflated away, hopefuly we will soon begin to see the benefit of that in a steady but sure rise in its value.
Other than that you might find practical use in international payments or when traveling, online tipping and p2p investments through platforms like btcjam. Its going to take more time however to be accepted commonly as a currency. 
If you ever find yourself in a situation where you think your bank or government might want to freeze or confiscate your money then of course its useful there also.

There is no "lens of debt money being fake money" I didnt say that you did.
"you're bargaining on the basis that this "money created from nothing" may be worth something someday."
Really, you think the mass's of people are bargaining on that basis? they dont even know the money was created from nothing they are not bargaining on anything they borrow the money at face value, a value derived from their experience of having to earn it.
No one would argue that a loan agreement would be without consideration when the money lent was money earnt for it is known that value was previously exchanged for that money lent such as in p2p lending which is so far legitimate because there is consideration. 
A promise does constitute value but it was the bank that received a promissory note not the borrower. The bank gives no promise. 
So how does your conclusion of promise's and speculation of their value by the market constitute consideration in a loan agreement?

There is a very real argument that debts as a result of money creation are not legitimate. The very reason the third element of a contract is consideration is precisely to prevent a situation like the debt money system we have where certain privileged entity's can put others into contractual obligations with them without any consideration on their part, making it risk less for them but equally unlawful in fact. 
If the money lent was earnt prior it was of value and can be considered consideration but when its created from nothing it cannot be for a loss was impossible to be sustained.

@_date: 2015-08-27 19:20:21
Stop giving miners so much significance, there needs to be general consensus across all areas of Bitcoin not just mining, hashrate means nothing if no one is on that chain.
For example if tomorrow a large portion of pools upgraded to BIP 666 to increase maximum bitcoin supply and blockreward by 1000%, it doesnt become suddenly viable simply because a handful of miners want it, it requires the whole Bitcoin ecosystem to come to a general consensus and update to it. 
There needs to be some sort of platform to gauge what major wallet providers, exchanges, developers, users, lenders, are looking to upgrade to or if any and what their proposals are. 
Personally BIP 100 is a terrible idea, it just foster collusion and monopoly in mining, code should be neutral once implemented.

The argument for not raise blocksize and having high fees is just absurd, all it would ultimately mean is the slow fall of Bitcoin and the rising of altcoins. 
The direction and aim should be to have as many transactions as possible happening all providing microfees in fact its a necessity to secure the network once the blockreward has gone, 100,000 or even millions of microfees per block would make the current blockreward look insignificant. 
@_date: 2015-08-28 14:42:15
Exactly people don't seem to get this point.

Maybe contact blockchain.info about it, might be an option to import if you create an account first.
Or try upgrading your wallet see here 
Another way then would be to get your private key and import them into a wallet like electrum that do not require you to sync the blockchain. 
To export a private key from your Satoshi bitcoin-qt client:
    launch your bitcoin client as usual.
    click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
    click on 'debug window'
    select the 'console' tab
    type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
    type: dumpprivkey [your public key here]
    this will return the private key, you can copy it now; ensure you clear your clipboard/history afterwards
    type: walletlock

The way I see it is we are building a new type of development structure. Where we now have two primary developers that are separate and different structures.
And people now have more diversity to vote between these two. It could well turn out to be 3 or 4 well known developer groups in the future that submit changes people can chose to adopt.
So in this sense it would be good to have a hierarchy in development but only as long as there are multiple separate developer groups that were recognised. When he stated this it was not so, so I would not be in agreement.
Its irrelevant to changes made to bitcoin if you have authoritarian development or not because no major changes submitted that Bitcoin does not need or users want would get adopted anyway.
If the Devil himself submitted changes if they happened to be what is needed and what people want then it would get adopted.

Consensus is automatic dependent on what fork a majority of users chose. Therefore it nonsensical to say "without consensus", there really is no such thing when it comes to a fork. Unless you believe consensus has something to do with core devs or any small group of people, of course it doesn't, that is not how you get consensus in something as large as Bitcoin. 
Although extremely unlikely even if someone completely unknown released an update on their personal website and majority did indeed upgrade to it then this would be consensus. This is somthing you dont seem to grasp.

Its the users that ultimately decide. Miners could cause a ruckus if they wanted but it would be short lived if they made the wrong decision so they will always follow what the majority of users want. Wallet services like coinbase have an even more powerful vote because they control a userbase, but once again if they tried to push their weight about outside of what a majority of users want they would cause distrubtion short term and lose their entire userbase longterm, so its still users that chose.

Instead of blocksize to limit spam why not enforce a minimum &amp; maximum fee calculated every X amounts of blocks based on average fee paid in those blocks.
So all transactions will get included within a high medium or low range priority fee basis. But that range itself would start to adjust upwards if the network comes under spam and the attacker will be forced to always pay the low priority fee which will increase in value during heavy load.

Others also say its value is backed by mining which is equal nonsense, if it was so it would follow that you could forever increase the price simply by increasing mining power... No the value is the users. The moment someone buys or uses Bitcoin they are accepting it for value.
All currencys basicly tie into the value of the time and energy of it users made manifest in the form of goods and services which they then exchange using said currency, so the value of bitcoin when used as currency is identical to the value of fiat or the value of gold when used as a currency.

Theoretically instead of paper wallets like this, if there was a universally recognised form of bitcoin receipt, it would allow for bitcoin paper cash, for its just a redeemable receipt from the issuer to the bearer for the face value in bitcoin, which could then be used in public exchange.
Unfortunately they wouldnt be recognised anywhere so wouldn't have much use accept maybe as an investment for people who have zero technical understanding.

to be fair you cannot beat the convenience of contactless debit card payments. However this is just an interface and so the same system can be used for bitcoin and will be.
People say qr codes will be replaced and they will be for in person and checkout payments but they wont be phased out entirely because they actually provide a good use case namley they are ideal for sending money over visual mediums such as videos, print and billboards etc. 
But once again qr code technology could equally be used by the traditional payment systems in the same way bitcoin can use any payment method used by the banking system for all of these are just third party interfaces.

BIP 100 can downvote size at anytime in Bitcoins future lets say it was at 2mb capacity at some point and needs raising well it quite as easily could be voted down whatever is most profitable.
The point is if you believe in the mechanism then it should be released without a 1mb floor so it could be voted lower on release for that will always be the potential at any point going forward with BIP 100.

for the majority of transactions an instant broadcast is sufficient, for higher value transactions then wait.

**Forecasts for the growth of the
Bitcoin network made by other proposals don’t have enough predictive power.**  What accept for being 100% predictable? as opposed to BIP 100 which has zero predictability.
**BIP 100 lets members of Bitcoin community decide the block size limit, it
is the best solution in this regard.**  No it doesn't, it lets 2 or 3 people that operate mining pools decide blocksize.
Furthermore one of the most dangerous aspects of BIP 100 not addressed namely the fact that at anytime in Bitcoins future when blocksize could be much higher, the size could start being voted down if its seen to provide more short term gain in which it could continue to get voted down suffocating the network. A simple solution would be to only allow miners to vote on new upper bounds.
But then why use voting when it can all be done with code and algorithm.

They will vote for what gives them more profit period. Voting blocksize down will have the result of providing better short term gains, rather than long term ones resulting in a classic case of killing the goose that lays the golden egg. Especially if you are a mining farm that doesn't have intentions to upgrade anymore you will have far more incentive in short term gains by voting smaller blocks.
Transaction per seconds is not unpredictable, which is why an algorithm that looks up historic blocksize's could be used to set blocksize at intervals whilst rejecting any unsually large blocks, if adoption didn't increase neither would the blocksize.

If the general Bitcoin economy actually wants BIP 100 then fair enough but theres no much evidence of that.

Get your private key from bitcoin core  doing the following:-
launch your bitcoin client as usual and wait for it to load the blockchain and start up
click on 'help' in the menu bar (top right)
click on 'debug window'
select the 'console' tab
type: walletpassphrase "your walletpassphrase here" 600
type: dumpprivkey [your public key here]
this will return the private key, you can copy it now; ensure you clear your clipboard/history afterwards
type: walletlock
Then get an account at blockchain.info and import private key

Your assuming miners want blocksize to increase, why would you assume that because Bitfury says? Miners want profit, that is how Bitcoin is designed the profit motif of mining is the incentive to secure the network.
Therefore there is no doubt that the voting mechanism for miners will be used to maximise profit, and you have no idea of predicting how that will play out and so you are right predictions are never accurate.
We know full well that right now if the blocksize was halved miners would increase their income through fees, this is a fact, as seen when blocks where getting full.

The price of Bitcoin can fall to $1 and mining profit still works just fine, thats what difficulty adjustments are all about, the difficulty of any cryptocoin is in relation to its market price. 
Bitcoin doesnt promise to miners a profit, mining is by its a nature a speculative business, If miners stop making a profit that was supposed to happen, because difficulty had become too high in relation to its price and so some mining operations or a portion within those operations will have to close down. So Bitcoin has always taken advantage of the open market, what do you want to create a socialist order within Bitcoin so that all miners get a guaranteed paycheck for +10%?

bitcoin being a currency can essentially use any third party payment interface including contactless cards. 
Standards would be important though so eveyone could sing from the same hymn sheet in terms of payment interfaces. Wallet services like coinbase blockchain.info circle etc could issue contactless cards or fobs for individual user accounts for btc pos transactions but it would require a cheap device that merchants could easily aquire that could route the payment request to the correct service and user account which is then pushed to the merchant.
Online wallet services could have user options for setting your own maximum spending limit via contactless methods as well as segregating entirely what amount of your balance is avaiable to spent on the device.

If you are using blockstream rather than bitcoin that is centralisation and its worse than node centralisations because nodes cant charge but blockstream can.

Bitcoin is the solution to the problem of a cashless society. Because Bitcoin IS cash, its just the first digital form of it. So consider all the concerns of a cashless society. The banks can switch off your account, the banks can decide who you pay or even who is allowed to pay you, you cannot receive any payments that are unknown to the banks and thus the government etc etc.
Now does any of this apply to Bitcoin? No because Bitcoin is cash. 
The title of the white paper is Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic **Cash** System
Unfortunately if we are not going to upgrade to a new BIP like 101 or remove the blocksize entirely then Bitcoin obviously cannot act as a cash system or a currency for people in general but instead a settlement layer for blockstream and co.

Which is exactly the point we are eventually going to need somthing of that scale to secure the network with fees alone (although its hard to say what hashrate determines secure). 170tps is roughly 100000 transactions per 10min block @ 0.05 cent fee = about $5000 as opposed to the current block reward of about $7000 so it would be still less secure.
but 170 is not so much, remember we are talking quite a distance into the future before blockrewards are insignificant, paypal right now for example is about 90tps.
you could also say it would be feasible to increase fees to about 10cents and half it to 85 tps. But I would prefer 500tps with 0.16 cent fees....

One of the primary use cases for Bitcoin is that its cash and its yet to really be utilised. Meaning people can do transactions online at any trusted site without needing usernames or passwords as well as without needing to provide any financial details. 
Look at the two major issues this solves, people hate trying to remember and store their passwords for multiple different sites.
And second the loss of details especially financial through hacks that is ongoing. 
This would work well with one of the suggested built in broswer wallets, which you could add your one off delivery address and email for purchases globally. With some BIP support for both merchant and client side wallets this would result in just one click payments. The wallet could also store a history of invoices and orders with all required info for returns.

This is just private agreements between entity's for off chain transactions which is completely fine.
However the more off chain transactions you make a requirement by not scaling bitcoin to its potential the less secure the network becomes in the future unless you want to create large transactions fees for small volumes of transactions. 
The direction Bitcoin will go in is large volumes of transactions all adding up small fees not the other way around.

As they state they are acting from the assumption that transactions **will** be expensive in the future that is not necessarily the case.
One thing that needs taking into consideration before looking for ways to bypass transactions on the blockchain is that increased transactions are actually a requirement for going forward because it will eventually be the many fees that will be used to secure the blockchain.
We need about 170 tps to provide the same security now without the blockreward.

You can obviously explain things to greater and greater depth depending on time and audience. But assuming shortest period of time and lowest understanding audience then it would be somthing like.

People are baffled by negative interest rates, but understanding the system of money creation it is not so baffling.
The only bonds that can go negative are those being bought with newly created money including large corporations like nestle meaning these corporations and the banking corporations are one in the same.
We know they make money via interest on newly created money and that they can only create money on deposit of an IOU a bond is an IOU. If the interest they can fractionally reloan that new money out at is greater than the negative interest they are paying on the bond it is profitable, then this is why it makes sense to buy bonds at even negative rates because as we know banks relend at about 3-30% depending on loan type minus the negative rate they pay means still profit this could then potentially mean negative rates could keep falling a long way until its unprofitable for even the privileged money creators.
For the vast majority who do not have the privilege to create money and have to buy IOU's with money earnt a negative interest rate bond is absurd.

Yeah the idea of creating artificial scarcity in order to push up fees is totally the wrong approach. The roadmap should be to make bitcoin accommodate a much larger volume of transactions in the future where all the small fees add up to a large enough reward to adequately secure the network.
I am pretty sure that Satoshi was confident this would be the case anyway for it would be hard to believe that he didn't consider this and that it would of been a simple change of code to always provide a blockreward indefinetley into the future that would of made it a none issue anyway, therefore he must have thought fees would eventually cover.

You dont, Xapo like coinbase or circle are Bitcoin banks they control the keys on your behalf, therefore if they dissapear so do your coins. So it depends how much you can trust them as a service, Xapo apparently have insurance for a fee you pay so there will also be a legal contract in place.

Alot of people also seem to have this idea you need to guarantee profitability for miners. What a load of nonsense, mining for profit is by nature speculative, every downward adjustment of difficulty represents miners that had to stop mining because it was unprofitable, its designed that way.
Whining at Gavin that large blocks will make it unprofitable for miners, difficulty will always find an equilibrium for profitable mining, its not ment to maintain profitability for any threshold of difficulty as these people seem to suggest. 
Its like the same mentality as government wanting to try and force a protocol that would attempt to guarantee everything and remove risk. No, mining is speculative and risky by nature if you have over speculated and price is not as high as you thought and mining is not profitable then poof goes your mining operation.

The suggestion to use codes for each user for a proof of reserve seems very simple and straight forward and would always be upto date in real time.
Any user could just check the list to see if their code is infact there and the balance correct the total of all user balance's could then be matched to reserves on the blockchain in cold storage address's.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:25:38
 They dont actually have an explanation, but basicly its a multisig wallet where bitgo co-sign your transactions, you also have a copy of an password encrypted key incase they ever dissapear so you can cosign yourself and they also have the same copy but they dont have the password incase you lose your primary key.
But you are right it needs to be decentralised. Also by having each user control their own wallet proof of reserves is automatic or simply not required because users control their coins and can see their reserves on the blockchain. So it would solve two issues.
In some ways its not alot diffrent from what exchanges are doing now except instead of one central cold wallet they send to user controlled wallets and the centralised hot wallet would still need to be used but only for coins activley being traded.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:40:04

Thats what I was trying to explain in that your reason that it makes no sense is totally correct. But if you put yourself in the position of being able to create money which certain corporations can do then negative interest rates can still be profitable. 
The negative interest rate itself is not profitable but because they now have a new bond deposited at their bank this is considered a new asset and so the central bank can increase thats banks liability's by the amount of the new bond (money creation) the bank can now lend out those new liabilitys in a fractional reserve manner at interest rates from 3-30%ish thus easily offsetting the cost of interest they pay on the negative bond they bought to create that money.
But for me and you and all ordinary business and corporations that do not have the privilege to issue new money a negative bond can never be profitable.

Bitcoin is an online merchants wet dream they have zero risk so it does make sense to offer a discount. They can work out what percentage of their profit is lost in chargebacks and fees as well as take into account adminisatration costs for dealing with such issues and use those costs to calculate a discount rate. It would at least be 2-3%.
And if your using bitcoin as a currency yourself then you are not even paying the 1% bitpay or coinbase fee.

I think using bitgo's model would work for exchanges where you control the funds to your exchange balance, you can also retrieve your funds if you lose your keys by providing the exchange with your password to the 2nd encrypted  key they hold.
Then when you trade you will have to activate a trading session where you move funds to the active exchange wallet where you can now do instant trading once you finish trading you close the session or it will have  a timeout period where all funds get returned to your balance.
So exchange funds are no longer held in large central wallets but in individual user wallets which they control, so there could never be a single point of failure.

Bitcoins cash like quality is not even being leveraged yet for convenient payment.
I would like to see a new type of shopping basket for bitcoin only. Where payment is always just one single click for this is the potential of bitcoin because its cash.
If paying for delivery then email and delivery address can be sent via the wallet which stores the delivery address if the wallet supports that feature.
Once an item has been clicked for purchase at that instant you have been logged in creating an instant account for the purchasing address's, therefore if you ever need to do a return you can come back and login by signing a message with the address which will pull up order history of that address.
This would work best in combination with supporting wallets especially browser based wallet somewhat like kryptokit. Standards would be useful for the sending of delivey information by wallets.  
So the point in this is that you never need a username or password for any website that implements bitcoin payments this way or any privacy or financial data for making payments as well as having the convince of single click payments either for individual items or by bunching items together into a basket and then paying.

Its not sobering they are confusing non intrinsic value currencys with fiat such as paper money where that is not the case, fiat is simply where some alleged authority demands you use it so that could include gold for example.
So the mass's are catching up with starting to understand why paper money works or simply why somthing of no intrisic value works as an exchange of value and to understand it you really need to know what the core of value is within the economy, to cut a long story short its peoples time and energy.
This only gives credence to Bitcoin because for the same reason paper money has value is the same reason bitcoin has value namley the acceptance of it as payment and spending of it by its users.
If no one accepts a currency as payment anywhere it has no value if they do it does it really is that simple, what the currency itself is is irrelevant.
But people will only begin to accept and use a currency that has the right attributes.
The time and energy of the users of any currency which is its value is being extracted from the users of paper money via money printing and centralised control and dispersment of that currency the value of Bitcoin is derived from the same place as paper money except for its designed to prevent this siphoning off of energy.

I dont get why exchanges cant just do it like coinbase where your balance is held in an address that can be checked on the blockchain, confirmation would not matter because all broadcasts are made by the exchange anyway so theres no trust issue.
@_date: 2015-02-16 23:30:17
lol this question comes up about once a week.
Your Bitcoins are fine they get sent registered on the blockchain regardless of each persons client or if they are synced or not.
The key to the address you sent the bitcoins is stored in the wallet.dat so as long as you have that (and make a backup also) you have the bitcoins.
Goto  and paste in your bitcoin public address you sent the coins to and you will see the balance.

Multisig paper wallet where the store of choice is co signer of the gift card(paper wallet).
In fact it doesnt even have to be that, if its store specific like current gift cards then you pay for the gift card with bitcoin, they hold thoses coins on their inhouse wallet and they issue you a standard gift card but instead of amount being a fiat amount it would be the bitcoin amount. On redemption of the gift card they spend the equivalent amount stored.
So it would work exactly as current gift cards work. Basicly an IOU this is also how you would create public exchangeable bearer note IOU's for bitcoin (paper cash that was not paper wallets).

This new model for doing wire transfers will make it extremely difficult to block bitcoin purchases because it acts a bit like a mixer.

I dont see the problem it doesnt matter if your insync on or not the address you sent to will have those bitcoins and you have the keys to those bitcoin in your wallet.dat
If you really want instant access then just save your wallet.dat file and then drag and drop it into blockchain.info and spend it.
Or just save your wallet.dat then upgrade your bitcoinqt to latest version import it and spend.

So you are only allowed to enter your username hit enter and a code appears, then the site asks you if the code matches the sms (it does not ask you to enter the code), if it doesnt then you do not proceed to enter your password because you are on a phishing site. 
coinbase did say they have insurance for hotwallets but it must be proved to be a hack and not user error so you might have a chance at being refunded.

One thing missed when economists argue against deflationary currencys is that they are basing their reasoning on a debt based money system.
So most if not all fiat currency's are issued at interest therefore this interest is a huge debt that needs constant servicing, therefore if you cant inflate the currency you cant service that debt and so poof debts go bad and so people argue for an inflationary currency.
But bitcoin would not be a debt based system because it is not issued with interest attached and so the delfation argument is voided, it only makes sense if you compare it to the current debt based system but who said Bitcoin was designed to work within the current system? it is not, it is a new economy entirely, one that is not based on debt, therefore Bitcoin needs to be neither inflationary nor deflationary.
The reason Bitcoin is currently inflationary is not for economic reason, its merely for functional reasons in order to distribute coin in its early phase.

Yeah, because bitcoin is like cash trust reverses, namley consumers need to trust merchants but merchants need no trust at all in consumers. 
Which is actually far superior because users are many and merchants are few. Take Amazon for example if they only accepted bitcoin, they would have no need to require information from millions of users but all those millions would just have to trust 1 entity amazon. A merchant can easily be trusted even after just a short period of being established and with certain criteria.
But this trust has nothing to do with the payment system anyway.

If he was so dangerous to do business with then it is in fact the police who have failed you for they take the responsibility from the public of keeping criminals out of your life which they have failed at.
And as others have said there was no obligation on you to do anything the police requested, search you, take your phone etc, it doesnt nessacrily mean not to do these things if you feel they are reasonable then do them but always be aware your not obligated. You must understand that the police will always make claims, if you ask them, "do I have to" or "can you do that" they will always say yes if it be true or not.

I use coinbase exactly how you describe as convenience I like the company and theres no doubt it benefits the bitcoin economy.
convenience is import part of Bitcoin and its cash like quality is really yet to be leveraged, I think you should keep your eye on BIP70  and develop a browser based addon where payments can ultimately be done with one click without a user account required on the merchant sites.
When this comes along its a big deal its one of the reasons Amazon got so popular because people couldnt be arsed to remeber account logins for diffrent websites they just used a go to all place instead, Bitcoin can undo that by allowing you to pay at any merchant without an account or any details at all. 
Invoice details, dates, returns, delivery address etc can all be managed within the wallet.

This is basically illegal activity from the banks for it is not their place to regulate what customers can trade, banks are under government regulations and they have not been granted authority by the people to regulate what they can trade, that is a decision only a government can been given authority to make.
In the meantime make more peer to peer exchanges then theres no need to know whats being exchanged not that its any of there business in the first place.
Somebody should soon take up issue with their bank if they want to make these false claims rather than just immediately role over like everyone seems to be doing, and sue them for any lose's you may have incurred.
I would recommended that transferwise notice their bank saying they temporarily halted bitcoin trading to verify the legality of their banks claims, as well as notifying them of your fee schedule for daily loss's in earning + any damages which they will be liable for should it be discovered that the claims are false in legal standing.

much of the faith in bitcoin is currently derived from its ability to be converted into gbp, usd, eur etc.
However there will come a point where the use of bitcoin hits a critical mass and a phase shift accures where bitcoin has inherent value separate from fiat currency's.

I believe the initial transaction is instant when going directly to the blockchain but 1 confirmation is at least a few mintues wait is not really good enough for Point of sale, unless the value is small and the mere recognition the payment was sent is enough based on trust.
One approach could be third party services for point of sale like a paypal for bitcoin when both merchant and consumer are registered and hold accounts and so a payment between them doesn't actually require any confirmation instead the payment service provider (maybe bitpay in the future) just deducts the btc amount from one user and credits another and so the btc payments are instant confirmed by the payment provider and are guaranteed by provider.
I think however once people become more acquainted and confident in bitcoin after making hundreds of transactions they will be content with simply seeing the transaction appear without any confirmation.

Always do at least the basics, make sure the company has a history and is registered and has a contact and address.
Eventually there will be payment services like paypal but for bitcoin which can provide dispute resolution and insurance in exchange for say a 1% fee on purchases. So they will take the hit so to speak for the consumer when theres a problem but they will make a tidy profit also on purchases so it will work out.
Anyone using these services will have to register their id however which is fine it doesnt effect bitcoin, it just allows people to know who each other are when doing online business which is a must most of the time.
Maybe bitpay could think about expanding into this but eventually someone will, I would if I had the expertise but i dont.

The thing with these online forex/broker companys is they are all fake, they are just casinos, you are not actually trading anything. 
You can easily understand this now in the fact that your forex account does not have a bitcoin wallet and yet you can "trade bitcoins" of course your not trading bitcoins your simply betting on the price going up or down with a fiat currency funded account to settle with. A bitcoin never gets exchange. likewise gold and silver, oil, wheat etc never gets exchanged.
So unfortunatley its impact on bitcoin itself is zero. unless they provided you with a bitcoin wallet and actually settle your trade immediately with actual bitcoins.

They have an efficient method for buying hash power but other companys will offer the same efficiency soon, its basically an exchange for mining power and there isnt any other exchanges yet so we need more.
The deal looks good but its not actually as good as it looks, you dont actually profit from it, your balance basicly stays the same. 
It may seem its better to have your bitcoins invested in hashing power but overtime that hashing power loses value it generally loses value exactly the tune of how many btcs youve earnt from mining so its near enough a zerosum game.

Tax is a social contract you have with your government.
We grant our government the authority to tax a certain portion of our income only in exchange for benefits. when the obligation of tax no longer matches the benefits recieved it is only right that people do not wish to pay their tax for there arises the need for them to renegotiate the social contract.
One of the major problems with tax is that a vast majority of taxable money is used to finance debt on money government have borrowed from private banks that have bought the privllage of issuing the publics money supply. when the government could simply monotize its tax reciepts directly without borrowing for all the expenses it could possibility need and more and never incure a single penny of debt.
This is a major, major issue that needs addressing, bitcoin address's it because it simply bypass's this system alltogether. If governments could accpet bitcoins as payment of tax that would be great I would accept that situation and would be far happier paying tax, however this would be conditional on the grounds that all recieved payments of tax's in bitcoins where also spent in government budged in bitcoins back into the economy.
Of course nothing could be more benefical for bitcoins than for governments to accept them as payment of tax, however it is also not necessary for governments to do this for bitcoin to become major international currency.

People who have been trading bitcoins will now understand the casino type nature of traditional trading. Because on this Plus500 not a single bitcoin is being bought nor sold, just like it is with gold/silver and so its effect on bitcoin price is zero, it has no effect because its totaly hollow and empty like the world of fiance. 
Instead its all just fiat money making bets on digits on a screen if they be digits representing silver price oil or bitcoins makes no diffrence. So its just a bet on the price of BTC. More accurately they should rename their BID/ASK to UP/DOWN for that is all thats happening.
This isnt really bitcoin news in that sense, If however the forex account had bitcoin wallets and leveraged bitcoin trades with actual bitcoins thats a whole diffrent ball game but it certainly isnt that.
Infact that could be a great idea for all these gambiling addicts that like to call themelves traders. you could start up a trading platform where you make bets but instead of being funded with fiat its funded with bitcoin.
So instead of having one of these forex company allow bets on bitcoin have a new forex company that allows all trading on forex market's usd/gbp silver/eur whatever your like but the bets are being made with bitcoins for that would effect the price of bitcoin.

The government of all countrys would need a concerted effort, considering they are at war with each other thats not likely to happen. Also its not Bitcoin that would destablize if a government attempted this, its the government that attempts it that would begin to destabilize.
The government that acknowledges bitcoin or simply new forms of currency, embraces it, abolishes legal tender laws, accept payment of tax's in bitcoins, is the government that wins.
As when an idea is born and ready there is no stopping progress and a government that is too rigid has its days numbered. 
The congress of America has at least discussed this possibility which is promising .

I think after bitcoin any cryptocurrency that increases its supply faster than bitcoin is basicly a pump and dump scam.
The only true complementary cryptocurrencys to bitcoin will be those that have a slower increase in its supply than bitcoin itself. 
For the value that increases in that currency will be more evenly distributed and thus more stable.

Bitcoin is not deflationary. technically its inflationary as supply is added very slowly.
Because of the near infinatley smaller denominations of bitcoin you always have adequate money supply and dont suffer the scenario that typical deflation does where theres not enough money to go around.

I think what would be cool would be a QR code that can also give the price of what your buying. So you scan the stuff through the till or internet shopping basket and it generates a qr code with pricing also so when you scan it on your wallet it auto imputs the amount and then all you have to do is confirm or not.
So it would literally be a case of scan and confirm not typing anything.

I dont mind paypal at all, ive said many times before bitcoin is in desperate need of a payment provider that can provide consumer protection to bitcoin consumers.
If paypal want to do it in exchange for a fee on purchases than you couldnt ask for better.
The biggest bottleneck to spending of bitcoins is that you have no protection at all other than your personal trust of the person or business, once you paid the money thats it you just have to hope the goods will turn up if not what you going to do? Bitpay offers no protection. We need a payment provided where consumer and merchant register id's and maybe a fee or a premium account can provide insurance on transactions up to a certain value.
This has no effect on bitcoin whatsoever its simply a third party service but one that doesn't yet exist.

Its quite simple what the value behind a currency is, so simple that people seem to reject it as the answer but that is that its the people that accept the currency as payment and the reason that is is because people are the only value within the economy. 
With fiat they try to maintain this value by force, but none the less the value in fiat is exactly the same as bitcoin it comes from its users. With bitcoin your not forced to use it with fiat you are.
The price/value of a bitcoin is NOT derived from cryptography or the miners or cpu power or any other nonsense like that.
Its derived from you like every other currency which is proven quite simply by the fact that if everyone stopped accepting it as payment its value would drop to zero, if everyone stopped accepting fiat it would also drop to zero. 
Your time and energy is the primal root of value within the economy, when you chose a medium of exchange for that time and energy that medium of exchange will acquire a representative value, your choice of a medium of exchange is based on its attributes to act best as a medium of exchange. Bitcoin does this best because its programmable money it trumps fiat and thus we willing accept as a medium of exchange and it gains value, its value goes up in line with its adoption by people.
@_date: 2013-01-10 13:00:21
No, in fact mining has little to no effect on price, speed of supply does not change with asics.
People need to understand that the increase of supply of BTC's through mining is purley a functional aspect that creates an infrastructure for BTC to operate on. For theoretically if you had a fully funded network already in place there would be no need for mining or increasing supply,  and BTC would operate just fine.
@_date: 2013-12-29 23:03:39

The main point is that the banks are in breach of free trade laws and this should be the point raised. Essentially people are being arbitrarily prevented from freely trading. There are hundreds of cryptos as well as hundreds of thousands of virtual commodity's and virtual gaming currencys all being traded to attempt to prevent this trade is near insanity, its like a refusal to accept the future. 
The US government cannot allow this behaviour by the banks.
People seem to have this perception that banks are beyond rules and regulations but they are indeed subject to rules and regulations. And the mass perception creates the reality so when people start childishly talking about the banks as if they can do what they want without consequence, their the ones that are actually allowing that situation.

Free trade is a key point here there are many international and domestic free trade laws that secure the right to trade freely without arbitrary restrictions which is exactly what this is, there was not even any explanation, the bitcoin community shouldnt run away from this it should run towards it.

The danger of a cashless society is based on the idea that you could have your means of payment cut off simply because "computer says no" or the money powers the monopoly can control you further by discriminating.

A PaulKrugman could add value to bitcoin if it accepted them.
Value for every currency comes from the people using it (their time and energy) this is quite simply proven by the fact that if the users of any currency stop accepting it  its value drops. This is precisely why we have fiat currency, so that they can attempt to secure the value mentioned above by forcing you to use it even thought your value is being extracted via inflation.
The value of bitcoin does not come from processing power, or the invention of the blockchain or any nonsense like that it comes from you, you are the only thing that effects the price of bitcoin, because your time and energy is the only thing of value within the economy, without you no goods or services can be made manifest. 
Paul Krugman knows this Alan Greenspan knows this but they would lie to you because its your energy they want to feed of.

The answer is obvious Chinese need to start doing business with bitcoins rather than simply investing, this is utterly impossible to regulate and the Chinese government doesnt attempt to.
Its intrestings also because the web has thousands of exchanges from china selling virtual currencys for games, there is actually no diffrence, so what if any of these websites starts selling bitcoins? or what if you simply dont call it a bitcoin, its just a virtual commoditys exchange, how many virtual commodoitys do you want to buy?

The model guildwars 2 uses would work with bitcoin, where you exchange in game gold for gems but instead of gems it could easily be bitcoins. The game developers could make profit by have a 1% transaction fee on bitcoins so its good all round.
Having bitcoins be the sole currency within a game it not very likley as the mobs would actually have to drop bitcoins or a sotashi, but the method of converting the ingame currency into bitcoins just like guildwars 2 gems and gold would work a treat.

It would of been more competent for MTgox to temporarily suspend new registration for accounts until they had implemented upgrades. But oh no they kept the flood gates open allowing far more user than they knew they could handle. 
It will be far better when the use of exchanges get evenly distributed, and of course totaly amazing if a peer to peer exchange could be created but this seems an impossibility when bank transfers require you go through your banks particular interface.

You cannot calculate a ROI for mining in BTC, there are too many variables its near impossible.

Ive said this over and over on these forums. This is not an issue with bitcoin, bitcoin is a currency, it is neutral like all currencys they do not in and of themselves offer any other service for they are not services they are currencys.
Bitcoin however needs a service provider like most currencys have that takes IDs from both consumer and merchant who signup with them to facilitate protected trade. 
Im not sure why it hasnt happened yet, maybe its the expertise thats required but it should be quite profitable to receive say 1-2-3% on every purchase in exchange for protection insurance etc.
Ideally paypal themselves could do an off shot for bitcoin, however this is not likley. More likley someone like blockchain.info or bitpay expand to start offering these services which are dearly needed.

Peter has a misunderstanding of value, which is the crucial part of understanding why bitcoins work or really why fiat credit works.
Fiat credit is also digital it is nothing at all, just as bitcoin are nothing at all, but its used for most of the transactions in the world.
Why then can somthing that is nothing have value? Firstly the most IMPORTANT bit to understand about value is --&gt; value is peoples time and energy &lt;--- the unit of account for exchanging that value can be anything, as long as people agree, which is the second most important, for in the agreement what your actually doing is pledging your time and energy for that abstract unit of account thus giving it value.
So bitcoins represent the energys of all the people that have simply said "I accept bitcoin as payment" each person that does that increases the value of bitcoins because they are the value. 
Even if its a physical gold coin used as payment the gold is NOT the value the gold is merely giving the unit of exchange the correct properties to act as a unit of exchange namley rareity.
So the unit of exchange is not the value it merely acts as the exchange of value so knowing this the best form of money is that which has all the best properties to act a unit of exchange and being in the age of information we can programme the exact perfect unit of exchange with all the right properties, easily divisible, rare, instant digital transactions, secure or to put another way BITCOIN the most perfect form of money we have yet seen.

The bid price would only take a matter of time to adjust to a new asking price, that is simple logic.

Its funny because people lable Bitcoin a ponzi scheme, but in fact it actually has no traits of a ponzi scheme and the main trait being that it requires new buyers constantly to sustain itself. If there are no new buyers in bitcoin price simply maintains itself. However with fiat currency its debt based and so it does indeed need new debtors constantly to sustain itself, so we eventually reach a point of debt saturation and there are no new buyers of debt. Therefore fiat currencys are indeed a huge ponzi scheme. And whats happening now is exactly what you expect namley no new buyers therefore fabricate the buying with QE.
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:21:56
The bank invests, gets a return, whats hard to understand about that?
Why is that a ponzi scheme? a ponzi scheme has a very specific attribute and that is new buyers are constantly required because the profits are coming from the buyers.
So how would a bitcoin bank be a ponzi? it doesnt require more and more customers to prevent itself from collapsing it simply operates on whatever capacity its currently at, it could get bigger or smaller.
Its exactly the same as if you invest your own bitcoins which you can in companys in loans etc and you get a return, would you be engaged in a one man ponzi?

If you always trim back and attempt to control you will end up with less and less, you have to innovate instead.

My experience is not great either.
However when you order a product with BTC its not likley you will get your BTC's back but if you purchase with BTC's and at the same time purchase more BTC's to the tune of the amount you have purchased using fiat you can see your investment then in fiat terms and normally in fiat terms it will end up just about paying itself off but not exactly profitable. and yes mainly due to extreme delays of BFL and poor customer feedback.
I ordered a monarch with hosting, im trying to ask them for feedback about when I will actually be informed its ready, for how can you know when its being hosted and you get no reply at all, just look like it will be  a waste of money at this rate, especially now other mining companys are providing nearly double the hash for the same price.
Im pretty sure BFL had a promise that you would earn your money back within a year, maybe they have thrown that promise out the window.

would be cool if your could use your own computer to process your own transactions.
If they want to make a change to the client then what they should do is move the decimal place two spaces right so 1 btc equals roughly $1. Nows a very good time to make that change.

Majority of these issue are easily remedied by 3rd party services. You see bit coin is simply a currency. There is actually no consumer protection from the pound or the dollar the protection comes from the credit card company a credit card company could be created for bit coin if we wanted. The point is the disadvantages are incorrect because bit coin is not being compared with other currency's but third party services.
It would be more accurate to compare with bit pay or circle

I think at the present time in bitcoins development, most business that accept bitcoin payments are doing it in support of something they beleive in which could change the world and no so much for their bottom line, its true your not likley to get many people paying with BTC but it would spread awareness.
Its pretty dame easy to setup, training would be nothing more than typing the bill amount onto your wallet which will
 produce a QR code, you then take the QR code over to the table on a tablet and let them scan and pay.

Its true, I wish i had the resources and expertise to create a bitcoin bank/payment service with insurance. In exchange for insurance the service will charge a small fee on all transactions.
The user would not need a bitcoin wallet would not need to worry about encryption or security they would simply have a online account same as with online banking.

Its such a ridiculous argument that demonstrates complete lack of understand of what gives a currency value.

Well the inflated fees you talk about are the same for all international wire transfers, this is nothing to do with bitcoin itself.
Britcoin which became intersango was a uk bitcoin exchange where you could just do national transfers to fund your account. But I dont think they have a very good rep.
So a good step forward would be for each country to at least have 1 or 2 exchanges hosted in its own countrys where funding does not require international transfers and associated fees.
Other than that you can always just find someone in person using many of the known methods and do a transaction that way.

Use the exchange and set a price rather than market order.
After saying that if you do a market order you will push the price up making your purchase instantly profitable. Its not always so bad to pay a little more.
Make sure you check current sell orders before you buy.
You could just buy in chunks of 20/10k per day.

unexpected but excellent. 
but ultimatley we need a paypal for bitcoin where you dont transfer into fiat for your transactions it just stays in bitcoin. say bitpal were you have to apply for account with Id so consumer and merchant know each other and the bitpal can provide mediation and consumer protection via the fees it will generate say 1-2%
this is clearly going to happen its just whos going to do it first.

I think more importantly game developers should look to incorporate bitcoin into the game itself as a currency.
Many wont but I think they will miss the boat massivley if they dont, because the first quality game that does will be immensly popular that allows people to sell and exchange virtual goods with bitcoins and buy stuff from the ingame store with bitcoins.
devs could even incorporate bitcoin booty in the game itself which can be found or won by defeating the hardest enemys or coming first in a league or tournament.  the possbilitys are endless. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 13:18:20
I dont think bitpay does much, what your saying is exactly right you can accept bitcoins directly to your wallet yes. It shouldnt be too hard to produce a shopping cart that fetches price data and does auto conversions into the bitcoin price as well as invoice creation with transaction confirmation.
The problem for the consumer and this is a global bitcoin issue is that there is no chargeback and thus literally no protection for the consumer at all, so whatever you can do as a merchant to provide reassurance to your customers is most important.
This is why bitcoin still needs a paypal like service but for bitcoins and not fiat this does not yet exist.
we need a bitpal that registers consumer and merchant ids and provides mediation and insurance in exchange for small fees of say 1.5% on purchases, this is whats desperately needed and for some reason does not exist yet.

@_date: 2013-03-22 17:20:06
Agree with this. Money needs to flow, as people do transactions in bitcoins it will further add value because the only value that exists in an economy is people and their time and energy any currency simply allows for the exchange of that value. 
If you get 3 or 4 or more people involved in bitcoins remember now whenever you do business with them do it in bitcoins.

Its cool to see that even in Bitcoins earliest stages you can pay for most thing if you find out where and how, eventually you wont have to find out anything because it will be so common, or at least I hope it will.
One of the biggest points for Bitcoin is that it allows access for the other 6 billion of humanity to digital money storage and transfer which so far they have been blocked from having.
The instant transmission of money through any visual media via QR codes is also huge. Charity wise people could directly send money to the exact person that needs it over the TV or magazine via their QR, making charity extremely efficient with no loss of value.
Imagine for example the next red nose day event on TV where the poverty stricken African can hold up their QR code to the camera and millions watching can send instantly.

Online wallets like blockchain.info are essentially bitcoin banks.
Theres nothing to stop these services from expanding into insurance as well. So say you pay for a premium yearly service you can have a certain amount of $100,000 worth of bitcoins insured or somthing like that.
Whats also needed is a paypal like service for bitcoin where merchant and consumer need to register so both are known in transactions providing better consumer protection. If the service also charges a fee that fee on purchases could cover inssurance on disputes.

Think how many diffrent types of virtual commoditys will be up for sale, how is it even possible to stop this? 
So if they say you cant trade bitcoins so you cant trade litecoins? and if they say you cant trade litecoins so you cant trade peercoins? 
What about in game virtual currencys thats for trade all over the web thousands of websites theres essentially no difference so you cant trade that either? Game devlopers themselves have in game exchanges for buying and selling virtual currencys with "real" money. like this  and theres thousands of these and their technically no different at all from bitcoin.
I dont think its realistic nor viable that a government would attempt to stop this trade, its the trade of the future. Virtual commoditys will be a major commodity. 
It would be like going to the advent of the internet and attempting to ban the trade of digitally downloadable music, video and software and expecting realistically that that would still be in place today in 2013...

Disagreed, speculator activity is purely parasitical. There are always sellers and buyers on exchanges anyway for other reason other than speculation. Just like foreign exchanges in airports for people moving within different jurisdictions and then theres those involved in business's that need to exchange currency's and then there are just people who are buying and selling genuinely. Speculators are the ones making the transactions between those genuine buyers and sellers more expensive, this is where their leeched profits come from.

If someone had the knowledge it would be possible to setup a bank just like any online broker where you can be issued a visa card, but with the addition of a bitcoin backend so to speak. So you could determine the buffer amount you wish to always have in your native currency say $500 and then anything addition will automacialy be put into your bitcoin holdings, when you spend part of that $500 on the card the bank will automatically exchange bitcoins to dollars to bring you buffer level back to $500 or whatever youve chosen.
So this way your only ever keep fiat currency to the amount you have specified as your buffer and anything above is converted to bitcoins, and you get all the usual benefits of a bank account.
So you can essentially now accept your wages in bitcoins when your being paid with fiat into a normal bank account, all it takes is a little additional service of auto exchanging.

I guess that was their reason. 
But as they have accepted a petition already for the banning of bitcoin that would mean according to their definition they have accepted a petition for a commercial product. 
Even if it was bitcoin I was specifically referring to in the petition (which it was not it was for alternative currency's in general with mention of bitcoin) it would not be a commercial endorsement, for bitcoin is not a company or a product owned by a commercial entity.
