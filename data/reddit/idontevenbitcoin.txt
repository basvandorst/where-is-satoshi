There is already research done in this direction:

Are people aware of the script included in the repository to verify the binaries?

Was there an error message from Bitcoin Core?

IIRC, the key for private use signed the release key.

Enable "coin control features" in the GUI of the qt client so you can easily select the inputs when creating the transaction.

Thank you, I just did this but the new transaction does not yet show up in block explorers. Lets hope some miners picked it up...

Let's hope some miner restarts their daemon some day, thus dropping the mempool and my new transaction can jump in...

-25 was the error code. (c.f. op)

The risks are well known. You can theoretically double spend any 0-conf transaction (taking the risk that the double spend will not work, though). On the other hand, everyone accepting a 0-conf transaction takes the risk that it will be double spend.

Can you try to download the statically-linked Bitcoin Core binaries from bitcoin.org?
