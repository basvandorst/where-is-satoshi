Also, if a gigabyte of data/space, assuming gigabyte blocks, is cheaper than the transaction fee for the legacy bitcoin blockchain I'm not sure that's a strong argument.
But again I want btc to succeed, I just don't believe in it anymore.  I sold my last one at 19k but I'm happy to buy back in once things get better.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:16:27
Its the same shape as the banking system, with people dependent on large groups instead of being decentralized and trading with each other everyone is trading through a "bank".
When the goal of bitcoin is supposed to be peer to peer cash not peer to side chain to giant node to side chain to peer. Maybe im misunderstanding something but that sounds exactly like the banking system. Just with private accounts that the banks don't have access to.

Its not anger to recognize what happens to people who never have to struggle for anything. Struggling and suffering and sacrificing is what makes good people, people who never do those things all turn out to be disconnected from reality like the "Affluenza" kid a few years back.
Imagine an entire society of affluenza. 
Not to mention the abject immorality required to implement such a system by depriving those who do work and sacrifice the fruit of their labor just to give to people who will not do anything. Like all government subsidies when you pay for bad behavior you get more of it.

Id also like to add that the only thing worse than BU implementation or Segwit implementation is threatening to split the blockchain. Price volatility may very well be good in some ways, but civil wars are not.
Civil wars dont help anyone, both solutions have their merits, one is a more immediate and kinda scary fix one is a less immediate and less scary fix.
It would behoove everyone to just back whichever one gets majority consensus and not cause chaos just because you put have taken a personal or emotional stake in something. And if neither gets a majority the stubborn people who are emotionally invested need to take a hard look in the mirror as to why they believe what they believe.

So those are lower tax rates. They arent wealth redistribution. 
I would agree that its unfair for them to get tax deals that smaller companies dont, but that is a seperate issue.
Youre trying to compare taxing people and then giving the money to people who didnt earn it with never taxing them to begin with.
No money is being taken or given in the latter case, and it is staying with the people who earned it and not being stolen by the state. This is generally a good thing.
Youre using the same bad logic that AOC used when they fought off the Amazon headquarters in New York. She even came up with ideas for spending the "subsidy" that isnt going to Amazon. Not realizing that the move was a net gain for them, and that they dont have any more money, or freed up money, to spend elsewhere. They are poorer.

If you wanna try it do it with less than 10% of your portfolio and don't risk more than 10% of that on any single trade. Once you've seen a few thousand dollars vanish in a second you will learn not to fool around with trading this way. Or really trading in general.

In any voluntary way. 
Do you think there is really no solution other than theft? Especially for something as basic as water? People cry all the time about the government giving water away to corporations for nothing/next to nothing. 


Is entirely privatized and voluntary other than farm subsidies which no political party likes unless they are using them to buy votes. 
Was privatized and is now a quasi private/state forced monopoly. Not really a step forward. 
How will we make roads without holy government road technology. Its probably impossible. I guess we have to step on people...
There are private/voluntary solutions to every problem. If you only see violence as the answer then you are the problem, and are no different than a barbarian. Worse actually... since you don't know you are one and think you are enlightened.

You support and encourage state violence to get what you want. Everything the state does is funded via coercion and violence.
@_date: 2019-12-16 03:33:17
You answered your own question, but told a bit of a fib at the same time.
The state doesnt represent the will of the people because the people are never asked if they wanted to be represented by the state.
Its the lack of consent that is the problem. The state doesn't have it, and isnt interested in acquiring it or checking if it still has it.
There are millions of ways for people to orgsnize themselves, to limit your thinking to violence as the sole solution is no way to think.

@_date: 2019-12-16 15:11:49


I didn't say that, but its amusing how propagandized people are that that is often their take away from someone saying that consent is very important.


Because I don't speak the language, my family isn't there, I don't know my way around, I am a different culture, and I don't want to die. None of those reasons are an excuse for the state to violate the consent of any individual, and if you think it is you are a bit of a thug so lets hope you don't think that.
Those places are victims of their states as well. They would be much better off without their kleptocracies, and without foreign meddling from massive states.
@_date: 2019-12-16 13:20:23


If i stick you in a room with 4 men and let you choose who fucks you are you still raped?
Choosing your ruler is not consent unless you can choose none.


Then people should be able to leave it and start their own groups voluntarily. 


Every individual has the right to self defense and the right to seek out and form defensive measures of any kind.


Yes because states are super effective at dealing with those issues today and certainly havent been responsible for creating, funding, or inspiring terrorists.
The US and countries like it dont have those issues because of its culture and because it can defend itself. Thats all people need. Any organization of people can do those things.
To the extent the US does have gang issues its self inflicted by the state itself prohibiting free trade.
The drug cartels exist because of  prohibitions on drugs by states around the world. Cartels that are so powerful that they can literally opppse and control governments.
A free world would have never had that issue. In the first place. Which is why we should do everything possible to shrink state power and encourage free trade.
When you limit freedom and choice you leave violence as the only answer.

The people margin trading are what gets me. Is crypto not crazy enough without multiplying your gains and losses?
I don't even see how these people predict any of it, other than shorting huge spikes, and maybe whale manipulation.

I bought some in an attempt to stop the rise, like a sacrifice to a pagan god, and it kept going up.
God is pissed.

I would guess its because they are waiting on the 2mb block increase.

Because it's not a currency, it's a store of value, and it's not meant to be used to buy coffee, and it was always intended to be this way. Also, don't read the whitepaper that jerk doesn't know what he is talking about.

Ways of making bitcoin easier to use. And not as overwhelming.

I officially have no idea what is happening.

If the market cap grows they will lose their power. I mean as it stands Bill Gates could buy every Bitcoin at its current price and then just throw it away.
Wont happen for obvious reasons, but the fact that a single can do that means a coordinated effort from a business can easily do it as well and probably with a lot less. They just have to get a signal out that its moving a certain way and boom.
Hell they may have posted this gif... lol

Satoshi/USD parity when?

I had considered using them in the past, glad I didn't make that mistake. I hope you get your money back. 
Shit.. I even mentioned them to a friend, better tell him too.
Purse, if you are reading this. Ya done fucked up.

Though they can make your life hell if they know you have some. 
Or just imprison you.

Yellen actually says that people knowing what the Fed does would be bad for the Fed.
I agree with her.

Ripple and stellar have been running wild.
I sold my stellar on Friday. Big  mistake!

It'll go down, but it will very likely go way way up in the long run. Best advice for this stuff is don't panic and just chill.
Definitely don't watch it like a hawk, or try to trade it a whole bunch unless you just want to take that risk.

I am. With all of the scaling/congestion problems I expected it to not be viable and end up hurting more than helping.

Banks arent the problem, its their relationship with the state thats the problem.

And the cut away ASAP!
Probably trained to cut away no matter what it said lol, but it's good conspiracy fuel. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:37:36
where is the market cap going?
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:59:47
Have they clarified position? I can't find anything concrete.

Theres a fun video of some guy offering people a silver bar, for like a dollar, right out side of a precious metal dealers, and none of them will buy it from him.
He even tells a few of them how much its worth.

I thought the entire point of 2fa was that it couldn't be broken with out the authenticator.
I found that in particularly really weird.

Question. If I have my bitcoin on my keepkey and the blockchain splits and two currencies are maintained  how do I get both of them out of my keepkey?
Like if I send from my keepkey to an exchange how would it know that I have both coins?
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:49:09
Does running the BIP91 software really mean they support segwit?
Or are they just trying not to lose their coins in the event of a chain split?
