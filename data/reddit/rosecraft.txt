The destruction of Fiat currency is drawing closer.
My take on Ray Dalio is that he is trying to protect his Family's fortune by getting ahead of this politically so he doesn't become a prime target after the Crash.

Doesn't matter who you Vote into Office. Democrat or Republican, neither of them want to be responsible for popping the Largest Economic Bubble in Human History. 
So instead, they will spend until the Currency Collapses.

That's partially true, but we are talking about inflation on prices being inadvertently dictated by Government through Printing. 
So Printing = Tax
Thus forcing people to work harder to make up for that loss.
Working harder for less isn't good.

They can't if the prices are going up. That's what Eldermuerto was referring to.
