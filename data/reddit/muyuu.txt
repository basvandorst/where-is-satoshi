No PoW makes it either:
- Sybil-vulnerable
- Permissioned (directly[1] or indirectly[2])
*1 via signatories either signing the blocks or establishing checkpoints
*2 actors need to be identified, becoming subject to external authorities of any kind
Doesn't seem to me like having Blockchain defined to include these pointless concepts is useful, these are just signed append-only databases which are a very old thing. Maybe new for bankers, but not for computer scientists.
@_date: 2016-04-11 18:40:29
I consider "blockchain technology" laughable as a term at this point, as it's so obviously used to avoid saying Bitcoin. I can't help but grin when someone says it.
Leaving that aside.
I think it would be most appropriate to use a different term. I think "distributed ledger" is fine for what they usually mean. Also, other alternatives are not even single chains of blocks, but rather tree structures. Blockchain makes little sense IMO. And if you consider "chained blocks" to be blockchains then the floppy disks in my Commodore 64 use blockchains, because that's exactly how its Disc OS is defined. That is a very pointless definition and removes all merit from the major invention that is the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-11 18:02:52
I don't believe the problems with PoW are remotely as serious as those in the alternative (who are almost invariably a superset of them).
I don't consider it correct to call blockchain something that departs so significantly from the "canonical" one. I also think it's dangerous and confusing for newcomers to co-opt the term and widen it to "alternatives" that fail to share at least one fundamental characteristic with it.
Feel free to disagree.
@_date: 2016-04-07 08:48:17
A blockchain as a "chain of blocks" is hardly an invention or a useful term. Bitcoin's blockchain is a breakthrough.

Common misconception.
You only buy until you reach an exposure limit. However good the odds are, there is always an optimal exposure lower than 100%
This misconception is why volatility destroys amateurs even when they have accurate prediction models, because they have no clue on how to calculate bet sizes vs their bank.

I love how the term "disingenuous" is dropped so easily without any support. Do you think I'm pretending to ignore anything?
For me, presenting increasingly complex solutions and playing "vulnerability whack-a-mole" is not satisfactory.
I think it's *disingenuous* to be aware of these problems and go ahead and reply "proof of stake" as a "solution" to a non-problem. Every "problem" in PoW is present in PoS and then some. So, hardly a solution, and much less in this context.
Having said that, we are not discussing this. We are discussing what a blockchain is. If you agree that it's defined on Satoshi's whitepaper, then PoW is undoubtedly there. Because removing PoW is without the shadow of a doubt a **MAJOR** change with massive implications.

They are using append-only databases rather than blockchains which are a concrete subset of these - whether they know it or not is a different story. The problem with widening the definition to that is that it becomes rather pointless, and also contradictory with the design described in the original Bitcoin white paper. Wouldn't be the first time that a term is co-opted though.

Yes, that's correct. I'd also contest that sybil-proof mechanisms that work, so far are all based on PoW and the others have such big known problems they shouldn't be even considered for permissionless value transfer. Therefore remain academic - or permissioned, which doesn't interest me to be honest.
@_date: 2016-04-14 11:22:08

I'm not sure what you mean but Bitcoin IS regulated and exchanging Bitcoin and fiat IS VERY REGULATED in both directions.
So that whole premise is false to begin with.
In fact this regulation plays a big part in making other means of transaction not involving exchanges more uneconomical. As long as I get paid my salary in fiat and a lot of economic actors in my environment won't take anything but fiat, I cannot escape monetary regulation. And then again, in my country (UK) and in the US as well, as is in Japan, there certainly is some regulation regarding Bitcoin already even without the interfacing with fiat.

I know most people in the Bitcoin community disagree, but I think the limit should indeed be removed. A constant mining rate of say 10BTC per block would work fine and stabilise with the amount of coins lost. Effectively that's a 0% inflation rate (constant linear growth not exponential).

The blockchain research done in these other chains is hardly valid for Bitcoin as they are so rare and limited to a bunch of insiders who rarely transact other than for speculating with BTC.
By completely removing a predictable limit you are creating an economy where node viability is hard to predict and effectively pushing a lot of them to either go out eventually, or start looking at filtering free/cheap transactions whereas they didn't have much incentive to do so before. If miners start implementing their own relay filtering en-masse this can have strong ramifications in the protocol.
Transaction price, block size, hardware and networking costs, decentralization, etc all form part of a market that is far from perfect. The moving average limit is also a limit. In effect we have a managed moving average already as devs and miners (and the community at large) will push for bigger blocks if blocks are not big enough. The difference being that they can check all the variables and the environment and see if something else is getting out of hand as a result. This means that other tweaks can be considered as well, something that the moving average algorithm would discourage.
The argument for a hard block limit (on top of maybe some longish moving average limit) is strong: decentralization is important and hard to quantify, which is why he transaction fee/mining market does not guarantee it. We want many nodes and we want them in many different countries, not having a few in (temporarily) favourable locations.

Yeah that's not true. There's only a cubic increase from 0 characters to 3 characters. This is because x^n is x^3 if and only if n=3. The function is exponential, which is not cubic and cannot be possibly fitted to a cubic unless for this case (0 to 3). 
In the problem at hand there are no cubes anywhere. At all. None. Zip.
If the key increases in N characters, the growth is exp(X, M+N) - exp(X, M) where M is the original key length before the increase. That's very close to exp(X, M+N) and far far bigger than exp(X, N) for any M and N integers bigger than 1.
The example from 1 char to 4 chars is detailed in a post I wrote above. That's not cubic, it's a lot closer to a power of 4. It's always going to be close to a power of the bigger length.

Mining power can still be pooled outside of this mechanism.
The assumption of having people not mine for pools that pool outside of this mechanism or seem to be doing so on the side, is similar to the assumption that people won't mine for a ~50% pool. 
All mechanisms I've read about are making assumptions or this type, or are vulnerable to Sybil attacks. I don't think a backwards compatible mechanism that doesn't rely on people just willingly collaborating up to a point is possible. This is roughly equivalent to the original assumption regarding &gt;50% mining: "miners have an incentive against undermining their own work".
Another simple counterargument is that, as mining is poolable at ~0% penalty, anything that can be attacked with physical control of a certain hardware, can also be attacked with pooled hardware at essentially no cost. The assumption being that people won't openly collaborate with such a thing, but then again this is an assumption roughly as soft as the assumption that people won't mine for a pool that already has ~50% of the network.

Saving is fundamental to economy as longer term plans need capital and securitization that isn't fully debt-based. Debt in an inflationary economy is bad enough, but in a deflationary economy it's suicidal.
Also, mindless consumption is bad for a number of reasons.
The lack of savings and capital is the main characteristic of a third world economy. Taking this to the extreme is definitely a bad thing.

Taking anything other than the highest by volume is prejudice.
DOGE adds a constant mining scheme after a point, something I believe should be adopted by Bitcoin.
As for QRK here is the Quark scheme for the noobs:
1 Set a very high number of total coins.
2 A few people mined 95% of all quarks in a very short period of time.
3 Agreement among the early miners to hold on their coins expect a very few for trading on the market.
4 Give quarks to people with some decent audience (i.e. Bill Still + Max Keiser) so they can promote it.
5 Resulting a high number of buyer on the market + very few coins available for trading = high market prices in a short period of time.
6 High market prices X total mined coins (which 95% held by a small group of people) = super artificially high market capitalization.
7 Noobs look on coinmarketcap.com and say "WOW quark is very promising!"
8 Rinse and repeat 4-7

This is consistently defended by those with the virtual money printing press but it's not scientific fact. We have never observed ceteris paribus that inflatable money is better than sound (backed, non-inflatable) money for the common person.
It definitely is better for those who receive the newly created money themselves or people close to them.
Another mantra is that stimulating consumption as much as possible is good in any situation. This is not based on reason nor evidence either.
I'm quite convinced that under any monetary production curve there are equilibrium points. For better or worse.
The other small gift that inflation proponents typically omit is that the newly created money is not shared directly to the people, but showered to the government (who becomes "the people" with respect to money and power) and then the people may see some of it when it trickles down to the economy, by battling it out with each other.

And I repeat, the situation around withdrawals has only worsened lately but it was unacceptable for a very long time, but most people didn't complain when it meant BTC valuation was artificially higher than other exchanges.
Trying to impose a listing criteria to a third party is socialistic. Most exchanges have hurdles of different sorts to get your $$/€€/££/BTC/... in and out. I've had some of my dough hijacked at some point in all major exchanges, Bitstamp and BTC-e included.

In terms of economic effect both are holding coins and not spending them. Same effect, only the sentiment and bias of the word really changes.
You are not necessarily hurting the BTC economy by not spending if you think it's best for you for whatever reason to hold.
But it's worth noting that you can always replenish if you spend so it's not rational to speculate with the price long term when you can buy something in BTC now regardless of the price (provided you can replenish at a similar price).

The thing is... email is more than that. If you call email any abstract static messaging system with these features then sure this isn't going away.
But email establishes a concrete protocol that may well die and most people wouldn't even know as far as their email addresses remained working.
That's the kind of death I can see email undergoing and not necessarily in a distant future. POP3, IMAP and SMTP are all pretty much transparent and it's only the messaging and the features that users care about. There only needs to be a transparent service substituting it in the background and that's that.
Back in the day using email meant you had an actual client in your computer and a server in your directly contracted ISP. In this respect email is mostly dead, all of that is typically outsourced to providers like gmail, hotmail, yahoo, etc and people use web clients. For the most part it's just a few providers using the underlying protocols. The analogy is that people wouldn't have wallet software and used web clients from banks instead. Precisely the opposite of what I think BTC is about (some people may disagree though - for some people it's all just about inflation control).

Honestly if Gmail died overnight a lot of people would stop trusting email providers altogether and start using other means of messaging.
Email remains important but it's not the only game in town any more.
I wouldn't be too surprised if the usage of email as a protocol (POP3, IMAP) declined gradually into insignificance, even if the format of email addresses prevailed to be used with more modern protocols, and also as simple id tokens.
IMO this will be overcome just like the first massive Gox hack but to pretend the Bitcoin ecosystem and community cannot be damaged very seriously by big service failures is delusional. Human factors do matter. In this case though, I think it's for the best because I believe in the hardcore approach of not blindly trusting anyone. I hope people learn to use exchanges as an untrusted vehicle where you are making a bet just by having funds in it. Buy/sell a bit and get out - rinse and repeat. Exchange in person. Use your coins directly for products and services and commerce with BTC in your trade. That's the way I believe BTC has a bright future so I think less focus on BTC-as-a-mere-trading-platform is a good thing.

It grew by 10GB+ IIRC. But most importantly, it multiplied its size and it continues growing exponentially right now.
Even if this trend doesn't continue until it outgrows the average HDD, still most people won't dedicate their whole HDD to keep the blockchain.
The size of the blockchain is a real problem and you can see how we are having much fewer nodes despite having many more users.
Saying HDD prices are beating the size increase in the blockchain is just A LIE. Plain and simple. I'm as pro-Bitcoin as they come but I object to lying about this because it just doesn't work as a defense. This problem won't solve itself by letting HDDs grow faster than the blockchain. Just no.

Bitcoin is not static. It's constantly evolving and one can have a position on which of the roadmaps looks more promising. What won't happen is that it stays exactly like it is now. Plenty of factors affect people involved in Bitcoin.

The thing is they don't. You don't need to actually run a node or do anything other than announce yourself and accept connections to be counted as a node. You can fail to validate and relay transactions or even blocks and still be counted.

Regrettably, the best we have is the guarantee that *running nodes is cheap* and *mining is profitable for small operations* (which is not the case). Because otherwise, numbers can be faked. There is no tight PoW limited number of nodes or number of independent miners. We cannot guarantee much in this respect even if we had a given metric in mind.

(95,221^4 - 95,221) more combinations in a 4-char string than in a 1-char string. This is a lot closer to 95,221^4 than to 95,221^3.
You can change the 95,221 to however many chars there are in the version you are using, but the point remains.
UTF-8 encodes 1,112,064 points many of which have no character assigned. It's also variable length so not really a proper way to measure the length of a passkey.

It's not a threat against Bitcoin. It's a threat on the roadmap prioritising SegWit and layer 2 solutions rather than blindly increasing block size. It's a threat that can be perfectly credible and won't go away by simply ignoring it.


That's sophism. If you don't achieve your intended goals, that's the definition of failure.


Except others more willing to HF can alter Bitcoin with a much lower level of hashing consensus (50%+ rather than 95%+) let alone community consensus, which can be absolutely trampled over.
Other players are threatening not just to block SW, but also pushing reckless HFs and alternative pretend "scaling solutions".
If the only threat was stalemate then it wouldn't necessarily require any rushed reaction. But the alternative is not stalemate, it's having morons like Ver and Peter tRoll setting the roadmap. It's a political attack, and it matters.

- It's a traditional finance platform (spread betting, CFD) with some repercussion.
- An embargo similar to that experienced in BTC platforms (ID requests for AML reasons) is being experienced in a generic platform, and an important one traded in the LSE. This is not a "Bitcoin thing" that won't happen to you elsewhere.

Best value in 2010 (around September-October which is usually a good moment to buy) were 2TB consumer drives around $100(4 years ago).
Currently best value is around $120 for a 3TB drive.
That rate of decrease does not match the rate of increase of the blockchain in the same period, which is over x1000 and growing closer to exponentially than linearly.
At this rate in a few years very few people will hold the blockchain. The effect is real, much fewer people bother being nodes now than they used to despite the massive increase in popularity.
Yeah it's a concern and hopefully it would be sorted or ameliorated somehow or there will be increasing centralisation of that concrete responsibility.

If you don't consider the fee paid it really means nothing.
When the blocks are full of *high fee* txs and the backlog is *long*, then we have a problem. Of course, there are many opinions on how high is too high, and how low is too low, and how long is too long for the backlog (arguably, there's also too short* a backlog).

Not only that, it's also a complete non-sequitur that because of Nakamoto Consensus you are legitimated to attack a different chain and deny transactions from happening in it.
However it's an empty a bluff as it gets. No miner has the resources to automatically dominate a new PoW. 100M US$ wouldn't even begin to buy you 51% of the mining power if the community started to GPU-mine or CPU-mine a new PoW. There are billions in equipment waiting for the opportunity to mine Bitcoin again. Bitcoin mining is worth orders of magnitude more than these 100M US$ on short notice.
PS: I think it would be a good idea to change the PoW in testnet and carry on development of L2 there. A PoW change in the main Core blockchain would be a lot more legitimate later on with more drastic improvement to show for it.

Nope, it's not so simple. That implicitly assumes the price/cost to be the same for everybody. Mining is cheap for some, and expensive for most, for a complex mix of reasons one of which is close access to certain energy subsidies or manufacturing insiders.

Pool centralisation has little to do with whether it's working or not. The same applies for Bitcoin, which could now perfectly be mined by a 90% hashing power that is coordinated in one way or another and deciding to break up their hashing to keep an illusion of decentralisation. Do we agree that this in no way disproves Bitcoin? From listening to your podcast I'd say we do.


It's not a very good analogy, since the sandwich reaches Namecoin just fine as we speak and it wouldn't if the merge mining operation was equivalent to eating the sandwich twice. 
The problem with merged mining is that the hashing power to subvert the network theoretically exists and is simply disengaged. That could also be said of CPU based mining or altcoins using the same PoW as Bitcoin. That existence of hashing power outside the system that could attack consensus makes coordinated attacks more feasible, but in the case of a merged coin that is not a currency and doesn't intend to compete with Bitcoin, the incentives are not there. Even Luke is fine with it. Or Paul Sztorc  . I'm sure they'd also like to know why are you so sure that merged mining is equivalent to eating a sandwich twice.

Not really, no. 
PrivKey is what you need to claim UTXOs to its corresponding PubKey, but that is not necessarily what "wallet" refers to. Usually you'd recreate a wallet from a seed but that depends on the wallet software/system you are using.
Note that there's also varying levels of security in what you are calling "secure my bitcoins". If what you want is to just store a USB with key pairs in such a way that whoever finds it has your BTC, you can just use a paper and write down the key pairs. If your security is going to be based on the security of your storage then you can do that. 
You can improve things by encrypting what you store. See  or using a USB and encrypting it (consider that USB drives can become corrupted and irrecoverable, and also bad quality paper can become illegible over the years).

Transaction fees per block around 1 BTC right now.

Looks to me like you're the one challenging that it's viable. Namecoin "works" as in no real attacks have compromised their security. Their problem is that it isn't user friendly and nobody cares about their little corner of the internet (maybe as a result).


Where are the double spends? How does any PoW system proves itself other than by running and resisting consensus attacks?


Nice strawman, but if you provided any proof or just moderately solid evidence I'd be glad to change my mind.
The incentives for not subverting consensus in namecoin are that if names there where valuable enough for people to try to subvert their consensus then a lot more people would be merge mining. Also, the way it's designed you need to go back to where the name was first registered to change its ownership, or find where the owner tries to renew it and attack the renewal. Both things present significant practical difficulties.

Of course, and we need models in this space all the time. Even if the underlying conditions change and the models may need to change as well, as happened with the whole Bitcoin incentive system over time. At this point even the original client can only be considered a PoC.
The scenario you describe in the video makes more sense to the incentives of miners than their current, rather irrational behaviour (which I assume is an artefact of asymmetric information and perception). However, this can also happen.

That's so clueless it boggles the mind. Please have a cursory look at the concepts of market failure and the conditions required for efficient markets. Markets can and do often completely fail to work, as in the obvious case where resources are allocated predominantly outside of the market.


I hold plenty, since pretty early on, and I complain not of Bitcoin in general but about a stalemate that could be broken in pretty catastrophic fashion as has happened to other cryptos before. I see plenty of people who matter complaining about the current situation, including some of the most prolific developers.

The threat is there but it's essentially theoretical if the incentives don't manifest themselves for long enough. A bit like with early Bitcoin.
For me that makes it viable enough, until proven otherwise empirically. It's just a lot more expensive to attack than it is to simply use and benefit from it. It could be argued that if there was real incentive to attack it, there would also be a lot more merged mining going on, making it safe enough. It's a bit in the middle of bootstrapping.
I'm reasonably sceptical too, as I am about long term Bitcoin despite being all for it. The fact that it's bootstrapped itself thus far doesn't mean it won't falter in the future with less block reward if fees continue to be suppressed and the costs for maintaining honest miners and nodes continues rising.

I don't think it makes much sense in a general case at this point in time. It makes a lot of sense if your clients want to stay anonymous to banks/payment providers, and it makes extra sense if they don't need to identify themselves or provide an address. For instance, VPN services or file-sharing services.
You can make your products/services also available for BTC but that will carry a premium that most people won't be interested in paying for the vast majority of businesses unless you justify it somehow (see the point above about privacy).

9-10% won't stop a soft fork for a long time because of variance, and also in the case of SegWit, because there's a strong economic incentive to use it once it's out and you only shoot yourself in the foot if you don't.

Can't deny it's still a hard problem and free-for-all doesn't quite solve it. New generations find that all the good soil is taken, got to simply deal with it. There is no real solution to that, and pretending it doesn't matter just comes across as a very naive point of view. To some degree you are imposing costs on others rules or no rules. So probably a good example on why is that problematic. In the case of EC you are imposing costs on others on whom you depend, which is even worse.
@_date: 2017-03-28 12:40:21
You would have a balance in both chains. What they'd be worth is a different story. Also, there are considerations regarding replay attacks that haven't been sorted yet, so stay tuned if you intend to move BTC around after a fork or trade between chains.

Sorry not to address the whole thing, 2:45AM now.
When you target a decentralised network with a botnet, your resources can only target simultaneously a number of individual targets before they are diluted below breaking point.
Suppose you have a 10k strong botnet (there are botnets even much bigger for rent) and you have an attack that requires 100 or so units to take a node down. With your botnet, you can knock 10k/100=100 nodes. Each extra node divides your entire operation for simultaneous attacks, making it exponentially harder for you to attack (and attacks are thus logarithmically effective the more units of attack you add compared to the number of nodes the network has).
We already experienced this in BitcoinXT and the NXT network (which was completely brought down in a series of attacks). Just a few hundred nodes is not enough even for simple generic DDoS attacks, let alone if they can manage to craft specific requests that are more effective in exhausting node resources. (Worst case: BU being brought down by a single carefully prepared message). The attack only needs to be able to rotate through subsets that are fragile then deny the rest, so it's really needed to have an excess of nodes to survive such attacks.
What prevents these attacks is that several thousands of nodes is still pretty big for even the biggest botnets provided there are no serious problems with the handling of specific requests. I'd be willing to bet that the network could be brought down if we went lower than a thousand or so real full nodes, however I'd rather not get anywhere near so we don't have to test exactly when it's vulnerable to such attacks.

Nope, you are not wrong.

Hashpower won't be comparable under different PoW if that becomes necessary. Therefore the argument is moot.
I fully agree that if BTU in any event won the hashing war, then BTC will have to switch PoW to guarantee stability. BTC will keep all the best developers in the space and BTU can continue on a legacy software system maintained by amateurs. See how that goes.

It depends entirely on the sort of tx that will become popular in the future.
I'd say it should be towards the high end of that range *when the fees are high* as a matter of incentive to use smaller txs. When there's plenty of block to spare people are likely to get away with bigger txs and those will be relatively common. Which is not such a big deal because not all will be stored forever or transferred to every node.
@_date: 2016-03-17 09:47:47


Correct, but it must be emphasized that the advantage we're talking about here is not necessarily aligned with the incentives of the system as a whole - only individual miners. This could be dangerous, like validation-less mining as we saw in the past.

They can do all sorts of things. It's not hard to fake nodes with quite sophistication, and there's even open source for this because it can be used to help bridge connections.
However a simple generic DDoS may work. In the XT attacks they were merely network attacks, they completely shut the home connections of these nodes with DNS request DDoS and similar stuff, leaving people offline for days.


Generally you want to have so many this is not even a consideration, because it's helpful to run a node anyway. But yeah, it would be nice to have specific information of the cost to bring down the network given a number of nodes (which, by the way, we don't know for sure because they can be faked - we can only guarantee to make them affordable, anything else is guessing).
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:11:36
There are proven flaws that need sorting before experimenting with significantly bigger blocksizes.
As a developer, ignoring these flaws and knowingly going ahead would make me responsible for any possible events, including successful attacks by a third party.
I believe most Core developers agree with this sentiment and won't take this step, even under duress from the miners.
This difference of approach is not even academic. There is proof that if Core ran BTU-quality code, the whole network would have been brought down because of a zero-day remote exploit. This is critical software, this is not a game that you can patch it and call it a day.

There's no way 90%+ of them were awake and idle at the time of the crash. Plus, no other effect other than temporarily going offline so the vast majority of them would have not had skin in the game.

I participate in the dev list since long ago - mostly just lurk - just not with this nickname or my identity for personal reasons.
This is just a bit of a mess. UASF never happened, and certainly not for BIP16. For starters versionbits didn't even exist at the time.
Now, if you want to support a putsch for setting a deadline and doing a one-time activation of SegWit in the Core client, then that would at least be a clear proposition. It would probably be a disaster as well, but it would be clear and it wouldn't wildly mislead people into allowing a backdoor for arbitrary SFs.
UASF is pretty bad, and its defence is extremely loaded politically with mendacious terms like "economic majority" when talking about nodes that can be spoofed and falsified. If that makes it to a BIP I'd expect it to be NACKed the hell out until at least major changes are made to it stripping the whole basic idea of having nodes run arbitrary SFs without clear indication of the network consensus via PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:07:16
I thought they wanted the opposite, Core not taking leadership and just providing their code for the community to decide whether to support or not.

Implementations must be named somehow.
This happens to be the name given by the person who invented the technique and who developed the first PoC, and who also supports the final version of it that he partly developed himself.
I think you will have a hard time taking away the credibility of that implementation being called SegWit. Any potential, so far non-existent as far as I'm aware, alternatives would have to struggle for that right.

Supposedly this is already fixed since just before this post was published (haven't tested the fix).

The issue here is that StorJ does not require immutability and this is proven beyond refutation by the fact that they can just switch blockchains like that.
They could run on their own and transact in the market.
They don't do that because they use their "token denominations" as a peg to a secondary market instead. They are simply using the blockchain as a secondary marketplace and not to transact. They could be transacting BTC in the ETH blockchain for all they care. Whether ETH is secure and actually works over the long term is a different issue. So long, they have just checkpointed out of consensus because some important guys in the scene had to be bailed out of their own fuck-up.
Their choice. Not really an use case for the Bitcoin blockchain in my opinion. Should run their own and trade whatever there (if PoS works, why don't they??). Gimmick.

That's the thing. We know these people, unless you're talking about a possible future crypto or some crypto I don't know about.
Mind you, the network effect of Bitcoin is a lot stronger than the inertia of using one search engine or the other. I was around in the times of Lycos, Altavista, Yahoo, and I had nearly zero commitment to either of them as I do to Google as a search engine. However switching to another crypto would be very costly to me in several ways and it would take some serious convincing - much more so when Bitcoin can adopt virtually any clear improvement.
@_date: 2017-03-24 02:34:39
They should not be able to blatantly collude against the interests of the rest of the ecosystem.
This obviously breaks the assumptions on malicious hashing not being able to reach a majority, in fact the WP speaks of a stronger condition: not being able to cooperate. They are supposed to act in a distributed way without communication for the purposes of fee+reward collection. That is all.
Miners have a provision that guarantees their payment cannot be bypassed: they cannot be forced to include any transactions. So you pay now, or you pay 10 minutes later. Rinse and repeat, and there is no way to make them work for nothing. It's a simple, robust mechanism.
For my money, a change of PoW is a very positive outcome and I hope they don't capitulate completely making it harder to have it happen soon. The question should be whether we do it in a progressive way so they can recoup investments and we don't punish honest miners unnecessarily, or we have to do it in a sudden and destructive way.

Not really.
If exchanges fail to agree on the conditions of listing, they will all be unsafe. You may have your coins stranded.
You cannot trade an asset simultaneously in several markets and define it differently. Majority volume will bankrupt minority volume and there will be uncovered losses.
People love the ideas of competition and voting, they are familiar and they elicit positive associations. But they don't apply across markets on the same asset. Failure to standardise will end up in disaster for all of them.

Eclipse attacks in general are attacks based on shielding the target from the network, controlling totally or partially what they can see.
If UASF works by suppressing the propagation of certain blocks, IMO it qualifies no doubt as an "eclipse attack". Although the name may be controversial because it carries "attack". In reality, every time a node decides to set rules on which txs and/or blocks it propagates it's doing the same thing. I do it with dust (which I define more generously than the default). Doing it in a coordinated fashion can seriously impact the orphan rates of some blocks.

It's complex stuff, I don't have numbers with me right now but last year there were dozens of threads full of calculations and real-life bandwidth numbers from many node operators.
It's a P2P gossiping network, usage doesn't really go up linearly. In fact we already do dubious shit like having a centralised network for low-latency access to blocks. People just assume we can just increase blocks a lot and full nodes (real ones, not faked pseudonodes) are not going to drop like flies, especially in countries with not-so-cheap good broadband.

I think this is captured by the "being more modest" approach.
BU's team has an incredible amount of self-confidence to churn out rube-goldberg mechanisms straight into production without any peer review (in such a critical system no less). I don't think the XT people would have done any better if they tried stuff like that. I think this was pressure to keep up with the progress from Core, which is impossible when you are 3 odd part timers with zero experience in the field.
It definitely makes more sense to be "more modest" in these conditions, and it was a compliment to XT and Classic in comparison.
What worries me is that Peter R is so confident that Core will just track "BTU consensus", he's willing to plan on it and gamble a nasty split on it. This IMO is even a lot worse than incompetence in terms of software engineering practices.
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:45:24
It does not HAVE to be any single central actor which monitor the chain, I guess you are not willingly ignoring this? And it also makes a difference that this actor is more or less decentralised, obviously.
Coordination of this network guard breaks the system. It's the bouncers taking over management of the club, by brute force. The paper talks about decentralisation to avoid this possible collusion. It's not there anymore, pretty obviously.

That's why I said I can understand this view.
However the system is still relatively vulnerable without a robust limit blocks that isn't painful to the "normal" usage of the system, especially during high subsidy days. This about it like a website which takes too long to filter and service requests. Enough usage is indistinguishable from a DoS attack. You can say a DDoS attack is not an attack, since that's what servers are made for: servicing requests. However, under certain circumstances they are certainly attacks and they have to be accounted for, with measures in place so priority requests get through.
People are paying wildly under cost for persisting and gossiping their transactions and they are still up in arms because of the cost. It's not a crazy idea to intervene in such situations even if it's just setting defaults to lower the impact of the problem.

Ok, but let's not pretend this is an infallible measure because they can start spoofing even more nodes than they already spoof at any given time. It's not hard to fake hundreds of them, and not even validate shit or keep the blockchain. They haven't got around to spoof this yet.
But this looks, right now, incredibly damning. They are comparatively very, very few.
EDIT: interestingly, this matches very closely my estimations. Based on survival during the zero-day attacks.

There is a fundamental divide in vision.
If you are in the side of the "alternative" devs, then best of luck. That's what it essentially boils down to.
What you cannot do is force people to work against their own ideals just because you so wish.
And that is why the split is actually needed, it has become crystal clear one side won't let the other side progress within the same chain.
I'm listening if you think you can convince me otherwise, but evidence collected over the last 5 years is pretty damn strong by now.
I give you that, I'm "fortunate" (let's put it this way) that I'm in very strong general agreement with the majority of the dev community. If it was the other way around I'd be pretty screwed. But that's no fault of my own.

They are two really wide sentences indeed, they cover a lot very succinctly.


Seems like you know better than the bulk of Core. Amazing.


There are no populist technical problems. There are problems that affect a lot of people, which is very different. Using simplistic solutions that appeal to people without a deep understanding of the whole spectrum of the scalability issue, is just not acceptable.
You have plenty of disagreements inside of the development process, but only a couple of primadonnas have ever taken it to the audience. This just made things so much worse - but I frankly doubt they actually wanted to solve the problems. They just wanted to get their way. This is the epitome of mediocrity in science.

East Asia (China + Japan + Taiwan + South Korea) dominates chip manufacturing overwhelmingly, and it's a sector with a massively high entry barrier.
In the case of mining it's even worse because the end product has higher value locally, because of energy costs. So it makes even less sense for foreigners to pool resources in order to build up miners that wouldn't be as competitive in their home countries. Doing business locally in China is a lot easier for the Chinese.

If the majority of the hashing were in an out-of-consensus chain, Bitcoin would be automatically vulnerable to several attacks based on hashing power.
There is no realistic scenario in which Bitcoin as it is stays stable with a fork like that.

According to this you need the BIP9 mechanism to trigger.
Looking at the actual code:
It doesn't alter the thresholds, it just makes activation mandatory after ActivationTime.
There are obviously real implications of making SFs mandatory as if they were HFs. For instance the possibility of splitting the network on a SF would exist. But does this mean the SF is going to be made mandatory anytime sooner than the vast majority of the miners adopting it? not according to the current implementation.
Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:58:00
Really hard to predict. But earlier than a couple of weeks seems impossible. And it may actually not happen.
I assume it would become clear at least days in advance. I don't think they would lower the hashing requirement without notice, but you never know with BTU - they are a complete shitshow.

This is top notch.
The sad part is that, despite disagreeing with the bigblocker general idea towards scalability, I do think they used to have at least rational points before. But now that ship has sailed and it has degenerated to a point where redemption seems nigh on impossible.
I made a short list the other day off the top of my head with absurdities believed by BU proponents:
- BU is production ready
- releasing unsigned binaries in a Bitcoin(/BTU) node-wallet is acceptable, provided we later show some source leaked by accident
- if we deal with two releases appallingly badly but differently, it means there is a double standard if you criticise both
- a team of economists and politicians will stand up against a team of engineers in maintaining a big C++ repository, and the one they themselves built at that
- if something is wrong in the code, even if Core works, it's Core's bug and writing rants about it with insulting critique to Core will make them look really smart
- putting jokes and political names in variables, obfuscating diff comparisons between their repo and Core even further, is a solid idea and will help back-port the fixes Core's team finds
- throwing resources at that rotting repository that has been corrupted over many moons is a sensible investment
- variants of similar technology made by Core and their much larger team are a good idea. Let's do thin blocks instead of compact, because X and Y told me it's better. And with this great record they must be right
- SegWit is bad, FlexTrans is good (see the point just above this one)
- Did I say SegWit is bad? I mean SegWit as SF is bad. It's good as a HF. I simultaneously defend this point and the previous, completely contradicting one. Even in the same post.
- Our nodes are crashing left and right, and right now there is a huge spike in visitors to the sub. Success!!! we are winning (literal)
- I restarted my crashed node with a hack put together in an unsigned binary, or through a flag that basically disables pointless bloat from my software -&gt; drama over, success!! we can go home proud (literal as well(??!))
- LN is not working in the real world (thanks to our relentless boycott it's relegated to Testnet) - they have no solution. Glorious BU exists in the real world
- Our 4 part timers are overwhelmed with the complexity of the code repository. Let's start another fringe fork in Github
-  [...]
Ever since we've had many, many more, on top of those I simply couldn't just think of right off the bat.
For instance, they mistakenly believe that what happened in TestNet means SegWit is backwards incompatible. I challenged them on that saying that if that was the case, then it's a HF and is that not what they wanted?

Those who think that the moderation here is bad - think again. Of course it's not perfect and it will have false-positive mistakes, but a community so attacked like this one required a bit of an overkill immunity, and certainly toxicity. Or else we're done.

It's a long term solution, just not specifically for on-chain scaling. For that, it's only a short term solution.
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:23:10
You just provided an example yourself.
There are several implementations that respect consensus and don't try to break up Bitcoin in a myriad of pointless alt-Bitcoins that would be worth a grand total of fuck-all combined.
If you want to run a libbitcoin node or a btcd node then please do. I run Knots.
BU is a clusterfuck of dumbness and Classic + XT are not much better in essence, although I'd expect their code quality to be much more acceptable. Their idea is still fundamentally broken. 
Obviously you can do whatever you want. But running (or spoofing!) these consensus-breaking implementations is plain and simply an attack on Bitcoin right now. Especially if you mine.

Ok. Actually your reply is not so crazy on a second read. It's just that you ignored when nullc clarified that you explained the cases besides physical theft, and you still sort of went to physical theft.

If the Bitcoin they defend is one where running a node at home is almost or completely out of the question, I want it to be THE FIRST POINT so they understand we have a completely irreconciliable idea of what Bitcoin is supposed to be.

That is also protocol impositions and extortion. Which is probably common in China, but it doesn't fly that much internationally and certainly not in this community. I'm 100% in support of PoW change on those grounds alone.

Even in this thread people are making wrong assumptions.
If BTU doesn't exist by the end of the year, BCU = 0. If it does, then each is exchangeable for its token at their trading price.
A lot of people are assuming it's a 1:1 bet.
There's also the reorg conditions. If BTU reorgs, they wipe everybody and call it a day. The most obvious thing would be to wait for at least some time before doing that, and freeze trading in the event of reorgs. Like happened with alts.

Glad you've seen the light, but XT and Classic had plenty in common con BU and they are solidly the same movement. The main difference is that they were a lot more modest (barely did anything in the code other than the "ideological" bits) and by the time they started diverging they were already irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:24:41
I know how it's supposed to work (according to BUIPs). Implementation details seem to be much worse than I even anticipated. I assumed they would at least try to make it work other than by expecting miners to behave perfectly. And it would be vulnerable even in that hypothesis.
Miner choice in real-time with the necessity of each party to research and guess parameters is way beyond wishful thinking and well into the realms of insanity.
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:07:22

It's very likely that Bitcoin as a hashing network consumes much less electricity now than it did in the middle of the CPU or GPU eras, and also that this energy is overall cleaner.
Hashing was tiny back then in comparison, but it was done in machines that were orders of magnitude less efficient for it.

I believe that in the event of BTU gaining majority chain status and being accepted to be BTC over the longer term, they will simply wipe out everybody, because they already committed to respect at least temporarily BTC cross-exchange in the event of a minority chain. That would lead to a reorg and would be a major clusterfuck.

That parameter is way too critical to just give it up to a vote and hope they vote right, when stake doesn't necessarily reflects sufficient decentralisation.

The BotNet theory was always FUD based on a flawed model. BotNets work much more effectively on sudden attacks so they can stay stealthy most of the time. They also run mostly on average hardware that will be much less effective that hardware chosen a bit carefully for the task.

Can't ignore current constraints and current operational costs.
The main argument IMO is that some defend a Bitcoin where node operation is outside of the budget of the majority of users. This is a deal breaker for me, and the situation is even worse without fraud proofs - it would be pretty critical anyway because of the fragility it would cause.
Before going there I'd have to see a realistic path for censorship resistance.

On top of that, I think the complexity of the changes needs to be considered as well. Testnet testing time needs to be allocated on top of these, which may not be feasible for the most critical changes.
Things like an emergency PoW change or a rollback to a previous version need to be ready to go online almost immediately, IMO.
@_date: 2016-03-30 13:58:07
I believe this is relatively legitimate, as it is to orphan blocks supporting a hard-fork you are against.
It can be done, so we have to deal with it. Contention is a feature and these are existing tools to escalate it.
PS: this is not new. Let them burn their BTC away. The good news is that the combined hashing power of these rent-a-hash is nowhere near enough to activate any soft or hard forks. So for the time being, let them burn their funds away.

I understand that attempts to modify the protocol for one's own gain are hostile, whatever your role in the system is.
Miners are not charities. They have a job to do and a clear business model that cannot be bypassed by anyone. They are not in a position to ask for anything without raising suspicion. Particularly, large ones that can lobby and block improvements. I've been a miner for a long while in the past.

I can imagine many ways you can potentially implement UASF. So, it really depends largely on how you do it so that a split isn't almost a certainty. Ideally it would be pressure to incentivise miners to adopt a certain set of consensus rules, but it wouldn't trigger without a very large majority of them because the risk of a lingering split is very real.

PoW is what determines consensus. So it both finds consensus within the rules and what the rules are.

For that, Bitcoin is entirely technically inappropriate. A PoW blockchain makes zero sense for that and it's much less efficient than other systems based on permissioned distributed databases using the PAXOS system or something similar.
Zero chance for Bitcoin to compete in that government coordinated banking structure. Ask R3 what their conclusions were (pretty predictable).

I've said elsewhere, but I seriously think miners should be able to coordinate against coordinated threats like that. I know it gets meta, but these attacks are nothing-at-stake and they just make more and more of them, it gets unbearable. 
One even gets thoughts like the arbitrary coinbase string being an attack vector, since one can put arbitrary bot commands for miners. But then again, you can also do it elsewhere in the block, so maybe helpless.
Imagine coming with something like :
/O:[string][x%]/ meaning they'll orphan any block with "string" when they rally "x%" support :D Sort of the crazy napkin and pen improvised masterplan BU would just put in production straight away :D

You can predict consistent behaviour. The logical thing is to assume they have ulterior motives other than the immediate reward system.


Not with a minority of the hashing power. If a majority of miners had insisted in blocking P2SH it wouldn't have happened.
I've seen this comparison made out of the blue a number of times when it doesn't apply in any way whatsoever.
The only common ground is that a flag time block was set to coordinate the switch, but the support was overwhelming from the get go and we knew it. Still, even like that there were problems, so go figure.
Mining thresholds were an *improvement* on this to avoid these problems. Now, with large swathes of the mining power vehemently rejecting the SF, there is no way in hell this wouldn't be an unmitigated disaster.
But the kicker is that nobody has proposed this. The infamous proposal "UASF" is not a one-off SF activation for SegWit on a flag time block. It's a mechanism to make all SFs activate like that with every node ultimately deciding which code to incorporate (I guess de facto Core would have a large say, but still). I can't even begin to imagine this clusterfuck of a procedure getting approved into Core. You can do essentially anything as a SF, so it's incredibly reckless to open the floodgates to this potential trojan horse.

So yeah, your assertion above that "they are never attacked" is plainly and demonstrably wrong. Almost every coin that has some market depth is attacked in many ways including mining-based attacks where they apply, and it makes a huge difference to be the strongest by far (Bitcoin).

Urgency has set in in the dev community when a credible threat of 51% attack has appeared. This is perfectly legitimate.

That's right, but the anonymity issue is important, for many reasons. This message would probably get derailed if he justified it on that, when this issue is not "partisan" and has wide implications.
IMO bias is not even the main issue. The main issue is being (almost) compulsorily traceable. But it works for bias too.

One is more complete than the other.
The misleading part I was talking about is "Bitcoin Core (BTC)" leading to the impression that BTC stands for Bitcoin Core.
You can never avoid the fact that, when a whole statement doesn't fit, some details will be lost. Not necessarily the main issue nor for nefarious intentions. That's where our interpretations differ.

When I accuse I do it clearly. I don't throw a stone and then hide my hand.
I don't think you communicate with the required honesty in a crisis like this. You say you agree to the general message of something and then deny all the effective points. This document is not a "statement that a HF is increasingly likely" - that would be a moronic statement. It was a contingency document with clear decisions. You said you agreed to the general message and then deny every decision: BTC brand decision, listing decision, BTC is Core regardless of chain length decision. Everything. Give me a break.
If you don't then that is fine. Be clear. Withdraw your support to the document.

Yep, especially if it's a sudden one.
But there's near total agreement on that, so I can't see the problem.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:44:37
It implies that any soft-fork ever proposed will activate on a flag date on whichever arbitrary nodes run it without any possibility of knowing which.
It also implies clusters of UASF-activated would possibly *not know* about a longer chain being widely propagated in the network.
There are many possible network effects and attacks that can pop out from the fact of not having the slightest idea of which SFs every node is applying and some of them could cause consensus splits because these nodes make the SFs compulsory rather than opt-in (on top of other possible splits because of discrepancies in the interpretation of the ledger due to SF logic).
It's a bit of a shit-show and I sure hope it doesn't get into Core somehow. Which I find very unlikely because people in Core know what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:02:58
So you didn't keep a copy of what you read? And you signed it?

Why would you promise something that can be suicidal in some circumstances?
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:25:39
The MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant is supposed to do exactly that. That's why it was introduced in the first place, so blocks wouldn't grow unbounded crowding out the nodes by resource usage costs.
If every time the blocks approach it we just raise, then there is zero point to it other than one-time mitigation of outlier traffic.
Blocks will eventually need to be regularly full so there's point in mining at the beginning of every block, because reward approaches zero making it pointless to miners, eventually, to use energy until there are enough fees to collect.
I hope you realise this topic is years old and there is no need to repeat it every other day in these basic terms.

It's not a formal definition in terms of implementation though. But on the bright side, the proposals themselves don't mention such thing.
@_date: 2017-03-24 15:10:52

@_date: 2017-03-29 01:43:48
I didn't say they are closed source.
I said they have moved to a closed source model, which is different.
They seem to be doing their development offline, scared to show their changes (they did that for relatively quite a while prior to the last hotfix) and again their activity seems to be offline. This means no other eyes are peer reviewing their code other than in-house. This is a closed source dev model.
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:50:38
Looks really really dubious at this point. They're nowhere near pulling a HF *right now*, so why block people's funds?
Stay away from these cowboys.

Sadly nobody is providing with retail units at a reasonable price, which is really unfortunate. 
I thought 21.co planned to do so, but it seems like they just cannot compete. Bitmain provides appalling yield for the price, without even accounting for electricity costs which are massive. The alternatives are even worse. With the added bonus of financing a huge central miner with dubious motives, by buying their overpriced hardware.
Seems like they have a proper stronghold because nobody is competing.

Maybe, but he was a thundercunt already when he was a nobody, so it's definitely not just that - even if that is very possible to have happened by now.
He exhibited psychopathic behaviour from the get-go.
However I wouldn't obsess about him or the Chinese miner clique - although it's a pressing issue. The reality is that we were already screwed when the HK meeting even happened. It's proof that mining is broken beyond superficial repair and it has been for a while. We may want to kick the can down the road but then the issue will come back and it will come back soon.

Making connectivity "tweaks" (which weaken the network, if needed globally) sure we can make 8MB happen. 
I wouldn't just start doing crazy stuff like that. For starters people refuse to node a node SO strained for zero compensation. That would need fixing. Your connection perma-crocked for zero benefit? textbook tragedy of the commons.

I give credence to the possibility of direct or indirect control of a 51% attack-capable concentration of mining. I've been hearing speculation about this from many different sources and not just recently.
Pools look engineered to appear balanced. So at least some of them may be. If you add up the clear agreement they have among some of them about everything, the suspicion becomes even more credible.
The possibility is enough to warrant a contingency plan.

Also, there is no such thing as a PoS nature in this.
PoS simply doesn't work like PoW and several of its problems remain unsolved. PoW continues solving the consensus problem, which PoS simply doesn't.

What constitutes a 51% attack or new rules is politics. If the majority of the hashing stably defends a set of rules *for them*, these are the new rules *for them* and you are the one forking out.

@_date: 2017-03-20 12:46:51
It does make a practical difference though.
It's also incorrect to assume a memory-heavy cryptohash would lead to more expensive research and a smaller amount of companies getting these ASICs. They are comparatively simple problems to solve by hardware, but the cost per unit is higher because of the amount of memory/silicon required. It would not make the barrier of entry any more expensive. It simply gives them lower margin compared to more generic MMP hardware like appropriate GPUs and FPGAs, which would give us more time.
I think this time around, unless price drops very significantly, we can expect very quick development of ASICs if the PoW is ASIC-friendly enough.

@_date: 2017-03-04 13:37:45
The reward for low enough fees can be negative, as filling the blocks increases the probability of getting it orphaned.
It depends on your connection, but it can be the case that for some miners that 10%-20% is not worth it. Also, relatively few transactions account for most of that 10%-20%, so making smaller blocks - not necessarily completely empty - may make sense for some.
Fees need to account for much more before not filling the blocks becomes a serious competitive disadvantage. This could happen quickly with LN.

There is no such this as "a UASF". UASF is a concrete modification of BIP9, not a generic thing about "users" and "activation" of SFs like its name seems to imply.
The name itself is deceiving, since it claims to be a generic thing when it's something very concrete.


That is a flag time block activation. It's something real and concrete which isn't what UASF does. UASF applies this under a certain mechanism that cannot be ignored.
So they are not the same thing and the difference is massive.


I haven't said anything of the sort, not sure where did you get that from. What I'm talking about is the potential implications in the network if nodes start blocking certain nodes from propagation in unpredictable ways.
The code of the UASF PR is very simple. The implications are potentially very complex.
Again, don't understand UASF for what its name seems to imply because it's NOTHING like that.
EDIT to add:


It is however not a protocol level verifiable measure. Using it like it were is deceiving.

I'm aware, I'm just covering that base in advance. The point you made I replied to here:




And the rest is justification as to why I don't recommend you run some of the "popular" alternatives.


Do you realise there are already 6-7 decent alternative implementations in several languages? What we need is people running nodes, which apparently not many care about other than old-timers used to Core + a few in others. It's quite telling if you think about it. There's also the cost of running a node precisely because of the already pretty crippling size of blocks which I personally experience and which wrecks my fibre home connection most of the day.
I hope this is an acceptable justification of the previous post, apologies if I wasn't explicit enough.
EDIT: by the way, Core has been porting to C++11 recently and I believe this is mostly complete.

I'm sorry if you think I was condescending or something like that. Trying to explain briefly only (should be sleeping).
I'm just struggling to understand how is it a bad thing that Bitcoin is maturing and business cases than make sense are crowding out gimmicks that make zero sense (as you conceded above). Nobody uses ETH, and there is significant subsidy still, plus dumb money coming in, so you can afford to do all sort of nonsensical stuff. Like you could in Bitcoin earlier on. For me this is a fantastic sign actually, although still there are many challenges to overcome.
If I'm missing your point please elaborate because I'm lost with what I get from the one-liners.

The other exchanges have explicitly listed clear preconditions and consequences, far beyond naming.
BTU won't be listed if there are replay attacks.
BTU won't be listed if there is no 2-way replay protection in place (essentially forcing them to hard fork formally as an alt).
BTC will continue under its ticker regardless of chain length.
All that goes beyond naming. Naming is the least important of it, technically speaking. Although it does set the tone clearly for everyone.
If Coinbase lists BTU/BTC-u in circumstances where the rest of the major exchanges won't, they are fucked. They would be cross-traded out of pocket.

I'm against two fundamental parts of the 1-2 proposals:
- Distinguishing SFs from HFs. One can pretty much do anything in a SF.
- The possibility of automatically passing to ACTIVE on flag day will potentially destroy the proposal process, since any moderately controversial SFs will need to be stopped before PRE_LOCK_IN, in the proposal process. This would understandably put into question the legitimacy of the repo maintainers to make such protocol-changing decisions.
Proposal three I believe is worth considering though. Meaning: just SegWit and upon developer agreement. It's a bit of a nuclear option though. Should probably also discuss the possibility of doing it as a HF and with a change of PoW. Because if we're going nuclear, we need to make sure we win.
This completely changes my outlook in terms of presentation, for the better.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:30:10
They're not very hidden.
@_date: 2017-03-22 05:52:20
In theory, but that depends slightly because they seem willing to go the suicide bomber's route.
So far, I've seen them several times flat-out refusing to do the provisions asked by the exchanges (2-way replay attack protection, wipeout protection) and they say Core must do it instead.
It may be necessary that Core actively forks instead to guarantee a cleaner split. But exchanges will need to still support assigning BTC to Core's codebase even in that case, or in the nuclear option of the PoW change because it's plausible that they will even attack.
I don't know if businesses will have what it takes to go this far.
Otherwise, we can have a complete clusterfuck of a split and it will be potentially very damaging for everybody. Their bluff is going to the end with this, and I don't doubt they are mentally unstable enough to go ahead. 
EDIT: if you want to see their attitude, you can check here  (don't miss the irony in Brian Armstrong asking Core for help because he doesn't trust them to do it properly... but he wants the BU lot he doesn't trust to take care of Bitcoin development)
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:14:57
Because increasing max blocksize without the provisions provided by SegWit is irresponsible. Core won't be bullied into making reckless engineering decisions as a compromise to appease the skeleton crew.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:09:17


That's a good question.
I believe the choice of PoW actually matters because there are properties that make some hardware that is commonly available relatively efficient at them, while making specialised hardware *not astronomically more efficient in any case* (although you can always improve with hardware optimisation). This does help both in initial distribution and in making altruist mining not a completely pointless thing to do for a significant amount of time.
But for me the killer feature of the change: the clear message that brazen collusion won't be tolerated again, and that they will also be looked upon with suspicion if they don't make part of their hashing available to the common public while amassing great shares of global hashing. Because that could provoke another PoW change in the future.
Preferably, I'd want a progressive PoWC that will allow miners to recoup on investment and move to the next PoW. But if they continue with their current attack threat they will force a sudden one.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:25:04

Obviously if you are not going to do anything else, or you cannot do much else, then it's something. But it's so little that I can hardly ask anyone to splash significant money at a loss for it.

At the time, it was reliable. Gavin actually coordinated it with the miners so they installed the software rather than simply spoofing it.
That's why signalling needs to be generous with its %s. As you say, many people can be signalling without actually doing the verification. For instance Slush famously lets individual miners choose what they announce without actually running the client software being announced in most cases.
Eventually you don't want ANY forks to automatically happen, even with signalling. These are temporary patches. I don't see a reliable way to roll out *generic* forks currently. Script versioning will allow a for a reliable way to version up the script. But ideally we will stop forking to *arbitrary consensus rules* at some point.

Not sure it's really worth it for TestNet but you can try testnet3 and have a look at SegWit and LN. Running multiple nodes in the same chain from the same connection is not a good idea (you're basically faking extra nodes and making your latency worse in the process).
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:23:03
But that is a runtime parameter (in theory, because so far I'm convinced most of them run Core spoofed).
So you have to assume that under sufficient hashrate they are coordinating for an attack, and they are doing so through open signalling. Effectively an attack on hold unleashing at any moment.

I'm an old timer as well. Seems like this is not a guarantee for agreement on deep divides with respect to the direction Bitcoin should take in the future. Some deeply philosophical ones even.
At this point and after years of fundamental disagreement, I think there is no other way out than a split and let's try to make it as clean and definitive as possible.
The arguments for "EC" and those carrying from Classic/XT make me sick to my stomach at this point, and I believe this to be the case for an increasing number of people from "either side", so there is zero chance we will coexist in the same chain.

It's not so easy. ETC coins are partially compatible with ETH (older coins) so as long as this is significative the split is not clear and this will depress the price of the compatible coin. There's also exchange support to consider the marketability of the coin.
The market of these coins will continue fluctuating if there's continued development on both sides.

If that was the only thing to happen I'd be celebrating so hard. But no, a network split could cause substantial havoc in the whole community.


Possibly, but if a large percentage of the network is actually not validating SegWit and it gets activated, we could have a split attack by one of the rogue miners wilfully creating an invalid SegWit transaction. I wouldn't put it past them. There are ways to profit substantially from engineering such a thing.


Sadly there's plenty of downside to making new attacks possible.

They would be a much better actor if not coordinated. When they are few and coordinated this clearly breaks the assumptions for trustlessness made in Bitcoin's Whitepaper.
The best single actor: not an actor that should self-proclaim itself as the only actor by forcibly taking power for itself.
Miners are colluding to protect their interests against the interest of the rest of the community. The real, technical problem about this is that they are centralised enough to be able to do that.
I'm pretty sure you cannot ignore this and just say: "but from the possible Central Managers, they are the best ones" - we don't want any.

If it was just balancing these numbers then it would actually be a good idea to have very quick blocks.
The main reason it's a stupid idea is that many networking assumptions break at these short intervals. Suddenly latency matters a lot, as do artefacts in the gossiping protocol. Access to a trusted, central network becomes a huge advantage. In general, a lot of assumptions just cannot be made anymore.

Completely misleading. Block rewards include transaction fees.

For everyone who isn't paying? That's correct.


A service fully subsidised on VC money and with very dubious long term sustainability.
If I wanted StorJ to stay below market price for marketing reasons, I'd offer to pay part of their fees and rally others to do the same. My home connection is under quite a bit of strain, which suggests probably it wouldn't sustain 8MB blocks nor anywhere near.
If every time VC bubbles give up free stuff we have to compete with real BTC and resources, we're going to shit. Every cycle they burn industrial amounts of money.

As much as I'd like to force SegWit, this is likely to fail and it could be pretty disastrous if there's a split. I'd go for it if there couldn't be a split at the logical level, but this isn't the case with SegWit. Let alone setting this mechanism so that ANY potential SF simply gets proposed and potentially approved on a deadline without PoW or any hard measure of consensus. A departure from using PoW as the trigger for any consensus decision is a pretty massive change.
I think there is no need to rush things so much.

@_date: 2017-03-20 11:49:57
This is a difficult issue, and it should probably be polled with the exchanges.
Solutions 2 and 3 would see us surviving precariously in some scenarios. And for these scenarios to be possible, very few people need to agree to attack Bitcoin. It also would mean we diverge from consensus and this makes a political difference. I'd discard 2 and 3 just like I'd discard 1 which leaves the network open to massive risks.
Solution 4 in the event of an attack seems like the way to go, but doing it through a SF should also be discussed.
With the backing of the community, 4 seems like a done deal to me. But maybe to achieve this backing, compromising to a SF will be necessary. Under an active attack, I cannot see anyone (except the usual bunch obviously) opposing 4 as it would be the only realistic effective protection. I can imagine other provisions to orphan anomalous blocks and blocks signalling BU/BIP101 but they are complex and game-able over the long term.

That WON'T do it. The only threat is not getting listed. While Erik has also told them that if they keep their attack for long enough and succeed then they will be BTC.
That's almost FORCING them to go all-out, and that's also Jihad's character. So it's pretty crazy if you ask me.
Anything other than supporting a Core strategy that will be OVERWHELMING against a hash attack would do it if it gets to that. Prior to that, there may be less radical fork solutions you can support

Yep, but since this threat seems credible and has been actually made, then suddenly we are talking about it? (Luke, Todd, you IIRC, and I think I'm forgetting one or two well-known Core contributors...) right?
I think the standard response is now very relevant. I'm afraid that if BU (+ spoofers) get to a dangerous level, and at the same time they refuse to make any provisions for replay attacks, etc... then isn't this contingency almost mandatory?

That happens to be conjecture, and many of us see a path outside of both limitations that is credible (Core's roadmap essentially, but really it's the most common way to sort network scalability problems: layers and federation).


It 1AM so probably not today, but a small number or nodes leads to a The Pirate Bay / Megaupload situation (raids) or an NXT/BitcoinXT situation (DDoS targetting a small number of nodes takes log(N-i) resources). There are many other possible scenarios of fragility due to small number of nodes, but these are very tangible.

Nah, to a certain extent services do need to upgrade (usually by simply upgrading their Core node if they use it). Or else they're unable to deal with part of the economy using SegWit. They're unable to see if some of the balances are correct or not, which limits their scope and as soon as SegWit is significant at all it would be a deal breaker for most users.

You need your own people to do that. You cannot refuse to split if it's to force people to work against their ideals and values. It's just not going to happen, okay? See the post above by Peter R.

This is so crazy I’m sure many Core developers haven’t fully internalised it. They (BU, and apparently people like tou) want to make them their slaves and they don’t want to negotiate any other outcome. That is a pretty damn clear non-starter.

This is a strong American bias.
People here love criticising Chinese cultural biases. The Chinese love unanimity and competition is often seen as dissent and it's "unprofessional" for them. This is their weakness when approaching certain market problems.
However Americans have this bias that every alternative "deserves" equal treatment, or else you are being unfair. You cannot say something is stupid, wrong or simply does not work. Because this is "toxic", or it's "negative". Ask Linus Torvalds how does it feel when someone merges a change that breaks user-space and tries to argue it's someone else's fault (even if it is). There is no neutrality about what the currency in my bank is. If my bank declares itself "neutral" about my balance being British Pounds or Zimbabwean Dollars, this is not a comforting statement. I take my money the fuck out of it. Keep your coins in Coinbase at your own peril.
Every American VC will come out with this sort of narrative, it's sort of amusing. Circle did. Bitpay did. Coinbase did. Andresen and Garzik are obsessed with "middle grounds" and the idea that Bitcoin is just an open source repository that benefits from incompatible parallel versioning. That's why VC money has been typically so *toxic* for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is about reality, and reality is cruel and has no respect for incompetence and failure. Bitcoin cannot afford to evolve through trial and failure. It's mission-critical software, not Flappy Bird. 
If you make Bitcoin about compromise, democracy and alternatives, then it cannot be money and it cannot be gold. These concepts are unforgiving. They don't negotiate and they are not half in point A and half in point B. If you make consensus rules a democracy, it's game over decentralised currency. Might as well go full Vitalik and have a supreme decider of which one is the correct chain and what the rules are.
I agree with Brian Armstrong that these sort of statements are gemerally not a good idea, unless they are to clarify what is what in the market. But then he just released a letter which is a statement, and failed to clarify anything whatsoever.

I meant consistent behaviour from the supposedly irrational actors. In this case, BU signalling miners and possibly more miners because as it stands, the majority doesn't support SegWit (or doesn't signal readiness, to be precise, but we are left to wonder why).


Gavin contacted the main pool operators. It was more than sufficient.
Plus, there was no other game in town. At the time, whatever the "lead dev of Core" said flied, because your alternative was to be left with an unsupported older version that nobody could touch with a 10 ft pole. That made it impossible to organise a resistance. Oh, and at the time miners didn't have the "communication channels" they have now. Nowhere near. They were mostly each and their own, and there was no Chinese contingent of close-knit miners, etc. That just didn't exist at the time. It was A LOT easier back then. They had no alternative. It was like it's now in a minor alt, whatever the leading devs say goes, full stop. 


Very minor. Nothing voluntary like could happen now. That has NEVER really ben a realistic scenario, until now if we do lose our minds and go ahead without miner support.


"People". Sorry but that doesn't work in the protocol. You'd need complete unanimity from the economic actors to really twist their hand (individual node operators and holders matter fuck-all for this, being realistic) and that is as unlikely if not more than say 90% of the hashing power.
If there was such unanimity they wouldn't even dare pronounce themselves like they do. There just isn't. In fact twats like Brian Armstrong are with them fully.

I have no idea where did you get that impression from any of the UASF proposals. None of them have anything to do with the actual consensus in terms of the blockchain transactions. They are punctual solutions to implement protocol upgrades. There is no PoS in any imaginable way. Stake has nothing to do with it. However the support of certain economic parties might force the hand of miners to support the upgrade or not. But that is not "stake" or "proof of stake" and it doesn't alter the ledger.
There is no nothing at stake problem here any way you look at it, because it's proof of work. In PoW, the energy burnt cannot be replicated. A miner loses all the energy spent in the losing chain without the possibility of ever having it back.
Replay attacks though, that's a different story. If the split left the economic winner with less hashing than the other (a scenario considered unrealistic, but theoretically possible) then replay attacks could happen. Many hashing based attacks could happen. There is no hiding from having less hashing than the attacker. Either a checkpoint or a PoW change would have to happen, and that would be a huge hit.
@_date: 2017-03-20 13:55:00

In this space love and hate mean fuck-all. There is relative trust and healthy suspicion. If Bitfury and the rest of the makers don't allow for the re-decentralisation of SHA-256, then we will seriously need to put a PoW change in the table, and really soon.
So they need to move, if they know what's best for them.

This is how I saw it:
He pushed his paper, and I read it. I thought it was interesting and made good points about the balances in mining. It obviously ignored any sort of guarantees or balance for the number of nodes. nullc (IIRC, but could have been maaku) immediately got pretty incensed because of that. I didn't understand why and I thought it was overblown - I wasn't aware of the agenda that apparently was breeding just around that time, I thought it was simply a genuine omission.
Boy was I wrong. Soon after, his rants started gaining momentum. By the time of the conference I was actually a bit worried that he'd do something cringeworthy or get worked up. And did he fucking do. It's been ranting full on ever since, and doing 99% politics 1% cringey powerpoints with references to "block the stream" and stuff like that.

If you want to diversify, diversify in stuff that doesn't have an enormous correlation with Bitcoin. Like in gold, or in foreign currency for instance. Diversifying in something that generally goes down even harder when Bitcoin goes down, means you are not an investor, you are not a cypher punk, you are not a zealot: you are just an idiot.


Not a bad thing per se. It's one risk strategy. What is very morally questionable, is having a stake and a say in Bitcoin businesses, and engineering crises to speculate on BTC and alts. But we are talking about someone who still doesn't admit to have endorsed MtGox, and who thinks regulation on sale of unmarked explosives and its storage infringes on his "freedom". A criminal with a completely warped sense of morality.

It would be definitely for no technical reason. Slightly increasing the max blocksize would solve no problem. Increasing it strongly would introduce very real problems and would never reach consensus.
There is a very strong technical reason to keep 1MB instead of 1.5MB. Keeping 1MB requires no fork and no consensus. Having said that I'd much prefer 800KB. Not reducing the cap for me is a compromise. Any floating cap should IMO allow for reductions as well, like Luke proposed. Introducing a floating cap that has a hard floor at 1MB means big blockers have made zero compromise. I'd much rather keep it as is. 
The fact that some want to force a hard fork in order to allow for SegWit is also a zero compromise stance, it's actually worse: it's forcing a different issue in the conversation, not content with zero compromise.
History proves you cannot currently manufacture a consensus for ANY blocksize cap increase at this point. It's just not there. So we just wait and hopefully the miner ecosystem will progressively change.
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:38:38
If you were to do that, then I would approach it differently. UASF applies to ANY softfork that simply gets proposed.
I'd make SegWit a hardfork and set an activation date, then roll on the next version of Core without the option of deactivating it. That is pretty nuclear, and even that is more sensible than UASF as currently defined IMO.

There might be indeed a misunderstanding because I don't see how it enforces anything if not by suppressing certain blocks to a certain degree. I mean, what people are describing in posts and what I read in the proposal seem completely unrelated.
If the threshold for versionbits remains at 95%, softfork parameter extension or not it won't happen without an overwhelming majority of mining power and what people are saying about nodes vs miners makes no sense.

There's a BIP for a blocksize increase to 2MB with some basic provisions for the transition (BIP 102). 
There's no BIP that couples together SegWit SF and a basic increase to 2MB without allowing to first properly transition to SegWit.
This was rejected by the HK clique, like everything else.
Note that BIP 102 simply doubles the SIGOPS allowed ignoring the fact that, prior to SegWit's provisions, validation is *currently known* to be O(SIGOP**2)  (quadratic to SIGOP number). It would be linear soon after SegWit.

Miners cannot be forced to include transactions, so they cannot be bypassed. You either pay now or you pay later. Other than that, there's only competition between miners.

(Full) nodes *also* verify transactions and may not relay them. The main purpose of miners is creating blocks and picking which transactions go in them. That is more than just verifying transactions or relaying them (which miners also do).

OP just pointed this out in the short message he posted:


Indeed not their fault that they won. Entirely their fault that their short-term strategy endangers the whole environment they rely upon.
ASICMiner back in the day realised they needed to maintain a real balance between in-house and retail sales to never grow dangerously. Bitmain got greedy and gave zero fucks about it, or even about the blocks they create:  (archive  )

I understand money just fine. Silver is no complement to gold as a store of value. Silver is a different store of value. Bitcoin doesn't need a silver for any reason. It's divisible down to 8 decimal places without any modifications, could be divided even further. As a vehicle, any alt can do whatever LTC does - but the ideal would be L2 chains.

Ok, so you don't understand what L1 intends to achieve.
The txs at L0 need to be gossiped to the whole Bitcoin node network. This is extremely costly in terms of bandwidth and this bandwidth usage cannot be lowered without compromising safety and decentralisation. Space in the block needs to reflect this cost. If the cost is low over the long term, so is the safety/security of the network.
L1 on the other hand does not have these constraints. Individual txs at L1 don't need to be gossiped to or persisted in every Bitcoin node. That depends on what particular chain you are using at L1. These can have different trade-offs in terms of throughput, cost and security. But you cannot build secure on top of insecure, so L0 needs to remain strictly secure.
Unlimited block size at L0 means Bitcoin becomes pointless because it cannot possibly compete in throughput/price with centralised solutions and you are losing the features Bitcoin does have (decentralisation and censorship-resistance).
L0 and L1 are not exchangeable. L0 is Bitcoin. L1 requires *some* space to operate upon, so it cannot be zero (although it can be relatively little). L1 entities would need to be able to transact on L0 to operate.
Everybody would be able to operate on L0 directly, but they will need to pay whatever it costs at that point.

All of that depends on getting SegWit out of this deadlock. So, entirely related with the BU cartel.

UASF, as far as I've read in the posts here, works essentially like a coordinated network "eclipse attack". These have been always possible, so long as enough supporters join them and nodes in the other side of the consensus are not connected enough (which many aren't because with 1MB full blocks, most people already cannot afford many connections).
Paradoxically, the bigger the blocks the more likely is that eclipse attacks work with a lesser majority. Having a blocksize limit works in favour of the minority in such coordinated network actions.
I find it strange that some of the same people discouraging node operators from setting custom block relay rules, are now advocating for this which is the same but with much stronger effect (coordinated). Unless I'm misunderstanding the proposed procedure.

You can get an older gen BitMain, an Avalon or a Spondoolies. Even an ASICMiner Block Erupter but these are even much more pointless by now (I have two of these still lying around).
The ballpark of the loss is $1500-$2000 or so. The lower you go the more pointless and negligible your hashing will be.
If you want to donate into hashing at a loss, probably your best bet is cloud mining. Less hassle and less money lost for the same amount hashing.
If you want a shot at recovering your investment, you can get a container solution from Bitfury. Obviously we're talking of a big investment here and you will need serious infrastructure somewhere with very cheap electricity or you can only expect to lose big.

How so? I mean, firstly the economic majority is not node operators nor miners nor any network or consensus actor, and is nearly impossible to query. But leaving that aside, version bits are set by miners and miners alone. You need to set these first so the relay rules have any effect.


That's fine but if you need 95% anyway, it won't make much of a difference. Yeah, as a process it makes sense to add it into the versionbits mechanism and have full nodes not relay it, but that doesn't change the fact that miners set it. Also, as you said, you can always Sybil nodes and ignore this rule. To no avail because at that point there would be an overwhelming majority of SegWit blocks and it would be completely established. It essentially removes the opt-in nature of the softfork but that's it. It won't make it happen by itself any more likely.

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:02:16
There are limitations to that.
But we're talking about RETAIL. Putting a high barrier of entry definitely shrinks the total market size of the thing. Their availability is extremely limited to a relatively small amount of people and businesses. This makes a difference in decentralisation.
When OP says "sell to us" he doesn't mean "sell to us millionaires" or "sell to us corporations". I think that's clear from context.
When ASICMiner and Avalon sold profitable miners that were accessible to the lower-middle class, things were a lot better in terms of mining centralisation. Now most hashing is in the hands of a very small few.
It's their decision, but this collective failure to care for their environment may cost them.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:48:10

If they didn't block it we'd be using it already and we'd be having larger block capacity right away. And L2 would be around the corner.

P2SH transactions don't create a "P2SH" block. Cannot be accepted unwittingly by non-P2SH-supporting nodes or miners regardless of validity like happens with SegWit.
If, at the time of P2SH introduction, the majority of miners didn't support it and someone fooled them into accepting an invalid transaction we could have had a serious split. That's why it was done with an overwhelming majority of the hashrate behind rather than hoping a potential split didn't happen.
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:52:08


That is irrelevant. We wouldn't be able to tell which SFs are being run by which nodes. We would also need to police the very proposition of SFs because they would all get automatically approved after their flag day. This destroys the whole process of proposing SFs.


I'm too furious about your wilful ignorance of the whole mechanism that UASF - the concrete PR - carries out and its extremely dangerous implications. So I sort of needed a small break.
If someone like you, with knowledge of the protocol and the source code, can be bamboozled by these obvious propagandistic techniques of misrepresentation, what will it do with the average Joe?
I also didn't want to mix up completely different issues.


That is correct, and these have nothing to do with UASF. So using the term to justify it is just deceiving the public.


You start by defending the label UASF - which is a concrete PR. What you are doing is very dangerous.
But now on to your message of this possible battle at the "economic space" - note that this is NOT about UASF and that UASF is a completely different thing - sorry to reiterate.
I don't completely disagree with that possible nuclear option. I'd rate it alongside the option of switching PoWs. Something that is completely undesirable and dangerous but would have to be considered if there is absolutely no way to make progress.
IMO, it assumes very unrealistic scenarios even if you ignore the wrongful use of the term UASF, because several major exchanges are fully in bed with Ver et all. Very importantly Coinbase. I'm afraid they might actually have the upper hand if push comes to shove, we'd have to play Russian roulette with that possibility if we go there. 
That sort of userspace fork and battle for the Bitcoin brand would be extremely destructive for the whole space. I wouldn't rule out Bitcoin losing hegemony in the crypto space if we go there, something I haven't seriously considered before. But your pushing of this might change my mind if you succeed.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:44:06
That would be a general case of compromising SHA256.
It's only compromised for the purposes of Nakamoto Consensus, which relies on no parties being able to cooperate to control the majority of global hashing power. Otherwise you have to TRUST that party and your system is no longer trust-less, which is the main point of the whole thing.
See 
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:46:57
Your use-case relies on regulators simply not having caught up and has no long-term future. Sorry to drop it like this.
You are using a system that is more costly and complex to do something that can be done with another much simpler system. But they happen to be heavily taxed and regulated already, and that creates an opportunity. But be damn sure that it won't stay under the radar if it grows.
Regulatory whack-a-mole is early-stage Bitcoin use cases. Regulators catch up and the reality that you are doing the exact same thing with a more expensive system imposes itself (once the tax/regulation advantage disappears).
To be proper regulatory arbitrage longer term, the famous three are strictly necessary or it will get stopped: decentralised, censorship-resistant, distributed transaction system. That was the point all along.
Your system will only have survival chances over the longer term in these circumstances, and not under the current limitations.

I think it has hurt the case. In any situation, we'd have a stronger case for actually doing what the document says. Although if I had to bet, no, I don't think they'd concede anyway but they'd look even crazier and it would have costed them a degree of support.


Imagine they did. Evorhees would have still wrecked it by coming out and saying he made a mistake and he had not read the final version.
After all this is the effective impact this has caused. You may think it's negligible, I disagree.
BU are suffering public backlash but their loyalists are there and their hash attack threat is still mounting.
So, what to do now? how do you enforce that document? Other than by coming out backing a Core HF or something like that. This can be a pretty dangerous rise of stakes.
Does this mean this post from today (yesterday in my timezone) means nothing? No, I appreciate it. But it doesn't undo the damage in my opinion.
EDIT: oh, and saying that you will change your mind if they keep their hash advantage for long enough and BU will be BTC, is a clear, transparent invitation for them to try this attack. This is trivial from the game-theoretical PoV and if you don't see it, I despair.

Fundamentally, soft forks are no better or worse than hard forks. It depends on the implications of the fork entirely.
This A good B bad is just simplistic nonsense.
The difference in the case of SegWit is that the transition can be expected to be smoother as a SF, because attacking it would have a larger opportunity cost compared to a HF.

It's pointless to complement gold as a store of value. Silver competes with gold in that function, if anything.

@_date: 2017-03-30 13:02:01
That is not the only way BTU may fork. In fact, not even with 75% support there's any code in place that will make bigger blocks as things stand.
For instance:
- An UASF of SegWit can also provoke a split.
- BTU providing the replay-attack and wipeout protections they were asked to provide, may also come with provisions for a split (like a checkpoint for instance)
BTU right now is nothing but "an idea" - a string in coinbase script without any code backing it up in any client. I also assumed there was some mechanism of some sort, until recently, but there isn't. It does nothing. BTU can split the moment they just decide to do it and anything near 50% of hashing makes it quite feasible from the practical point of view. The question is whether they will go ahead or not.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:44:35
I think this is, among other reasons, why a progressive phasing out is desirable.
 See: 
That way we'd preclude spin-offs and have a path to retain the overwhelmingly biggest hashrate protection of any crypto.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:57:57
For what you actually want to achieve, Core's roadmap makes a tonne more sense. It's not obvious on surface, but they have thought this through as much or more than anybody else - sorry to use this argument to authority but I cannot just reproduce everything in a reddit post.

Just a possible strategy to get rid of that shitshow. It's actually worth considering.

And many in the community think it's an acceptable situation that miners demand their business to be protected (even if misguidedly so in this instance) at the protocol level, and by making developers brazenly collude with them.

Blocksize increase will only be accepted by any competent developer team once the provisions are in place to transition with guarantees.

A vanilla blocksize increase prior to these changes poses known risks that won't be willingly taken by competent devs.

"People" ask for many things at the same time. I personally think they didn't provide healthy enough of a tomato, rather than the other way around.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:48:30
I think you might be missing the point yourself (or maybe the point of your ASICs which you don't want to use as floor heaters). Because one of the main purposes of Bitcoin is trustlessness, and this is compromised by the allocation of that hashing power "controlled by cooperating nodes" using Satoshi's Whitepaper vocabulary. So it has nothing to do with my opinion or disagreement on what they are doing, but with the fact that they indeed cooperate (strong sufficient condition for trustlessness being compromised) although it would be enough that they *could reasonably cooperate by virtue of their insufficient decentralisation* (weak sufficient condition for  trustlessness being compromised).
It's quite clear that a lopsided enough distribution of the global hashrate for a specific cryptohash breaks the provisions made in the paper for trustlessness. Now one could argue exactly how much centralisation is acceptable, but when 5 dudes get in a room and demand conditions on the protocol, threatening network attacks otherwise, then it's entirely clear we have crossed the line of what was acceptable long ago. Call it what you want, but this actually only happens for SHA256 and nothing else, and it's an artifact of Bitcoin. Therefore, SHA256 hashing for Bitcoin is compromised, and the concrete meaning of "compromised" in that sense is perfectly understandable and consistent with the dictionary definition of the word.
PS: probably other hashes have this problem of having exclusive hardware very strongly centralised under cooperating parties
PS2: of course other hashes are more generally compromised and not only for the purpose of trustlessness in Nakamoto Consensus (to varying degrees) 
PS3: in fact there is a very wide spectrum of properties for which concrete cryptohashes can be compromised. To collision, to chosen-prefix collision, to preimage attacks, etc. So many hashes are compromised for some things and not for other things, in surprisingly varied combinations. So, in any case, being compromised is almost always a spectrum except for those that have zero known vulnerabilities. Very few have actually been compromised for essentially all purposes. Even MD2 which is weak vs preimage attacks for many years is interestingly quite strong against birthday collision attacks which are typically easier on other *compromised* hashes.

Yep... an immediate switch makes a lot more sense under attack.
A progressive one must be considered regardless to correct the current situation, which is ridiculous. A bunch of dudes meeting in HK demanding conditions so they don't attack the network. If that was even possible, mining is broken.
@_date: 2017-03-21 02:23:32
It actually could be a lot more decentralised like in the past and this wouldn't be happening.
So in a way he's responsible for opening the community's eyes to something often dismissed as abstract and far-fetched by making it real and concrete: a cartel of big miners attacking the network.
Re-decentralising hashing is now on the table. Now the question is, do they want a sudden one in response to their mounting attack, or a progressive one that will allow them to recoup investments. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:42:23
For starters, just increasing the blocksize with no further changes, other than being incompetent because of the repercussions, would not be a HF. It'd be a SF.
Your line above has nothing to do with the actual statement. "The exchange announcement is indicating HF to be increasingly likely" is just a fear-inducing message with no actual decisive content.

UASF is nowhere near to getting into Core. Thankfully. But that's a different topic.
In a current Core node, it isn't really a vote. But as I said, it does help the network, plus you can monitor your own transactions without trusting a third party node.

This one Meni just passed to me was very good and conveyed very well my point of view at the time (and to a large extent now, although I think the difference now is that the bigblocker side lost the plot and degenerated... so they no longer have a case like they used to, but the underlying debate could have been had otherwise).
This message from today: 
...and the previous ones in that thread sort of summarise my current concerns. BTU is not debatable IMO. XT wasn't either. Classic could have been, but now it's lagging and took several crazy ideas from the others. On top of that they are ultimately incompatible. In short, I hope Core's roadmap works as I think it can work, because having a proper stable alternative so each tries their best and maybe if one fails the other may succeed... I think that evolutionary scenario is dead and dusted.

I think we should eventually go to war with them to be honest. Doesn't sound great, but the system is broken right now. The current centralisation clearly violates the assumptions for stability and resilience from the original whitepaper, which remain true.
Transitioning to a different PoW should be a plan, no matter what. Obviously, their attitude increases the urgency of doing it. But anyway it doesn't seem like hashing will spontaneously re-decentralise and it will become even a larger problem.


Hehehe you made me smile there.

That's right, but show me that unanimous support because I don't see it. Support not as in "compatibility" but as in "we will stay in your chain even if there is a longer one that beats you on hashing".
If Brian Armstrong et al don't jump into Ver's bed I'll be surprised.
And even so, it would be very precarious to run like this unless the adversarial miners don't show clear signs to join and stop future attacks.

I actually think Coinbase's statement is not unreasonable. But after the joint statement, it's untenable. They have to coordinate with the rest of the exchanges regarding when/how to list BTU, or else they will be wiped out.
@_date: 2017-03-16 05:13:09
That's pretty optimistic, but ok. I'll believe it when I see it. I wouldn't try to just activate SegWit on a flag time block just yet though. And definitely not through a mechanism like UASF that would apply to anything.
If it's just tweaking the activation of SegWit then sure, I'm willing to hear about that.

@_date: 2017-03-18 19:25:25
But on the point of being contentious, any PoW change will be very contentious as it will shuffle power and the ones on top who are affected won't like it. You can ameliorate it somehow by making the switch progressive.
The thing is that contentious or not, the miners would not be able to stop it if the community gathers enough momentum and exchanges support it.

@_date: 2016-03-21 12:03:15
SegWit will eat up the chain with just activation (75%), since txs using SegWit will be much cheaper than those not using it. Even if XTassic hovered in the 5%-25% range of hashing share, the political pressure to fork them off would be pretty strong.
I'd love to see them try that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:38:11

That's a different topic though. He's right tax such a tax imposed regionally is ineffective and also counter-productive since the trade just moves. Financial transactions move very easily, unlike retail and other kinds of transactions where there is more friction.
@_date: 2016-03-16 23:19:24
I haven't looked at the code yet, but unless I'm missing something fake headers are prevented by virtue of hashPrevBlock and hashMerkleRoot being in the headers. You still have to produce a valid header hash and even if hashMerkleRoot is bogus, this doesn't save you any amount of work to produce the valid header hash. This work cannot be done in parallel with valid work so you are wasting 100% of your hashing on the hopes of making some miners waste 30 seconds every 10 minutes when you get superlucky. It's not a feasible attack.

Economic incentives may not be as simple as one would assume. Reasonability therefore may not be an Universal measure, because there is asymmetric information involved. Miners can edge their profits by controlled announcements. They seem to be doing just that. These things obviously have short-term effects and they cannot be ignored.

UASF is a chemical weapons attack on your neighbour. If you survive it, there's chances that you will suffer consequences over the long term.
If a majority hashing power cartel loses the economic war, they still have the assets to make the situation very precarious for the rest of us. They wouldn't be definitely defeated, we depend on some assumptions which we cannot guarantee.
In fact I think both should be ready in the arsenal. If chem doesn't end them, we need at least the threat of nukes.

Things believed by BU people:
- BU is production ready
- releasing unsigned binaries in a Bitcoin(/BTU) node-wallet is acceptable, provided we later show some source leaked by accident
- if we deal with two releases appallingly badly but differently, it means there is a double standard if you criticise both
- a team of economists and politicians will stand up against a team of engineers in maintaining a big C++ repository, and the one they themselves built at that
- if something is wrong in the code, even if Core works, it's Core's bug and writing rants about it with insulting critique to Core will make them look really smart
- putting jokes and political names in variables, obfuscating diff comparisons between their repo and Core even further, is a solid idea and will help back-port the fixes Core's team finds
- throwing resources at that rotting repository that has been corrupted over many moons is a sensible investment
- variants of similar technology made by Core and their much larger team are a good idea. Let's do thin blocks instead of compact, because X and Y told me it's better. And with this great record they must be right
- SegWit is bad, FlexTrans is good (see the point just above this one)
- Did I say SegWit is bad? I mean SegWit as SF is bad. It's good as a HF. I simultaneously defend this point and the previous, completely contradicting one. Even in the same post.
- Our nodes are crashing left and right, and right now there is a huge spike in visitors to the sub. Success!!! we are winning (literal)
- I restarted my crashed node with a hack put together in an unsigned binary, or through a flag that basically disables pointless bloat from my software -&gt; drama over, success!! we can go home proud
- LN is not working in the real world (thanks to our relentless boycott it's relegated to Testnet) - they have no solution. Glorious BU exists in the real world
- Our 4 part timers are overwhelmed with the complexity of the code repository. Let's start another fringe fork in Github
Obviously there are many, MANY more tropes, they are just too many to come up with all of them off the top of my head.

Firstly, these people are not too reasonable so let's not assume that.
Secondly, we haven't been in that situation where WE soft-fork away with the minority of the hashing power. That isn't going to fly whatever you think about which chain is the good one. We'd need to Vitalik the chain or switch PoW or something like that, or expect hashing attacks for an undetermined period of time left, right and centre.

I think the BotNet takeover model is overwhelmingly disproven by now. Mediocre hardware is much more effective in punctual network attacks than running obviously heavy and continuous PoW that will make itself obvious rather soon.
Memory heavy cryptohashing will run better in an ASIC, but not have the same magnitude of advantage on GPUs and MPP hardware. They wouldn't be hard to design or produce, just more expensive per unit making it a bit less attractive vs GPUs.
We have to just admit that the change cannot be guaranteed to stay watertight forever. We need a change that will work for the next 8-10 years, and any more than that would be a bonus.
GPU friendliness I think it's a reasonable compromise between wide availability and botnet resilience. We can even use Ethereum Classic's PoW.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:08:16




In such case we don't have an actual process to have them released. That is potentially stifling and you also have to consider that alternative implementations may also introduce a similar, compatible process. And have their potentially dangerous SFs activated with zero Core supervision. Then we don't know which nodes run what. And that would be actually fair.
So that's why I consider 1 and 2 strongly NACK'able.


They do control the proposal process, and the mechanism in proposals 1 and 2 would link one thing and the other.


I know, and it was pretty mediocre to be honest (excusable because nobody had any experience in doing this). Since miners were not constituted as a lobby back then, they had no way to resist a "protocol upgrade". Much easier it was than now, I'm afraid. They also had no alternative than either accepting it or stay in an unsupported branch. 
I'm not discussing that. UASF as a brand name needs to settle for a concrete proposal, because they have completely different implications.
A one-time flag day activation is one thing, which I think we should consider. Proposals 1 and 2 are different things altogether.
This text here is much better than what you posted in the ML in my opinion.

It is for the purposes of Bitcoin.
It's even described verbatim as such in the whitepaper, in the very conclusion:


And in the abstract:


The network relies on not having to trust anyone because nobody has a majority of hashing power. It's a very essential tenet of Bitcoin.
Since this computational power, for SHA256 specifically, is so concentrated, this breaks the main assumption of the system.

The situation is extreme already. We rely on trusting them not to attack, this violates the protocol's assumptions. To avoid this they could surrender their weapons (by making their equipment available at break-even price).

The alternative is having a racket of a few miners in cahoots with influential developers ruling the system in an absolutist way.
The economic effect is part of the balance. Nobody owes miners anything, if they didn't make this situation necessary it wouldn't happen. Earlier ASIC makers understood this problem and had a policy of selling more hashing capacity than they kept, and at reasonably profitable prices. This situation is the direct result of their greedy, short-term approach. Particularly that of Jihan who has repeatedly shown psychopathic behaviour in the past.

That is indeed the major roadblock to any HF.
Exchanges seem to happily accept this SF as no change of consensus, which politically is meaningful. With a HF I guess they would need to be lobbied and we'd find out. This is problematic because SFs really can do a whole lot of things (including a Rube Goldberg change of PoW via extension blocks or something like that).
That doesn't preclude the fact that there *must* be a mechanism to phase out a PoW if there is overwhelming justification for it (like, for instance, if it is cryptographically broken to the point blocks are solved under 10 minutes). Also quite importantly, the crypto of signatures could be broken some day in the distant future so a fundamental change like that must be possible.

Miners can signal support for anything they want. The vast majority of them don't support a blocksize cap increase. A few miners have capped their blocks to 750KB.
Currently 6% are signalling 8MB blocks, 2% are signalling BIP109. 16% explicitly signal 1MB (largest share of explicitly signalled blocksize cap by far) and 45%+ are signalling nothing, including not signalling SegWit.
And that's miners, in terms of the community you just cannot ignore there is no consensus regarding blocksize. The community is indubitably divided. Not opinion, reality.

I read the supposed removed line, and it implies they would all need to agree and be overwhelmingly clear. So it really sounds like a stretch that BU could possibly switch to be called BTC.
The other version of the statement doesn't make much practical difference to me. Of course, conspiracy theorists will hold on to that like it invalidates the other slightly different version. It really doesn't though. The rest of the statement is full of bombs vs BTU. There's just no denying that.

Macri started off with a promising outlook, removing restrictions on forex trading. But if he was going to cuck after that when the predictable adjustment happened, then he shouldn't have done it in the first place. Worst of both worlds, as now both the political class and large swathes of the population won't want forex and capital restrictions lifted.

That is a fascinating topic and a separate challenge.
However BU... doesn't even come close to bringing this to the front.
If you don't mind reading some subtitles (or if you can understand Hebrew) give this a good look:
It's from 1 year ago, at the peak of the Classic debate. Classic wasn't crazy back then *technically*, and I could concede that at the time just fine. I just preferred the Core roadmap and it looked more promising to me. Problem is, it has become crazy since and the alternatives are crazier and crazier every time (maybe because of frustration? - I can sympathise with that). But it is what it is.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:02:27
Nope, greed in the short term and greed in the long term often conflict. Companies failing to reconcile the two very often go out of business. It's one of the main reasons companies go out of business.
Completely taken care of by capitalism. Us reacting to the system being broken is part of capitalism as well.

@_date: 2017-03-27 13:22:46
Do you mean the reality or what they are selling?
The reality is this:
- working 2-layer solutions mean private payments that scale globally. That scares many people up top.
- some people are misguided and don't understand the Jevons Paradox (some big miners most importantly)
- some people believe the selling points below
What they sell is this:
- payment channels will be able to crowd out most transactions from layer 1 (meaning we actually succeed? but they don't believe these payments are any good apparently)
- "Satoshi's vision" is that we do everything in L1 like "buying coffees" (and hope for the best)
- [?] hard to even comprehend the logic of some of the arguments, they go like "Blockstream are evil", smart people want to impose their code on us, etc.

Actually I'm ok with that general idea. But not via UASF, because that just leaves us with the problem of having to find out consensus without PoW.
Switching PoW has to be an option, even if it's a nuclear option. If a majority of the miners co-opt Bitcoin in a way that is unacceptable for a majority of the users, then something's got to give.

@_date: 2017-03-13 15:35:27
That's correct, and that's why it secured 95% before activation.
Doing it with random miner support would have been as reckless as UASF (as currently defined).

Proposals 1 and 2 do indeed punish miners that don't switch. All 3 proposals do that.
But they are about a particular switching methodology (1 and 2) or just a particular switch (3). Other than that, miner power remains the same and so does miner reward.

@_date: 2017-03-22 15:10:30
I agree.
But command line sounds like it would need an amount of user coordination that seems dangerous.
I think a given number of super-slow blocks could automatically trigger it. Just a matter of tweaking the numbers.
It would also help to have a better retargeting function but obviously miners will oppose that too at this point.
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:20:55
Yep, "slow + (fast &amp; empty)" attacks like that plotted by Gavin need to be addressed. A number of empty or near empty blocks could be a trigger too.
But with all of that one has to be extremely careful, not to get unlucky and change PoW suddenly without attack.

@_date: 2017-03-17 12:41:36
The fact that miners are extremely concentrated and also unrepresentative of users is a fundamental problem. Communication won't sort that one out, we are at the mercy of the benevolence and reason-ability of a tiny few.
At this point we need to consider even the nuclear option of PoW change, resetting the distribution of mining and hoping it will last until the years of high block reward are over - feasible - so that the distribution will stay stable.
If they didn't push it this hard we wouldn't be considering this. But if you think about it it's a deeper problem even if they happen at some point to just act benevolently.

Literally I haven't seen a single block that votes BU and also SegWit, although this is perfectly possible. So, what does this tell you? The partition between these camps is perfect (or almost perfect) to the point it's clear BU people simply oppose SegWit and denying it is just mendacious.
There are blocks that explicitly signal for a concrete block size (sometimes alongside SegWit). The most popular by far is 1MB.

But then you need hide the requirement of PoW2 from older node software, using the coinbase trick or something like that. At this rate we'll have all the logic in coinbase and the rest of the block will be blank ;-)
You also need to specify how do these PoWs add up. I'd advocate for maximisation of the harmonic mean of both.

I don't think it will take a millionaire to buy this. Also, there's the option of joint ownership. Tiny miners are just not competitive now nor are they worth the hassle of connecting them and running a node - for most people. And if you outsource these parts of the operation, then you are not controlling your own hashing.

That's absolutely correct and I don't see what are you reading into that.
You are either running a node or relying on trust. On a flaky trust in the current environment. Luke and others have been rightly pointing this out since long, long ago.
@_date: 2017-03-18 03:02:24
How did it happen?
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:07:57
Not knowing that a transaction has not been malleated immediately means you cannot automatically attest for its validity, and this means you cannot use it as collateral for off-chain transactions in general, which includes sidechains, LN or any other L2 solution without risking it was malleated.
In practice this means you cannot off-load transactions from the blockchain automatically and/or immediately, making them essentially unfeasible.
I hope this helps clarify why malleability means any scalability not involving exponential global growth in costs (for bandwidth, full node storage and sigops) is off the table.
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:19:46
We haven't significantly changed our collective minds on roughly anything about the technical merits of BU/EC and what it entails. It was never acceptable and our opinion (certainly mine) is not based on hostility.
On other topics it has indeed changed. There are many individuals that I will never want to have anything to do with because of this issue and are blacklisted for all purposes in my personal sphere. But that has nothing to do with the issue.

Nope but it does something very nifty, which is detecting where the error is, if feasible.
Check this demo: 
Fill the field with any of the samples, then change some characters. It will often be able to tell you where your error is (within limits).

You are becoming increasingly selective.
First is "hashing attacks don't happen", then it's "hashing attacks don't happen to well-known cryptos", then it's "over this arbitrary market cap I chose such that just a few cryptos have ever achieved it for a significant amount of time". Look, this is not a serious discussion because you are cherry picking your sample at will. When Litecoin was attacked, it was the second largest crypto.

This format:
- allows for more than copy-paste to not be a complete pain (c+p wouldn't be a problem anyway)
- will make it much harder to forge addresses to make them look the same (using vanitygen style crackers)

I haven't spoken to Luke about his defensive patch, but do you happen to know whether or not he's taken that possibility into account with the new algorithm? Is it designed to be more asic-resistant?
Should ideally not be as ASIC-efficient so that some altruistic mining is at least possible. But in any case, the timing makes a big difference. In the next few years yield won't be as concentrated, we're past two halvings. Stability with fees must be reached, and it wouldn't be such a gold rush.
Keccak should be quite efficient in ASIC actually. That's what Luke proposed last time IIRC.


What I think it should be possible is a progressive switch of PoW. Stages towards a new PoW keeping a proportion of the old one while phasing it out. The reason would be not to force a spin-off too much.
Say 75% 50% 25% 0% of the old PoW in stages. Rather than a mix PoS/PoW like some alts do with alternative blocks. Obviously there are many possible implementations for this. Just a thought.
Mechanisms for switching PoW should be explored at some point anyway.

They're probably cashing out their profits in alt trading with the crises they are engineering, while their useful idiots scramble to patch their nodes.

The problem with BUttards is that they only want a dictatorship when they are on top. They defend simultaneously that Core has no structure and also it's dictated by Blockstream.

By "debunked" you mean you agree with the opposite arguments. That is not what "debunked" means.
He's absolutely right. Super-cheap transactions can fill up any remotely feasible blocksize, and in that respect the demand can be considered infinite.
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:19:09

Are you a gigablocker?
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:18:59
I can understand this view but there are several assumptions that don't quite hold to make it sustainable.
During the period of substantial block reward, there is a subsidy that makes many otherwise completely unsustainable usages possible. It was thought that this would be best used to encourage adoption by allowing people to try it with minor or zero fees. As soon as spammy services started popping out, this social contract was broken. There is an equilibrium to maintain, and it's also true than no nodes are forced to relay every transactions and no miner is forced to include them.
Nothing Luke did violated that. He simply altered defaults, and in the case of his version of the client he allows more configuration than vanilla Core.
People are freaking out now prematurely partly because of the existence of many non-transactional transactions competing for block space.
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:44:39
Even with 99% of the hash power I wouldn't bet a wet sock for BTU. PoWs are exchangeable (at a cost), but the people contributing to Core? not anywhere near.

Bcash is a more practical name for an alt-fork, since you don't want people to confuse a $600 coin for a $4300 one. Any non-confusing name would be fine by me.

If you want a long technical explanation, see:
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:24:27
Yeah, but that's not a $5 on-chain tx, which is what OP is talking about. For that, BTC is pretty poor unless you can leverage the pseudonimity as heavily as 100% of the price or even more.

Fees on behalf of the store amount to approx 8p per £100 purchase for debit (credit is charged differently, and thus not used as much for retail). Retailers happily pay that in exchange for the ease of accounting, in fact they generally prefer you don't pay cash. Which is why 99.9% of the times there are zero fees.

That's presuming a lot.
They came out and said basically the same. I'd guess they simply are not in regular contact with the rest of them. BitMex also. Note that Poloniex is more an alt market referenced to BTC than a classic BTC exchange, they cannot afford to have a different definition of what BTC is with respect to the major markets.

It's malware no matter what exact words are used on that page. What you can see in this page is the reasoning behind its delisting.
It's fine though because copay users have until late November to switch, which should be enough. But the earlier they are warned, the better.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:36:51
I'm aware, but I'm referring to your argument above on the PoW change.
PoW upgrade would be triggered only because of hashing, not because of other economical support. I have mixed feelings about that as I'm explained several times in the past.
PoW upgrade would be a measure against "miners setting the rules".
The fact of the matter is that 2X/jeffcoin would be hard-forking away, and not the other way around. They are the ones changing consensus rules on flag day set on ~21/Nov/17.
SegWit2X/jeffCoin will have to rebrand and add replay protection, because their legal stance is extremely dubious otherwise, being the ones doing the HF-ing. If they don't, they will be taken to court for sure with very bad prospects.

Depends on the exchange.
Bitstamp for instance, covered for withdrawal fees last I checked. They consolidate them in big transactions and they generally get into blocks early.
Maybe someone want's to test this now.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:33:31
The problem is this:
Other platforms based on the same blockchain principles will face the same scalability issues when they become anywhere near as popular. Bitcoin is working on fixing it via the  most effective and typical architecture solution: federated chains (layer 2) of different types with different trade-offs. Which by the way is ready (save for making it more palatable to the end user via interfaces etc) but it's relegated to TestNet because of the boycott imposed by BU.
"Big blocks" (in the order these people are championing) means a network so centralised it's no longer censorship resistant nor distributed enough to withstand attacks of many sorts (including government raids). This is the only advantage Bitcoin offers over a simple database, which would be much cheaper, faster and simple (and therefore more competitive).
I see you are reading your stuff and I commend you on that. Don't fall to the populistic slogans of these people. Look at the numbers.
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:08:26

Eventually. But most people want BCH to survive, even if precariously. So I doubt there are attempts too soon unlike they are easy to monetise heavily.
Ideally it would survive until the 2X co-opt attempt, so they are bitterly divided by then - always helps.

If only they had SegWit, eh.
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:14:29
I'm looking at the latest blocks, not averages.
It could be that some segwit miners are now for some reason mining outside of their previous pool. The reality is that the number of segwit blocks mined by "unknown" has jumped, and so has the share of this hashrate, coinciding with the spike.
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:08:57
I guess you mean ASIC.
GPUs are completely out of the question (for direct Bitcoin mining).
ASICs are currently not profitable with that budget, no matter your electricity costs.
*Maybe* you can mine some alt with GPUs and convert into Bitcoin. There have been good windows of opportunity for that.
Try this calculator and enter the specs of your rig of choice to see for yourself.

Not everybody will immediately implement these optimisations, so they will be ahead of the curve for a while. 
Over the long term, other considerations will come into play. There's also no infinite demand for Bitcoin raw txs above a certain fee which is much lower than the average one right now.

He actually literally said what the link said. The fact that Electrum may or may not support alts is irrelevant. And that doubt is actually quite justified IMO, I certainly would doubt it, and the same goes for Armory. Their authors have expressed quite explicitly they are against the HF and uninterested about BU, so there is nothing misleading about pointing this out. Sorry if it's inconvenient to your narrative. Trezor and others have expressed similar views, and they may even support other alts ahead of BU, if BU does split which isn't clear at this point.

That's why it's important to provide a way to unload a large share of this burden from the blockchain. These entities can price out many individuals over time from almost any fixed space you set for the block. All these intermediate transactions don't necessarily belong in the blockchain, neither logically nor practically.

@_date: 2017-08-02 11:32:48
Yeah, only in github alone there are over 10K forks. In reality, many many more.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:28:24
Yep, and the rate is quite astounding. Miners only seem to have realised of the trick by around Aug 19, and they were actually behind by quite a bit then. The last few days it's been around 5K per day excess coins. At some point the bagholders are going to run out of actual Bitcoin and fiat to sustain even this 1:7 price. I'd say it's holding quite well, considering. Not sure how long can this last, though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:12:35
The pattern is not trivial because newly minted coins cannot be sold right away so there may be other dynamics at play (accelerate the availability of previously minted coins). Certainly there is a pattern that differs quite a bit from naive profit maximisation, and it has changed over the last couple of days.
It's also clear that EDA allows for much faster minting than would be possible otherwise. But managing the sale of that BCH is not as simple as dumping it immediately in the markets. That would kill the scheme pretty quickly.

There's money and they pay A LOT for transfers. The infrastructure is shit, but that's doesn't have the effect a lot of people around here think it has, in payments concretely. It's more expensive, not cheaper. There's also often BANNED from doing many txs which they have to do illegally.

Nay, as bcash inflates and devalues, it takes less hashing to inflate it and devalue it further. Only one chain is going down if they don't fix this pretty soon.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:09:45
Why would he? Even if you don't use SegWit, you still benefit from the added space as your signature doesn't count towards the space taken in the block. You do this by embedding the tx in a P2SH.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:56:37
Nothing. Its market is too thin for a big pool to switch to it. BCH is not currently being used other than for speculation vs BTC and most miners will convert right away, bringing it down.
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:27:47
Every time? If both chains are compatible and there is no replay protection, the nodes will try to include all the txs they listen. That's expected behaviour. In fact, the word "attack" is dubious in this context. It's just a replay, whether it's an attack depends on the sender not wanting the tx to be re-transmitted somewhere else.
@_date: 2017-01-30 22:22:43
The meaning of "illegal" is the key here. Case in point, the only difference that made yesterday's block "illegal" was its block size. This definition of illegal is mostly deviation from Core, which is the reference at the moment.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:02:23
In transactions, around 3000. In size, probably no more than 1.2MB this week.

With a stronger say than the average guy on the development of Bitcoin Core? yes. With control of the mining? yes, the relatively few people who hold most of the hashing power. With control of the community? Not really, although most of us prefer the sanely moderated space than the loud-mouths elsewhere (which also get here if they say something of interest by chance).

Good question. No idea if these clients will automatically create new style transactions.
Johnson Lau enforced new-style txs to avoid replays on spoonnet with a version bit in the tx. There won't be such thing this week AFAIK. I've been disconnected for a bit so I'm not up to date with the latest UI improvements in Core and Electrum (I don't use Electrum). Usually introduces more cutting-edge features. Maybe there's something coming for the UI with regards to tx generation.
My bet is that Core will keep it simple, maybe change default behaviour soon.

The reality is that blocks are already too large for the protocol and the network as it stands and seriously compromises decentralisation. The cost of running a node and its inconvenience puts off 99% of the bitcoiners and there is no real way to achieve trustlessness otherwise as things stand.
Serious compromises have already been made towards blocks much larger than they should be, because of external pressures. Rather than have the system completely collapse as a decentralised network, devs do the right thing in erring on the side of caution. [Precautionary principle](

The problem is that this solution only scales marginally before you price out nearly all end-user nodes and you are left with a few institutional ones.
That's why it's important to put in place the mechanisms to establish payment channels that only persist to the main blockchain a tiny fraction of the total transaction information. That's the only way that Bitcoin can scale while remaining decentralised.
The bandwidth requirements for a well-connected 1MB node are already very high, and domestic bandwidth is never going to catch up with what would be needed for visa-like level of transactions, let alone cash-like level of traffic.

You can try a pool that automatically switches you to the most profitable coin at a given moment for a given PoW, like  for instance (there may be better, I'm a bit out of the loop).
Your hashing power for a given PoW depends heavily on the hardware you buy. You should probably make numbers with different hardware for the most common PoWs by volume. SHA256 I'd say it's out of the question unless you have over a million US$ to throw around, just to start.
Check your options and profitability for Scrypt, X11, EtHash, EquiHash, etc. You got to do your homework there.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:27:10

@_date: 2017-08-16 15:34:48
Yep, but the entropy for 12-word keys is just 125 bits then. Still, it should be enough, but I'd use 15 words (160 bit) instead because why not, lets have as much as the BTC pair themselves. At that point, trying to crack the BTC keypair itself is just as "easy".

Your bank is a centralised system, so the provisions to achieve that are pretty simple. You use a proprietary channel when you go to Starbucks.

Dyslexia? People make mistakes. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:53:13
Yes, that introduces complexity, because there are pools that do all their mining in-house (and they already have a big chunk of the hashing rate) and there are also other pools that agglutinate smaller miners. In theory they don't own their hashrate, but in practice they do control it.
This has to be studied pool by pool (a large majority of the hashing occurs in known pools, so that helps a bit).

128 bits can be a bit on the low side. 2048 rounds of PBKDF2 can be done very quickly with ASICs, I don't know if anyone is putting the effort into that though. But the thing is, PBKDF2 is very cheap to implement in hardware - I'd have used bcrypt.
Anyway, since addresses are 160 bits I don't see any strong reason to use any less than that. There is no space/bandwidth tradeoff to keeping these seeds, as opposed to BTC key-pairs.

Because Faster Payments are not (ano|pseudo)nymous, which is the actual use case. Also, the other person could be anywhere - although this wasn't the case right now, he just wanted some BTC to hodl.
You made a good point there by the way: Bitcoin cannot possibly compete with Faster Payments in many circumstances and it would be stupid to bloat the chain.


Fees per byte have to be higher. Fees per underlying transaction - not necessarily. Second layer is coming (and better usage of the first layer). Without an economic incentive it wouldn't. Thing is, it already is overly expensive to run a node and too many concessions have been made in that regard. The current effective 700KB blocks are perfectly okay.

I think the best you can do is supporting L2 tech, even if it's only via testing it.

That's perfectly plausible. It won't be perfect but with the amount of manpower they employ, they can literally start banning them one by one and leave most commercial VPNs out in a matter of days. Also, if they start jailing or fining people over VPN usage, most people will just stick to China websites.
They do it with forums, websites, etc. They have an updated block file with millions of entries they go through periodically, adding and removing items on the go.
As it is already, most people don't bother.
Maybe some companies will be given an exemption and expats will be able to browse the net from their workplace. I know someone in a big American company in China and they have access to gmail, wikipedia, BBC, etc. She can't use anything of that from home or from mobile.

Nice pointless metric.
Just looking at a few txs with dozens of outputs each - from services, exchanges, coinjoin, etc - they are typically 1KB+ and represent multiple exchanges of value.
Expect individual txs to be bigger, and fees of individual txs to be more expensive. Especially as the valuation of BTC goes up.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:13:38
That's what markets are generally indexed by. You could potentially mark it down in BTC. Although the very idea of market cap of a coin is often extremely flawed.

It's accurate.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:12:04
See 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:29:53
The difference is that a 20% loss of hashing in BTC leads to a 1000% increase in bcash. You are either disingenuous or incredibly stupid if you don't see the asymmetry in this problem. Also, BTC cannot be gamed via the "emergency downwards adjustment" like bcash can. Currently there are already 10K+ BCH extra in circulation compared to BTC. All of these very recent.
The problem is pretty mild in BTC in comparison. It amounts to 70% block size availability.
In bcash, it means inflation and effective outages.

@_date: 2017-08-16 14:33:09


Not entirely. By the way, they've added busy work already in the form of a long sequence of rounds. I'd have used a more tested password-oriented hash instead.


Mainly, yeah. Which is why I'd do 160 bits instead. There's no big tradeoff from using a key space as large as Bitcoin's itself. If you go above, then its cheaper to crack the keypair itself and it's completely pointless (assuming no vulnerabilities). I mean, it's just a three words more to match it.

That's ok, but not what I was talking about. The main problem with "coffees-in-the-chain" is that pruning doesn't solve this problem, and for it to solve it what I described above needs to happen - and it's a major trade-off.
So long story short, coffees-in-the-chain are NOT pruned, and only major privacy trade-offs allow pruning to reduce bloat.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:43:20
It would be nice, but very controversial. Goes without saying really.
This alt in particular is not a big deal, but the concentration in mining is pretty bad at this point. The demanding attitude from a concrete cartel makes a PoW change quite desirable really, but we'd need support from key exchanges.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:52:29


Address reuse can lead to fewer UTXOs, thus reducing the pruned size of the UTXO set and the size of the serialisation of the blockchain (which depends on other things too).




If you generate humongous amounts of UTXOs (by coffees on the chain or whatever else), there is no pruning that will save you from the bloat.
To remove the cost in blockchain space these balances will have to be consolidated somehow, either in old addresses (the example in my post above) or in new ones that reuse previous balances (privacy is sacrificed either way).
@_date: 2017-08-22 10:03:17
In the short term, because blocks are going to be effectively bigger since late Wednesday/Thursday or so (SegWit). Other scalability solutions on top of that will take a bit longer.

@_date: 2017-08-06 09:44:52
For profit, maybe. For expenses required for an attack, it's proportional to a side-by-side comparison. For the probability and the availability of single actors capable of bringing the network down, it's MORE than a side-by-side comparison, it's an all-or-nothing thing.

The probability of 9 (or 10, or 11) blocks in 31 minutes is ~0.46%
(the probability of having 12+ in the same period adds almost nothing)
Actually, it's simpler by calculating 1 - N[CDF[PoissonDistribution[3.1], 8]]    (result stands ~0.468%)
Accurate result for 9 or more blocks in 3.1 periods:
Seems like a pretty "good" run.
There is however some selection bias to picking specifically 31 minutes.
If we pick just from the fork block, it's 8 blocks in 33.7 minutes. 8+ blocks in 33.7 minutes has a probability of ~2.2%
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:26:40
Firstly because we're an unruly bunch and you would never have the backing of the community to a "Bitcoin CEO", and rightly so. Secondly, because if that was ever successful, it would provide a head that can be cut.

Currently hashing power has a strong recognition and is very centralised, particularly by pools with ownership of most of their hashing, mainly AntPool. The danger of this lingers no matter what, unless there is a PoW upgrade - which could be potentially very traumatic.

Faster Payments are a service included by banks and it's free. For debit, it's only (nearly) free for the vendor if they have a pretty good deal (which they get on high volume).

That's a ridiculous argument. Computer Go is advancing so it will soon be the case that your pocket Go software will destroy any humans. Doesn't make the game better or worse. It's certainly lesser studied than chess for AI.

For starters there are only ~16.5M BTC in existence at the moment. A fraction of them are really mobile and in the market. In the case of BCH, it's even much less because out of those who'd trade them, many can't at the moment. Possibly the vast majority.

Transaction prices don't depend on the amount at the present time, but on the size of the transaction.

It's well known that almost all of the fentanyl (an opioid) killing people in Canada and the USA in North America's "Opioid Epidemic" is coming from drug labs in China.  The NBC News video posted below on this page shows just how easy it is for drug dealers, but also Mexico's cartels, to buy illegal and deadly fentanyl from China's drug labs using Bitcoin.

I didn't bother doing the numbers, but the diff will stop readjusting leaving a rate of approx. 0.5 blocks/hour. How many blocks left this period? IIRC there will be approx 1000 blocks left in BCH's chain until the next period AFTER they have done all this downwards adjusting. That's ~83.3 days at 0.5 blocks/hour, from that moment. 3 months sounds about right, or am I missing something here?

You are claiming that the argument is "LOL, Bcash's EDA is going to kill it" - that's not true.
Whether you consider the theories convincing or not, they are well founded. After the second swing we're seeing how much it inflates BCH and how it goes essentially offine for hours. The pattern responds to most miners following profitability and it's consistent. If inflation hits the markets, which seems like a given, it will only drop lower and lower each oscillation.

We call that "pruned nodes" - the problem is not storing the entire blockchain. That is easy enough with blocks up to 10MB or so. The problem is the bandwidth required to gossip the entire tx set in real-time across the P2P network.

Check speeds instead: 
When it slows to a crawl, you have an effective outage for normal use. Completely unacceptable (if it was actually being used in the real world). And otherwise, you have uncontrolled inflation when compared to Bitcoin.
It's a lose-lose situation for bcash to have these oscillations, and eventually they will either HF a solution or watch the altcoin deflate in value.

I know better about chess to be fair. I've done some toy engines in Go which play good enough to beat beginners, and I understand how the new engines have progressed but I'm not truly up to date with the latest wave. I might get in there sometime but I'm busy lately with other things. I know enough to know that chess is away and beyond more mature in AI research than Go.
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:05:09


Convolutional NN are used on top of iterative exploration in AlphaGo. These approaches also exist in chess. In fact the parameters in Stockfish are refined via ML techniques IIRC. Definitely in some engines they use NN to help with the search, but in chess many strong known approaches are known that don't apply to Go. Unsurprisingly, because there have been decades of effort researching it and at the time it was a high priority goal in academy (Go has nowhere near the pull chess had in the 90s in the AI community, with people like Shannon making it a life goal and IBM throwing their weight at it).


Nothing complete, but more than enough to destroy people online you can be sure.
In any case it's just a matter of months to a few years until engines in mobile devices are unplayable for mere mortals unless they are handicapped or limited somehow. Just like happens with chess in the amateur level since the mid 90s.

Leaving aside the requirement of running a node, maintaining a repo oneself is not great user experience and it would be a requirement since Copay would be following an alt in a few months. Wallet software still needs to be kept up to date pretty actively.

The voting system is an incentive to make everything into bickering, politics and point scoring. But leaving that aside, the only real advantage here is traffic and the possibility of finding someone who can actually respond to you. If you divide subs, that is lost.

There have been NNs since the 1940s. They're ancient technology, they undergo periods of breakthrough like happened in the 80s and 90s and now again with commodity hardware being efficient for NNs.
There's nothing advanced about it, they simply are not so commoditised because they were not so useful for general computing. This might change. Hardware designed for high parallelism and NNs will execute them better than a chess engine.
They are not a silver bullet. Nothing is. They are incredibly fashionable now because they allow solving problems without fully understanding them, being a lot easier - not harder - to employ and program.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:37:45

Market cap is a flawed measure while most bcash holders still don't really know or care to move their coins. A tiny small percentage of the bcash in existence is setting the market price, making its value about as reliable as clams or Auroracoin back in the day (also airdropped into existence). Volume at this moment is merely speculative as bcash accepting businesses are few and far between. Some alts have plenty more real usage than bcash.
Sorry to break this news to you.

The problem being that BCH is essentially a penny stock, with volumes only comparable to BTC when in pump mode, and generally not even in the top five (~5% that of BTC).
It's unlikely that they will be able to keep it up, IMO. But I welcome their attempt, as there are still many people looking to get rid of their bcash they had not been able to access.

Chess is not intrinsically easy for computers. People have refined and discovered techniques over decades that work very well for computer chess and are effective against human play. That doesn't necessarily make it easier or harder for computers. Without the shadow of a doubt there was more effort into computer Chess than computer Go before strong engines occurred. Part of it is thanks to the strength of the hardware, part of it comes from the previous advances in AI that can now be used in Go.
I think talking about chess being easier or harder for computers is just a mistake, because it's not something you can compare in a way that will satisfy scientists in general. For instance, in terms of lines of code, most strong chess engines are massive and they carry a combination of many techniques. Some however are quite simple and still manage a decent level (computer-wise) - enough to destroy people. But most likely they wouldn't be possible without prior knowledge. So there really is no way to measure a statement like that.

The system is Open Source, it doesn't mean you can appropriate the brand while modifying consensus rules without overwhelming community consensus.
Of course it can be taken to court, and I guarantee you that someone will if they persist on not implementing replay protection while they initiate the HF.

The oscillation is huge in bcash, not so much in Bitcoin. Taking 24h averages, the worst oscillation thus far has been just around twice the regular oscillation/variance (~45% vs 20%). Bcash OTOH has seen its hashing multiply by 10x and back down to where it came from.

UTXOs disappear when you consolidate balances.
Pruning doesn't magically make UTXOs disappear from the blockchain, that was the point. I'm not arguing what pruning is, I'm just pointing out that pruning doesn't reduce the bloat from coffee-in-the-chain txs unless they are consolidated somehow.

Nope, the incentive is not to mine there. It won't adjust for a long time after reaching that 0.5 blocks/hour adjustment floor. This means miners there are losing money hand over fist right now and for quite some time, as difficulty is artificially kept high for almost 3 months.
As there is almost no market for BCH right now, it's uncertain what will happen if/when people can easily trade their BCH. Most miners won't gamble with that, esp. those with professional operations.

In the near future, non-priority channel opening transactions - those you can afford to wait a few hours to get through, let alone those you can afford to wait until weekends -  will be pretty cheap. Under $1 typically at current prices. 
You'd need the price to go up orders of magnitude and no other solutions to come into play in the interim (drivechains, etc) so you have a cost to open the channel in the thousands of US$. That'd be a champagne problem to have if you have any amount of BTC.

There are no facts in social sciences, and to some degree, pricing and economical expectations belong to that realm. There are more and less strongly verified theories by logic, evidence and experience.

Using an app connecting to a server you can. And in chess some apps do just that - like Lichess' analysis.
In chess, NNs are not working so well (for now). I've done engines myself and I'm following the developments and as of today, almost no improvement comes from that approach in quality of play. It's a different problem - not simpler or harder, just different, and different things work.
@_date: 2016-12-07 18:30:19
We've spent years debating that, actually. Maybe you missed it.
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:12:00
The block itself is "signed", meaning that the existence of the transaction in the chain is verified. 
To verify individual transactions, you need the signatures for them, which you need relayed to you. This happens in two ways:
- using non-SegWit outputs, you have them in the block just like before (p2pkh, p2sh, and p2pk output types - and you can still interact with SegWit addresses through embedding, but let's ignore that)
- using SegWit outputs - in such case you need to "receive the bigger box" to put it in the terms from the video (even if it's just the box which concerns you) or otherwise you are delegating the verification.
The problem with this video is that it's dumbed down of details so much that you cannot possibly know what is actually going on. It leaves out things like script verification computing time, even the size of the block used in BCH. It also leaves out things like how do old nodes still. It assumes all participant in transactions are nodes, which really isn't the case for years (I wish it was) etc. It doesn't even mention how the new blocks account for size, or how much of the block do signatures generally take.
I don't think the video can cover everything, for starters because the system prior to SegWit already isn't nowhere near as simple as depicted. But I wish they at least mentioned latency, SPV, and cost of signature verification in CPU-time, the existence of attacks based on hashing and propagation. Then one could understand the many things that can go wrong by simply multiplying the block maximum size by 8 leaving everything else untouched (or almost untouched).

Except not really.
Chess is about as helpless as Go without human-doctored heuristics - always comparing vs strong humans, which itself is not a Universal measure but just an estimate. These have been devised over decades for chess, and in the case of Go it's some sort of self-training that's doing the trick.


If you said "for existing engines" then I'd agree. But "computer" here is a completely abstract idea and I cannot just take that assertion as valid.
In any case, using "computer assistance" to destroy humans is already just as possible on either. The argument goes out of the window. A few years ago, it would have been different because super-strong Go engines weren't available.

No, that's ridiculous. In Chess there needed to be decades of research on pruning before computers produced any sort of decent play. Even powerful computers today cannot bruteforce more than a few plys which is insufficient to beat a strong amateur.


In Go the pruning approach is not feasible, but iterative exploration is perfectly feasible and already produces master play. There are also chess engines using this approach, since earlier than Go.


They're the same now that AlphaGo derivatives are open source. The majority of programming humans are incapable to mastermind a Chess or a Go software that beats masters from a blank slate, but they can take working source code and make it run, and make derivatives.
I strongly disagree than chess is less interesting for being better researched earlier. Much to the contrary, chess is super deep and having strong engines helps understand it better. Neither can be fully understood.

Yes, but it doesn't seem to be the case here. It's being used internally. Unless this happens to be an alt being used in the wild, but I doubt it.

It's a recurring theme. They have a corporation-like mindset where short-term (or long-term) economic gain prevails above everything else, when a large number of people in this community and even more so within the early adopters have radically different utility curves to this.
In another message Gavin Andresen cannot fathom a second chain surviving if the few biggest exchanges don't immediately carry it. These people have a massive blind spot for the whole point of Bitcoin despite all the time they've been around.

Ok, pretty sweet that you had that info at hand.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:58:50
There we could have encroachment the other way.
Something between the median and the weighted average that isn't too complex and behaves decently.
For instance:
- Disallow votes outside of the limits
- quantize increments so that miners don't game the voting system too easily. For instance, only allow whole MiB or half MiB quantities
- pick a good median approximation calculated with an algorithm on integer numbers that cannot produce rounding errors (not hard to calculate with the amount of data we'd have)
- include some sanity limits like limiting the amount of votes considered, to avoid degenerate cases with difficulty adjustment. Pick the fist MAX_N_VOTES. If less than MIN_N_VOTES are valid then the previous value remains
Evaluate for the worst case scenarios using simulation and some napkin numbers. This can be arbitrarily complicated by using data like the actual size of the blocks in the period etc, but generally a terrible idea doing so.
Should be more than enough and better than just exponentially raising the bar just because.
@_date: 2015-08-27 07:41:33
Bittorrent is very different for many reasons, some of them already mentioned in another post.
In Bittorrent if a block doesn't propagate in a few dozens of seconds or even minutes, it's not a big deal. The requirements for synchronism are much lower.
@_date: 2015-08-24 07:05:07


Heh... you're trolling me there aren't you...


It's not like fees are anywhere near being so bad we should be desperate to multiply the size of the max block. Honestly, it's ridiculous how this problem is fabricated to push an agenda.


Yep exactly, absolutely false dichotomy man. We're killing this thing as a community. Shame people are such a weak link to the whole idea.
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:38:57
Not anywhere. You'd be suddenly changing the game for a number of players. I don't think it's sensible to do without verifiable data.
@_date: 2015-08-19 11:41:06
Yep agreed (except that there's no fundamental need that "brand consensus" on "Bitcoin" will be achieved any time soon if at all). 
Still this is a very unpopular reality - not opinion - that will get you downvoted both here and in *redacted*.
The dev+community split is making a Bitcoin split a very real possibility.
@_date: 2015-08-25 12:01:20
We start getting into a grey area.
Some think such big blocks are a dangerous test on the main chain, so they can softfork to protect Bitcoin in their mind.
You have to do serious mental gymnastics to call that an attack.
In any case this can happen and will happen if a majority of mining power feels threatened.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:21:21
It would be a major departure from best practices if big corporations start taking the technical decisions that steer Bitcoin towards one usage or another.
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:46:21
You don't need the average to increase to test big blocks, just max size does it. For the whole thing to collapse you don't need the average operation to fail, failing eventually is enough.

Satoshi introduced it in 2010 (circa October IIRC) as a "temporary anti-DOS measure" until a free market generated.
@_date: 2015-08-24 07:19:59
Nope it's not about feeling, it's about the concept. The Bitcoin as a raw micropayments platform through increasing the blocks exponentially is completely incompatible with the decentralised, pseudonymous, user-controlled Bitcoin I've advocated strongly since 2010. The motives are not feelz but very reelz, and the realisation that a big part the community fails to either see it or care about it means we need to go to the end with this through either forcing a split or the end of XT. Preferably the latter.
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:52:34
If you can memorise a full private key you don't need a brainwallet. You just generate an address with a strong generator and good entropy and then memorise the full key pair (or just the private key).
The suggestion here is a compromise you don't need such a memorisation effort.

Why would anyone NOT be against bigger blocks? Bigger blocks are an expense, they come at a higher cost for the infrastructure, especially for nodes.
Whether this higher cost is an advisable/necessary trade-off up to a point is a different story. But wishing for it? No, I don't.

Currently, stake is the only measurable thing in the protocol other than post-fork mining power. So not as crazy as many would think.

75% of the block versions set to BIP 101 over 1000 consecutive blocks.
There's absolutely zero proof that they'd have the actual mining power behind. Actually the 3 blocks that set the flag I believe they were mined by Slush with Core (I'd be very surprised if they deployed untested XT alongside Core just to give the voting option right now).
People are assuming Core won't do anything about these games played by XT. This is running a vote eternally until one's option wins, which is essentially dishonest even if it was technically sound (which it isn't). On top of it, without supposedly risking anything and having the other side carry all the risk (and the community, and the credibility of the whole project). Well, that's sorted by having them risk losing a tonne in mining revenue for fucking with Bitcoin. Then the vote becomes much fairer. There are several approaches so Core can stand their ground, a few already mentioned several times in the sub.

"Evolve" kind of assumes some versions of it dying and others surviving. Maybe you mean it will "adapt"?
Possibly, but technically it could "evolve", into there being more than one blockchain... impossible to be sure if a sizeable of the nodes disagree to the rules.

Based on altcoin experience, this happens mostly because of lack of interest and expectations on the coin.

I have some that I didn't manage to sell before it plummeted to 0.07 BTC or so. I sold a bunch at around ~0.35 BTC which I doubt I will see again.
Rather than bcash I'd have fiat. The entire concept of bcash has zero interest to me, and for speculative value there are more interesting schemes right now. At 0.2 BTC it will be worthwhile to me to take the time to split the remaining ones and sell them. I'm hoping it pumps to that level, we'll see.

The cap safeguards extreme situations where miners can vote for block sizes that cannot be sustained by the system (either too big or too small). It's based on current data statistics, which is basically the best we have.

Nah, without mining you don't really have a say in the vote. But thanks for keeping a node anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-31 01:43:22
There have been proposals based on past block sizes similar to this one. Maybe not x4 but the idea is similar. 
The problem with x4 is that it would permanently depress fees, and mining needs to find a sustainable income before block rewards stop being sufficient. Or else it will collapse.

@_date: 2015-08-16 14:55:23
Indeed, it's also contradictory.
These miners are voting for bigger blocks now, BIP101 means bigger blocks in 2016, and a completely fixed increase model for 20 years up to 8 Gigabyte blocks.

That still wouldn't stop a PoW from providing "useful results" as a side-effect of the calculations.
The problem with all these stated is that results don't efficiently prove themselves and are also bandwidth-inefficient. They also have no way to modulate difficulty that is effective and solid, and they have intermediate results. This almost guarantees a certain order of operation for every problem which would make the slightly faster processor win virtually every time.
What the ASIC FAQ does explain is why the players who play unfairly will take over the network, making the whole thing completely useless. And also failing to secure the network.

There could be speculative bubbles powered by the mining oscillation. After all the weaker side is easier to attack and this creates a vicious circle of perceived strength causing one or the other chain to fall off and stall.
What if the Chinese are suspicious of the predominantly American culture in XT? with even some perceived hostility?
I think whoever claims to be able to guarantee the outcome of this is fooling himself.
They should probably consider changing the difficulty retargeting algorithm, it adjusts rather badly and this can be a massive problem in this scenario for whoever uses it.

Oh, good for them if that's actually true.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:02:02
The code is trivial, what's hard is getting the network to agree to a change unless they're very convinced of it with overwhelming consensus. This isn't the case now.
My reply was meant to show that it's not a matter of code. Making the block size limit bigger is absolutely trivial. The problem here is that some want to push a long term agenda right now taking advantage of the panic.
@_date: 2015-08-31 08:46:59
Yep, Bitcoin will either be permanently micro-governed by a master group of developers, or by systems like BIP 100 in the sense that it adjusts without requiring code modification and cannot be gamed from external factors other than pressuring the miners.

Apparently there were UDP flood attacks on XT nodes yesterday. Other than that it seems like XT support is already stable: around 0.6% of the mining power and ~15% of the full nodes (unverifiable but looks like it).
@_date: 2015-08-22 23:03:24


It's not unreasonable but we have no idea.
What's true is that pseudonode included the XT spoofing option 1 week ago. I assume at least someone is doing just that.
The reality is that node statistics really don't mean much. Proof of work on the other hand is solid.

I think that's a bit unfair on Satoshi considering this is the first software that does anything remotely similar to itself.
With limited time and manpower it would be a lot to ask to predict these architectural problems or to correct them.
Even years later we are still discovering caveats we couldn't even imagine.
And usually I'm not generous at all when judging code, I'm a bit of a cunt. But there's a context there to respect.
@_date: 2015-08-20 12:48:47
As a relay it means fuck-all at the moment. You could be running pseudonode for all the difference it makes. As a relay you don't choose to make big blocks and you don't have mining power to support a big block or small block branch.
So, in relation to the question made by OP the answer is no.

BIP 101 is a 20 year fixed plan that would need a soft fork to stop or rectify.

@_date: 2015-08-18 11:35:09
Some posts here (not OP) seem to have a naive perception of the way incentives can work out.
Selfish interest needs positive knowledge to work properly. If enough people are misguided enough to make a wrong decision believing it's in their own self interest, they can bring down any system.
If you pan out enough, every system comes about from self interest, even Russian Revolution communism. It's when you pan in that you see they articulate differently that self interest, and the market knowledge also varies significantly, and specially knowledge symmetry.
Expecting things to work because "it would be bad for everybody if they didn't" is delusional and misguided. History has proven time and again that this isn't the case and that people do indeed collectively shoot themselves in the foot pretty fucking often.
@_date: 2015-08-28 17:42:45
As long as we do it with verifiable data I'm okay with that. I will be running stats to monitor latency and orphan rates. There won't be increases higher than 2x in one go.

Currently it's 1MB.There are other considerations like the softlimit and the fact that miners can always put as few transactions as they want. Something I'd elaborate on but I prefer just to lay the data here without pushing my judgment.
BIP 101 would immediately raise it to 8MB when the algorithm triggers and double it every 2 years for 20 years, leaving it at 8 Gigabytes because "it cannot grow forever". To stop this process a soft fork would be necessary.
Detail : 
Alternatives are BIP 100 which adjusts the block size dynamically through miner vote, or just a 1 time block increase to allow more time for other scalability development to happen.
@_date: 2015-08-28 08:23:30

There's also a risk that you keep your coins but the complete meltdown that a contentious fork may cause has devalued them in the market to pennies on the pound. So you get to keep them but now they're nearly worthless in such an scenario.

You don't need to identify yourself to purchase Bitcoins. In the example you give, you are exchanging US$ for JP¥ over the counter (OTC). You can do the same with Bitcoin.
Your jurisdiction may or may not allow this. For instance, in some Latin American countries, dealing with foreign currency is illegal (and still commonplace).

That depends on the nature of the sequence.
A sequence of 12 words that happen in a book or in lyrics or something like that, is very likely to be tried.
You need to measure at least approximately the size of the space of your system. Make sure it's big enough, and if possible run it through a slow and secure hash function like a tight bcrypt or scrypt.

Too late for integrating BIP 101 into Core, that option is gone.
We could end up different nodes and miners behaving erratically and possibly introducing privacy problems. XT and Core+BIP101 simultaneously could lead to completely unpredictable bugs. The blocks cannot be told apart from the version string any more if that happened.
@_date: 2015-08-23 23:09:35
I'm a bit tired of explaining this subject in so many places. I certainly believe the XT strategy is extremely dishonest and drastic measures are perfectly justified. Morality is out of the window as far as I'm concerned. I'd explain more about the strategies I have in mind but maybe I will collect some stuff later on. This will go on for a while. Certainly I will take action as much as I can.

That depends. If they are supporting BIP 100 (which seems likely as they chose the same amount as in the paper) then that would mean dynamic blocksize doublings or halvings.
BIP 101 on the other hand commits to a long term doubling spiral that will need a soft fork to stop or reverse.
@_date: 2015-08-31 11:41:36
I know KNCMiner switched from BIP101 to "either BIP 100 or BIP 101" but I didn't know Circle, BitPay, etc all switched to BIP 100.
In any case I think it's dangerous when interests start lobbying like this on something that is ultimately technical. These decisions do impact companies by reinforcing one model or the other but we need to be responsible and stop looking at our individual interests.

We don't have verifiable data on how long would they take to propagate to other big mining operations.
The reasonable thing to do would be to test this progressively. It's extremely irresponsible to test a huge jump in max blocksize live on the main chain and be exposed to spam attacks for a while until we find out if it's ok or not.

IMO if we were to try a hardfork any time soon it would be wise to do it with as little as 1.25MB or 1.5MB first not for capacity reasons, but to ensure that miners simply lifting the limit completely or doing something else are indeed forked off soon and we can test it quickly. Maybe use the opportunity to introduce minor softfork changes too, as a previous step to a more permanent solution.
Note that introducing something intended as very permanent and drastic right now will make it very hard to introduce any changes at all in the future, and we're still relatively in early days regarding development with fundamental things still in the works.

You need to take into account the traffic in Bitcoin.
I'm not ruling out that it can be done properly adjusting stuff, with careful limits and testing, etc. But given the already taxing strain of running a Bitcoin full node it's important to be careful with that, as the reaction to expect is most of the load moving to a few privileged areas and this is not necessarily good in all measures.
On top of that, Bitcoin is already a system of critical importance with a lot of load.

@_date: 2015-08-18 10:52:38
 seems consistent with the actual code.
The relevant bit for deployment is:
"Deployment shall be controlled by hash-power supermajority vote (similar to the technique used in BIP34), but the earliest possible activation time is 2016-01-11 00:00:00 UTC.
Activation is achieved when 750 of 1,000 consecutive blocks in the best chain have a version number with bits 1,2,3 and 14 set (0x20000007 in hex). The activation time will be the timestamp of the 750'th block plus a two week (1,209,600 second) grace period to give any remaining miners or services time to upgrade to support larger blocks. If a supermajority is achieved more than two weeks before 2016-01-11 00:00:00 UTC, the activation time will be 2016-01-11 00:00:00 UTC.
Block version numbers are used only for activation; once activation is achieved, the maximum block size shall be as described in the specification section, regardless of the version number of the block."
Note that this requires Core and other nodes to play along and not spoof the version string. This mechanism cannot be guaranteed to be safe without collaboration either passive or active from Core. XT can actually trigger, then lose the mining war, and have a lot of people lose BTC. Not to mention the havoc this would cause in the market. Even just the anticipation of this possibility.

This attack is perfectly plausible no matter how many altforkers wish it away, and it's dead simple. 
Everybody think about the repercussions of this. There is no such thing as XT safely taking over without collaboration from Core - either active collaboration or passive collaboration. XT proponents - worse, their useful idiots - can lose a ton of money for their recklessness. And with them everybody because the whole ecosystem will suffer from this fiasco.
The XT plan is also dishonest. People talk about "don't fear the hard-fork" because they believe they are in the safe side of it. When they find out they're not they don't like it so much, do they.

There are several things I'd like to go on about in this long convo but to avoid getting into a massive wall of text that nobody will read, I will just write down a couple of bits from the conversation.
34:56 
interviewer: [...] I don't know if the interests of Coinbase or today's miners, or today's start-ups are necessarily those of those future stakeholders.
G.A.: I think that might me right, I mean I'm... **I tend to be pretty pragmatic so I tend not to try to plan, you know, ten years ahead (hah), I would much rather plan ten weeks ahead (eh haha)**. Just because eheuhm if you, if you try to plan too far ahead you never get anything done. You just, you'll ignore... if you ignore short-term problems because you are trying to solve some long-term problem, you'll never get to the long-term. Right? You won't get past those short-term problems to actually get to the long-term. So... I mean yeah I kinda... It's kind of fun to think about future stakeholders, but it's hard for me to imagine that I know who those future stakeholders are going to be. I just don't know how Bitcoin is going to evolve. I don't know if it's going to be... if it's going to take over Africa instead of having all these little currencies that they hyperinflate every once in a while[...] 
G.A.: [...]it starts at 8MB on January 11th, and then it doubles every two years and so January 11th 2018, assuming that this change rolls out and miners are on-board, the maximum block size will be 16MB, and 32MB two years later, and 64, and so on, aaaall the way up to a really scary-sounding number of 8GB which freaks people out because I think people aren't good at imagining what will technology look like in 20 years, and **I'm very confident that in 20 years 8GB blocks will not be a big deal. Just because I've seen the last 20 years of technological progress and it's amazing.**
So maybe he thinks development and the environment of Bitcoin in the next 20 years are not inter-related? or that he can predict one without having the slightest idea of the other?
I found that... strange.
@_date: 2015-08-25 00:54:38
Yes, and this is why I'd much rather stay in a coin supported by people like you and the many others that have what I think are their priorities right, at whatever price it ends.
A sort of Ripple artificially run in a blockchain and completely co-opted by American agencies and a few corporations that don't even hide they are in cahoots to make it a mere traceable payment processor... absolutely doesn't interest me at any price. Isn't Ripple exactly the sort of architecture that will work best for that? it's only missing the buy and hold speculation incentive. As soon as nodes increasingly add trust-based features, home-calling and non-neutral considerations... then why not Ripple? well, there's the brand stealing too.
In fact I'm now looking forward to get rid of these people, which is why I agree fully with your post and I'm starting to feel better about the prospects of a subset of this community.
So it could be the best for both philosophies to resolve this.
Shame about the people who are holding more than they can afford to lose right now because this is going to tank even more. I already called it as soon as it became clear Mike Hearn would try a schism fork.

@_date: 2015-08-11 10:57:32
I think the Feathercoin argument is pretty good.
More than the supermajority code which is completely implementation-dependent, the major difference here is that Feathercoin comes with a completely different "brand" and its community didn't actively seek to absorb the Litecoin ecosystem into its own.
If you take "BitcoinXT" exactly but call it something else without "Bitcoin" in it, what would you call that? and what would you expect the community to consider it?
It's clear that in Bitcoin, technical and political arguments often intertwine, because majorities are important. Mining majority, economic majority, ecosystem support majority are all crucial.
PS: I don't think the big block vs small block discussion is off-topic, but maybe these threads should have a flair because they can get tiresome after one has been discussing the same exact arguments for months on a daily basis.
@_date: 2015-08-16 01:10:07
The thing is, if the miners don't it's completely ineffective.
What you can do, if you mine at all, is ask your pool to include a vote for 8MB blocks in the coinbase scriptSig like some ~40% of the miners are doing. Or some size bigger than 1MB. That's if you think the 1MB limit is a short term problem, something we actually don't know for sure.
@_date: 2015-08-06 23:54:58
I'm not sure what you're calling a soft fork.
The fix was backwards incompatible. Indeed the situation is very similar in that the older DB rejected bigger blocks than a certain threshold. I remember those two better because I reviewed the code throughout myself.
If a majority had insisted to reject bigger blocks or simply to change the DB system, the fork would be exactly like a fork between small blockists and big blockists.
The politics were much simpler then because the block limit was low and the DB upgrade was extremely easy to sell as an improvement.
But the blockchain forks just the same. Politics aside.
@_date: 2015-08-06 22:40:19
We are already running an altcoin of the original Bitcoin. Several backwards-incompatible changes have been introduced. The namesake and the legitimacy of Bitcoin as being itself comes from the overwhelming consensus.
The blockchain doesn't really distinguish between bugfixes and design decisions as long as they are both backwards (and sideways) incompatible. These changes have already happened. What's new is that there is considerable division in the community.
So yes, this is politics, but politics have already happened before. Multisig for instance. DB change for instance.
Andreas is essentially right. If you go against consensus you'll be wiped. If, for instance, exchanges agree to the other blockchain and not the one you're on, that alone is enough to wipe you out and nobody will "play" in your blockchain. You need an ecosystem to go with your blockchain, otherwise there's no fork for you.

Not in an scenario of uncertainty. Things may go volatile and end up in a myriad of possible scenarios.

At such price competitors would also sell.
As I say, they cannot stretch their prices so much despite having some advantage in the market. This market is not competitive, but I don't think it's as mad as that right now. Otherwise they would just raise their prices much more.
Also the ROI formula is just a rough guesstimate. I wouldn't expect these miners to ever achieve ROI in terms of BTC, esp. with these valuations (running costs are higher now in BTC terms than they would be with more expensive BTC).

There's a thin (or not so thin) line between a state that provides Rule of Law, army to defend the borders, and little more, and "central planning" when we're talking about the police.
Libertarians usually want a very strong police (or they may be ancaps or anarchists unknowingly). I don't know if that's good or bad, but it's a point of view.
I personally draw the line in that nobody other than the involved parties should have control of transactions or communication. That means that, yeah, people will browse kiddy porn, snuff, terror propaganda, etc. And people will send money to ISIS, try buying illegal drugs (whatever the problem with that is), purchase guns, launder crime money, or whatever. They will have to do their policing of the crime per se and not on behalf of destroying freedom of speech, private communications and private transactions (which are freedoms that most if not all governments DO NOT recognise and they will resist violently to any attempts to establish them).
@_date: 2015-08-28 14:32:29


Are you sure about that?
@_date: 2015-08-27 07:26:45
Generally speaking there is a cost, because these stats are valid elsewhere. 150GB+ is very significant in many many places, and it will have a real cost (even if it's hitting QoS, or needing to pay extra, or needing a different subscription, or just having generally shittier internet at home for no substantial individual benefit).
If we want people to run nodes from domestic connections at all, and I think we shouldn't give up on that lightly, we just cannot multiply bandwidth consumption by 4 or 8. Much rather allow time for internet connections to improve as incredibly as the very proponents of huge blocks (4MB+ currently) are predicting.
That's not even going into the many other considerations of doing that in a drastic manner.
@_date: 2015-08-22 21:55:33
The community has no say in mining matters. Miners have certain powers that make stretching them out very dangerous.
For instance, the few most powerful pools could de-facto softfork to smaller blocks if they so decided just orphaning blocks under their own rules. They don't need Core devs or anyone's permission to just do the softfork themselves.
That's a "nuclear" option that I'm pretty sure they don't want to use but if the gap between the block sizes they can effectively distribute and the decision of the devs is big enough it will just happen. And there is nothing at all we can do about it without introducing fundamental changes to the system.

I think that's a bit dramatic. If anything, it's meant to be de-legitimising of the resulting blockchain. I don't see "altcoin" as a pejorative terms and there is nothing inherently belittling about this concept. Maybe you see altcoins negatively?
What I'd agree on is that the term is misguiding. At least Mircea's "Gavincoin" is slightly amusing. But "altcoin" is pretty much neutral to me, it just associates the reality of that possible fork with very different existing things.

I'm sure they have been doing well so far but BTC price is a big factor in this. Price point, difficulty, efficiency, costs to recover, BTC value, halving closing in, etc many factors. Others have come and gone. If BTC dips under $200 short term I'd expect it will start to get tight for them margins wise. We'll see how it goes for them but I wouldn't assume they can just double the price if BTC goes to half the price and not take a massive hit in the market.

@_date: 2015-08-18 07:36:03
You can't, because you are not guaranteed that your transactions will be included in both sides. When the fork triggers in this scenario, for sure there will be transactions in the XT side not present in the Core side. This makes balances unreliable and the whole system would collapse. There could be some stabilization if both systems forked to ignore each other with a protocol version, but by then the damage would have been phenomenal already.
This is a similar scenario to that described by Mike Hearn here:  (oh by the way, he's ready to push an update in XT to checkpoint a fork in minority, which can trigger this without needing to have 75% flagged blocks bogus or not).

Current BTC valuation depresses the hardware miner market, as expected. With $400+ coins these would be very quick to recoup the expense anywhere, let alone $600+ coins.
At $228 like now they are very unlikely to be profitable or in any case be more profitable than simply buying the equivalent BTC. But some people will run them at a loss.
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:21:36
The problem of that plan is the transition, the balances, etc. Maybe you'd have to suspend trades because a dirty fork would mean randomly inconsistent balances, being able to transmit doubly from before the fork to each chain, and so on.

The main idea is that it will be driven by miner vote and it will allow for quick adjustments in the range [/2,*2].

The cap appears to be a safeguard. Nothing so extraordinary IMO. Miners can vote for there not to realistically be other nodes than themselves, which is not immediately tangible to the incentives but still dangerous to the network. Miners may also not be affected by congestion in other parts of the network, they can even be short-term benefited by it eventually.
Same with the bottom cap.
@_date: 2015-08-19 09:55:30
That is yet another "game".
Both the agent string and the block version of that are indistinguishable from XT so it would be assumed to be support for the full XT. Again, being the "useful idiots" of Mike Hearn.
If you want just bigger blocks, do what many have been doing for a long time, express that vote in Coinbase scriptSig, as suggested by jgarzik in BIP 100 but not meaning necessarily support for BIP 100.

Yeah, but generally they don't do that. The network would work much worse if they applied drastic throttling.


Exactly. Which is why we don't promote that. Also, there's degrees of "badly" that equate in practice to "not working".

Because then your blocks would be rejected. Currently 100% of the big pools run the Core rules. Your attempt at forking would be obliterated.

A 51% attack typically refers to attempts to double-spend.
But miners can in any case softfork, without individually doing anything questionable at all. Individual miners are explicitly allowed to have softer blocksize limits of their own, and to choose the transactions they want to include.
This introduces a 25% scheme, not sure you can call it an attack when it's a perfectly recognised mechanism of the original blockchain system.
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:35:24
You are looking at the wrong variables IMO.
Power is not an issue for biggish operations, as you said they can run hashing and validation/inclusion in different places.
The issue here is that all pools ran in a few jurisdictions that will likely collaborate and collude in imposing policy to miners.
We want pools in places hostile to each other. We want pools in China, in the US, in Russia, in Japan. In as many places as possible, otherwise international governance can just corral the whole thing and this is just Paypal artificially run in a blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:31:30
Of course, as individual players.
The moment you have them all collude we have a serious problem in the whole Bitcoin system. Imagine if 8 of the biggest US corporations dictated policy to the government or the Federal Reserve.

This already happens with altcoins, and there are even services like multipool.us that automatically pick the most profitable coin for the algorithm you mine. (I suspect you know this already since you are quite knowledgeable in pool mining, but just in case).

For a range as big as 1MiB - 32MiB I think increments of 512KiB would be better. It limits the gaming of the vote. In fact the unit should be something like N * 512KiB. Votes would be /BV2/ for 1MiB up to /BV64/ with every integer in between being a valid vote. I'm assuming here hard limits of 1MiB and 32MiB.
3 months are some 13148 blocks. Easy to calculate de median or any percentiles of a set of this size with basically any processor. I'd go for the median because second-guessing the miners would make them inflate the vote to correct that. You want the miners to vote for what they want so the system is relatively honest and there is less asymmetry.
A bit more here if you want to give it some thought: 
PS: quantisation makes these vote behave a bit like ranges.

Worst comes to worst they will change the PoW to something else.
The amount of people interested in the original Bitcoin vision as opposed to a cheap payments processor is more than big enough that it's guaranteed it will have traction.

There are a bunch of subs specifically pointing at these topics, like BitcoinXT and bitcoin_uncensored. Also a faction within a sub can still organise and brigade a certain topic.
It's undeniable that this topic merits special treatment within this sub as far as I can see. There is just no way that this lot would stop pushing their agenda and just discuss Bitcoin in general. Maybe when things resolve one way or the other, even if this resolution is a permanent split leaving BTC valued at pennies on the pound.
@_date: 2015-08-30 22:24:07
From Europe I think the bigger divide is US vs rest of the world, in many respects regarding Bitcoin. Even from the UK it looks like that.
My personal impression is that if there's a split on block sizes and priority for domestic node, a lot of Europe would join Asia. Russia and Eastern Europe seems split but I doubt they'd go the US way.
I can't see any realistic scenarios that it wouldn't be a clusterfuck but that doesn't mean it cannot happen.

BitcoinXT does indeed change the protocol, as it changes consensus rules.
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:22:23
XT with all that code previously rejected in Core has already appropriated its own brand and also BIP 101.
If you run a node with an XT agent string you advertise XT. There's no way to pick and choose what parts of XT you support. It's effectively like a vote, and if you vote for a given politician "just because of policy X" and that politician gets into power, you get the whole pack.
If you mine a block with the BIP 101 version flags right now, it will be interpreted as an XT supporting mine. If BIP 101 triggers in an environment like the current one (it cannot trigger right now) then you'd expect XT behaviour from the miners and the nodes, with all of the agenda.
XT cannot be redone now, effectively. Even BIP 101 is lost to it.
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:55:32
The problem here is that the elements of control are proliferating. The disconnect between holder, transmitter, merchant, node and miner is ever bigger, and each of these factions is starting to collude to impose their rule.
This doesn't end well.
The idea that lesser coordination between all parties leads to a freer market is naive, or disingenuous.
@_date: 2015-08-27 10:05:59
Is that just node traffic?
@_date: 2015-08-30 20:53:48
I read that when it came out. I think the BoE is a bit out of the loop with recent developments. Bitcoin has the potential to be very hard as a currency, but not if it starts proliferating in forked blockchains that each emit new currency and confuse the saver with uncertain exchange rates.
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:44:36
20 years from now? I expect that they do minor transactions using off-chain solutions (side chains, smart contracts, open bazaar or whatever is there at the time).
If in 20 years time - much earlier really - there's no other effective way to do transactions other than via banks-exchanges or directly in the blockchain, then bitcoin will be useless for microtransactions.
The logic of including a gazillion transactions with near-zero fee is a complicated subject. Indeed many miners don't do it, because it's highly unprofitable for them. Already even at 1MB there's a gap between what some miners actually fill and the hard limit, a gap that would go absolutely bananas even at just 8MB right now.
It's even arguable that increasing the block limit could create a worse behaved blockchain right now that we haven't really reached 1MB per real block. If miners expect others to include bigger transaction sets they might start including less themselves when it's antieconomic for them to do so. Then we'd have an even more jagged graph and slower transactions that miss more blocks.
So it's delicate. What I'm pretty sure about is that I don't like the idea of laying down a plan for 20 years that will need a fork to rectify and that will end in something so radically different. Anything else looks more sensible to me, including BIP100, including a one-off hardfork, including leaving 1MB and see how it behaves for some more time. The plan I like the least of those I've seen is BitcoinXT. Worries me that a lot of people support it without understanding it (although so far no pools do).
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:02:54
Note that I just used OPs terminology. Do you "support bigger blocks"? then... just sign here in the dotted line, no need to read the fine print...
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:13:37
Only one block was mined with the BIP 101 indicator set.
BIP 101 specifies that the algorithm will activate two weeks from the moment when 750 blocks are mined with that indicator within 1000 consecutive blocks.
In the last 1000 blocks - or ever for that matter - only 1 block has this version.
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:55:53
They are not. But holder interests don't mine blocks of any size nor distribute them in the network.
Pushing them to do stuff they may have problems doing is just an invitation for them to collude. Rather than that we want them to agree publicly.
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:53:07
Thank fuck.
Go Asia!
@_date: 2015-08-13 21:39:31
I can probably get behind BIP 100 or a similar solution with different constants, and translate this debate to miners. But establishing now a 20 year roadmap that will need a soft-fork to reverse sounds like a terrible idea to me (BIP 101, BitcoinXT).
Soft forks can be serious stuff and will be even more serious stuff in the future.

Apparently it was on Slush and it was mined by Core spoofing the version bit. For the purpose of "getting the miners to vote" and they would change the daemon in due time if we got close to a fork.
Maybe some people will start to realise that the voting mechanism isn't proof of a certain behaviour in the miner? that this voting thing is not enforced and there is no safe mechanism behind right now?
I wouldn't expect many around here or much less in *redacted* to wake up to actual facts.

Firstly I think it should be made clear, even in the proposal if possible, that the solution is not intended to be definitive.
Bitcoin is still in early stages. These proposals are all based on conjectures about adoption, usages and equilibriums that we really cannot predict more than a few years down the line.
Secondly we should relax about the impending disaster drama regarding adoption because of the current limit. It's way overblown maybe because of the coordinated spam attack that already happened and the next one coming supposedly next month, from a company using VC capital to flood the blockchain for self-promotion. It will go away.
Bitcoin is not anywhere near final. The scenario of mass adoption that would "crash land" the system is incompatible with the current state of development. If we need to go through a number of bumps then so be it, maybe they are necessary for the progress of this technology. Much worse would it be to overstretch the current limitations of the system.
@_date: 2015-08-23 10:37:43
Core have the upper hand. Only inaction can cause them to lose Bitcoin to an ignorant mob led by a con artist. And even through inaction they'd still have odds on them right now.
IMO they should crush these hacks as soon as possible so Bitcoin doesn't continue to lose credibility at an alarming rate as a project.
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:21:14
So basically you want to weed out miners who are not competitive with your bandwidth and your infrastructure?
I see all that and it's interesting as a data point. However it's important to the network that mining is not limited to operations that have this sort of connectivity.
I hope you can see the big picture here because Bitcoin as a whole can suffer for the tunnel vision of the different actors.
@_date: 2015-08-26 16:29:39
Ok, it would be useful if they made a statement because people will pre-emptively get anxious about having BTC in exchanges at all.
Personally I think they would gain a distinct advantage if they committed to support both Core and XT in the event that their chains continue whatever their status is.

This is part of the philosophical split in the core of the community.
Right wing libertarians conflate property and freedom, whereas minarchists, ancaps and anarchists generally don't. When there's conflict between property rights and anonymous transactions that cannot be centrally controlled or policed, they have a dilemma there.
Classic libertarians are simply scared that people can keep a decentralised network that cannot be controlled. It's like the government is scared of private  communications and free speech.
The mindset of these guys in a nutshell, from the article:


So yeah, when it comes to property the Libertarians run to the government asking for help. And they are ready to sacrifice private, anonymous transactions between individuals in order to get this help from daddy State.

In other words he thinks Bitcoin ATMs are pointless and what we need is video-conferencing Bitcoin embassies. With current BTC adoption it looks to me like a failed business model. Gigantic costs and resistance to fees: already bad with ATMs, much worse with dedicated video-conferencing.

Yeah, there's some to this.
- Mike backs the fork that puts him in absolute charge (unsurprising if you have read his stuff in the past)
- payment processors back the trade-offs that favour the Bitcoin model of being pre-eminently a payment processor platform
- miners back giving more governance power to miners
- core devs back maintaining the decision strictly within Core
- devs back their own proposals
- users back their own vision or interest in Bitcoin

No. As a user you don't have this alternative.
Support to XT and support to cherry-picked XT CANNOT BE TOLD APART in the protocol, and even in conversation in the forums it would be dumbed down to the common denominator.
They'll probably try to manipulate you into thinking you can, though.
You can participate in the conversation about other alternatives, that's all you can do.
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:35:00
It's not what most people understand for an altcoin but it would be a useful definition consistent with reality.
Personally I don't care that much. I think the term "altcoin" is candid with XT. What the people behind XT are trying is a lot more dishonest than just launching an altcoin superficially very similar to Bitcoin. That would be just fine IMO, whoever wants a considerably different trade-off to current Bitcoin with NSAcoin could just join them from scratch, maybe they'd get some mining power behind from obsolete ASICs like happens with other SHA-coins.

I don't know enough about your set-up, but the traffic looks like there's something else.

I don't believe for a second the development of that miner has been cheap. It's not as trivial as some may think to develop and optimise that sort of machinery, and to have the manufacturing pipeline churning. There are significant non-recurring costs to recoup.

Garzik could really improve his explanations.
Anyway, what I'm guessing is this rather than OPs interpretation:
1- collect votes
2- sort votes
3- remove top 20% and bottom 20% (by discarding individual votes according to their sorted order, or at least that seems the most obvious option rather than by range %)
4- from the rest, pick the most common
5- since there might be several candidates with the same number of max votes, pick the lowest of them (tie-breaker)
6- if &lt;1MB (lower boundary), then the new max blocksize is 1MB  (although maybe the votes out of range are invalid instead)
7- if &gt;32MB (upper boundary), then the new max blocksize is 32MB (ditto)
8- otherwise, the winner is the candidate picked in 5
Since this allows for quite some gaming of the vote, I guess he will discretise the range. This way there are just a bunch of options.
Any voting system looking at percentiles might be problematic if the different factions are too far departed in their preferences. But that's always going to be the case with any system really.

Yep but what you are saying here is equivalent to, for instance, saying "Bitcoin is a crypto" in is an insult, simply because the general consensus in that sub about cryptos is negative. (Let's assume for the sake of argument that the exact range of what a crypto was slightly contested - or there was a division in "crypto vs virtual currency" camps or something like that).
A particular misguided opinion of the majority in this sub does not make "altcoin" an insulting concept.

The system cannot work with blocks smaller than the header, and voting would also be impossible after that.
They are possible but the system cannot take them, they are also not valid blocks.
@_date: 2015-08-23 18:43:33
Big blocks reduce the choice of places to run a pool. Running a pool means where the block ends (the full block, not the header). 
A war of attrition on bandwidth will crowd out most places by economic pressure. Honestly I think I'm repeating myself here.
If you make bandwidth a big factor it will weed out all but a few places by the effect of competition.

By the way Mike Hearn is not one of the 5 "official" Core Devs.

It would take me a long time to answer these questions fully. This subject is a lot more complex than most people are willing to believe.
Going briefly on the straightforward part:
- I might be in a position to influence the pool owner. Can't say more about this for privacy reasons.
- Faking the version string is a sensible thing to do if it crushes XT. Not the only possible strategy though.
- Obviously I will be in non-XT no matter what. If that ever got destroyed, as if nominal Bitcoin got destroyed, I will have to migrate elsewhere completely. The XT vision is absolutely pointless and toxic to me.
The reasoning is the part that would take me way too long to explain here. I'm not going to point you to a bunch of older posts and links and let you read that, I think that wouldn't be a respectful way to deal with it, so I will just go to sleep because I have stuff to do early in the morning.

Ok, but why is that? I've been looking and haven't found anything that would stop, for instance, 128MB blocks from happening in the message format. There's a 32 bit unsigned integer for length, but that allows for 4GiB lenghts. So what else is there in the format imposing a 32MB restriction? (note that I think 32MB is probably too high to even consider at this stage, but that's not relevant to this particular point).
@_date: 2015-08-25 10:45:47
For sure BIP101 doesn't address that 8GiB is outside of the limits of the current message format, but I don't think there's a problem with say 2GiB in terms of format. The size of the message payload is described by an uint32_t, so that can address up to 4GiB. Or maybe there's another limitation I'm missing right now?
In any case railroading the blocksize calendar up to anywhere close to that right now sounds like madness to me. I'm not a fan of BIP101 although I understand many people seem to like it and would want it leaving the rest of XT out.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:15:56
I don't think BIP 101 is dangerous. Not at all. It just lifts the limit effectively so much that there's no point in having a limit. And most Core devs disagree that's a good idea at the moment.
What I don't like is asking people to support a proposal without reading it "if they support bigger blocks" - that's textbook manipulation and I object to that.
BIP 101 is not BitcoinXT though, the latter includes many things NACKed to hell by other devs, which would be long to explain here but it has been brought up in many places recently.
Using the blocksize panic to push BitcoinXT is a whole other level of scummy.
In fact if Core lifted substantially the blocksize limit or implemented BIP 101 (which I don't like, but still) they would deactivate this "coup attempt" by BitcoinXT. Anyway, I don't think this is the healthy and civil way to do things. This shows the toxic size of the egos of some people in the community.

It doesn't matter, Mike will take your "XT vote" in your node's agent string and take political advantage of it ("proof of support to his entire agenda"). Let alone if you manage to mine a block and put the vote in it.
If you want to support bigger blocks rally for adding this vote to the coinbase scriptSig like many are doing now, or edit consensus.h to add a zero to it (instant 10MB block support!).
But the current thing is a war of factions, make no mistake.

That's interesting. Why such huge peaks in transmission like once or twice a day? it doesn't seem to be running very well at all, if that means it's catching up on propagation not happening for long periods.

@_date: 2015-08-17 14:47:09
Nope, but what you can do is adding some ad-hoc rejection of blocks to ignore the longest chain that appears not to be XT. This is more or less equivalent to checkpointing (something that Mike Hearn has also hinted about in the past). At this point it would be a full-fledged "altfork".
There are caveats but certainly checkpointing is doable, the problem is then to argue that your chain is the most legit vs the Core one when you needed a checkpoint to have nodes on it.

If miners didn't have the current block reward, transactions would need to cost over $20 each just to break even in their operation. So for now they live on this, maybe in the future they have a more sustainable model with either more reward per raw transaction or cheaper operation to include more transactions or most likely a combination of these. Otherwise the model will just collapse.

Yeah, because liquidity in an exchange depends just on one of the assets when they can be converted at the blink of an eye. Knowing what we know now about the internal operation of MtGox. Not to mention you didn't even specify that at all.
At best you are loud-mouthed and completely incapable of auditing an exchange. At worst you are a fraudster.
Your "apology" started off by *doubling down* in that you were "right". 
What winds me up about this is how indignant you got when you got hit by the Bitcoinica fiasco and then Amir simply didn't care about your particular case. What you did is much, much worse. You directly misled people into trusting a fraudulent operation. And to think I gave Amir shit for that.

Changing the constant in consensus.h is an alternative.
Leaving things as is until the next few workshops coming up during the next 2 months is another alternative. Especially considering we are still at about half capacity and the fee market hasn't even been tested at all. Many more alternatives are already in the works, some with concrete proposals.
The problem is fabricated to rush in a solution that includes many other controversial changes that were previously rejected from Core. It's an absolutely shit way of managing things, it's dangerous and it's toxic to the whole project and community.

That is completely consistent with the classic right wing libertarian mindset. Their emphasis in property is strong and this includes policing, although there's an equilibrium to keep there I guess. The State is there for defending the borders and the Rule of Law (so far so good). But their emphasis in property is such that they will happily trade freedom of private transaction and communication to have better policing of property. They want their chargebacks. Their "follow-the-money" policing. Which implies they want their AML+KYC regulations, too.

The idea is interesting but seems unenforceable to me as you describe it here.
First the contract should be able to specify what legit "Bitcoin" is in a future scenario with more than one chain being actively supported. And it would need to do this distinction without even knowing what the criteria for division is in every possible case.
What seems more plausible to me, is that *once a schism fork happens then people certainly can make such distinctions and I'm pretty sure they would*, post fact and on characteristics that they can readily measure.

The war is declared, maybe you haven't been paying attention.
"Votes" are a farce. Currently there is no proper credible consensus mechanism other than orphaning invalid blocks. Not even something moderately credible that could be made with PoS. There's nothing right now, just setting a version that doesn't even mean that your miner runs that particular untested version of the protocol.
So currently only "consensus" happens after a fork. Whether that's a problem, I'm not entirely sure. Orphaning blocks is just that, declaring that you vote against. I believe there were other ideas to introduce governance mechanisms that have a semblance of credibility but AFAIK there's nothing implemented.
The ignorance of this reality is killing Bitcoin.

I agree it seems misguiding, but currently the definition of altcoin is fuzzy enough that it could be argued. "An altcoin is a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin", surely the current blockchain is an inseparable part of what makes current Bitcoin?
This is a complex subject because since "BitcoinXT" labeled itself differently, even though they included "Bitcoin" in the name, they already conceded to be a different thing from Bitcoin. This war of semantics is complex, if you call it a "forkcoin" (we'd have to define that properly) then you have to concede that every version of the code introducing a soft or hard fork to be "a different forkcoin of the previous" and then... who has the legitimacy to carry the brand name "Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2015-08-23 02:50:36
That's what I call useless terminology.
If essentially every fork ever intentionally introduced cannot be called anything "until it activates" then we are missing a word. That word is for now "fork".

Maybe, but again doing this without enough time in advance to phase them out it will probably cause them to revolt. Note that they can just reject protocol changes and they would be running the strongest and most solid blockchain in the world, and "neo-Bitcoin" would be a weakling in comparison. It's hard to compete with that. There needs to be governance to do something remotely as drastic as that, which is much more than the current debate. And this is already a shitstorm.
@_date: 2015-08-23 11:22:26
Anyone who understands the protocol (not just the code) knows that the only real, solid mechanism of the blockchain is mining power POST-FORK. The rest rely on coordination and good will. These are completely shot.
Trying to force a fork without coordination based on measures that are known to be flaky is an attack on the project, plain and simple. Malicious software. Pretty much as if a botnet faked to be miners and nodes and tried a network attack.

@_date: 2015-08-11 10:19:56
I think the terminology of hardfork and softfork has some sentiment charged into it that can be misguiding.
Surely "hard" sounds more serious and worrisome than "soft" but arguably a softfork can be more dangerous long term than a hardfork. A Hardfork forces immediate resolution (even if it's just choosing a blockchain) while a softfork can creep a change into the system that makes itself very hard to correct/alter over time and that can be more challenging for the Bitcoin ecosystem to manage.
A softfork is arguably more likely to cause a community and ecosystem split than a hardfork.
BTW a hardfork happened in the update from 0.7 to 0.8 in March 2013 and was then "managed" via 0.8.1 to give more time for updating clients. It was introduced by Gavin with the DB update that effectively allowed previously "invalid blocks" (regardless of whether they were invalid by design or via a bug in the system). The 1MB "temporary anti-DOS cap" from 2010 introduced by Satoshi was a softfork and has proven a lot harder to deal with now.
Op says:


I think he shouldn't have said "hard fork" there, but simply "fork". All forks are definite breaks from the statu quo blockchain and how *serious* this break is depends on many considerations and "hard" is not necessarily more *serious* than "soft".

This works on the assumption that Mark isn't grossly incompetent at trading as well as running an exchange. Seems to me like he may or may not be, and likely he is.
If forensics can gather evidence of his trades we'll find out. My guess is that he was short on coins early and chickened out way before the bubble hit.
There's also this thing that sometime in late 2013/early 2014 a massive backlog of BTC started building up. I'd say he was selling BTC he didn't have to build up on fiat, rather than buying BTC with fiat he didn't have. Based on Adam's posts, his operation was expensive and there was no way fees were paying for it.

The code of redacted specifies a fork pretty much like these are done every time they don't happen by accident: setting up a trigger to activate the differing code in a future block.
The nature of this "altfork" (Feathercoin is another) is unprecedented in that nobody tried to brazenly appropriate the brand and the community of the original project. This makes it certainly more hostile and despicable than Feathercoin, and certainly much worse than an altcoin which are a legitimate thing when the differences in philosophy are big enough. If they had any shame they'd launch theirs.
You can debate that "altforks" are distinct enough from the remaining altcoins as to merit a category.
Core devs should have a meeting about how to protect the system from what basically is an organised attack with nodes and miners pretending to be legitimate but having malicious code in them. Not taking action is costing the whole project a lot of credibility. A basic first step would be to specifically orphan BIP 101 versioned blocks and stop propagating them as well (a simple change in the block rules). I wouldn't bother with addressing nodes since at the moment are nothing but a propaganda tool that has zero legitimacy anyway since anyone can run a number of them at almost no cost (with pseudonode you don't even need much disk space or bandwidth).
Earlier or later than this, at their own judgement, Gavin Andresen should be stripped from any affiliation with the remainder of the "official" dev team (privileges in the repo included, of course). Whether we like it or not, providing personal platforms to developers makes them points of failure to the whole project. There should be some funding effort so devs don't need to go on talks and celebrity campaigns to whore themselves out and make some money. This promotes behaviour that is entirely toxic to Bitcoin as it personalises the project. Devs having self-promotion platforms in relation to Bitcoin should be a no-no, even if it's just blogs with their mug all over the place and airbrushed pictures of themselves looking pensive. Bitcoin should be as faceless as possible and "followers" should solve their daddy issues and get behind the values of Bitcoin that matter. Running in datacenters or being filtered and controlled by financial corporations are not among them.

This market is not working and cannot be expected to work. Best we can do is have some people oppose the crossing of some red lines, otherwise we will continue crossing them. For starters there are serious contradictions in the utility curves of different factions and actors, so the market cannot possibly work for all of them, maybe not even for the majority of them. Nodes currently run on a volunteer basis, with just around a dozen being run by services that might profit from them, all of them in a few selected jurisdictions. This for many of us is not acceptable already and should be resolved rather than allowed to deteriorate further.
Orphaned blocks mean slower transactions, double spends in confirmed blocks, and accidental or malicious charge-backs among other things. It also means that miners will end up just ignoring some protocol soft rules like those of block size, which is something they can do single-handedly, and it will cause a huge amount of uncertainty in the future of the system.
It's very naive to expect it to just work when there is no incentive to protect some characteristics that are indispensable to keep BTC working in a pseudonymous, decentralised, neutral fashion.
The protocol and its hard and soft rules need adjustments so that the resources markets work better than they are doing currently.
@_date: 2015-08-27 09:49:11
I see. You don't seem to have a problem with the lower boundary cap though, why is that? surely if you remove one you can remove the other, as the system can take infinitely big blocks just as impossibly as infinitely small blocks.
We don't need to make predictions about what will destabilise the debate more. Just propose BIP xxx and see which one is preferred.
In BIP 100 which is what we are talking about, there is a 32MB cap and Garzik put it there.

Indeed, and actually miners don't need devs to just softfork if they so decide. As there is political organisation in the dev and in the commerce front nobody should be surprised that the bigger miners are already meeting and discussing how to act.
@_date: 2015-08-31 17:04:40
Yep, but generally speaking this only affects non-consensus rules.
To affect consensus rules they'd have to effectively isolate miners significantly and you need a high percentage of the network to do that. Maybe when propagation is harder (bigger blocks having to go through bottle necks) and fewer nodes, then network attacks can be more effective, but currently they're not.

One must remember that above winning the mining majority this is about winning the economic majority (although the two are related, the loser would immediately be vulnerable to attacks from the bigger pools in the winner and money doesn't like that).
This effort to win the economic majority is mostly political, through social engineering. And this has started already and even officially so with the infamous blog post "Bitcoin has forked".
To a degree this is unprecedented so no name truly captures the reality of it. Because Feathercoin technically did the same, but they had the decency not to try to usurp the name and the business of Litecoin.

Both upstream and downstream are critical for propagation. Typically upstream is already limited, so having that cut is the most problematic.
I like the moderate throttling during catch up because it doesn't hurt the latency of the network, and that's the most important thing.
Right now there's a sort of throttling: closing the node. When you turn it back on it will catch up and start serving, and it will do so at best effort instead of randomly throttled. The network can do better guesses and work better this way.
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:50:02

The current code in XT doesn't make a clear separation of these chains. This means a dirty fork so long as anything survived in the other chain, and potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. I can't even begin to imagine the legal clusterfuck just for the usage of the term "Bitcoin" and for not honouring the coins in the other side of the chain, or transactions that randomly made it in one chain and not the other.
If they made them clean (mutually incompatible txs) then probably they would be making it more likely to happen. If they don't, and it ends up happening, it will be a shitstorm of unprecedented proportions.

There's a big discrepancy between hashing power and bandwidth. There could be more hashing power in places relatively poorly connected than the other way around.

It has been discussed ad nauseam. You certainly don't want the bulk of the nodes to be in a few privileged places, let alone the miners. It makes the system progressively more vulnerable.
So yeah, when talking about broadband in this context it makes no sense to focus in the places that are already ahead. You would focus in the rural areas that are already out of the picture as things stand and are unlikely to catch up in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2015-08-19 12:45:50
That would be precisely a checkpoint, which I mentioned in the messages above.
If you understand what a checkpoint essentially is (no need to go into much more technical detail) you can understand what Mike Hearn means here: 
Cryptographic consensus is impossible to guarantee at the time of the hostile fork, so if they actually get the weaker chain they can just carry on ignoring that.
There are more implications to this of course, but long story short, yes, Bitcoin can actually split and this will likely mean carnage in the market like we haven't even seen before. No matter how much we wish that away and how strongly we downvote people for pointing out this technical fact.

I'm not sure what do you mean mate, it's not me who proposed overriding the longest chain.
There is no such thing as "the longest XT chain" in this scenario. Both chains would be Bitcoin chains. The regular, non XT chain would also validate as an XT chain. In the scenario that it's longer, Hearn advocates overriding it with a checkpoint.

It would trigger a fork that would only orphan the blocks of the idiots who actually run trueXT. The incentive is the reduction of competition to make blocks until the poor saps react and start behaving again.

I'm not sure this is very relevant to Bitcoin, to be completely honest.
@_date: 2015-08-30 15:00:39
The strategy is to sell the fork of the blockchain as if it was a mere fork of the software, when it's multiplying the monetary base. This and the "blockchain technologies" pitch is aimed at having centrally backed tokens working a lot like Ripple but on a blockchain, on the fantasy that because something is in a blockchain that alone guarantees it's not centrally controlled (completely misguiding notion).
If Bitcoin is undermined as a single reference blockchain its store of value function is jeopardised. It would be different if these blockchains stored smart contracts, domain names or something else other than currency. But they are going for Bitcoin as non arbitrarily inflationary currency.
On the other hand - but this is a different issue - reducing the number of nodes and pools to manageable jurisdictions can also end with neutral, censorship-free transactions.
Edited for typo.

A contentious fork is possible.
BIP 101 can only fork cleanly if Core collaborates, either passively or actively. If Core reacts to this hostile takeover attempt, and there are several ways to react to it, and I don't think it's by any means unlikely... then the whole system is going to suffer. Badly.
I don't think I can put it in simpler terms than this.
Mike Hearn's strategy is based in that "they don't want the whole system to go to shit so they will play along and accept everything I'm trying to impose on them" (there are several things that are NOT MINOR in BitcoinXT other than BIP 101).
If you don't believe me listen to him: 
If this thing keeps growing until there's real danger of it going down, we're going to tank and we're going to tank badly.

No, if the "old chain" produces a "longer chain" (a chain with more accumulated difficulty) then XT nodes and Core nodes both will agree this is "the right chain". That's how it works. 
However if the longer chain had a block invalid for Core (for instance, bigger than 1MB after Jan 11th 2016) then Core wouldn't recognise that chain because the block is invalid for them (not the other way around). In this case Core would continue with it's own chain, but if at any point Core overtook XT, XT nodes would discard their chain and go for the longer one.
To force a fork with less mining power XT would need to introduce a checkpoint or some equivalent mechanism (not currently in place).
I don't know if I explained it very clearly... long story short you don't have "2 chains" if both are valid, that situation is only temporary until the tie breaks and whichever is longer will be "the chain", that's the basic principle of the blockchain. That's why the only way for there to be two chains stably after a fork between XT and Core (as they are defined right now) is that the longer one contains a block bigger than 1MB which will be valid for XT in the future and presumably not for Core. Then each version would see just one longer valid chain.

Winning and losing are artificial concepts for hashing power.

@_date: 2015-08-27 09:41:58
It really isn't irrelevant. Propagation *could* stop being reliably low latency if a number of nodes throttle down and the already big traffic numbers are an incentive to do so. I'm not following Monero closely but I suspect their traffic requirements are currently much lower.
And also as I said before, I'm not ruling it out. I just think such a change needs to be introduced carefully.

I've been around for ~5 years, and I strongly believe that Bitcoin wouldn't be around if the standards of behaviour within active devs had been like this.
By not being around I mean the most plausible scenario of "napsterisation": although Bitcoin has the head start, the drive and the bigger economic support, they can fuck it up badly enough that other crypto dominated by people with more sense becomes the reference.
People don't seem to be aware that Bitcoin has been "saved" by devs a few times already.
So no, Bitcoin is not around for some stupid honey badger meme nonsense that makes it unbreakable, it's around because of the drive, the know-how and the hard work of a bunch of people that are being seriously undermined now for the first time.

If the fork happens I'm quite convinced it will last.
Mike Hearn already said he would force the fork even in a shorter chain using checkpoints if it came to that. So that's pretty much decided.
I'm pretty convinced that the rest of the devs won't contribute to the repo controlled by Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen. They would do whatever instead, likely just staying in their chain and if for whatever reason their hashing power became precarious they would probably do a PoW reset to a different algorithm. This is pure speculation but I seriously doubt they'd just stay idle when their vision of Bitcoin also has a lot of following and XT deviates from it increasingly.
The main reason I think an eventual fork is likely to last is that both visions have plenty of support even if it's maybe from different backgrounds or even geographically split.
I think taking for granted that there would be a quick one-true-winner in the event of a schism fork is wishful thinking whatever side you support. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:42:22
We are talking about the size of each block, not the whole blockchain.
The target of 8GB/block in BIP101/BitcoinXT means the blockchain grows 8GB every ~10 minutes. That'd be in around 20 years time, before that it'd be doubling from 8MB every 2 years.
It requires a fork so the nodes do anything other than continuing with the plan of doubling MAX_BLOCK_SIZE every 2 years for 20 years. That is, if BitcoinXT gets its way and takes over the blockchain.

No, no different real-world fiat values. These coins are redeemable into main-blockchain coins. You can consider them worth different amounts like you can consider tainted coins to be worth different amounts. This is not an argument that invalidates neither sidechains nor bitcoins, it's  more like baseless scaremongering.
If you don't tie a huge share of your balance to a single sidechain on any given time, the difference for you is absolutely negligible. You can even be better off as the sidechain will be more private and also cheaper in terms of commissions.

Yep, the situation is precarious because mainstream people don't push for decentralized miners as when you notice about that you're already PayPal. As long as there's no market for resources within the system it's just some people fighting for it. Which is part of the market, too.


We're not protecting them per se. We need to figure it out little by little if block propagation is good enough because it's them that may overpower and orphan big blocks from better connected areas. High orphan rates means shit system, and the market cannot correct this as it doesn't have the tools or global visibility to do so. A market for space in the block will work a lot better since it's symmetric and visible, although it also has problems. Basically we have to find a balance between all these factors, in other words set up a market for resources that works. We don't have that.

Nope, that's not correct. In fact it's closer to the exact opposite of that.
- Soft fork -&gt; more restrictive rules (or equally restrictive rules). New blocks will also be valid for older nodes that are not updated.
- Hard fork -&gt; less restrictive rules. New blocks may be invalid for older nodes, and they will reject them.
The terminology is a bit counter-intuitive but that's the way it is.
There are tricks to introduce features on a soft fork using bitcoin script, so that older blocks will accept the blocks despite not "knowing" the new functionality. This happened with P2SH.
In general forks are a dangerous thing to do. In general, playing with the block validity rules should be avoided, but then again Bitcoin is still in early days.
The problem we have is that some decisions are taken on whatever is the zeitgeist of the moment. When Satoshi introduced the 1MB limit, people were worrying about storage and about the blockchain getting too big. The one-true-way to use bitcoin was to run BitcoinQT, and download the whole blockchain. Now people are panicky about the number of transactions that can happen in the blockchain in real time as there was no other way to deal with bitcoins. In the meanwhile we had other discussions like "dust yes or no", Satoshidice being considered spam, etc etc also related with the fact that the blockchain gets bigger and there is no real fee market, as block generation is still so much more than the usual fees in a block.

From the several actors of Bitcoinspace, miners are the one with the most legitimacy to vote on what they will have to put through. Not users, not cartels of corporations, not exchanges.
It's not perfect but when it comes to block size and transaction inclusion, miners could end up overriding parameters if they felt stretched out. We have to avoid that miners collude, and encourage more nodes and more pools.

There are two meetings/workshops on scalability coming soon, and the block size is averaging about 500KB. I don't think there is a real need to panic and push a solution that could be incompatible with an incoming decision and deemed worse by the core devs.
It's not like the blockchain will self-destruct if a few blocks are full up to the blocksize limit and some transactions need to wait an extra block. 
The whole schism is fabricated to push a whole agenda taking advantage of the apparent turmoil in the community. Otherwise it wouldn't be the whole XT but just the related bit (BIP 101).

You don't see that if the fastest path to Korea was a direct connection then BGP would find that?
Your assumption is then that you can connect faster to Korea than the Internet, through the internet, in either terms of latency or bandwidth or both. Maybe you can improve on BGP in terms of having a dedicated low bandwidth but low latency link.
Miners already have hashing and nodes in separate computers, for sure. They are running ASICs.
If they outsource the pool connection off-site then they'd have their miners and their pools in different jurisdictions. I can understand why this might be a problem for some.
Long story short, to see if this works you need to progress towards bigger blocks in a controlled way, especially now that there is a big gap between block reward and fees. If you look at block sizes they look increasingly variable and jagged. Maybe some miners simply can't or don't want to move their pools to well connected places and we cannot conclude here why or if it will be a good thing to try to take them out of the game overnight.

It's perfectly evitable, just a matter of culture. If the community accepts the usurpation of the blockchain as a 'good thing', then yeah it's game over for BTC as a store of value. Maybe try again with a wiser community.
Open source software and an open ledger are radically different things. For instance, it's not the same if I open my accounts for everyone to see, or I open my accounts for everyone to withdraw from my money or inflate it. The latter is retarded and suicidal. If the community cannot see through that I guess there's a void for some of us to fill in elsewhere.

If you put a cap so high that miners will include much less than the cap and will eventually collude to soft-fork down, then the cap is completely useless. The cap is supposed to improve propagation, orphan rates and tx inclusion by encouraging different pools to behave similarly with regards to block size.

I recently had to take 1 node off for maintenance for 1 day and it was back up synced in a matter of minutes. Maybe 5 minutes or so. It's not a very powerful computer and the connection is average as well.

Considering BitcoinXT "an altcoin" is possibly misguiding, but not "insulting". 
@_date: 2015-08-20 21:20:02
The idea is obvious.
Vote as it stands is an afterthought. There is no safe voting mechanism, and therefore no half-way decent manner to make such a fork safe without collaboration and coordination.
With the current mechanisms an organised fight for winning over control of the blockchain spells absolute disaster. It will be total carnage if it happens like this.

He said that forks are not forks if they are activated in the future, that's the bit I was talking about.
Most forks are introduced so that they activate in the future, or else it would be a nightmare for the upgrade to catch on. Very especially hard forks. The times that they had been introduced activated it was an accident and it was a disaster.

There's a full fledged social engineering campaign to make people believe BitcoinXT equates larger blocks, and a blockchain ledger fork is something as trivial and safe as a github fork.
The changes, the blog posts and the interventions and postings make it a coordinated effort, to which many people have voluntarily joined (in many cases without being particularly aware of the implications of the fork and the new features sneaked in).
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:12:29
The votes all weight the same. They take into account the hashing power from the fact that they did win the block, so in average power is implied on simply the number of votes.
Garzik will have to disambiguate that with code. It feels certainly arbitrary to me to take what amounts to be close to the percentile 20 of a vote. This usage of percentiles makes more sense when dealing with a hard statistic like previous block sizes. With votes it's just a rather pointless distortion IMO, but miners knowing the system can vote accordingly. So not a deal breaker. Very quick degeneration of the constants is also limited by the minimum, the maximum, and the variation limits.
I'd personally do something like this if we're going to use a "miner vote" approach:

They will, but it will be a lot safer to have the web server and the bitcoind in different places and communicate strictly through JSONRPC or something else limited strictly to the kind of requests you will need. Otherwise your web server will announce itself in the Bitcoin P2P network and it will be port-scanned, and found to be a public web server and it will be attacked. Very soon, too. Note that web servers typically have a huge attack surface with very well known and exploited security holes (a lot of effort is put by the hacker community to find zero-days for the software found in web servers, because it's so profitable). The attack then becomes almost automatic (there are some completely automated attacks too).
So... having said that, yep, have a look at these links.
@_date: 2015-08-21 15:09:34
If devs and a number of nodes, miners form separate factions and start actively attacking each other at all levels, I don't think Bitcoin will survive it and remain the reference crypto. It will devalue in all measures most importantly in credibility.

You are imagining an inside job where people need to be at the particular location, which is nothing like reality in most cyberattacks.
Whoever did it, probably had prior knowledge of the infrastructure acquired from the inside. This is a very common pattern (ex-employees, contractors, etc). Knowing this vulnerability would be exploitable allows to prevent intrusion detection systems which would be triggered by probing each target.
Pretty likely it's both things: semi-inside job and common vulnerability. Exploiting the common vulnerability without prior knowledge is still possible but much harder and therefore more unlikely.
I also wouldn't expect an honest post-mortem detailing the exploited vulnerability from these people. It's possible but out of character IMO.
Pronouns are guesses here because I don't know how many actors participated. So they, he, her etc is just a guess.

If you mean as an attack vector then yes, it could happen temporarily. If growing the block can make the competition orphan more blocks than you then it can be used, however generally the miners are disorganised (if there are enough) and currently making smaller blocks makes more individual sense than making bigger blocks.

It is, but even greater centralisation imposed through decisions like these may have long-term repercussions. I simply advocate for prudence in this respect (talking about 8MB blocks here not XT, not BIP101 and not 1.1MB blocks).
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:48:36
I honestly doubt that. When bandwidth becomes a strong factor pools will just move to the very best places and by being close to each other it will be very hard to compete from outside.
As soon as pools predominantly move to the model of having hashing elsewhere the effort to just change the location of the pool server is minimal. The short term, individual incentives don't align with the long term, global incentives (at least for the kind of decentralised Bitcoin I believe in).
@_date: 2015-08-24 09:44:32
Moore's law doesn't apply to network propagation. In any case you should never anticipate that decades in advance.
ILBT paints a very optimistic picture of what size can the blocks be and still get properly propagated to enough different places in the world that are not in the most bandwidth-latency competitive areas.
Current blockchain behaviour suggests many miners would have to move their pools to stay in the game with much bigger blocks.
The increase shouldn't be dramatic and shouldn't try to prevent further changes down the line given the state of the project, which by no means looks stable enough to be set on stone.
I think you have completely ignored the important bits in these articles to focus in the "we could have huge blocks" red herring.

There's one caveat to that. I don't think many miners who nominally oppose Bitcoin Core actually trust to run any other implementations (let alone BU) to make their blocks. They'd probably split the chain by accident, including transactions with a SegWit dependency in their inputs.

The strategy from [here]( will work though, you can "launder" by using a "legit" service like another exchange and unless they start collaborating and whitelisting, that won't get you banned. But obvious mixers will get you banned for sure according to reports.

This is fact, there is no solid voting mechanism or even a moderately plausible contract system so that miners cannot forge votes that they won't follow through.
People are passing it like it was a solid mechanism as the blockchain consensus itself. Simply because they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about.
Everybody who knows a bit about the actual protocol also knows this mechanism is very risky and untested and there can be a real split (esp. if Mike follows through with his threat to put checkpoints and ignore the longer blockchain in his altfork).

And Northern Ireland. The most pro-EU areas are London and the South-East.
If there is a Brexit, then Scotland leaving would imply a very real border that would be policed like any EU border, at the end of the day they risk more getting out of the UK with a real border (and without the ability to negotiate themselves any agreements) than getting out of the EU.
I'm rather optimistic if Brexit does happen, but I don't think it will.

It's certainly a factor. If you didn't have 3-4 huge stratum pools with the same vulnerability (whatever it was) then this could not happen. It would have required a much wider attack.


And this would have been a tiny attack in comparison with much less impact. Just the satoshis lost until detection.

Politics influence markets. Both you and OP seem to be denying this obvious fact and sadly it's pretty true.
Pretty certain politics is influencing Bitcoin right now very strongly by blocking SegWit and threatening a contentious HF.
Just because we like to pretend it won't matter it doesn't mean it's true. "Compromises" have already been offered and they have shaped the latest crop of proposals, no doubt about that.
Do I think politicians should be making the technical decisions? fuck no. But politics affects almost everything and certainly they do affect Bitcoin. They also affect the trade of gold or oil. Nothing that affects large groups of people will escape the effect of politics.

You don't even need that. You only need a properly timed attack - with current parameters, during the last block of the series will do -  have difficulty decrease substantially and have a proper hijack with enough power backing you.
I think this is perfectly feasible with 100-200K US$ investment. You just need the incentive.

The existence of optimisations that conflict with the best service in terms of transaction inclusion is very problematic, and clearly a flaw in the PoW mechanism, but I agree the word "attack" is loaded.

Amortisation is as big a cost if not bigger in the majority of the cases. At current mining difficulty and bc prices, by the time these FPGAS or GPUs have paid for themselves, there will be much faster devices that will be much more profitable. With rising difficulty levels they may well never pay for themselves.
Right now, breaking even on new equipment for mining you buy now looks unlikely. Difficulty is on the rise again, bringing diminishing returns. Unless prices go 10+ US$ again, then all but the worst rigs will be profitable.
Right now I'm sure most rigs run at a loss. Either because they don't know, or because someone else pays the bills (and/or the rigs), or because they are simply donating their computing power to make bitcoin safer. I'm glad there are people doing that and I'm willing to be one, but thinking of it as a long term investment is pretty crazy now. Let's be honest here.

Thanks for your update.


This is something you'd have to guarantee somehow. Can your operation scale? would you be able to survive massive hardware failure? what kind of insurance do you have? (ie what happens if your main operation HQ burns down). You say everything is legit and I'm willing to believe you, however it's just your word there supporting it.


Let's say you really don't have any risks of being unable to provide the service in the future. You still say you can undercut by 20% the most efficient mining device in existence (in terms of ROI, amortisation) even bought second hand at 50% of the market price and disregarding the risk of hardware failure completely. Does that sound sustainable to you?

Agreed on 2 and 3, but if you take into consideration the global money supply vs bitcoin money supply, these transactions would equate to thousands of dollars each. Obviously this doesn't work this way since bitcoins are not valued anywhere near their proportional ratio, but theoretically the system would have to do with transactions this size and much smaller massively if it went mainstream.

Not only that, but thinking in terms of US$ pressures the value down. So maybe not a great idea in the first place. We all know more or less the range it's moving around. More than that, thinking in exchanging it immediately to US$ or any other currency is a really, really bad idea for the project long term.

Likelihood is not a mathematical measure any more when you factor human  behaviour.
If by amassing 51% computing power you can not only double-spend a number of coins you previously owned, but basically all coins in existence, then you can justify a massive investment to do it. Notice that it won't even be deemed illegal in most places as bitcoins are not legal tender. One could afford to bribe pool operators, run DDoS attacks, buy whole datacenters, buy hashing power in one of these new pay-to-mine sites... to perform a sync attack given that the bounty would be estimated at many millions of dollars.
This is a common pattern in many vulnerabilities: assuming something is random when it can be engineered from the outside. This is why, for instance, proof-of-work cannot be any expensive (and potentially useful) computation.
@_date: 2012-02-23 12:28:17
Yes and no.
If they produce a limited-but-sufficient amount of them, then initially difficulty would go up, then automatically a lot of miners more would be running at a significant loss, panic-sell and a collapse in difficulty would ensue. Game changers usually produce booms and busts and if you are an early adopter you could make a killing.
It all depends on production and distribution rates, and demand. Obviously speculation on the value of bitcoins would be affected by this and make everything very unpredictable.
@_date: 2012-10-09 09:28:34

These are FPGA based (the one in the picture is the standard minirig, they also brought single(s?) and a "super-single"). I actually bid for the super-single in the auction but couldn't get any :P . The super-single is a prototype the same size of the single that was never commercialised because of the incoming ASICs, generating 1.4GHashes. It went in the auction for 80-something bitcoins, and the minirig went for 1200 BTC or so IIRC, still much cheaper than street price. A normal single was given away in a raffle.
The minirig was mining there all the time, the numbers published are all legit and I fully believe Josh about the ASICs (likely even better than advertised).
The deal was pretty good for the FPGAs as well, since you can give them for the upgrade to ASIC and they will deduct the full price for it.

It does look a bit crazy from an orthodox point of view. I'll give you that.
However, inflation theory, like most economic theory, is built on assumptions on top of assumptions. Bit-coin is a real life, world-size experiment.
The main problem I see in bitcoin is that 90% of the monetary mass is for pure speculation and nobody really prices anything in BC, they convert to dollars, euros, pounds, yen or whatever they have where they live. People who hoard do so for speculation, not for savings. With current volatility it would be insane to save in bitcoins. This is the main problem: no real market.
As for deflation, we will see. In any case, we will have steady monetary growth for some 10 years more at least. This is more than enough time to learn a lot of lessons about scalability in P2P crypto-currencies.

Not trying to instil paranoia into you, but that still isn't enough in some situations. It's easy to generate an address with the same first and last bunch of characters in common with another with another address. So you really need to check more than that if there may be previous knowledge of the address by the counterpart.
If I need to compare two addresses I check visually and then I check in a browser using javascript (typing in the URL something like javascript:alert("1DMLq4UF1yWn9kTC8a6fvVcMzLizuShaz  " == "1DMLq4UFlyWn9kTC8a6fvVcMzLizuShaz  "); // which is false by the way ;) )

You'd listen to technical analysis and rarely they would give the same probability to each line. They talk of "main trends" and "secondary trends" and so on. So this 4-to-1 really carries no weight.
What I would challenge is that they provide any extra information than just looking at the graph with enough scope and making a guess.

Indeed, let's not be stupid. We can only speculate with the real evidence we have.
This happening in coordination points in the direction of a common attack vector, and the question is how did it actually happen and what led to it.

It can be pushed in today's circle quite a lot IMO. It will be interesting to see how that goes. More effort will go into social engineering people into accepting the outlawing of more and more technology, that P2P is evil, that anonymity is evil, etc etc. Some battles have been lost already in this respect, like the laws passed in some countries to force ISPs to keep logs, I reckon some protocols have been banned too.

Using bitcoins as a product instead of a currency works against its stability.
Do you have any savings or do you burn your money immediately not to *hoard* it?

It's funny how non-perfect anonymity is a deal breaker for financial firms, yet he later goes on to admit it's actually better than the alternatives.
It's also trivial to add a layer on top just by exchanging in different places to currencies or goods, outside of the network. There are trivial mechanisms even inside of the network. The point is: you can make it unfeasibly hard, to the point of impossibility, to be tracked. You just need to care and work it out a little bit. People who need it will likely do something. I can think of many ways without even trying too hard.
Most of these analyses work in measuring the behaviour of the whole system, but fail miserably at tracking a single user. Provided he doesn't broadcast his public key in his blog and then proceeds to transfer just between his own accounts or those of close people.

It is. In the real world, which is the one that matters mostly. Nobody (nobody sane at least) thinks right now of bitcoins as an isolated value, without making some sort of conversion. It's nowhere stable enough to do that and any stability it has, depends massively on hubs like MtGox, TradeHill or Intersango and whatever happens there.
Namely, if there services didn't exist or were unreliable enough, transactions would mostly be academical. This, in common human terms, translates perfectly to **"relying on it."** It's not technical reliance, it's practical reliance.
Maybe one day this is not the case.


Again, you are confusing pipe dreams and reality.
De facto Bitcoin maintains a minimum value, which is the main factor behind people taking them.


For example, total decentralisation of mining among all participants (this is advertised in many places, and it's not even close to be true). Or monetary supply being hard-coded in the protocol.
Both affirmations are strictly false.

Amortisation of FPGAs is much higher at this point, so they don't make up for the difference in electricity consumption. It would take many years to pay up the difference, and I'd expect graphics cards from 2-3 years in the future to be much more efficient (22nm and all).

I can believe all that because, technically, the site was really really basic.
Anyone with decent command of a web framework like Ruby on Rails or Django, for instance, can design and develop that in a matter of days (leaving room for the "design" part - if it was surefire coding, it's a matter of hours really). 
The infrastructure, replication and security hardening work was simply not done or done to a very low standard.
Zhou Tong is special in that he's a kid that does margin trading and does it well (verified fact). He's familiar with the tools from the user point of view. He's also industrious and has quite the personality for a kid, you just need to see how he plays the "press" game and social engineers the fuck of a lot of people in bitcointalk. It's hilarious.
The intersection between:
a) young age (18 currently IIRC, 17 at the time)
b) knowledge about margin trading
c) familiarity with web development
d) being brazen enough to open such a service. Knowing the risks, the allure to the worst of the worst in the internet, and still going ahead.
Honestly, I think a lot of people can top that, just don't dare to. Kids ALWAYS underestimate/ignore risk, it's basic psychology and human nature. Most of the people able to do that, and more, would simply be either scared to do it or feel overwhelmed by the sense of responsibility.
Expect copycats to be also crowded with relatively young kids or sociopaths. Much more likely than actually doing all that really needs to be done behind the scenes to reasonably run such an operation.
PS: he did come out of this on top! which is frankly mind-blowing, like many other bitcoin social phenomena. Somebody else is paying for this and he surely made a very decent bounty for the work involved.
I say... well done and sucks for those who went ahead and risked big sums to an operation that offered no real guarantees. Anyway, it looks likely that they will get their funds back with time. So... that was lucky actually, all things considered.
It actually made a lot of sense that a young kid did it. It was a bit like a perfect storm of factors :-D which you cannot say it ended badly for him.

I wasn't actually really accurate here. The problem is more "application-layer" than "OS-layer" - but it's remedied in some windows managers by giving visual feedback about the "copy" operation having happened (xmonad, Awesome, enlightenment and some others) - none of the major operating systems does this by default, and sometimes an app or process stealing the focus can lead to a failed copy.
For instance, all modern browsers can steal the focus away from a text area or a tab after a javascript event happening in the same or other tab (infuriates me) or window (like some extremely annoying pop-unders do). Also, you can simply lose focus by accidentally clicking outside or pressing [tab] and under some html code (like divs with y-overflow) the text will remain visually selected despite the focus being lost and the copy not working. Then you can be pasting the previous copy.
I've also had "copy/paste" accidents in other applications but often I haven't been able to replicate the problem and I'm not sure why it happened. However I've learnt my lesson and now I check stuff twice before immediately sending "pastes" in chats!!! some really compromising shit you can do... and when at all possible instead of copying I cut (you can always paste twice). 
Sorry for the long rant.

I do condone money laundering.
If you live in one of these sharia regimes where buying music is illegal, hiding the tracks of this economic activity is money laundering. 
In some places, getting anti-inflammatory drugs is illegal if you dare circumvent the government rackets.
In some places, getting completely harmless recreational articles is illegal.
In some places, porn is illegal.
Therefore I strongly oppose to this concept of making ALL economic activity traceable to ALL "official" governments or agencies, and this is an all or nothing issue, since once you regulate it you give someone control over it, and basically against everyone who dares disagree with this person or organisation.
I vote for making do without this follow-the-money kind of prosecution. Follow the goods instead. This is similar to a "cash should be outlawed" argument: cash or no cash, I definitely side with cash, even if it can be used for virtually untraceable transactions. The alternative is having your pic and passport number plastered in all your transactions.
I actually have to get going with these transaction obfuscation services, just in case they outlaw something absurd where I live in the future and then I need a past record of doing it just for shits and giggles. Use them so using them doesn't look obviously suspicious.

Interesting point of view. I think the complete opposite.
If android market/amazon/ebay adopt it before enough people understand and accept bitcoin, it will likely be outlawed. Bitcoin means anonymity and no taxes among many other things. Governments will come at it with their standard "money laundering, black money, terrorism funding, illegal arms trade, drug trafficking" and maybe even throw paedophilia at it. They don't like cash either but at least they can control that.

If people buy coffees and pay for them directly and individually on the blockchain, the system will collapse. Our current system simply doesn't scale that far.

Yeah, as I clarified it's the total amount transferred that makes little sense. Usually you want to consolidate several txs when they are so small, and then the space they take in the blockchain is more justified. This can be done even without LN, simply aggregating a few txs.

If they mean what you say, then:
- they are not answering what they are being asked
- they are doing a terrible job at explaining themselves, because they are implying a behaviour that is different to what you say (higher PoW without validation rules vs choice of node)
This is pretty specifically different to what you are saying. And it does open questions over stuff I don't know - which I haven't talked about either, despite of your insistence to the contrary. Like, for instance, if they ship a list of default nodes of their choice. Generally I'm not interested about these things because I don't use SPV, but the network effects of a software defaulting to concrete nodes and running SPV can be important in the event of a HF.

Who knows. If the blocksize and node requirements keep growing in a similar pattern as in the last few years, nodes will require increasingly exclusive hardware and connections.
Watches don't generally have access to unmetered connections. That would be very challenging itself to make it practical. RAM and battery life would also be massive challenges, because validating ~1MB blocks can already be pretty expensive computationally for a watch.

Roughly, but not strictly. I mean, what you say is exactly how the market logic works in the West traditionally.
- Credit and liquid cash in Japan fluctuate massively against each other. Buying abroad is partly insurance/hedging. This is reinforced by the other point.
- Corporate decisions about spending are made by the board in quite an expedient fashion over there. Generally they look for growth and long-term insurance above yield. Most Japanese and Korean companies are run by a very small core rather than votes or anything like that. Families, often.
And that's why Asian corporations are shopping abroad, and shopping big. They also invest heavily in things like RE.

Hi Kris.
I'm not going to doubt of your good intentions. However, let me compare what you offer to real-life mining investment (be it options, derivatives, futures or any other package) so you can see how lousy it is in comparison.
You are taking the "real life" alternatives and stripping them of contracts and legal obligations on your part, taking solely your word as warranty. You are offering an equivalent to mining (which would stand in court as proper mining and thus lacks protection and regulation from this sector) over a "metal" that has much, much higher volatility than any real life ore. You also cannot account for ownership/rights over said ore, you are just leasing "mining machinery" and promising a "best effort" attempt to mine in an open mine competing to whoever cares to show up. I guess you see the implications of this: if said high-volatility ore actually went up sharply, it's trivial to assume that investors would flock to the mine endangering your profits even is this situation. And the potential profits you offer are more or less in the same league as some sovereign bonds, or corporate bonds be it mining or not. An investor has to care about the viability of your business.
The closest real-life examples are HYIP schemes, which are 99% of the time scams, for obvious reasons. Still, this market is ripe with kids and amateurs and I bet you get a lot of people interested. I'm actually willing to guess you have this very same background and you are honestly trying to do right and you will hold on to your word and pay back even if you lose big on your operation 1-2 years from now.
Given your position the most doable, orthodox scheme would be for **you** to actually pay up front lower profits than the equivalent alternatives (as in, here, getting this card) in exchange for you taking the risk of difficulty/valuation ratio going up during the next 1 or 2 years. You would then get the profit difference if prices went up and your money and then some back (insurance) if profits went down. Similar to options.
Notice that in any of these schemes including yours, being there no contracts, the logical thing would be to use a trusted third party escrow.
When you make a comparison of ROI with getting this card (best card for mining bar none in terms of ROI) and your ROI is much better, not only your offer looks more profitable, it also looks more unsafe. It's like Greece offering massive ROI on their bond or a HYIP promising 10% a month returns. In the best case it makes you think "wow, will they really make it?" and in the worst case, it makes you think "Ponzi."
It's going to be a really, really interesting year nonetheless!

To fully validate you still need to store the entire chain and receive it in real time.

Correction: Luke is right. Should have said "the UTXO set" - not necessarily the entire blockchain. BUT, I wouldn't call it "full node" if you cannot serve the full chain, but "verifying node" - probably worth establishing a best practices glossary for vocabulary.

Fully agreed and it makes all the sense. It's not an attack when miners stop adding under-cost transactions. At best, it's a violation of some social contract that used to exist early on (aiding adoption via facilitating super-cheap test txs) but that we knew it wouldn't be sustainable forever.


You do realise that this introduces funky dynamics, right? Esp. if you can use this extra speed to gain a competitive advantage and effectively withhold blocks for a while selectively to other miners.

Electrum - possibly the most popular SPV wallet - detects forks and lets the user choose chains right from the GUI.
I recommend the presentation from yesterday: 
See 
There's nothing about SPV wallets mandating any concrete form of verification. Quite rightly, rules based on the contents of the blocks cannot be thoroughly verified without a node - but things CAN be done even without a node.
OpenBazaar should at the very least allow the user to know a chain split happened, esp. when a fork without replay protection is supposed to happen in November.

It's pretty simple, the scalability trade-offs don't go away. You'll find that these problems are only problems at scale. The name gives it away. What you personally do does not matter. What a % of the world population could do, does matter.


User adoption won't grow at your expected rate necessarily and it's unpredictable. Only predictable thing is the barriers you put to avoid a system collapse. In this case, the most basic and obvious one is the block size cap. Not the only one, obviously, as we're seeing in this post. Miners can decide to take other measures on their own and they're few enough that they can coordinate them easily.
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:20:22
No. I'm answering the question he asked.
There is no problem with sending to SegWit addr from legacy, no matter whether your exchange supports it or not. And the reason is that the only way this could affect you is that you wanted to reuse the address, which you shouldn't anyway.

It's not a very clear case of TotC. It's more of a case of misaligned incentives. The relationship of a Bitcoin bank with a system that ultimately strives to remove them is one that tends to degenerate. Given disproportionate power, I have zero doubts that they'd kill Bitcoin as a censorship-resistant system. Simply because it's nothing but a short term limit to their business model, despite being the characteristic that makes Bitcoin make any sense at all. But if you look closely, the system doesn't need to make sense (see Ethereum). Smoke and mirrors can provide copious profits for a long time, before people inevitably realise there is no point. But this can take long enough that it makes no sense to worry about that, business-wise.
I mean, they don't even have to agree with these diagnostics. It's easy not to be objective about realities that are inconvenient to you. Kodak didn't want to believe digital cameras would be overwhelmingly dominant over a few years rather than many decades.

The question is "Does this mean that OpenBazaar will part with bitcoin in the upcoming hard fork?" and they can choose to defect to what SPV does. That means something concrete and it's a choice.

Realistically, the question now would be if they are going to do something about potential chain hoping and loss of funds/replay attacks. It's perfectly possible, by running their node.

It's not a self-balancing market though. They have incentives that don't clearly align to those of Bitcoin and favour very specific visions for it. 
In the textbook case for "tragedy of the commons", the herd has a collective incentive to preserve the pastures, but an individual short-term incentive not to.
Bitcoin "banks" have a collective, long term incentive to keep Bitcoin censorship free and non regulable at the base level, but an individual short-term incentive to collaborate with authorities striving for the opposite. Given enough power, they will self-destruct (and possibly pivot to something else, so not necessarily a self-destruction but an extinction of this particular business model which may perfectly be profitable for them).

I'm sure his opinions would carry a lot of weight as far as opinions carry weight - which isn't further than code and science. Satoshi never engaged in political bickering about the protocol and I doubt he would now. Some of the most active Core developers share this characteristic. Satoshi introduced a block size limit, not for political but for practical reasons. Some people who claim to be "devout Satoshi followers" want to remove it in all practical senses (make it always so large it is not a practical limit).
Anyway, I'm off this discussion because it's done to death.
Certainly I wouldn't listen to Satoshi anymore than I listen to anybody who is knowledgeable in this space. I base my opinions of evidence and reason, not on authority.

This has zero relevance to the point I was trying to make.


A Bitcoin bank operating in the regulated market is absolutely no different from any other bank.
Bitstamp, Coinbase, etc are the opposite of Bitcoin, no matter how convenient do they make it for us to back BTC with fiat, and how they indeed have pushed the funding of Bitcoin development in doing so.


No, not really.


You misread the whole point of the example.
The example was just an example on how a business may want to interpret the technology in a way that it's most convenient for their short term profit rather than their long term survival.
The exchanges' best interests do not always align with those of bitcoiners. This is so self-evident it feels extremely boring to even have to elaborate. Even more so in the case of transmission services like BitPay.

Already fees pay for a substantial share of the miners' reward. With "hyperbitcoinisation" and a lot more economic use, fees could pay much more reward than the current total, with much lesser reward per tx.
Obviously there are massive technical hurdles to arrive there. Some of them show-stoppers  which will make hyperbitcoinisation fail if they are not sorted beforehand.

Negroponte seems particularly clueless on economic matters. I remember the brilliant idea of making the OLPC project such that people could not buy it unless in that scheme of "buy one give one" or whatever it was called. It made sure it was a rip-off and an unmitigated failure by most measures, despite all the donated effort and the good work put into it. He also thinks that holding BTC, which is what gives it a value base, is somehow screwing it.
Negroponte is the embodiment of this theory that so-called progressiveness is the secular version of Abrahamic religion morals.
There's a book where this is explained in detail:
"Multiculturalism and the Politics of Guilt: Toward a Secular Theocracy" by Paul Edward Gottfried.
The parallels between progressivism and Abrahamic religions (especially Christianity) I think they're undeniable.
Progressivism is country-less, Universalistic. Aims for expansion, even by imposition. It promotes guilt. Charity transforms into solidarity and becomes a virtue of the State. Egalitarianism switches from a moral virtue into a coercive force by the State, people are not equal in opportunity or consideration but shoehorned into equal output and differences are evil. Loves the weak and the dependant. NGOs adopt a missionary role. Media imposes these morals via propaganda as a form of Church and Bible. Its staunch believers are [Millenarianists]( they think the infidels of progressivism need converting and educating for the Ultimate good.

Privately yes, comply with KYC within the legal framework and respecting privacy law yes, sharing it with other people and private businesses without a case no. That's neither moral nor legal, but surely it does happen sometimes in Bitcoin land.
For instance Karpeles could claim a robbery and ask Bitstamp for info about the owner of an account, without an order. Now if you are in charge in Bitstamp what do you do? Without a compelling, jurisdictionally relevant order... you don't share user data. You don't even know for sure what happened or if said user did steal anything.

Yeah, that's interesting but it's a different problem (I had thought of something like that, establish a global pooling mechanism to divide the work - note that this also improves the variance as several poisson processes have a lot less variance than just one).
But in that system all the propagation has to be made to miners and all miners work at full steam. There is no sharded division of the work at that level as in the case of RSCoin where ALL work can be divided in strict shard partitions without any coordination problems.

Currently a node will take about 150GB-200GB of monthly bandwidth. This can be pretty significant for a home connection. Other than that, right now, it's not a major expense to run a node but it might be if average block sizes multiply in size next year.

Yes, that's right. It pushes the limit to throughput and the ability of the miners to keep up, or else be unable to verify blocks for a while after others.
Basically it makes sustained network capacity the factor and latency a lesser factor. It probably allows on its own around a 10x block jump bandwidth-wise (but there's still storage, verification, and ability to join the network all drastically getting worse). Maybe makes 4MB or so blocks not a big drama short term. When it happens, which is not yet.
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:08:38

What's your favourite model for zero-confirmation txs?
I don't think there's a solid model for avoiding double spends in zero-confs so I'd much rather allow for resubmission which has clear positive usages, rather than trying a half-arsed model of pseudo-secure zero-conf transactions.
But I'd like to dig deeper in the options available to cancel txs in the current model without changing the tx format.

I know they do this, I'm unclear on how do they actually manage coins internally.
In any case, the existence of services that may sign on your behalf kind of craps all over the concept of signing as proof of ownership.
This is a pet peeve of Luke-Jr, you can ask him or just check the last couple of days in the dev list.
The only sure-fire way to prove you control coins, is to move them to an address you declared beforehand. Otherwise it can be gamed, which invalidates it as a voting system.

It's not effective. The subsidisation is currently so high compared to fees it's pretty obvious that it's not a big consideration. You can also see that in the high variance that exists for tx inclusion between miners, and their criteria.

That measures exactly the hashing power as controlled by either the pools or the users when the pool allows (like in P2P pools, where they have their preferences too).
So that basically measures the support from the people who would implement it. The people who can simply remain mining small blocks whatever any dev says if push comes to shove.
Basically, the support that matters most for mining. And the blocksize is explicitly a mining matter. They put the txs. They choose which ones, and they ultimately can overrule any cap size downwards any time.

I think the term bubble is wrongly used often. What made it a bubble wasn't that it was unsustainable or looked too high for some people's subjective PoV. What made it a speculative bubble was the fact that people only bought with the intention of reselling at a higher price. I think there's little doubt of that, a lot of the traffic at the time was non-users with rushed exchange accounts trying to make a buck. We know as much from MtGox's investigation.
That is why there's no such thing as a bear bubble, but sure you can figuratively say that to mean it's artificially low, but always keeping in mind that this is not what a bubble really is. You can say it's oversold in more conventional speculation terms.

Again, you don't understand the difference.

I pointed out already a few posts above this that the "bigger blocks" camp is likely to be much bigger, although still maybe overstated by the blatant artificial noise in the sub.
XT? you have ways to mine XT now even without Slush, on at least one of the P2P pools. It's probably around 1% tops, likely around the actual results they are getting. Within Slush, at the moment they were doing all the BIP101 voting, it never got above 12%, and that's with basically all the vote concentrated on a pool that's not one of the biggest.
So yeah, although I did expect a bit more success for the XT camp, honestly it seems to be pretty minor and concentrated in niche demographics. Even the staunchest of the believers must be realising this by now.

That is another thing, the same argument is technical or political depending on the faction. This environment is completely untenable, I think a clean split is for the best, and let them try to take over in a hostile manner like they are already doing but without the double moral standard.

It's many things, including the particular blockchain we are on now. XT could have its own chain.
It just so happens that 99.5% of the declared majority (100% of the real majority) runs on Core. 
So far this is reality, but if you don't like it you can live on denial and fantasy.
The overtake mechanism is bogus as it gets, and can be countered by Core if it ever got to be a real problem.
I'd expect XT to be completely cut off Core sometime in the next 6 months. They can also play the fork game and they have the upper hand.

It's refreshing that you ask instead of stubbornly reject that a discussion even exists, which is the most common trend these days.
I will outline just the main three.
- "impedance" as outlined in his paper is a force towards pooling together that grows with block size. All things equal, any significant degree of impedance means that the miners immediately profit from pooling together either openly or via secret pacts.
- miners don't have the same supply-demand curve, it varies strongly from miner to miner as does hashing power and connectivity. New market dynamics on location and connectivity become significant and can skew the model into being useless to express the real situation.
- known limitations exist that make the market "break" towards both ends. There are several attacks based on blocksize that would decrease demand on increased supply, which is enough counter-proof that the market is only workable within a range. Mempool attacks on nodes and miners, selfish mining attacks, propagation attacks, etc. Therefore the synthetic model demonstrably fails on extreme ranges, and this can be reproduced in testing.
The two last ones combine into making the supply-demand model valid only within a limited range of other variables.
@_date: 2015-09-04 10:30:29
Something that has essentially never happened even in the 4-5 years that Bitcoin is popular. Also, this would be a crisis just because some people say so, as if having people wait for scalability measures to bring fees down will mean they go in anger and never come back.

If the amount is small enough I don't think a hardware wallet is justifiable. Mycelium in the phone will do just fine. Most people have a smartphone these days, some are cheaper than those wallets.

On a related note, Bitcoin can never compete on throughput with a crypto that can run on trusted collaborating datacentres. That's just not possible, Bitcoin has this massive feature that is generally not requiring trust between the different actors but it comes at a big hit in direct throughput.
A sidechain working like that internally could compete though.

We have a lot of that religious mentality around here. They ignore even the most staunch and stubborn of the realities. There is no logic in that a higher transactions per second ratio means higher price, and experience shows it's not the case. It's also obvious that not all transactions are the same.
It doesn't matter how clearly this is laid down in front of them, they simply ignore it. Therefore the desperation a lot of people show for increasing the block size cap at any costs.
There's a massive difference between demand for holding Bitcoin and demand for a higher number of transactions. Transactions themselves only require tokens, at any value. The rate can be just dynamically adjusted (there is no native Bitcoin economy, nobody sets prices in Bitcoin and ignores the exchange rate for a long period).
I suggest you ignore the gigablocker crowd in matters of monetarism because they are clueless beyond belief, despite there being some bright people.
If you want to learn about Bitcoin I recommend you enrol to [Coursera]( (still in time, no compromise). 
There's a lot of good stuff in the net, depending on the approach you want to take at it and your focus.

This is where I think you are wrong. The drama was just as fabricated as the blocksize crisis and by the same people.
Anything that isn't them taking over the sub will be met with vicious aggression, making moderation unavoidable. Theymos allowed 1 or 2 posts a day, to the extent that these weren't also taken over and brigaded you could see what was going on.


Discussion is allowed in many places, and happens in person between devs and enthusiasts, and consensus is not reached. Sometimes there are differences so deep that no consensus can be reached. Consensus is always relative. I can understand them just fine, because I'm also quite clear that I won't accept their premises and their focus. So things are progressing more or less as expected. From outside one can naively think that everybody can love each other etc, but conflict sometimes happens.
Don't assume that these people will arrive to the same conclusions as you. Trust me, they have been told everything and more, time and again. They just don't see things the same way.

Adam Back: [...] it's much easier to apply policy to people who are running, you know, datacentres [...] regulators were talking about *Know Your Miner*. *Know Your Customer*, *Know Your Miner*. And it's kind of a worrying trend, right? Because basically the way that regulators look at the world is to identify the hierarchy. Like, who's in charge. And who/where are the influence points, and if you over time kind of re-architect the network towards a factory model with a hierarchical centre... that presents risks. So I see it that currently, you know, as Mark Friedenbach had said the network is already in fragile zone in decentralisation.
Gavin Andresen interrupts: **I disagree with that. I think it's plenty decentralised, probably over-decentralised for resistance to regulatory pressure.** 
Finally Gavin comes clear about that point. Spelt it out right there.
Okay, so if he thinks that the networks is over-decentralised for resistance to regulatory pressure then we just have a radically opposed vision of what Bitcoin is. There is no possible discussion, compromise or agreement about this.

If you don't rebuy the BTC you spend and vendors convert to fiat, yeah it sure is. Using Bitcoin as merely a payment channel does not establish a value base, holding does. Keeping BTC in the BTC economy does. But as a payment channel it can have advantages like anonymity/pseudonimity. When it doesn't I think it's rather pointless to use.

That's the thing, they disagree with you. They don't believe that a huge block Bitcoin will represent a better deal.

To be fair, lately people are being allowed to troll a lot about XT. So that really subsided somewhat.
For a while its been a sub about Bitcoin sans XT, strongly moderated on topics related to gigablockism and XT. I guess that kind of sucked if you wanted to blast all day about it instead of staying in the designed thread, but thanks to it we had some variety in the FP. There's the XT sub and a bunch of other subs that have appeared, I don't see what's wrong with using them. This is not a public service.

It's long term predictions at this point. 400KB under normal circumstances and maybe on track to hitting a constrained fee market in probably 1 year or 2 (except for surreal scenarios where the halving triggers some sort of new global awareness). And even then it wouldn't be such an emergency.
I think the bigger picture of a more fee-aware relationship between users, services, and miners is necessary and supersedes the maximum block size issue. Adoption cannot go ahead of technology or it will simply crush the system.
That said, if the debate was saner it wouldn't matter as much to lift block sizes maybe temporarily while other models are in the works (except right now we'd be getting a lot of spam in the blockchain at a faster rate). Fees won't go down as an effect of lifting the block size these days, actually the opposite might happen if miners stop bothering to try to keep block sizes sane and stable.
I'm sorry to say this bluntly but it's crystal clear to me that the small block Armageddon tale is just populist politics to further some people's agenda. It's being divisive and incredibly distracting.

Then maybe consultancy or a local service.
For instance selling and explaining Keepkey devices: 
From the conference last week I thought one solution that seems workable from the get go and seems future-proof is Stroem.
Check it out, I think this guy is bang on the money in that the majority of the end users who will use Bitcoin *for smaller transactions* won't be able to deal with all the underlying technologies, much less if they compete (and they should).
The idea would be to establish a merchant in this field, and consultancy for *hodlers* with hardware wallets like Keepkey, maybe Ledger Wallet, Trezor (I have a Trezor since First Edition and I don't think it's recommendable for noobs). A combo of these two things, I think it's very very workable at a local level and expanding. I'm almost talking myself into doing it :-D

I agree with that, which is why miners who have a lot at stake in having a sustainable fee system and healthy transactions, together with good BTC valuation, are the ones to look for in terms of parameter setting. Especially when it's them who will put the blocks through and who will softfork down if they are overstretched.
When reward halves next year and with most transactions being massively under cost, miners can be taking a big hit. I think we need to be cautious about that.
@_date: 2015-09-16 16:19:27

@_date: 2015-09-14 07:50:33
Blockchain space is limited, if everybody tries to do their transactions directly on the blockchain the cost per transaction will quickly become prohibitive and only the most high margin transactions will get in in reasonable time.
Currently the blockchain allows for approx 4 transactions per second, which is tiny for a global platform. If you multiply this, say, 10 fold, you make it prohibitively expensive to run a node in most parts of the world, causing a concentration of nodes in businesses and a few nations. This is hazardous for Bitcoin's decentralisation and neutrality. And on top of that, it will still get you nowhere near the point that capacity is not a problem (40 tx/s is still tiny, 4000 tx/s is still tiny). So basically it's following a mythical beast into Nowhereland where Bitcoin is pointless and you lost the characteristics that you did have in pursuit of others that you couldn't possibly get that way.
That's why there's a lot of focus in scaling Bitcoin by means of offloading transactions from the blockchain. You'll hear a lot about smart contracts, sidechains, payment channels, Lightning Network, treechains, etc. These are decentralised solutions, because centralised solutions for trading Bitcoin off-chain exist since long ago and for the majority of Bitcoin's history they account for most traffic (exchanges, trading platforms, wallets with internal trading capabilities).
From another comment:




I quote from an [earlier comment]( in a different thread.






A lot of people hate being told and try to silence these self-evident facts.
Adoption absolutely doesn't need to drive price up. Only adoption of Bitcoin as a means of store of value does, not as a payment channel. What's more, Bitcoin's main blockchain as a micropayment channel is resource-depleting and damaging for the system.
Above convenience, which is also important, are:
- anonymity/pseudonimity
- neutrality from governments and financial corporations
- decentralisation as a means of guaranteeing and defending the above

Having worked on DHTs before these ideas are not new to me, there are several DHTs that do something very similar to that, including Kademlia of Bittorrent amd edonkey fame.
The thing is that sharding in Bitcoin won't work as well. Sharding can be applied so nodes propagate fractions of the transaction space, but once bloom filters or a similar technique is applied that won't be the problem, but the blocks themselves and these need to be propagated to each node for them to have the information they need.
Miners need all the transactions for PoW to work as intended (I can't see any way of dividing the miner space that would make sense, it's contradictory to PoW to have much less hashing power than possible).
As for storing only shards of the blockchain, that would require trusted nodes. Also a big no-no in Bitcoin.
So I don't think we can use much of it to be honest. If tx propagation even after the big optimisations that are coming continued to be significant vs block propagation, then maybe we could consider sharding the tx space for propagation in non-mining nodes (no requirement to make the distinction, could just let miners run nodes for every shard).

Well, I can see the logic that "technological advance will happen" is definitely not the same as "8GB won't be a problem". Many other things are implied there.
The most basic logic that I see broken there is that you don't plan 10, 20 years in advance without a very clear vision of what's going to be needed. Then, there's the fact that technology doesn't necessarily advance in the way we expect it to. Then, the fact that point-to-point downloads are a radically different thing to worldwide big P2P networks that require not just fast point-to-point downloads and uploads, but are also limited by the slowest connections and we want a diverse network for censorship-free, neutral currency (and also, flow through a densely connected network absolutely doesn't scale linearly with connection speeds much less if they are heterogeneous).
Then there's also the implication that, even if huge blocks were possible, that it will be a good idea to allow them to grow that much when we don't know if it would be more beneficial to have block size controlled by some sort of fee-dependent mechanism. I think, to the contrary, that it's very narrow-minded to look for exactly the same kind of "optimisation" 20 years down the line having no possible way to know if that's what will be needed or whether it will necessarily be beneficial in terms of trade-offs. This is like assuming that speed limits had to be risen every few years past the first few decades because "technology is amazing, cars will be faster and safer forever" and we set up a fixed plan in the 1920s to double it every few years.
Shorter terms, I think it's also pointless to raise it 8-fold without any tests and having non-negligible orphan rates as is, and a growing gap between soft limits set by miners and the full size of the average block causing uncertainty in the number of blocks it takes to include certain txs.

Blocksize is irrelevant to stop this from happening on its own.

Demand for usage is not the same as demand for holding, which is the only thing that pushes price up.
Bitcoin as a mere payment channel gives no incentives to hold. To the contrary, you want to get in and out as soon as possible to avoid volatility.
What gives Bitcoin an edge is pseudonimity, neutrality from governments and financial institutions and regulations. These characteristics are not guaranteed forever, they depend on the decisions that will happen in the near future. Bitcoin can work as a micropayments channel without this. In fact, it will work best as a micropayment channel without this. But then again, IMO that kind of future Bitcoin would be pointless.

I'm saying that I'm not going in the same conversation again when it's not relevant to the point I made in this thread.
Measures exist and they are known. I'm looking at several right now in the Bitcoin Scalability conference in Montreal.

You said users don't care about privacy, literally and it's there in writing.
That signed to me I need to review it myself before I use my Trezor and frankly I haven't got around to it.
By the way we're talking here about linking different addresses to the same user, don't mix up unrelated stuff like factory tracing which I'd also expect. The fact that you don't consider address linkability a deal breaker makes me question your judgment simply because I disagree.
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:57:27
Of course they can. With current fees it would be cheap to do so. They were using over 4 times the average fee last time, with half that they could still cause a backlog in the weeks with 8MB blocks.

Another concern is that many "owners" have their BTC deposited in wallet services that effectively own them for PoS purposes (they have the keypairs).
Wallet and pay services suddenly have massive voting power and a vested interest in a particular centralisation/decentralisation trade-off model.
Starting now to consider PoS is like changing rules in the middle of a game. Suddenly keypair ownership is a currency in itself, as is address-amount age. Plus mining is not PoS, thus a different sector pushing work to miners that might just completely ignore the scheme and start colluding to take control of the rules, something we don't want to happen.
@_date: 2015-09-10 08:55:06
There's this misguided notion that having Bitcoin work as a micropayments channel will somehow drive the price up. Putting an arse penny in and then out of the system does nothing for Bitcoin other than wasting resources, unless this brought a new "hodler" in, which won't be the case if he's merely using some start-up doing everything transparently in the background. As a means of promotion of the protocol and its direct usage if you will ("be your own bank"), but that basically stopped happening long ago, and instead it's now discouraged.
Also, adoption is not measurable in transactions any more than it's measurable in valuation for instance. There are people introducing transactions for reasons as various as raffles, games, messages, market indicators, "stress tests", etc which absolutely don't represent user numbers and bloat the chain significantly. Most importantly, current users doing microtransactions many more times rather than sensible transactions also appear to be "more users" if you consider this a valid metric on its own.
What drives price up is demand for the coins themselves not usage of the blockchain "for anything". Also note that not all scenarios that Bitcoin is useful and super-popular drive the price up.
A lot of people hate being told and try to silence these self-evident facts.

You cannot build a complete economic system upon a person or two. If something happens to them then you are fucked.
There is no problem with different implementations. In fact, there are several now, and BitcoinXT is not really one of them since it's based 99% on the same code. The problem is when different implementations (or forks with a few changes pushing vested interests) introduce real differences in the protocol with security repercussions, and even with possible fork-of-the-blockchain repercussions.

But we know that, of course it's a massive problem. But people won't just accept that $0.50 transactions don't belong in *this* blockchain, and will get furious to even be told that.
With current fees, it's cheap to fill even 16MB blocks for whole days. That is not acceptable. A bunch of nobodies with around £30K of spare change could have done a lot more damage that they've done. Someone some day will realise this can be exploited in the prediction markets or just shorting and then you'll have your incentive to keep on bombing the blockchain with spam until the cows come home.

Except when it doesn't. Certainly network flow in a P2P network doesn't scale exponentially.
If you make up something to be exponential (block size, or in this case max block size) then surely it shows linear on a log scale. That doesn't invalidate a linear scale.

@_date: 2015-09-16 15:54:59


Is that so? because we've had backlog for a while with the "stress tests" and AFAICS no terrible catastrophe has happened, and maybe a bit of a fee market has occurred.
Maybe you don't hear that any more because people are tired of repeating it? This argument sounds a lot more reasonable to me than BIP 101.
I think the progress about this is that people are more tired than ever, increasingly refuse to even debate. I can understand that because I'm strongly put off by every post about the same thing. Absolutely don't think there's any impending debacle because of the 1MB limit and I think the other solutions are... actual solutions, unlike putting the limit up. Interestingly arguments from people with *drastic block cap increase proposals* backed with data, often seem to prove how pointless that approach is. It's kind of strange.


I believe this is debatable too (I don't think this is real progress). But unrelated to the point. I was talking about the block size cap debate. It has probably regressed. For instance in the beginning I thought a hard fork was crazy talk. Now, provided we can agree to a method, I think it's the most desirable outcome. I really hope we can get rid of each other and both carry on separately, this is sort of like a horrible marriage.
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:42:07
I think it's possible to discuss forever with someone you cannot possibly agree with to anything, I just think all parties will eventually realise they are going nowhere.
By the way I'm not twisting anything. The quotations are verbatim and my opinion clearly separate from them.
@_date: 2015-09-19 00:41:23
Seems like you can, because this policy was enacted in 1972.
@_date: 2015-09-01 00:30:14
I looked into that since. Currently there is a message limit of 2MB (easy to lift on a planned fork) BIP 101 lifts it (still, 4GB will be another limit and it would need another modification down the line). BIP 100 would also lift the 2MB msg limitation.
This 2MB limit was introduced earlier this year.
See: 
Removing that will make it fall back to 32MB. In the BIP 101 fork, this is lifted as well to be the variable limit that grows, but I believe the hard limit of 4GB block size remains which would prevent the last doubling from working. Maybe I'm wrong about that but in any case that would be far in the future if it ever happens.
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:20:53
How so? you mean right now that we still have a massive backlog from a spam attack?

But you make this long-term suicide for the miner and the whole thing collapses. Mining has to be profitable, there is no two ways to that. Or else it will be done for other reasons, and this is finished.
@_date: 2015-09-09 09:30:38
The article is wrong on many accounts, not just that one. For starters it wasn't Andresen who released XT.
Also, the 0.8% (during a brief peak) support votes are for BIP 101, not XT. Although certainly XT is expected to be trojaned into the hard fork attempt if BIP 101 was ever to be activated.

Sharding the space of transactions could work, provided there are enough nodes and pools. It would immediately divide the bandwidth requirements for each node for transactions, but blocks would all still need to be propagated everywhere. Miners could just have a node in every shard to receive all the transactions.
Maybe using XOR-distance for the sharding like Kademlia (DHT) does for space assignment.

@_date: 2015-09-13 10:30:17
It will definitely alter the dynamics but I cannot see how can a given miner (suppose a low bandwidth one) keep up with gigabytes of transactions per minute.
When the block comes, in this scenario, he'd still be catching up with the transactions and unable to verify.
After a given threshold that even using the whole period is not enough to keep up with the blocks we'll still have a similar problem of worse connected miners opting for the blocks they could verify comprised of fewer transactions.
The simple market model is indeed dead because it becomes super-clear that different miners have different supply/demand curves and in this situation they are past the point that they can be reconciled somehow.
@_date: 2015-09-05 11:23:27

I'm sceptical about most of these initiatives as they all seek to raise money out of nowhere in some sort of ponzi scheme. I don't believe in "investment by being around", it boils down to viral marketing and pyramidal schemes. If you get people to funnel money though exchanges down to your tokens then it might work.

I run one from my home connection, which already makes a noticeable difference in its performance.
I have another one in a home connection from a family member, and the third one is in a dedicated server I have elsewhere.
I don't set any bandwidth limits to them. That hurts propagation. They are already very taxing as is. For all this super-incredible improvements in bandwidth, it has become harder not easier to keep up during the last 4 years. My connections have got more expensive and although 2 of them are a bit faster (~20% in 4 years) the bandwidth consumption has increased far more, from being negligible to severely straining my connection.

Well, that depends on what you call "criminals". Depending on which jurisdiction you are in, some trade is illegal. Selling alcohol in Saudi Arabia makes you a criminal. Selling pot in most of the US makes you a criminal as well. Both are legal in The Netherlands. These kind of trades did indeed give BTC a monetary base value early on at the very least.
The whole point about Bitcoin is in that kind of trade that governments or corporations may want to thwart or regulate. Otherwise there really isn't much point, as centralised solutions are very efficient.

I think you're going to need to be creative because this market is very competitive. Might as well use the edge BTC gives to anonymity-heavy services and broker things like DDoS protection, http proxies, PGP/GPG servers, streaming cams (BTC is getting big in girl cams heh), etc.
My advice as a first venue is trying to get in this list:

It would not be a very effective attack now precisely because of it. Spam attacks could be pretty bad too with much larger blocks. They're bad enough as is. In fact right now it would be useful to have a slightly smaller block cap.

Nope, that's like saying exchange addresses make Bitcoin more centralised because you are not seeing what happens in the exchange.

@_date: 2015-09-15 09:01:32
Yep well, nothing is going to be perfect.
That said, I think proof-of-burn or proof-or-spent-fee is better. Having tonnes of BTC is easy if you were around early on, but spending them is still tough and relates to current valuation.
There was a site looong ago that let you pay per vote to the site itself. People will hate on that idea, but it's probably better. Might count the donation to the site and the fee together, if you just want to pay satoshis to the site :D
Reddit is worse. People create a bunch of sockpuppets and brigade. You can see how as soon as some people appear the votes sway suddenly.

You can also buy big stake votes on issues they don't care about for a tiny amount. Best way within the schemes that favour coin-rich people is burn/fee-spend.
Honestly I wouldn't take seriously any result coming from such a PoOwnership scheme, and I doubt many would. So you are left with the decisions that people will opt-in to accept.

With LN for instance this is possible. You can make this possible in many ways, the key being that access to the blockchain is by its nature restricted and expensive, and to have all that hashing validating your pennies is simply not cost effective.
Space in the blockchain is currently being given extremely under cost and this is why you cannot scale it 100 fold for no cost, something's got to give. You may have to pay actual real costs if you do that, and they aren't cheap enough for the doritos-in-the-chain solutions.
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:16:47
I personally think BIP 101 is reckless and some sort of payment channel system (LN or whatever works best) is necessary for fees to be able to sustain transaction and miner investment.
BIP 101 simply sounds pointless to me. Rather than that why not lifting the limit completely? the idea is that the blocksize limit is always so much bigger than tx demand that it's not a factor. If that's the idea then the limit is pointless altogether, just remove it. Much simpler. I'd rather have something more sensible though, txs are ridiculously subsidised at the moment.
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:03:31
Yep well, but services like Coinbase or Bitstamp would own the site. Not exactly impartial.
@_date: 2015-09-02 09:07:16
Yes and no, currently average fees are low enough that many regular users will get caught in a long backlog, and some of them won't be able to even raise the fee to say 1% on cost (generally more than enough depending on the transaction) because their services don't let them pick a fee themselves.

That's the thing, RSCoin is not PoW.
Say you divide the blocks on some sharding mechanism so that only a subset of the txs go to each block. All miners will want to mine every block, so there is no division, you'd need a solid mechanism to keep it secret between shards or force them somehow to mine their assigned blocks with some punishing mechanism. That sounds impractical.
If you just make txs wait until they reach given blocks, that would just add waiting times randomly. 
PoW cannot work other way than maxed out to make sense. If your miner works more profitably at a fraction of the power something is wrong.
In the paper there are no miners, there is just on bank that simply generates the coinbase out of thin air on demand, and assembles the blockchain as it arrives.
The pointless bit about all this is that a simple distributed database is a much more efficient structure if you are in a trusted environment. I don't see why on earth do you want that, maybe to publish the blockchain and give a semblance of transparency when you really are doing whatever you want to do behind the scenes?

Bitcoin as a consumer payment system has strong niche usages, but makes no sense for large parts of what is currently targeted.
It won't sustain a whole ecosystem of payment channel megacorporations, there just isn't enough market for that within the realms that make sense. These are internet, privacy-centric payments which currently stay niche and will stay niche for the foreseeable future. The mainstream needs to do a lot of catching up in this regard.

The fees are not paid out of thin air, you have to spend them. A miner wins nothing at all by faking transactions (generally speaking). To the contrary, he increases his chances of having his block orphaned and lose the whole reward.
Also, the work miners are rewarded for is not including the transactions, it's hashing and it cannot be gamed. The inclusion of transactions is a right they have and only rewards them if the transaction pays fee, and this fee comes from the previous monetary base.

Next year the block reward will decrease by half. Currently block reward is so much higher than fees that this will make a big difference.


Apparently miners are not so sure about that.


Miners pay a cost for including transactions that is often not met by fees. LN will allow higher fees per KB which is exactly what miners want. Blocksize increase larger than fee increase makes miners operate at an even bigger loss and with reward subsidy going away it will just not happen. Miners don't need a maximum block size to stop them from including transactions, many are including fewer transactions than available simply because it's more profitable for them to do so. It's necessary to understand that to see why the maximum block size limit increasing drastically is more likely to hurt scalability than the other way around (bigger gap in miner behaviour, larger advantage including fewer transactions and bigger incentive to behaving selfishly).

I like his enthusiasm but I don't think these sort of bubbles help at all. Nor did it help in the slightest with the Internet business that so much investment was stupidly misplaced and dried out for years.
Some of the major internet companies today simply dodged the bubble by being only partially traded or not traded at all publicly.

Yeah, I can see there are valid justifications for that. It's a scheme I guess, and one that is much less pointless than message signing although it may not be obvious at first sight why these decisions happened in the first place.
I can see the pros and cons. However a voting scheme like this favours people like me who use their coins mostly for important transactions that don't happen often. This is not necessarily fair. Also, I'm a bit concerned about the de-anonymisation potential of this (including timing-attacks). Still much better than message signing in this regard as well.

Ohh I see. I was confused for a bit there.
So yeah, if there are services allowing you to sign with private keys of theirs then that destroys the "proof" mechanism.
Maybe a certain kind of transaction can be reasonable proof? Sending a small amount from the inputs you want to prove you own to the third party and all the change to a new address of your own. Any caveats about doing that?

In bitcoin.conf :
    minrelaytxfee=0.0003 
    limitfreerelay=1
These should be more than enough. I use:
    minrelaytxfee=0.001 
    limitfreerelay=0
Meaning I don't relay free tx at all, and I don't relay txs with fee under 0.001 BTC/KB
The parameter limitfreerelay measures 1000s of bytes per minute of free tx relays. You can set it to something like 8 if you want to still relay many free txs (default I believe is 15).
The average tx is around 350 bytes in size. Meaning that a minimum of 0.0003 BTC/KB requirement allows for a typical tx to go through comfortably with a fee of US$ 0.03 at current rates.
@_date: 2015-09-13 22:29:02
The next subsidy is going to have with some network strain for the first time. We can see certain effects on the fees that currently they are taking basically for sport and to keep the dream alive. This is just a few months down the line until they start feeling real strain, mining gaps appear, etc.
We need to start shifting to an economically feasible system and we need to start shifting very soon. Increasing the blocksize a lot and doing nothing else just delays this. It creates incentives towards irresponsible behaviour.

It's easy to criticise moderation but if the sub had continued being taken over by hordes of people who wouldn't shut up about their topic of choice silencing everything else, that also was a disaster.
When he was away the sub was completely unbearable.
Frankly I think it's much better that these threads are confined here to one or two a day (although the rule is constantly ignored) and their own subs. I think it's much better for everybody to be honest, although maybe it should not be necessary to ban people without warning.

They could just divide the original fee by 8 and it would have caused that havoc.
You see, he used approx 4.15 times the average fee. Stuff on half the average fee gets in just fine these days. An attack on 8MB blocks causing ~2 weeks backlog can be easily done for ~£20K. If you find a way to bet on the market you can easily make that back and some profit. These guys did find a motive in "viral advertising" (if not something else as well).
And that's not the whole deal. That's actually a very optimistic estimate of the backlog it would create. If you raise maximum blocksize to 8MB only some miners will fill them up, the others will accept them but most will fill much less (this already happens even with 1MB blocks, the gap between soft limits and max blocksize would be much bigger).
I'm not just trying to be a pain in the ass, this is the way it is. It's not great, but I think more people need to understand the situation to stop seeing a change in a parameter as a simple quick fix that some cunts are just opposing for no reason. It's not a quick fix for this, and there are good reasons to be careful about that (not detailed in this post but in many others). That rosy view of the system is dangerous. It's currently quite fragile and screwing with huge blocks can make it fragile in other places where it currently isn't.

If these people are mistakenly using Bitcoin for what it isn't ready to do, let them pivot. Or are you suggesting we scam them into believing it can possibly do what it cannot do, while at the same time losing the properties it does have?
You cannot wish reality away.
When Bitcoin is appropriate and ready for those usage then it will be. In any case, Bitcoin is not a product to sell. Bitcoin is a system and a network. We don't have to pitch it at this particular moment in time, maybe some particular companies do, for their usage. But Bitcoin itself doesn't.

In regards to point number one, I think you have to go through Peter's paper.
Propagation impedance is such that minimising it maximises profit. Peter's omission is that joining pools together reduces their impedance immediately to zero among them, giving them immediate benefit.
With regards to point 2, demand is uniform but their cost of supply and their propagation impedance varies.
Peter does say that it's only efficient in a range, but he doesn't say that rather than correcting itself towards equilibrium the market can choose to go outside of the range and there are incentives for it (see centralisation of miners for instance, also the existence of a significant subsidy for years to come and its lasting inertia).
I think it's fair that for a fee market to be more effective we need to introduce some changes first, and having a block size cap seems like a sensible safeguard in the meantime. For instance, in today's talks Bram Cohen proposed changes that would help in the transaction protocol (that would work immediately towards a fee market) and Miles from Princeton (can't remember his full name) also talked about the gap times in mining that will appear as soon as next halving if we don't have a consistent backlog of low-priority transactions, weakening mining security as a whole.
Honestly I think it's bonkers that one would go around this simply increasing the cap exponentially, I'm having a hard time believing this is not a malicious idea to be completely honest.

Supposedly when pruning is production ready, you will have something that is pretty much the same size as the UTXO set containing the minimum information required to validate blocks.
I don't know how much is this exactly right now (could check in my nodes I guess) but it can fluctuate a lot. There is no penalisation for creating UTXOs specifically, fee costs are very low, and they count the whole size of the transaction in the same way. Your transaction would be reducing the UTXO set size and require the same fee as a transaction doing the opposite thing.
Something I always thought needs revising.

Peter_R already did.
IMO he went downhill from there as if magically the demand for blocksize in the real world already far exceeded current capacity. He constantly contradicts his own points, it's bizarre. What we are seeing is politics, not the "market".
Interestingly his paper, which is very good despite the glaring omissions, makes it crystal clear that pushing that inherent fee market with limitless blocks is a surefire way to make miners to pool together down to 1 single pool.
I find him extremely interesting because he seems very genuine and intelligent, but keeps doing this for whatever reason. He also gets really worked up on politics, rants a lot in here and the XT sub and speaks in terms of "us vs them" relentlessly.

Inputs and outputs are exactly balances being transferred from one address to another. That is how the basic protocol works other than more complex scripts that are barely used. Not necessarily the whole balance of an account, but balances nonetheless. The metaphor is definitely not moving "coin" units of value. Coins don't divide and aggregate, coins move. People expect a *direct representation* of what a coin is and in the protocol there is none.

They might also further strengthen the evidence that most VC investment is either parasitic or toxic to the whole idea behind Bitcoin. A lot of people seem to either ignore that or maybe they're into some of such ventures and have lost objectivity to realise Bitcoin is strongly about cutting middle men and protect people from fiat banking world rather than bridging to it in creative ways.

Header-first sync means you can download blocks in parallel among other things, but not that the Bitcoin P2P is more efficient for downloads than Bittorrent (plus there's the extra strain you add to the network).
I'm pretty sure my computer can verify blocks much faster than it can download them, and my connection is fine. You need to take into account that this process is constrained by both my downstream and the upstream of the nodes I may connect to and the network between us. So definitely nothing that will just match some synthetic scenario and much more of a real-world-with-bottlenecks-and-warts scenario.
Also, if you have a large chunk of the blockchain that is completely pre-verified then complete re-verification of it should not be necessary. You'd verify a large 50GB file with secure hashes and that'd be it. In some alts they still do that.
The idea is that Core is now closer in performance to Bittorrent so no point in making people run both (as per Wuille's argument), but in any case that depends on the strain the Bitcoin network is under at the moment. Definitely under "stress test" conditions the download is noticeably slower, and you may be worsening propagation as well.
Re-indexing is another pain and I think it's been made much slower in newer versions for some regression. This can improve a lot with a more adequate file db system but there's plenty on the table so I don't think this is happening soon.

The only thing they need to do to achieve that is not including low fee transactions. Some miners already do that. But the majority don't. The reason is that with current block sizes most miners can afford the rare orphaned block for the little extra they get in fees.
By including fake transactions you worsen your orphan rates and get zero benefit in return.
That plan makes absolutely no sense and would achieve nothing. If the majority of miners didn't included pointlessly low transactions that would be the best way to achieve higher fees. 
They could do that at any time as some already do. But:
- as long as any significant pools don't join, this doesn't have much real effect. With the block bloating idea, the only real effect works against the miner
- there is undeniable pressure from the community to continue including super-cheap transactions as an adoption incentive
@_date: 2015-09-10 14:45:11

The reason why decibels are on a log scale is because audio sensors require an exponential increase in sound emission to register a linear increase in reception. Approximately anyway, because sensors are not so range perfect including our built-in ones. So a log scale makes more sense. It's a common pattern with things that expand in multiple dimensions like for instance vibration force in earthquakes. It also makes sense in investment because returns are proportional to the difference between buy/sell prices rather than absolute arbitrary units.
Why do you think the moneyness has to be in a log scale when the units are already ratios?

That depends on how it would impact your chances of getting your block orphaned, which increase for each tx and especially if your connectivity to other miners isn't great. Currently it really doesn't pay to add low fee txs for most miners, they do it at a loss.
Give this a good read, it's possibly the most accurate model I've seen around:
What it doesn't capture is the heterogeneous utility curves between miners, and how could one go around creating pre-agreements among them. I have a few prototypes with varying level of complication, the problem is that they're on the complex side compared to popular BIPs on this subject, so very unlikely to gain any traction in this reigning reddit ochlocracy.
@_date: 2015-09-15 09:16:11
Then probably you can see this through, depends on your outlook.
The following is merely speculative:
My prediction is that we will still drop down for a while. Too much uncertainty. We will have to reassess by the time the halving comes near, but I don't think it's nailed that the price will go up, there are many factors at play and some challenges to mining that will have to be resolved by that time. There will be pre-emptive swings but purely expectation-based. Currently: I think the bumpy ride downwards will continue. Will re-evaluate in a month or two.

For some minutes of main chain outage? Even if you can still operate outside of it? 




With a few billion US$ you can easily purchase mining power to mine ~60% of the blocks.
This is partly because mining profitability is a bit shit and very insecure long term, because fees are stupidly cheap (related to the other point).
In both cases the attacks are limited and temporary.
This is the reality, you can't just wish it away. If you bump blocks 8 fold now, you have essentially the same reality but you have taken domestic nodes out completely, making the network significantly more vulnerable in other places where it currently isn't.




That argument just doesn't make sense. You cannot ignore reality, there are problems to fix that won't fix themselves and the only feasible solutions consist in unloading the main blockchain from transactions that cost $8+ to include but pay cents, while the next reward halving looms and makes this even more unsustainable (it already is, you only need to wait until someone finds a motivation to spam the network as just happened, because it's so cheap).
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:31:50
I have to agree with you there.
BitcoinXT managed something I deemed impossible: out-circlejerk the existing Bitcoin communities.
I just disagree with you about the moderation. The moderation here is much, much better than the user-moderation through vote suppression and it's effectively a counter-balance to it.
This community is pretty toxic and the mods have a really hard job in their hands. A lot of the circlejerk is powered by greed, which is a strong motivator. Many proponents from both sides think they will lose a lot of potential monetary gains if they lose the argument. This motivation has been around all the time in the community ever since the bubble I'm afraid, this is not just crypto geeks with a strong belief in privacy, anonymity, freedom as it was originally.

And you cannot see that this is a dangerous development to simply allow to happen? In the extreme it will destroy the fee market itself.
That model does not account for us stopping centralisation as we should, or else Bitcoin is vulnerable. Partly because of that we cannot allow blocks to grow indefinitely without regard for centralisation concerns.
@_date: 2015-09-08 13:42:43
That partly depends on how it happens.
If 2MB blocks happen by just increasing the maximum block size and the transactions are similar to the ones we have today, then:
- No fee market, miner Centralisation
Miners run on a temporary subsidy. There's pressure towards centralisation, loss of miner competitiveness in the future (cheaper to assemble a 51% farm).
Effect on orphan rates and propagation times unclear but at 2MB likely not major.
- Bandwidth and storage limitations
It becomes increasingly harder to run nodes and mining pools. We see a severe reduction in numbers, and a strong bias to countries with high availability of cheap broadband. Node-level security is reduced (non-consensus rules most affected in this level)

That's cool I guess. I fail to see why this means that "if you think the block size debate matters, you're probably not a bitcoin user". Maybe you are unable to care about more than one thing at the same time?


Probably. The fact that I care about Bitcoin and its workings, covers all possible use cases it may have where it makes sense.
Precisely the reason why many of us care about bitcoin staying decentralised and neutral is that people can use it even when some oppressive laws or corporations decide they don't like a certain kind of transaction.

I have nothing to do with blockstream and I cannot see how are these in contradiction.
More raw txs by means of ramping up the maximum block size without any other measures will get you all of that as a trade-off.
I run 3 nodes, if average block sizes multiply in the next few months, I will have to shut down at least 2 of them. Domestic connections in the UK simply cannot keep up with that much traffic (150GB+ month already with the current limits and average sizes). I can imagine in many other countries running a node domestically has become a rich men thing. This is a trade-off with regards to centralisation.
Out of these, number 4 seems the least serious right now. The rest are all very real. One doesn't just multiply block sizes (the limit, and therefore the worst case scenarios, the attacks, the "stress tests", etc) and then gets surprised that all of that happens.

Ideally fees would be as high as necessary to stop transactions from happening at a rate that the system cannot support at a given time, without losing its properties that give it meaning. Because the alternative is giving up to the centralizers.

There's a lot of truth to the second part about priority and this is part of the argument for not-exceedingly-big-blocks, but the first part is only partly true: miners are not obliged to fill up blocks to the cap, they are obliged to accept and relay big blocks from others and this can create a severe disadvantage for lower bandwidth miners.

You wouldn't burn it all. Also, the decision is not only monetary, Bitcoin is about much more than the monetary amount you have. If anything you'd burn a higher proportion if you care more. The disparity is even higher if you essentially allow vote trade which is what happen with the ownership schemes to varying degrees (the highest degrees in those you don't even need to move coins).
Anything that is proportional to holdings is going to have similar problems. IMO they're even more flawed, leaving aside other problems with voting as a decision making process.
What crypto_voter proposes is a bit less gameable than a scheme based on signing. Proof of being able to move the coins is considerably stronger than signing messages as requires more coordination to game. I can see the design decisions they made are not pointless at all, they are just not obvious at first sight.
But as I said before, you have the ulterior problem that none of these methods is likely to be accepted by a large majority. Then you are left with something that will work among the people who accept it, not big global decisions.

In terms of proof, this does not add anything to permacoin of a pruned blockchain, and it doesn't require any less storage. It's a completely equivalent thing.
We can do that now and maybe make the full nodes prove themselves when joining the network. So far so good, for the purposes of having something that could be more or less trusted for statistical reasons.
On top of that there's a possible reward scheme for participating in the relay network. This is more delicate.

I believe it's the same as miners. Basically the 950 constant enforces 950 on the blockchain, not counting the one you are seeing that is not there yet.
So, 950 on the blockchain means you reject it. This makes that block you are seeing the block 951. Obviously v3 nodes will continue relaying it and v3 miners will continue putting it down. v4 will start orphaning v3 blocks once 950/1000 are persisted in the blockchain.
You can also word this to use 950 like I just did. Basically the 951th is the new block you are seeing if I'm not mistaken. The constant used is 950 because checks happen before relaying. So this means you will relay the 950th block even if it's v3.
The way it's worded:


...it appears nodes relay still one more v3 block after 950/1000 are in their local block chain. This is probably worth testing but looking at the code this doesn't seem to be the case.

I don't think that means absolutely nothing in regards to the issues at hand. Being honest here. MIT have an interest in someone with long proven expertise who is willing to do that kind of job (certainly Satoshi won't do it, he wouldn't give up his anonymity). I see nothing strange about that.

The exchange rate of the future belongs to the future and nobody knows for sure.
Currently, $1 doesn't pay even close to a transaction. The vast majority of txs are uneconomical and being put because of subsidy and to keep the thing up, but a system at a price such that using it a bit too much instead of financing it, drains it... is vulnerable.
It wouldn't even need to be a malicious stress test, if stuff like satoshidice gained in popularity and spammed enough, that alone could make this go down.
Currently we are at the mercy of microtransactions not getting so popular that the strain is unbearable. And increasing the blocksize is not a solution to this. That would just destroy Bitcoin for the things that it's actually capable of doing.

Actually having people understand that zero-conf are not safe is a much simpler model than trying to teach them to avoid double-spends while they still take zero-conf.
Eventually zero-conf will have to work on some sort of overlay that introduces trust, like a solution based on intermediary buffers backing transactions, or a quicker sidechain that consolidates transactions faster, or something like this. But you cannot have blockchain-like security without the blockchain.

I edited for clarity.
In no Universe "2 peers" are enough for the network to function if this becomes the norm. Nodes running like this are harmful and shouldn't be encouraged.
Currently nodes use massive amounts of bandwidth for what home connections are usually expected to carry without interfering a lot with their other usage. This is why people are quitting from running nodes and you can see many real testimonies in the sub including some of these links I put above. I run nodes and yes, my connection is severely affected by it. I can understand most people won't do that without any direct benefit.

Plain Bitcoin as it is today absolutely doesn't scale indefinitely. It actually scales very little until you start needing to make tough, damaging compromises. This is why solutions that essentially take load off the chain are desirable. Like sidechains, treechains, LN, and ideas of the sort. Or obviously the most used Bitcoin transaction system nowadays way ahead of the blockchain: centralised exchanges. But *that* is a massive compromise in terms of ownership, privacy, etc. Centralising Bitcoin to a few datacentres would have similar implications for the blockchain itself.
I'm sure you can just pretend 8GB blocks right now and have no implications, you seem to be doing this in this post several times. But this doesn't make it true.
You don't wish the scalability problems away by just pumping up blocksize caps.

Before I meant as I posted. Over the last few months we are at around 50% but this includes spam attacks. Maybe not far off 50% without the attacks.


Do what? I'm not sure what you meant there.


For the time being Bitcoin as a payment system does not scale much. We know this since long ago, there are solutions being worked on but certainly we are extremely far off scaling as a global pay system and doing it merely with raw txs in the main blockchain is completely hopeless. It will only destroy decentralisation completely.


I value them below censorship resistance. Systems for micro-txs I believe they belong in overlays, so that censorship resistance is not jeopardised.


We did, and nothing happened. I meant that if we did again now, then so much the better really. Barely any fees are being paid. Less that 30BTC a day average. A day.


The focus is on ensuring nodes can survive the bandwidth and hardware requirements. Not size per se. As I said before and maybe you have forgotten by now, I fully agree a cap is not the solution (much less a cap that dynamically moves on a made up curve 20 years in the future).


I don't follow. What did I even say contradicting this??

@_date: 2015-11-05 15:38:26
At that point we would genuinely have a capacity problem. But this is so ridiculously far from the current situation, and it's not like scalability is not being worked on, also you have to keep in mind that this would only be eventually the problem if a sizeable part of the transactions happen on-chain in several different ways (already on-chain transactions are a minority, exchanges transact a lot more than the blockchain, off-chain). It's been monopolising the discussion and development for a long time, probably too much.

Of course, that's a different discussion.

Certainly not as raw transactions.
Right now that sort of Bitcoin would only run in a single server farm, so what is the point about it? It would be trivial to censor, control and monitor all about it from the jurisdiction of the server farm.
That's exactly why you don't scale Bitcoin (let alone to these extremes) on block size alone.

If your definition of "free market" is choosing options independently then you have a very shallow understanding of economics and markets.
The existence of a *functioning, sufficiently efficient free market* on blocksize on this ecosystem without any extra measures or factors is what is contested, not "free markets". Not everything is a functioning free market or even a market.
I'm not going to write an essay here but miners, fees and blocksize introduce dynamics with **massive externalities** and **information asymmetry+incompleteness**.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:43:34
Instead of talking about 1MB or 2MB or 8MB or 8GB we talk about what do we actually intend to achieve, what is the cap for, etc. There's absolutely no agreement there so finding a technical solution that is clear about its goals is not possible. This is probably what you want if you intend to obscure your intentions or achieve a goal without admitting to it. A bit like XT's package trojaned in a BIP101-advertised implementation.
- do you want a cap-induced fee market yes or no
- do you want a cap to protect to spam attacks yes or no
- does the cap achieve anything else to you? (for instance guarantee users can run nodes without much expense, etc etc)
- how are we going to incentivise nodes? (related to increasing fees)
- do you believe users should be able to run nodes in their home connections yes or no?
- how are we going to prevent bandwidth from becoming a centralising force for mining pools?
- what does the cap achieve really and how does it interact with the rest of the system?
- **do you believe that having an unpoliceable, censorship resistant means of transfer between any two users without the permission of nobody is a fundamental goal of Bitcoin yes or no?**
What we have is people throwing out proposals without even admitting to what they really want, and rejecting those of others.
This guarantees a political fight because visions might be at complete odds. Even the point in bold, some devs might be actually against it without admitting to it.

Never mind his pie chart of the future "equilibrium" of implementations full of nonsense and absolutely baseless.
Putting his work next to that of Greg Maxwell is laughable.

You are mixing up two different points in two different paragraphs. I will try to make it simpler for you.


This is one point. It's correct.


This is a different point. It's also correct. Pay around US$ 0.10 per ~350 bytes of a typical transaction, and it will be in the next block, almost guaranteed (can never guarantee miners including something 100%, but close enough).
For some reason you just assumed that 0.05 dollars is not ridiculously low at this point? It is, and these are being included (although not always in the next block).

2 peers is definitely not enough. It's short enough that you are hurting more than helping the network. Core devs including Gavin say that if you are not running at least 8 outbound connections you are not helping (IIRC he recommended against running it at all in that case).




Then again, as I said before, he loves the idea of an institution-run Bitcoin and that's just the way it is (and so does Hearn).
This doesn't mean all XT or BIP101 proponents, or bigbockers in general, support this same view. But these particular ones do, and I think the endgame goes in that direction.

Leaving aside that this number is a bit uncertain because there can be a significant amount of pseudonodes, that amount of nodes is unlikely to be enough. Propagation would be hard to guarantee.
In the end with money such levels of hit-and-miss are hardly acceptable.
Note that for active policies this might suffice because you can always retry, as in RBF for instance, but for measures of what you can expect to be in the mempool without having to put a bigger fee, this will result in unusable, unreliable policies. This can also be enough for MH's lighthouse ideas at the protocol level, which is maybe why he wants to push XT nodes. With just 10% of the nodes it could be expected to work.

In no scenario CPUs or GPUs mine again unless we change the algorithm. ASICs already exist that would dominate mining even if they costed peanuts, because in that scenario mining failed and thus Bitcoin failed.
A network that costs peanuts to attack is worthless. There is no Bitcoin without economically feasible mining, unless you redefine the term to include the resulting POS of that.
Seems like people don't understand the basic bootstrapping of Bitcoin.
strong mining -&gt; confidence in the security of the system -&gt; value, transactions -&gt; strong mining...

Propagating your own mined blocks is only one part of the equation and a rather minor one for miners.
Receiving other miners' blocks sufficiently quickly is the main part of the equation for miners. Latency and bandwidth can become a competition factor and one that is not even symmetrical and this introduces complex dynamics and possible attacks.

Look, I already proved you wrong on the number of peers issue so maybe you should verify facts before you say I'm slandering.
Maybe my wording is undiplomatic, but it's essentially the way it is and you should open your mind and check their views on the matter.
For starters they don't want home nodes. That much is settled and there are many references of them admitting to that.
Now, the degree to which they just want only big business and public institutions to run nodes, that's what's debatable. For me, just this far means "institution-run Bitcoin" because formal big businesses cannot escape regulation and will coordinate with government agencies as they always do, because they have no choice.

It also creates 8x the persistent dust in the blockchain.
They didn't optimise their attack much, with the amount they spent  (which isn't much) they could have done more damage. They could have generated weeks or months of backlog even with 8MB blocks, while taking off many nodes from the network.
@_date: 2015-09-06 19:10:34
You keep on mixing up the software with the protocol and the blockchain. There STILL is no protocol foundation independent of the reference software, but as you know work is being done in this direction.
As things stand, yes it's a problem if a number of miners (or even enough nodes) start misbehaving. Misbehaving having many degrees from the downright malicious to simply ignoring or modifying implicit consensus.
Currently, Bitcoin still depends on coordinated development not to break down. We are not past that stage, and we've had many examples of this being undeniably the case.
I don't think I'm telling you something you don't know, so I wonder why do you keep banging that drum.
@_date: 2015-11-06 10:37:22
Oh so you are pro fee market. That sort of invalidates where your grandparent comment. You are for the same thing.
However, the conditions for a market must be met. If you artificially pump block size or pretend there is a working market already (because it's a pretence, we can see that miners arbitrarily include txs mostly regardless of fee, because the market doesn't work and the subsidy dominates by far fees included).

That is what having some sort of cap intends to induce, under that assumption. Others say that the market will happen and work without caps too but I don't believe that at all, the incentives are too unaligned and it's a surefire way to cause even greater miner centralisation and cull nodes away from domestic users (separate goal).

Pasted here:
Hi Roger,
1. The video above has attracted some questions, even by our investors. I have done my best to reach out to parties who have a strong opinion on the video (including yourself) to dissect and understand what is being shown. The overriding response is it is not conclusive proof of wrongdoing. It however does emphasise the large amount of the bitcoin economy that flowed through Mt Gox and Bitcoinica at that time (more than half) -- to the extent that it was possible to find 'tainted' coins being used in each platform. 
2. Bitcoinica LP existed in the real world, with real people behind it who were responsible for the path of the company. ZhouTong, although the originator of the platform, was not one of those people and has never been named in any legal documents as being responsible for the company. It would make little sense for him to 'make victims of his last company whole'.
There are plenty of other identities that are in the Bitcoinica saga who DO have clear responsibilities from being associated with Bitcoinica LP: Patrick, Donald, Amir, Tihan, PKF Corporate Recovery etc. If evidence is 'damning' I suggest you follow up with real world authorities and these individuals. Internet sleuthing only gets you so far when you want answers. 
3. The court of public opinion can be brutally wrong. Roger, I am reminded of your initial Mt Gox video where you endorsed them for solvency. While your facts may have been accurate -- the representation missed its mark (bonus points for manning up and admitting this in your follow-up video). For would-be internet trolls and sleuths, I reiterate to take your findings to legal authorities if you feel strongly about evidence you encounter -- Reddit or any internet forum will not provide closure for your circumstance.

I wouldn't throw the word "use" because it's vague and most people understand something concrete like trading/exchanging directly BTC for something (at least) and/or running nodes. I don't think there's the slightest possibility that anywhere near 7% of the entire population have done that even once.

XT is not an independent implementation. There are several implementations out there that are either completely independent, or mostly independent, or at least have more actual independent work put into them than XT (including Luke's).
That part of the debate is absolutely misrepresented. Core is working in refactoring libconsensus so that making independent implementations that don't break consensus is easier. They have done plenty of work in this direction.
Nobody denies this problem. Mixing up this with BIP101 and with the extra "package" in XT is a different story entirely. XT is an attempt at centralising development MORE not less. Alternative implementations exist for some time.

This is a fact you can verify easily around here. Obviously the merchant or the bank will pony up the cost. But they cover these deals because, among other things, they get to control your every move. I don't want the same market forces entering in the Bitcoin network.
Currently the incentives are clear and they are monetary. The expenses are clear as well. This means we have to pay whatever it costs to maintain the network and we know for a fact we are depending on the subsidy or mining investment would be extremely low.
See 
Something's got to give. Your coffees may not be cost effective to persist in a secure, global blockchain forever. Compromising the sustainability of the system because you insist that the coffee cannot go in layer 2 sounds crazy to me. If you want it there, pay $10, $20 or whatever it takes.

Exchange speculation accounts for the majority of transactions by far. They do thousands of operations per second already in all exchanges and trading accounts combined and potentially they could do millions.
Bitcoin as a P2P network can never compete with that sort of throughput. These transactions are inherently expensive and by externalising their cost the viability and sustainability of the system is put in danger.
That's why LN, sidechains, treechains etc are important. Potentially, we are talking about settlements between trust-less chains (varying leves of trustlessness depending on the technology) that will allow you to operate in a P2P fashion without having to just give over control of your coins to a company like Coinbase, OKCoin or Circle.

Thank fuck. People have different opinions about subreddit moderation. A community as toxic as this cannot be let to flood the sub with their enormous amounts of agendas, this would be absolutely unbearable as experience shows.


Bitcoin Core is open source. This is a subreddit and that concept doesn't even apply. Reddit is Open Source, it doesn't mean there isn't moderation.


Firstly this sub is not about discussing freedom, but even in that case it doesn't follow that you won't moderate it. Discussion doesn't happen in an ideal world even if you discuss about ideal worlds, it happens in this world and in a certain context.
The logic in that last argument is completely backwards. Precisely because the medium is open to everyone moderation can become completely necessary at the discussion level. I'd argue reddit's circlejerky nature from the upvote/downvote system makes it even more necessary not less. This is even worse than 4chan when you don't moderate.

More context:
@_date: 2015-11-07 11:30:03
If you think a sudden peak is a problem, then you have to establish what cap solves that problem. If you set the cap so high that this "sudden peak" continues to be a problem, you have set it too high.
An exponentially growing cap as high as 8MB in two months and up to 8GB in 20 years is very unlikely to solve this problem at all. Therefore it makes little sense. Something like what said in a cousin post makes more sense for this scenario, but it doesn't seem like the cap having just this purpose is an agreed reality.
I have read arguments in favour and against this "spam attack" cap usage. I personally believe it's one of its current features and probably a requirement, but I don't think the BIP101 support agrees to this premise widely at all. I agree with aliceMcreed, generally speaking the people pushing BIP101 in this sub never admit that caps make any sense and they want caps so high they won't be reached meaningfully and therefore they would be pointless.

Consensus is not possible in these situations and compromise ends up in "democracy". Not good for technical decisions.
Choosing numbers because they feel big or small to a number of people is braindead. We need a scientific process AFTER establishing the goals and the properties that we want to achieve, and then, we talk about numbers, concrete algorithms, parameters, etc. Choosing parameters to fit some undetermined internal goals of a number of people (also not very well determined) this is bullshit politics and it will destroy Bitcoin.

Copypasta of that post for convenience: 
Not exactly light reading. Summaries:
On the first day, we fork, then we unforked (reorged and merged back with Core), then we forked again. All went well. The reorg crashed a lot of block explorers, but the actual nodes seemed to come out just fine.
That night, Lightsword and I talked about stuff for a while. You all will probably find this boring. Nothing happened here.
On the second day, Gavin, DarthAndroid, I, sega01, and a couple others did some work with larger blocks. We found out that the current blocksize limit on BIP101 testnet3 was 9,116,806 bytes. We made several blocks that size. We struggled with the logistics, and I had a lot of trouble trying to individually manage 7 VPSs via ssh at the same time. Eventually I mostly gave up on that and focused on three or four. We need to develop better tools. For the next few days, I think we'll mostly be focusing on tooling.
Performance was erratic. In some cases, a 9 MB block seemed to hit the 5 VPSs that we looked at within 2 seconds of each other. In other cases, we saw spreads of about 30 seconds. I think that timestamp miscalibration may have been part of the issue. Another part of the issue was that we didn't always know who was mining the blocks or where they were coming from. The main issue was probably just the fact that some of our nodes were connected to 6 Core nodes and only 2 XT nodes. Mining was much faster than in mainnet, with 1 block per minute in many cases. In one case, we had 100 blocks per second. Twas interesting times. Testnet is weird.

In practice it would require some secure overlay to anonymously and securely communicate with miners. Note that this moves neutrality to the overlay level, something that XT purposely breaks with Tor de-prioritisation and white-listing.
I like this idea of communicating with miners in more anonymous ways, and there are people working on this. But then remember that nodes have no real incentives at the moment, it could actually cause you to pay more fees if nodes start coordinating not to pass over low fee transactions or charged users somehow.
The equilibrium of this system is complex and currently a work in progress, which is why radical changes like allowing spam attacks 8 times more effective than the latest ones seems like a very irresponsible idea to me.

BIP101 was set activating a high bit, which created a version number like that in combination with v3.
Core is still not using version bits for this release. The implication of this, is that BIP101 registers as a version number higher than 3 and it will count as a "version vote" towards activation of v4. It really doesn't matter much since BIP101 blocks are so few and far between, it took like 12 days between last block and the previous one.

Fully agreed except for the 8MB bit. That's if you want to for some reason maximise block size rather than maximising other very real important goals, like making nodes cheaper to run not more expensive.
But other than that you are spot on: there is no need at all to predict the future when it comes to limitations like bandwidth. Just fabricated crises and doomsday scenarios.
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:31:40
This is exactly what is happening, and this is why XTards are desperate. The miners have decided against them.
@_date: 2015-11-06 11:02:18
There's a massive contradiction in the arguments, because worst/best scenarios are constantly cherry-picked in contradicting ways, as fit.
People are showing capacity tables for 8GB as these capacity was to be achieved any time now ("cliff any time now", "mass adoption around the corner") but when it comes to the problems and limitations, then it's "far in the future" (however 20 years really isn't that far, it may seem so for the 20 year olds around).
Then since January this year and until 2018, it's 8MB. That will absolutely fail to work in the same mass adoption scenarios they are painting. What it wouldn't fail at, is making me unable to keep up my own node and the same for most domestic nodes. This is a very important consideration but apparently for some people it doesn't matter. And what do we get in exchange? 8 times almost-nothing (without even considering the depressive effect on the fee market).
Mass adoption is not possible in the raw blockchain in the foreseeable future, end of. Which is why the other "bitcoin layer 2" solutions are pretty much a necessity in any scenario of mass adoption.

I'm seeing this pattern repeated that the loudest the complaining about the moderation, the lesser it seems to be the level of understanding on what is actually going on. On several levels.
What you are talking about is not even done by mods here. Reddit admins (global admins, not this sub's) will shadow ban people who follow links to individual threads or comments and moderate them in coordination. By the way, if you observe the herd behaviour that reddit's basic karma system promotes you will see this is reasonable.
I hope you are willing to start re-thinking and looking into what really happens here and why some hard choices are made. Nobody enjoys being in constant hostility and infighting. These are measures precisely to try to minimise this.

Core takes some time to shutdown, which can be problematic for Windows. LevelDB needs some time to persist some data before closing and that is what Core is using currently AFAIK.
I guess it could prevent windows shutdown but Windows update can override anything, and it does sometimes. 
There could be specific work for this issue, which really stems from Windows not being great for critical server applications, or they could work on a better DB like for instance the one in libbitcoin, which is much better but is specific code rather than a generic system. But that is a rather major change.

Some people are. BIP101 railroads increases exactly to 8GB in 20 years, starting with 8MB in January.
Correct 1MB is not a magic number, there should be a more objective procedure to determine what is a proper cap (if any is desirable at all, IMO other system should eventually take place than a cap). But the alternatives people are dropping are usually "just this other number" or "this magic curve decided from now to eternity just because". These are shit solutions.
We revisit the problem in HK next month. Not the blocksize hard limit alone mind, but the general scalability problem because having a cap at all could perfectly be improved, too. This devolves into populism because simpler solutions are usually more attractive and easier to sell than technical nuanced solutions. Development shouldn't be directed by angry keyboard warriors in the community, Core and contributing devs will do better I'm sure.

This fabricated doom urgency comes across as really absurd and I have to admit Mike Hearn convinced a lot more people than I would have expected with his "capacity cliff" rhetoric.
That's why some devs had proposed an increase to appease these panicked people (Adam Back's 2-4-x or whatever-it-was plan) but then they started claiming it has to be exponential and start at 8MB or it isn't enough. These numbers are worrisome in terms of current node capacities, comfortably enough to cull out desktop home nodes to basically next to none.
Have you seen the "doomsday scenario" they posted yesterday? it looks like satire it's so hyperbolic, they even called it "doomsday" I kid you not.
Back in the real world transactions remain low, fees remain unsustainably low and despite of that blocks are not even at half the cap in average. Absolutely no doom happens if we touch the cap at this point.
At this point in time the cap is not a great urgency except for political fabrication.

It doesn't need to be "easier". If the ASIC cannot beat a top manufacturer made generic CPU by a wide margin, then that's enough. You are never going to compete with Intel or AMD in production costs and volume.
That is exactly what this research paper is about.
Also note that they keep parameters variable so the kind of hardware optimisations typically done in ASIC are not feasible. This algorithm can really be considered a family of algorithms with wildly different trade-offs in terms of hardware requirements depending on the parameters.

No, not at all.
Normal transfers are generally a few inputs, an output and change. That's usually 275 bytes or so. The average is bigger because the raffles and the nonsense is bigger than simple normal transactions between two parties.
Yours is really many transactions in a single one. What you paid is very little and it's certainly unsustainable as long as the main blockchain is the main means of payment.

Seems like the tx is ok but since the fee is so low and there is some backlog, it got stuck for a bit.
If you are in a hurry, repeat with the same inputs and a bigger fee. This one will be discarded then.

How so? Miners are already generating blocks differently, within the rules. Including those that are generating empty blocks or very small blocks. This is just the way Bitcoin works: miners don't depend on the actual Core code to generate blocks one way or the other, they only need to respect the consensus rules. Since these transactions are legal they will be in the blocks and the only way other miners can avoid accepting them is trying to fork, which is a collective effort (provided the miner doesn't have 50%+ on its own).

For whatever reason, running a node there from a home consumer connection is madness already with current block sizes. And there are many many other countries where this is also the case.
@_date: 2015-11-02 17:28:13
BIP100 does not mean bigger block caps automatically, it means the miners decide. In fact I wouldn't expect any increases to happen short term. BIP100 as originally drafted means that around 20% of the miners can veto block cap increases. That hardly guarantees "bigger blocks".

My connection is very fast. The previous one was as well. Optic fiber, everything is blazing fast. Except I run a node, then at times I have cuts, spurts where videoconf stalls, lag in games.
Don't underestimate the burden of the current requirements. It's not just the total throughput which may push you in QoS depending on your provider, but the peaks. 
There is no individual incentive to run a node other than altruism and, on isolated moments, controlling your transactions fully. If you make it just inconvenient enough most people won't bother.
Think running Bittorrent very heavily but without downloading anything for your usage. Just to contribute to the network. Most people won't do that.
@_date: 2015-03-29 18:33:37
I run one.
The bandwidth and storage needs are substantial and if blocks go to 5+ MB any time soon I will stop running it.
The incentive to run a node for most people is individually negligible.

You have transactions that don't need to be persisted forever in the blockchain, out of the blockchain. Less load, better scalability. Also better than having them do these off-chain operations in the banking sector hidden from scrutiny.

This is roughly how I expect it to work.
No idea why you think this is good or bad, it's pretty much a description.
They call it blockchain, but in layman terms they mean an append-only system with merkle trees for storage optimisation and validation. There isn't much more to it for private usage without strict requirements of anonymity or neutrality of new users. Things are a lot simpler without these constraints.


What you are describing is pretty much it. Maybe you expect more of something for being a "blockchain"?

Or 10000% if you leveraged longed at the low and shorted at the high uh? I wouldn't gamble my BTC so lightly though.
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:14:24
And why is it a bad thing while fees are still enormously under cost? do you want Bitcoin to start dropping halving subsidy while there is no  fee structure in place?
Ideally all blocks should be chock-full and all transactions rejected until they paid a reasonably fee. Currently average is under 5 cents while real cost is above $10. Kicking the can down the road by increasing block sizes only prevents this rift from closing, while at the same time putting a substantial burden on miners and nodes.
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:57:44
Did I say "first block"? No I didn't. People are currently paying under US$ 0.05c as they are persisted in the blocks. Probably they are getting over 1 block wait average to get them in.

I basically support larger block sizes.
Bigger block sizes definitely are in favour for users in terms of transaction speed and commission. On the other hand, the monopoly of mining pools due to larger hardware requirements or security investments against a big block attack may accelerate a less diversified agreement process for further BIPs related to the block size issue.

Original message:
I'm Yuzo Kano, CEO of bitFlyer, AMA!
  
Hello everyone!
I'm Yuzo Kano, the CEO and founder of bitFlyer, a Bitcoin company based in Tokyo, Japan. I worked at Goldman Sachs for 10 years as an Equities Derivatives and Convertible Bonds trader. In 2010, I learned about Bitcoin, and in January of 2014 I founded bitFlyer hoping to provide liquidity to the Bitcoin market in Japan. 
This startup began in a bakery, where our CTO and Co-Founder, Takafumi Komiyama, and I would spend all day coding. Since then, bitFlyer has grown to become one of Japan's biggest exchanges, also providing services such as Bitcoin retail, person-to-person payments, and Bitcoin-based crowdfunding. We also have a unique block explorer called chainFlyer.
I am also the chief of JADA (Japan Authority of Digital Assets), a self-regulatory authority which aims to open up dialog with governmental offices, research Bitcoin business, hold Bitcoin-related events, and help to build AML and security guidelines for this rapidly growing industry.
Since we're in Japan, I'd like to apologize in advance for replying to questions at strange hours!
Looking forward to talking with you all.


Will post an archive if there's anything interesting.

Information-wise, the battle is still on. The regulator-minded have reacted late and this is why it's being hard for them to regain full control of things but they won't give up. They're at it, and they're not doing too badly because people can be social-engineered into giving up their information.

I basically agree with Barry because most of web services have a first inflection point after 10mil users growth, but I think he is little too optimistic.
We still explain what Bitcoin is to users, which is not ideal. Comparing with other internet service growth history, requiring an explanation is too early for mass adoption.
I think a decentralized prediction market could be a kicker even this is very controversial here. Countries in Africa without adequate banking systems may just love wallets and leap frog may happen. On the other hand, there is almost no reason for Japanese to use Bitcoin as a settlement currency because Japanese yen is relatively stable and non-p2p virtual currencies are already everywhere.

Like in the case at hand, security doesn't need to rely on an independent PoW. In this case, it relies on the contents of the blockchain, and the security of the contracts involved.

What ties it to the blockchain is the Bitcoin backing. Anything you do that cryptographically backs your Bitcoin to a reserve from the blockchain, will tie it in some way to the blockchain. This is by definition. I don't see how is that in any way unnecessary. It's compulsory, or else there would need to be trust in the Bitcoin backing itself to some party that isn't the blockchain.
This system ties the backing to the blockchain, so you only need to trust the blockchain in terms of stakes. There is no way to replicate this without the blockchain.

There's nothing much wonderful sounding there. It's very typical to compare extremely unlikely events with astronomical facts, lotteries, lighting striking consecutively many times on someone in specific circunstances, etc.

See for instance the examples given in this thread:

@_date: 2015-10-24 03:26:29
Bitcoin is inherently political. What Bitcoin aims to achieve, neutral censorship-free transactions between individuals, is inherently very political and very radical for the incumbent system.

In your comment you said 2 max connections won't hurt the network, which is notoriously false.
You also ignore all the protocol overhead.
I run 3 nodes, I monitor their traffic, I know how to configure them and I have studied significantly the effect of all the tweaks (see Miller, Corrallo, Russell). 6MB nodes mean 100GB+ just with 2 connections which is nowhere near good enough. Real world it means 500GB+ even with the incoming optimisations.

Of course. However, lowering it to ridiculous numbers like 3 or less hurts the network's block latency and resilience, as does throttling your connection.
At that point you are not contributing to the network and may be doing more damage than support by introducing extra latency. Then you might as well turn it off when you are not doing transactions, that also certainly lowers bandwidth consumption.
PS: it's funny how people downvote real data from people trying to support the network, just because it doesn't support their agenda.

Decentralized vs distributed, and with varying requirements.
In a system with a number of limited players that all can agree a secret sharing mechanism, a sidechain like liquid makes sense. You need strong supervision during the set-up, then you don't need to trust any individual transaction since they are securely signed and persisted in the ledger.


That is simply not true, a distributed shared database typically needs a trusted environment at all times, and can be compromised at any single time.
The blockchain model offers advantages also for distributed computing in many scenarios. A bit like internal networks without outside access are perfectly useful vs the Internet in some scenarios.
In fact many banks really are thinking only about this part. Which, agreed, is a tiny bit of the whole deal. But it's not entirely pointless no matter how much we wish it that way.
@_date: 2015-10-12 15:59:49


Exactly, and anyone with a clue on how mining currently works knows this. They pay this levy to be able to collect the subsidy, which is why they can stay in business so far. Maybe you start now to realise about the seriousness of the fee situation.




They are in a long term investment and their short term incentives don't align with their long term incentives, which is why they welcome the devs lead instead of taking the ball on their own. But forced, they would. It's a wild guess what will happen when they also need to willingly donate mining power during the incoming *mining gaps* after the halving. We may have a situation similar to Doge with hashing dropping and causing a bit of a panic.

You are hogging someone outwards connection that would be better connected to a node running un-throttled and with a decent number of connections. In a propagation network where most people run more connections than you, you are a net negative (simplification, it depends on having a minimum of nodes, math can get hairy).

It's relatively trustless. So far as the parties agreed to sign, the exchanges themselves are trustless. Seems like a fine solution for providing liquidity among a group of exchanges, which is exactly what they're about to implement. They don't require banking or SWIFT or anything. Not bad I think.

I've heard this argument from you and others repeated over and over and over again.
If Bitcoin is not ready for 68 trillion users buying coffees at 10 cups a second, then maybe - shall they make that a requirement - let them look for an alternative, because if you artificially set a threshold we know for certain we cannot meet in the short term and make it a do or die situation, then "die" it is going to be.
Our limitations are not only by choice, and cannot follow our goals. It's the other way around.
Also when talking about block size, the choice is in such far away scope from the goals some are setting it's a non starter. People are talking about all the unbanked of the world or just the US operating in BTC only overnight, there is no fathomably possible block size for that with current technology and current Bitcoin infrastructure. 


It's basic mathematics that such blocks to allow 68 million users operating on the raw blockchain as if it were their account and their cash would need to be orders of magnitude bigger than they currently are. We'd be looking at hundreds of thousands per second minimum. The whole internet would saturate with our current block propagation protocol even if just a few dozen nodes would survive (which they wouldn't in the first place).
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:49:29

These are not BIP 101, they are XT nodes. You can run a Core node with the BIP101 code and it won't announce it (a bit of a stupid thing to do though, since the only point of running these nodes now is populist politics). You can mention it just fine like many are doing, always keeping in mind that you are going on a tangent and not talking about actual Bitcoin.
Next time consider switching to Bitcoin, for instance Core, Core LJR, the ruby node, etc.
Sad to hear about the DDoS though.

With current block sizes and default settings, it's 150GB-200GB roughly. Reducing connectivity would hurt propagation, as would throttling it.
100GB is probably doable still with fewer connections but not too dramatically so, but if blocks grow over 2MB you will simply need a lot more bandwidth consumption than that.
Running nodes is already a considerable burden for the domestic node, that's just the reality of things. Even in first world countries, let alone in poorer and lesser connected countries where we should also have nodes to guarantee that coordination against nodes from a jurisdictional point of view is helpless. We cannot concentrate all the nodes in a few Western/allied countries that agree to every international regulation.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:48:12
Honestly I don't know, but I saw this coming up in my crypto multi and I thought it might be worth sharing.
@_date: 2015-10-18 11:35:33
Yeah that's the gist of it although calculating the exact probabilities and effects is tricky, if you hog connections from other nodes and almost do no relaying work or verifying work, the network is better off without you.
Obviously these numbers change when the network is almost dead and even shitty nodes are better than nothing.
And this is why people advocating for stuff like running 2 max connections aren't helping. Might even argue that Core should disable numbers that low or have you have a separate default agent string if you do.

Oh, and a sub is a privately controlled space, "protests" really don't belong. As you said before, take your private market of ideas concept and apply it by choosing to go elsewhere.

It stopped being desktop+broadband compatible for most internet users in the world at around 250KB blocks. Most home users are already out as is.

That is in the range I mentioned.
Me above:


People don't saturate their lines to "support" stuff without much incentive at all. With blocks bigger than that it would have been about as hard to run nodes as it would be with 8MB blocks and current regular home broadband in a Western country. Keeping in mind that the range of difference is rather wide.
8MB blocks right now would make full nodes plummet down to the hundreds or maybe even worse.

People are rejecting these minimum decency rules because I'm afraid the amount of first-world-anarchist teenagers around here is massive.
This goes beyond the block size debate and for me at least it's a separate issue. I don't lump together XT proponents with BIP 101 proponents with "big blockers" (whatever that is) with... naive pseudo-anarchist kids?? I don't think all these things need to happen simultaneously. I'm willing to concede not all the people who disagree with me on block size policy are complete idiots.

That different miners don't mine the same sequences so that the more powerful miner doesn't always win. The problem has a random element and you might get lucky regardless of a certain "progress" effect.
@_date: 2015-10-13 15:33:38
Yeah but are you aware that 2MB with current fee performance and structure makes us even much more dependant on good faith from the miners? It's anyone's guess if they would continue behaving in the longer term as they are forced to include even more transactions at a loss and swallow higher orphan rates.
That's why the problem is complicated.
Also, regardless of the rhetoric, we are in no real panic as long as most transactions are worth pennies in fees, or even less than pennies.
That's why I'd urge people to have a look at the current state of the network and see how much of a capacity problem we have, and how much of a miner incentive alignment problem we have. And how are these parameters progressing.
That said, I don't think 2MB would be catastrophic. But that's just a guess, and I don't think we should make too many of these.
Also, a one-off update to 2MB, or 4MB, or whatever, is as trivial as updates get. It requires no real development and it would be deployed in shorter time than the length of recent spam attacks, and we survived just fine.
For me the strongest argument for a short term increase would be to appease this unexplainable panic that apparently a part of the community has fallen to. But since I'm not sure that would actually stop the panic, I don't see much point in making us more vulnerable for no real reason.
If somehow we could agree to something that doesn't look catastrophic I'd accept it just as a compromise so devs can focus in actual development again. What I'm not convinced about is that there's a technical reason for it, BIP101 seems madness to me.

If Ripple had a model in mind without their intermediation, and didn't sell premined tokens, Ripple would actually have a very valid usage to unload the main blockchain with federated hawala-style crypto-networks.
So, if Blockstream do basically that, I'd actually consider it massive. Basically a build-your-own-Ripple (that isn't broken or requires centralised servers)... in some sense any scalability solution will have many things in common with that.

Bitcoin as a permissioned ledger either from a bank or from the State is largely pointless over what we already have as users (maybe useful for private entities and for the State).

Your transaction is much bigger than average. You are paying 11 satoshis per byte which is very low.
Averages are calculated on a 300-350 byte tx which is the normal transaction. Yours is about **40 times bigger than average**.
In terms of size your transaction is paying unsustainably low fees. In monetary terms, your 8BTC transaction really should pay more as well.


In my opinion you should have, but honestly you didn't need to. Currently as low as 15 satoshis/byte txs get in very quickly. Paying $1.5 your transaction would be through in yesterday's or today's conditions in a block or two, tops.

Errm. No.


Meaning that PoW is not necessary to have a blockchain, not that a sidechain is "PoS" in the technical sense of the word.


Yes, stake is the backing of the BTC amounts. However for security it piggybacks in Bitcoin's blockchain. That's the way sidechains are intended to work, they are not independent blockchains, hence the name. They also don't have to emit currency, as in this case. These are cryptographically locked Bitcoins.
You are basically arguing that sidechains are not possible or not secure.

Not only it doesn't cause causation, in this case the correlation is strongly skewed from the fact that block sizes were very small for a long time and prices relatively low for a long time as well, being absolutely not indicative of recent history when block size started being a factor at all.

The idea that you are either not grasping or choosing to ignore is that a subreddit is not a public space. There are no freedom guarantees to impose here other than the freedom of its owner to choose policy. This is why ancap puts so much emphasis on property rights, something that typically anarchism doesn't and makes some of the anarchism branches extremely impractical, as no rules can be enforced anywhere and nothing works.
This is not a country or a jurisdiction people are in without their own reasonable choice, nobody is in this sub by anything other than their choice.
And that's why your conflating of political stance and private forum moderation stances is way off and makes no sense.
The relationship example is one typical example of self-imposed rules within your rights. You can be ancap and not extrapolate the freedom of exchange principles to your couple relationships.

Not sure what you mean by "here". Also, the fact that it's not Bitcoin per se, doesn't mean that it will be useless for Bitcoin. If a few mid-size exchanges pool their liquidity thanks to it, it will have a very real and strong impact.


Seems like it's precisely that, only not as advanced and useful for general scalability as other things they've mentioned. Hopefully with some technical bits in common to get us closer to that. I say hopefully because that's just a guess.


Pardon? I'm not in any way affiliated to, or personally involved with Blockstream.
It's simply a promising development to me, nothing more. For a fact these exchanges will pool their liquidity. Blockstream will have some business model not based on premine or on making themselves necessary in the code they release, but rather as consultancy/contract work. By far my favourite model for this, and a departure from "token selling" and premine scams.

The best correlation and also the one that has to do with adoption and economical importance and involves price, is price vs total transaction fees. If we try to impose bigger blocks on miners so that people pay lesser fees, we will defeat precisely what drives price.

The recommended way is using multisig (or M-of-N Shamirs Sharing Secret addresses), then you don't have to place trust in a number of other people and/or systems without much control over it.

Because making bigger blocks loses them money. Including transactions currently costs somewhere between $10 and $20 average, depending on the model you choose and your latency.
If miners acted truly egoistically, most of them would include just a few KBs per block, greatly damaging the overall function of the blockchain. They are somewhat compromising to keep the whole system alive, at their own cost. Short term individual incentives are at odds with longer term collective incentives (see Tragedy of the Commons).
This is why lifting the cap abruptly is reckless.

I wonder if gavinandresen's strawman is intentional or not.












"Honeybadger meme" vs "serious engagement of law enforcement".
No, the discussion here is on how to engage law enforcement. Whether you are willing to concede from the get-go that policing is going to happen at the transaction level as it happens in bank transfers and not in cash. Whether communications can be allowed to be private or whether they cannot be, "because you are going to talk and organise terrorism, kiddie porn, drugs and illegal weapons".
Fuck absolutely everything about that and fuck the disingenuous argument of equating the resistance to this serious new limitations governments are trying to impose with euphoric teenagers and honeybadger memes.

No, because transactions are added on a round-robin basis with N of M signatures.

That is still problematic. Because what is readable in which language? and although 15 characters can be safely not a vanity, we don't have a way to know if there are any valid theoretical privkeys generating the address (which would be theoretically meaningful).

Uhm these would be trickier to track in the first place. You don't know when they are retrievable or not (some random pubkeys demonstrably don't have privkeys, but guessing these is not possible), and they might even be vanity addresses.

I can do traffic shaping any time. At this point I'd just turn off the node if I'm going to introduce extra latency to the network, and just turn it on and let it sync when I'm about to use.

Agenda it is then, the reason of the cynicism. Not too surprised to be honest.
@_date: 2015-10-17 16:28:04
Realistically, late 70s or rather early 80s.
You already have block cipher and asymmetric PK crypto, which is all you need.
Latencies would have been days or weeks rather than 10 minutes, using floppies or tapes to distribute blocks and winchester drums or similar to store the blockchain. Through modem it would have been prohibitive. Late 80s and you already have consumer hard drives with 100-500MB that were relatively common in North America, Western Europe and Japan. And significantly better modems thanks to information theory breakthroughs that allowed up to 9600bps in common copper lines. With that you could probably have 1 hour - 200KB blocks and enough throughput to replicate the first few years of Bitcoin before hitting any real scalability trouble (we are not in trouble right now).
Obviously if you tried back then to have a high throughput and insisted on it, the system would have collapsed just like it would now on a different scale. Or rather, it would all have run in an IBM mainframe.
Note also that these blocks would have the extra limitation that PK crypto of the time was less efficient in terms of computation/space. So less tx per KB than now.
You cannot wish limitations away.

Precisely because the community is ultra-toxic, moderation cannot be kept low key. It goes completely out of hand when this policy is applied.
What you see here is the result of people having completely lost their patience, on several fronts. The naive, first reaction from outside is to assume it's a matter of the moderation being too strict. You are seeing the aftermath of trying the opposite policy. We cannot replicate it over and over until every single random person in the internet has witnessed it doesn't work.
Also, as a sub is certainly not a community project. That approach is well and truly buried.


The community is too toxic for that approach. Too many people with too many agendas willing to make the sub unusable for everybody else.


The mods are not about choosing true bitcoin posts, but about making the sub even mildly useful, which wouldn't happen if every shitpost was given equal rights. User moderation is manipulable and doesn't scale. Works fine for small communities but as communities grow the requirements change drastically. This is observable even in communities not anywhere near to as toxic as this one.


They want something closer to a newspaper than to a collection of tumblr feeds mixed up with 4chan. You adjust to the medium or perish. Ever since XT was launched a lot of the community has been impossible to talk to unless it was about their agenda and conceding to their demands. Only this approach has made the reddit barely usable again.

Also bank blockchains are generally not altcoins, or currencies at all. They usually deal with existing currency. They're just glorified secure distributed transaction databases, which is something the blockchain data structure does well for some concrete requirements.

Sockpuppets are involved always here. It doesn't matter who is winning, who by the way is not bigblockers.


That's because Unidan is a noob. It's trivial to run sockpuppets carefully from proxies and definitely it happens all the time. The evidence is overwhelming.


Of course, and in many occasions you will hear both sides of the argument (whatever the argument is) complain about it. Because even when it doesn't matter, you cannot know.
The important bit is this: you cannot establish a system on a basis that you know is completely gameable, that just encourages it. This is why Bitcoin is PoW and not Sybil votes.
If reddit voting system was solid in that respect, indeed lesser moderation would be workable. But since this is not the case, communities running on a naive basis end up worse than a trollbox. You can choose to move to these communities but keep in mind *why* is this the most popular together with the forum that (big coincidence) Theymos also runs.
Just try to give that some honest thought, I can understand why from the outside it looks a lot easier than it really is.

It's not decreasing (or at least not substantially in a per-block basis). It has been extremely low all the time, and the subsidy halves for the second time in a few months.

Externalities is moving most of the cost of keeping the blocksize to agents that don't benefit of the fees for instance.
This market is far from functioning at the moment, and clearly most transactions are not worth including. *Some* miners (me included) are trying to keep up things working long term by assuming costs that are in no way rewarded. This doesn't follow any market structure, egoistically we would include almost no transactions. Currently the marginal cost per tx is around $10 and the vast majority of txs pay under $0.05

Of course, the difference between censorship and moderation depends on the established rules and the transparency in their application.

I didn't mean it that way. I meant that you have a very naive view on how little moderation can be applied in a community like this as much as reddit as a whole.

People will try again when numbers add up.
For starters SegWit will minimise the possible parasitic trickery going on in hashing. Then hopefully, we'll see commoditisation of the most energy efficient processes that we'll have for a number of years.
I think an opportunity may open up again to mine *without losing money hand over fist*, but it won't be easy to raise as much money as before. Back in ASICMiner days, there were fortunes to be made (and lots of people made them). Now, the proposition is having an operation that "doesn't lose too much money" against the huge existing operations.


In this space, you can count on it and it happened, and you have to be very sceptical and paranoid all the time, to have *any chance of possibly not getting swindled.*
If you are interested in the subject I have a few very good links somewhere, I can post them later (on the math behind mining profitability). They aren't particularly new because this topic is essentially dead now.

When the default is justified it's because that money is lost anyway and pretending it's not just worsens the situation. It's the case with Greece. The alternative to an eventual default is that the EU pays, likely in exchange of sovereignty. I don't think this is a good deal for the citizens of the EU although it's a cracking deal for the elite who wouldn't pay for it anyway. Certainly not a good deal for Greece either.

It's like here in the UK I can happily accept dollars and maybe keep them for a while although nobody will take them in the street. There are currency dealers, exchange agents, etc. You wouldn't say the US$ is completely useless here even though most stores won't take it, or maybe you would say that but you'd be missing out if you could take dollars and there was incentive for people to spend them. There's an added friction from exchanging, but it's not a complete deal breaker.

Because that's not remotely how semiconductor dev cycles work. There's also the issue that you cannot trust your provider to not undercut you when your part of the business is just plugging stuff they produce and they know that.
The Chinese will immediately start replicating your business and undercutting you since day 2, destroying your investment completely. You will need very solid IP patents to escape that, which simply doesn't happen in this space and it's not helped by the fact they can opaquely benefit from the chips without even selling them.
Logistics in this case are massively complicated because of the dev cycle, the lack of transparency inherent to fab processes, and the massive amount of trust required. This ends up with them being majority owners in the operations that "magically" happen to work ("skin in the game" - see Nassim Taleb).

Doing it much shorter would introduce new tail-reorg attack schemes.
If you're going to do that then it would be interesting to add a tx expiry field to have a priority market with fee-size-time allowing for smoother fee markets.

From the ancap/libertarian point of view, it makes sense. If you were there you knew the rules. *Can't stand the heat gtfo.*
Whoever keeps large amounts in an exchange is negligent. Whoever keeps large amounts in an exchange that doesn't even keep AML/KYC data and runs in the most opaque way possible, is beyond negligent (I'll be generous here with the adjective because some people are fucked and I don't want to further aggravate them).

Parent was me as well.
You cut relaying so much and you are a net negative for propagation, hogging on outward connections from better nodes.
At this point you do like Luke and you only connect to the network occasionally, doing less damage. You can also set listeners to very low or zero.
The only way to have a node help the network with 6MB blocks is using hundreds of GBs monthly, and there is no work-around that won't hurt the network.
If you solely want to control your own transactions, you lower your negative impact by only running the node when you need it.
There are other things like denying most txs or things like that. They could also become problematic if network dynamics go in that direction too strongly. Many network attacks would become possible even with many nominal nodes.

Most whales will dump their BCH, although maybe not all of it because of logistics.

Pretty likely that by the time you transfer most batches back and forth, BCH will already be so cheap it will be pointless.
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:33:08
Firstly I'm willing to concede you have changed my opinion on you since you seem interested in these costs. This is a refreshing thing to see. So I'm going to take the time and clarify stuff here the best I can in the 20 minutes or so I have before I go AFK. (In the end I've used around 40...)
There are a couple of caveats about picking an individual block to do the calculations, as there are tricks pools can use to benefit from withholding some hashing. But leaving these considerations aside, the block you picked seems reasonably average.
What you are talking about there is the cost due to latency alone. That is not as high as $10, but estimated at around 0.0001 BTC/tx in an average latency miner (Chinese are usually worse than that, and this is a figure that wouldn't scale linearly with bigger blocks, it's dependant on blocks remaining around current sizes). This latency alone would set a floor of around 0.02~0.03 US$ at the moment. The actual fees in that block were approx US$ 60, block reward ~US$ 6250.
By that measure alone it doesn't look so bad, the average fee is slightly above the sustainable fee (many txs would still be included at a loss, but imagine this wasn't the case, we could have still similar blocks and not much higher minimum fees).
There are a number of costs not included there that depend on the inclusion of the tx: validation costs, maintenance of blocks produced by others, 
And as for lifting the limit, there are a number of unknown effects because several assumptions here (  ) break.
This would be the very lowest, hardest limitation that would push miners the hardest to soft fork down the block size. In fact, this one already works in the soft limits miners set and many of them keep their individual blocks not much bigger than this (the cost of collectively accepting other blocks goes in the other estimates).
Lower limit opportunity cost is calculated as in here:
This is the highest low limit, estimated at around $20 per tx. Realistically one would expect the network power to simply weaken down rather than fees reaching that level, because of economic incentives (unless LN or some other overlay solution made meeting this possible, in which case network power in terms of investment could be sustained much higher, obviously this is a more desirable solution but we don't have this available at the moment).
The collective cost of including transactions is detailed here: 
Note that in any case we would need a compromise solution even at 1MB, hoping for miners not to collude and reduce their latency through concentrating in 1 or 2 pools, which would be a danger that is hard to measure and that is clearly incentivised by allowing bigger blocks and opening the door to more substantial spam attacks.
I'm not going to include any stuff about the halving and about the mining gap pressure that is expected to appear after it, but it would mean that if we don't keep a constant backlog of non-free transactions we might be in trouble at some point next year. This is detailed in the few minutes here (40:55 onwards) :  (paper with details available from this guy)
Currently we should have some sort of collective soft limit at around 750KB (guesstimate) until the minimum fees get above the hardest limit of individually non-losing transaction levels (est. around US$ 0.03 currently, so not that far away).
My personal take on achieving this is have a system in place so these fees are required for txs to get in the next block, and getting forcibly on later blocks if ever otherwise, and have miners enforce this somehow (I'd do this through a message system in coinbase).
Once something like this is achieved I'd be confident to lift the limit above 1MB. But note that the objective is not having huge blocks, a lot of people seem obsessed about that. The objective is having as many transactions as possible for as cheap as possible and for that we cannot only consider end user costs but we need to make sure we don't make mining completely unfeasible and we need consider the longer term considerations like the halvings in block subsidy, the distinct possibility of miners not being able to maintain their current level of investment, etc. Or else the whole system collapses. With PoW, it's absolutely essential that mining stays healthy or the bootstrapping of the system collapses, and I haven't even touched the node validation and relay incentives and the assumptions that might break by having blocks grow abruptly.
If I actually get around to allocating an afternoon or two I might draft a proposal myself revolving around this.
If you want to explain your take on the problem I'd be interested in reading it tomorrow when I have some more time.

In fact you have a whole gradation of tx speeds from around 9 to 2. Updates to the Qt client have made txs bigger because they work differently - optimising for unspent outputs - because of the use of multisig, etc. Txs have become bigger and more complex over time. There are many kinds of transactions now and they used to be very basic just 1 or 2 years ago.
It simply reinforces my point though. BTC is just not feasible as a mainstream microtransaction platform by multiplying the limit by 20 or by 1000. The requirements would be in the millions of tx per second, that is just not going to happen. If it does, not in a decentralised BTC. Maybe in one centralised BTC I'm just not interested about.


Just the proposed 20MB pushes me out entirely. The 1MB block (used to be 512KB) drastically reduced the number of nodes. I have many GBs dedicated to running it and it slows down my internet connection noticeably already. If I have downtime the syncs are significant. I can probably double it but not much more than that, and I run a decent broadband connection in London, UK. I wonder how many people can run a node in Latin America, South East Asia or Eastern Africa.
Doubling it was already a big deal.
And by the way, internet connections are not improving at that pace by any means. They haven't changed all that much in the last 4 years. Same for consumer hard drive capacity, which seem to have plateaued (SSDs are cheaper, so we have much faster consumer drives but not much bigger ones any more - there is not as much demand it seems).

This is not the way it works or even the way it is.
There have been several implementations for years already. XT is not that, XT is a fork with the minimum amount of work to push MH's unwanted changes from Core, and BIP101 as a tool to play populist politics on users.
There are other implementations, that are actual alternative implementations. Like libbitcoin for instance, which is very good.
As for Bitcoin fundamentals, they actually don't depend on any alternate implementations but on the consensus layer decisions. These are currently set by whatever is run in Core. Probably more decisions at the consensus and especially at the protocol level, should move to configuration variables that miners and nodes can easily change without touching the code. Luke advocates for this, Wladimir for the time being is more conservative. Having people run modified code won't have any effect at all because it all ends up decided at a more political level in what Bitcoin miners support and trust. And this is pretty much by design.

This argument is particularly amusing, it's so handily passed as a veiled appeal to authority.
What this does, can be done *better* (if only for heat) by a basic Raspberry Pi machine or something of the sort (ODROID, etc) at a tiny fraction of the cost. This trounces any argument on "understanding" this thing, unless *maybe* if they manage a massive library that is proprietary and not portable.

Thing is, under a given threshold they just shouldn't be in the main blockchain alone (consolidated through a side chain surely why not, or some similar mechanism). This threshold might as well be market decided by the size limit and fees. Not sure how we would agree otherwise.
The original idea of Bitcoin actually revolved around the fact that these limits are workable (1MB, 2MB or whatever it may be, but not something that will make it impossible to run a node to the vast majority of users).

@_date: 2015-02-10 11:25:35




The math is very easy. Bandwidth and storage are roughly proportional to transactions and open leaves in the Merkel tree (with some variation depending on the kind of transaction).
You don't want to keep all the pocket change transactions in the Bitcoin economy forever in the main blockchain because that is simply not sustainable. This will be exacerbated further with every block reward halving.
There's also the fact that by pushing such policies you will break miner consensus. Miners nowadays usually don't block a significant number of zero-fee or low-fee transactions, but they will start doing so if things get out of hand. Because miners can directionally choose which transactions to include in the block. The network can end up being very unreliable. There are already some miners not including low fee transactions and some nodes not relying them. Increase the block size 20-fold and you can end up with a full scale rebellion that will make getting transactions confirmed a throw of dice.


Not everybody. In fact, "everybody" is already out of the question with the current block size and has been for more than 1 year already. But the difference between "enthusiast hobbyist can do it" and "you need big-corporation-level pockets to do it" is qualitative.

@_date: 2015-02-10 13:21:15


    
    Each transaction input requires at least 41 bytes for the previous transaction reference and other headers and each transaction output requires an additional 9 bytes of headers. Finally every transaction has a header at least 10 bytes long. Added up we get 166 bytes for the minimum-sized Bitcoin transaction. For 1MB (1,000,000 byte) blocks this implies a theoretical maximum rate of 10tx/s.
Which obviously is a theoretical limit. However saying "7/sec is the most txs you can squeeze into 1MB" is **wrong**. Gotta be clear with that.


Probably right now. Some months ago when I parsed the block chain in the node avg sizes where smaller and we were getting 7.3 tx/s. This was around last summer which was probably a very different landscape.


From the blockchain in my own full node. Do you run a node? because I do.


Gavin has proposed many things. If you're talking about simply multiplying the block size 20 fold it's obvious that this will just kick the can down the road to admit 20 times as many tx per block, at the cost of taking out most nodes other than high-end servers.
The blockchain can be used for many things. The problem is how effective it will be.
For a worldwide micropayments network, 3 tx/s is shit and 3*20 tx/s is still absolutely shit. There are several times more transactions in my city alone. If BTC were to have the semblance of something you can call semi-mainstream adoption, it would crash and burn just the same with these limits.
This is just short term thinking.

Nope, perfectly valid transactions can bring up to 10 tx/s. That's already considered in the wiki link I just posted. The smallest VALID tx is exactly 166 bytes + 9 per additional output. You can have 10 tx/s or close to 10 for slightly unoptimal txs.


The practical throughput is now aproximately 3 tx/s, depending on the block.


Yes I have the data, it said 7.3 tx/s I didn't just randomly make it up. I'm not going to be uploading the blockchain anywhere, you can do weekly stats yourself if you wish.


Yeah I read them.
Actually, a smaller number of tx/s reinforces my point I just didn't want to exaggerate the problem. I was giving the data I had. If it's 1 tx/s then so much the better for the point I wanted to make: fact is, 1MB or 20MB doesn't change a thing as both are radically inadequate for the purpose of microtransactions.
Now, 17.18GB that means a radically different blockchain and environment than the current tried and tested one. One where almost nobody can be a full node from a home operation.
I'm not saying that's not possible. Of course it is. It's just not the Bitcoin I want. It's a very centralised solution.

@_date: 2015-02-10 12:05:18




This discussion has been run thousands of times in bitcointalk. 
With current tx sizes, 1MB allows for ~7tx/s. Neither 7tx/s nor 140 tx/s (with 20MB of block size) is remotely adequate for a worldwide micropayments network. Might as well lift the limit completely and have a war of attrition, see how many nodes survive if any at all.
Given this limitation, making the running of nodes a high-end server only business (see  ) is rather pointless. But that's just one part of it. Maybe there's interest in having just a few corporations running the network.
Such an increase means changing the game trying to bring BTC into a dead-end. But in any case 1MB or 20MB is arbitrary. Why any limits at all? simply because the practical scalability limits are there and cannot be denied even by the most staunch pushers of "Bitcoin as a business" over "Bitcoin as a decentralised, anonymous payment network". If push comes to shove the whole network collapses.
Not to mention another measures that are there like anti-dust rules. Which, by the way, are soft rules and will require "trusted computing" or some sort of proprietary lock to be truly enforced in the future (or full control over the miner/full node mini-network by a clique, which seems to be the plan). 
1MB or 20MB means roughly a limit of 7tx/s or 140tx/s. It's not "currency of the future" vs "not currency of the future". A block limit based on what's possible while remaining decentralised is IMO much more sensible than one based on a given number of tx/s reacting to whatever the behaviour of the network is at a given moment in time.


At this point you are complicating BTC as a concept and blurrying what's possible and what's not into a probabilistic scale. People want to know if their payments will go through, and which fee is required for it to go through. "Maybe" is not good enough. That kind of nonsense destroys adoption a lot more than deterring micropayments with a limit block size or a minimum fee.


Because it will require an amount of storage and bandwidth that would make it too expensive to justify.
@_date: 2017-07-16 17:56:22

We can get better network performance than now with some protocol improvements down the line but yeah, traffic with 6MB blocks is going to hit several hundred GBs per month with any workable number of connections. Let alone 8MB as has been suggested for January by many including BIP101 proponents.

I see the overlay idea more sensible. Doesn't seem logical to me that transactions lower than $5 require global approval and to be in the blockchain forever. That should be just a stepping stone until just significant transactions receive that kind of treatment.
The trade-offs seem very negative to me. I don't think the decentralisation of the node network should be undermined further. I think we are abandoning a model that works to improve on features more important for a different model that ultimately is not going to be competitive vs pure centralised and commercial solutions. Bitcoin as a decentralised anonymous payment network works. Bitcoin as primarily a micropayment network, I doubt it.

Oh, the commitment and dedication of Bitcoiners of all "creeds" is astonishing. Don't doubt it for one second.


I think it was precisely the "coup" that caused this "instability" but things are not worse, but better because of moderation. This belief is not just pulled from hot air, I saw what happened the first days of the so-called "fork announcement" and guess what? Theymos was AFK for a few days and that was a complete disaster. He couldn't react fast enough to stop the initial snowballing.
We have too many naive young kids here who believe in a very unrealistic brand of anarchism, and this is a problem. The sub is not a functioning market in terms of the quality of discourse, and no matter how strongly you wish it, that isn't the case. Thus the moderation (which you call censorship as this was a public space, which is really sophomoric in political science terms but I won't go much too deep there to save time).


I don't think it depends on this sub, so we don't have to pretend it does. The mods do their bit so populist politics don't take over. Despite of the naivete of many, this job is important and necessary. There was always moderation around here, we just need a bit more because of the reality of the underlying discourse and because the community has grown too big and the noise can be overwhelming more easily.
You can have a look at subs like adviceanimals and askscience and see why and how moderation works, and what the difference in the community is. You can see BTC-e's trollbox or Poloniex's knock-off, see how deep the level of conversation goes. Check out 4chan, tumblr blogs, etc. Different choices for different goals and results. And these are mostly successes, the typical result is stuff like fatpeoplehate, the SRS and -circlejerk subs etc that end up closed down or collapsing on their own. Theymos knows very well what he is doing, don't assume every teenager crying "censorship" knows better.
The underlying differences of mentality are deep and won't resolve through ranting, trust me on this. We have a massive ideological rift between people like Hearn, Andresen and people like Maxwell, Taaki, Todd, Friedenbach to name a few. So far as they believe in a Bitcoin node network that cannot be run from home computers the trade-offs are massively different and the technical discourse is impossible to resolve via consensus or dialogue. It has to be one way or the other, and Core have their way in place and evolving in the way they want. Since the incumbents have the upper hand, the insurgents need to try to stir things up and they will continue to do so as much as they are allowed. *Making things easier for them won't help things*, just don't ignore this bit.

My home node makes my internet choke too on spurts and I'm in London, UK (tube zone 2, so pretty much central London). I've tried all the fastest available. Gaming or videoconferencing are intolerably bad while the node is on.
I do the opposite though, I run it all the time and occasionally turn it off. Considering turning it off most of the time as well. I have a couple nodes in VPS abroad as well but on a data-centre you don't truly control your node.
Sucks to be pushed out of controlling your own transactions, and who knows how many domestic nodes are out there any more.
@_date: 2015-02-10 11:09:52
Because bandwidth and independent miner's storage are finite resources that can be overworked.
Increasing the block size will deter a lot of people from keeping full independent nodes. I keep one myself, if you force me to dedicate Terabytes per year to keep the blockchain, plus a sizeable part of my bandwidth, I'm probably sending the whole thing to sod off.
There are whole regions where basically nobody will be able to keep up with that. This has strong repercussions on the decentralised nature of the network and the possibility that a few nodes may end up running it, which would make it a lot easier to attack and to seize.

The protocol doesn't work like this at all, first you should understand the strain just 1MB already causes and the latency requirements so you don't introduce lag in the network rather than helping it.
Each block you receive you propagate it many times, and there's transactions as well. Uploading is much tougher in home connections than downloading, and nodes being essentially servers upload requirements are even higher than download requirements. And before someone starts talking about bloom filters and relay optimisations in general, we first need them to be in place and understand well the new requirements before making bold predictions many years in advance.

I think he genuinely doesn't realise his moral compass is absolutely broken, like when he doxxed the guy for $50 he lost for his own mistake and published his security question from blockchain.info .

Theymos is preoccupied with using his power to help Bitcoin and doing so in the most anonymous way possible. Wanting/using power does not a narcissist make.

Spain and Romania are in SEPA area, there is not much of a remittance problem to begin with. Typically banks will fleece you the most in the currency conversion (if it applies) but there are services like Transferwise to sort both things in one go. You can make bank transfers for negligible amounts to these countries, so remittances outside of direct bank transfers are rather niche there.
The countries that have a real problem with remittances are places like Philippines, Cuba, Jamaica, Iran, Ukraine, etc outside of the main banking networks. The places where services like Western Union and Moneygram are used regularly, and people pay a lot to make their remittances. In these countries, remittance works as described in the article.

It's obvious how this is practical and preferable to them than the obvious alternatives. Why would you settle in meatspace? or via banks? how about Bitcoin, ad-hoc contracts? that would be incredibly slow.
It's absolutely direct how they are using this for the purpose it's intended to be used.
It provides liquidity across exchanges. It provides a framework so these settlements are fast and automatic. It's also trustless at the operation level, between these trusted parties, without having to verify further than at setup. This is useful. That's the value it provides.

That's a great point, but it's a solvable problem. One could provide a pruned blockchain up to a given timestamp from a safe source with SHA signatures, and let the client download from there.
IIRC the reason Bitcoin doesn't provide a BitTorrent file for bootstrap (some alts do) is that supposedly the new P2P system is comparably fast to the BitTorrent protocol. But that wouldn't be the case if you have to download the full chain in the Bitcoin P2P protocol and only the pruned chain in the other downloadable form.
However the pruned chain client has limited functionality so I guess it's complicated. Might even be worth having a distinct version with just the pruned chain and whatever functionality is supported, is that something you guys have considered?

I agree with him, I also don't think the mining halving periods of 4 years down to 0 are a good idea. If I started a coin I would have done it differently, levelling off to constant growth makes more sense to me.
That doesn't mean I'd try to change Bitcoin to grow constantly and implying it is stupid.
You are putting words in his mouth deliberately, he said "if he would design  from scratch, he would put coinbase reward in there forever" (like Dogecoin by the way, although I did propose this for alts in bitcointalk earlier than Dogecoin existed).

I think that doesn't fairly describe what one would mean by ASIC-resistant. If the cost of producing hardware that would compete with a general-purpose computer is impractical, that means ASIC-resistant "enough".
The existence of problems that are solved most efficiently with the kind of hardware that would also do generic number-crunching well, I don't think that's inherently impossible. Then your ASIC would have to beat the likes of Intel in terms of efficiency per watt at making a generic CPU, and good luck with that.

Most home connections will be throttled even when not advertised as throttled. 40-50GBs on top of whatever you consume will get you there. Home connections are not supposed to be blasting 24/7. I don't like this but this is what is happening.
I notice the traffic already at 1MB/s. Although the first deal breaker will probably be HD space. Big consumer HDDs are costing basically the same since 2007 or so. Running a node is already a burden now, although I can afford it there is no incentive for me to invest hundreds of dollars just to keep it up.

Not everyone... but just about anyone. If blocks go up to just 10MB average in the following years you are needing a business grade connection just to keep up and maybe use the internet as well. Home solutions just won't cut it any more if you intend to actually use the internet as well. With ~15MB it will basically max out home connections, it will be in the ballpark of 70GBs per month not counting P2P overhead traffic. It will also eat up on consumer grade HDDs pretty quickly.
The blockchain grows pretty quickly already. x16 is a lot.




Probably on average, but the high end really hasn't improved all that much. I had 12Mbit in 2010 and I have 14Mbit now. Effective just a bit more, and a bit faster ping. That's about it. The country seems to have moved to broadband and the average is around 10Mbit, just a tad higher than the United States. from 2007 to 2010 it plateaued and it increased around 120% in 4 years, and the last quarter it seems to have plateaued again. 
Honestly I don't see much demand for higher speeds now. People can watch HD now. What people want is more reliability and lower prices, I sincerely doubt a 20 fold increase this decade, there is just no drive for it. Talking about home connections, no doubt backbones will.

In theory 1MB allows in the ballpark of ~~40~~10 tx/s if they are simple enough. Depending on the txs you measure to calculate your estimates it can be somewhere between ~2 tx/s and ~8 tx/s. At the moment I took the weekly sample it was 7.3 tx/s.
Gavin has proposed many things including full changes in storage algorithms which all have pros and cons. Regarding anonymity for instance.

The periods when these people have left this sub has been pretty great. You'll notice a lot of them are incredibly active in producing noise, drama, insults and NOTHING else. Surely this isn't good, even for themselves.
I have to ask, why do these people keep coming to a place they hate so much? is it because it's the one that works? Maybe they should consider WHY are these forums moderated by Theymos the ones that work in the first place. What an astonishing coincidence, right? One could even think it's that these very policies are a lot more conductive to this not being a trollbox than other policies.
I support these policies because I think they are the best for Bitcoin, and so do a lot more people believe it or not. Especially the ones you don't hear complaining! We care about Bitcoin a fucking lot and we are willing to battle it out for Bitcoin to great lengths.

The problem is that recent blocks are often big. If 1MB was a lot bigger than the average block and it was forecasted to remain this way, then raising the limit would be academic. If a block out of 20 is full, then your transaction will get in the next one. The scenario to avoid is that the blockchain could be overwhelmed by the transaction volume.
Indeed if it weren't a problem we could just lift the hard limit completely.
I disagree with the proposal to multiply the limit so radically because it will make a big difference in the costs to run a node, which is a real concern for decentralisation. I run a node myself, and honestly I won't if bandwidth and storage requirements get multiplied 20 fold. I just can't justify volunteering that sort of resources.
It's also a matter of abandoning a model that works (decentralised, anonymous, medium volume) for one that really won't ever be competitive on a blockchain (high volume, not so decentralised, probably not so anonymous). In my opinion, the idea of having a small clique running all the miners and nodes just ends with the main premises of bitcoin. The main premises in my view anyway.
There is a three-way trade-off between decentralisation, fees and tx speed. There simply is no free lunch here, pushing one thing will hinder the other.

Man you're stubborn. 166 is the minimum size with an extra 9 bytes per extra output. In fact block generations are smaller. You can have 10 tx/s, 9.9 tx/s etc they don't need to be very exotic to allow 7 tx/s. It's just that these don't seem to happen much at all. But even if it was worse than that, it would just reinforce my whole point.
I've been looking at blocks from 2011 and the average tx is around 250 bytes. That would give a number close to 7tx/s. I guess this is where the number comes from, it used to be pretty much the norm back then.
Right now I'm back home and I'm looking at blocks from october 2011 and comparing them to mid 2010. There is a consistent increase of the size of transactions, from around 225 to 250 aprox. Things are significantly different in 2014. Right now I'm looking at the block number 330000 and around it. This is exactly 2014-11-14 if you want to check yourself. There is one transaction weighting 31 KB. There's still plenty of 225-260 txs but there are a few multi-KB txs. This didn't happen before, which is why 7 tx/s used to be common but it isn't any more.


The 1MB limit guarantees I can keep my node. If blocks start averaging 2MB I'm already pushing it. I'd probably get throttled just from my BTC traffic. If the idea was to keep blocks small enough for home users the limit wouldn't be raised to 20 or 16 megabytes.


The offerings here are pretty much the same. My connection is not better than 4 years ago. It's about 10% cheaper though.
Yours is? Because in Europe speeds are not improving at all recently. Just mobile is improving, but DSL/cable/fiber is pretty much the same if just a bit cheaper.

This is why L2 is a must, not just an option. Trying to make on-chain scaling inordinately cheap at the expense of node costs is obviously a broken model.

I don't think buying chewing gum requires global approval. That's what sidechains and overlay networks were supposed to be for.
If we are going to go through with this idea of having each block measuring in the GBs then decentralisation is purely academic. At 1MB/block a lot of people and more importantly whole geographic areas are already outside of the node landscape. 20MB means almost every independent user won't be able to just volunteer a full node.
It changes the game. Drastically. For better or worse, that depends on who you ask. IMO for worse, as true decentralisation is more important to me than low fees or being able to have a global network cheaply verify every pack of Doritos I purchase.

If all the debt stands, it's in the millions now. 5 to 6 million US$. I don't think it's reasonable to expect anyone to pay that for a share in a 1-man venture (I'm not aware if he has hired anyone). So that option is toast IMO.

Stable or not it will be deflationary. Which means that prices should go down over time.
I can see no problem with that, other than a vendor refusing to do it and losing business as a result. But really setting prices is something the market will take care about under most conditions and certainly under a deflationary currency it will happen as well.

Right now it looks unlikely IMO. Still keeping an exponential shape with next difficulty jump expected to be bigger (in absolute terms) than the last one.

USD/EUR is a very efficient market and therefore the no-arbitrage hypothesis stands quite strongly. Their prices are set mainly by their central banks and their policies. The different agents of the market play with that.

It's not true to begin with.
The unit was the sterling (Anglo-Saxon times) and 240 sterling weighted 1 pound. Big payments were made in pounds of sterlings (240 sterlings = 1 pound). The sterling was the ancient silver penny. It came to denominate the value and 240 sterlings became 1 pound sterling. Sterling silver originally meaning fine (92.5%+) silver.
So, 1 pound sterling was indeed 1 pound of silver but when it was pure silver, there were no coins so big. That only happened after debasement. Not even the shilling (12 pennies) was ever embodied until Henry II (not sure it was just silver, I don't think so). £1 was 1 gold sovereign under Henry II (presumably worth 1 pound of silver, but at the time coins were not automatically exchanged, people had their preferences and for instance one would pay in guineas to an artist because it was considered gentlemanly, and in pounds to a tradesman). With Henry VIII's debasement most coins were merely copper coated in silver.
So shillings and pounds were coin units when coins were actually made of sterling silver, but never single coins. Bigger denominations were gold. I'm not completely sure about the shilling because the first ones (Henry II times) don't look like silver or gold but do exist as single coins. Maybe an alloy. There definitely wasn't 1 single coin made of 1 pound of sterling silver.
PS: The UK didn't convert to decimal coins until 1971. I went to a 40th year anniversary numismatic event which is why I remember. So not even 10 years before I was born the £sd system was still in use.

Cyprus grew for 30 straight years before joining the euro in 2008. Crisis in 2009, and dead as a financial destination in 2013.
If Cyprus had monetary sovereignty, they might have faced inflation for some years, as they did in the past. But they would have never been forced to literally rob bank accounts. They would have never done that because it's suicidal. They have done it because they EU blackmailed them into it. If they cut their liquidity they'd have blood in the streets and famine, because the currency they use is controlled in Brussels by the eurozone core.

Point 5) is a reply to a socialistic, brain-dead non-argument. 1-4 are all solid, but for me 6) is the most relevant for the kind of people that this article is directed to: LTC as diversification to BTC is retarded. The kind of circumstances that would make BTC fail would make LTC fail manifold under almost any imaginable scenario. 
The only argument for LTC is speculating that enough people will buy into the argument that LTC is somehow complementary/diversification to BTC. It's a very very risky speculation to make in any significant amount. May or may not work, but I agree that it's fundamentally fraudulent.

That is not the main problem. The main problem is, "are they able to truly keep their private keys safe?" and on top of that, their mail safe and their possible exchange accounts safe.
I've seen very computer savvy people get stolen their bitcoins. There are crooks with means constantly targeting people with bitcoins and if they get you there is nothing you can do to get them back.
For instance: get a trojan in your computer and you are potentially done. 0-day? fucked. Etc etc. And this can happen under any OS (although the problem is exacerbated if you use Windows, or if you download shady stuff). Things I cannot control my friends over.
This is why hardware like this is potentially very important. It provides a standard environment so that you don't need to be talking of the trillion ways you can be stolen your BTC if you use "computers" (or worse, smartphones/tablets). The only way you can get stolen your coins in a properly implemented hardware wallet is getting the device physically stolen, and then they will need skills and time to extract the keys from it, if possible at all. You may be able to empty these wallets from a backup before they do.

Stop counting on frictionless conversion to FIAT.
If you're ready to pay 5-10% fees on conversion (which obviously you should avoid) then there are many options, virtually everywhere NZ included.
3-4 week delays are pretty common for *some* international transfers, depending on jurisdiction.
Every time you are counting on FIAT or BTC you don't have, give yourself at least 10% margin for conversion. And that's not even counting price movements that can be a lot more drastic. In short, best not to get into deals with BTC/FIAT you don't have.

I agree that this is a fundamental and unlikely jump, but so was the fact that people started to value BTC and put significant amounts of government money into them. And the latter happened.
If you take into account the amount of incredibly unlikely stuff that is happening around Bitcoin, full economic experiments around BTC are not completely off-the-charts.

Personally I oppose anything with "AML" on it. AML really means disallow private transactions.
However it is necessary to interact with banking since otherwise any "legit" service is going to get banned in no time.
You can still buy and sell goods, and trade cash for BTC without any AML nonsense. Eventually if they effectively kill cash, then you still have goods and services you can trade for BTC and avoid being completely under surveillance.
I understand "follow the money" law enforcement is effective and convenient, but they will have to make do without it like in the good ol' days.
I don't recognise the right of the State to track or tax my transactions, however I know they will do their best to track and tax at will all of my transactions. I'm already taxed through income and through usage of infrastructure, and very "generously".

My main thought is that I hope they don't indulge in featuritis. When they delayed it they started talking about extra features. I hope they don't do too much, or someone will find a tangential hazard in something completely secondary and it will be advertised as "Trezor broken", "Trezor unsafe".

That, and I'm surprised there's no functional hardware wallet yet.

1) MtGox is subject to Japanese law and AFAIK they don't have any open legal proceedings at the moment. Bitfloor can cost Roman a few servers, and he might be liable to a big enough quantity to do time behind bars.
2) one is voluntary and the other is forced. He's forcibly doing this to some people who don't want this kind of deal. Many people trusted Roman enough to take a stake in his venture. Big difference.
But I have to say, I'm just assessing the situation. I don't think he has this option now, his debt has increased manifold and the deals he could have got then, he can't now. I just wish him luck but I won't risk my money there, sorry...

Tutorials and introductions on both OT and BitMessage are full of jargon and they're extremely dense.
I have years of experience using public key cryptography and I had to pause the OT videos several times to be able to digest what the guy was saying and what he was typing at the same time while moving dialogs around. You cannot explain something assuming familiarity with the very system you are explaining.
Most people would understand absolutely nothing. I recommend taking some time to explain things item by item, make a tutorial page with clear steps and links to prerequisites (explained as briefly as possible). People are not going to study your software for weeks just to figure out what it does and find out if they can use it or not.

I'm looking forward to the price of BTC not being dictated by an easily manipulable central exchange.
Right now everybody looks to the ticker in MtGox as the gospel of Bitcoin. Whatever price is there dictates transactions all across the globe. This is as anti-decentralisation as it gets.
Right now, there is a lot of trade happening outside of MtGox. Most of it in fact. We will have an increasing number of transactions happening outside of the blockchain and exchanges. It's for the best that we have a more varied set of references instead of looking to MtGox.
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:24:47
One problem with MtGox is that API creation does not appear in "account history" and it should. It would greatly help tracking account compromise.
Also, enabled APIs are hidden under their stupidly busy interface. They should appear somewhere prominent, people who have them enabled won't be confused by them. People who don't even know what they are, they will ask wtf is that and why is it enabled.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:40:27
If you are long, you are encouraged to buy ASAP, or else it will be more expensive in your worthless fiat.
What they are doing is using BTC as a denomination instead of running to exchanges to tell us how many dollars are your bitcoin worth.
@_date: 2013-07-17 15:39:13
Nope. Not for "any reason". As long as the statements he said are true I don't see how is he responsible of whatever happens to MtGox in the future.
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:08:08
GAuth by the looks of it.
Anyway she had an API key enabled, possibly even before she had enable 2FA. So it doesn't seem related.

It promotes broadcasting your ID correlated to your address. Not a good idea IMO, as it makes the network less private as a whole (more easily data-mined).
@_date: 2013-08-07 11:23:34
Bad move IMO.
Anti-privacy companies and services shouldn't be promoted within the Bitcoin community. Even if they're optional.

True, there are many options for many needs. But the possibilities are there and some are potentially pretty easy to use. I'm not too bothered about a few reference platforms appearing for this (the simplest option) like bitpay and coinbase have taken the lion's share of retail payment for the time being.

You can also pay straight from an exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:29:20
An exchange is no different than any private party with enough reputation. They will transfer you the money in the same exact ways. In fact some exchanges are known not to provide with the transfers in acceptable time-frames, and to ask for extra information/documentation that wasn't agreed to, post-fact.
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:34:30
Wow, so not promoting anti-privacy companies within the community means I'm for illegal gambling and drugs.
I disagree. As I said, even if they're optional is not something I like to see promoted and much less currently. To be honest, I thought this way long ago but current developments do nothing but vindicate my point of view.
Obviously you are free to do that, and I'm free to not support a company supporting anti-privacy, anti-Bill of Rights corporations.

I've had a PhD tell me BTC was too expensive because it was "more than 1oo US$ each", seriously.
Stop assuming people are rational. Maybe we should go for bitcents first in exchanges, if the price hangs on in that ballpark for a while.

I can thoroughly confirm that Bitcoin is going mainstream, by checking the amount of dumb, repression loving liberals posting in this subreddit already. And to some extent in bitcointalk as well.

I'm sad to say that there is absolutely no evidence about this "turning to bitcoin", it's growing but not any more than it has been during past months.
This Cyprus effect story is grossly overstated. People don't turn into something unknown when they perceive uncertainty, they'd much rather diversify to other stablished currencies or precious metals. Or simply keeping a good stash of cash outside of the bank, which is common wisdom in Southern Europe.
Some people are reading on it as it's hitting the mainstream, but not any more than elsewhere.

Roman was unable to pay 25K BTC back when 1 BTC was $15. Imagine now.
I think he's doing a great job, but sadly he made a massive mistake. Many of us would have bid for a small stake in Bitfloor and he could have remained in control. He didn't want any of that, he's the sole owner of Bitfloor. Well, I can understand his ambition but I think he made a mistake and honestly I wouldn't want to be in his position now.
Is it realistic to predict he will get to MtGox's volume with his solvency in question?
Oh well. Bear in mind that this isn't a loan. This is a self-managed insolvency situation, generally speaking nobody agreed to that loan. This situation is highly dubious and should have been dealt with long ago. Now we have to be worried that someone may start looking into it.

The concept of fairness in distribution of wealth is socialistic. There is no such thing from the currency point of view, in the same way that 2 + 2 = 4 is not fair or unfair, it just is. Fairness is not a consideration.

It's always like that and it doesn't matter. These people will have their bills and expenses mostly in Czech crowns, maybe they will import stuff denominated in euros (for instance arduino, some other parts) and British pounds sterling (Raspberry Pi is British) and stuff from China denominated in either yuan or dollars.
It's a fact of life that you don't count on the currency fluctuations of what you paid before. 1BTC spent 5 months ago is obviously not the same as 1BTC spent now. The same can be said for any currency although it's not going to be so radical a swing.
