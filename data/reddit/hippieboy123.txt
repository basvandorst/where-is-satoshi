Ha anyone actually thought it maybe MtGox that has orchestrated this? By having BTC "lost" to the scammer, MtGox are suddenly devoid of responsibility and their commitment is suddenly gone, which will help them get out of this huge mess they created for themselves.

I would really love to see the actual quote
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:30:53
If you look at the image in About Us  you will see the Photoshopped sign. It doesn't fall away with the curve.
I agree... It looks fishy!

How did you read that? They are not preselling anything, if I read that correctly.
I guess if you need to quote, you should quote the whole thing and not just bits. BTW, I am still waiting for my BFL rig :(
QUOTE: 
At no time, will the RIOMiner be offered on presell basis. With Indiegogo, we are not selling units, but offering supporters demo units that they can keep with the condition and understanding that the units are pre-production and that feedback on the units, will alter the final product. All pre production units will be mining at the stated 400Gh/s rate, however there may be changes to some hardware/software specs. Certain replacement parts will be offered free of charge on the demo units to update the specs, should the need arise.
Parts Availability:
As part of our business model, we will have parts available for purchase on our website, that include, pumps, radiators, LCD displays etc, so that you can maintain your unit as the need arises.
We currently have financing in hand for the first 150 units. (edit error)
This project is not intended for the hardcore Bitcoin Miner, looking to secure equipment now. It is intended as a project for hobbyist to delve into, help refine the RIOMiner and get it to launch, which is the purpose of Crowdfunding. When the RIOMiner is available for purchase on the website, it will be because of the support and feedback we initially received from Indiegogo Supporters!

Thanks for the message. I came across the link and thought it was something worthy for the bitcoin group. I understand what your saying and its good to have controversy.

Hi Vertigo772... Feel free not to click my posts.
Thanks for letting me know about the image issue. I fixed the permissions.

Why couldnt they give the perks to the ones that would need it most and charge those higher up on the pecking chain more... It gets tiring hearing how just because your wealthy, shouldn't make you any less receiving of perks. That sort of thinking doesnt benefit society :)

Ahh... now I need to go see some reruns... :)

Sad loss, but life has a way of turning things around. 2000 may only be a few months away :P

Probably not.
I would have thought it would be wiser to heat your pool in winter :)

Understood. Thanks for clarifying that. There is no affiliate link, its not my site and its not my content.
It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way, but you should sort of consider yourself on thin ice. So please pay careful attention to the rest of these bullet points.
If people historically upvote your links or ones like them -- and we're talking about real people here, not sockpuppets or people you asked to go vote for you -- congratulations! It's almost certainly not spam. But we're serious about the "not people you asked to go vote for you" part.
plus I have also made many comments too... 
Quoting is great when you use the whole context... My quote is just to reply to the bit you left out.

How can it be tax evasion if the tax is not constitutional?
Just because some twit says you have to pay tax doesnt mean you have to.
There once was a twit who couldn't run his business properly, so he told the world that Thailand has made Bitcoin illegal. The whole world jumped on the BS and believed it. Of course its not true, but the majority chose to believe it without looking into it.

I have seen some BFL but no kncminers on ebay. Perhaps I am not looking hard enough :P

Someone reported that it installs a tracker... So I am just doing my bit to help the community.
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:32:50
Yes its a tad old but when I came across it, I thought it was fantastic. I hope others who never had seen it before enjoyed it as much as I did :)
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:59:19
Publicity stunt... they suck so they need to try and cause controversy
@_date: 2013-11-04 10:59:20
I see your point :)
@_date: 2013-10-25 20:34:36
Its already being reported on some other sites now

A lot of it had to do with faith.

So not returning the bitcoin is ok then?

Looks like the guy just needed some help and is getting some work now.

I started using Bitcoin back in the 90's... I was so ahead of the times.. Go Duran Duran :)

Is this for real? I know things around the world are going nuts, but cmon.. !
@_date: 2013-10-25 19:16:51
Yeah, I would say KNCminer as well. The other players are just marketing CAD drawings, so at this stage I dont trust them.
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:28:40
Your right... If they did, they wouldnt be where they are or not as quickly. Thats where MS falls short
@_date: 2013-10-26 13:29:40
Well done. Keep us posted :)
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:02:13
They state they closed due to lack of customer interest. With all due respect, I didnt even know they existed. Perhaps they should be blaming thier useless marketing team, SEO team instead of "lack of customer interest"... I notice they have some other projects running too. Hopefully they will do some marketing instead of "building it and HOPE they will come".
I dont know of any alternative, but the door is open for someone to jump in and take over where they failed.
@_date: 2013-09-29 17:56:15
Id be interested to know too. Please enlighten us :P
@_date: 2013-10-21 08:34:01
I really hope so. Its been a while so maybe they didnt get the support they wanted. I hope thats not the case and they are busy editing the next video :P
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:22:28
Once its stable, I am sure the trust will be there :)

Yep... I think that when I just ask the guy to hold up his phone with his QR code on it and just send some dust, that should convince him... It cant be done with conventional means, which is why proving this idea would be good for the community... :) 
If this could be done publicly so the event could be planned and I somehow can randomly choose a viewer to try this social experiment with, then it would be super!
@_date: 2013-11-13 11:15:08
Well done... Nice to see an entrepreneur in action!
@_date: 2013-10-18 10:10:02
Firstly, WTF was that all about and why are comments closed... Surely its suppressing discussion.
I read LITTLE about regulation and more about a mindset that I agree just in part with. The article assumes to much, denigrates other peoples thinking.
I commend Amir on a lot that he has done, but FFS, I slam my door shut when bible bashers come around. Stop preaching Amir and just stick to the technical issues and regulations. Let society find its own way.

Whats the point of Coinbase then?
I never heard my bank tell me that.
I know other countries have banks that close up when there is no cash, but thats more the fault of Governments and not the currency itself...

The feedback page is at  and we do know that KNCminer are watching.

Ummm... I dont believe Indiegogo is a shop and they are not selling anything.
Its a perk in return for a contribution to the project.
I only posted the link. I promise to be more careful next time!

He is too lazy. Cant even get his forum working. What do you expect from a kid?
@_date: 2013-10-27 09:15:50
He doesn't deserve it, but all he is doing is asking. He has obviously done fine till recently. He is a bitcoiner, just like all of us and has fallen on some tough times. I dont know if I would have the guts to do what he did, then again, I dont have a family and wouldn't know what it would be like to be in that situation. At least show the guy some decency :)
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:45:52

I would go as far as to say worthless. It will still mine, but the ROI has just been extended. Of course it will eventually cost more to run it than mine it, but then you have a great bookend
