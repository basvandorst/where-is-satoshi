I've done the same!  1 and a bit btc for £166 and and oz of silver.   Hopefully we'll both be gazillionaires!

In fairness to him he got it bang on in August last year

Right.  I have no IT, Physics or maths knowledge.  I randomly got interested bitcoin in 2012.  However I lacked the computer skills to buy or mine them.   I liked the idea.  My mate however, is IT legit.  He made me setup up the wallets for "empowerment" but he's done everything else (especially buying).  Apparently this is good practice that good documentation makes everyone aware.  Also he was not surprised by state sponsered attack.  It's fine, just check the binary (I think).  He explained binaries and the key on the Web page but I have no idea.  Basically this is nothing much.  I am a layman.  Not selling ever.  Either £0 or gazillions!

Hoping someone can clear this up for me. I understand that code running on Ethereum can be copied and pasted into RSK and it will run.  Everyone knows the vast amount of ICOs raised on Ethereum.  Ethereum has proved itself to be a great way to raise money. However,  whats to stop a developer with an ICO on Ethereum, copying and pasting their code and buggering off to RSK and bitcoin.  Could they walk away with the ICO funds from Ethereum?  Surely if they don't create something (I'm sure 99% won't) then the investor loses their money.  Technically, if they complete their project using Rootstock, then they haven't created anything on Ethereum, meaning the tokens they have issued to investors using Ethereum will be useless.  A bit conspiracy theory here and I could be wildly wrong.
EDIT:  RSK is claiming 200 on chain tps.  Isn't Ethereum around 15tps?  Would that alone encourage developers to migrate?

Thats a pain in the arse!......  From recent news releases (Lightning network, Rootstock (RSK), Schnoor signatures etc I think it will be fine in time.  I'm happy to wait and see what plays out.  I'm not one of those guy who sold off on the day of the fork on ideological reasons.  Who knows, maybe the BCH guys were right?!?! I agree its not ideal, but I'm happy to keep 90% in tin hat cold storage and take my original stake and pay a few $ to do it.  I own equal amount of BCH and BTC.

Damn right it was.  I wonder Halo Wars may be a good replacement :)

Well done with the lifeboats.  They've been accepting it since 2014/2015.  They were the 1st in the UK I believe.  They deserve it!
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:07:44
Yes this appears to be the case.  Thanks.  Inputs appreciated.  Just scared I'll send a bit to an an exchange and I'll have to wait for hours while the price tumbles :/  In the past when I've bought its fallen off a cliff.  I expect that prior sell and then a massive price spike afterwards.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:16:38
I don't care about $20 right now.  If the situation is the same for the next few years then it will be bad for BTC.  However, progress seems to be being made for BTC and BCH so I'm happy to wait.  The internet and computers were shit in 1995 too.  I remember losing my mind having to do stuff in MS Dos when all I wanted to do was play command &amp; conquer! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:28:33
Just realised bitstamp supports seqwit.  Shall I just pay $20 to be safe?

Mine clearing.   Also the half trust. Did a lot of good work in Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos.  Read about Phonsavan Laos.  About years old.   They had to move the town due to so many UXO deaths
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:18:08
This is why I'm worried about getting the right fee.  I don't to be greedy.  I don't care about what the situation should be, just what it is.  Thanks for the input and sorry you're still waiting.

Royal lifeboats have been accepting bitcoin since 2014.  They have not had many donated.   I don't have many but fair play to you for what you are doing and congratulations 
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:20:36
errrrrrr.........hang on 
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:04:43
you could well be right, but I ain't getting my hopes up yet ;)  I think some bitcoiners (Andreas too) are against it.
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:40:29
He says fintech, but not bitcoin.  Still, things could get interesting.  If  the ETF doesn't happen soon, another one will appear eventually later down the line.  Still....would like to see a little boost in my balance ;)
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:40:45
Whats the massive cube with 456604 on it?  Its not total btc is it?  Fuck me if it is
@_date: 2016-11-21 12:04:43
The Lifeboats!
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:32:12
Thanks for that.  Thats pretty cool.  Quite surprised how many wallet addresses for charities in proofofdonation.com too. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 10:18:30
cool cheers
@_date: 2016-09-02 10:19:02
Is this potentially serious?
@_date: 2016-09-15 10:19:06
Serious?  if you're not joking then fair play sir......you are sorted!

Solved!  I have funded a channel.
 If anyone else has this issue here is how to fix it.
Go into Bitcoin Core.  Click Help, Debug Window then select Console.
walletpasshrase "yourpassphrase" time in seconds to unlock wallet
This is what does it.  Hope to order a sticker or some shit today.  If it works then I couldn't give a shit about the bitcoin price right now!
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:24:16
Nothing in  his wallet so far!

Why is there no deutsche bank share price available today?
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:30:30
Thanks for the response I appreciate it.  I currently use armory and for a non techy like me was damn difficult.   I thought electrum was the very similar.  I don't think the kid I'm trying to help has the skills or the spare computers for an offline machine.  He asked me how to buy 10 or 20 quids worth a week so I tried to explain it.  I realised due to his age he's limited to a bitcoin atm.  I hoping it may open his mind a bit and help him save.  I wish I did at that age!  I thought the risk for a few 100 quid at the end of the year a XAPO wallet would suffice.  He can buy at the atm and vault it from his phone. Too young though.  Are there any decent services like XAPO?
 Have to be 18 to have though.

Hi.  Need some advice.  I have been into bitcoin for a couple of years. Done me well.  However I am working with a young guy who is 16.  I am at a loss of what advice to give him.  Any suggestions for wallets for an under 18 year old in the UK will be very appreciated. He is intending to put in 10 to 20 quid a week max so bit pointless buying a trezor now. Even xapo is age restricted now (don't remember that in 2015).
@_date: 2017-05-16 19:46:04
you're probably right to!
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:04:35
Thanks.  My tin foil hat was about to go on!

Fair points but not even anything related to crypto at all.  Not ripple, blockchain or anything.  
Yet dropselling (yes I looked at it many years too late) is all over my facebook.  Same as Amazon.  I look at a holiday and flights all over my feed.  Yet nothing crypto at all.....even though I google it every day.  Just pondered the thought thats all.  Not even Onecoin.  Thought they'd be all over it.
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:56:02
Oh well.....at least its free ;)
