Hobbyist content creator == 13 year old kid making YouTube Poop videos.
Professional content creator == the kind of people who bring you Interstellar, Breaking Bad, etc.
Name one person who would willingly spend 165 million dollars to create a fantastic, quality movie and then give it away gratis? Where's the incentive in that?
No, I don't think work would take up 100% of people's time. But then think about how long it takes to produce quality content. Brainstorming for ideas, writing the script, editing the script, storyboarding, directing, filming, acting, voice acting, compositing, special fx, editing, soundtrack, etc.
Think about how long it takes from the time you hear a movie is coming out, and then going to actually see it.
Probably 2-3 years, and thats with hundreds of people with the ability and security to spend all day, everyday working on a huge project.
If everyone working on a blockbuster film had to juggle 2 or 3 alternate jobs to make it work, then the movie would probably take twice or three times as long to come out -- and thats assuming they'd be willing to sacrifice 6 years of their life to produce something that brings them no economic benefit.

If you don't want content creation to be a viable career, then how will anyone have the time to create content for *you*? They'll be too busy driving taxis and cleaning chimneys, right? Peoples' priority to be fed and pay for shelter tops their priority of making works of art for xbtdev to personally enjoy. 
So, if making those works of art that xbtdev duplicates instead of paying for won't keep the creators fed or give them shelter, what content will even exist anymore for xbtdev to duplicate in the future? None. It'll all disappear, because they're gonna drive taxis and clean chimneys instead.

If you'd like a desktop solution, MultiBit HD would also work to import a wallet -- it's exactly what I did.

Not necessarily new, but I just joined here a couple of days ago. I played with Bitcoin a year or two ago when I was in high school, but sort of forgot about it until recently.

LOL, I thought you were going to point out how the phone's time at the top says 10:23 PM, but the transaction window in the middle of the screen says 8:55 PM at the bottom ;p

The whole reason we vote is because of personal philosophies though. If your personal philosophy is pro-choice for abortion, then you would actively not vote for politicians that are anti-abortion. Compiling a list of politicians who are anti-abortion is just a good way to avoid voting for them. 
If your personal philosophy is pro-Bitcoin, then you would actively want to not vote for someone who is anti-Bitcoin. It's that simple. You need to show elected officials what the people want. Compiling a list of politicians who are anti-Bitcoin is just a good way to avoid voting for them. 
I would agree with you, "Not everyone has to think like you" if we were talking about trying to convert random strangers on the street. We're talking about people whose sole job is to serve the public. Hey, I am the public, you must serve me. If the politician doesn't want to vote in the interests of the people they supposedly represent, then they don't have to be a politician. 
EDIT: FWIW, if the politician has a personal opinion about Bitcoin, one way or the other, I don't really care. But if they are trying to legislate bans for Bitcoin, I would be extremely against that. I mean, would you let a politician ban bitcoin in your state/region and shrug your shoulders and say "meh, oh well, I can't oppose that! People are entitled to their opinions!  Even when it negatively affects my daily life!"

Doesn't Circle already do all of that? Bitcoin wallet + send money to anyone else + buy/withdraw bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:17:41
Yeah, I'm not really sure how that's going to be enforced...
@_date: 2016-09-19 02:21:42
That's funny. I had no idea that some higher power has banned the ability to hold both Bitcoins and altcoins simultaneously.

Because it would have been detrimental to the storyline. 
The tech consultants are necessary for representing hacking realistically, which is important to the storyline.
They ignored the possibility of buying drugs from the deep web because that was important for the storyline too: if Elliot just bought his drugs online with Bitcoin, there would be no need at all for Shayla's story arc, and she would have been a pointless character.
