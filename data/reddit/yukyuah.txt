No, I volunteer for an internet anti-scam organization.
@_date: 2014-11-26 14:19:57
I wish the community would do something about this scam company.
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:33:52
Tin foil hat?
Good luck with carded items then,
Of course criminals are going to exploit this.

They're paid(hashpoints) to get upvoted,
You lose money(hashpoints) when you get downvoted,
Hashpoints can later be converted to paycoins which are suppose to be worth $20/each
400 Hashpoints = 1 Paycoin
You get 100 hashpoints which is roughly $5 if you're extra keen and the CEO upvotes you, you will get upvoted for doing such actions as acting as a shill on other forums and to protect the company. 
Hence everyone is so joyful and act like they're in a weird cult where you're disowned for questioning the leader. If you read any history, this never ends well.
No self-respected company has to pay their users to love their product, it should com naturally, and Josh can't handle the fact that people want to question him, his company and his previous failures before investing money in them.
If you doubt him on the forums, he will personally message you and tell you that he is NOT interested in having you as a customer.. it happened to about 5 of us as we know.
Josh has it that way so noobs think gawminers is the best thing in the world and they will take huge loans out to invest in them.
Biggest scam of 2014/2015 in cryptocurrency will be Gawminers I am betting 1 BTC on it.

Don't click and don't join!
Avoid wasting any time on said scam.

Josh Garza will pay you to keep your mouth shut, I guarantee he will offer $$$ to coinfire to shh up.

They're being investigated by the SEC currently, believe me or not.. 
On Friday Dec 5th I had a 30 minute conversation with a SEC investigator, I only made my report a week ago.
When I was talking to the person it seemed like they were quite familiar with Bitcoins and Gawminers.
I've obviously haven't filed the first report and I'm sure there  will be a ton more.
Once the SEC gets ahold of GAW, they're GONE.. and the bitcoin community will have a party.
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:11:20
Josh can't sue everyone!
We should have a forum or blog with all the lies and deceit made by Gawminers. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 12:03:55
You're still advertising a scam company.
I'd advise you remove your article.
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:57:34
lol, talk about being paid off to be a shill.
Will never visit coinbrief.net again and will tell others to follow.
I hope these sites shilling gaw realizes they're advertising an obvious scam.
@_date: 2014-12-08 13:54:11
Its because they don't have miners.
Where is the 500+GH of scrypt mining hashpower you should have?
Just because people are mining scampoints, you got rid of all your miners?
There are several SEC investigations going on and one FCC investigation.. If you have money invested in them, I'd pull out now.
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:21:04


Are you paid to say that? Because only brainwashed idiots with no education would stand up for Josh Garza.
If you're into scamming people like Josh Garza, so be it.. just don't go flaunting it around here.
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:51:14
Oh, you're not posting under one of your other shill accounts?
You're running a company that is morally wrong, you gave everyone the appearance of mining for the last couple of months since you "took over" zencloud. Your company is as shady as any other crypto scam companies. You make false promises and you lie every single day, but thats okay, your TOS states that you're allowed saying whatever you want on your censored forum because it says that it is recommended not to rely on anything said by you.
Not one BTC in your hotwallet traces back to anything mined. You're simply recycling BTC which is FRAUD, and there is clear proof as everything can be tracked down. There is not a single trace of you doing any mining what so ever, and all you have is a couple pictures of some random miners which don't even amount to 1/8th of what you sold.
Now you're covering up your failed zencloud project by starting something new which will get crushed again because no one is interested in being scammed. I hope we get the word out that you're not a trusted company and that you have to censor/ban people to help your sales.
Most of us are counting down the days until your company gets raided and you get sued into oblivion. Your little cult will not stand up for you in court.
You're destroying the crypto world!
Now stop posting on reddit and go scam some more innocent people out of their hard earned money. You're exactly whats wrong with America and I am ashamed of wasting 5 minutes of my time writing this reply to a greedy piece of scum.
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:45:35
Don't submit to them Mike,
I'm sure you could crowd fund enough to help you against the battle, GAW is hated among most of us.
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:53:34
Enjoy the gold, 
If you need funding or help against gawminers, we are a small team that would gladly help.
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:58:41
Most people here have been scammed by GAW so we know what we're talking about.
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:09:34


Please do so.
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:37:44


No one has made 'tons' of money with gawminers you liar, the only money you will ever make with gawminers is gone, Prime jumped from $16 to $40, thats because a huge group of uneducated fools thought gawminers was a good investment.
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:21:22
How do you know an item is being carded to your house?
Then the police will show up and then you're out of bitcoins, the item and you're being investigated.
What a dumb idea Purse.io is.

The fact that Josh has to 
1) Pay shills to stand up for him via hashpoints.
2) Post daily on a forum where everyone sucks him off.
3) Pay people to keep their mouth shut.
4) Break promises daily,
a) You were promised to be allow custom pools:
b) Primes were suppose to be able to mine SHA-256 3 months ago even though its a simple code switch for the devs. (They haven't done it yet because they would actually lose money).
c) Transparency, you guys were promised transparency from the start but all that was shown was 'zenpool stats' which stated that you guys were mining 50% scrypts hash (300GH) at the time when there was zero evidence of it.
5) He is sending out cease and desist letters left and right:
Even though if you read the reddit post about it, there are a ton of Red Flags that come up. 
  
@_date: 2014-12-08 02:34:13
Remove the page off your site, Gaw doesn't need publicity, they're full of shit.
You and your site have lost all credibility.
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:10:28
Bring the lawsuits on, we will crush Gaw
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:44:10
Yeah avoid this company at all costs.
Also avoid gawminers too if you find them among your searches. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 12:40:51




jumples = gaw_ceo btw

@_date: 2014-11-27 12:13:04

@_date: 2014-11-27 12:41:38
jumples = gaw_ceo
He creates fake shill accounts to protect his scam.
It has been confirmed before.
