Mine only take up 100 K.
So you should be safe.

One of the reasons I've never ventured into the Apple walled garden. You can do anything you like, except for what we don't.

Good call.

Started building ?
bordellos are physical things that take a lot of capital. Not something you do when bored in the weekend.

I think coinjar sells at 1.1% commission.

I just checked the entrails of a chicken, and it tells me there will be a 67.2 % drop starting at 02:52 AU EST 28/11/2013 CE.

Late to the party, just over one, planning on building to 2.2 (One for me, and One for the SO), if we get a ten fold increase I'll sell the .2 so we have no fiat loss.

Probably, I'm a buy and hold guy, buying through coinjar. So I don't really want a MtGox account. 
I was just pointing out that there is an option to trade without dealing with conversion fees.

This seems very credible to me.

MtGox runs an AUD exchange
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:13:13
Too late ?
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:10:30
What do you mean "we", yankee ?

The Telegraph is one of Rupert Murdock's misinformation rags. The depth of research and understanding shown in this article is what we expect.
Not expecting a crash on the AUD exchange due to this.
