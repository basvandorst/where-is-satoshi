$200 in overdraft for a single charge does not happen. It’s probably $30 each charge and the person agreed to sign up for it/didn’t opt out at time of account opening. Their own stupidity.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:38:20
It is at a lot of locations, people just sign up for it  without thinking about it and then get pissed when they have the fee occur 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:24:57
You’re limited to 6 transfers out of your savings account quarterly by Reg D (I believe, I work on investment side) and they can legally charge you for transfers out of savings beyond that.
Also, you can opt out of overdrafts easily. But hey, you do you.

They would just kill you eventually and then you can enjoy all your money in the after life.

So is this different than the Hashlets Garcia used to sell? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:05:45
Certain smaller cryptos are up a ton this week
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:46:32
Unfortunately they fuck with our business in many ways, outside of crypto stuff. They add more work and headaches than they provide in assistance and we generate their pay...ugh
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:12:52
Of course my buy order wasn’t quite hit at that dump, god damn, wanted the cheap coins
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:39:03
No man, it’s cloud mining. They literally don’t even have to be mining and can easily run a ponzu scheme on you.
Reading their subreddit is hilariously just like Garcia’s Hashlets. Y’all are just a disillusioned as they were.

You need a cost basis and ending sale amounts to calculate your profit. So yeah.

Dude bought in with his savings at the AH, he had that coming unfortunately 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:17:38
Not sure about the first one, i Work on the investment side for a firm so I understand a bit of tax stuff but not a ton of detail.
If you bought ETH and LTC, sold them to exchange for BTC then you need to report it. Class families aren’t a thing for crypto
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:11:59
Not servers, it’s the Eth network that can’t handle the traffic now 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:52:18
Probably sell orders to beat the $20k crowd. Big drop, someone dropped their coin and cashed out I’m betting 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:28:38
For people starting off the $15-20 is a large amount. Average joe puts $200 in and now has to pay 10% to move it to a private wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:16:33
Majority of banks have weekly or twice weekly deliveries. You order online via the site and schedule the amounts you need and they’re delivered in the armored trucks. Most keep a few hundreds thousand tops I the vault depending on how busy they are weekly.
Source: worked retail banking in college before moving investment side and helped with delivery shit.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:29:11
How do they sell out? I wonder what the fees are for €10?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:29:40
I work for Wallstreet, when do I get my “evil” card?
But for real, our clients have been asking about Bitcoin and Ethereum a lot these last few months. Technically we can’t make the trades for them but we have been showing them Coinbase/Grax. A lot of them have been dropping five figures in and holding on.
Barron’s had a good article that got a lot of folks interest this month as well.
But for real, we’re aware of Bitcoin and some of us own it personally.
Also, I’m not an investment banker, work on the private client group side. So we only handle a few hundred million across a handful of clients vs billions.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:55:31
An attack? More likely it was the flavor of the month and everyone and their Grandma wanted in on the action which currently bitcoin can’t handle hat amount of transactions
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:14:37
Yup. Work for a private investment group. Some of the advice and diversification, or lack of it, here is...concerning. But hey, for every loser there’s a winner. Who am I to question.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:29:27
I work for “Wall Street” (and personally own Bitcoin and ETH, gasp)...yeah? We do reimburse clients when shit gets fucked or messed up.
That $500k that was supposed to be incepted and invested the last 7 months but someone forgot to finish the final step? Yeah, that comes from our pockets and we make it right.
So yeah? I guess we do back it up? Y’all dealing with shady people if they aren’t.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:11:37
I work for another, larger firm and our clients alone have been calling that amount. Luckily for my team I’ve been watching bitcoin and Ethereum for a long while. We aren’t permitted to assist in purchasing (as in doin the actual clicking) but I’ve introduced GDAX and Coinbase to our clients. Had some buy in Eth while it was in the low 200s, not a bad day for them now :)

A lot of companies want the technology on their backend privately, it’s really not
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:06:42
Exactly this. Drop $20 on a bank box and sleep fine at night.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:37:27
Which do? Because Ethereum was clogged down by kitties
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:30
It’s your money, close your account and move else where. I work for a private investment firm. We can not legally hold your funds unless court ordered or per Trust instructions.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:03:28
You only report earnings when you actually sell and buy.
So if you bought back in 2012 but just sold this year, you would report this year. But if you mean do you only report when you withdraw USD (or whatever currency, I’m basing this on US tax tho) from the exchange than no, you need to report when you make a sale. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:52:42
You honestly have zero idea how boxes work:
Two sets of keys: one the bank keeps and then one you keep.
Both sets are needed to open the safety deposit box. 
If you lose you keys you have to pay for the locksmith to crack the box open.
The bank has no access to the box aside from. Not to mention it’s held in the vault behind cameras and more locks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:03:20
Dude, I’m throwing more in when the price drops.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:41:49
Wonder how long he held on before selling?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:09
Yup and expensive :/
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:07:04
I work for another investment firm and we have clients and advisors talking about it the last two weeks. Some of us personally own it but most people are looking at blockchain companies as a more secure route.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:23:30
Aside from the fact that you can invest in an incredible range of products that pay dividends, are backed by actual companies, can get prefs or bonds or tax efficient securities.
A whole lot of options exist outside gambling in penny stocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:02:31
I sit at work staring at tickers and running reports for the private investment team I work for. Spend half the day watching bitcoins too. We have clients calling and asking pretty constantly about it now 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:02:19
To move $200 from Coinbase it costs $14. So yeah, the easiest method for people to purchase costs a fuck load to move to a private wallet
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:34:55
Trading volume and the traders frequent it
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:53:37
Company policy while legal is able to work with lawmakers/SEC/FINRA and find an appropriate answer to what they view as risky for investors: the thin market and volubility. It’d be too easy for a group with a few hundred million to fuck with the prices. There’s no stop protection in place like exchanges have
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:34:10
I imagine a lot of people asking these questions only have a few hundred invested. So when it costs $14 to move $200 worth of bitcoin they’re probably like “why bother” since that’s a huge chunk of their holdings.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:13:51
Across the world, which means essentially none on the large scale.

Coinbase/GDAX have blown up. Number 1 financial app on the iOS App Store And CNN/CNBC/WSJ/NYTs are constantly mentioning them. Good for them getting their shit together with all this attention on them
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:12:45
A lot of us, especially us mid-20s, in the business do understand it. A lot of the feet dragging is from compliance and legal on what’s allowed within the firm and what we can touch for the client or not
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:55:09
Y’all responded to a hypothetical situation upon which I was adding further hypothetical thought. Not sure what’s hard to grasp about that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:26:19
This is such a generic and dumb title. The stock market is made up of tons of different markets that trade a range of things all the way from Stock to Prefs to Options, Futures, etc. nice sensationalist title. Indexes are still sitting at AHs and up today again. Like come on. Everything goes up and down.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:20:43
Long vs short, yes. Day traders get taxed hard
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:27:56
It depends on the bank and state. Some escheat it in 2 to 7 years to the state. 
They only do that if you don’t respond to your mail, phone calls, any attempts to contact you whatsoever.
@_date: 2019-03-01 15:30:54
Nothing more really. Once the account is escheated it isn’t your funds in the bank anymore and is at the state until you claim it.
Seeing that Wells Fargo pays fuck all for interest rates you’ll hardly have moved.
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:16:55
Yeah, that’d be a headache to solve for everyone.
The goal is basically: don’t forget about your money and don’t ignore notices from your bank
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:10:50
Because the funds are not the banks at that point to use to make loans against or count as “assets”. It is sent to the state (my state is 5 years) where it is held until the owner is reimbursed the balance at the time of escheatment.
You can argue “why not keep it in the bank” and a good counter argument is 1) they’ll continue to charge you fees if that occurred (if you have a shit bank that does charge you fees) and 2) what if a negative interest were to develop? Now you’re stuck with this abandoned account paying the bank to hold these funds.
Then you get into tricky situations.
@_date: 2019-03-01 16:04:22
It’s counted as abandoned money if you basically drop off the face of the earth and your account gets escheated. The bank is required to attempt to contact you and document how they do so (work on the investment side so we don’t see it here but im familiar with it) and if you don’t return their calls, mail, emails, make any deposits/withdrawals, etc for those few years then it’s counted as abandoned and goes to the state.
The state holds the funds and its legally your money. It’s a process to claim but you can get it back. 
The goal is to not abandon your money though. If you ignore your bank for 2-7 years then that’s really on you as an individual.
I’m not sure what the state does with the money to be honest. They’re obviously liable if you or your estate comes to claim it.

There’s a vast difference in long term holdings and hoping for long term capital gains and essentially trading on basis point margins/day trading which someone with this set up will be doing. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:52:58
is that way
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:58:08
The majority of Apple’s business is iPhones. There’s a reason has been begging for a new Pro and Mac Mini for years. Their current versions don’t suit a lot of professionals and enthusiasts as they used to, especially with everything being soldered into the machine now. It really disappointed many people.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:19:06
I’m unbiased in this argument but they’re all over Chicago and the suburbs. You have to use the sticker
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:13:39
Uh, most stocks don’t pay an investment? Yeah, I guess if you’re only buying Large Cap stocks...I work in the industry and that’s definitely not true. Not to mention you can write options on your long positions to generate income. So even if you aren’t receiving divs you can generate income with a low risk.

This is my 9th account over the course of 8 years. What does that matter here?
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:50:47
Well a savings account is for emergency funds and short term goals (weddings, etc) where if you want to invest longterm for growth you should be in the markets
@_date: 2019-01-23 12:55:37
Have you looked around the subreddit? Bunch of neckbeard, braincel types commenting everywhere about how smart they are. No wonder

@_date: 2018-02-08 02:56:08
What if this isn’t the low and $2000 is actually it’s bottom? If you cost average in over X period you’re safer than trying to time it
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:39:14
I didn’t say it was due to volatility. I said that people forgot that the market is SUPPOSED TO BE volatile and not just a straight upwards trend. Hence the correction.
We basically said the same thing but I think you misunderstood or I wrote poorly.
Either way, it was an expected pullback by everyone in the industry.
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:28:56
ETH was that role when it was $200 back in 2017. It’s solidified its position as a good alternative to diversify a while ago
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:46:50
Equity is down because bond rates are going up...which are not listed in the DOW...
Apparently this isn’t something you understand. 
The correction in the market was something we’ve all been expecting. People seem to forget the market is supposed to be semi-volatile just because 2017 kept breaking record after record.
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:52:40
Uhhh, will you also compared it to the major indexes to show how much they grew during the same time period?
@_date: 2018-07-07 02:47:18
Or as we call it in the industry: diversification. Crazy when “hedge” is common sense diversification.
