It's trading one set of problems for another. You can argue the problems under 'bitcoin' are morally better, but to a lot of the people affected this won't matter. Is YouTube more 'fair' for showing true talent? Yes. Is letting anyone create an App more 'fair' than for the priviledged? Yes. Is Kickstarter democratizing the creative process? Yes. But in all three, as the market reaches full adoption, once again, it's only the true professionals that make it and everyone else fails. That combined with Big Data will make it pretty predictable who has any chance of improving their lives and who doesn't. What does that do to the human spirit? 
All Bitcoin does is transition the world from one led by the center to one led by intelligence. Center meaning those with the closest ties and relationships to the power elite. By nature of the world running on relationships, some people can acquire or lose the relationships etc and there are some volatility there. Once Bitcoin powers a world based on intelligence, and sheer productivity, then it's over. A lot of jobs are already being taken over my robotics. For most people, the child they might have could likely be inferior to the productivity of a robot. Hence you will only have kids if you can afford to. Just like you only buy handmade goods if you can afford to. 
So in saying this, given our biological need is to reproduce, I don't care how good technology is or how fair the world is under Bitcoin, there is a revolt coming cause now the main purpose of having kids is now obsolete due to Bitcoin powering a fully transparent, efficient economy run on machine to machine payments etc

all of them. if they didn't, there would be a coinbase for dogecoin. 
at the end of the day turnover and 1% fees are absolutely related to the market cap. 
if there are 10m coins being bought through coinbase each year at 1%, if each coin is $1 vs $1000 that's a 1000x difference. 
to pretend we can somehow stay at $600 and we can have 100x the turnover we have now is a joke. 
so back to my question. how much of this ecosystem disappears if bitcoin stays at $600. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:47:40
Is that idiotic? 
I'm saying VC backed startups will not see any growth in a situation where Bitcoin price stays at $600. Therefore the ecosystem begins to suffer from a reverse network effect. Merchants unaccepting it, startups shutting down. Job losses etc. Less people coding for free on Github contributing to the community. Less new Bitcoin millionaires being created to fund additional startups. 
All of this is to say, everyone in Bitcoin currently, are in it to see the price go into the thousands and tens of thousands. That had better play out. If not, we're al fked.

turnover is related to market cap. i'm sorry but it just is. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 10:12:28
this isn't true. it cannot be a payment network without a marketcap to support it. why don't you use dogecoin as your payment network?
For anyone to use it as a payment network, they must first use it as a store of value. I'm sorry but I'm not going to go on Coinbase and buy bitcoin for the exact amount I'm going to spend 5 seconds later on Overstock.com to save 2%. 
So the more people that use it as payment, there more there has be that have adopted it as a store of value. 
Hence price doesn't go up, Coinbase won't see enough traffic. Now if the market cap was 1trn, then sure it doesn't have to go up more for Coinbase to have increasing revenue.

fine if that's the case that means each person owns less $ value of bitcoin right? so..... tell me how you can have retail spending when 80% of people in the bitcoin community owns less than 100 dollars worth of this? 
i'm going to own 100 dollars and then spend 50 of it at overstock? silly. i'm going to own 100 dollars and then use it to gamble? i'm going to own 100 dollars and then buy on silkroad2? 
point is it seems like there are a ton of startups that are funded on the premise of 'we'll take 1% a year for storage security' or 'we'll take 1% transaction fee when they buy it'. What happens to their burn rate and viability if bitcoin stays at 600. I would love a serious explanation. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:03:42
my logic is flawed? getting paid in bitcoin precisely requires someone to buy it!
if people get paid in bitcoin, the price will for sure go up from 600. 
i think we're going to surge. but i just want to make the point that i think the ecosystem is going to shrink massively if we stay at 600 dollars for 12 months. at least 80% of the startups will not be able to raise another round of financing. the growth curve of all startups on average will be limited by the fact that the very thing they service didn't grow and stayed at x number of potential customers with y amount of 'cash' to spend at your business. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:16:15
and if you really thought it doesn't, then there is no value to owning bitcoins since this can be purely a payment network. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 22:38:33
wall street and price wouldn't surge if there's no underlying increase in turnover. 
sorry but turnover and price are related. 
hence again, what happens if we are at 600 still in 1 year.
all these startups are betting on bitcoin being massively huge in the next 12 months. going to be painful.

The world isn't that efficient right now in USD terms. The returns from education are somewhat ok for a bright kid. You could move from a poor country to the US. Any number of 'arbitrage' opportunities. 
In a more efficient world, it seems like the world would be more 'fair' in the societal order but also less movement up and down. 
Bearing children itself will become a hobby only for the rich. And from a darwinian perspective this will help the human race iterate faster, but seriously when we're biologically programmed to reproduce and half of us won't be able to afford doing so, that's going to be a problem.
How do we achieve full Bitcoin adoption without a revolution is my question. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 12:44:50
OK. Why the fk would I go through the trouble of buying bitcoin just so I can spend it immediately thereafter.
I think people only make purchases with 1-5% of their Bitcoin holdings. Therefore if you own only 100 dollars of it, you're not spending it. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 08:38:24
I'm not asking for price to drive adoption.....
I'm point to the fact that a failure to see an increase in price = no additional adoption = not enough transactions for coinbase.
(coinbase being the biggest company in the ecosystem by the way)
@_date: 2014-06-27 17:49:39
Ok fine, if the price surges for unreasonable reasons then sure the startups will survive.
Again you're not answering my question which is WHAT HAPPENS IF PRICE STAYS AT 600? WILL WE SEE MASS EXODUS AND SHUT DOWN. 
You telling me we could go to 10,000 based on fundamentals or speculation too does nothing. 
I am telling you we cannot stay at 600 and carry this amount of people employed in bitcoin.
