Where is this excess discretionary cash that the poor have left over after expenses that you are imagining?
Do you think people take out payday loans and work second jobs because they want to?  If only they had a smart Austrian economist to encourage them they will suddenly have positive cash flows?  Poor people by definition don't have material amounts of savings.   
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:47:33
Inflation didn't spike either. 
Also gains and losses aren't really what holding currency is all about. Currency is about stability. Investing is what you do with currency if you want to make gains and risk losses. 
@_date: 2014-08-24 04:31:47
Oh I fully expect crypto to be huge in the future. And maybe even dominant. Just not bitcoin. The tech is valuable but the baked in economics is pretty suboptimal. 
It will be trivial for a large company or government to adopt it with the right tweaks for mass adoption when the time is right. 
So I guess I do concede that Bitcoiners may well be changing the world. I don't think it will make you wealthy though.

When you create a community that only disseminates positive news about bitcoin and actively attempt to hide bad news and brand naysayers as trolls it certainly seems that there is only good news. This is why drops tend to take this sub by surprise.

Seeing that it affects the value of dollars it taxes those with money the most. It has almost no effect on the poor as they rely on their income week to week and by definition to not have money saved. 
I think you are confusing stagnating wages with inflation. That is a big issue for the poor and the world. Bitcoin would do nothing to help this though. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 04:34:19
So these oppressive governments will just let vendors and people accept it and let wealth leave the country and debase their own?  Same thing will happen as when they find someone using any forex illegally. It's a corruption problem not a currency one. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:29:28
That's not really a win though. You are just giving up a consumer protection for a discount. There isn't really anything structural forcing credit card companies from offering it. If the market doesn't demand it anymore that can be taken out easily. It does exist presently for a reason (read consumers don't love the idea of irreversible online transactions.)

I'm not sure this is well thought through.

And another thing that worries me. You mention not wanting to pay people who blindly review you code. 
It doesn't work like that. You have to interview research an choose people the community trusts and then pay them a fair rate. You seem to just want to throw it up there and see who comes to verify. 
You pretty much acknowledge that the system is useless. Why would you even begin to think that taking money out of the process would improve it?

That is an example of a current price after all things are considered. And the principal behind it is still valid. The price will continue to drop year over year with deflation. Starting price is irrelevant in this example and a shitty thing to argue against when there are so many other valid arguments. 
Also, deflation can not be priced in indefinitely or you will kill new house construction. because the materials and labor have to be bought at current rates, the home builder can lose money if their product is somehow sold in future deflated prices. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 20:46:42
There is no point here. Why wouldn't bitcoin eventually have payment processors as well. They work with plenty of currencies. 
I doubt the masses are going to stop demanding instant, reversible, insured, and credit limit tied transaction regardless if what currency they use. 
@_date: 2014-08-03 21:29:49
You are reducing complex concepts into black and white binary choices to easily understand it. 
That is a rarely sufficient to make decisions, especially one so large as changing how society works. 
Slavery is not working with 100% tax. Working for no money is. But so is volunteering, or staying more than you have to at work. The difference is in consent but consent isn't a concept that can easily be applied to governments. 
The state exists because it is the most powerful option after a long evolution of societies. They change incrementally over generations. Governments are not borne of consent but rather usurping less efficient models.  You can no sooner consent to your state than you can your hair color.  You can change it from within which can either lead to higher efficiency, and it's propogation, or weaken it which will eventually lead to a better style taking its place. You can of course refuse to consent but that state can also deal with those people by whatever means makes it most powerful. That is the human condition. Not an option for you. 
You may point to revolution as a counter point to this but even then the victors move to quickly replace the state with one they seem better. They always choose to tax because it needs resources to maintain power over competing, inferior systems. 
The tax-less state doesn't exist not because it hasn't been tried but because It has failed and cannot compete with modern governments. 
And another point is enforcement. Your right to own land is granted by society. If your society has no funds to enforce this, what if a competing society decides that the land is there's and does indeed have the resources to enforce this. Suppose they further decide that you are subject to their laws and have the resources to enforce that as well. That is the underlying reason why you cannot live in an unfunded society.

@_date: 2014-07-04 18:36:35
I mainly made this offer to highlight the fact that you are selling me a bond with a 15% annual return. Obviously my profit is locked in as long as I hedge and buy the bitcoin immediately. And assuming that you pay of course. 
I want to do it as well, as my retirement accounts make nothing near that. The problem I face though is that I have a pretty high risk in this transaction.  If we proceed with the arrangement, I would be seeking collateral and a risk assessment involving a credit score/pay stubs/bank statements. I would also have the hassle of getting licensed in your state. I doubt this is worth it to either of us for such a small sum though. 
Honestly you would have to be in pretty stellar financial shape to make this loan worth it in terms of risk and if that's the case you probably have the cash to hold as much as you want to speculate with anyways. 
And it's really not a good deal for you. You would need to either see a 700ish% rise in value to see a profit factoring in usd inflation. (Not including using that capital to make more money, but you're not going to see that many good investing opportunities denominated in bitcoin.). You can spend a fraction of the eventual price and still make a ton but with a much lower downside. 
Sorry if I mislead you as the offer is not practical for me upon further consideration.

That is a pretty unsophisticated view of the role of current payment systems. For one reversible payments also cover the purchaser from delinquent merchants. People charge back when something is t delivered as promised or fraudulent. This will not become an obsolete problem. 
That bitcoin box consumer product your are imagining?  It will never happen. People want to store money in guaranteed and professionally secured institutions and they always will. It doesn't matter how secure your box is, if you can personally open it someone is going to beat you with a baseball bat until you cough up the things needed to unlock it. That's just how the world works. Large amounts of money are always going to need armed personnel and regulation to keep it secure. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:43:51
I did read it. I think its a bit ridiculous to expect someone to do a thorough enough job to both confirm there are no bugs/malicious code plus that the binary matches the released code. 
There are a lot of less than honest/knowledgable/people out there with nothing to lose by doing a half assed job an that's exactly what you will get. 
The quality and trust in your projects are an investment. You need to spend money on it just like any other aspect of your business. It would be no less ridiculous to ask the public to take turns doing security patrols outside of your office rather than paying to properly secure your assets.
This is not a joke in the literal sense but you are showing the public how much their trust is worth to you in real terms. In this case it is precisely 0.

That would be not doing business with them in the future and selling remaining pieces of your stake in the company to try and recoup profits. 
For criminal punishment to apply there has to be regulations on business (clear laws of how to run a business)
An unregulated market lacks these laws an simply failing at business is not a crime thus no applicable punishment. 
Those of you pushing for no regulation and criminal charges here basically are asking to reinstate debtor prisons and make business failure a criminal offense. Pretty dumb...

Yes indeed. But my original point was that the bitcoin community reinvented banks for themselves so that has been covered already I think. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:55:41
That's not their goal. That is just an unfortunate byproduct of them selling their holdings at a higher price than they expect bitcoin to be at in the coming weeks. 
Say you knew a big bitcoin service would go bankrupt by next week and the news would likely send the price down $100. You could sell now and even if your large sell would crash the market down $100 you still make money because most of your coins would be sold higher than the expected price. 
It's basically free money.

@_date: 2014-03-30 16:57:06
Yeah. The effect will be longer term. Less people will decide to make capital investments in mining but this will be felt months out. 
Currently if you bought a miner it's a done deal. It may not be profitable in total but it is still 'profitable' to run as it is the difference of making 70% of your investment rather than a smaller fraction of your investment if you were to shut down or sell it. 
Just stopping would be like not going to work because your expenses unexpectedly rose. You might be losing money in total but you still need that salary regardless to Lessen the impact.

You as in the holder of bitcoin, not the creators. They did create value. You are not. 
And it absolutely is a wealth transfer. The prominent idea here is that bitcoin will gain dominance and that will cause the precipitous decline of fiat currency and the rush to change into bitcoin will make you the next oil baron. That is effectively a wealth transfer from those holding traditional currencies to those holding bitcoin.
Bitcoin is open source. It can be remade and modified by anyone. Society has no interest in adopting a coin that transfers wealth away from themselves to you. It would be trivially easy to adopt one that keeps the same technological advantages and being able to retain their savings. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:38:08

What?!  How is giving a loan denominated in btc reducing exposure to btc volatility?  You are still getting btc back and that is still subject to the volatility. If you buy gold or another currency and lend/hold that then sure. 
But what you just said is flat out wrong. I don't really understand who could be up voting this. 
Edit:  in actuality you are even more exposed to volatility if you make loans since you aren't liquid. You have no ability to use that money to hedge or leave the market if a downturn is expected where you can if you hold your btc.

Too much here to properly criticize, but you appear to be over your head and I implore you to take a good look at your investments after studying what risk actually is. 
It is clearly not what you think it is and the way you calculate it is quite dangerous. You are completely discounting the downsides of risk and treating all risk as equal. There are also reasons that rich people diversify investments and a large part of their wealth management strategy is controlling for these risks, even if they are sure about them. 
Another thing: People don't get wealthy sitting on their ass but that is what you fully intend to do by switching currencies. You have to carefully consider your own advice here. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:41:59
That's simply not true. Inflation is one of the biggest factors an an economy's wage levels. It's literally the only driving force in many cases. They tend to lag slightly sometimes but I really can't make any arguments if you refuse to even recognize that basic fact.  
If you need proof, compare wages to 20 years ago. Why do you suppose people are payed so much more now?  Corporate generosity perhaps?

You're right. It truly is simple to figure out. 
Banks sell bank accounts, they have currency. People redeem checks for currency.
As long as **1.** not everyone redeems their currency at once, and **2.** other investing revenues are made, the company will be more than solvent.
When you factor in the fact that most people spend more on banking services, and many people leave balances unused in their accounts, that 10% worth of fractional reserve goes a *long* way.  
It is always entertaining when people in this sub develop banking practices independently when at first they rail against them as fraudulent and obsolete. 
I know we don't see eye to eye, but I feel that I won this argument fair and square. Can you give me that at least?
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:01:05

If it's theirs what is the point of opting in as you can be subject to other justice systems anyways.

1. It allows employers to keep wages low and obscures the true market rate for labor to those they employ. 
2. Tax cheats can move money around to skirt paying which causes honest people to pay more. 
5.  People take money from government programs or charities/well meaning friends besides having considerable assets and clearly do not qualify under the spirit of the law. 
6. Companies and governments can obscure true costs to hide profit margins or improper spending which hurts average consumers or taxpayers. 
Bitcoins public ledger actually could improve this. 
But I ask what does financial privacy benefit people besides in cases when they are trying to misrepresent themselves?  (Honest question as I am trying to understand this concept better). 
I can think of less exposure to targeted advertising and analysis of behaviors that can be used to manipulate you. Any others?

It's pretty hilarious that people here think that holding bitcoin has a legit chance to be oil baron wealthy. 
You aren't producing any real value and I can guarantee that society will give you a bullet before a transfer of such wealth to you. 
If the tech succeeds then it will be remade beginning as a pegged currency to allow previously earned wealth to be preserved. There is literally no chance it transfers to bitcoin adopters.

Keep in mind that the auction was broken into lots. It is entirely possible that one groups winning bid was significantly higher than the rest but they only got 1 lot. 
It's pretty easy to have an at market or above market 'winning bid' but have the majority of coins bought well below that. 
To find the true distribution multiple groups will have to disclose their bids and what was remaining for them to purchase.

The general public will never be technically able to or even accept the responsibility to secure their wealth personally. 
Fortunately this creates a great opportunity for people with a great understanding of BTC to handle this aspect for them. A secure facility can store a users bitcoin in an electronic and physical vault and give them access through the ability to make withdrawals and deposits. 
Unfortunately a secure vault of this scale isnt cheap and adopters will be wary of paying fees to hold their money, but there are solutions. Bitcoin vault operators can make low risk investments and loans with the coin in the vaults to fund the enterprise and even share the gains with depositors. 
Of course this generates the risk of losses for the bitcoin vault depositors so multiple vaults may develop a system to pool risk and insure each other from losses with bitcoin default swaps.
This would not be complete though and the bitcoin foundation will likely have to license official bitcoin vaults who maintain specified BTC storage practices including including set bitcoin to loan ratios. They can then insure deposits for bitcoin accounts up to a certain amount to boost public confidence and increase adoption. 
With a new customer base bitcoin vaults will then be able to innovate more consumer friendly services to attract customers and provide value to the BTC community. They can issue secure and insured cards for purchases denominated in BTC and even allow for an 'overspending' protection allowing their customers to use their cards even if they accidentally run out of funds. (For a small fee of course). 
With the majority of btc customers participating in the bitcoin vault ecosystem they will be able to quickly and efficiently forge partnership with regulators and law enforcement to identify btc used for illicit purposes. This will further legitimize the currency in the eyes of the public an allow it to truly flourish with little government interference. 
This is a very real challenge but free market entrepreneurship like that outlined above will allow BTC to gain mass adoption. 
Bitcoin will change everything. .

Societies evolve the same as many things do do. States with a strong government literally killed off decentralized and weaker states. If a stronger alternative existed it would kill off the nation state in short order. 
Bitcoin is not a stronger alternative.

Losers will be losers regardless of their currency.  I think that even if bitcoin makes it a lot of people here will find that it wasn't the dollar keeping them down and that their own dumbassery is the thing holding them back all along. Instead of dealing with that I fully expect them to jump into a new super anonymous alt coin instead.

Everyone with a mortgage or student debt is actually hedged pretty well against that. Most people are pretty financially neutral to bitcoin adoption. 
That being said, bitcoins ability to devalue fiat currency is pretty suspect.

Ah, get rich quick dreams built on the financial devastation of friends and family. 
Fortunately for them, Bitcoin making you rich is not a foregone conclusion. In fact, it is much more likely that the technology will change the world than this specific coin. 
It will be a boring slide of modified distributed ledger technology replacing some legacy systems. The amount of wealth transfer will be minimal. 
And a financial crisis will not put anyone in the mood to dabble in new types of assets. Didn't happen in Cyprus, didn't happen in Ukraine or Argentina or Venezuela or Zimbabwe either.

You completely misinterpreted what I wrote. My point is that the company doesn't have the cash to cover its current liabilities, not that gift cards make up all of the liabilities. 
And the risk you take as a creditor is not that amazon can't collect on its debt, it's that it becomes insolvent. 
I have clearly proved that their gift cards are in no way backed by assets and are instead backed on the faith that the risk of insolvent is low. 
Of course that risk is low!  That was never the point of this argument.

@_date: 2014-02-02 18:57:19
That's not true at all. 
First of all, financial markets operate in very different regulatory environments. 
China may have more strict regulations than what is acceptable to bitcoin. Another alt coin can design their protocol to be compliant to gain that market. (Or several coins). 
Regulation may also be voluntary and made by companies if a market prefers certain assurances/features and backing. Some segments of the market may gravitate to highly regulated currencies above and beyond what it required by law to reduce exposure to volatility. 
Others will want to eschew some security in favor of transaction speed and usability. 
Others will opt for less liquidity and security to use it as a store of value. 
There is no advantage to having a one size fits all currency when it is relatively easy to have many viable alternatives. Thinking that one will dominate such an unexploited market is unwise in my opinion. 
Bitcoin is the start but it's far from perfect and the barriers to entry have never been lower  (as shown by the rise of a hastily thrown together currency featuring a dog) 
It's really a cool thing for the world. A few of you all will be let down that you will probably not be a billionaire, but this way is better. 
And to be honest we don't really need another generation of ultra wealthy people riding to coattails of speculative investments they or their families made years ago with little or no contribution to society apart from that. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:57:32
Modern companies don't typically keep an unnecessarily large balance of straight cash or inventory. Your money likely went into the companies operations budget, investments or to shareholders. The promise that they will remain solvent is the only value it holds. 
It's exactly like a bank except their operations happen to be financial services. On top of that it's actually insured so probably even less of a fraud in your view.

Deposits are not investments and interest in no way reflects your chance to lose your investment. That is a fundamental misunderstanding of the banking system. 
Interest is a payment in exchange for your liquidity (most banks offer different interest rates depending in held balances and withdrawal restrictions if you want an example of this.)
If interest represented your chance of losses we would see bank deposits lost at a rate of about 1% worldwide. That is a staggering number and it simply isn't happening. 
Edit: Other services banks offer is deposit insurance, insured and secured vaults, 24x7 fraud monitoring and support, tax document distribution, financial advising and other things depending on the bank. 
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:45:24
Yeah. But if India or China makes laws requiring electronic currencies to transmit names of participants and dates for transactions there is no way that is making it into some coins but a coin that somehow satisfies this would have a lucrative market all to itself.  Exchanges and other companies will adopt it too as they don't want to miss such a large market. 
That scenario right there would take a huge percentage out of bitcoins potential market share. 
Furthermore technology will further make coins more specialized. Some will be more secure. Some will have faster transactions. Some may even be backed by commodities, shares in companies or fiat.  One currency wouldn't necessarily be good at one thing but not the others. 
And this would be so great for consumers and drive innovation.

This is wrong. Btc is global but growth is never uniform. If the world gdp grows 10% it will be mostly from emerging markets. A 10% loan would be untenable for people living in areas experiencing a 2% growth rate. 
In your example that is not a nominal rate for the consumer. Nominal rates price in inflation/deflation. If deflation is tied to gdp growth as in your example, an 11% real rate with 10% deflation would make the nominal rate 21% as they are paying 11% interest and having to pay that in currency worth 10% more than what it was.
Also you said that house prices are stable so mortgages will have a lower rate, but homes would also deflate.

Because if you are shorting the market while you hold long positions you are hedging rather than optimizing your position. If you wanted to short, you can sell first and use that money to hold a bigger position anyways. 
It's shorting and holding is like insurance. Except you don't need the asset to ensure it.
To illustrate, if you knew for a fact that your car will be destroyed by a meteorite tomorrow you could A. Sell it for market value B. Insure it and collect market value after the event or C. Sell for market value and get the insurance payment after the event. 
B is the worst option here and that is essentially what shorting your own held asset is. It might be a good idea though if your insider information is not too reliable I suppose though
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:10:02
A lot of people will be taking larger positions than they are comfortable with in the short term to take advantage of what they see as an artificially low price. They will have to sell as soon as possible to lower their risk exposure. I'm sure there are some who bought to hold but a big chunk of people have bought as a short term arbitrage opportunity.

How many bitcoins do you hold and what is your total net worth?
@_date: 2014-07-05 16:24:05
Ok. Have more time to expand on this. 
I don't think mortgages work well with a deflationary currency for a few reasons. The most obvious is that it will be expensive. Of course you can add a few percent over the deflation rate and call it a day but the system will start running into problems. 
There is a floor to where it is more profitable to hold cash than to lend it. The baseline is 0 and then you have to account for administration costs and risk. this typically accounts for a few percent, but in a deflationary currency risk would have to be recalculated. The underlying asset (homes) would deflate in terms of bitcoin price (along with everything else in the economy) so lenders would be much less likely to be able to recoup their investment by simply foreclosing. Wages would also deflate so the persons ability to pay would also be less likely which would be factored in as well. 
From the lenders perspective the loan gets worse as time goes by (less valuable asset and higher % of a persons income for the payment). This will translate into a higher premium to make it worth it and this higher premium will both increase the risk of buyers defaulting and provide significantly less incentive (demand) for buyers*. 
Another problem is that mortgages act as a short position on the dollar. It's not really a feature of the loan but it benefits buyers greatly and diversified their risk. It would act in the same way in bitcoin but now the buyers are essentially shorting a deflationary currency which is obviously not desirable. Deflation now hits a debtor twice. Once in their wages and the second time against the value of their financed assets. If you are wealthy this is fine because your cash and investing holdings gain in value, but for the young and middle class the cost of owning property just got higher. *
This is already too long but I think this will cause home prices to fall further as financing becomes more expensive. It will be great for those with lots of capital and a living hell for those without. Bitcoin is probably one of the most aristocracy friendly systems I could imagine. The tech could make a great system someday and is probably already good enough as a remittance and international trade medium. As a currency though it would benefit the rich and early adopters greatly but hurt the rest. Lower fees would not begin to make up for that IMO. 
* these decreases in demand will push rates lower but the minimum rate needed for profitability will also limit supply past a certain point. The equilibrium point is probably much lower than it is today. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:28:46
Right but bitcoin isn't superior for transactions or banking. It is pretty clearly an international remittance and currency exchange for business to business transfers though which is where it's likely to see some growth. 
Banks haven't done much if anything at all to stop bitcoin. It's not even capable if taking over even with their explicit support

Credit cards aren't popular due to the currency behind it. They are popular because they provide a credit line, complete fraud insurance and rewards. 
Bitcoin does not. Credit cards could become denominated in bitcoin but convincing a shop owner to take btc is about the same as them taking cash. It's great and less fees but the public probably won't be bothered so they will continue accepting most of their sales on cards. 
I don't see why so many people in this sub don't see the disconnect between a currency and payment processors. Did the euro replace credit cards in Europe when it came out?  No because credit cards simply used the euro too. 
Bitcoin won't replace credit cards either because the market hasn't fundamentally changed. People still prefer their services regardless of what currency they use. And merchants accept payments methods that their customers use. Not the other way around.

If you view bitcoin as owning shares in the world economy that means that you are entitled to a share of all future world productivity. If you own shares in Apple you own a share of all of apples future productivity.

This is touching on why bitcoin is fundamentally flawed if it were to be used as a currency. 
A home or business loan would be ridiculously expensive. 
First it would have to offer a return above and beyond the deflation rate to make investors even think about making the loan. 
Second, because of deflation, the home or capital good will continuously lose btc value. If you buy a home for 100k bitcoin it will be worth less an less each year. This poses a risk for lenders and will cause interest rates and payment schedules to increase. 
Third, wages, like all else in bitcoin economy will also deflate. That means that loan payments will take a larger and larger portion of your salary or income to make payments and create even more default risk. This also translates into higher rates. 
And remember to think of it from a lenders perspective, why loan money out that is already making a 0 risk return for a depreciating asset to someone making less and less income each year?  It would have to be a pretty high rate of return...  
I believe at this point bitcoin has value as a payment processing network but not as a standalone currency. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:17:39
That is dumb. Third world countries are mostly plagued by poverty which by definition means they don't have savings to destroy with inflation.

May I ask how much that was?  It's pretty relevant if you are giving financial advice. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:29:22
I think you are mischaracterizing consumer motivations and trust here. Bitcoin payments require much more trust that a merchant will provide the good or service advertised or at least return funds if not. Consumers in today's markets have much more trust in their card issuers than they do for their individual merchants. 
Fraud insurance, credit lines and instant approvals are all things consumers demand and that is not possible with bitcoin transactions. A payment service denominated in bitcoin is surely possible, but transacting on the blockchain isn't a very attractive solution for electronic payments for the mass market yet. 
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:49:54
That's not how it works at all. Gift cards are not revenues and when they are bought they list it as a liability. You become a creditor of the company. An unsecured creditor at that. 
Let's take amazon as an example (all 2013 data). They don't even carry enough cash to cover their accounts payable (15bn) let alone all current liabilities. 
To highlight my point, amazon holds 8.6 billion in cash and equivalents and another 7.4 billion in inventories. (2013). Their inventory turnover ratio is about 8.1 meaning an average inventory item takes about 45 days to move. This is a bit muddied as they provide services too but they do break down product sales numbers. You can see that their yearly sales are 60 billion in products alone and average inventories are 6700ish. They carry a little over a months worth of inventory. 
Amazon has over 30 billion in liabilities, and gift card holders are pretty low on this list. To suggest that the cards are backed by much more than faith in the company is a bit disingenuous. 
You can check the SEC's EDGAR system to confirm if you wish. (Another obsolete service provided by the statist oppressors)

Dogecoin is obviously not going to be *the* major currency. But it and lite coin an several others have proven there won't be one major crypto currency. There is no reason for there to be only one and there will likely be several competing coins. None will be big enough to take over. Bitcoin may be a major player but it might not. 
Competition is good.  Some can have higher regulation, some can have less. Some will have better features than other for different markets and economies.  Consumer choice will benefit everyone and drive monetary innovation. The entire idea of a global standard is probably untenable. 
It's probably not what the bitcoin 1%ers in waiting want to hear but the real lasting benefit of all this is the tech, not the value in the coins. The same things that let bitcoin flourish now will allow better and more specialized protocols gain prominence over it as well.

Trading is a value added wealth creating service. Holding a particular currency is not. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 16:50:11
That's not even the main reason. Deflation disincentivizes investment because wealth at rest is no longer a liability. 
This means that world wealth creation is shared amongst all currency holders rather than those that make that newfound wealth. (This magical free money that is created for holders that grows as the economy grows doesn't actually come from nowhere) 
Basically the wealthy have their hand in the cookie jar without having to take a risk. This enriches the rich at the expense of innovators.  More importantly it keeps money away from successful businesses and gives it to a portion of the population that contributes almost nothing.

No I mean businesses paying salaries in bitcoin. 
It only helps the wealthy because CPI increased 60% last year. No middle or lower class can save a dime when it takes a days wage to buy dinner. 
So the wage earners have no savings and spend their whole check. Changing their money to bitcoins won't do anything. They don't care as much about inflation aside from the fact that their wages don't keep up with it. It's not that their savings are devalued like idiots here try to argue. They do t have savings.

Financial illiteracy, even if eloquent, is still financial illiteracy. 
You don't deserve a cut of the worlds financial growth simply for holding money. That is incentive and property of those that created that wealth. Sharing with the rest of the world that is wealthy enough to save money is inefficient and does not help with innovation or anything else at all. 
You are not making a 'loan' as you said earlier by holding currency an deflation is your 'interest.'  Society did not ask for the loan, it is possibly not needed, and of course in any case of a loan, who actually pays the interest to you?  I suppose you expect those who actually take risk and innovate with their money. Do you really want a system that punishes that and rewards hoarding for almost no value?
An extra chair does not cheapen all chairs, excess supply or decreased demand does. Again, you are not entitled to the savings there either, those that want the chairs are because that is their incentive to buy a chair and that is a central tenet of a market economy. That is not your cookie jar to siphon money from. 
The crux of the matter is that a deflationary currency is great for the wealthy and the elderly. Young and working class people without income sufficient for savings will find themselves making less and less while the wealth gap continues to increase. 
Look, I get it, you an most others here want this thing to change the world and make you incredibly wealthy at the same time but that doesn't mean you can just overlook all the weaknesses of it. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:57:15
Kind of but my point is that it's a benefit for consumers and a big reason they are successful. 
Here bitcoin land chargeback is a dirty word but it's a major feature. It just shows that a lot of the bitcoin world is tone deaf when it comes to making a product people want to use. Consumers don't want to be responsible for data losses or insecure systems whether it's their fault or not. They don't even want to have to think about it. 
And no, it's not because people are stupid. It's because they value their time and demand that feature. That demand is greater than what bitcoin would eventually save them. 
But saying that bitcoin doesn't have chargebacks to a potential consumerlike it is a selling point is like a car company telling a family that their minivan is better because it comes without seatbelts.

It's so painful to repeat over and over again but inflation is not the underlying problem in these countries. It is a relatively tiny symptom of much larger problems. 
Poverty has much more to do with wages, corruption and access to affordable goods. Inflation really only hurts people with savings. An impoverished unbanked person by definition is probably one of the least affected people by inflation in the world. Those who are in debt even more so. 
Bitcoin supporters really really need to learn this. Bitcoin will make capital flight and savings go up for upper classes but it will be at a cost of local investment and won't make a dent in the economic misery.

@_date: 2014-02-24 16:04:59
You can. You just have to account for it so it can't be laundered.  Probably not free in your view, but traveling with any amount of legally made money is in fact legal. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 05:14:18
Please don't send any money. This is a scam and OP can't even say what it will go towards. 
Also capital flight is not really going to solve any problems in the country. It's more of a wage and runaway crime/corruption problem. Inflation is a symptom but solving that isn't even close to what is needed. 
There is a booming black market for currency if people want that. Bitcoin would be a second tier option for them and much harder to convert to everyday needs. 
The real problems there stem from low buying power due to depressed wages and high inflation. Unless you somehow get businesses to pay in bitcoin and at higher salaries this won't do jack for normal people. 
Realistically this only helps the upper class keep their wealth. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:05:10
Lots of money has been clawed back and investors will likely see a good chunk of principle returned. On top of that the proprietors have been held legally accountable. None if that is on the table with unregulated exchanges.

This is beyond stupid. Inflation is a symptom not a problem. It's like prescribing a cold shower to cure a fever. Like a fever inflation is actually a help to economies in some situations bitcoin will do fuck all to fix problems in those country's economies. It will only help the wealthy and those who are leaving the country.

I like to reel in overzealous Bitcoiners as much as the next guy, but you have to admit its pretty good exposure for the money. They happened to get some larger market teams and had bitcoin plastered over everything. To get that type of repetition in commercials in front of that many people by buying just commercial time slots it would have cost a ton more. 
It's not going to make bitcoin suddenly mass adopted but seems like a good value for awareness.

Bitcoin + off chain companies cannot handle the number of transactions to even see if its superior. I don't understand how you could make that statement. Also for small transactions, the most common type by far, now the fee isn't even smaller. Being superior for large, cross border transactions is good, but it's a niche.

Well more for the other conference posts than this one but yeah. 
I think you are probably a good guy and very pragmatic in getting things done like the bitcoin conference. So obviously working to get to the bottom of this is something you are interested in doing. 
By giving the GAW guys a chance and publicly moderating the issue like it seems you're doing here, however, can look like you are giving them another chance to victimize others and dragging your feet on the real issue that many feel has already been proven. 
It's not that you are doing the wrong thing, but there are a lot of people in this community who absolutely would do the wrong thing here for money. It's just not a good look and can easily backfire on you. 
For what it's worth I doubt you are trying to support scammers, but I vehemently recommend you do not make yourself the public face of this issue.

Sort answer:  probably not. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:16:53
I think this community thinks using the blockchain means no tokens at all. I don't think anyone actually plans that, but instead wants to not use Bitcoin as their token. For that there are lots of reasons. 
Different block sizes and confirmation times to suit that country or organizations needs. 
Ability to limit mining to trusted entities to eliminate foreign intervention or 51% attacks. 
Reversible transactions to attract doubtful customers. 
Ability to comply with local regulations recharging asset freezes and identity issues. 
Use of multiple ledgers to allow for variance in functionality across regions/business types. 
The ability to back the currency with a tangible asset. 
People don't have to give up massive amounts of resources to early Bitcoin adopters. 
There is a huge incentive to use a new coin for a company or currency. I believe it to be inevitable. 
Please note that these are possible reasons that some organizations would opt to not use Bitcoin. I fully understand that you personally may not see it as a benefit in your own world view.

A. They do not have access to updated and secure devices to properly use bitcoin. 
B. They and their beneficiaries do not have nearby vendors who accept bitcoin. (At least without usurious fees)
C. Currency volatility is much more harmful to those with low incomes relative to spending needs. 
D. Bitcoin is unusable in remote, undeveloped areas where they and their beneficiaries are sometimes located. 
E. "Offchain" solutions do not mitigate all drawbacks and introduce more fees to the workers. 
F. Mistakes in sending or receiving bitcoin may can cause hardship.

Governments evolve, just like living things. 
The reason they are the way they are today is that the modern state was able to best defend itself. (Effectively taxing citizens is an aspect of this). 
If states were to somehow lose their ability to fund a military, a society that either could still fund it's military or people would have a great advantage over their neighbors. 
Human nature and history shows is that they will use that to take their neighbors resources and increase their power and funding further and repeat. 
Other nations will also be pushed to either use their model of heavy taxes for defense to survive or ultimately be superseded by more militaristic societies. 
Bitcoin can't stop this. The problem was never that people couldn't keep their money from a government. It's that a weak government, for all the freedom it may provide is quickly usurped by more powerful forces.

Can someone explain to me why the bitcoin part of the tech is needed or even wanted? A centralized mining authority would have the advantages of lower block times, no chance of a 51% attack, even lower fees than bitcoin, and much less electricity waste. And society at large doesn't have the expense of making early adopters rich. 
The trade off is trusting a single or several institutions. That doesn't really seem to be a problem with the vast majority of consumers. They would probably lose the bitcoin as a store of value and be your own trust less bank crowd but that market is tiny. And honestly tey would probably end up using USDCoin or EUROCoin anyways.

Garnishment is always taken from one organization and given to another per court order. You can move the goalposts to not include this. 
Your employer will garnish your wages in btc just as easily as usd. Same for a bank it coinbase or circle or whatever. 
Money you hold personally has never been subject to garnishment, be it in dollars or bitcoin.

This is one of the saddest threadsi have seen in a while. Bitcoin is pretty cool and has a chance to make it. At 200 a coin it reflects that there is a vanishingly small chance to be very very valuable. But it is small. Going long on btc should be seen more as a fun lottery ticket than an investment. (Or maybe more accurately as a hobby for some. ).

This entire conversation is macro related in my opinion. 
Also saving is investing in the current system unless you hold cash. The proposed system is deflationary and rewards sitting on cash in a literal sense. Quite the difference in my opinion.

No I am saying incentive for risk taking drives innovation and grows economies better long term. 
Deflationary policies or currencies reduce that incentive with the added bonus of actively discouraging investment in all but the most obvious ventures. It prices the young and those that have lost their money on risks/previous stupidity out of larger capital expenses that would create economic opportunity. All of that just to benefit a few entrenched rich people an early adopters. 
You don't own your money. You are given a varying amount of societies resources to allocate as a reward for the relative value of your work. This is essentially what money represents. Spend it wisely(invest and see it grow). Spend it poorly (luxuries, consumer foods etc) and see it shrink.  Do nothing an see it shrink more slowly so that society's wealth can be put into more capable an confident hands.

Short answer no. 
Long answer:  their biggest problem is instability corruption and a power vacuum. All of these things make business, wealth building and productivity ob a large scale impossible. Inflation is so low on the list of priorities that bitcoin would have no effect.
Lack of infrastructure and unstable and corrupt government is the root cause and that is how it must be fixed. There is nothing of great monetary value being created there.  It doesn't matter if payments are in fiat bitcoins or gold bullion. No one would get enough anyways. 
And for more of a reason, even if a charitable bitcoin amount was given the infrastructure and local retail shops prevent its use. Only the rich could have a chance to use them. The rest would trade it to the rich for a pittance of its true value. It would likely fund the same corrupt people that oppress them. 
If you want real change, support NGOs that provide incentives for stability there. If you want to help individuals give them USD. If you want to promote bitcoin do it in a place you have a greater understanding about.

I'm afraid it doesn't to me. I don't understand how resting money as opposed to active money is better for an economy. Isn't that a disincentive to risk taking?  Ie rich people giving their inherited or accumulated wealth to those smarter or more driven than they?  
I get it from an individual standpoint but there seems to be no substance on a macro economic scale.

Now you are thinking in the right direction. Crypto currency is in its infancy and what are the odds that people got it right the first time. 
I don't think people appreciate the tiny odds bitcoin has of making it in the long term. It is of course a very large payoff if it does but lets be honest. If the chances of that are approaching even 1% the price of btc would be much much higher. If it were close to 10% it would be trading in the tens of thousands of dollars range. 
Don't get me wrong. Being a true believer on a development side is a great thing. A true believer as a passive investor though is about one if the dumbest things you can do. 
Don't kid yourself. No one earns billions of dollars without working their ass off and putting everything on the line multiple times. You won't either.

The fact that you have to answer this with a question should give you pause. The point of bitcoin was and will always be to be a low transaction cost currency. 
Your card is novel but furthers none if what bitcoin is designed to be. If it isn't successful with fiat it will not be with bitcoin either. 
You are going after the average joe in terms of ease of use but rolling out a card full of blue tooth and phone app features that they will most assuredly be averse to setting up. You are simultaneously trying to capitalize on early adopting tech users but this market is savvy enough to get similar services cheaper. 
I would recommend you solidify who your want to market to and focus on giving them the absolute best experience possible before moving forward. Your current implementation will likely fail in my opinion.

No, most companies have a on call support team with the tools they need handle things. If most inquiries or support requests require multiple contact points to solve then it is a serious problem in the company structure. Either the organization does not give support staff enough authority to act on anything or it failed to plan and create the tools, databases and procedures needed to get it done. 
That is what has happened here. 
A good company can solve the vast majority of requests without consultation from other departments, and the more complicated ones at least get a courtesy email informing them of the delay.

Won't this just cause a credit crunch. If you earn money on liquid cash any loan would have to earn more interest than that plus a premium for the risk of default, admin costs and inconvenience of being illiquid. 
How would young people buy a house or a car without saving for decades?  
And with that property owners and those already rich people would have considerable power and wealth just by extension of having money. There is no reason to lend it out as they get richer by simply not spending. 
I can see why early adopters are eager for this as they would be the main benefactors but it seems terribly oppressive and keeps money out of the hands of would be innovators.

Because obviously if even 1% of transactions were in btc the demand would cause the price to be actually to the moon.  Most btc price fluctuations are not correlated at all to demand and actual use of btc. For instance silkroad closing didn't even slow it down for a week. 
There aren't really products or services currently that are more cost effective or easier to get with bitcoin than fiat right now but many people are speculating so that would indicate that the value of bitcoin is highly correlated with what it might be in the future. (Ie the to the moon types)  I think there are a lot of people who are going to be screwed when they realize too late that the people telling them to hold are the ones profiting from that. 
I think crypto currency is awesome but I doubt that bitcoin specifically will have more than a % chance to the the one to actually take over. 
But even at 1% chance you'd be a fool not to own a few just to see if it can.

Most big ticket items are bought with financing which would become more expensive if deflation happened. Sales would go way down compared to now.

So you have the right to earn money simply by virtue of holding it. You know that comes at others expense right?  
Money is useful to society to grow it. Wealth isn't a status you achieve. It is a lifelong process with investment decisions, innovation, luck, or all three.  Anything else and we would be mired down in backwards oligarchies and rules by the most inbred and incapable people imaginable.

I feel that if you use less buzz words and provided more analysis you might be able to make a better case.

Actually you are ignoring bankroll management and making a terrible investment analogy. Professional poker players only bring a small % of their available bankroll to the table for one game. They may bet it all in one hand but they are very diversified. 
This isn't because they are afraid to bet their money for a good hand. It is because they understand math. Variance and risk of ruin are why we diversify.  Not because of fear. 
I suggest you read up before investing or playing poker for that matter.
