Bitcoins production price is high because of the price of Bitcoin which is a product of its demand in relation to its supply. However, a miner is unlikely to sell at a loss so a decreased Bitcoin price is likely to cause the miner to hold the bitcoin rather than selling it, thereby limiting the supply even further. The price of production is in direct relation to the price of the token. Both prices influence each other.

Good luck with that!

Thank you for taking your time to read my article! Here's an example of what I mean: The painting "Salvator Mundi" by Leonardo da Vinci is worth about 450 million dollars today. Why? Because it's scarce. Would it be expensive to transact with it? Yes. But it doesn't matter. Scarcity is what gives bitcoin its value.

On the computer example: The first computer ever made was arguably Turing's original enigma machine. It would be invaluable if it still existed today. The best one is arguably the bitcoin network. It's worth 43,137,762,206 US dollars.

Irony doesn't play well with the internet sometimes. Sorry if you didn't like the article, it wasn't meant to be taken literally. Bitcoin's doing just fine btw, hovering just above 2700.

You've got a point there for sure. But what I say in the article is "Even in the unlikely event that another cryptocurrency should become the dominant one bitcoin will always be the first - bitcoin will always be valuable." I'm not saying it will be the most valuable one, just that it always will have some value because it came first. This is not true for any of the other ones.
