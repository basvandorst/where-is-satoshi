Ok thanks... so as far as I can tell submitting your own sites is fine, so long as that's not all you submit? I'll keep that in mind for future.

Let's be clear - we're talking about the fact that TitsForBitcoin.com is not the "first and only" Bitcoin cam site as you claim. And in fact, it is a blatant copy of LiveBitcoinCams.com. 
Anyone can clearly see that BoobsForBitcoin.com (an older site with less functionality) looks nothing like either of them. There's no slander here, we're just talking about the facts.
Let's look at the Whois information:

It wasn't intended to come across as spam. We held off from posting self-promotional stuff on Reddit before, but since TitsForBitcoin decided to go public with a claim of being "the first and only", we felt it was a good idea to share the true story here.

Regardless of what you copied, it's neither the "first" or the "only" Bitcoin cam site, so your title is incorrect.
Here's what happened with the three sites: BoobsForBitcoin launched first, with a very primitive single chat room. A few days later, LiveBitcoinCams ran a demo using the same third party technology (from Influxis) as BoobsForBitcoin - but with all our own content. We found that technology lacking though, and switched to a different script which is what you see today. LiveBitcoinCams was the first site of its kind, having an integrated payment system, tips and private chat - all based entirely on Bitcoin.
Then just a few days ago, TitsForBitcoin launched. This site hardly resembles your earlier site BoobsForBitcoin at all. That's because it is a complete copy of all the technology and content from LiveBitcoinCams. For screenshots and Whois info, see the comment [here](

Good point. It's great to see more sites entering the field, but of course that's no reason for TitsForBitcoin to make an exact copy of LiveBitcoinCams.
I'm hoping they'll make some changes to differentiate their site soon. So far the only real difference I can see is they've made the menu bar pink, instead of orange.

Ah, sorry about that. I was basing my idea of an appropriate submission off this post: 
Could you please point me to the rules about advertising, for future reference? I wasn't able to find the specific one you mentioned.

Not quite the "first and only" cam girl website...  has been around providing this service for a while :)

Hi guys, just noticed TitsForBitcoin.com went live today. It's probably worth clarifying - that isn't actually the first and only 'Bitcoin only' cam girl website. Our site LiveBitcoinCams.com has been around for a few weeks already, and was designed from the ground up to work exclusively with Bitcoin.
It's great we've got two sites in the field now - there are even more options for amateur cam girls! :)
