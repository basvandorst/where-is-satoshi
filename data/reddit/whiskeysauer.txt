"It will likely be several years before Bitcoin transitions from being an incipient store of value to being a true medium of exchange, and the path it takes to get there is still fraught with risk and uncertainty. it is striking to note that the same transition took many centuries for gold. No one alive has seen the real-time monetization of a good (as is taking place with Bitcoin), so there is precious little experience regarding the path this monetization will take." - Vijay Boyapati

Since naked short selling already exists via places like CME should we anticipate any major price action once BAKKT's cash-settled futures are released?
Also, how smart is it to short sell BTC during a halvening? Isn't that just asking for a squeeze? 
If institutions loan more money into existence to buy BTC, USD inflates and value proposition of BTC increase. 
If institutions loan more money into existence to short BTC, USD inflates and value proposition of BTC increases.
There is nothing to gain but a delay/deterrence of the inevitable.
