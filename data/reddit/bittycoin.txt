This lawsuit will be epic, this guy sued Google and won, sued Facebook and settled out of court.
@_date: 2013-08-03 03:26:54
Let's build Satoshi bank there :)

21st century heist, just trust U.S :)

Thanks, Obama!

Going to 1up this because correspondent accounts in U.S banks will not accept this. Same issue with exchanges opening bank accounts in the U.S.
@_date: 2013-08-16 02:32:07
At least it's not such a surprise when they do it.. you kind of expect it. But I personally never expected it to be harder to do business in the U.S.A then China.
@_date: 2013-06-15 20:08:22
They were only 12 years ahead of us. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 00:58:25
Why is this here? It's not related to Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2013-07-22 08:58:48
Should be an interesting pitch, going to check it out in person.
@_date: 2013-08-07 06:41:54
Don't do it.. I did it and it was just too expensive to operate.
@_date: 2013-08-15 17:14:38
Super unrelated: In communist U.S.A we make it hard to start-up businesses and when you are successful we sue you to oblivion. In capitalist China, as long as you know who to bribe it all works out.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:38:40
Sounds like a cry for more business.

libertybit has the same fees as mtgox, reddit let's start the great migration!
@_date: 2013-07-31 01:58:24
But is it founded by the guy that sued Mtgox!
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:44:59
lol, after 6 months since the bubble.. there's still no way to buy bitcoins..
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:43:13
Libertybit has the same fees as Mtgox and also works with USD.
@_date: 2013-06-10 17:47:32
That's a lot of bold promises, I want to see them deliver it first.
@_date: 2013-09-04 12:00:25
I did the same thing for Blackberry and lost keys.
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:37:23
It's confirmed over here as well: 
@_date: 2013-07-05 01:27:13
Can someone summarize it?
@_date: 2013-06-12 04:02:11
lol, this reminds me of stories I heard about a long time ago.. Keep your money offshore in xyz bank, and we will keep it away from prying eyes... couple months later... finds out xyz bank never existed..
@_date: 2013-08-10 03:58:25
How long will it take the US to hit this stage? Can someone do the quick math?
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:10:57
Let's all move to the land of the free! Can I trade my US citizenship for Canadian citizenship?
@_date: 2013-06-15 04:23:43
Will Apple let you implement this? They purchased all the patents on Authentec chip technology.
@_date: 2013-08-07 06:41:21
Can you post your plans so that we know how you plan on accomplishing those goals? 
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:32:41
What does the Bitcoin Alliance of Canada do?
@_date: 2013-08-15 21:44:22
Thanks Obama.
@_date: 2013-05-20 20:42:40
I think CaVirtex hedges it on Mtgox.
@_date: 2013-08-03 03:27:12
Except we need internet first.
@_date: 2013-07-01 23:19:37
If this goes through, it will double the price of Bitcoin and allow them to liquidate faster as well since they are hoarding 1% of all coins.

The governments can reduce their debts by dealing drugs..

Maybe he's dead? lol
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:08:51
he's blowing smoke up the legislator’s proverbial asses.. he makes a good point that the state of American capitalism and lobbying don't work well for start-ups..
He warned America 2 years ago:

Did some research: They allow guns in Canada as well, just more regulated. So I can bring over my assault rifle as long as it's semi auto, and below 9 in the mag.. The tax goes up to as high as 40%.. Crap, I guess that comes with free medical. Calgary has only 5% sales tax.
@_date: 2013-07-02 01:12:17
This should double and triple the value of Bitcoins!!! I can now put my Retirement fund and RRSP into Bitcoins!!

The illusion of decentralization. 
@_date: 2013-08-17 01:46:45
Well crap, what if Bitstamp and Campbx get hit with the fines. This case just sets precedence for Florida to mess with them. 
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:26:24
Come work for me for free. I will also make you sign tons of contracts with stuff that I don't tell you about and then sue you once you become big. But don't worry, we have the press on our side :)
@_date: 2013-08-01 02:14:55
lol :)

Here is an dummy guide, my parents used to learn after watching it several times: 
@_date: 2013-07-22 23:04:24
But if you already purchase a asic, will you turn it off because the power is too expensive?
@_date: 2013-08-07 22:11:42
Guys, calm down, shit happens, lets just wait it out.. Manufacturing has it's hi-cups sometimes..  
It happens to Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, etc..
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:25:57
Most people don't understand that designing code for FPGAs and designing silicon placement for ASICs are almost completely different task. BFL didn't have the experience or manufacturing capability to do this job, they probably subcontracted the job.

This is pretty neat, and the next step would be to have this database stored at cash registers and distributed p2p within a mall.
@_date: 2013-08-15 21:52:52
Uncle Sam could do that if he has enough hashing power..

Now shell out another $25m before passing GO to collect $200.
