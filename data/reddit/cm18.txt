Calling it irrational is debatable, and it is an option.


Again, debatable.  I would agree that there are trolls on both sides that have inflamed the issue, and I suspect it was intentional... perhaps from rbuttcoin, or some other clandestine group.  The result was a rift, but to blame it on all who support bigger blocks just exacerbates any mending of this rift.  The bigger picture is to unite and then immunize against such a future rift.


At the moment, I cannot honestly suggest bitcoin to others either.  However, the overall objective has always been to challenge the existing banking system.  To do that you need people who care enough to tell their friends about bitcoin and to have the momentum needed to carry bitcoin to the next stages of evolution.


Nor can it be delayed until its coded ideal is perfect and ready in 10 years.  Momentum is important.


We're not talking about a small number of users.  We're also talking about the toxicity that kill's people's care and will.  These are precious resources we're talking about, and they have been spent unwisely.  To run roughshod over such a large number of users over such a stupid issue is a waste.


It would be unwise for me to bash Core for the contributions that are being made.  For these advances, I am grateful.  I would still ask the priorities be re-considered, as garnering consensus by catering to a larger block would make hard forking for SegWit much less complicated than a bunch of small soft forks.

There are issues with only increasing the block size to 2mb.  Ultimately there needs to be a way to stem the dispute and allow the block size to grow dynamically, so long as there's enough nodes to support the network.  If you look back through my comments on the fork sub, you'll see that I've proposed that the fork (edit: the rbtcfork sub) remove the hard block size restriction, and use pre-computed fees to stem transaction spam.  If the average transactions per block increase over the target block size, then every 100 or 1000 blocks, the transaction fees increase.  If the average number of nodes increases, then the target block size can increase.
Fees and target block sizes would be dynamic, and there would be no more fighting about the block size, because the argument would then be "Its what the network can support based on the number of supporting nodes."
@_date: 2016-08-09 07:35:45
This infighting has caused many people to give up.  This is the cost of not working to compromise to keep the community strong and vocal about regulatory statutes.  Bitcoin was supposed to subvert national currencies, but now governments are going to find ways to subvert bitcoin through regulation... but there's no vocal will left.
@_date: 2016-08-25 21:38:18


The theory is that if the block size rises to much, then nodes will abandon support for the network.  This is one of the arguments for keeping the block size at 1mb.  Thus dynamically tying the block size to the number of nodes removes this argument.  The only human decision is the target number of valid nodes.  The rest would be dynamic.


I totally agree, but there's the community factor where peace is actually just as important, and probably MORE important at this point.  If this issue can be put to rest, then the move to forkBTC and the infighting can stop.  The result would be "on-boarding" all those alienated by the fighting.  It is "compromise" to bring people back together for the common long term goals.
EDIT: Consider for a moment the danger of a fractured community and people abandoning bitcoin because of the fighting.  If regulators and control freaks are watching, they'll be waiting till enough people abandon and then sneak in their bitcoin killing laws.  The civil war is by far more dangerous to bitcoin than the technical inadequacies of increasing the bitcoin block size.
EDIT2: Also, if the block size is actually considered, a lot of difficult soft forks can be avoided by having a united community.  If the network is united, hard forks become much easier.  95% is achievable if the network and people running the nodes can agree.
@_date: 2016-08-17 07:20:07
The following would push the price up:
* Significant breakthroughs in LN completion.
* Indication of a BlockStream hard fork to increase the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-08-27 14:50:52
This issue can be overcome.  But it takes effort and a willingness to work with people to show them how to be safe.  How many of you have done this lately?  And why or why not? I know I'm not.
The will to do this is driven by care, but there is a lack of care because of the rift.  The result is a stagnant price.
@_date: 2016-08-27 05:35:53
No, banks and governments are the enemies of inclusion.  If regulation were not so steep, more finantial services would exist.  KYC laws make it very difficult for people to get into the banking system.  Governments have lots of rules for how banks can be run.  Also, banks don't like competition, so they get in bed with government to create laws that exclude competing services.

@_date: 2016-08-11 07:53:01
Basically, those BFX "coins" are a promise to pay in the future.  The rate of return is estimated by those "speculating" about the future return on those coins and then they discount the value back to the present.  Thus these coins have some value based on Bitfinex's reputation and the estimates on how long it will take to repay the coins.

@_date: 2016-08-25 22:27:56


Yes, but then you could also argue that the majority current nodes are fake.  How can you actually tell?
Hence, as I stated above, it may have to be several people looking at the nodes and deciding that they're fake or real and submitting a number indicating the number of real nodes. 
I'm not saying my proposed solution is perfect.  I'm saying it stops the infighting over the block size.
@_date: 2016-08-25 22:11:35
Yep.  I acknowledged that in my post to the btcfork.  It might have to be something the devs or miners get to put into the network.
Also, I can think of a few ways to verify that a node is a full node.  For example you can require it to hash random blocks together and cross compare to verify that it's not cheating.  Another trick would be to send it both a valid and invalid transaction and verify that it does not relay the invalid one, but does relay the valid one.
Anyhow, the point is that it is important to bring the dispute to an end, and setting up a dynamic block size system would be the compromise to end the dispute.
@_date: 2016-08-26 07:43:16


Nope.  That's an appeal to ask me and others who still care to give up.  Its not about large blocks any longer.  Its about strengthening what people care about in the bitcoin community.  The sidelining of such a large portion of people is demoralizing and weakens bitcoin and crypto as a whole.  If the objective is to challenge the banking system, then this fracturing is devastating to the willpower to see change.  To dismiss this as "you lost, get over it" is a further assault on care, and if the remaining people are this callous and habituated to ignore others, then the overall objective is doomed.
@_date: 2016-08-25 23:08:42


Saying this discounts the original argument for increasing the block size.  Now it's actually beyond that.  Even if it is the rational thing to do, you have to consider that not everyone is rational, especially a large group of people.  So if you're trying to convince the world to take bitcoin, you've got to at least deal in the irrational, and the semi-rational, as well as the emotional.  To consider these factors IS the rational thing to do.
If you're wife is pregnant and wants ice-cream, is it rational to suggest the scientific formula is steak and eggs, and refuse to go and get some ice-cream?  The super-rational thing is to understand and balance all the factors including the human.


If there is consensus, then how's that centralization?


I disagree.  In-fighting happens when one or both sides refuse to compromise.  If all sides work toward compromise then there is no fighting.  What helps people compromise is to see the bigger picture and work toward it rather than focusing on the petty issues.  What destroys the compromise is when fear or hate are injected into the discussion and trust is destroyed. (e.g. toxicity)


And that is the problem.  There is a dispute in the rules.  There is no give and take and no mechanism for outlet, other than total forkage and fracturing.  If those controlling the code had played fair and not used the powers of this sub, the bitcoin.org, and the github repository, or come up with a way to actually allow a vote, then there would not be a dispute.  The rule is "we rule bitcoin", and the result is this stupid dispute, inflamed by trolls on both sides of the fence. (Which I suspect is actually planned or funded by nefarious outsiders...)


See my paragraph above.  There has not been any room for dissent under this "roof".  To many have been banned from this sub who have valid complaints.  It could also be said that the control of the repository, bitcoin.org and constitutes an attack on decentralization.
The only way to mend the community and still allow the existing development is to compromise and bring the large blockers back into the fold.  Trust needs to be rebuilt so people can start caring again.
@_date: 2016-08-25 04:55:06
Monero uses lots of block space to accomplish its anonymity feature.  Clearly, single on chain scaling is not the solution for this coin.
As per projecting the argument to the large vs small block within the bitcoin community, the large blockers do not advocate the logic that larger blocks solve all the scaling problems, rather that larger blocks should be allowed as a partial short term solution.  As Antonopolis has stated "all scaling solutions should be implemented".
What's more, because there is such an unwillingness to even increase the block size to meet some of the demand, and because this unwillingness to allow a larger block size has resulted in a major rift.  This infighting has caused many people to stop caring about what bitcoin was originally about... to challenge the existing debt based money system.
The only way to heal this rift is to allow the block size to grow and to mend the rift between the community members.  Peace is what's needed more than scaling at the moment, but since people fall for the "us vs. them", and because there is very little give and take from the core group, the fighting continues to drive away new adoption and destroys the care people once had for the original cause.  This toxicity is what kills the care people have, and it has to go before the healing can begin.  Once this happens, we can pick up and start to drive more adoption... but not until then.
@_date: 2016-08-27 14:55:02
* Real scaling
* A mending of the community divide... or a peaceful fork.
@_date: 2016-08-25 13:02:29
To say that is ~~decisive~~divisive.  Many of us care enough that we are now looking to fork to move around the existing block chain.  It's not all about making a profit.  Its about keeping momentum to spread  crypto as quickly and widely as possible so that future generations are debt free.
In order to succeed, bitcoin needs adoption in a quick manner.  As it stands, the existing fiat system is racing to get ahead of bitcoin so that its system dominates.
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:36:20
How does all this help mend the rift?  1/3 to 1/2 the active users are on rbtc, and many have experienced either banning or post removal.
I could start picking apart what you mentioned here, but that does not serve my purpose of trying to mend the rift in the communities.  It would just delve down the rabble hole of arguments one way or another, only serving to put everyone in a defensive posture and not accomplishing anything.  I would simply ask the moderator team to step back and re-think how things are moderated.  When posts are made and not shown, or people are banned, thing turn venomous and trust is eroded.

@_date: 2016-08-26 07:05:09


Not quite.  We are not talking about positions of power.  We're talking about proving that mending a rift by NOT asserting power and compromising to get on board.  In elections its more about simply conning people for a short period of time so as to get their vote and then getting money to con them again.


If you are trying to compare it to preserving 1mb, it's not really what most bitcoiners signed up for.  What makes bitcoin valuable are the following rules:
1. No censorship of sending transactions.
2. No growing the pool of coins over 21 million.
3. Inexpensive transactions (when compared with banking).
4. Fast settlement of transactions (when compared with sending funds through the banking system).
5. Semi anonymity, better than banking but not necessarily better than cash.
These are the important rules.  How they are enforced debatable.


I don't buy it.  The divide created over this stupid issue and inflamed by the resulting censorship and the inability to talk frankly about the conflict of interests is what is destroying bitcoin's potential.  Compromise (give and take) is the hallmark of a healthy community.  Politics is the art of exercising and keeping power (domination of one set of views over another set of views) through words... usually obfuscation and sophistry.  Politics is highlighting one viewpoint at the expensive of another group or person, no matter how damaging the overall outcome is.  Compromise is when you recognize that the other person is like you, but has different preferences.  It is saying, "We'll do it your way this time, and next time we'll do it ours.".  It's a sharing of power, whereas, politics is the garnering of power for one's own purpose or objective.
Dominating the issue and not compromising is the suffocation of care.  It turns peoples attitude from friendly to viciousness and destructiveness.  If this is the type of environment that is desired, then you're on the right track.

@_date: 2016-04-13 09:58:00
Technically correct, but misleading.  Miners don't "force" a hardfork, they vote on a hardfork which triggers events and signals a change in the block size.  If people decide to reject the vote and stay on 1MB, there is nothing preventing them from doing so, its just most of the network will move without them.
@_date: 2016-08-27 21:30:09
No.  It would.
We, "Core-haters" (as you try to categorize us) are put out by the ham fisted moves and the conflict of interests that we simply cannot talk about on rbitcoin.  When we try to bring them up we're filtered, censored, or in some cases banned.  Its really frustrating to not be able to point out what's going on.  When we hit these blackouts, it inflames many in that camp, causing lots of vitriol.
My take on all this is that the small vs large block dispute is absolutely stupid.  It's akin to a religious war over whether Jesus ate with his left or right hand.  Its stupid, but because of the censoring and the unwillingness to compromise, along with lots of what I believe is organized trolling, we are divided.
@_date: 2016-04-14 00:38:05


They do have a vote.  Blocks are being marked by classic miners at a current rate of 5 to 6%.


If you define consensus as the network, and the miners only make up 1%, then the numbers are even worse, as only 65% of the nodes support Core, the rest are a mix of other nodes that support 2mb or more.  Hence, arguing that the consensus is node count makes it all the easier to demand a fork.  If the miners vote for a fork at 75%, the node count that would support 2mb is going to be well above 75% if it grows in proportion to miner support.  Therefore, your argument makes no sense, and there is no debunking.  If anything, the "network" is leading the miners in 2mb support.
PS:  Would you then agree that the vote to hard fork is up to the nodes and not the miners?  If so, is it core's policy to change code to allow 2mb if 75% of the "network" agrees to it?

@_date: 2016-04-14 19:05:41


And in just a moment, I'll toss that accusation back at you.


&lt; Insert your comment from above to refute your comment here...&gt;
We would both agree that the technical problem is that of transaction volume vs. distributed networks.  In essence, LN is envisioned as a way to make transactions more distributed (although I would argue that it makes easier targets for censorship and government cohesion).  Although LN is a way cool idea, it is complicated and difficult to implement, and has the potential to be worse because finding channels to send coins on is tricky without centralization.  When people see a problem, they usually take the simplest and easy way first. (That would probably be core's argument against 2mb, but it also applies to finding channels to send coins on.)  This will cause people to favor a few business, as people are creatures of habit.
I would hope that core can step back from their hardened stance and consider alternatives to this problem, because forcing the LN solution on everyone is shutting down rational discussion and causing lots of problems in itself.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:10:39
Right now transactions are cleared on the block chain.  However, in the LN, you have to have connections to people in order to process transactions outside of the blockchain.  This means that in order for the LN to be successful, people will search for central "hubs" (businesses and individuals that make money by clearing the transactions on LN "chains") where they can send money to others.  In essence, these "hubs" will replace the transaction clearing mechanisms of the blockchain that is neutral as to where and who owns the coins.
Now, if this is the case, how much easier will it be for governments to legislate against these hubs?  How difficult will it be for these hubs to be served national security letters demanding that they prevent all transactions from being sent to the legal defense fund of say Snowden, or some other political dissident that deserves support?  What type of KYC rules will be made on these "hubs"?
@_date: 2016-04-14 10:30:30


You need to read "The Creature From Jekyll Island".  These are not pussy cats and they're not going to wait.  These people want control, and the LN is making it easier.


Either you've not read the all the shit that's happening in the world, or you know these things happen and you're here to downplay the point.  I personally, think you're here to downplay the issue.


If you operate as a major LN facilitator, it is much easier to target you.  Instead of 5k nodes, governments or power freaks would only have say threaten 100 (probably much less).  LN consolidation WILL happen because most people will not have the time and energy to develop a network of contacts.  In fact, if you read through some of the comments, you can see that people are already thinking in terms of dealing with businesses to fill the LN gap.  By taking things off the neutral block chain, we lose.
@_date: 2016-04-19 23:50:36
Yep.  Such thing.  Go look at ripple and tell us how decentralized that is.  Its the nature of the beast.  If you don't have a general ledger (a "central" neutral place to clear transactions) there's go to be either millions of little side chains that are difficult to connect lots of people with lots of different other people, or you have 10 to 100 companies connecting 90% of the people and clearing 90% of the transactions.

Trying to think how the law would be interpreted.  Setting up a score sheet or a ledger that facilitates the existence of bitcoin is kinda hard to classify as a money transmission activity.  However, someone running a business where he/she facilitates transactions specifically for money for specific individuals could easily be legally defined as "money transmission".
Its all around how easy or hard it is to legally classify something, and from what I can see, it looks fairly easy to do so.
Anyhow, there are other reasons why having people responsible for clearing transactions.  It has to do with transaction censorship and the ease at which laws can be written to "regulate" people on the LN.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:48:36
The best way to make a monopoly is to get the government to kill your competition.  If the LN is to take off, there will have to be people willing to act as transaction clearing hubs that would do the same thing as the block chain is currently doing.  Wouldn't people with these connections be considered "money transmitters" under the current law?  What type of business can legally work as "money transmitters" in all 50 states?... Banks and Western Union.
LN is a trap because it centralizes transactions away from the neutral block chain into the hands of a few privileged enough to get "licensing".
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:34:31


If I have bitcoin in a channel through a bitcoin whale who is facilitating transactions, there must be a relationship between the whale, you and me, in order for me to send you coin on the LN network.  Correct?
I will admit if I'm wrong, so please explain.  Are there middle men in the process of finding a path to send coins on the LN?  Must these middle men have lots of coin?  Do they have to have lots of connections to people in order to be effective?


Its not all about being censorship resistant via the internet.  Its about avoiding being thrown behind bars, intimidated or having your house ransacked because you are doing something that could be construed as illegal.  While this can be worked around by having the whales that facilitate the LN transactions re-located to a different country, it is still going to be a nasty hit when it happens.
It sorta reminds me of how those privacy advocates house was ransacked by the police with a warrant because they were operating a Tor node and someone uploaded CP.  The trick is to be as legally clean as possible and give no possible excuses for harassment or legal ensnarement.

It is signaling that they want a change.  You are just mincing words.


No, I'm pointing out that your argument that the miners are not the deciding point for consensus because they only represent 1% of the network is falatious, because if that were the cryteria of a consensus, then nodes would win.




By that definition of "consensus", then its only core that can create change via "soft forks".  100% is impossible, and you know it.  All that would be needed to derail a change would be to create 1% who disagree.  This is not a recipe for a decentralized money system, it is a recipe for an authoritarian centrally controlled system as only a very small handful of people get to decide what changes.


This is incorrect.  The decision to move from 2mb to 1mb was done through "governance".  The decision to change to segwit is governance.  What you are basically arguing is that bitcoin governance **should never change** from the core committing team, even if 75% of those involved in bitcoin decide otherwise.
@_date: 2016-04-14 03:17:06
Bitcoins will not be tied up, but rather transactions will be.  If the current plan goes through and no ledger neutral transaction can take place without paying lots of $$, then 99% of the transactions will be tied up off chain.
Why is this a problem?  Well, for starters, you will need to have centralized entities through which these transactions happen.  You will need to have a relationship with one of these entities simply because they will have the most ways of sending funds to others.
Think about this for a moment.  If you run a node on the bitcoin network, you are basically running an automated ledger system.  However, if you run a service to facilitate transactions on the LN, you are a "money transmitter".  The difference is acute, because there are no laws against running a ledger, but there are very specific laws (for every one of the states of the union) regarding "money transmission".
Finally ask... "Who has licenses to operate as a money transmitter in all 50 states?" and this whole can of worms will open before your eyes.
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:09:46


You're a hoot.  If 75% of the miners vote for Classic, its a vote of no-confidence for core.  There would be a transition as people move to 2mb.  To be sure, there would probably be propaganda against 1mb trying to convince people to ignore the miners, and possibly a move by core to change the PoW to maintain control.  However, such a move would not stop the bleeding and the fork would occur anyhow.  An intransigence stance by core if a 75% vote happened would indicate that core is not interested in a consensus nor is it interested in whats best for crypto.
@_date: 2016-04-14 04:23:09

How does it break fungibility?  Your coins are either on chain 1 or 2.  Part of the specification of the bitcoin address says which branch and which set of computers to talk with.  If your client does not know, it queries both networks.
How does it lead to unlimited supply?  Instead of 25 btc every 10 minutes, each branch would reward 12.5.  Miners would be merged mining 2 chains for the combined reward of 25 btc every 10 minutes.
Also, "sidechain" is sorta a misnomer, as it would be dual chains, or quad chains, etc.  Sidechain would imply a main chain.

@_date: 2016-04-20 23:52:10


My understanding is that while hashing for a solution on one block, you also keep an eye out for solutions that also fit another chain.  It's sorta like mining for gold, but while you are at it, you also keep an eye out for gems and silver.  
How does this cut the hashing rate of a target chain?  Further, if the side chain is offering a reward, then there is more profit to be made and more hashing power can be brought online.
If the reward is split between two chains and merged mining is employed, the same reward is being dispensed every 10 minutes.  Again, how it it that doing this is going to cut security by 50%?  The miners will be employing the same amount of hashing power, but the security per transaction is actually going to be higher because you're looking for two solutions at once with the same hashing power.
@_date: 2016-04-20 00:05:14
Exactly.  If bitcoin is to stay what it was envisioned, you need competing solutions, not "one size fits all".  LN is one of several solutions, but its the only one being allowed by the developers.  As long as there is only the LN, people should dissuade others from adopting bitcoin, because it will become the thing bitcoin was trying to fight against.

Right now there is a huge resistance to getting bitcoin.  It's a  pain in the ass, yet still it grows.  Thus there has to be a reason for its popularity.  Then the question is, can a GovCoin or BankCoin emulate these reason's enough to satisfy those reasons for buying bitcoin?  I would answer... no, not really.

Yes, I understand that you may be worried about bitcoin and its future.  But the way you post and claim he's attempting to be a dictator makes you sound nutty.  It's not really good support to say he's acting like a dictator for posting to a blog that not many people read or visit.  It's more accurate to call it inappropriate.  
What's more, is that unless there's a real abuse that is causing a problem, (which you don't really make a case for) people don't care that he's voicing his opinion on bitcoin.org.


Censorship is when someone stops you from saying something.  He's not stopping you from posting this.  He has not deleted your two posts.

It may be inappropriate, but you don't really have good support to show he's attempting to be a dictator about it.  Further, his statement that it is "contentious" is factual.


I think you're confusing influence with authoritarian situation.  Further, since the blog is not readily available to everyone the amount of influence from this blog is limited.

ISIS is being funded through western interests.  No "movement" of this size can exist without some state sponsorship. (Real grass roots movements take decades to build.) The only other powers capable of pulling this off would be Russia, China and Iraq, but its not in those countries best interest to back such an extremist group.  One should also remember that ISIS is an offshoot of the Syrian Al Qaeda which was also being backed by the U.S. (through Saudi and Qatar).  Also, much of the equipment that ISIS possesses is U.S. equipment.  Supposedly this equipment was left behind when the U.S. withdrew, but that does not make sense either, as parts and ammo would have been taken on a withdrawal.
The existing U.S. power system is looking for a new boogie man, and instead of finding one, they're creating one.

My point is that in order to operate this equipment efficiently, U.S. supplies will be required.

If it's in a bank someplace and you need say $1 million in supplies, transporting that cash to someone willing to take the cash for arms, is going to be tricky.  Buying small stuff (say under $10k) would not be to big of a deal, but for bigger stuff, cash is simply bulky, and risky to transport.

Stock prices are based on expected future value.  If the P/E is high, there is an expectation of lots of future growth.  If the P/E is low (around the P/E of bonds) then people believe it is a sable/mature company that will not grow much.
The same goes for BitCoin.  There is a built in growth value that professional investors are betting on, that is much higher than the actual goods and services that are trading through bitcoin.  If there is a change in the expect growth rate of bitcoin, then you will see a jump or drop in price.  
Also, the more volatile a stock, the higher the expected growth rate.  This happens because the future is harder to predict for that particular stock.  If the stock has shown consistent low growth earnings, the volatility of the stock will be much lower.

ISIS has billions and surely has major banking backing, because even bitcoin cannot yet fund terrorists at this level.

[google trends](
Basically, the excitement is dying off.  This has happened before.  Best bet is to buckle up and wait it out.
In June of 2011, the price spiked from around $1 up to $30, the 5 month period after this spike let the price down to ~$2, and the next year put it back at around $10.  It was not until around April 2013 (about 2 years later) that the price spiked again to around $260.  The price settled back to around $100, and then in late November it spiked again to $1200+.  Each time it spiked, it fell back and then found a new base, and each time the volatility decreased.  So, don't be surprised if the price falls to like $250-$300.
Look at it this way.  In January of 2011, the price was around $.30.  1,183 days has passed since then.  If you assume a daily increase of .5%, the current price would be around $109.  If you assume a daily increase of .6%, the current price would be around $355.  At the current price of $475, the daily increase is around .625% per day... and that's just insane.
So, as long as you believe bitcoin has a future and there are potential uses, then just keep stacking coins.  If, however, something has fundamentally changed and bitcoin is either obsolete or you see a major flaw, then dump it and find something else to play with.

Might work, but there are still a good number of miners that simply don't want SegWit.  The real issue is the lack of consensus, caused by the division in the forums, caused by the actions of those in control of the default forums.
A common forum should have generated consensus over time.  What you are now seeing is the result of that ejection of opposing viewpoints from the main forums.

Because of the limited transaction space and the rising fee problem, I would advise against using Bitsquare at the moment.

False.  A hijacker does not seek a consensus vote by miners.  A hijacker does not try to convince people to use a different version of the software.




Did I say it was off limits?  I think you're getting things mixed up.  "offlimits" implies that it cannot be discussed.  I said it "should be open to discussion", which does not say its is off limits.  Do you really think BP101 can be easily discussed in this sub or will it be downvoted because of the overwhelming number of people on this sub that don't give a shit about it?  "open to discussion" has nothing to do with "off limits".

""In 2000, he ran for California State Assembly as a Libertarian and came under fire for calling America’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) a “bunch of murderers”
Kind of a dumb thing to do, but at 22 years of age running for public office... what can you say?  What's more and not indicated here is that the AFT knew others were doing the exact same thing that Ver was doing and had been doing it for years.  Only after the conviction were his competition given warnings and instructed to change their methods of delivery to comply with the laws.
Thus, when people haul out the "Convicted Felon" label on Ver, while accurate, is a very dishonest and cheap shot.

Painting it as an attempt to hijack where the miners would have to vote 75% is weak.  Anyone paying attention or had not been snowed by the lack of information (because of "moderation" of r/bitcoin) knew Gavin was trying to undo a roadblock by gathering a consensus.  To try and paint it as a hijack is just disingenuous.

This is the result of fracturing the community because one side cannot post all that is required to voice their view points.  I've responded to this issue before.
From my comments:


If an anti-core supporter cannot vent and be corrected, then he will go to another sub where he can vent.  The pro-core group is going to stay on rbitcoin because they don't want to deal with the negativity created by not being able to post to rbitcoin, and will never get their viewpoints corrected by the anti-core group.  Thus the two groups stay divided and no natural correction process can take place.  Each camp has its view point that can never meld with the other to reach a amicable resolution so positive action can be taken.  The root is not being able to post about topics that are taboo here on rbitcoin.

You are missing the root problems.  Because the alt sub users are often those who were "moderated" and cannot discuss particular things, we now have two subs that are more or less echo chambers.  You want to think this is the fault of RV, and those on the other sub will feel this is the result of Theymos and BlockStream.
When there are echo chambers, neither side can freely discuss with the other side their grevences and be corrected for having incorrect viewpoints or at lease come to a compromise.  You can post open letters all you want but it will not help unless there's a common forum where everyone can bash each other until consensus is reached.

Just because an anti-core post gets pushed to the top of this sub does not mean its a "dedicated propaganda campaign" its more likely a lot of people agree with such a post, but the ~~large~~small block group reads it as a "campaign".


I think you have something here, but I think you're aim is off.


Being positive while ignoring how it negatively impacts the rest of the community is not a net positive.


That assumes (and you know what they say about assumptions) that 1/3 of the community does not have anything legitimate to say.  That's an arrogant apporach, and if they're not just whiny, they'll be apt to act.


Sorry.  You're just simply wrong.  The inability to post (and note that I cannot use the "c" word without being "c'ed" temporarily before the mods will approve my post) is rampant.

If you truly believe it is exaggerated, I challenge you to never visit the other sub, nor any other altcoin sub.  You will be seriously ill-informed within a few months.
If anything voicing the distain for one group and demonizing them only serves to help the banks and the existing banking system.  Stepping back from this, I really think this is all an engineered divide and conquer battle that is happening, where the two groups are fighting over the block size (which is really a stupid issue over a fucking constant) instead of fighting against the banking system which is what bitcoin is designed for.
While we bicker over the block size, instead of compromising to hardfork in SegWit along with a larger block size, other alt-coins are inventing like crazy, seeking to implement sharding, insta-spend, coin mixing, and many other cool features.  Bitcoin is truly way behind technically.  Its only real advantage at this point is the first to market.

If you're using that definition, you're not conveying your real meaning, as most people associate with the first definition, unless your intent is to be inflammatory.
If you've listened to him, you'll understand that he an admirer of Any Rand, who advocates individuality and the ability to make your own rational decisions.  If people are enamored with him to the excess you're implying, I cannot see how "cult" would describe his intent.  You've also got to alleviate his avocation for anarchy vs. "cult" accusation.  Someone who advocates anarchy is not trying to be a leader.
I think the reason people can get the "cult leader" label to stick is because he tries his hand at armature psychology to "help" people.  The sad part is that those individuals often have weakened minds and cannot put together the logic, so they become attached to a strong personality.  Clearly, that's not his intent, it just happens that way.  However, if you stand back and analyse rationally with a balanced viewpoint, you really cannot call him a "cult leader".  The only logical way is if some beef with him or his philosophy and want to unjustly discredit him.


I'm just using your words.


Intent is important, and I cannot see the intent as wanting to develop a cult.  His intent is clearly to influence.  As for donations, someone of his caliber can probably make a hell of a lot more money creating a real cult, instead of going through all the contortions of logic and reasoning.

Anyone who studies business knows that it is paramount to obtain as much market share as quickly as possible.  To delay is to invite competition, and there IS competition coming... in the form of digital state currencies.  If Bitcoin and other crypto's are stagnant and don't gain market-share quickly, the advantages disappear and the state currencies win.


If you're a new user and your first experience is delayed transactions (say 5 hours) after paying $.25 cents, you are not going to be impressed.  In essence, doubling, quadrupling, or whatever it takes to make the system run on chain WILL allow people like myself to start promoting bitcoin again, because we would know that there are multiple paths to scaling and those controlling the code are using all avenues to increase throughput.  As it stands many of us now think that bitcoin has been taken over and now we DO NOT promote it because we don't want to promote something that has been subverted.


Oh hell yes! ... PLEASE increase transactions of chain as well.  I don't advocate against LN.  I encourage it.  That's the miscommunication that is happening.  Those like myself want BOTH.  We want ALL scaling options examined.  There's nothing wrong with developing LN at the same time as increasing on chain scaling.  What is wrong is blocking on chain scaling for some nefarious reasons.
All the division happening is because of control.  The misconceptions you have about those who want large blocks are distorted because our message is not being allowed.

EDIT: If I cannot say "core is a bunch of wankers" and have someone tell me "you're full of shit" and then tell me why, or have someone say "large blockers have their heads up their asses" and have someone else reply "you have no fucking idea what you're talking about" and explain why, then the rift will never be resolved and things will only get worse.

While much of this nastiness has been removed from this sub, the other side is pissed for not being able to point out what's happening.


It is because it takes away one more reason to adopt bitcoin.  Bitcoin could compete in this realm, but instead it is lost its edge.  The only crypto that I know of that safely sends transactions instantaneously (for about a $.10 fee) is DashPay.  So, DashPay serves as an example of a distributed payment system that is not controlled by a government that is currently technically superior to Bitcoin, yet will never be able to achieve phone payment dominance... by the simple fact of lack of market share.  (Note that's not to say DashPay's scaling is superior to LN, but rather it's market share will not allow it to win.)

The cashless society is the controller's wet dream.  That's why bitcoin has not yet been taken out.  You'll also note that Casascius was harassed out of business and there's a lot of push to get people to abandon cash (doing away with the 500 EUR, and the disappearance of the $1000 and $500 bills, along with people saying we should also get rid of the $100).
Don't be surprised when BitNotes.org gets taken out when it becomes to popular.

Technically, state actors could more or less shutdown bitcoin right now while it is in its infancy, however, there is a political expense in doing so.  Delaying bitcoin's growth gives the state time to formulate a plan for justification of eliminating bitcoin.  While you want to say there is a political justification for keeping the number of transactions small to avoid centralization of nodes and such, we've already seen a demonstration of centralization in the form of eyeballs... specifically, this sub, bitcoin.org and the bitcoin repository.  State actors need not openly ban bitcoin, they just need to make it unusable and to keep it centralized by a few key actors.
[Rules for Rulers](
So, your argument may hold some water at the point where it starts becoming more expensive to run a node, it does not hold water if bitcoin is hobbled to the point where it cannot grow beyond the reach of state actors.  Also, without experimenting with larger networks and making inroads such as sharding the block chain so that everyone can do just a small part of the verification process, bitcoin will never be able to reach critical mass.
The LN should be an adjunct to the bitcoin network.  It's initial main purpose should be to transact super small micro transaction.  After it has proven sufficient at this job, then it should be expanded to take on more load as required when the main chain reaches such a size as to become a problem for the average node operator.
In short, the argument that bitcoin is somehow going to be attacked by state actors if the block chain becomes to large does not hold water at the current moment.  What is most pressing is the need to add more users and make it more politically expensive for state actors to take it out.

I think the reason they don't want to load it has to do with how Casascius was pushed out of business because he was threatened by "Government" via "money transmission" laws.  Casascius was selling loaded coins and selling them over the internet.
Another reason is that it is a higher risk to both create AND load coins.  There are more attack vectors via employee embezzlement.  In this senario, even if an employee got a few of the private keys, he could not obtain the secondary key unless he was able to pull the "note" out of circulation and get the second key, which is much harder to do.

He has a point.  The "cells" may not take much funding, but on the other hand, the real fighting is taking place in Syria and northern Iraq.  BTC market cap is way to small to fun the real ISIS war.  Going after "antiques" and bitcoin is bullshit news "reporting".  The real points of control have to be via the big pipes, e.g., those buying oil from ISIS, those selling or giving them weapons and supplies.
It's also being exposed via the sub that ISIS is being equipped and funded by the US to create a pretext for being in Syria.  Russia is also exposing the farce, and has done more damage in a few weeks than the US "bombing campaign". Problem is people are still very brainwashed/mind controlled via the MSM.

And PayPal does not offer a phone payment option as far as I know, but ApplePay does.  If we are taking about how payment systems compete, ApplePay is beating bitcoin in the phone payment department.


You know what they say about assumptions.


Yes.  I understand that.  However, there was a point in time where BitPay could facilitate brick and mortar shops with relative confidence that transactions would not double spend.  Enough so that a $10 lunch payment was a reasonable risk for a 10 minute delay.

Division cannot be mended because much cannot be discussed frankly on one sub, but the other is open to all discussion.  One side cannot come and explain their position, so it looks like "endlessly repeating talking points of how bitcoin has stalled, how Core is killing bitcoin, how raising the blocksize limit aggressively is the only way to save bitcoin".  The lack of discussion results in hatred by the side that is forced out, and looks like trouble makers from those not forced out.  In fact, posting this here, I have to chose my words carefully so as to make sure it will be seen.  THIS is the root of the problem.  People's viewpoint cannot be understood, instead we are left with vitriol and accusing each side of things that are simply misunderstood.

All that I've been reading indicates that the U.S. was involved in the overthrow, and that's NONE of our (American's) business is it?  If you wish to apply PRINCIPLES, then they have to apply universally.  Otherwise they're just self serving justifications and the REAL principles are deception and force.


From what I've gathered, there ARE Neo-Nazi elements.  That does not justify any meddling Russia may have done in your country. (Nor does it justify my countries government meddling in your countries affairs.)


Reports I have indicate that both the protesters AND the police were shot.  You only do that if you're trying to destabilize a government, and the government that replaced the prior one is much more NATO friendly.  It would be stupid of Russia to do this.  Even if the snipers were only shooting at protesters, it still seems illogical, as Russia would want stability in Ukraine, NOT justification for revolt.


This is new to me.  Supporting links in English would be useful.


This supports what I've read about why the existing government did not get into power during the last election.




Then why are screwing around with western social media?  Quit trying to pull my country into a war.  Trying to use my countries power to fight your war makes me want to side more with Russia than it does with Kiev.  If you honestly think that the revolution in Ukraine was a grass roots event, you should dig deeper.


Based on the fact that I can PROVE and know that the U.S. media is waging a propaganda war against Russia (with the objective of preparing the American population for war), and have learned the tactics of the IMF, and that everything fits the facts of what I'm seeing on reddit (hate and downvote campaign against anyone attempting to put the Ukrainian situation in perspective, and subversion of the moderators on reddit... basically blatant manipulation), and the fact that all the information fits with regards to a global strategy of U.S. domination.  Also by the fact that you admit you're Ukrainian, and the article I linked indicates a push to create an army of Ukrainians using the internet to support the cause against Russia.
After reading your response, my opinion has changed a bit.  I still suspect that Ukraine is being used as a pawn, but by BOTH Russia and the U.S. government/NATO.  But now I do have suspicions about Russian tactics.  I still understand that your country is of strategic importance to Russia (gas pipelines food from eastern Ukraine, and to prevent ABM's from being placed to close to the Russian border), and that the government that is currently running U.S. foreign policy is also messing around in Ukraine with the objective of subduing Russia.  Ideally, I want the people of Ukraine (both east and west) to be able to decide for themselves what type of government to have.  But because both Russia and the U.S. are struggling, your country is stuck in the middle.

I don't buy it.  You suggest that CNBC is negligent in its reporting.  Any intelligent reporting is going to cut to the key questions.  The real question is NOT "who is funding" or "how are they funded?" but "who is supplying?".  The incompetence shown should be fired, but instead, reporting like this continues.  Thus, CNBC's report is not "reporting" but propaganda.
The author Noam Chompsky has spent most of his entire life exposing the main stream media as propaganda all of his adult life.  His book "Manufacturing Consent" clearly illustrates MSM works in conjunction with government to spin the narrative to the American public.

It clearly was.  When the secretary of state is working with those who come into power BEFORE a revolution, then the U.S. is involved in the overthrow.  Multiple U.S. politicians understand that is what is going on and have said so.




That does not fly.  Instability in Ukraine threatens the gas pipelines running through Ukraine into Europe.  Even now, it will take several years to rout the natural gas to China where it can be sold.  Further, most of Russia's revenue comes from oil, which has been hit by a drop in oil prices.


If people in the U.S. are apathetic to what is happening in Ukraine, then clearly, there's manipulation on social media to hit anyone who try's to counter the notion that there's more to Ukraine than a revolution and strategic importance.  Posts would not get hit by massive down votes and vitriolic comments, rather a logical explanation of events should have followed.  The only logical reason for such posts and comments would be manipulation from an organized group seeking to shape opinion instead of putting things in perspective.  The article I linked verifies that there are elements using social media to shape U.S. opinion.


As I've stated, Ukraine is important on several fronts.  One being ABM's being placed close to it's borders.  Another is the importance of Crimea as a cold weather naval port.  And finally, eastern Ukraine is a source of food.  When western powers and the IMF start fucking around in Ukraine there's little doubt that Russia's going to respond.  If the media fails to point these things out and when trying to point these things out you get hammered, and all that's left is vitriolic comments (that appeal to emotion) without substance, then clearly, its a propaganda war being waged against Russia in the western social media.
Personally, if posters wish to paint Putin as a vial dictator who's actions are heinous, is fine as long as it is supported.  But as soon as valid observations and information are being hidden and taken out of circulation, then we have a problem.

I'll put on my tin foil hat for a bit.  Normally I would put these comments in but the actions of operation choke point are so blatant that some conspiracy thinking is kinda required.
There are many in the conspiracy movement that think Obama is of the same philosophy as the Soviet era communists.  In fact if you look at the planks of the communist manifesto, you'll see there's quite a bit of correlation, and even more if you assume that government and big business have merged  This sounds contradictory, but really, the communist manifesto and what is happening to America simply boils down to the idea that man does not have rights, and that he's an animal that needs to be managed.  So, the people of this thinking have been working to find all manners of manipulation to get people to accept this control, be it violence, or trickery.  In this case, the trickery (trying to convince people that guns and gold sales should be lumped with porn and some other shady types) did not work because the 2nd amendment types were all over this.

It all depends on how quickly people lose interest.  I'm basing $30 on the previous bubble.  It took 5 months for it to drop from $33 to $2, and then bobbled around under $5 for the next year before starting another run up.  If things repeat exactly the same, but at a higher level, then the low will be $16.12 in the next 2 to 3 months.  So I figure $30 is a good target to buy in at.
