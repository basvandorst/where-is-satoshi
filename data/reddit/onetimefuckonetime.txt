I’m lazy, that’s an excuse I think

I’m in this boat, I feel like it’s good to enjoy life and save at the same time. Don’t be completely reckless but if you work hard you need to enjoy some of that money because you’re not gonna take it with you in the end.

If I sell my Bitcoin and take my gains on January 2nd I won't need to file my gains into my taxes until 2019, correct?

Uhh, it could be worth it to pay the taxes and take the profit for some people though.

Eh, when it crashes just tell them you panicked and got out 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:53:51

Are there any books that bring solid negative points against bitcoin? I’m reading the internet of money currently and would like to hear some objective arguments.

One of the articles I read said they’re only looking into people who traded more than $20k in a year, and the Coinbase owners said they’re even trying to fight that still.

You can bet on bitcoin rising or falling
