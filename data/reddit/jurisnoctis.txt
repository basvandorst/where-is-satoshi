Wow what an utter asshole :O

I see. No interest in mining with altruism in mind then, I assume.
Do any pools have a random tx pickup logic? Or do all just sort by highest fee...
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:48:32
And you realize that they're now looking to use BCH or other cryptos for their future donations, since the fees are so darn high?
Good for the world with this philanthropy and all, but let's stay prudent about our problems, guys.

Definitely the same, but I was comparing his lack of integrity to Donald Trump.

Users, will not. Mods/Admins, will.
He can however, reply to PMs.
So... there's that.

Elisa seems just as toned as her, and just as young.
I think she just has more experience/stake in the company, which may or may not be a good thing.
If you're in for nasty business, I guess go with her. If you're more vanilla I'd give Elisa a try.

Well, I can still buy with ACH transactions. Note: I can use my own money to buy BTC.

So you use the female endings for  φυσιολογική   and  δύσκολη  , but use masculine in  αυτό  , so it's unclear whether your inferred object is the masculine act of learning the language, or the feminine concept of the Greek language.
Maybe change αυτό  to feminine is after  ενδιαφέρον add in "glosa", for language \(but literally tongue\), might be the "best" way to say it
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:35:17
Probably due to the claims of censorship of anything anti\-bitcoin \(BTC\), anti\-Theymos\+co on here

 φίλο  or  φίλοs, is the third person masculine, the 2nd person \(you talking TO the subject\), is as the person said below,  φίλε.

Meanwhile I haven't got any donation (let alone bitcoin) in my 0-1 viewers max stream.

I have never had reddit gold and fail to see any of the craze.
Not exactly begging, but I guess I would be curious to try. :)
