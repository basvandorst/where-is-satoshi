It will make a difference in the long run. I agree the anticipation will probably send the price up more. Its a scheduled release, people know exactly when its coming so that is why I think the immediate impact is smaller than most think.

It's not that people do not care, its a difference in how people view Bitcoin will scale.
Bitcoin Cash wants to scale through all onchain transactions. Eventually if they get the world using it, would need 50GB+ blocks. Their solution is a bandaide on a broken bone in my opinion.
Bitcoin wants to scale with payment channels and other off chain transactions. Although it causes short term pain while everything is developed, in the long term is the better solution.

If you are in the US. It depends on how long you held and how much you make. So long term gains could be 0-20% and short term 0-39.9%.
Even if you are at the common 15%, you would owe like $2-3 on a $30 game. I am sure no one is after you over that. Because they would have to know your cost basis and steam would have to share their transaction info.

I could take Overstock to small claims court over the $200 transaction. Burden of proof there is "more likely than not that it is true". Plus since they conduct business wherever they "said" they shipped it to, you could file the case in your local municipal court.

Deflation is not bad. Deflation mostly is caused by an increase in production which increases supply and lowers prices. If a currency is deflating, people will tend to save more. With more savings it would push down interest rates thus giving incentive people to take out loans and increase investments. The rich and politically connected hate deflation because they can not make more money off of flawed economic policy.

At current dif, you will earn $4 a month and use $9 a month in power. Difficulty continues to rise which will eat away at the $4 in revenue.

At very high transaction rates each block can be over half a gigabyte in size.
It is not required for most fully validating nodes to store the entire chain. In Satoshi's paper he describes "pruning", a way to delete unnecessary data about transactions that are fully spent. This reduces the amount of data that is needed for a fully validating node to be only the size of the current unspent output size, plus some additional data that is needed to handle re-orgs. As of October 2012 (block 203258) there have been 7,979,231 transactions, however the size of the unspent output set is less than 100MiB, which is small enough to easily fit in RAM for even quite old computers.
Only a small number of archival nodes need to store the full chain going back to the genesis block. These nodes can be used to bootstrap new fully validating nodes from scratch but are otherwise unnecessary.
The primary limiting factor in Bitcoin's performance is disk seeks once the unspent transaction output set stops fitting in memory. It is quite possible that the set will always fit in memory on dedicated server class machines, if hardware advances faster than Bitcoin usage does.
