Cold storage itself seems like a failure for a digital currency. It is embarrassing that the whole endeavor has regressed to the highest form of bitcoin security progressing to the point it's to the equivalent of the worst security normal money has (keeping slips of paper physically in your house)

your argument about nodes is "don't be a cry baby"?

At least you have gotten to the point you admit it's basically world of warcraft points.

Of all the currencies that ever failed it's always been the economy that failed, not the actual manifestation of the cash. Zimbabwe dollars didn't crumble to dust, the bills themselves didn't break, it was the economy that broke.

It's almost like the whole bitcoin community is rotten instead of just being a couple bad apples!

It's almost like if you leave the echo chamber of bitcoin you realize that most of the things bitcoin claims aren't actually a thing bitcoin has a monopoly on!

first they ignore you, then they fight you, then you win. am i rite?

How far can you tell? Is "as far as you can tell" mean "I saw a screen shot of a text file"?

Ask the same question but about bitcoin itself.

Wow! two lines look vaguely similar if you ignore they are deviating by billions of dollars! AMAZING!!!!

A coalition of nine major banks into the possibility of the chain block, the underlying technology that makes the digital currency bitcoin possible.
The banks, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and UBS, to explore how they can use this technology to track transactions on the financial markets.
For bitcoins operates the block chain as a decentralized administration, where all transcaties ever made with the coin in stand. This administration is not stored in one place and fraud is impossible, since changes in the block chain through a large part of the bitcoin network should be approved.
David Rutter, Director of R 3 technology, told Reuters that the block chain can cause a revolution in the accounts of traditional financial transactions "with extra security, fewer errors and significant savings."
Concrete plans for the introduction of new technology, the nine banks do not yet have.

It is not self regulating in that the blockchain is a living animal that can alter itself. It is self regulating in that it is an actively developed system and humans can look at and discuss it's flaws and patch incentives that are not working as hoped as conditions change and manifest themselves.

You can look at the graphs for "number of transactions per day" and the graph for "total fees per day" and see that the two are not actually linked as strongly as you may think. The last year has been a huge growth in transaction numbers while following a decline of not only the USD value (which is explainable by the price drop) but ALSO the absolute value of bitcoin fees paid staying totally flat.

Any specific of what exactly they are trying?

What part of this is FUD? Fees make up .4% of the miner's income.  Three months of fees doesn't even pay HALF of what 1 single day of miner subsidy pay.
That is a real problem that really exists. But we still have time to fix things. Doing some stupid "bitcoin is my religion, how dare you say it's not perfect" on some software that is in version 0.10 version is absurd.

Bitcoin was never designed to be anything of the sort and satoshi himself was frequently tweaking the numbers on things through the early patches as bitcoin developed. Changing things like dust limits and block sizes several times as conditions changed. 
Bitcoin is an actively developed software program in beta, Now is the time to figure out what needs to be done to make the economy run smoothly. If bitcoin is already some sort of weird self creating god animal that is already perfect in every way then why not just mark it version 1.0 and disband the development?

Furthermore, if true does anyone know what purpose these exist for?
