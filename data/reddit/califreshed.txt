I understand that it may simply be a joke phrased used by Bitcoiners, but it seems a lot of the leaders in the Bitcoin community can't do a fully serious job. You wouldn't get regular stock exchanges posting things like this. Look at their last 3 tweets - 
They are so obviously pro BTC, you didn't have a '  going down! ' tweet when it was slowly decreasing over the past 4 months. 
It is unneeded and unprofessional for such a company to seemingly be releasing propoganda, don't you think?
Fwiw I'm big in BTC and want to see them rise.

IRS Virtual Currency Guidance: Virtual Currency Is Treated as Property for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes; General Rules for Property Transactions Apply 
IR-2014-36, March. 25, 2014
WASHINGTON – The Internal Revenue Service today issued a notice providing answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) on virtual currency, such as Bitcoin. These FAQs provide basic information on the U.S. federal tax implications of transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency.
In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance -- but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.
The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:
* Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.
* Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.
* The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.
* A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property. 
Further details, including a set of 16 questions and answers, are in Notice 2014-21, posted today on IRS.gov.

Sorry about the noobness, I try to understand as much as possible, but this PGP and verification thing is over my head. What I'm asking is, is there anyway I can take your message, then verify its real to confirm its you. For example on the brainwallet site, I copied &amp; pasted
Address: 1Mfts72tEqDyMPRwXmmVAHkCxCzM8CW5Ah
This is an example of a signed message from 1Mfts72tEqDyMPRwXmmVAHkCxCzM8CW5Ah

Or if it were something that is measurable and verifiable - such as 'Running 10k in under 45minutes' then for your money to be released, you need to link to the verified time that you did it in, from the running events website for example.

Just used the service and really impressed. 
I used  as they were giving away 0.1 to first user to try the service.
Process was as followed:
1. Went to  and chose my nearest payment center by entering my postcode. There were 6 locations within 1 mile of my house, I chose one at end of my road ~1minute away.
2. Uploaded photo of my provisional driving license, they said it may take some time to approve.
3. 9 mins later received email approval of account, and an attatched ZipZap payment slip. Printed this off to take to corner shop.
4. Took to corner shop, guy scanned the barcode, gave him my £20. 5 seconds later he gave me the receipt:  
Along with my payment slip I took in - 
5. 4 minutes later the money showed up in my bitcoin account: 
6. Throughout the process there was a URL that was emailed to you to check the state of your order:
Couldn't be more impressed with the service start to finish, really easy and quick.
Few thoughts - Markup wasn't as bad as I thought, it was a base £1 charge, then they tell you estimated price per BTC. At present the site states £341.82 GBP per BTC, going off bitstamp &amp; google actual price is £334.39 per btc. Best price on localbitcoins is £335.42 so for the ease of not linking your bank account or having any SEPA bank fees etc I think this is a very good option.
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:33:19
 
is best since you're in UK. Should be pretty self explanatory on the site.
You set up a sell price for the .5btc (look on preev.com for rough price to go for) &amp; transfer the btc into your local bitcoins account. They go into the sites escrow. Other person sends you money via bank transfer online, you release bitcoins to them.
You have regular pounds

Thanks for the review! 
So to get things straight, currently it cost £141.38 using Western Union, and £142.94 through Rebit.ph using bitcoin.
That represents a 1.1% extra fee. 
However that also includes the cost of purchasing the bitcoins through exchanges which also take a fee. So if you already have btc it would likely have been cheaper.
What about delivery times? Is western union instantly available? Was the money instantly available through Rebit?

You raise excellent points, and you are correct that I was mainly referring to fractional reserve systems, and in particular the problems you raise with the way banks use someone elses money to lend it to you etc, all this interdependence strikes me instinctively as wrong. 
I understand that many people will be pro credit, and can see the benefits as exampled with car dealership. It's probably just my inner mind working/logic brain that I simply don't agree with the way it currently works, person X buys a car on credit, becomes reliant/in debt on Dealership Y. Dealership Y doesn't actually own all the cards, so Dealership Y become reliant/in debt to Car Maker Z.
Its just passing the buck on, and you end up with almost everyone in a web of debt/reliance on other people, some people will think thats a good thing, personally I don't, I'd prefer it if I had to save up for my car, go and buy it from a dealership that completely owns the car, then it is mine, no reliance/debt passed on.
But you're far more smart than me and can explain everything you mean far better than me. Good post.

You want honest feedback, and kudos to you for matching donations, good of you to do.
Personally though, I disagree with most of the views that Amir &amp; fellow dark wallet creators share. I don't have utopian views, I don't believe in complete freedom and feel we do have a responsibility to think of both pro's and cons, such as what negative effects complete privacy can have on the world. It seems that most of the contributors seem the world as a terrible place at the moment, an 'everything must fall' type scenario, when I'm almost the opposite and feel that bitcoin can enhance the world without having to tear it apart first.
Massive respect to you and all the Dark Wallet crew for their hard work to something they believe in.

I'm pro bitcoin, but you just ignored the guys point and waffled about something else. There is almost no way for someone that doesn't believe to short it to receive FIAT if/when it fails (which they think it will), the services currently for shorting pay in BTC as far as I'm aware.

Just figured it out, you need to have 'city' filled in your personal info. 
Also a slight problem/tweak I'd make:
1. You can't change your address once set up. I only put in the number of my flat, not the street name, and now I can't add the street name as its an uneditable text field. 
2. When doing the 'search' option for local payzone places, I'd advise searching with just the postcode, otherwise search results aren't showing with address &amp; postcode.

Fwiw I'm not down-voting any of your posts, I like rational explanations, even when I'm likely to be wrong.
I agree given the example yes then for you taking option B) results far better as mentioned. The problem is getting the safe option, and stopping the person that has lent you the money, from lending out more money than they actually have - which has happened in the banking world. 
Theoretically, in the bitcoin world if credit were wished to be set up, there could be complete proof of reserves, which would mean at least then you could verify the person that has lent you the money, that you are repaying has the money in the first place and that they can't suddenly do a Gox and be like 'woops lent more than we had on paper'.
Vice-versa though, the person/company lending you the money is also taking a risk lending out the money, which is presumably why you would want credit ratings, so that you can prove you are trustworthy and reliable more than random person A. But by saying this then you are saying random person A has a set % amount of chance to default on their repayment plan, leaving the person/company lending the money out, out of pocket, or them reposessing the house, and person A out of the money they had currently spent. 
The person borrowing the money is out looking after number one, the person lending the money is out looking after number one, both thinking they're getting a better deal. Someone ends up out of pocket, in this example you got a good deal (2k compounded) the lender got a good deal, as person A couldn't repay so they repossessed house &amp; kept the payments till this point. Person A got screwed because he fell behind on repayments. 
Is this person A's fault? Most probably yes, he got into a situation he couldn't keep up to, and has ended up worse out of it. But in the biger scale, if credit wasn't available in the first place then he wouldn't have got himself in this situation. It was the other 2 peoples looking out for number 1 (and his own) that got the whole credit thing created and ended up screwing him over.
Cliffs: imo credit is bad.

It may drop a lot more, but eventually a trustless exchange will exist, will bitcoin go to $10 or so before this happens? Unlikely but possible.

Yes panic is happening. Yes I'm a bitcoin believer/bullish on BTC.
But saying it will go back up soon, don't worry is bad advice. It might not do, so don't make statements you can't backup.

Great news imo, cliffs:
Recap: ZipZap announces launch of global cash for bitcoin service.   CashCoin live in UK next week.
Question: "Did you say hundreds of thousands of locations?" Eric: "We launch first at tens of thousands across the UK, next week."
Recap:  will rollout across hundreds of thousands of locations in 2014. Buy bitcoins with cash. Realtime. Convenient. Safe. ZipZap
You can use  to find the location nearest to you that will accept cash for bitcoin. 
I live in manchester and there are 9 places within a mile radius that accept it. 
Makes it much easier for the masses to adopt imo.

Because my bank account has very little money in it that I just use to pay my bills, but my bitcoin account has more funding in it. So I like to use my bitcoin for as much as possible, simply to avoid completely using up my bank balance and going into overdraft - the hope is one day to go completely bankless.
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:34:32
Although it is free, don't forget that first you would either have to own the coins, or purchase them. Purchasing that many would move the market against you, if the other person receiving them then wanted to sell them to receive $ again they too would have to sell them on an exchange, meaning the price would again go against you (first time buying too high, second time selling too low). 
So although the actual transfer is free once you aquire the bitcoin, it would probably cost you a fair whack in the buying and selling the bitcoin process.

I've got no idea why it wouldn't get many upvotes, doesn't seem too self promotey or 'be all end all', and the fact you're taking feedback is a plus. Maybe try bitcointalk, and of course twitter, and hopefully word of mouth would help spread about it. 
Hopefully it takes off, as I'd love to use it for various things - Giving up take aways, running in under X time, spending Y time a day at work etc.
Good luck

No need to come back so aggressive/snarky. Your coins aren't sure to be stolen without 2FA, in fact, it is pretty unlikely they would be. Unfortunately as mentioned below by Godfree it's likely your email is compromised, or you have a virus on your computer.
Good luck.

IRS Virtual Currency Guidance: Virtual Currency Is Treated as Property for U.S. Federal Tax Purposes; General Rules for Property Transactions Apply  
IR-2014-36, March. 25, 2014
WASHINGTON – The Internal Revenue Service today issued a notice providing answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) on virtual currency, such as Bitcoin. These FAQs provide basic information on the U.S. federal tax implications of transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency.
In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance -- but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.
The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes.  General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.  Among other things, this means that:
* Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.
* Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply.  Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.
* The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.
* A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property. 
Further details, including a set of 16 questions and answers, are in Notice 2014-21, posted today on IRS.gov.

Yes I understand that you believed it was a bubble, and that you can predict that something will drop, but timing the top of the bubble? If you still think that the price of $500 or so is far too high, then by logic you would have shorted them at $700 or so on the way up (what if it didnt hit 1,200 and went straight to $300, you'd have missed out on the short).
Decentralising fiat is going to be done in the beginning, unfortuantely through regulation of exchanges, which will be by the end of the year. Thats a problem with FIAT, not bitcoin, with bitcoin the decentralised proof of ownership/existence is easy. 
If you have a problem with anything its with the fact that currently there is no way to prove of FIATs existence, meaning you believe current Banks, will also crash and fail? By your rational...
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:49:08
This is bad that they didn't re-enable 2FA, but if the people had access to your email, and they were deleting the replies from BTC-E where they were possibly asking for more proof, then they can't really do much... 
Getting hacked and not changing your email password is counter intuitive.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:42:53
they can crash the network if they get 50%. That is the SO.

Yes, on btc-e your funds are in a wallet. Just transfer them to your havelock wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-24 00:33:15
I see you've got no counter argument about the price you started shorting at or why.
User confirmed troll?
Trustless exchange as in, complete proof of reserve constantly, multisig authorisation so that funds in someones accounts/wallets can't be moved/lost without permission from the user.
The real issue would be on the FIAT side, proving that the FIAT money was actually there in peoples accounts etc, but given that issue currently exists in the current banking world, I expect a resolution would be found.

Thought I'd crosspost this from since it seems like such a big deal. Finally no need to use £s to go to asda, can just use my bitcoins to buy a gift card and then use that. Admittedly it's not as good as them natively accepting bitcoin, but its the next best thing right now!

The  Thing to do is make sure your multibit wallet has a long password set on it.

Looks good, some suggestions:
Can't see in FAQ mentions of if funds are stored in cold storage, you need proof of funds imo (to avoid FTP type thing happening).
Show current amount of players logged on in the browser somewhere.

I think that trust based will only take you so far, I mean if I stick 1 btc on me to quit smoking, then don't quit smoking, I'm not just going to let my BTC dissapear. I'm going to be dissapoitned in myself, but then I'm going to tell your site i completed it instead of letting 1btc ($600ish) go down the drain.
Suggestion - How about X of X people need to verify success. So say if at the start I sign up and put my best friend/brother/mother down, for it to be unlocked, both me and my other chosen person has to verify it. Possibly via email? Or they have to also have an 'observer' account. You could take this further, and make it a '3 of 4 people' that have to confirm you succeded, so that people are more likely to be encouraged to stick to their goal.

Really happy to see this available and likely to try it out soon! A few questions though:
1. Why is the limit £300
2. Will the commission always be 7.9% &amp; £3.95 or will this come down in the future as you get more custom?
3. Why do you require govt idea? I think one of the biggest attractions of BTC is the anonymity, so uploading passport or driving license worries some.

I guess I'm being really stupid here, but compared to purchasing say lottery tickets through these stores with cash, whats the difference between that and buying bitcoins in the stores? As i thought both were processed through similar protocols, but with lottery tickets you don't have to let them have your ID on record? 
I also realise bitcoin on its own isn't anonymous, and can be tracked etc, but was going to set-up a new paper wallet to receive cash bitcoin deposits every month or so when I get paid, only cash in, nothing out for no records.

I bought about 15 @ $600-800ish. Sold them all @ $200-350, not because I don't believe in Bitcoin, but because I needed the money. 
So I lost a fair amount of money, knew the risks and still believe bitcoin will succeed, but my financial situation meant I had to sell them. Still hope to see them succeed, but doubt I will own many unless I come into a lot of money.
