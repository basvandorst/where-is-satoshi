Could you please try again? I'm thinking the issue may be caused by low disk space so I added a fix for that. Sorry about these issues, we'd like to iron out as many bugs as possible during beta though.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:52:11
Could you run this test please?  Does it pass?
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:50:46
Hi, I've just tested on Firefox 48 for Windows 7 as well as Chrome (latest versions) and it worked fine. Do you have any browser plugins that could be interfering or are you using a version older than this?  
Could you please open the console (F12 and click console at the top), repeat the process again and let me know if any errors are there? 
I'll get the fraction of a second 'peek' fixed, thanks for pointing that out :)
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:59:10
Thanks for figuring that out - I never thought to test with an empty password field, I just assumed it'd say 'incorrect password' rather than crashing :/
I've added an error message now to all password screens, including this one, if the user fails to enter their password. Going forward, we'll probably change the layouts to make the fields more obvious. We're also working on making the sign up process quicker and less tedious.
Thanks for the feedback, I also entered you into the 'bug report' giveaway entry.

Thanks :)

Thanks. What's your free hard drive space like? I recently had some issues when my hard drive was full with similar errors
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:52:54
Perfect, I'm definitely going to look into using this. I was going to just hard-code the fee into the app but maybe it's better to use an API like yours and get estimates every hour or two just in case the transaction volume surges.  
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-12-21 14:55:57
Thanks for the info. I just tried with maxconnections set to 2 and its still the same.  
Since Google provide a $300 trial, I might clone this VPS to one with more RAM and see what happens.
@_date: 2015-12-20 14:14:03
Of course, stupid me :/  
So maybe a 10-15k fee will be fine for me then.
Thanks :)

I did try setting minrelaytxfee but it only changed by about 1%.  
Which Compute Engine instance type are you using? I've just upgraded from g1 to n1 (both 1 vCPU) and it's much better now; 10% CPU. I simply created a snapshot and used that in the new one, so the configuration hasn't changed.
I am connected to both instances and am running htop, they are actually using about the same amount of RAM, but it seems like adding more fixed it. Or maybe it's just increased CPU - Google does mention that the old one I was using was 'shared'. The documentation doesn't explain it that well, but it seems that one vCPU is a hypherthreaded core and a shared vCPU is half of that.
So it does seem to be better now, although still not as low as yours, so thanks for the help. I'm going to leave it for a while and see what happens, as it only has 10 mins uptime as of now and memory usage is increasing.

Is this accurate? My blockchain data is taking up about 116 GB. Or is this data the compressed size?
@_date: 2015-12-21 12:35:30
No, it's using default settings I think. I'm using Bitcore, but [looking at the code]( it seems that it only sets txindex=1 and JSON RPC credentials.  
Do you think this update will reduce CPU usage from 50% down to about 20%?
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:09:37
Personally, I prefer [BIP108]( It solves all of the problems in BIP107.
@_date: 2015-12-21 14:24:53
Lime 34 of services/Bitcoind.js in bitcore-node is setting txindex to 1. Won't I need txindex enabled to look up transactions though?
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:56:05
Is this only while it's syncing? If it is, you could just limit Bitcoin to 1 core (or maybe two if it's a quad-core i7).
@_date: 2015-12-21 14:32:00
As I said in another comment, I don't think it is using 50%. Htop says that usage is 30% with spikes to 100% every few minutes. Might just be Google Compute Engine dashboard displaying the wrong numbers.  
And htop simply lists the processes as 'bitcored', 16 total. They're the only processes consuming more than 1% CPU.
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:52:52
RemindMe! 728 days "Claim to be Satoshi"
@_date: 2015-12-20 12:22:34
So it looks like 18000 - 22000 satoshi per kB is about right for confirmation in 2 - 3 blocks. Thanks for the link
@_date: 2015-12-21 12:59:41
Looking at the htop process manager, it says that only 20-30% CPU is being used in total and the load average is 0.49 0.44 0.45. It also says that only about 1GB RAM is actually being used.  
However, the Google Cloud dashboard (it's a GCloud Compute Engine instance) says 50% CPU usage. Maybe Google are measuring the load average (which takes RAM into account IIRC) and marking that as CPU usage. So maybe it is behaving nominally?
And it's only listed as 'bitcored' and there's 16 instances of it running. A Node.js process usually only uses one thread.
I'm going to adjust the Bitcoin config now and see if anything happens.

Bitanswers is a question and answer website, similar to Yahoo! Answers or StackExchange, but with a friendly community and good quality answers, created by myself and We have built custom integrated digital currency into the site, with Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin, so that users can tip each other, make withdrawals and deposits, and earn rewards through our promotion:  
**As our September promotion, we are offering $0.02-$0.10 for each answer and $0.05 for each question**, in a digital currency of your choice. To receive these rewards, create an account, click the Cryptocurrency tab at the top of the screen, and click Set Preferred Receiving Currency. Set it on the following screen and then post some answers and questions! *Rewards are given manually, to prevent spam, but they are usually processed within 8 hours, 24 maximum.* We will only reward you for up to 3 answers and 3 questions per day, although we would love it if you posted more - we will soon be building a shop to exchange points for items too.  
We are built on the block.io crypto currency API, so the minimum withdrawal and deposit is just 0.0002 BTC, 0.002 LTC and 2 DOGE.  
We are constantly developing new features, and we would appreciate some feedback. So far, we have given away way over 0.01 bitcoin and 4000 dogecoin and users have posted 135 questions and 204 answers.   
Please sign up, we will be tipping through the site. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:03:39
I have.

Hi everyone,
 
A few weeks ago, and I announced the launch of our new website: [bitanswers.com](
 
We're really excited about this new project.  Our website is similar to sites like Yahoo! Answers and Chegg.  But unlike those sites, ours integrates **bitcoin, litecoin, and dogecoin** tipping to encourage users to provide thoughtful answers to others' questions.  Tipping is completely *optional* — creating an account and using our site is *free*!  But we highly encourage tipping as a way to encourage people to provide thoughtful answers.  For example, if you want to know how far apart the Earth and the moon are, you can ask on BitAnswers and then offer a bounty of $1 or any other amount to get your question answered.  We are hoping that this makes it easier than ever for people to get their questions answered.
 
Anyways, we are here again to announce some exciting news.  **We now have over 750 users!**  When we made our first announcement on Reddit a few weeks ago, we had only 150 users.  Because of the Reddit community's dedicated support, we now have over 750 users.  In just a few weeks' time, we have added 600 new users, which is super exciting!  We hope that this is a signal of more good things to come, and we really thank you for your support.
 
Also, we have made a number of improvements to the site based on your feedback.  First, we implemented a notification system so you know when your questions have been answered and when you have been tipped.  We are also making various improvements to the user interface so that it is more appealing and intuitive.  Furthermore, we have enhanced performance by making our website faster.  Also, the new mobile version of our website is a lot easier to use.  Follow us on [Twitter]( for news regarding future improvements.  Future improvements will include, improved spam filters, bug testing, and a new layout for our notification system. We welcome any feedback from our users since we are always looking for ways to improve.
 
Thank you for your continued support, and feel free to check out BitAnswers.  We hope you enjoy our website as much as we do!
 
Stay tuned for more to come!

Hello everyone, 
During the past couple of weeks,  and I have been quietly working together to bring the online digital currency community a new and exciting platform.  We believe that this platform will fill a gap and solve common frustrations. 
**Have you ever been in a situation where you need a tough question answered ASAP?** Maybe, you skipped class one to many days and Yahoo! Answers does not have the answer to your math problem. Or maybe you did go to class but you would rather not pay for a monthly subscription on Chegg.com. Maybe you’re only willing to pay someone $1 or $.25 to answer your question. 
BitAnswers.com is the solution to your unique and urgent situation. On our platform, you have the option to **post a question** and **tip** users who are willing to answer it. You can tip them in bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin.
You ask, why use BitAnswers.com? For starters, BitAnswers is *specifically built* for your questions and answers. Think of BitAnswers as a blend of Yahoo! Answers and TaskRabbit.com.  Except, instead of offering people money to complete your tasks, you can offer people digital currency to answer your questions. However, we also encourage questions without a reward, maybe you wish to ask questions to the crypto community, about anything. *Posting a question or answer is totally free, and tipping is entirely optional*.
The above example highlights the frustrations of not having an answer in an academic setting. However, **you may ask and answer questions for anything and everything, not just limited to digital currency!**
Expect an abundance of new features such as a ratings system and a rewards system with cool swag, among other features. Also, as an added incentive, we are working on a system to reinvest 20-50% of our Google ad revenue in our users for liking statuses, answering and asking questions, posting comments, etc. In short, we hope to reward you **FREE** dogecoin, bitcoin, or litecoin! An elaborate point/reward system is in the works so you can expect free goodies, too! This means free pins, stickers, mugs, and t-shirts! 
  
**We are giving away bounties in dogecoin, litecoin or bitcoin for posting questions and answering questions, just set your preferred currency in the Cryptocurrency menu at the top of the screen after signing up, then wait for us to send the reward.**
Please feel free to show and me some love by signing up and helping us go to the moon! 
Also, *we are looking for programmers to join our team, experienced in php, mysql and javascript.  Please email us if you’re interested: contact 
We will now be answering any questions or suggestions that you may have! Expect tips from us also, through the site.
Thanks for reading! :)
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:18:33
Thanks for letting me know. Just tried on Firefox for Windows and that doesn't work either. Will fix it right now. [In the meantime, here is a sign up link](
@_date: 2014-10-17 15:27:34
Sorry for the inconvenience. I will send you a tip on the site once my deposit goes through if you answer some questions. Thanks.  
EDIT: You weren't being a "dick". Thanks for telling us that it wasn't working correctly.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:55:55
Does anyone know if it's coming to the UK? Newegg just launched over here and I doubt anyone really uses them since it costs loads to ship stuff over here, but it would be nice to have the BTC option anyway.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:06:23
Problem is, we use litecoin and dogecoin as well as bitcoin. Using ChangeTip for just bitcoin would be messy.
@_date: 2014-12-07 15:12:30
I believe the main guy behind it (paraipan) passed away a few months ago.  
His profile on bitcointalk:   
Before it was shut down by the other developers (I assume), it was quite popular.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:08:14
That's for users who have just registered. After answering a few questions, it would be lowered to about 2-3%. However, we will consider lowering it in the future once we start making a profit. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 20:40:03
People are upvoting posts and downvoting yours, this must be because they disagree with you. Please stop this, and be nice to people. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 09:39:16
Mainly ads at the moment, 2 on each page. We also charge a small fee for transactions, [more info here]( We will probably lower the rewards in the future to ensure that we get enough income to pay for server costs.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:20:07
Dogecoin is no longer considered a joke coin and their users have been very helpful on our site. We have no plans to add any more coins though.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:21:03
Fixed.   The # was missing in &lt;img usemap=" in the HTML imagemap. Chrome works without the hash, but not FF.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:18:04
We have decided to change it, to a maximum of 3%. Thank you for your feedback. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:30:51
I think it's only accepted in the US also - Newegg have just started selling in the UK and Australia, but don't accept bitcoin there yet.
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:10:56
Me and made it. Thanks for the feedback, we just changed color scheme yesterday, so we're still working on the UI.
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:16:40
Thanks for contributing to the site! 
@_date: 2014-12-07 16:36:56
Just looked here, he indeed is. He was very active on the forum.


@_date: 2014-11-02 13:50:50
Hello! Me or have posted here before, but we have just released a new feature which we hope will encourage high quality answers and extra visibility for questions where one is set.   
Our site is [BitAnswers.com]( a **question and answer site for all topics, not just limited to digital currency**. We have over **900 users**, and over **600 answers** already. Our site has many active users who make the community, in general, very friendly.   
When you ask a question, you have the option to set a bounty, which is paid to the selected answer, which you choose yourself. Minimum bounty amount is $0.01, and it is paid to the answerer's preferred currency, BTC, LTC or DOGE. You can choose which to pay in also. 
As well as these bounties, we also have tipping, where users can tip each other for their questions or answers with the built in Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin wallet. This feature has been around for about two months. We built our own platform for this, where transactions are conducted off the blockchain, for instant transfers, without high fees. The minimum withdrawal is just 0.00002 BTC - we use the [block.io]( API for deposits and withdrawals. 
As well as earning from bounties, both me and are actively tipping users, so please join!
Link: [
Thanks, and please leave some feedback on the design, bounties, tipping, anything!
