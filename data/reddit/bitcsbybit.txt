The final destination of the initial 300 was 1FL488btzV244B5dkCTL6PZruJ9Di7AtT9
That address had 20,000 BTC until December when it made the top 100 addresses with most bitcoins. 
Bitcoins were moved after that in smaller batches. 
Edit: typo. It was top 100.
Edit 2: Have you bought any BFL products? I see some of the change from the 300 going to the potential BFL wallet address: 1KhHvmZXxqGRA821Rsqcs6FF2EwLsddrSX

It will be unworkable if it is for each transaction, like buying a coffee, tipping someone, etc., same as it would be unworkable if you needed to keep records for each cash transaction.

There is no reason for current apps not to work. You will be able to install them through F-Droid and probably even through Google Play. For some advanced users, side loading is always an option.
It seems that initially CyanogenMod was going to be used as a base and more phone models would have been supported, but for some reason they moved to ASOP which limits the number of devices that would be compatible.

Three open-source projects have joined together to announce a new partnership to create an open, verifiably secure mobile ecosystem of software, services and hardware. Led by the work of the Toronto-based CopperheadOS team on securing the core Android OS, Guardian Project and F-Droid have joined in to partner on envisioning and developing a full mobile ecosystem. The goal is to create a solution that can be verifiably trusted from the operating system,  through the network and network services, all the way up to the app stores and apps themselves. Through a future planned crowdfunded and commercial offering, the partnership will provide affordable off-the-shelf solutions, including device hardware and self-hosted app and update distribution servers, for any individual and organizations looking for complete mobile stacks they can trust.
CopperheadOS is a hardened open-source Android based on AOSP, that is available for download and installation on many Nexus devices. The Guardian Project develops popular free and open-source privacy-enhancing apps like Orbot (Tor for Android), ChatSecure, and ObscuraCam, and software libraries like NetCipher, SQLCipher and PanicKit, for developers who want to enable similar features in their own apps. F-Droid is an installable catalogue of free and open source Android software, that is built into CopperheadOS, as the default app store. It enables decentralized and verifiably secure app distribution by any individual or organization.
Edit: Also, I should have mentioned that this would be especially good for anyone using SPV wallets on Android as it would be somewhat more secure.

The article is angled as if Bitcoin is right wing and against "free" west, which is wrong as Bitcoin is apolitical.
