98 times out of 100 a cease and desist letter are outright posturing in the hopes that their business rivals tuck their tails between their legs and run. One percent want cash for showing you to the door (looks at Getty images) and one percent actually do own a copyright that can be defended and half of them see it as more trouble than it’s worth

So if it is taken as a given why is it a fallacy?
As singular flips sure, but as I said I think it’s missing the forest ( the odds of  51 in a row) because it’s focused on a tree (the singular flip)
@_date: 2018-11-19 08:31:18

Um actually (pushes glasses up on nose) that’s a gambler's fallacy because past probability doesn’t determine future outcomes.  
Also it depends on if you kick him in the knee after the race starts. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:54:59
But if you flip heads fifty times the singular odds are that the coin flip is 50/50 but id wager the odds of a 51’s head flip in a row are a hell of a lot lower than 50/50.     It’s why I’ve never liked the gamblers fallacy idea..... it’s focused on the trees and not the forest. 
Also...... it was a joke (as told but the helpful suggestion to kick him in the knee.)
