My point was it might as well be closed source. But yes I would use a closed source bitcoin. The way I am using bitcoin is already closed source. 
That’s your assumption. But like I’ve already pointed out that can take decades to even happen.

There is no such scale. 
For example, notepad++ a simple text editor had a NSA Blackdoor. You could never know.

No it’s not. It can be open source, match the compiled version, and still have flaws that make it un-trustworthy. You probably think you can catch every security flaw just by looking through the code (you won’t even do this) but you won’t be able to.

I actually agree with you 100%. I’m mostly just playing devils advocate. 
My initial comment was responding to the people who were saying they’d review the code and compile it themselves.

Except it will take decades to find these things like in the case of OpenSSL. No one is going to be checking this stupid app joe nobody made.

How are you defining less secure? Never been breached before?

Complexity does not mean someone can’t fuck up. You’d be amazing how convoluted someone’s code can be if they have no idea what they are doing

I already use closed source bitcoin. I have never looked at the code and every wallet I’ve ever used has been closed source (including my ledger). It wouldn’t make a difference to me.

Except it will take a decade to find these flaws like with OpenSSL and whatever damage will already be done. 
And there are people who have claimed in these comments to wanting to read through the code. 
And clearly you don’t know the stupidity of an amateur developer and their ability to fuck up a system where the environment sets up itself.

People are so full of shit. 
“I will go through every line of code, set up whatever crazy environment it needs to be compiled in, and only run it in a virtual machine. Just to find out if I like it or not”. 
No you won’t. You’ll download it and run it like everyone else. You look for open source because it’s something you heard makes a program more secure somehow.  (Not always the case). 
If he really is using electron there is going to be so many modules that it’d take a month just to comb through. 
I’m not saying that no one does it but the three people in this thread are full of shit
