@_date: 2018-01-01 09:54:43
I just gave it a test, flawless ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:16:14
I've not seen an article staying that you will be able to buy/sell bch on coinbase, only that they will be allowing people to withdraw their BCH from the fork...
I could be wrong.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:14:58
What website is this?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:46:21
I think you might have taken this comment the wrong way...
Dingbat is a very harmless, friendly term used for someone who made a silly mistake (in Australia)
Bless your Mummas cotton socks, aren't old ladies cute! :)

Our children will thankfully never know this pain...
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:38:11
Thank god! Please sort it out and help BTC return to what we need it to be :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:03:20
Well...there you go...
Also this, posted 55 minutes ago
"Specifically, if your Bitcoin was in your Coinbase Vault at the time of the fork, your BCH will be credited to your BCH wallet in your Coinbase account"

They opened trading on their exchange gdax. Then *people* pumped the shit out of it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:57:36
What's square?
Also, thank for your point of view. I love the sharing that happens here. Brilliant writing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:57:38
So did you get a solution?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:48
Why thank you kind Sir
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:58:01
Got any tsatoshi for my eclair? :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:40:04
Use RemindMe! ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:51:47
I just noticed the same.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:51:13
Yeah, mega cuntish move...
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:26:38
Hahaha, ahhh well, good intentions ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:54:45
Yeah haha. Don't be accidentally buying bitconnect ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:55:23
Bugger.

Thanks mate :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:45:04
Well, someone is cashing in on that URL....
[Martin, you sneeky](
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:00:01
Perhaps some people are concerned about the "infinite" channel
@_date: 2018-06-18 09:43:13
Your comment invalidates your argument...
@_date: 2018-06-11 09:16:35
Link? I can't find it..
@_date: 2019-10-17 06:25:34
Livingroomofsatoshi for aussies

Hmm, this seems like something that a lot of people would really appreciate in a wallet...
I honestly know many people who won't spent their crypto cause "I paid X and it's only worth Y now"
If it auto bought on spend this would remove this psychological barrier I reckon.
Thanks for the ideas though. Any suggestions on trading bots?
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:06:55
100% legal.
Home unoccupied pulling power with intermittent visitation.
Probably grow house.
Coppers can enter without consent.
Asking for consent would be stupid, cause of it WAS a grow house...what do you think would happen?
@_date: 2019-02-01 08:32:29
I would like this also
@_date: 2019-02-19 08:47:34
Hahaha, same but different I guess ;)
@_date: 2019-01-01 11:48:54
Tipping is in sats, gotta be 10 or more
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:04:53
About fucken time!
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:48:40
Honestly though, why is this process not automated?
I mean, who wants a full wallet that they can't receive funds into?
Ain't no one planning on ONLY spending their bits.
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:51:19
Sadly that is currently part of the problem, but we are moving in the right direction.
Soon, the monkeys will also be able to transact ;)
@_date: 2018-12-22 02:46:02
Me too hahaha
