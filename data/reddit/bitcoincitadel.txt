True. Republicans are Christian and Hillary invented pedophilia. When a Republican Christian becomes a victim of pedophilia (not the actual victim but the pedophile), it's because of democrats and Hillary. Voting against him would approve of pedophilia/Obama.

Thing is /btc has multiple motives: pump alts, ver wants control and they even praise buttcoiners. If they really wanted Bitcoin to succeed we'd respect them
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:53:56
I doubt jihuan is dumb enough to fork without scamming ver to make it up

Yes use a txt record
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:52:02
What they do is a pump and dump, once you buy they dump the price
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:43:14
They're the best
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:20:52

@_date: 2017-03-19 03:06:17

Yeah but what's your solution? ... I hope ver buys ethf and goes bankrupt
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:20:20
Oh I did not see last year, numbers get blurry when you hodl during tough times
@_date: 2017-03-22 09:18:25
They'd have to fork and leave
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:32:23
Bitcoin is a Bitcoin killer
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:12:00
Yeah don't hodl but if you're desperate to freeze your usd it may work
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:45:48
Haha you got all the cucks
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:02:37
Probably because we already know
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:17:09
bot nets, never mind, we can't do cpu or gpu. But a new asic algorithm could fuck them for a year and reset the playing field
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:07:51
If you don't have much sure it might be relaxing otherwise you'd move the market
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:18:20
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:20:15
They can buy they'll be punished by making all their miners worthless
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:01:02
You can use shamir and split it
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:21:19
Yeah but go to gdax for cheaper fees, same login
@_date: 2017-03-29 18:23:54
Who will hodl a certain chain
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:42:22
No hence why we have ddos
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:02:01
Lol I'll never use a shitcoin with a president
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:13:01
Funny those imbeciles complain about centralization, now they can kiss the feet of jihuan and ver
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:18:03
If you mean ethf is the opposite of bitcoin: unlimited supply, bankers, forks, centralized, pos. It's up to you
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:54:21
Armstrong pumped it to 4k I'm sure at coinbase
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:00:12
And wasn't Gavin trying to be the president? 
@_date: 2017-03-21 01:27:59
They shouldn't have gotten your password or otp tho, your email isn't that private
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:49:31
He just wants to be liked
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:13:25
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:22:05
He does controversial things but doesn't put it in core, I fully respect him
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:12:19
It will kinda, the transaction is relayed and nodes don't know who saw it first
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:25:43
Both are fine
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:37:41
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:15:14
The sec can order them to do certain things like choosing a fork, it would've been good for the sec and gives them authority
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:26:19
No because their hash has to stay at bu or we can attack them
@_date: 2017-03-23 11:08:50
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:54:05
Nah they won't check, use the basis of the price you received them at
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:46:24
An hour or 2, you'll see it pending, backup your wallet
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:18:35
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:31:45
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:56:58
Lol you got all the ver cucks
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:17:22
Idk I think the value starts changing immediately
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:04:14
Let it bounce as a last resort, only leave $50 tomorrow morning. Also good job avoiding the eth pump and dump
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:29:45
Also true which is worse
@_date: 2017-03-26 13:19:04
Mow delivers
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:22:42
Honestly in my opinion ver is trump
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:30:54
Where are they getting lent coins from? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:45:01
Many use the team speak
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:56:34
He's telling ver to increase his bribes
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:11:27
Every site is like that
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:24:07
True but to get her to come over
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:56:22
I guess it's better
@_date: 2017-03-21 03:16:48
Propaganda, ver wants control
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:44:40
Coinbase works fine
@_date: 2017-03-21 23:47:32
Please ver sell all bcc
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:16:15
Tether is ok if it's backed
@_date: 2017-03-31 12:24:39
Armstrong lol
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:25:02
That's not really how it works, it's time and statistics vs actual power. We'll take more time
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:47:50
Found the shill
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:29:12
Ok I'll check closer but they don't put it there, if you enter it don't leave your computer
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:40:26
Not that bad
@_date: 2017-03-21 09:10:38
So bu transactions will cost more, ver lies to his people to get control. Jihan needs to realize he'll lose it all if we switch pow or price collapses, he seems to have the same dumb ego as ver.
@_date: 2017-03-19 08:45:13
Absolutely, I'd dump and leave all crypto permanently as I refuse to shitcoin either. I'd be sad because I'd be back to fiat
@_date: 2017-03-24 05:32:38
Then we can change the algorithm
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:52:41
You'll download btu
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:07:50
Yeah it's ridiculous, bu will limit block size, trump cancels meals on wheels and pbs. But screw blockstreamcore and obummer for trying to help us
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:12:50
Vitalik is the king of forks
@_date: 2017-03-20 09:38:10
It's not needed yet, segwit isn't lightening
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:13:47
Whalepool is anti btu, ver will lose
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:21:20
Use a real wallet then
@_date: 2019-03-17 08:46:40
I'll take Bitcoin UBI
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:20:37
They're very legit
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:22:31
Ver cries a lot, like literally

@_date: 2017-03-27 13:44:19
What wallet
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:32:53
Because half of people's computers will start overheating and they'll blame bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:18:45
We need to let off steam but it'll die down
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:16:12
It's going to be experimental for months
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:21:32
Mow is always on point
@_date: 2017-03-17 07:11:19
Those are trolls posting
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:09:29
No you'd tell by block time, there's no other way to measure hashing
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:42:30
Ddos come from millions of infected computers that get bigger by the day
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:11:11
They're probably a scam

There's headers
@_date: 2017-03-17 04:23:58
It's sad ver does this for ego and power vs what's best for the community *and* himself. Also funny you're censored over there
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:44:35
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:19:10
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:38:24
What's the enforcement date? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:03:39
We can't
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:45:08
He worked for the exchange more and he just retired
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:39:19
Vitalik can run any code and fork he wants, users go along with it since they don't care
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:24:36
Yeah they're trash
@_date: 2017-03-23 00:03:08
Yes Luke has his beliefs but he doesn't push them. He even made Bitcoin knots which still respects the network
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:34:12
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:45:39
How about .150

Coinbase shills ethf and wants to hurt btc
@_date: 2017-03-25 08:21:15
We can have north Korea declare war on them

Ach is slow, wait a bit
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:46:41
They already elected president Clifford
@_date: 2017-03-29 12:34:22
You can order the etf to do things with their coins like dump a certain fork, if the etf is big they can have hundreds of thousands of coins. Or order them to only buy aml coins, etc
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:17:50
Lightening is for more causal users anyway, segwit also gives us real bigger blocks

He'll have 100%, he's even split his pool to make it look like he doesn't

Yes we can do better

Standard Bitcoin is a gui
@_date: 2017-03-27 14:58:10
At btc they praise stolfi, they're all anti Bitcoin. Etherium is also the opposite of bitcoin, unlimited supply, forks, centralized, 100,000,000 tokens so far, pos

@_date: 2019-03-25 09:38:31
He keeps leveling up
@_date: 2017-03-21 05:00:24
Yup we can easily fire them, they forget their place sometimes
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:45:31
Can we send poker Travis
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:16:25
There's a lot of bitcoiners in israel, find a meetup and they'll help her
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:04:55
She's paid by the dash scam

You can't right now

You a botanist?

If true, enjoy infected binaries
@_date: 2019-03-03 16:35:26
At&amp;t owns them
@_date: 2017-03-23 01:24:37
We'd have to right? Otherwise even with a fork, we'll still not have segwit
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:53:30
Because you're a purchased account and you promote a scam
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:13:47
Put a ring on it then
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:42:50
Hmm I guess those need massive vmem
@_date: 2019-03-05 10:53:21
I like this one 
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:43:37
I think it would feel nice
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:07:31
These sites are fake usually
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:55:50
He's telling ver to increase his bribes
@_date: 2017-03-26 04:39:31
At the bottom 
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:21:58
I'm euphoric he'll be gone for good
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:26:07
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:39:42
Even less worried
@_date: 2019-03-24 02:39:43
Well it's true there would be more Satoshis but everyone holding would also instantly multiply. Try that with fiat
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:11:05
@_date: 2019-03-11 07:09:18
Ver is shilling for them currently, they have a deal
@_date: 2017-03-18 08:16:27
bot nets, never mind, we can't do cpu or gpu. But a new asic algorithm could fuck them for a year and reset the playing field
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:13:51
We'd be right back to pooling
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:39:16
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:40:19
@_date: 2017-03-18 07:07:11
It's possible, miners could fuck themself if they continue this, I think Luke already wants to change it
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:13:43
But it depends on who the beneficiary is
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:27:37
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:12:17
It works
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:14:02
Not if the price decreases and only for 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:16:50
Where are they getting lent coins? 
@_date: 2019-03-30 04:38:27
But today is good
@_date: 2017-03-21 06:32:44
Because we want to be nice to miners, they're part of our ecosystem unless they start fucking us
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:29:31
Yeah but cashing out will change your value if you trade one for the other? So I guess only splitting doesnt change then ok
@_date: 2017-03-22 11:42:59
President Clifford

You won't pay taxes on $3k of income

No it's that only Bitcoin can break the law and before Bitcoin there were no criminals
@_date: 2019-03-23 08:06:18
Ver has gone full retard
@_date: 2019-03-29 04:18:12
What gains
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:26:54
Someone tried gpu and fpga
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:56:46
It should be on a second layer, not off chain however. Why? Because the blockchain will store your transaction for centuries to come, we'll all store petabytes of coffee transactions.
 I'll donate disk but constantly upgrading for coffee seems wasteful. I run multiple nodes and one had to get pruned, and 3 had to be turned off because of the size. I had to buy big terabyte drives for the others and I'd like them to last.
@_date: 2019-11-25 01:53:39
Beautiful game

Gpg is much more useful aged. So you'd want a copy that's old on your computer. Downloading at the same time won't help much
@_date: 2018-10-20 10:06:22
They're projecting
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:18:04
Damn it I love copay
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:45:51
It should still be potted in the future
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:44:17
This guy just lost people's life savings with his eth pump and dump
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:56:17
And their blocks are taking hours
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:27:48
Do you have the latest armory? Turn off auto turning on Bitcoin then start it before
@_date: 2017-08-02 10:24:13
Bch hasn't had a block in 8 hours, can't even move the shit to dump it
@_date: 2018-10-08 03:27:15
Since the crypto-fastxcxinfo domain is registered by a Russian registrar I figured the scammer likes Putin’s cock… I wasn’t wrong.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:11:44
It means we get more free btc

Clear it, your browser just thinks it's a login

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

Here's what I did:
Move your Bitcoin to a new address, send max to yourself, same wallet new address
Get the private key from the old input addresses, I have armory
Sweep into coinomi, add bch, sweep in menu, I'm not touching the bch client
Now ready to send in my temporary coinomi wallet
Bch hasn't had a block in 10 hours, can't even move it to dump it though
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:13:49
I'll pay $350
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:57:20
Yup they disabled my account too for no reason and want info after I deposited. I lost a lot of money being late to sell bch

@_date: 2017-08-02 13:03:32
No they have no blocks going and exchanges aren't accepting it yet
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:09:31
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:23:39
You have a legacy words, you might be trying the new hd words recovery
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:24:21
They have no blocks, their nodes are crashing, good job ver
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:45:00
Try a base 64 decode
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:00:02
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:20:33
That depends on bch price, if it drops miners come back
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:03:52
Eww fiat
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:24:32

@_date: 2017-08-10 04:02:16
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:42:57
Yes, thanks I'm not crazy, did he lie!?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:17:15
No it is 2x
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:48:18
Nothing just snort some xanax and ignore it
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:09:12
And people tried to cheat them
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:39:50
Works great but needs commas
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:02:55
No you can rebuy
@_date: 2018-10-16 12:55:41
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:49:47
Great idea to offer free hair cuts
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:44:13
Are you lying to me? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:47:52
So he lied? 
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:40:03
Yeah lightening will give them a business, 2x won't
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:54:33
You don't know if they're solvent but yes I've had good experiences but I'd never leave funds anywhere
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:58:42
It'll be here tomorrow
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:33:05
They don't own your keys
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:47:30
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:50:10
I buy a lot, Reddit, fasttech, torguard just this week
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:51:43
Should've used segwit
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:01:33
They do it on purpose to make Bitcoin look bad
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:11:59
Backup -  PRIVATE! 
Public Address
Private Key
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:52:16
They have street money changers
@_date: 2017-08-30 22:41:14
What should I look for
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:20:27
I hold even at a loss because they can't seize my Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:14:28
Where did the letters go
@_date: 2017-08-02 08:24:18
Once we can dump them
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:00:52
Yup he's not leaving us
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:54:25
Yes any amount is possible
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:03:12
No it's np
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:28:37
Nah that scammer sold bch
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:30:23
It's helpful to verify your own transactions
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:55:43
Lightening is instant but it settles on chain later
@_date: 2017-08-20 11:09:07
Well there's heavy attacks and the price is stable so far
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:20:09
How were uasf nodes different then? Are they identical now? 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:50:05
It's not their fault if the merchant got paid already
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:46:19
That's no backup either
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:47:35
No you need the private keys
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:53:57
I plan to keep my Bitcoin in your exchange for safety
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:37:48
They forked and were too incompetent to adjust difficulty
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:44:21
Usaa had it for a while too
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:01:15
Don't tell her! 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:27:14
I use it a lot
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:54:10
Yes .1 btc but it decreases
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:04:17
That's split not sweep. That's only for pre fork btc already on coinomi afaik, after fork/sweep you use a regular bch wallet
@_date: 2018-10-24 23:54:46
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:31:07
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:58:20
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:48:16
I've always used new addresses no problem
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:43:07
Yes that's the point
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:57:29
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:43:16
You could have tiny inputs
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:23:26
Blockchain used to let you import but idk anymore, try it
@_date: 2017-08-30 07:01:42
I swear someone showed addresses that had pie or something like that in them
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:58:05
Same, I'm very serious, I could eat them for life and don't want to pay $50 in ten years with inflation ��
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:56:23
Just wait and don't move them
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:07:50
It's a fake pump, ver is pretending to buy to get others to buy then he'll dump on them, a la Homero
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:36:52
You can get lucky and transact seconds before a new block
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:53:33
I hope they keep pumping until they find a block and I can dump
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:13:42
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:21:50
Never go full ver
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:06:26

@_date: 2017-08-21 12:19:56
I snort then cuddle 
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:32:46
There's hitbtc but they're all shady
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:32:57
Check out satellite based Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:29:59
Yes you own the keys there
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:22:06
The hd fixed much of the bugs
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:36:15
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:52:34
That's slow as shit though and hours of seeking time

You'll be fine
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:10:37
Easy, lizard people moved into their brain cavity
@_date: 2017-08-19 16:21:09

@_date: 2017-08-04 05:54:14
Yup still waiting
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:38:35
No ver left, everything is better now
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:03:27
Congrats ��

@_date: 2017-08-03 09:33:41
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:24:12
Lol no use a different password
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:38:22
Ver was spamming the network, now he's gone
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:50:11
Yeah she's lying bro, hide it and fake lifting weights in front of her or she's going to start getting "headaches"
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:03:55
Most will sweep which is sending
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:44:36
Well you prep coins
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:36:45
Can I deposit btc, add bch then withdraw only btc right now? 
Tried it, bch moved with it :(
@_date: 2017-08-30 08:08:07
I've used that but he said they do it without
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:54:13
Some split inside exchanges
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:24:48
You pay capital gains
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:17:37
No that's address
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:36:34
Mine banned tons

Good luck, there's no blocks
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:43:10
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:09:11
They forked, they should've changed the difficulty if they had any skills
@_date: 2017-08-03 05:27:27
Yup keep sweeping until you get equal bch
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:55:03
Dude I'm getting instant confirmations right now. This shit is amazing with ver gone! 
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:58:17

No it's too late
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:33:56
What's mtp
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:00:22

@_date: 2017-08-03 18:11:36
This is important, so important Firefox and Chrome are version 60.0 because people just think it's better
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:37:58

I hope I can deposit before it's over
Bch hasn't had a block in 10 hours
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:25:10

@_date: 2017-08-04 11:49:30
They feed off hate
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:07:26
I enabled auto sell and I'll take off
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:29:53
No because fiat has chargeback
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:16:04
I'd think so too and most businesses use them for fiat anyway
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:56:48
You can call silbert

I have the same
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:33:28
I'm not affiliated and I don't know how reliable they are. But they are direct icann and I'm transferring all my domains over. Their prices are what I usually pay as a promo on namecheap without increasing.
They run these tlds which I dislike, I'm not a fan of the million new domains but whatever 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:22:46
You can sms the transaction out
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:51:57
Yes but only few exchanges did it and you couldn't tell
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:41:15
Yeah wtf
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:50:34
Yes that's what I did
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:19:51
Yes it's the point of Bitcoin

Yup I just made 1 btc. I don't trust them much but I did get my btc. I wish I can get the bittrex price :(
@_date: 2017-08-11 22:01:37

They buy a coin cheap then pump it with the fund, very simple and worthwhile
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:07:10
Needs more particle.js
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:57:06
It will be a fractional reserve just like tether

@_date: 2017-11-18 20:04:51
Coinbase will do anything they can to make Bitcoin look bad
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:01:32
Interesting but not a bug or exploit. Just theft from an insider. Nothing to do with anything
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:08:56
He gets speaking fees and it's his passion
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:59:07
Legacy, segwit would be half the price
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:06:09

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:26:40
Sure. The bcash owner ver is a criminal and anything with him should be avoided. Also, craig wright is on the team and claims to be Satoshi. They're scammers.
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:33:55

You don't have to move them, but using coinomi for everything might be convenient. 
That doesn't matter because it'll be a new transaction, just get a receive from coinomi
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:40:35
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:30:36
So Bitcoin would be dead now had they been in charge
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:08:23
No it means Bitcoin was bought with fake money
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:00:16

@_date: 2017-11-28 07:35:51
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:55:50

Do you want to use coinomi instead of block? If so yes use.a new address there. Sweep isn't transfer but similar. Add those coins, then in the menu, there's a sweep function. The old private key would be in your block.io. Sweep only after the Bitcoin transaction confirms. Backup the coinomi seed good

@_date: 2017-11-11 11:57:15
It's serious
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:50:23
He's right about bch though. The bcash owner ver is a criminal and anything with him should be avoided. Also, craig wright is on the team and claims to be Satoshi. They're scammers.

@_date: 2017-04-17 17:00:39
They'll do well with crypto only, it's a traders exchange not an exchange usually used for fiat. Polo does well like that. Fiat is a headache.
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:38:21
No the debate is whether letting miners control block size when smaller blocks are better for them. Afaik bu would create smaller blocks but the propaganda hides this with brain washing. So you'd have to model humans

@_date: 2017-10-11 19:16:13
It's the same as bitpay, but it's safe since you own the private keys, it may not be easy though

My eye doctor heard of it and without mentioning it, he called me a Bitcoin hacker, he knew I'm a programmer and jumped to that. He actually put it in my medical record "can hack into bit-coin sites" which is funny but bad.

And... It's an ico
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:54:24
In this case, they're making 2x default so you could lose Bitcoin if you send and don't split. This time it's harder.

Same I never got paid, ver lies
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:24:10
So basically this guy is forking bitcoin, causing contention between miners, etc, and now is making a new coin that allows him to profit from that contention?
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:25:06
No one will realize it but less will be for sale and less will panic dump
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:27:06

You'll have to wait and see what most people keep paying with
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:41:51
Not sure, but since you have private keys it doesn't matter. You can use other tools
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:19:03
How many more shitcoin will ver create

@_date: 2017-10-26 11:26:43
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:13:10
Not fully true, they don't have your private keys
@_date: 2017-10-04 11:41:59
That's cuz it's an attack
@_date: 2018-07-01 06:16:01
He also has the seed to your wallet
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:37:29

@_date: 2017-10-09 02:52:15
The same trust goes into those though
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:13:40
To dump on his followers just like he lied about buying bch
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:43:46

Look at replay protection
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:08:02
Great way to get your account frozen
@_date: 2017-10-11 11:16:04
@_date: 2017-10-07 10:30:38
Ok if I send without replay protection, the same transaction will happen on b2x right? So what's the loss? Say I owned the address, I'd have the private key there too right? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:36:02
I've had perfect service
@_date: 2017-10-09 09:10:47

Is this eth crap
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:03:56
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:27:15
So where's the coins now
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:43:26
So when you have your keys, you can use other tools. You can still get your bch. move your coins to a new address then import the old private keys into a wallet with bch support.
With 2x. Things are harder because of no replay protection
@_date: 2017-10-31 06:56:19

They don't have bch, doubt they'll have b2x
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:52:23
Yeah that was my goal
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:58:35
Core is many people, 2x is 2: ver and jihan. That's centralized

@_date: 2017-10-22 05:07:39
They're pro 2x so i doubt it
@_date: 2018-07-31 23:11:55
That's cheap
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:13:09
Yes but no need after the fork

No doge is perfect
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:45:57
You don't need it all ready to use
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:32:12
When do you know for sure
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:23:46
Wait for a dip
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:41:59
Where do you buy kids for $1?

@_date: 2017-05-14 16:25:44
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:55:45
Maybe the price just went up..
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:30:40
I like copay
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:26:38
Gemini auction
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:16:55
Pretty risky with schools and hospitals closing

@_date: 2017-05-27 18:10:01
Contact the miner
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:31:30
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:23:38
Shut it off then search for wallet.dat
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:51:30
They hash the password. Copay may be safer though
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:09:16
Yes but there's no reason not to use it, some may not use lightening which is different
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:15:48
Is it websocket
@_date: 2017-05-11 08:31:32
Well it's always good
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:57:33

No you can have both, 401k is employer and ira is personal
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:27:24
Best method to distribute them

Ico bro, pump and dump
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:16:30
Is it Homero? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:05:59
Joinmarket is the only safe method
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:06:24
Absolutely a good hedge
@_date: 2018-04-08 11:01:47
How exactly are you stopping cobra from changing dns of your sites
@_date: 2017-05-07 06:41:03
Armstrong loves centralization and ver
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:34:10
There's tons and you can watch them close after a while 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:05:23
It keeps going up that's how
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:46:25
A problem I see is that all the hype is enterprise eth which isn't what people are buying
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:11:55
Pump and dump once people figure out the real use is on enteth not the eth they're buying
@_date: 2017-05-07 20:32:54
He resigned like a bitch
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:07:23
They do now
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:31:47
Can you expand? 
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:10:45
No I'm not excited
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:29:42
It's pretty maxed, they need things like asic boost
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:29:12
  you'll have to test yourself with small amounts
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:37:30
It stores the keys
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:23:57
Litecoin has no processing issues with low use
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:00:23
Credit cards are soon going to be first 
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:05:33
Copay is best
@_date: 2017-05-31 11:28:24
There's many online banks
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:39:22
You sign it offline
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:24:12
Capital gains are very cheap
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:27:45
Not excited
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:23:42
No it's not possible, the combinations are beyond human understanding
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:10:16
No gains are personal
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:25:42
In the future things like liens and divorces will try to find yours
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:58:15
No one believes me but many thefts are from the person closest to you
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:57:33
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:34:35
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:09:40
You only get $3000 capital loss if you have no other gains
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:27:15
They might think you're hacking
@_date: 2017-05-12 16:31:07
I hope they find and execute these criminals
@_date: 2017-05-11 22:32:18
Yeah hodled 6 years for nothing
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:08:31
Fuck turkey and syria
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:06:10
Wow you guys project a lot 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:15:06

Vitaliks scam is over
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:03:06
You just print the qr code
@_date: 2017-05-22 19:29:21
Complete fraud, it'll disappear soon with your money
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:07:52
Yes they use bots
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:04:31
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:52:24
You're supposed to be slain
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:04:08
No it would help them
@_date: 2017-05-20 10:19:33
Now try making a node using a nodemcu
@_date: 2017-05-20 20:01:23
So 800 billionaire? 
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:27:36
That's not how it works, they get the money from buyers
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:35:48
What's cumming like
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:14:48
It doesn't block blocks tho so it's not a fork
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:47:47
@_date: 2017-05-14 12:06:29
Yes potentially
@_date: 2017-05-14 05:20:56
I wish
@_date: 2017-05-20 00:27:53
Look boys, now that we're rich we need to also be fit
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:50:35
We could have done it on mother's day
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:31:49
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:38:52
Much better looking than Vitalik
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:56:18
And pink coin
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:06:12
There's cash advance fees probably
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:22:18
Not with that attitude
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:54:11
They ded
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:31:06
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:57:17

@_date: 2017-05-03 06:12:36
Have your guardian empty your bank account
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:29:36
1 closure is permanent dude, you can't just try again
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:38:28
Oh then 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:02:15
That's not the wallet if he has many inputs
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:14:13
It displays the price
@_date: 2017-05-12 14:32:38
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:42:15
I doubt he entered yet
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:55:01
Copay wallet sells you gift cards

National but you can wire then ach see
Unfortunately, your bank is not supported by our instant verification system. In order to verify your bank account and link it to your Gemini account, you will need to first complete a wire transfer into your Gemini account. Once your identity information is verified, you may transfer USD in and out of your Gemini account by navigating to Transfer Funds. We will credit your Gemini account $20 to offset the wire fee you may incur from your initial wire.
After your first successful wire deposit, you will have the ability to set up bank transfers (via ACH).
@_date: 2017-07-05 05:20:10
I love Gemini
@_date: 2017-05-07 09:57:11
They're imbeciles
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:38:33

No only bfx and polo
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:22:16
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:25:38
Yes but that has the initial delay. You can buy btc and get the price locked though

I'm building a citadel
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:53:03
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:47:11
Coinbase is a broker, they set the price to an extent
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:15:47
Very good
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:38:30
There's also zika. But it's worth it, I'd just buy 1 helivac contract
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:05:45
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:03:36
Uphold does that
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:58:29

@_date: 2017-05-24 06:17:02
That guy doesn't even matter
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:45:42
They can't steal your coins
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:34:51
Correct 
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:39:04
I wish exchanges would give us an idea of where new money is coming from
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:53:31
That coin is for reptile people
@_date: 2017-05-07 04:28:09
More than half at least without banking
@_date: 2017-05-10 22:00:54
Use escrow
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:48:00
But they love centralized eth
@_date: 2017-07-26 07:26:19
You never hold on an exchange
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:45:43
This is probably the best pr we've ever had
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:27:45
Not true, one order would probably be 99% of it
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:10:55
Have you run it? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:05:04

@_date: 2017-07-07 22:51:04
No risk no reward
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:12:30
Urgency is a red flag but also completely genuine, send a selfie with id
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:24:24
They're carded and won't work after a while
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:39:34
No the others just get hyped to trick you into giving up your Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:43:59

The only public face afaik is leaving
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:53:50
Ver is a scammer
@_date: 2017-05-16 16:00:39
Yeah not healthy when price dumping
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:42:34
Stronger together
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:03:06
They don't have one, plus there's ico coins further increasing tokens plus etc plus enteth
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:43:29
Where does ver find these quacks
@_date: 2017-05-02 18:04:30
I doubt it
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:55:28
He's also going full civil asset forfeiture

Not anymore! I wanted a dip earlier..
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:16:04
Add 10 years more inflation
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:59:03
Make  a puzzle like Myst
@_date: 2017-05-16 11:17:58
Xrp is not crypto
@_date: 2017-05-10 07:48:09
Or dump
@_date: 2017-05-14 06:04:46
Yup I loved that post 
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:48:27
It's money, depends on what you're offering in return
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:52:20
@_date: 2017-05-03 06:08:11
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:33:57
No problem. Correct you can do future ach free but Gemini will only do $500 ach per day at least for me. So take advantage of that refunded wire if you want more. Withdraw is $10k ach
Daily Remaining: $500.00
30-Day Remaining: $15,000.00
Need to deposit more than your Bank Transfer (ACH) limits? Wire USD into your account instead
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:45:09
What if they pretend to have Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:39:18
Incredible Bogdanoff
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:39:38
The limit means you need new backup, no real limit
@_date: 2017-05-01 05:54:38
They only thrive in negativity
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:59:47
Well I never have but many did
@_date: 2017-05-19 01:34:29

So they're stealing the shitcoin, /btc will be pissed
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:42:08
No banned is banned
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:35:25
Why are you roaming
@_date: 2017-07-23 08:28:38
They traced it with fiat not on network
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:28:39
Today seems ok
@_date: 2017-05-02 12:11:07
Coinbase is also doing it
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:40:43
Hey bud, ver is against censorship
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:47:57
Premium is insane

@_date: 2017-05-24 12:19:15
He just spammed my email with token sale scams
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:48:46
Bitcoin can't be seized, a very good benefit
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:44:22
it can because it gives the govt someone to jail
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:31:18
You can if you do it before
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:34:32
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:09:34

@_date: 2017-07-14 17:16:35
Which Russia?
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:07:02
Most of that is etherium hype
@_date: 2017-07-25 07:42:08
Fake site already up  Fake
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:01:23
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:39:44
Green is just a marketing gimmick
@_date: 2017-07-30 09:48:35
Yes but paper means it's not on a computer, what you have is a backup
