How on earth anyone can watch Peter, Greg, Adam or any other of the Blockstream guys and claim they are driven by nefarious motivations to gain some sort of bitcoin governance or market share stranglehold is simply beyond me. 
I see benevolent, soft spoken, brilliant scientists and engineers who genuinely love the work itself above all else. Your contributions are nothing short of revolutionary and I hope you guys know that rational observers in this community are eager to help see your exciting visions one day manifest into a practical reality.

You’re right of course and I can see how one could easily become discouraged. I find solace from the lines of Tom Wayman,
*Weak things have power.*
*...only the truly weak are free of*
*the temptation to dominate, harm.*
*That is why democracy is about weakness,*
*why it is to the weak we turn for help*
*when we are beaten, condemned.*
*This is why poems continue*
*like the air*

When I heard of the concept of 3D printing my first thought was it’s a neat idea but the it could be goopy, expensive and something best left for crafty enthusiasts. Never did I think I’d might ever use one until it became clean, cheap and easy, and I’d say my initial impressions weren’t that wrong.
When I heard of bitcoin my first thought (well second thought, my actual first thought was Ponzi) was hey this could really the knife in the heart of immoral banking elite and government corruption if they can make it cheap and easy.
Let’s hope I’m right twice.

In fact the central Bank of England and Bundesbank disagree with you. 
Regular banks create money endogenously first and look for reserves later (sometimes). Fractional reserve money creation based on loaning out a bank’s actual reserve funds is a very common misconception.

I saw Andreas sum it up once in a talk where he essentially agreed with your position that right now, in a western first world country bitcoin is not a better currency than say the USD or a better means of payment than Visa. Therefore adoption will be very slow here.
But the value proposition as bitcoin the currency becomes starkly obvious in parts of the world where their national currency suffers from steep inflation and where access to banking and credit services is non-existent. Bitcoin as a currency instantly makes sense to anyone in Venezuela, Brazil, Cyprus, much of Africa etc...

Your timelines are quite cherry picked and not very analogous.
For example, according to Wikipedia internet video streaming was invented around the late 80’s / early 90’s with Netflix being founded in 1997.
Blockbuster being founded in 1985 reached it’s peak in 2004 but finally went defunct in 2013.
So over 20 years had passed between the inception of video streaming and the disintegration of one of the largest video cassette tape rental company. 
The rest of your examples  suffer from the issues unfortunately.
I agree with your sentiment that a blind faith in anything is foolish. A healthy skepticism leads to better eventual outcomes in all things, crypto currency included.
