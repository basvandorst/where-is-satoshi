Nonsense is right.  You're the shill.  
Also, might want to read this on how "private" Monero is:

Or convert it to Zcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:16:45
Monero isn't private.  Zcoin and Zcash are the only true privacy coins.  Read up on it.

I'm curious how things like decentralized exchanges are going to be dealt with by the IRS.   Those are coming, hard and fast in 2018.
On top of that, will a decentralized exchange require filing an FBAR?

You only hear about the ones that failed.  Obviously, the ones that succeed you don't know about.

Only if it's an international economy playing the money game.  If it's a self-sufficient local economy then Deflation is a good thing.

You didn't ask whether it worked or not, you asked if it existed.   Feel free to use Google next time.

Who's actually surprised?  It's like generating your bank account login using a third party website.  I'm just surprised it hasn't happened sooner!

You're right.  But that just means we need a new version of Monopoly.
I'm coining Cryptopoly.  
Well, not really. :)

In China, Bitcoin buys you.

Looks like all exchanges in China have till the end of this month.  I'm trying to figure out if HK exchanges will be affected, like Bitfinex and Anxpro

Or Zcoin, where the your minted coins have no transaction history.

This is why zero knowledge proofs are so important.

Methinks I could.  But then I'd lose my chance to irritate grammar nazi trolls.
@_date: 2013-12-27 07:07:36
Also, methinks you're not understanding the term "living language". :)
@_date: 2013-11-01 10:56:35
Methinks you're not understanding the terms.  It is more of a commodity.  pluribusblanks explains it well.
