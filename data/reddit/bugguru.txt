It is Fiat. I guess now you would get 3m or  later 5m. Long live Inflation.

Most of the exchanges have apis. All you have to do is collect and the data and middle them. Something like  is doing. Or like

Did anyone found some information about their fees? After a short look i didn't.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:43:41
Recently there is the next push towards another reduction in fees to 0.00001. As far as I tried most transactions get into the next block.

Every BIP32 wallet i guess. At least if you can select the path.
The bad part is, there are not many other BIP32 wallet, are there?
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:42:21
I checked Mycelium for you.
Get the wallet on a phone.
Looks like 6-7 miles away from you user "bujmiv" is selling bitcoins.

You just confirmed that this email-address is actively used. Welcome on the "hot-address" list of the spammer.

I like this wallet. Good job!
Any plans on adding a currency display/conversation for dollar and euro etc.? Would like to see the bitcoinaverage.com api in use. If i want to send someone 5$ i first have to do the math and type in the equivalent in BTC. 
I think this is also a barrier to new user. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 07:11:28
As from the article it seems they didn't got a good reply from the regulators.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:37:03
Beim ersten Kauf werden die Bitcoins 14 Tage im Account gehalten. Das sollte man beachten, sollte man sie für etwas bestimmtes kaufen.

Does 55 stands for SS and you think he its a grammar Nazi? 
@_date: 2014-06-17 21:07:14
Other companys even give discount for paying with it. 1st to get used to it and 2nd. because its cheaper for a merchant. Also the "marketplace" fee is something confusing.
@_date: 2014-06-19 13:05:51
I was like writing a wall of text how you interchange words but i think its better to let you explain what a marketplace fee is. 
So, please explain me what a marketplace fee is. What is a marketplace and who does get the fee and for what reason. Why do you think "marketplace fee" is a good name for that.
And why do you think or write someone should add this fee on top of the sum that get displayed by Bitpay? (Hint: its not ontop it is beside). 
Not a single client that i know does subtract any fee from the scanned or typed amount of bitcoins. So how does it would lead to a "underpayment"? Its more like you try to get 0,0005 (as 0,0001 is standard) more :)
Dont get me wrong, i love to see german retailer (that i buy from) to accept bitcoin. But i would also love to see a good explanation for new user. I mean, you at least tried and put some effort in it but it looks like you didnt understand it. Or you somehow throw all infos in a bag and then put it together blind. 
I hope i can get a public answer to my questions. Even as i criticize much.
I dont want to blame you, i want to enhance your service.
If you want a more private conversation you can pm me. My german is also much better than my english :)
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:48:17
Localbitcoins or mycelium app
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:30:59
Will you include fiat prices from bitcoinaverage.com?
I think it would drive adoption from beginners.
@_date: 2014-12-04 09:02:51
As long as you are on the same bank as the other person is, its fast. That isn't a feature of bitcoin.de or fidor. Still I also think they both doing it right.

Since it is closed, i get more mycelium traffic. Maybe not to bad. A 5th in fees.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:16:30
At least they should, right?
@_date: 2014-08-26 22:11:15
Bitcoin would cost him nothing. The buyers would have paid the fees.
@_date: 2014-08-12 22:07:14
I love BIP32 wallets because the backup is easy as it should be.
But i can not use this because:
\ Only USD as currency - need euro + would love to have bit	coinaverage.com prices.
\ Why does it has to be 2 accounts from beginning? I don't see a need for a 2nd one for me. Why force it?
Admitted  is more cry cry but as i said, i dont see a need for me and without it i could save some "clicks" on send and receive.
Edited: words
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:26:38
It is in fact just asymmetric cryptography. Which is used by both. Its like bitid and bitauth. Its just not used by sites so far.
@_date: 2014-08-28 06:30:16
My guess is that the writer is German. The capitalisation in the headline matches the German grammar perfectly and not just almost :-)
Edit: Mark would have to be non-capitalised. So its also almost perfect.

That currencie selection was a damn fast implementation. Good job!

You mean FIAT in general or just USD? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:52:58
Ja, 14 Tage nach dem ersten Kauf gibt es keine Einschränkungen mehr.
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:01:50
I also avoid them because of their extra fee. I also mentioned it to them that it doesnt make sense and it should even be cheaper as credit cards / paypal.

I got a fresh peppermint tea at Floors and a delicious burger  + beer at Room77 in Berlin today. Happy spending!! Edit: both hold their coins
@_date: 2014-12-09 08:15:11
As long as he spends his bitcoin after it gained these 2% he will be fine. Buy some bitcoin, use it when it gained value, if it lost value you buy some more bitcoins to lower you overall buy price.
@_date: 2014-12-03 17:02:13
Why do you think it will kill bitcoin?

I like this video but i think most videos tell the viewer "its money over the internet". But they don't give the advice for the average joe that it can be send from smartphone to smartphone. Even worse was in some videos "money for the internet". 
The most i know thought they need to sit in front of a computer. They do not need it because they do not shop online.
It's like the comparison with gold but not gold coins which can be carried and paid with.

Hive, greenadress, blockchain.info also have adress books.
But somehow it is against the rule to not reuse an address.

For those who want to try this out look at me and my girl for 5cent/minute. It will be online for the next 10 hours.

Now I have to look at every merchant purchase if they use the ingenico terminals and ask them for Bitcoin. My wife will hate me :)
@_date: 2015-01-10 00:00:37
haha, nice! Still i expected more action after the comeback. Somehow the "nothing happed at all" kind of market feeling is not as entertaining :)
Still its good for the user and bitcoin after all.

Since when did it closed? Where did i miss that information. Last Info i got is that they cannot load more funds into it. But they were able to use funds located in their PayPal account.
To that point it was "equal" to bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:11:42
They can send themself some coins, so you don't know how many fell for them.
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:00:47
Did set up a node as well. I saw a nice "cli interface" some days ago but can't find the link to the github as anymore. It shows the connection count, the last blocks and last transactions and more in a nice overview in realtime. Maybe anyone knows it here.

If it is off-chain, they aren't using bitcoin, or am I wrong?
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:35:44
Thats right, thx. Payment channel are stated separate. Are there other methods for off-chain transactions that are true bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:49:31
I can 2nd that.
