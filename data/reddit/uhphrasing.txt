I use Gemini exclusively because the fee is only 0.25% and cash balance is FDIC insured, I just wish they embraced a few more coins (Ripple would be lovely).
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:52
I don't particularly like Ver, but don't spread lies.
He was selling fireworks. They were basically M80s. Still illegal, but he's not a terrorist..
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:22
Do me a favor and look up relative privation.

Hello Dave!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:44
I think Monero's value will eventually be tied to inevitable regulations on BTC (or crypto in general) and the extent to which they're heavy-handed. Or maybe we'll never get to that point!
I haven't done much research yet on IOTA and XRB, would you mind pointing me towards some literature? What do you think are conservative estimates for their growth in the long-term?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:02:48
It's totally fine and in-fighting like what you're displaying is the problem with the community. Yeah Ver may be disingenuous but in the end the people will pick, just as they've done for all tech competitors through the ages.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:04:55
FWIW - [Capital Gains tax is not really 30-40%, unless you're rounding for the purpose of this comment](
If you cash out before 1 year and 1 day, you'll pay the same rate on capital gains as your tax bracket (provided your gains don't push you into the next bracket). For most people on here I would assume that's 25% - 33% (maybe even 15%).
If you wait until ~366 days have passed, then you'll likely be taxed at 15% (or 20% if you make enough money). And if you fall into the lowest bracket you could be taxed nothing at all.
edit: If you've done REALLY well for yourself, make sure to read into the [NIIT, which is relevant for $200k+ when filing single](
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:21
I think all this infighting is stupid. The market (the people) will choose what they like best, but there's still plenty to go around. There are suspect players EVERYWHERE, it's not limited to crypto. Ver is going to do his thing, but in the end, he can't change mass appeal if it fails to come through.
Just don't let *yourselves* get manipulated by tantalizing fluctuating prices. There is some good advice out here if you wade through the murky waters.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:45:06
oops I actually meant Gemini for all 3, it was late haha
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:20
I'm sure there was some minor insider trading, but all this is seems more like a hug of death to me than anything else lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:07:21


@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:32
But that is infighting. It may not be genuine, but it's certainly 'public'.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:20:39
If they delivered anything but withdrawals, it wasn't ahead of schedule, it was false advertising to support insider trading.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:55
This sub has a chip on their shoulders. Appears to be a bit of a disinformation campaign but I doubt it'll hold. BTC will remain Bitcoin and BCC/BCH will stay Bitcoin Cash/BCash. There's room for both in the market.
I don't own any BCC/BCH but I'll probably buy some when GDAX levels off as Coinbase having access is pretty big mover for the price.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:36:08
Can you explain how it's possible to backup existing funds on a second wallet? Do you setup the second Ledger (eg) as a replica of the other using the seed?
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:52:58

I've only known about Ver for a few months and he does seem like a complete douche
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:56:20
Thanks! What exchanges do you recommend, I see neither are on Bittrex and I’m a bit put off by Bitfinex. XRB seems to be very limited and I could look into Binance for IOTA.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:31:26
hey it's me, you!
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:41:51
Only part of it after my comment (more than this clip), but it was late, I'll watch the full thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:24:44
Gemini is real USD as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:43:16
from what I understand he used bcash (which some people act is like a racial slur) and had him defend himself regarding shill accounts.
Ver is looney
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:12:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:28:14
Why not? That seems kinda silly..is it just so brief that the mouseover can't capture it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:56
I totally get that people have a lot of money tied up in this (and what that means relative to disposable income varies by person obviously) so it's very real for them. But I can't help but feel how self-deprecating it is considering how little **real** awareness there is for blockchain/crypto in the general populace *even* at this stage.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:12
Again, these are words you're generally appropriating (like from the stock market).
Crypto is still the wild west, you're not understanding that. Take the pros with the cons, still plenty of money to be made out there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:27:44
I believe in the blockchain as a technology.
I'm also a person with aspirations and crypto will help me get there.
There's too much cult euphoria going on and 'gang warfare', it's almost laughable.
Is Ver probably disingenuous? Sure. But who cares..these are the early days, nothing has been settled yet..for all we know, neither win in the end..
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:22:11
If you're day-trading it, does that mean you're paying 25% tax each time?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:31
Yeah, it's like the Wild West out here, but some people are acting like they're part of a cult. Paranoia is incredible.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:46:23
ah got it, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:59:56
oh wow, fantastic idea, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:02:14
Some wanted to cash out some at the price of 19k on GDAX while it was 15k elsewhere lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:37:02
It's either FUD or gullible people spreading others' FUD.

Listen to **yourself**..nowhere did say "everyone who posts on is a "fanboy"..
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:21:40
If it drops that low though, something very big happened (like some sort of US regulation). I don't think we're going to swings like that just from normal market action.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:18:25
- 0.25% fees at Gemini
- FDIC insured cash balance
- unlimited bank wires (2 hour processing time if submitted early enough in the day)
edit! meant Gemini not GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:23
It can't be illegal if there aren't laws or regulations against it.

And do you store your IOTA and XRB on exchanges for now?

whoa that's crazy!

Actually I was more pointing out this guy talking in absolutes, not highlighting a meaningless typo (which wouldn't be covered in 'phrasing').
Could bitcoin very well be a bubble? Sure. Definitely? No one can say.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:47
The whole infighting is retarded and self-defeating. I own BTC, I'll probably buy some BCC as well.

Neither Coinmarketcap nor GDAX show it going below $14k though
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:44
And that's fine, because if it is a worse/fluffy coin, then it'll fail in the long run.
Bitcoin was the first mover, I doubt the populace will ever call BCash Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:28
I'm getting a bit more conservative for the time being, but I think ETH is probably the one. Also think Monero will fly up soon.
I think a lot of people confuse the fact that Bitcoin has been around for 8 years with it being mature, but most of the population has never heard of crypto (let alone Bitcoin) and of those who have heard of it I would wager a small subset could even explain blockchain. We're still *very* early.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:09:02


Easily would have never touched GDAX/Coinbase if I knew about Gemini from the start.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:28:18
See how my name isn’t a different color? It’s because I’m not OP
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:20:58
I don't think you made a mistake by buying BTC, but I regret buying my first coins through Coinbase. The fee was huge compared to what I've seen on GDAX and Gemini ***and*** the turnaround for actually getting your coins is incredibly slow in comparison.
Coinbase takes almost a week to get your BTC, Gemini had it in a matter of minutes.

Won't happen.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:48:09
The downside is you can't use those coins to sell to USD if a big spike comes (like when the hardfork was cancelled) or even to transfer to another currency.
I would research Ledger Nano S, I've started to do so myself and it seems pretty intuitive and I'm going to use it to secure all my crypto, it's very well reviewed.
Also when you do eventually transfer out of Coinbase, make sure to do so from GDAX (same system) because Coinbase will charge you a bigger fee.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:11:03
Hmmm I don’t trust the latter since I’m still learning. Cheers, I’ll continue to read up.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:14:48
A) Is it easy/quick to transfer from Coinbase to Gemini? Most of my balance will be available on Coinbase in the next week and I worry that the transaction will take too long and I feel like I wouldn't want it "pending" during the fork.
B) Will it be safe enough to house any BTC balance I have on Gemini during the fork or should I move it to my Ledger Nano S until the dust settles?
C) Will Gemini be able to handle the activity to actually accurately manage any limit buy and sell orders I set?
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:17:41
Bitcoin classic isn't bitcoin from what I can tell, it's a moniker.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:06:44
Trezor and Ledger are examples of cold storage because they're USB devices, right? (**edit:** nvm, found [this page]( that confirms it)
CB = Coinbase ;) (sorry if that's not actually an acronym haha)


and this is because having owned BTC before the fork means that whatever the final result is, I will have that as well and it's just a matter of when I act on it, correct?
**edit 2:** , [this page suggests Ledger will also support it :)](
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:02:25
heh, meat
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:41:55
I set a 5800 limit buy when I woke up Monday morning..never filled :(

@_date: 2017-11-07 13:33:04
What do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:36:40
I'll be happy enough to double (or even triple?!) my initial investment and make some useful cash.
Will need to figure out how to report it for taxes though when the time comes.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:08:50
No worries! GDAX is the exact same thing as Coinbase and actually has a pretty cool dashboard. I'm fairly certain the fees are lower there than on CB itself (I think CB is just more accessible and has more traffic), but I can't tell you absolutely.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:41:20
Won't even drop below $7k..you can't just compare these things like for like
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:25:22

I broke the wall sorry!
also I can’t remember what she said before he replies that haha
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:28:42
I was thinking of a plan like this and that I could achieve it with limit buy and sell orders, so three questions:
A) Will it be safe enough to house my BTC balance on Gemini during the fork or should I keep it on my Ledger Nano S until the dust settles?
B) Will Gemini be able to handle the activity to actually accurately manage the limit buy and sell orders at the thresholds I set?
C) Is it easy/quick to transfer from Coinbase to Gemini? Most of my balance will be available on Coinbase in the next week and I worry that the transaction will take too long and I feel like I wouldn't want it "pending" during the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:52:09
ok :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:32:15
Should I just keep everything in CB until after the fork happens?
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:01:08
Thank you for this explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:04:17
Can you give a brief synopsis about Ethereum relative to BTC? Or perhaps any quality links you'd recommend? I'm just trying to digest as much information on crypto in general as possible and be informed.
@_date: 2017-11-08 01:53:31
Cheers - I actually was not well versed in the material previously and so started there, but the moment they're made available to me I'm putting them on my Ledger Nano (which will also support the split) and starting to use Gemini (charges are SO much lower).
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:54:33


So with regards to the split, would there be a difference between me keeping my BTC in CB versus moving it to a Ledger? Is one advantageous over the other?
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:11:52
Some people haven’t been hodling for that long 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:30:05
Thank you sir. Most of my CB balance will be available in two days and I'll move it then to my ledger and I'll treat Gemini as separate until post-fork (perhaps only using it for a limit buy during the trough).
I'll probably stop using Coinbase altogether in favor of Gemini (or other exchanges), given the fees.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:31:13
just break $8,000 already! lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:49:05
Sorry if I misinterpreted your request, I didn't say it's more secure necessarily, it just eliminates the two biggest issues with Coinbase (speed and fees) without overly compromising the convenience. If you have a Coinbase account, you have a GDAX account.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:58:34
still almost 5x Gemini (and Gdax I believe?)
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:09:14
this is a ***fantastic analogy***
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:39

@_date: 2017-11-14 17:11:07
Not on Coinbase ;)
(I don't have an answer for you I just wanted to be sassy)
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:46:27
take it easy, Algernop
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:51:17
Considering you're more experienced, what about the situation demands a "perhaps" answer?
From what I've read, both Trezor and Ledger will provide support for splitting the coins as well, so unless the advantage at the moment is that it'll just happen automatically in CB, what would lean you specifically one direction vs another? (CB vs wallet, for example)
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:14:51
and also lets you set price alerts
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:19:16
Wire transfers within a couple hours tops and no limit at all
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:33:35
What do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:38:24
You’re not talking about B2X futures right? Just the coins created after the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:32:47
I'll look further into the differing technologies between BTC and ETH but surely ETH doesn't have the same exponential growth potential as BTC? I've been watching it hover around $300 for about a week now, fluctuating by a couple dollars at most.
Do you know what kind of effect the hard fork might have on ETH?
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:34:21
I've signed up for both, the former is verifying me and the latter needs some documentation I don't have at the ready to do so, cheers
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:52:41
[don't look at this Formula 1 steering wheel](
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:29:47
Apologies, the rest of your message didn't intimate that you were still talking specifically about card funding.
What's the % fee for it? I still would have to imagine that your coins are in limbo for a week before they arrive in the CB wallet anyways.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:26:28
Transfer form Coinbase to GDAX then from GDAX out and I believe you circumvent those fees (or at least fees to that degree).
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:37:45
I really like GDAX's look
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:58:51
This is a fantastic idea, I appreciate it! Would any tangible amount work? Like 0.0001 BTC? ;) Or is there a minimum?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:46:01
GDAX, GDAX is the system behind Coinbase.
I prefer Gemini myself though.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:12:22
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:53:23
[oh you mean this!](
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:04:50
Gdax better than Gemini? Gemini fees look like nothing!
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:26:59
RemindMe! 36 days "eat a sock!"
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:50:15
I started with Coinbase but I want to get everything off there because the speed and fees are just too slow/high, so this is good to know!
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:22:55
You think the value of BTC will jump 10x in the next 5 years?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:47:44
Cheers, does it take a few days to process or is it instantaneous?  Probably best to make the decision and pull the trigger by the 14th to be safe.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:05:07
No I'm saying that they aren't available in the interim on Coinbase to sell because there's a hefty amount of processing time between your purchase and when they're inserted in your CB wallet.
Also the fees are much higher. My fee for .1 BTC a couple weeks ago was $11, my fee yesterday on Gemini for the same amount was $1.50.
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:04:47
the .358 is just the card fee? then transaction fee on top of that right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:10
make sure you're factoring all of this profit realization for short-term capital gains tax or the IRS is going audit your anus
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:12:55
By exchange, you mean like Coinbase, right?
How long does it take to transfer from hardwallet to CB post-fork? I imagine that’s a lot of prime selling time lost there.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:37:42
As someone still learning replay protection, I’d be best off either hodling in Coinbase past the fork until the all clear or moving it now to a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:00:16
Ayre means penis in Arabic.

@_date: 2017-11-26 16:53:18
what's going on!? $9,299.99 on Coinbase..why is it flying up? correction coming soon?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:49:06
I think that’s a fair approach!
I’m not sure what “sitting in paper” means when it comes to bitcoin, though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:14
yep saw :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:29:23
ha that’s clever though
the 3% is the only fee or is there the same transaction fee also as if you were pulling from your bank?
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:23:09
Ah gotcha
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:34:50
I've only seen it by virtue of the CB widget on my iPhone where I casually monitor ETH and BTC (when I'm not on coinmarketcap) and it really just seems to fluctuate up and down around ~$65
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:24:28
Will Ledger as well? Just bought a Nano S
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:21:52
Ah! That makes sense, cheers!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:09
Even as a late-adopter I'm still well-green, just ride the waves people!
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:37:01
Thanks for this, I'll play close attention when my Ledger shows up
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:18:18


Let's see where things stand when the dust settles.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:18:46
What exchange do you use to trade?
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:16:20
I wasn't planning on using either going forward and just using Gemini or Kraken but my BTC and ETH would still have been on Coinbase, so it's good to know I can move them to GDAX and then off entirely without fees. But I'll take another look
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:22:27
I had a limit buy at 6.6 go through and set another one at 5.8 that I'm kinda masochistically hoping will be realized as well..
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:54:08
A FESTIVUS FOR THE REST OF US
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:16:16


I'm not overly experienced, but this kinda thing reads like "maybe if we put Bitcoin in part of the name, people that don't know any better will think it's dead and sell".
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:05:46
Oh wow, well I meant the purchasing of crypto is faster.
With Gemini I have unlimited wire transfers and it resolves in a matter of 1-2 hours.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:45:36
Use GDAX instead of Coinbase to start. If you like the overall system, it's the same exact thing and the purchases are realized much faster and with much lower fees.
I prefer Gemini atm for BTC (and ETH) purchases and am using Bittrex for XRP (though I've also heard good things about Bitstamp).
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:10:47
This, took a couple days for the bank account to be confirmed but now I can do same day wire transfers. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:46:51
I could see that.
I only ask because I'm setting up my Nano S and went with the segwit option because I read it has lower fees and I haven't read anything to support the alternative so I briefly had the OP's same question haha
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:01:23


There's so much to read about :o
Cheers for taking the time to go back and forth with a newbie.

wow it's not going to trough, time to buy some more..it's spiked $300 since this morning!
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:26:32
not bad at all, effectively a .108 increase on Gemini for the convenience of buying ASAP at the expense of not having access to your coin for a week
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:09:57
ok perfect, thanks for taking the time!
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:28:36
I don't know much about Litecoin, can you ELI5 its value or point me towards some good info? cheers!
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:09:30
AFAIK *only* Coinbase has a reputable app?
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:45:22
OK cheers, so if I do want to try to get in on the fun I should just come to terms that it will mostly be about buying low instead of selling high first and just transfer USD funds to Gemini in anticipation and monitor the price/set those limit buys.

Eh..an investment in their education is, maybe even directly, an investment in your financial stake.

I've bookmarked a number of links and articles I've found around here/casual searching, but do you have some go-to's you forward people?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:02:40
and you can tactically re-invest and buy more with an approach balanced to the free profit you already stand to make

Hmmm might set up some limit buy orders.. what do people think in terms of % degree of confidence that pre-fork the BTC price dips to:
- $6k
- $5.5k
- $5k
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:31:31
but then how would he taste your sass?
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:28:38
As in, permanently offline and just has the balance updated by plugging in your loaded HW to it?

*Translation check for the newb me:*
Does this mean if I move from Coinbase to Ledger or does that not even matter?
Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:12:38
What exchange will you use?
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:29:46

[sounded so familiar so I had to look it up](
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:05:35
makes sense, hopefully there aren’t too many people with limit sells who weren’t expecting such a quick rise
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:38:22
I like your handwriting
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:44:14
Fairly smooth to transfer to/from a hardwallet to those two?
By the way, thanks again for answering my q’s ;)

@_date: 2017-10-12 20:25:53
did you just assume my origin?
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:16:43
OK - I think it's time I did a little research on Bitcoin.
