No surprise at all that everyone that got REKT is blaming wall street, fake news &amp; manipulation instead of learning proper TA that told you for weeks this is a "Dead Cat Bounce"

Why is Bitcoin not 100 percent decentralized?!! Answer please.

Asshole. We are still in the denial phase!!

He is still the one running the show. He should be jailed.

First we need the Denial and Panic phases.
@_date: 2018-09-05 18:19:26
We are in a bear market simple as that.
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:02:55
We will test 5800$ soon. Perfect dead cat bounce... denial phase. When we break 5800$ the panic phase will begin.

Yes but cpo mining will eventually become just as decentralized if big companies get envolved.

We are in the denial phase.

You should only convince few 100 thousands and Bitcoin will be replaced. Bitcoin aint as big as google, facebook and apple.

You forgot to say goodbye to NEO��

I think you should give it a try. Yes its a mobile wallet. But it is decentralized. You own your keys.

Problem with Ledger is that if some from the firm wants to steal your recovery phrase. They can simply just upgrade the firmware and do it. Ledger Nano S is safe yes. But humans are not. But if someone from the Ledger company steal from customer. He will be hunted for the rest of his life. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:13:11
They will be right.
