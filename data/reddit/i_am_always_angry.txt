Whats wrong with XRP?

Nobody. You can't do shit.

Not sure how old you are, but I've been since Tradehill and Mt.Gox times in which I sadly lost a lot of money. I've had bitcoins since 2009 on and off and I have plenty of contributions to blockchain assets in my github account. Bitcoin ideally speaking is a great currency but it has been stagnant, too bureocratic and becoming everything it wanted to get away from, and the only reason driving the price up is because it was the first one, and is the one grabbing the headlines just because its the most well known one and the one used during the "Silk Road Times" when it got associated with crime and the name was further exposed to people.
I was around even when IXCOIN became a thing and was the new and improved "bitcoin" which ultimately failed.
Hell, I mined with a laptop CPU at one point.
Right now, Ripple has more potential because its working on solving a problem that bitcoin has not. Simple as that. Not sure why you guys need to make this a pissing competition.

XRP - 1.4 million transactions per day with a fee of less than 1 cent in most cases...... And thats not even stressing the network a little bit.

Oh sorry, I thought you said you were upgraded to  "coinbase instant". Can you then tell us how you got "upgraded" to "coinbase instant" outside of coinbase? Cause coinbase has that option and you're just confusing everyone if you are not talking about fucking coinbase.

Based on what? You can argue that the Bitcoin supply is too small learing to an extremely high price that translates to ridicuous fees.


I agree with you, 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:05:56
Just like ripple was less than a penny a year ago. By your logic then ripple shouldn't be bad either right?
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:47:30
Which defeats one of the biggest selling points of crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:40:15


And pay a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:03:23
How can you make money without mining bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:33:15
Yeah, sarcastic as fuck.
What kind of idiot will take 20k worth of something that has been consistently growing with room for more growth and put it into something that is falling or hovering at best?
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:54:23
So you took the best performing coin right now and changed it for one that is plummeting? Smart move.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:00:52
PEOPL! HODL! BY SELLING YOU ARE FUCKING MY INVESTMENTS!

Do you know when the last bitcoin will be mined? It will be around 2140.... let that sink in. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:57:29

Yeah, and you know, last bitcoin will be mined in 2140, so, inflation will be higher by then.

I'm not familiar with Trezor, but I have a question. He mentioned it is for Long term storage. What if the hardware stops working for some unknown reason when you try to retrieve your coin 3 years down the road?
@_date: 2015-12-25 08:36:31
I thought the last bitcoin was going to be mined somewhere arond 2140? ELI5 how 99% will be mined in the next 30 years?
@_date: 2015-12-25 20:25:43
This was very informative! Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:10:46
Shut uuuup!!!! I almost needed psychological help when I sold 2,000 coins around 8 bucks.... I MINED them with a fucking CPU,  so I thought I made a killing.
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:20:12
I have a question. If I had bitcoins prior to the fork, does that mean I still have the same amount of them in Bitcoin Cash? I have a cold wallet that has been stored for a while and I just realized there was a fork.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:35:29
I mean, the advice is not wrong.
