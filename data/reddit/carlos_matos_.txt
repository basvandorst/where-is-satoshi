How about this, dipshit: Some of HOLD because the fucking headache of dealing with banks is insane. Some of us DON'T WANT TO TRUST A THIRD PARTY to hold our funds. What are we supposed to do? Sell for cash MILLIONS OF FUCKING DOLLARS in coins and stuff it in our mattresses???

When government influences private companies to do certain things, thus bypassing due process that would otherwise be required, yeah...it's a fucking problem.
Google Operation Chokepoint, for example.
Porn not illegal. So rather than go through the long arduous process of making it illegal, gov't  influences private companies, like financial institutions, to stop doing business with porn stars or porn companies. (They closed the bank accounts of MULTIPLE porn actresses)
Yeah, that is just dangerous for a free society.

Piss on the wrong person's/entities/agencies shoes, and that "protected class" evaporates. 
History is full of billionaires that have ended up in jail. When you are the top of the heap socio-economically, the entire world wants you to see you fail and looks for ANY opportunity to take what's yours. It is precisely for this reason companies like Square take an aggressive approach to things like compliance...because if they didn't there are tons of people just LOOKING to cause a problem for them.
"Rich people = bad" mentality in America is over the top, at present. 
Martha Stewart found this all out personally.
Jack Dorsey seems like a tool. Though I can't say for sure because I've never met the man...maybe he's portrayed unfairly? In any event, fuck Twitter, and fuck regulations...but you can't expect people in Dorsey's position to behave any differently than he is.

Actually, AML requirements with FinCEN do require a MSB to log employment type for customers for certain amounts and/or if the transactions meets certain requirements like the "travel rule" etc...it all depends on what their written and approved AML policy dictates. These policies are audited by FinCEN periodically for compliance.
But hey, maybe Jack doesn't want to end up in jail or fined for YOUR politics. What a cuck he must be, AMIRITE??!?!

You won't find any sovereign nation that will accept crypto for a CBI program, yet. To my knowledge, anyway. 
Also, if you are serious about doing this, the method of payment is the last thing you should be worried about. There are several other processes and procedures that need to be handled first before you ever send payment with most these programs. Most of these CBIs take some time.
Do some more research.
