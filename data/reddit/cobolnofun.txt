Yeah people struggle with the concept that btc is not a stock but a currency. It's value comes from being usable. If everyone holds why would you want it in the first place?

Lets say there are two buses driving around town.  
Bus 1 (gox) got a flat tire one day.  However, instead of dealing with it, they just kept going.  The flat tire caused problems (rough ride, taking longer to get to stops, passing stops, loud noises, and general miserableness of a ride).  People started to complain, but the bus driver just kept driving, causing the problems to get worse and worse, until it got to a point where the flat tire shot off the rim hitting and breaking the only door off the bus.  Now no one can get off the bus, but the driver just keeps driving.  Finally after a few passengers jump out of the windows, the driver slams on the breaks and says "I am not going to drive any further until i figure out the problem".
To the passengers on the bus, this is even worse then before.  Before the couldn't get off the bus, now the bus isn't even going anywhere, they are so used to be beaten and ignored on that bus they feel the bus driver is just continuing down his path of stupid.  He might be drunk, we don't know.
After a while he discovers the tire is flat.  He comes back onto the bus and says "the tire is flat, the company did a bad job creating that tire and we will sit here on the side of the road till the tire company fixes their mistake". Obviously the bus passengers are angry.  He could have stopped on looked at the tire a long time ago.  He could be fixing the problem with the spare tire that is attached to the bus.  It is like a bad dream for these poor passengers.
Bus 2 (bitstamp) has been doing his route like normal during all of this.  He has missed a few stops here and there, was late to a stop a couple times, but overall been a decent bus driver.  Hell, no one will complain, because their other option is the crazy bus with a flat tire.
So Bus 2 comes around the turn and sees bus 1 sitting on the side of the road.  He pulls up and asks why he is just parked there?  He learns of the bad tires and bus1's plan to wait for the tire company.  He thinks about it for a second and realizes he has the same tires on his bus.  So the bus 2 driver pulls over in front of Bus 1 and tells his passengers "Hold on guys i am going to go check out the tires, and replace them WITH THE SPARE if they need to be replaced.  should be back on the road shortly"  The passengers on bus2 are upset they have to wait, but think back to the horror stories of bus1...

hmm so "shady" but no actual facts about any actual malfeasance.
tdlr of your post: I don't like BTC-e
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:29:55
Shall i go through an find all the threads with problems with Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, bitcoin.de? 
I don't have anything with btc-e, but you keep hammering btc-e with nothing more then "they are shady protect yourself" and it comes off as spam.  That actually is shady!!
What is your benefit to slandering them and not the others?

Holy shit Butterfly Labs is out of Leawood? I drive by their office everyday and never even knew.    
This also explain why a law office in Leawood started accepting Bitcoin awhile back.

I read that section and thought... "hmmm the government must be keeping tabs on certain addresses, or at least what they can"  
That being said I doubt anyone dealing with this many btc will be sending it to an address that has ever even remotely seen the light of the internet.
