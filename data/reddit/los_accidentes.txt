I'm so glad he told us. I can't believe I got so lucky to find the only person on Reddit who knows the future in such an obscure comment section. Thanks crypto Jesus!

yes, the person below hit it on the head exactly. I was trying to say, while high Tx costs is great for profit for people running mining rigs. IT'S TERRIBLE for the technology as a whole and will absolutely kill it if forced too high.

I could not agree more. Once the meming dies, the tech dies with it. People are taking this business way too seriously. Don't bet your shirt if you don't want to lose it. Take care you magnificent bastard.

it means significantly lower income. I operate many SHA256 miners and I am fortunate enough to have the cheapest, most reliable, electricity available to the common man and this is moving the break over point up in time substantially. I'm not mad about it. It is better for the adoption and use of BTC as a whole, which will ultimately lead to more Tx. paying 1000 sat per byte is a game killer.

I'm seeing statistics showing the exact opposite is true. Do you have any data to support your claim or is it just an opinion?

This. So put on your tinfoil hats everyone. This is going to get weird.  Here is the scenario that keeps me from selling everything I own to buy more btc. You know how Uncle Sam can't stand people or places that own any appreciable amount of oil and don't want to sell it to us for a very good price? For example, Iraq, Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and on and on and on. The US will straight overthrow an entire government without giving a single fuck about the repercussions to get that sweet darkness. The world knows this. The only thing the US cares more about than oil is it's currency. I can remember only 2 instances of news agencies reporting discussion on moving the OPEC off of the dollar to some other currency.  Both times this idea disappeared almost faster than it appeared. Thing is, with a situation like moving off of the dollar there is only so many people and places the US can bomb to get people to stop pushing the idea of an alternative world currency. Now for the point of this whole inane rambling, which I'm sure you all have figured out where I am going with this. Imagine this threat to US currency dominance is coming from a bunch of punk ass computers flipping bits located all over hell's half acre. My guess is any significant movement away from the US dollar to crypto will result in seriously negative repercussions for the US economy. I haven't settled on the exact mechanism on how it would be bad, but I just can't envision a scenario where decreasing the dollar's velocity will result in anything positive for the US economy. Please tell me how I am wrong here. 
So if the US is willing to invest Trillions in traditional "defense." Imagine the kinds of cyber weaponry it must maintain for exactly the scenario describe above where global finance starts to move money as cryptocurrency instead of dollars thereby causing (deflation?) US economic suffering in some major way. I would bet my virgin butthole it has enough computational capability today to do whatever it wants with bitcoin. Whether it's employing more than 50 percent of the calculations to spoof coins or by simply screwing with global transactions causing devastating confidence losses for the system as a whole. 
This is what concerns me about bitcoin growing to the level of 100's of thousands of dollars per coin, which for the record, I think is almost inevitable. The only variable is whether it will take 40 years or 4. I should've prefaced this tirade with, I am not an economist! Like any of you hadn't figured that out yet. Cheers all and happy fortune making.

Well fortunately I am not facing 7 figure mysterious sums. More like amounts one could explain away via items sold at sales tax rates. This rate is far better than the typical tax rates for similar things. don't be shitty Barry.

I would very much like an answer for, if there is no record of purchase or sale of btc, how could any 3rd party challenge you (the owner of btc) on taxable income?

I can not over state how much I have been saying what this article is ranting about. Cme futures started this shit show. There is always a bottom and I'm fortunate enough to not care if what I bought is devalued to the point of pocket sand. There's more than enough liquid capital in the world to justify this conspiracy, but what i dont get is how a whale could covert a billion dollars worth of fiat into crypto with any expediency. Who could possibly back something like this? To me, this is the hole in the plot line.

I avoid tether like the plague. It was my understanding tether didn't back single entities in the billions of dollars. I know they printed 100's of millions of "new" tether. Obviously, this isn't nothing, but still seems far from enough to pull of the kind of manipulation discussed here. Did I just miss how much tether printed or what?
