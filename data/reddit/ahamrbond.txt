I have a good way of making it go down a few thousand too. Tried and tested. 100% guaranteed. All I have to do is.... buy some bitcoin.

Gold won't be replaced - in fact, if Bitcoin becomes the new currency, gold will skyrocket. 
The current gold market is based on gold derivatives, and is thousands of times bigger than the actual quantity of gold. The price is suppressed quite heavily. 
Let's say you make ten million dollars on bitcoin and the price starts to plateau... would you want to keep all your eggs in one basket or diversify? You probably don't want to go back into the dollar (which will be tanking at this point), so the stock market is not an option. So what do you buy? Real estate, silver and gold will all hold their value better than the dollar and are historically safe.
Gold and Bitcoin can be friends.

If enough people get into bitcoin (or similar), that means that they have to effectively "sell" their dollars. 
That means there will be a greater supply of dollars. 
The value (or "price") of dollars will drop. 
Interest rates rise in order to encourage people to save their dollars. 
People are no longer able to pay their mortgages due to high interest rates. 
Massive sell off of houses turns into a panic as the market is flooded. 
House prices drop precipitously. 
People walk away from their mortgages en masse. 
(FYI 90% of mortgages are insured by the FHA - aka the US Government).
Federal Reserve prints more dollars to cover all the unpaid mortgages to try and keep the banks in business (similar to Quantitative Easing, but worse).
Value of dollar falls further due to a doubling of available dollars.
Investors panic - take their money out of anything that is denominated in dollars. 
Chinese stock market (Shanghai Stock Exchange) soars. 
Chinese investors pull out of US housing market and put money into Shanghai Stock Exchange. 
US housing market falls further. One bitcoin can now by a small apartment in Manhattan.
Almost all existing mortgages default. 
Federal Reserve has printing presses running around the clock. 
Value of dollar is so low that a loaf of bread is $50 - $100
Investors put money in gold, silver and bitcoin.
Suddenly we come to the realization that the gold market is rigged, and there isn't nearly as much gold in the Federal Reserve as we have been told. 
Value of gold skyrockets while the paper gold market collapses. 
All the large investment banks cannot pay their obligations and are now out of business. 
Nasdaq is still at record highs - but only when measured in worthless US dollars. 
During this whole fiasco, smart money goes into bitcoin, which is increasingly being used as a legitimate currency out of necessity.
Many retailers start refusing to accept dollars.
Government tries to stop bitcoin but bitcoin billionaires can afford better lawyers and expensive lobbyists.
Federal Reserve keeps printing increasingly worthless dollars. Bread is at $650 a loaf.
Almost all Americans (who haven't already) exchange their remaining USD for gold, silver and bitcoin 
US Dollar finally dies
No one cares - bitcoin has worked out all its kinks and is easier and more fun to use. 
Entire world adopts bitcoin as the global monetary system collapses.
New World Order find a way to control bitcoin and create a one-world government and a global fascist state, controlling every aspect of our lives and crushing dissent. All firearms are now illegal, the idea of nationhood and sovereignty is abolished, all children are raised by the state and their vocations are chosen at birth. 
Human beings enjoy many centuries of abject slavery.

with bitcoin, you can send money to australia almost as easily as you can send a facebook message. 
think about the issues you would have with your bank if you tried to send money to australia. It's completely possible, but a pain in the ass. The point is that the functionality of bitcoin is paradigm-shifting. 
However, paypal is pretty good too.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:54:38
seems like they could have fixed this with a software update. 
Why not just lock in the value at time of purchase and give the customer a five minute window to complete the purchase at that quantity of bitcoin?
I'm sure Steam must be really upset about all the bitcoin they are holding now - must be terrible for them/s

It doesn't matter if you are trying to get rich quick, if you are looking for a long term investment, if you are really into the tech. The truth is this: You are already invested. You are already invested in a commodity that loses value every year. The Dollar. The dollar is losing value. $100 in 1980 would be worth $34.77 today. 
Find something you want to invest in, and put some money into it. You can diversify for sure (it is the safest way). I plan on putting about 10% of my money into crypto currencies because it seems like a good time to do it, but you may have other ideas. $100 is not too little; transaction fees are low. Just be aware that the dollar is a sure fire losing investment strategy, so you are losing money (or, at least, value) as we speak.

Thank you for your service. Good luck with your investing.

Crypto currencies could eventually lead to the dollar crashing

there is a little resistance at each 1k mark
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:41
Last year I bought a flight home for Christmas for about $1k
This year I bought a flight home for Christmas for about $1k
If the USD value had truly shrunk to 8% of it's value in the last year, my most recent flight purchase would have cost $8,000
However, no one else is picking you up on this, so perhaps I'm missing something here? 
However, if you meant that USD has shrunk by 8% in the last year, then I might be open to believing it if you gave some kind of source.

When the dollar collapses, you will see gold become more expensive than you can imagine right now. The price is suppressed by the large investment banks and the "paper gold" market. 
You'll all start to become friendlier towards gold as time goes on - as people start to desert the dollar, owning gold will offset a lot of the distrust in the crypto market. Bitcoin and gold (and litecoin and silver) will co-exist quite happily and everything will be just fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:58:02
On the one hand I feel bad for these people. It just seems like it can't end well. 
Then again, they will probably made a shed ton of cash. 
But then again, people who make these types of decisions are likely to lose all their money at some point in the not too distant future. 
Then againthey might make even more money
Then again they might not
Then again perhaps I should just shut up now.

Coinbase seems the most legit to me. 
But like the other guy says, you gotta do your own research because we could be anyone. Be careful out there. Security first.
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:19:20
It's good to be diversified. Bitcoin may look better than gold, but gold has a looooong history of providing financial security for its owners.

It costs $1200 to get it out of the ground, and it is at $1200 now - so I don't think it can go significantly lower; it will always have that resistance.  
I don't claim to know anything at all - so I can't say I'm absolutely sure of course. No one can tell the future. But it's a good time to buy in my opinion.   
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:45:32

Just imagine you were talking about an app like twitter or instagram. Say the number of users just keeps on rising and rising. At some point it is going to reach saturation point, but there could be billions of users around the world. Would you call that a bubble? 
Bitcoin technology not an app, but this same logic applies. The technology is not owned by anyone - it is free - but the only way to use it is to buy bitcoin. And there are advantages to using bitcoins which will grow and grow and grow as the technology improves. 
Right now, bitcoin price is so volatile, that only the more daring people are buying at any significant amount, but a lot of people are just throwing in $50 or so in the hope of making a few dollars and finding out what it is all about. The truth is, it could crash; digital currency is here to stay, but bitcoin could run into some unforeseen issue and be replaced by something else, with millions of people losing all their bitcoin.
But bitcoin's user base will most likely continue to grow and at some point people start to realize that the bitcoin network could be way better than using a bank, and it would be better to have all their money in bitcoin rather than in a bank in dollars (after all, dollars lose value every year - it's called inflation). This won't happen until there are a lot more users of bitcoin, after the price of bitcoin has settled down, and once bitcoin is taken more seriously by the mainstream. 
The early adopters will be the ones who got rich. Most of the fortunes have already been made and it will not necessarily be a massive wealth transfer in the big scheme of things. As far as bubbles go, this one is pretty small so far, even though it is pretty dramatic. I expect things to start leveling out somewhat. 
The point is that bitcoin is not like other commodities on the market. It is the bitcoin system that holds the value. Digital currency exchanges will one day be as unremarkable as emails, and will manifest themselves in our lives more rapidly than you might expect. 
I understand my answer might be frustrating to many people. I'm only just coming to terms with bitcoin myself, but after listening to a few of its proponents talking about it, I realize that it deserves more thought and respect than I initially believed. It is a paradigm shifting technology; the internet of money. It will change the future, one way or the other. Watch.
@_date: 2018-06-28 02:30:48
I think it is international payments which will be the breakthrough for Bitcoin into the mainstream. The advantage is so glaring.

Something like this needs to be adopted by people like us. A bit coin-linked Visa debit card makes it easy to use bitcoin for regular purchases, and gets people used to hodling bitcoin. 
I don't know if the service I linked to above is a good example or not, but it is an example. WE need to be the ones adopting these new products, finding out which one is the best, and carving out a path for others to follow. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:41:25
yeah that's right. 
still means that people are betting on bitcoin without directly affecting supply.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:47:37
There is the possibility that it will be good for bitcoin in that it will make it more visible and respectable. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:16:05
Yes you are right. They would be taking bets on Bitcoin's price, not actually investing in it. The Bitcoin supply would be unaffected, but the demand would fall dramatically. If you are in Bitcoin for speculative reasons, then this is definitely not good for you. 
The only positive is that it would remove a lot of the volatility around bitcoin and make it more viable as a digital currency.
Edit: I'm not a finance guy, and I am probably missing some angles here. I posted this comment more to start a conversation rather than to drop some knowledge. There is the possibility that it will be good for bitcoin in that it will make it more visible and respectable. I just don't know either way to be sure tbh. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:00:12
this guy gets it
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:02:46
Bitcoin price will not be based on the futures market. 
However the bitcoin futures could dilute the bitcoin market by offering an alternative and expanding the supply with "phantom bitcoins". The limited supply of bitcoins is what is driving up the price so hard, so there could be a negative side to this.

I think a lot of us here are both excited by bitcoin as a currency (we'd like to see it become widely used) and would like to make some money on it as adoption grows. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:52:42
of course there is no way to accurately predict... however, we could be looking at a significant correction in the stock market (10%). This has been predicted by a bunch of people and would be a generally healthy, overdue and much needed correction. 
However, this could take place over the space of a few weeks. 
In the meantime, cryptos are pretty cheap right now... there could be a perfect storm brewing, as people start getting out of the stock market and start looking for other places to put their money. 
The dollar looks relatively strong right now, so it is a good time to buy buy buy.
If stock market money starts moving into crypto - then this will be potentially huge.
@_date: 2018-02-11 07:06:56
If the dollar devalues, then bitcoin will rise in price against the dollar so it could happen that way.
If, via global adoption, bitcoin gets as big as the American Dollar, then one bitcoin would be valued at what half a million dollars is currently worth. Roughly.
Nothing is realistic or unrealistic at this point. I'm betting on bitcoin to win, but I still have doubts.

As far as I'm aware, most Bitcoin ATMs just receive cash and don't dispense it. Unless you can exchange bitcoin for cash, it is useless for this purpose.

Think about it as a gradual slide of money from a corrupt system into an incorruptible one. That's how many of us look at it. 
I don't think it is so much about destroying the previous system as it is facing up to its shortcomings and slowly moving over to something that makes a lot more sense. 
Early signs are positive, but of course, we could be wrong.

the system is blockchain - bitcoin is built on blockchain.
a lot of people seem to think that bitcoin is unhackable. It is decentralized so no one controls it. 
I wish I could tell you more - I'm no expert tho. If this is interesting, there is a ton of material online to help you understand bitcoin.
