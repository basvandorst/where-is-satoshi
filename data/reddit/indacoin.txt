It's already less than 20%
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:41:35
Guys, here are 5% discount coupons. Just copy-paste one of them on the order page  if you need to buy bitcoins with your card
@_date: 2016-09-07 14:26:06
The current price on  is $708, while the market price is about $612, so the markup is only 16%. We'll add here discount coupons later to make a test purchase

$1000 was yesterday, the current price is $700 :)
@_date: 2016-09-07 07:34:14
are you kidding? What for will we track BTC users? :)
The only thing we need is to understand if the real card owner, but not a fraudster is paying with the card.

The price is usually shown on the left side of the screen. And at the current moment it's much higher than we'd like it to be. The thing is that sometimes we face cash gap issues and have to increase the markup to avoid running out of bitcoins. The rate will be decreased by at least 20% within the next few days. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 17:58:13
sorry for that, we'll do our best to respond asap
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:23:56
the current price on  for a buyer is only $733 while the market price is $607. If you previously bought any bitcoins from us, you'll have a discount up to 5%. If you add a 5% discount coupon, the final price will be $659 per bitcoin, meaning that the markup is less than 9%, and all the fees are included in that price

Obviously, it’s extremely difficult to deal with fraudulent transactions but we have been developing anti-fraud system for more than 2 years and have gained some experience in this field (average chargeback rate for the last year is less than 2%). So it's not true that most of our customers steal financial information. By contrast, if we see a suspicious payment, we inform the issuer bank about it and the bank reaches the client to be sure  that he/she really made a purchase on our website.

We explained that the max. 20% markup is our goal. The fee is increased only if we are lack of liquidity. We do understand that even 20% is too much and 30% - 40% is ridiculous. Hope, there won't be such cases again. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 17:41:03
the current markup is about 16%. If you use discount coupon or have already bought bitcoins, there could be an additional discount up to 5%. 
The main value preposition is an option to buy bitcoins without registration. So if you need to pay with bitcoins, you don't have to create a wallet, but enter the bitcoin wallet address of the recipient on our website. Another selling point is verification process, that is pretty simple and fast. Our goal is to proceed with all verifications within 15-20 minutes. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:08:31
We are totally agree that the current price is not lucrative at all. We are trying to decrease the markup to 20-25%
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:38:31
the problem is that 3d secure almost doesn't work in the US and Canada. Most of carders can easily get an access to the internet banking and find out the code
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:36:44


thanks for the understanding :) if you are willing to test our service in the future and write a few words about the user experience, we'll be happy to fully compensate the markup. So if the fee is 20%, we'll send additional 20%

Hey guys, thanks for creating this post. A few comments on behalf of Indacoin:
We started in 2013 with creating a trading platform but later realized that it’s almost impossible to compete with the major bitcoin exchanges. The point is that to attract new clients trading fees should be lower than 0.2% but it’s not enough at all to build a sustainable business, especially when you are running a bitcoin company and facing so much risk. So we decided to focus on smth. that could differentiate us from other services and found out that there were very few exchanges that accepted banking cards. So our main value preposition is that we let people buy bitcoins with a credit/debit card in more than 100 countries without registration. If somebody needs bitcoins for the first time, it's more likely that he will use our [instant exchange service]( and receive cryptocurrency within an hour, rather than register on other exchanges, send KYC docs and wait for a few days before getting the coins.

Guys, if you have some time to test our service  will be happy to provide you with a $10 bonus - just make a 10$ transaction, write a few words here about your user experience and pm us email you used for the purchase. We ll send additional $10 worth of bitcoins to you. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 07:19:43
We request the phone number to prevent fraudulent transactions and you have to specify this info only once. After that you just enter email, amount and the card details. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 15:29:47
thanks, but there is no an option to buy bitcoins with a card there, isn't it?
@_date: 2016-10-10 15:26:46
thanks for that, that is the reason why we are thinking about other features that could be added to this extension. For instance there could be no need to have a bitcoin wallet and store bitcoins there. If you need to buy smth, you are forwarded to a payment page and bitcoins are sent to the recipient. But its likely not enough
@_date: 2016-10-10 17:23:45
the thing is that when you load such a plugin with bitcoins, you'll anyway face the risk of being hacked. That's why we suggest not to store bitcoins but purchase them only case by case
