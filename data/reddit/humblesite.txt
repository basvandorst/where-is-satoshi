How does this scam work in the crypto realm? Do they really send you the BTC just to withdraw it for them? Cause if they do, I'll make a bunch of burner wallets and just take their btc and convert it to monero right away to be stored in a hardware wallet. Though I doubt that's how it works.

Do you even know the different lambo types there are?

ah, well that's fucking retarted.

I wonder how the guy who sold it for btc feels
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:50:42
Yeah I'm totally begging. That's why it says should someone wish to donate.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:19:08
Best feeling ever.

I'm still down 40% lol did the math yesterday. Apperantly I've invested 13k total buying the dips, up to 8k in value. Almost breaking even! Even if it goes lower again though I still wouldn't sell. Rather have the value parked here than in my bank account losing 8% every year.

Thank you, I had to play with the wording a lot to get it working out that way lol Thank you to the person who tipped the Bitcoin address too! XD

Looks like I'm finally trading my SV for some ABC. Should've fucking done it long ago when I could get 1 for 1 for it.
Edit: I'd trade it for btc but I'm already part of the og 21 m club so I'm content with that. Diversifying is now my game.
Edit 2: u/newbrict I didn't buy. Got them free when it forked
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:17:21
The 50% still has a chance to 1000*. The 8% loss is permanent lol. I'll take the non permanent loss any-day.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:16:07
Yup. Bought first at like 500 a coin. Then kept buying on the way down. BTC and alts though. It's climbing back up fast.
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:18:24
Incase anyone wished to tip in something other than reddit gold.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:57:18
You mean the first post I made and deleted on my alt? RemarkableNotice is me.

Oh shit no wonder I got an email from the Chinese embassy this morning...

It's risen more than any other coin during this bull market. So I'll diversify there and keep my BTC handy thank you very much. This way I won't have to spend my btc and just use crappy bch for my retirement uses instead.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:06:40
Understandable. I appreciate you looking out, though now your first comment makes it look like I reposted someone elses content instead of just reposting my own with a better title. It will likely keep that impression causing my content to get downvoted. If you could add an edit letting people know that is not the case I would appreciate it.
Edit: Thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:19:37
**FUCK!** China can't even take a joke -_-. Well, maybe I'll get to stack up more then. Silver linings and whatnot
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:48:17
I'll give it to you for 19,000 BTC, deal? You'll still profit 1000 btc if you can get in.

u do understand there's only 21 million coins that will ever exist right? The value increases dramatically because of that. Every 3 to 4 years the amount of bitcoins beings made is halved, creating a lower supply as the demand gets higher overtime. There are 39 millionaires in the world today, so not even enough bitcoins out there for all of them, there's barely enough for each to get even half a coin. This is why everyone projects 1 million dollars a coin, because when the space becomes a mainstream recommended portion of any companies and persons portfolio, then they will drive the price up dramatically as we have been seeing every halving when they come in trying to grab themselves a full coin. The last coin will be mined in the 2130's, we won't be around by then the odds are, but just imagine what it will be then when the whole world is trying to by 1 coin? Imagine what it will be like in 2050 with the whole world is trying to buy just thousands of coins? Bitcoin was created to prevent inflation, it's whole design is to be deflationary in comparison to the fiat markets.

I prefer crypto, but you know diversify your bonds and all that. But if the stockmarket ever outpaces my crypto investments then I'll favor it one day. Fat chance though, cause my 10% investment in crypto has outgrown my stocks by 100 times, so the stock will have a huge way to go to catch up to it now.

2019 will be the year prepping us for the 1 million token of 2021

The odds of demand going away now with walstreet and all the other institutional investors hopping in are extremely low. You can bet on that though if you want, keeping your money in fiat that exponentially loses value every year. I'll keep putting it away in here and the stock market to have some growing investments.

I have 20 thousand bitcoins trapped in a hard-wallet I haven't been able to access in 7 years. Only thing keeping me going is the 2 thousand bitcoins I had in an accessible wallet.

I titled it wrong, meant to say something along the lines of prevent us from crashing with it. Will delete and repost with a more accurate title.
