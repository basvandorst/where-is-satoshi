That's not true.  It was actually useful as a currency to buy drugs and things back then, or to launder your money out of China.  Now the fees, transaction times and volatility make it useless for any real purpose.

No.  Nobody lends (or more specifically, borrows) deflationary currency.  For what should be obvious reasons.

The government won't let the market indexes crash again.  In case you missed it, the majority of the "recovery" gains are just the direct result of the dollar being devalued.  that is, since dollars are worth less, it takes more of them to purchase the same value of assets.. But on paper, it looks like the stocks are going up, because they are worth more dollars... Even though the true value hasn't changed much.  Make sense?
Inflation isn't even a valid metric, as it doesn't actually measure increased cost of goods.. It measures the value of the dollar against other currencies.  With the European economies in the shitter and China directly pegging their currency to the dollar, it's just one giant mess of entirely manipulated numbers.

The price depression is 100% the result of the Chinese government cracking down on Chinese exchanges, as bitcoin is being used to get money out of China (a big no no).  Most of the drastic rise in bitcoin value this past year was driven by the Chinese market.

For the record, its pretty rare for SEC enforcement to find its way to a jury trial, generally its handled by in house administrative judges and nobody else.

Well, to be fair its still the defacto currency for darknet markets, hackers, and other criminals etc... which is technically real world economic activity.  Its also still used to smuggle money out of places like China etc too, I'm not sure if that counts as "real world" activity?

Sorry mates.  I had actually originally typed the start time with time zone, but I wasnt sure of my math and purposely meant to delete the time specifics, in the hopes that I wouldnt make an error and get eaten alive by reddit.  I figured the charts from Saturday speak for themselves, the sharp dip is when the event happened, the recovery when the problem was fixed.
@_date: 2015-04-27 01:02:53
Aye.  I think we've ended up outside of the original scope of my post.  I was just commenting on the evenings activity, not macro trends.  Its clear BTC is going to continue to lose value until the mining cap is hit, at which point we'll probably see a reversal (or the death of bitcoin, hah).
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:49:59
Theres really no difference, mechanically speaking.  If anything Bitcoin is a little worse because it has a much larger pool of speculators who lack appropriate understanding of financial markets.  The market is a bit more irrational by comparison, without the large institutional banks and funds to anchor things.
Ive been trading equities for about 9 years now, and bitcoin market probably most reminds me of pink stocks, honestly. Theres some substance beneath the surface to keep the ship afloat, but its really the wild west for speculative investors.
The biggest problem with BTC is that there is nothing to anchor to, to keep the currency around.  It could be replaced by another cryptocurrency overnight and the things people use cryptocurrency for just.. wouldnt really be that affected.  Government backed currency ensures legitimacy because the government will always be trading in their dollars.  
There is no authority to do that for BTC.
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:24:56
I clearly stated that I did... and all these sites say is that there are more items listed on Agora.  Absolutely zero claims about sales volume.  All this indicates is that there is more merchant competition and a wider selection of goods... it tells us absolutely nothing about how many dollars worth of goods are actually traded.
Sales volume would be the driving factor for BTC value.
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:24:16
I was merely reporting on what I observed.  Macro trends are what they are.  Initiating a BTC buy on Saturday for a planned transaction, and waking up Sunday to find the BTC you bought is no longer worth enough to cover said transaction, blows.  
I saw lots and lots of speculation being posted all over, and figured I could at least shed some light onto this mornings surprise for those who were out of the loop.
@_date: 2015-04-27 09:06:56
My summation was that the BTC market is literally unpredictable.  It just isnt feasible.  You'll end up with a bunch of people who take guesses... the ones who luck out and win will pat themselves on the back and be convinced they are smarter than everybody else and were making the correct decisions all along.   
The losers will think they got screwed or drew the short straw, "bad luck".
...and a very small minority of intelligent and well funded individuals will manipulate the markets and rob the inexperienced blind, just as they do on the standard equities markets, only with a bit more of an all you can eat christmas buffet style as the BTC markets are unregulated and they're big fish in a small pond.
The most valuable lesson I've learned from my last decade of trading is that its better to sit idle and prepared, while only rarely pouncing on the sweetest opportunities when you somehow get an edge which minimizes your risk.  My largest struggle personally is conquering the feeling that my money should always be doing *something*, or else its doing nothing.  Took more than a few years to develop acceptable discipline.

BTC dropped 8% overnight.

Ooh a MACD chart overlaid on volume.  Congratulations on discovering Swing Trading 101.  $200 will act as a tough floor, but I suspect we'll continue to see dilution until we actually hit the mining cap... at which point it should reverse and gain in value endlessly, so long as the currency remains utilized, if for no other reason than people will inevitably lose bitcoins/wallets over time.
Of course, there is no real reason to ever *hold* bitcoin outside of speculation... its not like it pays a dividend.  So that should keep things nice and irrational.
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:13:57


Thats easy.  Bitcoins utilization is directly fueled by illicit commerce, and not much else.  The rise and fall of BTC market cap was tethered directly to The Silk Road.  Obviously the darknets are still out there, but its a more splintered marketplace and to a 3rd party observer, more complex and risky than it once was.
The second most significant factor was the Chinese government cracking down on Chinese Citizens utilizing BTC as a means to smuggle money out of China (its basically illegal to try to transfer funds out of China without legitimate business cause).  This greatly cooled the asian markets, which were a significant source of the demand 2 years ago.
Combine those macro factors with major bitcoin scams and thefts happening all too frequently, especially in the darknet markets, and its easy to understand why somebody who gave Mail Order Drugs a shot, would now be reverting back to their neighborhood dealer.  
Then of course, theres the fact that NSA capabilities have become common knowledge over that same time period...  (there are many factors, obviously).

I was merely trying to inform people of an anomaly some of us observed Saturday night which disrupted our ability to complete some transactions/sales.  I was not making any type of long term analysis of BTC.
[With that said, however, I have now written a detailed posting on my views of the current status of the BTC market, including some rather exciting technical markers set to force some volatility in the very near future.  Read it and let me know your thoughts!](

Which was my opinion as well, but rumors will be rumors.  Reddit was flooded with people freaking out, but most of those posts seem to have been nuked.

Not a terrible idea.  I always thought I should have run one of those pre-order campaigns for custom mining hardware that steals everyone's money and then never delivers the hardware :P
@_date: 2015-04-27 08:53:32
Yep, which just leaves dudes in Asia running massive farms of purpose designed and fabricated hardware to mine not only quickly but using more energy efficient circuitry,
(or hell lets be honest, corrupt Chinese dudes billing the hardware and energy to the Chinese government while reaping the outputted rewards for themselves....)
They could literally run the entire operation at a gross loss but net gain to themselves....
@_date: 2015-04-27 08:00:57


Thats a matter of perspective.  Its more difficult/expensive for your average Joe... but the beast miners are still chugging along as they always have.  Technology has been advancing right along with the market the whole way, except that every day those ultra wealthy miners earn more and more revenue to throw at even better mining solutions.  In some ways, its easier than ever for them to mine, and control the markets as all the smaller less funded miners get squeezed out.
The fact that BTC has been in a long downward slope just shows that supply exceeds demand for BTC.  I dont see any reason for this to stop until the mining cap is reached, and no new coins can be made.
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:57:37


Do you have a source for sales volume between the markets?  Ive only been able to find comparisons of total listings offered, which doesnt really tell much in this context.  Genuinely would like to find some reputable numbers.
Also, while there is some minor acceptance of BTC in the retail realm, I'd be willing to bet my left nut that it doesnt compare in any way to the darknets in terms of revenue.
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:28:11
In what context?  How long do you plan to hold the BTC for?
The current floor is ~$200 USD.  "Floor" generally meaning that it is the low end  price being supported by the market right now.  Each time the price has dropped, it  found support at ~$200 (meaning speculators decided to start buying at that price,  which drives the price back up.  We'll refer to this as a "bounce" off the "test".  If you  look at a MACD chart (Moving Average Convergence and Divergence), you can see  that the price sort of bounces up and down, each time it tests the floor, it bounces  back up to the "ceiling" (or the highest people will buy, until speculators feel its over  valued and begin to sell, which drops the price back down towards the floor).
[Here is a MACD chart which I have labeled for you.](
The pink lines and text are my marks.  Two things I want you to notice:  We started  with huge volatility (change in price), and this volatility narrows over time as traders  seek an accepted price for the commodity.  See how the ceiling and floor lines are  converging to a point?
The second thing I want you to notice are the locations I marked "test".  These are  the points where a drop/crash found support, and in turn rebounded.  Notice anything  in particular about these dips?  **1)** They all essentially find support at the same  place. **2)** The tests are becoming more frequent over time.
What does this mean?  Well... it means we're about to see some fireworks real soon  :).  The price range is going to continue to narrow until it rests right on that ~$200  support mark... at which point everybody holds their breath to see what happens.   This is where big players will make their move, to either support the floor (bulls) or  abandon it (bears).  
If the price drops below the floor, expect everybody whose been on the sidelines to  dump their BTC and we'll experience a significant sell off/crash.... until we find a new  floor... which could be basically anywhere.  Expect lots of volatile swings during this  period (like the beginning of our chart above was).
If the price holds firm at the floor, then the bears will abandon their shorts, and to  fulfill those shorts they'll have to... buy all those shares back!  Which will typically  cause an upward spike, and again the bull speculators will jump on board and buy  buy buy expecting to ride the wave upward towards finding a new ceiling, confident  that they aren't likely to lose since the floor was just proven to be firm.
What should YOU do?  Well, that depends on if you think its going down or up.   IMHO, and its only that... my opinion, BTC value will continue to drop so long as new  coins are being mined and sold on the markets.  Demand is not currently keeping up  with supply of new coins, plain and simple.  In a more rational market, where we're talking about  owning companies or physical assets, you can assign an estimate as to the real  value of the company or commodity and place your bets off those estimates.
Bitcoin, however... has no real world backing.  Its only being held up by nerd faith,  essentially.  A company will be held up by their revenue/dividends/assets.   Government backed bills will be supported because the government will demand  payment, taxes, etc in their currency.  These things act to create stability.  BTC  does not have real world stability or backing.
What I personally expect to happen, is the "whales" everyone talks about are going to attempt to manipulate the fuck out of the market at this key juncture.  People who hold large amounts of BTC will try their damndest to hold that $200 floor firm as fuck (or else lose a bunch of money), while the shorts are going to try to sell sell sell to push the price below the floor, to trigger a mass panic/sell off/crash.  It becomes a sort of tug of war.  
Since the BTC market is so small (compared to other real world markets), there is no real way to predict the outcome here.  We're fish in a small pond... so the big players can do things like force the price below the floor, triggering a sell off... only to then swoop down and buy up all that cheap BTC from the desperate sellers, rebound sharply, push the price to a new high (triggering a bull market where everyone wants in, and then sell all that BTC they just got for cheap to the NEW dopes who saw the rebound and are trying to buy into the upward wave towards the new ceiling.
So in summary... speculating BTC is a rather terrible idea.  I'm risk averse, when it comes to investing some moves *are* far safer than others, its just a matter of making sure you understand all the variables and influences in the equation.
While everyone can deny or misinterpret my original submission here, I know for a fact that I saw a panic sell off from only a few swiftly moving rumors about a single BTC marketplace having difficulties last night, which tells me that BTC holders are an extremely skittish group these days, which scares me away from having any interest in BTC investment.  As the old saying goes, the markets can usually stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.... and BTC is a whole new breed of irrational market.
**PS** I feel its important to add that the $200 floor isnt actually held up by anything tangible.  Its a mental marker, and nothing more.  Humans naturally like nice even numbers, and floors and ceilings will firm up along these borders for no real reason than because people "feel" like defending that number.  They promise themselves "I'll sell if it drops below $200" etc, and then do so, simply because its an easy number.  Never forget this.

Reddit has taught me that almost nobody has a clue about how to read volume or a MACD chart, and they definitely dont understand simplistic investing concepts like price supports and ceilings.
