Well your Bitcoins are safe, you just need to let it completely sync before you will see your balance and are able to move your coins (which might take some time).
Next time you should use Mycelium or Electrum or something that is not a full node. xD
If you don’t want to wait until your computer has downloaded the entire blockchain you can also export your private keys and import them in a new wallet (like Mycelium or Electrum).

Well to be honest it doesn’t, but I don’t think there can be any prove that this is real or that it isn’t.
This post only proves the following I wrote.


But it just seems very unlikely why anyone would give away 1000 BTC? Even if it is the hacker and he is supposedly trying to launder his coins this way. Then he is not going to do it with 1000 BTC.
50 BTC at a time would be much better or perhaps even 10 BTC.

You guys better go for a walk outside and enjoy the fresh air. Wait for all of this to blow over and hope Bitfinex is able to somehow repay you guys.

Not that difficult, if you send 1 or 2 bitcoins to a mixer every week you can easily spend them without anyone knowing where you got them.

Some people lost a lot of money, trolling them with these stunts is respectless.
Just doing whatever you think is “fun” and not caring about someone’s pain is very egocentric.
I believe it’s sort of their own fault to store their BTC on an exchange (although everyone has had their BTC on an exchange at some point of time). Either way that doesn’t mean you can post shit like this and give everyone false hope.

This only proves he is rich and bored, but not that he is in fact the one that hacked Bitfinex.

Due to the faster block time and the faster difficulty adjustment of the Ethereum blockchain you can’t really compare the Ethereum Classic situation with Bitcoin.
If Ethereum had the same block time and difficulty adjustment as Bitcoin, Ethereum Classic wouldn’t have survived without another hard fork.
Since Ethereum Classic didn’t had any developers when it started there was nobody to code this hard fork.
If Bitcoin forks, the shortest chain is inevitably going to die…
The only way for that chain to survive is to pull of another hard fork to adjust the difficulty manually.

Bitcoin != Ethereum
And like points out we will need to increase the blocksize at some point in time. Even lighting needs bigger blocks. That’s why Core never said they don’t want a blocksize increase, they just don’t think it’s necessary right now.
You should read this: 
@_date: 2016-08-01 09:32:55
Well if Bitcoin Classic implements a hard fork to adjust the difficulty, it could technically even survive with 1 antminer.
But then the situation is already completely different from the Ethereum hard fork.
When Ethereum forked the old chain survived without any help from developers. This specific situation can’t happen to Bitcoin.
Let’s say for example Bitcoin Classic has 75% of the hashing power. Then you are already going to have a much longer block time. So it will take much longer to process transactions on this 75% “majority chain”. The idea behind the 75% consensus is **the assumption** that the 25% will jump ship because the block time of their network is even longer. (For example 1 block every 24 hours).
But it will just create a messy situation, because you don’t know when or if the 25% minority will jump ship. That’s why 95% would be much safer. If you have 95% you are pretty sure the 5% is going to jump ship because they don’t have any blocks.
What you are describing is effectively creating an altcoin. (Not that I call Classic an altcoin implementation, just from the technical point of view). If classic had only 50% and it wants to perform a hard fork (which the classic team doesn’t want, they want 75%). Then it would need to adjust the difficulty to survive. When this situation occurs the original chain that doesn’t forked will have to perform a hard fork as well to adjust the difficulty (because they lost 50% of their hash power in a short period of time). So in Bitcoin the shortest chain that doesnt pull of a hard fork will die, there is no escaping this.
Therefore Ethereum Classic can’t happen to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is much better protected from this shit then Ethereum.

Very true, at the moment the dollar is in some ways superior to Bitcoin. But you can’t expect Bitcoin to be on the same level as the dollar in less than a decade, it will take time.
When the Euro was introduced 17 years ago, it was distributed to every citizen in 1 day and it was immediately accepted by every merchant. Bitcoin has to achieve that the hard way, something that will take many decades.

What Europe, the northern European banks and the corrupt politicians in your country did to the Greece people was actually one of the reasons why I joined the Bitcoin revolution.
As other people have already told you in the replies, its good advice to be careful. Bitcoin is a very wild ride; don’t be surprised if we suddenly drop 40% out of the blue.

Your setup is fine, probably better than most people. Changes of someone breaking into your tails operating system are very small.
But it can always be better of-course. If you don't trust a Trezor you could use for example a 3-3 or 2-3 multisig setup with Electrum &amp; Tails, a Ledger Nano S and a Trezor. In such a setup they would have to break into/compromise all of your devices to steal your bitcoins.
But it will always be a bit of a choice between a user friendly experience and a secure setup.

It is used to trade the dollar vs the euro, just like people trade the dollar vs Bitcoin.


“blockchain” is a very inefficient way to create a database. Bitcoin uses it because it wouldn’t be able to survive without it. It would have been banned or shut down like every other e-coin that went before Bitcoin. There is nothing fancy about a “blockchain”, if you are going to do something where you won’t have to worry about a government banning your project you don’t need a blockchain. An ordinary webserver will be much more efficient. In fact, in most cases, even if you are going to do something "debatable" you don’t need a blockchain either. Silkroad never used a “blockchain” for example, neither does TOR or Bittorrent.


I have used Bitcoin for more than 3 years now as my bank account. I convert my salary to Bitcoin every month and when I need something I either buy euro’s or pay with Bitcoin directly whenever that’s an option.


Bitcoin has existed for almost a decade now; it has a solid amount of strong supporters like me that are never going to give up on it.

Development is far from centralized.
We have 3 competing teams when it comes to the backbone of the network, Classic, Unlimited and Core.
And there are loads of different wallet implementations besides Core, we have Mycelium, Electrum, blockchain.info and much more.
So development is most certainly not centralized, but I was talking about node and mining centralization. Because if we would drastically increase the blocklimit (8MB for example), we will heavily centralize both.

Just take a look at all the polls that the BU shills made.


That’s not very difficult. ;)


You just need to ask the right people, not random trolls on the internet. Ask every wallet, exchange, miner and so on that is involved in the Bitcoin industry and you will know what proposal most of the Bitcoin community will support and what not.
If you have every wallet, exchange and miner agreeing on a hardfork it’s not going to be a problem. ;)

does indeed have less censorship (aka moderation) in comparison to And although this might sound great initially, in the real world this means that without moderation you will be confronted with constant lies, conspiracy theories and altcoin pumpers on all trying to divide the Bitcoin community.
Personally I prefer but everyone is free to make their own decision. The internet doesn’t dictate you to stick to one forum.
But it’s pretty absurd to hold the Bitcoin developers accountable for the moderation on 1 forum that is completely out of their control. for example supports BU, but that doesn’t mean of-course that BU is responsible for the moderation on -
Hard forking towards new consensus rules developed by BU is incredibly dangerous and would even if it was successful only give us a very limited amount of scaling. But in the end it’s up to the Bitcoin community, the miners, the exchanges, the darknet markets and wallets like Electrum, Mycelium etc. to decide what consensus rules we agree on. The Core developers have no control over that.
The only goal of the Bitcoin developers is to write software which they think is best for Bitcoin. And if the Bitcoin community no longer agrees with the Core developers we are completely free to run software that is written by one of the other teams.
Therefore you can never blame developers for not doing what you think they should do. If you want something different in Bitcoin, you can contribute to the project yourself, you can also choose a different type of software and use that. And if you can’t find that software you can write it yourself.
Bitcoin is completely open-source.
The Core developers simply believe increasing the blocklimit trough a hard fork will give us too little scaling and too much risk.
What would you do if someone is trying to force you to do something that you think will impose great risks on Bitcoin and could heavily centralize Bitcoin? Would you stick to your own believes? Or would you gave in to the pressure of the miners and implement this change in the software even though you think it is dangerous?
What ViaBTC is trying to do is divide the community by spreading a twisted reality. And their latest paragraph about other cryptocurrency’s, shows their intentions. ViaBTC doesn’t care about Bitcoin, their only goal is to let it die.
Luckily they are failing, that’s why they are doing desperate things like putting these lies on their website.

I respect your opinion (and agree with all of what you wrote) but personally I like the moderation on a lot.
We should never tolerate the stuff I described in my post and most certainly not shit like this for example: 
The world of Bitcoin (and Cryptocurrency in general) is a very violent world with heavy politics. A world where passionate people, developers and businesses get attacked and trolled from all sides. Communities getting infiltrated by competing currencies and other organizations with only 1 agenda to split the community.
In my opinion strong moderation is a necessity especially in the Bitcoin world.
Although I have to admit that the moderation on might have made the blocksize debate a lot worse. But I don’t think we could have prevented that.

I wouldn’t call 75% a tiny number of pools. :P
Besides they aren’t blocking Segregated Witness, they have indicated many times that they are in favor of Segregated Witness and they are fully aware that Segregated Witness is a blocksize increase. But they would simply also like to see a blocksize increase for non segwit data.
And if we could get some sort of compromise we can break the status quo that we have currently created. And once we have Segregated Witness, Core can start to work on Schnorr signatures. :P
So if a compromise could get us forward I think we should go for it. :P

I know. :P
That’s why it has support from most of the users, wallets and exchanges. But as a lot of miners have indicated, they would also like to see a blocklimit increase for non Segwit data.
So if we could make some sort of compromise we can get Segregated Witness and Schnorr sooner.
If we do nothing we might be stuck in this status quo forever. :P

It seems that I indeed misunderstood it. :(
My apologies and thank you for the correction.
I corrected my reply.
The following information provided by Peter Todd was kinda what I meant why non Segwit data is still limited to the old 1MB cap when Segwit activates.

I can confirm those numbers, my node does about the same.

Well he is sort of correct, blocks are getting full and raising the fee is not a scaling solution of-course.
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:36:54


It’s unlikely anyone is going to use a chain that only has 5% of the hashrate and 100% of the difficulty. ;)
That would mean a blocktime of 3.5 hours and a difficulty adjustment period of 10 months. ;)
95% is more than sufficient.
But when you do a hardfork miners are less important, the most important thing is users, exhanges, darknet markets, wallets and so on. Everyone needs to upgrade, but if you plan it 2 years ahead I doubt this will be a problem.


Dude that was your poll. xD
And everyone could submit as many times as they wanted. That’s not a very good indication of what the Bitcoin community wants.
Determining what the Bitcoin community wants is simply imposible. :)
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:44:40
Segregated Witness is indeed a blocksize increase, because it creates a separate block ~~to store the signatures.~~ But it doesn’t increase the blocklimit for non Segwit transactions.
So it’s understandable why some people would also like to see a blocklimit increase. :P
The smoothest way forward at this point would be a compromise. So let’s for once be a little bit constructive, instead of coming up with the same arguments as always.
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:03:09


We already have that, what you are suggesting is giving the miners even more power than they already have. :P


Its not that simple. :P
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:17:50
Not if those blocks are full. ;)
Filling up the last 5% of a 1MB block will cost you about the same as filling up the last 5% of a 2MB block.


Sadly 32MB blocks aren’t possible for various reasons, for example RAM, CPU and storage will become a problem as well as the following subject:

@_date: 2017-02-28 19:05:55


Of-course we need more people. :P
We need the entire world to be able to use Bitcoin. And that’s why we are going to need every single piece of scaling we can possibly think off.
And the first step to reach all of that is Segregated Witness.
Once we have Segregated Witness it will also have less of an impact on the network to increase the blocklimit.
@_date: 2017-02-26 13:32:27


Blockstream didn’t hire Core devs, core devs created Blockstream. This is great, because now they can work 24/7 on Bitcoin and even get paid to do so. (Just like BU gets paid by a private company btw)


It doesn’t matter, Bitcoin is open-source you can check the code they make. If they write something that is malicious to Bitcoin it won’t be adopted.


What do you want to do about this? We can currently process 3 transactions per second, which is almost nothing. If we want to serve the world we need to be able to process tens of thousands of transactions per second.
The only proposal you guys come up with is increasing the blocklimit, although this is surely something we might need to do in the future. It isn’t really a scaling solution. Because even with 8MB blocks we will still not be able to sufficiently scale Bitcoin. But it will put huge stress on nodes, centralize mining even more, and it will require a hardfork which could split the chain. Which is a huge risk to take if you take into account how insanely big Bitcoin has become.
That’s why the Core developers developed Segregated Witness, SW can increase the blocksize without a hardfork. It does all sort of cool things for hardware wallets, and it will make it much more user friendly to use the Lightning network. It will also make it possible to implement Schnorr signatures which could give us another 100% increase in on-chain capacity.


1MB might sound like a very tiny amount of data, but it actually isn’t. With 1MB blocks my full node is currently consuming 1500 GB of upload bandwidth every month, 2GB of RAM, some CPU power when it needs to calculate a large transaction and a lot of storage. Altough storage is the least of the problems.
You might also want to read the following: 


I agree, communication by the Core devs was horrible. :P
But you can’t blame them for that, they are coders not politicians.
@_date: 2017-02-22 11:36:58
There is a lot more we can do between 1 and 2 without increasing the blocklimit. :P
On-chain scaling still has a long way to go.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:59:49


Personally I would be in favor of such a proposal, in my opinion that’s a very safe way to activate a hardfork and also probably the best way to increase the blocksize.
I would put a limit on the increase tough, probably something like a max of 32MB.
@_date: 2017-02-18 13:51:32
Somewhere between now and the 11th of March.
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:00:05
Whenever I meet people that are new to Bitcoin they often fear developments like this might be a danger to Bitcoin, which is an understandable rookie mistake.
The truth is that this would only make Bitcoin stronger.
A cryptocurrency created by the government, controlled by the government in a centralized system that is subjected to inflation is exactly the same as what we currently have and what people are trying to escape by buying Bitcoin.
But one of the things that can sometimes make it hard to buy Bitcoins is when you try to transfer money from your bank account to an exchange. But if the PBOC would develop their own cryptocurrency that is pegged to the Renminbi it would be much easier to buy Bitcoins. :)
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:23:51
Segregated Witness doesn't increase the blocklimit, but it does increase the blocksize. It creates a separate block in which it stores the signatures, which will be very effective for multisig transactions (and a lot of other stuff).
And since multisig transactions are increasing with the rise of applications like BitSquare, Hansa and OpenBazaar for example. Segregated Witness will be a great way to increase capacity.
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:00:45


I know, and personally I think Segregated Witness + Schnorr signatures are probably more than enough for a long time. But I can also sort of understand why some people would like to see a blocklimit increase.
And I think if Core plans it properly like the proposal Luke made, it’s doable.
Either way I would love to see some compromise. :P
Anything to get us forward.


Yea I made a mistake, someone else also corrected me. :)

You are scaring the newbies with your FUD. :P
BU needs at least 75% (80% is what they said themselves) to hard fork, so as long as Segregated Witness has more than 25% (2016 block average) we are doing fine.

Technically you’re correct if it isn’t activated before that date there won’t be a blocksize decrease. But I would remove that rule either way. It’s unlikely anybody is going to agree on a blocksize decrease at this stage anyway. Pretty much everyone wants a blocksize increase, some trough Segregated Witness and some trough a hardfork.


I doubt it’s going to be very hard when you plan it 2 years ahead. Many parties have indicated they welcome a small blocklimit increase. And I doubt they will reject it in 2020.

With Bitcoin it’s a bit more difficult than a tiny altcoin without an industry build around it.
For example every single altcoin is traded in Bitcoin, so if we split the network how will those altcoins be measured? In the original Bitcoin or the Bitcoin Unlimited chain?
And what chain are we going to call Bitcoin? And who gets to decide what is Bitcoin and what will be the altcoin?
How are we going to explain to outsiders that there are suddenly twice as much Bitcoins?
What will the darknetmarkets do? Are they all going to update their website? Are they going to support both chains? Will drug users understand any of this?
Which chain will the Bitcoin ATM’s start to sell and buy?
What chain will Mycelium and Electrum support? They indicated they prefer Segregated Witness, but what will they do when the chain splits? Will they add both coins to their wallet? Or will they release 2 versions of their wallet?
People often bring up Ethereum as an example, but for Ethereum it was much easier. Their industry was and still is very small compared to Bitcoin and there aren’t as many parties involved.

You really think miners care about my little node when EC gets enough support? I will be simply kicked of the network. xD
Everyone will be either forced to just accept every block the miners create, or they risk being thrown off the network.
Can you imagine the panic when Poloniex for example is no longer being able to receive any Bitcoin transactions because they don’t support the latest blocklimit?


I strongly disagree with that. :P


A PoW change is way too extreme and incredibly dangerous. That’s like America saying we can always nuke Russia when they start to behave badly. :P


I hope we can find something that will make everyone happy. At the moment doing nothing is probably the best. It’s in everyone’s interest to find a solution to this problem, so I am sure we will figure something out. 
Either way, splitting the network would be horrible. Bitcoin is the strongest when we all stand united.

Bitcoin has value because it is decentralized. If Bitcoin can only operate in centralized datacenters it’s completely worthless. First of all, if you would like to operate a currency in a centralized datacenter you could just as well use a database, you don’t need a fancy blockchain for that purpose. 
And second of all, if Bitcoin is completely centralized in datacenters, the government could just ban it and it’s done. 
If the government bans it and they turn off the 5 nodes that are running in 2 datacenters, you might say well screw the government I will just run my Bitcoin node behind TOR in my own home. Well you can’t anymore because the blockchain is 500 terabytes and there is nowhere to download it…

Sorry typo :)
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:18:39


I doubt it…
Increasing the blocklimit might be an option, but it will be difficult to get everyone on board (I know everyone is impossible), but we would need to get at least the biggest exchanges, merchants, darknetmarkets, wallets, miners and so on to join.
But emergent consensus (that BU is proposing) is rather radical. It changes the entire way Bitcoin works and it gives a huge amount of power to miners in general, but most importantly the larger miners profit from it (centralizing mining even more). Which is one of the reasons why smaller miners are not supporting it (like [1Hash]( for example.
EC (emergent consensus) can also lead to random forks, which makes zero confirmation transactions impossible (although that was never recommended). But with EC you will need to wait at least 6 blocks to make sure your transaction is valid instead of 2.
It has loads of other problems too, which is why [F2Pool declared it dead]( And other parties (exchanges and wallets) refuse to support it. So EC is not really an option.
Increasing the blocklimit with both Segregated Witness and a hardfork, very unlikely but possible. But EC is really way too extreme.

That wouldn’t be a great idea. :P
It would only make it easier for them to run a node because they will need to connect to fewer peers. Most of the BU supporters don’t understand how much resources it takes to run a node. They have little understanding of how Bitcoin works and when they hear 1MB every 10 minutes they think that’s easy because most of the pictures they upload to facebook are larger than that. :P
They have no glue how much resources you need to relay 1MB blocks trough the network and how much it costs to share a 110GB blockchain.
I say let them experience how much resources it takes, perhaps it will enlighten them.
To the BU guys that are reading this, my node currently consumes 1500GB a month on upload bandwidth, 2GB of RAM, a bit of CPU power and 110GB of hard drive space (although that’s the easy part).
If you guys increase the blocklimit to 8MB I will need to upload 12TB every month.
Think about that!

Don't forget [Roger Ver]( ;)
But in reality this is a silly way of thinking.
Altcoins always follow Bitcoin, Bitcoin has been rising very sharply for the past 5 months and when it finally stabilizes altcoins start to follow. It has always been that way.
As you can see in the picture, altcoins are traded in Bitcoin. So hardforking Bitcoin will also hurt the altcoin trade. And when Bitcoin goes down there will be no new money flowing into the crypto-currency industry.
That’s also why Erik Voorhees has been so afraid of a potential hardfork: 
Therefore it is silly to think Roger or Jihan would be doing this to pump altcoins.
Altcoins are a supplement to Bitcoin, slightly more risk and sometimes slightly more reward. If you know what you’re doing altcoins can be a great way to get more Bitcoins. :)

Yes, but at least it was clear what the limit was.
What happens when EC activates and 85% of the miners support for example 8MB blocks, but 15% can’t handle that size?
Those smaller miners will be kicked from the network.
Then a year later again 85% of the miners support 16MB blocks, but 15% can’t handle that. Again they will be kicked from the network.
Mining will heavily centralize around the largest miners with the best internet connections.
But most importantly users (exchanges, wallets, merchants, darknetmarkets) will have no idea how big the blocks might get. And they will have zero control over it. A darknetmarket for example would want to run its own node. But what happens when they can no longer do so?

The Bitcoin developers are very skilled professionals, they don’t need a hardfork to upgrade Bitcoin.


If a hardfork is not contentious and the entire community supports it (wallets, exchanges, miners, darknetmarkets, merchants, users) then there isn’t a problem and the hardfork will become Bitcoin.
But increasing the blocklimit through a hardfork when we don’t need too, because there are safer solutions available will always be contentious.

The Bitcoin Unlimited chain would need to sacrifice 30% of the original hashrate to attack the original chain. Which will leave the Bitcoin Unlimited chain with only 45% of the hashrate (assuming they are able to get 75% of the original hashrate before the fork.)
It seems highly unlikely they would do that, let alone be able to organize such an attack.

Typical [behavior]( to spread these lies.
Fiverr stopped accepting Bitcoin more than 2 months ago and it wasn’t because of 30 cent fees: 
This is the post that is spreading the fake news btw: 
Notice how they are giving the impression that fees are 2 dollars when they are in fact [60 cents](
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:47:55


Nop, just people fighting back and some new pools joined. :)
btw, we have just reached **38%** (24 hour window). :D
@_date: 2017-03-29 20:27:16
So it seems both [F2Pool]( and BW Pool want to stay neutral and don’t support anything controversial. :P
And Segregated Witness has more than [25% support]( which is sufficient to block BU.
Which means unless all sides stop acting like children, Bitcoin will stay the same and keeps working perfectly as it always has. And scaling will happen trough things like [RSK]( for example.
@_date: 2017-03-30 15:37:10


That’s not true. :P
@_date: 2017-03-30 17:44:33


1. Without commit access that will be very difficult. 
2. The people that are currently working for blockstream haven’t really changed. for example still says the same things he said years ago. So it’s not because they are working for blockstream they have suddenly changed their minds.
3. It’s also important to realize that blockstream is a Bitcoin company, if they hurt Bitcoin they will hurt themselves.
4. Everything Core does is open-source, so I can check everything they create. And I personally love Segregated Witness because I have always been a strong proponent of bigger blocks (I even was a classic supporter for a little while). And Segregated Witness is like the perfect compromise, no hard fork, in combination with Schnorr it gives 150% extra on-chain capacity and it enables Lightning. So the small blockers get lightning and the big blockers get bigger blocks (and we don’t even need a hard fork), perfect compromise. :)
5. As you can see with the current crisis, Core isn’t in control. Bitcoin was created in a way that nobody has control. This is a lesson that we are currently learning the hard way. We either cooperate with each other or nothing happens.


Very true. :P
You should join our new movement to Unify Bitcoin. :D
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:32:26
Fees are already going through the roof and people are still using Bitcoin. And if they stop using Bitcoin fees will automaticly go down.
And after those 2 months of waiting for the next difficulty adjustment we will finally get Segregated Witness which will increase capacity and get us all sorts of cool stuff.
And I wouldn’t be surprised if Bitfury and some other pools fire up some old hardware after the fork. This way we will have a difficulty adjustment much sooner. It will also be very profitable for them to do so because they can be sure the difficulty won’t change as fast as it usually does. :)
Besides, most trade happens off-chain on the exchanges, so the people that determine the price will feel no effect of this decrease in transaction throughput. That’s why you never see the price of Bitcoin decline when there are a lot of unconfirmed transactions.


I will keep using the original chain as long as it has more than 5% of the hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:00:44


That’s not the point, this means we are not going to see a controversial hardfork play out.
Because Segregated Witness has been above 25% for a long time, forces are balanced once again.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:59:36
There is not going to be a hardfork. :P
This is politics, for noobs not really anything to worry about.

@_date: 2017-03-27 13:11:52
A hardfork to increase the blocklimit is already on the Core roadmap, which will be done after we have increased on-chain capacity with Segwit and Schnorr.


If only it was that simple. :P
BU people don’t actually want to increase on-chain capacity, if they wanted to do so they would support Segwit. BU only wants to get control of the protocol and give more power to the miners. That’s why they are never going to agree to a compromise, they want Bitcoin to be centralized and they want full control.
Do you really think that EC from BU will increase the blocklimit? Of-course not, the miners might increase it 1 time towards 1.2 maybe 2mb and then they will leave it at that. There is no guarantee that once the miners have control they will actually increase on-chain capacity.
Segregated Witness was the compromise Core made, because it increases on-chain capacity by 150% (Segwit+Schnorr) **and** it enables lightning. And as a bonus it does all sort of other cool things as well.
@_date: 2017-03-11 19:39:30
Let’s hope you’re right. :P
Even though I am not a fan of Bitcoin Unlimited I would rather have a clean hardfork than a chain split.


I doubt it. :P
Bitfury is trying to get [30% of the network]( And I doubt they are going to switch to Bitcoin Unlimited.

If you look at the 24 hour window (the little stripe) (yea I know variance) we are currently even at 38%.
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:30:16
Your fee was a little bit low, but not too low. So that slows it down a little bit.
And blocks are generated at a random interval so you never know how long it takes for a transaction to confirm. On average it takes about 15 minutes.
With your fee I think it will take an hour.

Nobody has full control over Bitcoin and certainly not the miners. Even though they would love you to think they do. ;)
Why do you think miners don’t just raise the blockreward up to 100 Bitcoins per block?
Because merchants, exchanges, darknetmarkets, wallets, users and so on won’t accept those blocks.
Miners have just as much control as normal users, they either follow the consensus rules or their blocks will be rejected.
If the community wants to change the consensus rules we need everyone to get on board, not just the miners.
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:37:44
There is for people like you. ;)
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:43:55
Everything above 25% support is perfect to keep the community united and avoid a chain split. And with the current amount of hashpower that supports segwit we are not going to get below that number anymore as you can see in the graph.
btw, this one might be better: 
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:08:32
At this point it’s very unlikely we are going to see a network split, so I wouldn’t worry about it. But if it does occur (hypothetically) you will most likely get coins on both chains so you will be fine if you keep using blockchain.info.
If you want to be safe you can use a wallet where you control the private keys yourself (electrum or a paper wallet for example).
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:49:34

Even if the original chain only has 25% of the original hashrate, it will barely feel any impact. The miners that keep mining on this chain will still get the same blockreward at exactly the same interval because they are mining against the difficulty not against other miners.
So the only thing that changes for the original chain it that is will have a blocktime of 40 minutes. But most of the industry (exchanges, darknetmarkets, wallets and merchants) will still support the original chain. Therefore it will still be dominant and the only thing that changes is a slightly longer blocktime. 


Bitfury, BTCC and Telco are not going to follow the Bitcoin Unlimited chain. :P
They won’t have any reason to do so.

Also known as centralization…


Its not about storage, but about a combination of all factors (RAM, storage, CPU and bandwidth). It will also become exponentially (not linear) harder to verify blocks when the blocksize increases.


Not if you have to run your node behind TOR.

1.7MB was true a year ago, but with the amount of multisig transactions that we do today, because of websites like Hansa. Segregated Witness would give us 2.1MB blocks.
And once Segregated Witness is activated we can get Schnorr signatures, which would give us another 50%.
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:18:10
If you want to achieve something don’t use Reddit. :P
Talk to real people, not random trolls on the internet. The trolls over here might not even be real Bitcoin users at all, but simply people with an “agenda” and a purpose to keep this division alive and make it worse.
Talk to the Bitcoin community (exchanges, miners, darknetmarkets, wallet developers, node developers, merchants and so on), but never use Reddit.
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:21:50
Segregated Witness has been gaining a lot of mining support lately and it hasn’t been under 25% in a long time. This means we are not going to see a hardfork (at least not without support from the **entire** community).
If people want to hardfork Bitcoin they are going to need at least 75% to 80% mining support (perhaps even more) plus community support. And at the moment neither side will ever acquire this as long as the subject is so controversial.
In a short summary, balance has once again been restored in the shire, Bitcoin is still and always has been working great and it is forcing us to either come to consensus or (if we keep acting like children) Bitcoin (with its enormous network and long block times) will make sure the hodlers are protected from a chain split.

@_date: 2016-06-25 17:49:34
Well to achieve very very very cheap transactions for the masses as soon as possible we need to have something like the lightning network as soon as possible. But to create an incentive for the lightning network (off-chain), transactions on-chain need to be more expensive then transactions off-chain.
Else why would people use the lightning network, if it is just as cheap to use onchain transactions?
The whole idea of the lightning network is that an on-chain transaction will cost about 1 dollar (for example) but if you use the lightning network you will share that transactions with 10.000 (for example) other off-chain transactions. This way an on-chain transaction will cost you a dollar and an lightning transaction that gives you more anonymity and instant confirmation will cost you 0,01 cents. Because you share the 1 dollar fee with 10.000 other transactions.
But even with lightning we still need bigger blocks for 2 reasons. First because even with fees as high as a dollar. It would only cost around 1700 dollars to fill up a block with spam. So to prevent spam attacks that result in people having to wait longer for a confirmation you need to have more expensive on-chain transactions and also slightly bigger blocks for example 10 MB.
The second reason is that even off-chain transactions need to settle back on the blockchain at a certain point. And ones mass adoption starts 1MB is just not going to be enough not even if everyone uses lightning.
So why not increase the block size right now?
Well this has become very political and will result in heavy opinions ones you start asking such a question. And both sides have very strong arguments.
But one of the arguments to not increase the block size until lighting is ready or almost ready is that if you increase the block size right now to let’s say 4 MB. Fees will rapidly decrease and will be 4 times cheaper. Which is good, but at the same time the incentive to invest time in the lightning network and to actually use it is gone.
The philosophy is we first need to create an incentive to need, develop and eventually start using offchain transactions. And then ones lightning is operational we can carefully increase the blocksize.
We will never know when mass adoption starts, but in my opinion its best to be prepared for it as soon as possible. And although I am sort of pro big blocks. The lightning network is just a much better solution, the blockchain will just get to big if you increase blocks to infinity and waiting 30 minutes for a transaction to confirm is not that great either.

@_date: 2016-06-22 21:23:48
Well it was a sort of response to some other comments but those where deleted, so now it looks strange. But I was talking about the amount of unconfirmed transactions, when I posted my previous message, this number was not very large yet (compared to busier days). :)
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:14:09
The only one that fully works for blockstream is Pieter Wuille. Luke is sort of an advisor, and Matt Corallo sometimes does a little bit of work for blockstream (but for some reason he is not on the list you refer to).
And just because you contribute to the Core project doesn’t really have to mean a lot. I could do a little translation in the code (like 1 commit), but does that make me a Core developer?
It’s important to look at the amount of work they do for the Core project. For example the ones that actually have commit access (Wladimir van der Laan, Jonas Schnelli and Marco Falke) are not employed by blockstream. They all get their funds in other ways.


Nop Peter also gets paid in other ways.
You also wrote down 14 people and only 5 of them (according to you) work for blockstream, so that’s not half. And most of them only have very small contributions to the code.


I also “lobby” (support) Segregated Witness, there is nothing wrong with that.
And in the end why does it matter that a company pays the developers? Even in the current debate we all want the same thing and that is for Bitcoin to scale. :P

Your transaction will probably be cleared from the electrum node pretty soon. :)
Blockchain.info was just a little bit earlier.
But if you cant wait for that you can start electrum, then click on wallet in the menu and then click on private keys and export. You will be asked for you password and after that you private keys are shown. Copy the one that belongs to the address you used to send the Bitcoins in this transactions and import it a new electrum wallet. :)

He is right that there is no great conspiracy by the media, but the article is still shit. They make a lot of assumptions, including that Bitcoin will process all transactions on-chain, that Bitcoin will become 3200 times bigger (3.2GB blocks lol) and that all miners will start to use the energy from coal (instead of the hydro power they are currently using for the most part).

You cannot really make that judgement by looking at a graph.
In theory we could have 100% mining support by tomorrow, although that's unlikely of-course.

Very true.
@_date: 2016-06-22 19:58:11
While its true that blocks are a little bit full at the moment.
In this case I would say your fee was too low. So it will take a little bit more time to confirm.
If you use the following website next time, you can see what fee you should use. :)

Yep, can be very exiting sometimes :)
I tried to trade when I started years ago, but it didn’t work out. Hodling is much more relaxed. :P

In theory you could argue that it might compromise user privacy. But in what way would it compromise the privacy of the wallet in general?
For WasabiWallet its beneficial to have as many users as possible. So it makes sense to support multiple operating systems. If you as a user think Ubuntu or another operating system is a safer option for you, WasabiWallet gives you the option to make that choice.

It wouldn’t make a difference sadly. :(
What the FIOD is currently planning to do is consider everyone that holds Bitcoin or any other crypto-currency a criminal unless an individual can prove the opposite.
So where people long ago where protected by their civil rights that they are innocent unless proven differently. By what they are currently planning to do is making everyone a criminal by default. :(
For example if someone would sell his Bitcoin on an exchange with KYC he will have to prove how he got his coins. And if he can’t deliver sufficient evidence that person will be treated as a criminal and get arrested.
The only way to protect yourself from this madness is buying and selling your Bitcoins with cash.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:17:20
Usually when people buy all at once they feel bad when Bitcoin suddenly crashes shortly after they bought. If you buy in intervals (dollar cost averaging it’s called) you can buy more during a dip.
Its simple psychology, humans need to feel like they got a good deal.
If you truly understand the potential of Bitcoin and believe in the long term growth, it doesn’t matter how much you buy right now and you can spend the 1500 dollar all at once. Just hodl those coins and enjoy the ride.

You will have your coins on both chains.


Its best to control your own private keys when a hardfork happens. This way you can be sure you will have your coins on both chains. So don’t store your coins on an exchange.


At the moment all wallets support Segregated Witness, so it seems unlikely they will support BU.


Nobody knows, but a split won’t be good that’s for sure.
In the best scenario 1 chain dies, but if BU gets enough hash power it seems unlikely that 1 chain is going to die. Because Core also has plenty of hash power to survive.
The positive side of a split would be that we lose all the hashpower that is blocking Segregated Witness. So on the Core chain Segregated Witness will immediately have full support. But the downside will be that the time between blocks will be much longer (40 minutes with the current 25% hashpower). And it will take about 2 months for the difficulty to adjust assuming we will be left with 25% of the hashpower.
But in general it will be horrible for the reputation of Bitcoin, if such a scenario would unfold.

Miners will be able to choose the blocksize just like it is right now, but BU will certainly remove the blocklimit!
Blocklimit and blocksize are two different things.
But miners don't care how big a block gets. They will make it as big as possible to include as many transactions as possible so they can earn more money. Maybe not at first, but slowly and steadily they will increase the blocksize, blocks will be filled with spam transactions from governments and banks that will try to destroy Bitcoin by making it implode on itself.
Miners don't care about the small node operators that are volunteering and keeping Bitcoin decentralized. Miners don't care that those node operators now need an extreme Internet connection and a huge amount of storage, RAM and CPU power to verify all the blocks.
Removing the limit will heavily centralize Bitcoin.
And thats without mentioning the huge risks of hardforking without full support from the community.

Very innovative once again from [blockchain.info](
While Electrum is already working on Lightning support, [blockchain.info]( doesn't even have segwit. But instead of improving their wallet they decided to pay Ledger a lot of money to put the Blockchain logo on a Leger nano clone and sell it at a higher price. :|
Fine if you want to add a hardware wallet option to your interface, but why create a new product instead of adding support for existing hardware wallets like Trezor and Ledger.

**Roger Ver:** Well mister "developer" I want *you* to let the network scale with a blocklimit increase to 16mb, still keep the network decentralized and make sure the network can’t be split in two.
**Developer:** Well mister Ver that’s simply impossible. With the current 1MB blocklimit, nodes are already [struggling](  And a 16 MB blocklimit might sound great, but in reality it doesn’t give us that much scaling at all.
At the moment we can process 3 transactions per second which is next to nothing. Multiply 16 with nothing and you still have barely any scaling, but you would put the network at enormous stress. It would also require a hardfork and since I can never be 100% sure that every wallet, darknetmarket, exchange, shop and every Bitcoin user in the world would adopt that hardfork it might split the network in two. So it would be a huge risk to do this.
**Roger Ver:** “Impossible” what does that even mean?
**Developer:** Well I might have a good solution called Segregated Witness. It enables us to process twice as much transactions, it can be done as a softfork so we don’t risk splitting the network, it doesn’t put a lot of stress on nodes so we can keep the network decentralized. And most importantly it makes better scaling solutions possible like Lightning, tumblebit, Schnorr and all sorts of great things.
Roger Ver goes completely mental and tries to hijack the network.

It could and in my opinion it’s very likely to happen eventually, but it will take a lot of time before we get to that point. At least 10 to 20 more years.
Bitcoin needs more time to acuire liquidity and get a more stable price. We also need to further distribute Bitcoin around the population, make sure everyone has at least a few bits or knows how to acquire Bitcoins and is capable of downloading a wallet.
We also need Lightning to handle the transaction volume, which we should get very soon thanks to Segwit.

Volume always decreases after a bubble. You should compare it to the volume before the bubble.

Because even with Lightning you can’t fit the entire world in a 1mb block. That's why we will need to increase the blocklimit at some point.

Hashrate has dropped a bit in the past 2 days, which means the average blocktime has increased. Which causes your transaction to take longer to get some confirmations. 
But the difficulty will readjust and therefore decrease in 2 days, which will decrease the average blocktime. At the same time Segregated Witness will activate, giving Bitcoin a bit of extra on-chain capacity. 
So it will improve soon, but for now we will have to deal with the current situation.
If you want your Bitcoin transaction to go through fast you can use the following website to check what fee is currently recommended.

Litecoin is not your avarage pump&amp;dump shitcoin. It has in fact been incredibly stable for a very long period of time. And a few hours before everyone thought the signaling would start it shot up with a huge amount of volume. And it suddenly became the top traded currency on Polo.
For Litecoin that’s very unusual.
It’s currently down again because signaling didn’t actually start:

It gives an unfair advantage to a few miners, making mining very centralized. So getting rid of AsicBoost is a really good thing for Bitcoin.
But getting rid of AsicBoost is not what Segregated Witness is about, disabling AsicBoost is just a tiny part of Segwit.
@_date: 2017-01-24 21:05:17
I completely agree with you, as Bitcoin enthusiasts we would stand stronger united.
But I am afraid that’s going to be a thing of the past.
In the beginning the forces that we are fighting, ignored us. They thought decentralized money wasn’t anything they would have to worry about. They thought it didn’t scale. But with every day that Bitcoin lives, it grows stronger and stronger. And the stronger it gets the more our community will get infiltrated by government and company lobbyist’s that will try to divide us.
It’s just the way the world works sadly. 
Luckily Bitcoin is much stronger that most people realize and I am confident that whatever happens, Bitcoin can overcome anything.

Very unpopular opinion probably, but I actually like Mycelium a lot and I cant find any half decent alternatives compared to their incredible user interface.
Besides, I don’t mind them making a little money with some advertisements. And most importantly the commercials are either Trezor and Ledger (in the business tab), which are great Bitcoin company’s.
And the RMC thing is a Russian Bitcoin mining company, which could help decentralize Bitcoin mining.
So personally I am okay with these advertisements. If it helps them get some extra funds, who cares. They need to find a way to earn some money anyway.

Usually it’s very random, Bitcoin is very volatile and crashes very regularly but it always recovers stronger.

In 2015 the Greece crisis drove the Bitcoin price upwards from about 218 dollars towards 310 dollars. And it seems the Greece debt Crisis might be coming back in 2017. And this time it will come together with elections in France, Germany, the Netherlands and possibly Italy making it even more difficult to come to agreements between the EU and the Greece government.
Although in theory Bitcoin could help the Greece people with the problems they are facing. In practice it probably won’t. Andreas gave a good explanation about this: 
But what it will do is cause panic in the Eurozone and a possible devaluation of the Euro. This doesn’t mean of-course that every European will buy Bitcoin. Most people will probably do nothing and just get a little bit poorer. But since Bitcoin is still very small, even if a tiny part of the European population chooses to buy a little bit of Bitcoin to protect their selves from a devaluation of the Euro it could lead to another rise of Bitcoin, similar to Brexit for example.
So yet another point we can add to the long list of things that will occur in 2017 that will be very positive for the Bitcoin price.

He used to be a great guy and a very big Bitcoin investor (he is one of the people that got me into Bitcoin), and since he is a fellow Bitcoiner I still sort of like him.
But he represents a group of people that are less informed and would like to let Bitcoin fully scale on-chain.
This is something that might sound great at first, because it would give us very low mining fees. And we can process much more transactions suddenly. That’s why a lot of people fall for that movement initially, until they learn more about how Bitcoin works.


He alone isn’t, but if he can convince enough people (miners, exchanges, wallets, users) to support him his movement becomes important.

Fully agree.
The problem is also that Bitcoin has grown incredibily large. Its not only big exchanges but also smaller users and for example the darknetmarkets. Even if one of them upgrades to late it will be one big mess.
Thats why you need to carefully plan a posible hardfork.
So I really hope we can find some sort of compromise. :P
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:35:30
In that case its probable best to do the following&gt;
Go to Tools&gt;Preferences&gt;Fees
Then disable dynamic fees and fill in 0.001 BTC/kB, which should be sufficient currently. But you should normally check 
Electrum kind of sucks when you don’t know what you’re doing. In your case it’s probably best to use something simpler like Mycelium for example.

No, you the individual are in full control of your own money when you use Bitcoin. It’s sort of like a Swiss bank account, without taking the risk of putting your money on the bank.

If someone tries to buy 60 billion worth of BTC today the price would go insanely high, the price would have to go to a million per coin minimum. 
But in reality this probably isn’t even possible because there aren’t that many coins on the exchanges.
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:28:53
Well the fee you paid was 7 cents, and the current recommended fee is arround 14 cents. So I doubt it will confirm in an hour. But it all depends on the amount of transactions that are coming in.
If you have control over the private keys of your bitcoins you could try to resend them with an appropriate fee. If not you will have to wait a few more hours.

Use a wallet on a safe platform where you control your own privatekeys like Trezor, Ledger, Mycelium or Samurai wallet for example.

That’s technically not possible. :P


Give it a bit more time than 2 days.
Most of the backlog we are currently experiencing is caused because we lost 50% of the total hashpower. So the average blocktime has increased to 20 minutes. This means we lost half of our capacity.
This should be fixed as soon as the difficulty readjusts.

In Holland we have iDEAL, which is free and instant and accepted in every web shop. Decentralized cryptocurrency’s can never compete with that. But that’s not a problem because cryptocurrency’s aren’t trying to compete with things like Paypal and iDEAL.
Centralized systems will always be more efficient and faster than decentralized systems.
We use decentralized systems for different reasons.

Most wallets and business have already implemented Segwit. So once Segwit is activated it won’t take long before all transactions are Segwit transactions. So what you are saying isn’t true.
But either way it doesn’t matter, malleability shouldn’t be a problem for an exchange. It’s only a problem for ViaBTC because ViaBTC is incompetent.
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:21:26
The people behind ViaBTC are really insanely stupid. xD
Opposing Segwit for ages and then getting hit with a transaction malleability attack on their shitcoin. :D
This is almost just as hilarious as when they were going to activate Segwit on Litecoin and told people that was the first time the read about it. When they had already been criticizing it for months. xD
@_date: 2016-11-03 19:21:22


I have done neither.
I gave a guy a url where he can buy a Bitcoin miner. I don’t see why that’s such a huge problem to you.
My apologies if I made you upset with a reddit post.

Currently Segwit is the only solution that is fully developed.


In theory yes, practically it wouldn’t be useable without Segwit.

Well to quote &gt; only witness (signature) data can take advantage of this blocksize increase; non-witness data is still limited to 1MB total per block.
At the moment we don’t yet have Segregated Witness let alone Lightning. It will take some time before Segregated Witness will activate and after it’s activated it will take even more time before wallets and exchanges have implemented it.
So to not let the network get jammed some argue that we should have a small blocklimit increase for the short term.


Well as Peter Todd said Segregated Witness does not increase the blocklimit for nog witness data.
But I am personally all in favor for Segregated Witness and I think it’s a much better scaling solution than simply increasing the blocklimit.
I am only saying that it would be a great political solution to increase the blocklimit. Because without a small blocklimit increase we are not going to get support from the miners.
And in a worst case scenario BU might hijack Bitcoin. :P
So we need to start talking with the miners, because the dark side is talking to them too. :P
@_date: 2016-11-17 10:39:59
I fully agree with you, but sometimes being right isn’t enough.
Besides, a small blocklimit increase isn’t going to hurt Bitcoin. said it himself that 2 or 4mb wouldn’t be a problem. According to Core increasing the blocklimit is just not a proper scaling solution. I fully agree with that, but it would be a great political solution.


Of-course it can, Bitcoin is being divined by humans. And humans can be influenced.
You can close your eyes and pretend nothing is happening. Or you can join the political game and be smarter than them.

@_date: 2017-08-16 16:45:49
Bitcoin needs a little bit more time I think.
We need to further distribute Bitcoin around the population, make sure everyone has at least a few bits or knows how to acquire Bitcoins and is capable of downloading a wallet.
And we also need a bit more liquidity. 
We also need Lightning and Segwit to handle the transaction volume, which we should get in a few days. 
If Europe falls today Bitcoin is fucked, but in a year or two who knows.

BTCC should allocate their hash power to Roger’s pool, claim all his money. And right before Roger has enough hash power to hijack Bitcoin, BTCC should leave Roger's pool. :D

@_date: 2016-12-12 10:10:38


On what do you base this assumption?
@_date: 2016-11-29 15:36:34
Pretty heavily probably, my node is currently consuming about 1200 to 1800 GB a month on upload bandwidth. So if we get Segregated Witness + a blocklimit increase I am definitely going to notice. xD
I currently have a 200 mbit down and 20mbit up cable connection which is more than anyone I know in Holland. But I am already sometimes reaching my maximum on upload speed.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:36:49
Can’t believe people downvote this. :P
@_date: 2016-12-11 19:52:06


The hardfork itself perhaps. But I think we will see a Core release with hardfork code much sooner, perhaps even 3 months from now.
If you want to do a hardfork properly you cant let it activate after 95% mining support during a 2016 block difficulty period. You will need a much broader support from the entire community. And therefore it will probably take maybe even 8 months for a hardfork to activate after 95% mining support has been reached, in contrary to the 2 weeks of Segregated Witness (2016 blocks).
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:27:40
Having moderation on a private internet forum is very common Roger. The internet is a free and open place. Everyone is free to make their own forum with their own rules that they think are best to keep that forum a pleasant place.
If you don’t agree with those rules you can create your own forum with your own rules, which you have done several times. That’s the beauty of the internet, it’s impossible to censor something.
But you can’t expect us to be dictated by you and follow the rules that you seem fit on our forum.
If we are having a private party and you are taking a shit in the corner, we will have to ask you to leave. Is that censorship? Or moderation? And do you have a valued opinion or are you just being an asshole?
If we wouldn’t have moderation on it would quickly turn into for example and our entire sub would be filled with trolls doing nothing other than taking a grab on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:18:47
I am also looking for something like that, preferably with Segwit support.
Samurai wallet seems to have it all, but their wallet is still in alpha…
Greenbits/greenaddress also has it, but their wallet doesn’t really work as nice. Especially because I am a bit spoiled with the awesome user interface of Mycelium (which is a great wallet but lacks Segwit).
@_date: 2017-08-29 19:32:12


You can only do that with Lightning, which is still being developed (but almost ready for use thanks to Segwit).
Blockchains are very slow and expensive, that’s just how they work.
Bitcoin is about financial freedom, not so much about convenience (at least not yet).
@_date: 2016-11-03 17:55:25
Damn, you are a pretty angry guy. :(
I just wanted to help the guy. If he wants to mine some Bitcoins let him mine some Bitcoins, who cares?
He won’t break even in 60 days of course but if he has a very low electricity price he can still earn some money.


No it isn’t.
The more small miners we have, the more decentralized the network is.
@_date: 2016-11-20 11:30:48


Not if we get both 2mb hardfork + Segregated witness.
We might even go to Mars. :)


Not sure if you can use those words combined. :)
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:17:23
Well lets stick to what we know. :)
Maybe they are simply moving, if thats the case their overall hashrate is not going to increase that much.
Or maybe they are not going to completely fill it up with Bitcoin miners. Perhaps they are preparing for the upcoming Lightning network and maybe they would like to create some Lightning hubs.
Or maybe some other Bitcoin related services. :P
Who knows what they could do with a nice toy farm like this. :)
Overall I think its great news if someone is prepared to invest so much money into Bitcoin.
I think I will buy another one. :)
@_date: 2016-11-20 14:09:47


Of course not.
First of all the miners are simply doing what they think is best for Bitcoin. You shouldn’t always assume everyone has some sort of evil agenda.
And secondly it’s not just miners, a lot of people in the industry would also prefer a small blocklimit increase: 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:29:35
Be careful tough, Bitcoin can be very addictive once you start to get involved. :D
Every day is exiting.
Also watch out for high volatility, sometimes Bitcoin can crash very hard and if you aren’t prepared you might panic sell and miss out on future profits. :)
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:23:31


That’s correct, but you can use CPFP to increase the fee of your transaction after you broadcasted your transaction.
@_date: 2018-10-29 19:29:35
In that case, if you don't have a computer or a smartphone, an online wallet like [blockchain.info]( is probably your best option indeed. :P
But its a rather risky way to use Bitcoin, especially if you are using random computers. Are you not worried someone might see your password at some point? Or a keylogger might steal it?
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:49:54

Do you have some prove? Or are you just spreading very dumb FUD.

You will be able to do that, but you will have to do it off-chain with solutions like Lightning.
Its simply impossible to do all those transactions on-chain. And even if it was possible it would mean we would turn Bitcoin into a horrible version of Paypal. Destroying everything that Bitcoin stands for.
To quote a small piece of the article:

Fees are currently 10 cents: 
So I think you are doing something wrong.
@_date: 2016-11-20 13:30:44
If you plan a hardfork properly, make sure it has a super majority of support and unlike Ethereum don’t let it activate in only 1 week but instead let it activate after 8 months for example, there is nothing wrong with a hardfork.
Even Bitcoin will need to hardfork someday. As long as you do it properly there is nothing wrong with that.

I know it wasn’t an agreement with the whole Bitcoin Core team.


It doesn’t matter.
What matters is that it was a great compromise. And the concept of that agreement could get us out of the current situation.
Just because some miners acted inresponsibly doesn’t mean you need to be childish about it as well.
At the moment we are going nowhere without a compromise.
Are some of you currently in contact with Jihan Wu? If not it might be a great idea to just send him a message to ask whats up.
He plays a huge role in the mining industry. If you would like to find out what miners are thinking I would start with him.
@_date: 2016-11-06 13:50:03
Well he only needs 75% of the blocks to let BU take over and ViaBTC is also at his side. So I would think 50% of the blocks is probably enough during a period of 2 weeks. So it would cost him about half a million a day.


Unless a government agency is helping him to destroy Bitcoin. If that’s the case he can keep it up for a pretty long time.

@_date: 2016-12-04 14:37:00
But I think the S9 is pretty much the most extreme you are going to get right now.
You could use something older that is less efficient, but older machines will usually also give you less hashes. Which means you are also going to mine less Bitcoins.
But someone else already gave you a link to the calculator on BitcoinWisdom, so you can do the calculations yourself to see what machine fits your needs. :)
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:16:28
Fees of-course, miners are only rewarded with new coins because Bitcoin didn’t have any users at the beginning and we needed a way to distribute the coins fairly.
Over time fees will take over. And the block reward will get less and less.
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:19:49
Highly unlikely. It takes a lot of time to fill this beasty and its not in their interest to get too big.

@_date: 2016-11-03 18:10:38


I am sorry I sort of skipped that part. I thought it was obvious you can’t break even after 60 days.
I just wanted to give the guy a little bit of help.
Btw, when you consider an electricity price of 5 cents and a difficulty increase of 7% a month it will take about 10 months to break even.
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:59:41
Agreement with who?
They can simply release it, just like they released Segregated Witness and we will see how much support it gets.
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:03:07


I doubt they are against Segregated Witness, because that wouldnt make sense.
But blocking Segregated Witness is the only leverage they have. They want to have stability so thats why they keep supporting Core even if they dont fully agree with the Core blocklimit policy. But by blocking Segregated Witness they hope they can confince the Core developers to implement a small blocklimit increase so this whole scaling debate can be put to an end.
@_date: 2017-08-27 14:38:19


You need a wallet that has already implemented Segwit, personally I used my Ledger Nano S. Other wallets will probably soon support Segwit as well.


Segwit transactions are much cheaper.

If you looked at the fees yesterday, they were almost all way under the recommended fee of 12 cents that was recommended for at least the past week (70 satoshis/byte). 
So I have to agree with that it looks highly suspicious.
But in the end it doesn’t matter whether it was a spam attack or not. It’s pointless to debate such a thing because it’s almost impossible to prove whether it was or was not.
What matters is that we need to find a solution to this problem.

Why are you so heavily against a small blocklimit increase?
You have said it yourself that 2mb, 4 or 8mb blocks aren’t going to hurt Bitcoin…
A split in the network would be ultimate chaos and the last thing we should want. This isn’t Ethereum where there are barely any actual users.
Bitcoin is huge and splitting the network would effect a lot of people that aren’t even involved in this everlasting stupid scaling debate.
@_date: 2016-11-15 22:59:29


That is true as well.
A normal user is not going to wait several days before he can use his wallet.
And a normal user is not prepared to sacrifice most of his connection to support the Bitcoin network.
@_date: 2016-11-15 12:09:39
Well assuming Segregated Witness gets activated, a hardfork to increase the blocklimit will eventually be necessary. First of all, when Segregated Witness is activated, Lightning isn’t far away. And to let Lightning transactions settle on-chain, a slightly larger blocklimit is necessary.
And to quote Peter Todd:  “only witness (signature) data can take advantage of this blocksize increase; non-witness data is still limited to 1MB total per block.”


I am just curioius if any progress has been made.
@_date: 2016-12-11 11:28:23
I think Antpool and F2Pool are waiting for a blocklimit increase in the form of a hardfork from Core.
Since Core developers where planning to do this anyway I think Segregated Witness will probably get activated as soon as Core releases a hardfork in one of the upcoming releases.
Just have some patience. :)
Personally I expect it to take at least a few more months.

Luke would like a blocksize decrease but he doesn’t have a problem with a blocklimit increase (as long as it’s done properly) for as far as I know.
You need to realize that blocksize and blocklimit are two different things.


It is not, even before the Hong Kong agreement Core developers have been working on a blocklimit increase.

@_date: 2016-11-03 06:27:17

For as far as I know thats only hardware.
But its in the own interest of a miner to not get too big. So Core doesnt have to do anything.
If Bitmain sees other parties investing a lot of money to grow bigger. The only thing they can do is the same thing. They dont want to be left behind.
Bitcoin is going to see some huge growth this year, and they need to grow with it.

Speak for yourself. :)
Personally I would love a small blocklimit increase from Core that is well planned and only activates after a very long period of time with a super majority of mining and user support.
If you plan a hard fork properly there is nothing wrong with it.
And Bitcoin could really use a small blocklimit increase at the moment. Because even if Core would implement it in the code today and you take into account a safe activation period it would take at least 8 month or perhaps even a year before a small blocklimit increase would activate.
So you can’t delay a hard fork until the last moment if you want to do it properly.
@_date: 2016-12-11 18:36:32


How can you be so sure?
@_date: 2016-11-17 09:36:50


Seems like a small blocklimit increase would be our best bet to stop BU.
Something Core has been working on anyway: 
@_date: 2017-01-21 14:01:47
It’s a combination of everything, both storage and [bandwidth]( but also RAM and CPU power.
Some people argue that normal people shouldn’t be running nodes anyway and that we should leave that to companies in huge datacenters. But that would make Bitcoin very centralized in my opinion. And it will also be very easy to shutdown Bitcoin that way by a government agency. So personally I am not a big fan of running every node in a datacenter.

Bitcoin is designed in a way that if a majority of the network forks, the other part will die off.
The only way for the original chain to survive would be to fork as well to adjust the mining difficulty. Therefore the original chain will be a forked one too.
So there won’t be an original chain when BU forks.
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:14:42
For what’s it worth, I wanted to let you know I fully agree with you. :)
Sadly you didn’t get many replies. :P
Although I must say unlike you described in your post I think it’s a good thing to have segregated witnesss as soon as possible. You never know when mass adoption starts so I think we should focus on things like lightning as soon as possible. And segregated witness is really going to help with that.
But I also fully agree with you that a small blocklimit increase would be more than welcome for political, economic and technical reasons.
Like you described I don’t think increasing the blocklimit is the ultimate solution. But since we will have to increase it anyway, to make it possible for lightning transactions to settle on the network. We might as well do it today, to overcome the political debate, to prevent long delays for confirmations and to enable more users to join.
It bothers me that the debate has become very black&amp;white. You are either at the small block side. And you don’t want any blocklimit increase at all. Or you are with the big blockers and you are doomed to constant Blockstream conspiracy theories and people that think 100mb blocks will be fine.
Sadly I am a bit in between the two sides. :P
Personally I think a 4mb blocklimit + segregated witness would be perfect. But I am afraid that’s not going to happen. :(
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:47:38


Because there are barely any lightweight wallets for Ethereum.


You can’t trust companies to run Bitcoin nodes. If the government would ever want to shutdown Bitcoin they can just make it illegal and all of those companies would have to shutdown their nodes.


Are you currently running  a full node?
I am and my node is currently consuming about 1200 to 1800gb a month, so bandwidth is an important factor.
@_date: 2016-11-18 20:06:34
You don’t have to reason with random people on Reddit.
For as far we know people on might enjoy this whole scaling debate. Perhaps they just try to make it worse than it is to try to split the community so their altcoin investment will rise.
The only thing that matters is Bitcoin wallets, exchanges, Bitcoin companies and the miners.
On Reddit you will always find people that disagree with you.

Well I cant say their network is very healthy at the moment....

@_date: 2016-11-29 13:16:43
Ethereum is different because they adjust the difficulty every 10 seconds, where Bitcoin adjusts the difficulty every 2016 blocks roughly every 2 weeks.
Therefore Bitcoin is much better protected against minority hardforks than Ethereum.
Ethereum Classic for example, where a small group of people without any technical knowledge where able to survive with a very tiny amount of hashrate can only be done on Ehtereum. If you would want to survive with a tiny amount of hashrate on Bitcoin you would have to modify the code and alter the difficulty manually and therefore create a fork.
Therefore Ethereum Classic cannot happen to Bitcoin.

I am happy I life in Holland where we still have some democracy. :)
I don’t understand the American system where you effectively only have 2 options, which is not really democracy in my opinion.
I also think it’s a bit strange their can only be 1 winner…
When there is only 1 winner, there is a huge part of the voters that is not represented in government.
But if I was a American citizen I would personally never vote for Trump. Mostly for 1 big reason and that’s his climate policy or actually the lack of it.
It baffles me that there are still people that don’t believe in climate change and that humans are the cause of it. :P

We will have to raise the blocklimit with a hardfork eventually, even the Core developers want to raise the blocklimit. The only thing that is being debated is when we do so.
And there is nothing wrong with that.
If you plan a hardfork properly make sure it has a majority support (95%) of miners, wallets, companies, exchanges, users, darknetmarkets basically everyone. Make sure it can’t activate earlier than 8 months and we use the code LukeJr made there are basically no risks.

I know and I fully support Segregated Witness, but as Peter Todd described non-witness data is still limited to 1MB which has its impact.

Why don’t you do some research into the ETC fork and Bitcoin?
Because if you would have done that you would have realized that what happened to Ethereum cannot happen to Bitcoin.
Because of the time between difficulty adjustments (Bitcoin 2 weeks) (Ethereum 15 seconds) a minority chain like Ethereum Classic cannot survive on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Bitcoin is much better protected than Ethereum.
If you want a minority chain to survive on Bitcoin, the minority chain would have to hard fork themself to survive and therefore kill itself in the process.
And the guys behind Ethereum Classic didn’t even had the knowledge to code a hard fork.

Segregated Witness doesn’t offer a blocklimit increase to non-witness data: 
It will also take at least a year before we can see any effect of Segregated Witness and it will only increase transaction capacity by a factor of 1,7
A lot of miners have stated years ago that they preferred a blocklimit of 8mb. BW Pool is even still voting for that: 
So that’s why they would like to see Segregated Witness + a 2mb hardfork.
In their opinion Segregated Witness simply takes too long to have any effect and they don’t believe it’s enough in the shortterm.

@_date: 2016-11-29 15:46:51


Me too. :P
But I still think we should go for it, in my opinion it seems the best way to go forward and the only way to get the community united.
And I still have some options, I currently have the amount of connections I accept set to the default value of 125. I could reduce that a little bit to safe bandwidth.
There is also 1 more step available in my subscription which should give me 300 mbit down and 30 mbit up.
So personally I could coop with Segregated Witness + 2mb.
But not sure about the rest of the network, we would have to look into that. But it’s very difficult to figure out what anonymous nodes can take.

Another reason why increasing the blocklimit is pointless.
Spamming the blockchain is way too easy, especially when you are a miner. Miners actually earn money when they spam the blockhain.
Decentralized second layer technologies on top of Bitcoin are the only way to go.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:12:16
Just wait and relax.
Either their DA is going to trigger and it will no longer be profitable to mine BCash which will result in a normal block time for Bitcoin. Or their hardfork in 15 hours is going to fix it and each chain will get the amount of hashrate relative to the price and the block time for Bitcoin will be sufficient.
This pump is a very simple and stupid attack, the only thing it does is helping us to get rid of people like Roger Ver.

An exchange publishing sensitive customer data seems very unlikely. ;)
There is no way they could do that, just like Coinbase isn’t going to publicly tell everyone who is buying Bitcoins from them.


You remind me a bit of this guy: 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:23:05


It’s not 48 hours, but 2 weeks.
Your transaction can’t confirm because of the input below. That one needs to confirm first, but it can’t (at least very unlikely) because your fee is only 1 sat/B (2 cents).
Your funds will return to your wallet 2 weeks after the latest transaction that tries to spent this input (which is 2 weeks after November the 23th).


Your only change is to get lucky that the 1 sat/B transaction doesn’t confirm, but in general there is no way to cancel a standard Bitcoin transaction. Your only change was if it was a RBF transaction, but sadly for you it isn’t.

Creating new money = inflation
Bitcoin has an inflation rate of 12.5 BTC every 10 minutes, BCash had a higher inflation rate because miners where abusing the EDA.
If you don’t want to call it inflation then suit yourself, but you can’t deny that BCash is about 10.000 blocks ahead of Bitcoin because their blocktime has been much faster several times.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:06:25
Well Bitcoin only has a DA (which is currently the same as BCash). But BCash also has an EDA (emergency difficulty adjustment). They have designed the EDA in a way that miners can manipulate the difficulty when they want too. So far this has created massive inflation, which is why they are going to hardfork in about 15 hours to change the DA and remove the EDA. The new DA algorithm will make sure it’s always profitable for miners to mine BCash.

@_date: 2017-11-12 14:01:35
I think that’s their plan, but it will be very hard to still accomplish that in the limited time they have left.
So it’s very likely that in a few hours their difficulty will make a huge jump and it will no longer be profitable to mine BCash. After that two things can happen, they can either stop mining BCash at all and wait 12 hours for the EDA to correct things. Or wait for the hard fork they have planned (which should be around the same time as the earliest possible EDA).

Can you imagine what Segregated Witness might do for Bitcoin when it finally activates?
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:54:40
In my opinion that graph is a bit pointless.
Bitcoin dominance has always been something like 0.00000001% compared to the total market (like stocks and gold for example). Comparing Bitcoin to random projects, for example private blockchains like Ripple is extremely pointless.
Those projects might be bigger than Bitcoin one day because they focus on private companies, which might initially be a bigger market.
But that has no effect on Bitcoin at all. People like me that actually use Bitcoin and are in it for the revolution, ideals and certain values will never use Ripple or Ether just because it has a bigger marketcap.
If (lets pick something random) Tesla has a bigger market valuation than Bitcoin, then Tesla will just be worth more than Bitcoin. But that doesn’t have any effect on Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin.
You should also take into account that those Altcoins are in a bit of a bubble.
1. They are not being used for anything.
2. All of them are mostly traded in BTC adding extra liquidity and value to Bitcoin (you can compare altcoin trading to online gambling, which is very positive for Bitcoin).
3. Pretty much all of them are 100% traded on Poloniex, which is a single point of failure (if Polo goes down, brace yourself for one big shit storm.)

Because Jihan Wu (Bitmain) is not stupid, he knows that we need the biggest players to let a UASF be successful.
That’s why he is creating his own exchanges and starts to attack Bitfinex (Bitfinex supports segwit).

I am not really sure why it wasn’t blocked earlier, you would have to ask some developers.
But I do know that it never really was a priority because nobody expected it to be used. And even if it was being used people didn’t see it as such a big problem. After all, miners being a little bit more efficient is not really a big deal.
What is new tough (which was discovered last week) is that AsicBoost is incompatible with pretty much every softfork. So it turned out that Bitmain wasn’t blocking Segwit because they wanted bigger blocks, but because they wanted to be able to keep using AsicBoost.
So although AsicBoost isn’t ideal because it gives an unfair advantage to only 1 miner, that in itself isn’t the biggest problem. The problem is that the usage of AsicBoost makes upgrading the network very difficult because the miner that has that advantage doesn’t want to lose it.
It also starts to look like Bitmain iniated this whole controversy only because they wanted to keep their 100 million dollar advantage every year. Not because they really wanted to run BU.

I have never been dismissive of alts, some of them are doing really cool things and in the past 2 years I have made insane profits of some of them. I just think this “Bitcoin dominance” graph is a bit random and pointless.
In my opinion it doesn’t really matter if one of those projects or a combination of several projects acquires a larger marketcap than Bitcoin. Bitcoin will always be Bitcoin.
Alts are like stocks to me, a nice way to earn some extra Bitcoin if you know what you’re doing. But the majority of my money will always be in Bitcoin.
Besides, the crypto industry has such a huge amount of potential, there is plenty of space for multiple coins.
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:33:53
Well it’s an easy promise to make, because with Segwit+Schnorr and the 2.5 minute blocktime of the Litecoin blockchain they will have 10 times more capacity than Bitcoin. Something they are never going to need (currently litecoin blocks hold like 10 transactions on avarage)
So Litecoin will never ever need to increase the blocklimit.

BWPool is in the same spot as GBMiners, they are just being pressured by Bitmain. Bitmain does not only produce most of the Bitcoin miners, they also produce pretty much all of the scrypt miners for Litecoin so they can force some pools to do what they tell them to do.

@_date: 2017-04-09 11:45:18
I don’t think you really understand what I am saying…

If we increase the blocklimit any further it will be impossible to run a node behind TOR.
And if we go with his plan and switch to emergent consensus (BU) and fully scale on-chain (which is impossible, but let’s assume it isn’t) we will indeed be left with only a few full nodes.
At that stage the government can simply ban Bitcoin. There will be no nodes running behind TOR, so it will be very easy to discover who is running those 12 nodes by just looking at the IP address.
Having centralized mining isn’t ideal and with bigger blocks the mining centralization will become even worse leading to more and more governance issues. But all of that is sort of manageable, because miners can’t change anything as long as the community doesn’t support it. But when we only have 12 nodes there no longer is a community.
If I can no longer run my own node I will stop using Bitcoin.

Litecoin is much more interesting because it at least has a little bit of marketcap compared to coins like Clams for example that already activated Segwit a few months ago.
But the most important reason is Jihan Wu and Jiang Zhou’er (Antpool, btc.top, ltc.top and LTC1BTC) are also very large miners on Litecoin. So if Litecoin gets Segwit those guys will (sort of) be forced to upgrade their Litecoin pool to Segregated Witness.
Which will be very interesting for Bitcoin from a political point of view.
Other coins that activate Segwit are also interesting but much less, because they still have GPU mining.

Well my advice would actually be to sell…
Holding Ripple is not diversifying that’s just gambling.
Diversifying sure, but don’t buy things like Ripple, Dash, PascalCoin and so on.
Diversify into another industry like gold for example because that’s actually something different.
And if you really want some altcoins buy the once that are actually being used, Monero for example.

4MB + Segwit would give us 8MB, I think that might be a bit extreme, there is currently no blockchain that handles such large blocks.
But I fully agree with you that 2MB + the doubling that Segwit gives, would be a nice solution. Personally I would support it.

Roger will also arrogantly claim **he** is the one representing “Satoshi’s vision”. Which is:
1. Complete bullshit, it’s rather difficult to exactly determine what Satoshi would have wanted, because he is simply no longer among us. And pretty much every quote of Satoshi can be interpreted in many ways, but [in 2010 Satoshi specifically said](  we shouldn’t increase the block limit and if we ever needed to so it could be phased in, which is the complete opposite of BU that wants to fork at a random moment and letting the limit be decided by the miners. The only ones that are currently still following Satoshi’s vision are the original Bitcoin developers who want to be careful when they implement a hardfork. But most importantly we still don’t need a hardfork to increase the block limit because we can still increase on-chain capacity without raising the blocklimit.
2. It kind of kills the debate when you are coming up with arguments like the vision of a man that is no longer here. You simply don’t know what that man would have wanted and you are avoiding talking about the subject itself and actually debating the technical side.
And of-course he will bring up the moderation of which is way too strict according to him…
Personally I think it is way too soft, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
But again coming up with simple minded arguments like reddit, muh coffee and Satoshi's vision is a great way to avoid any technical debate. :P

How would you feel if you just got a speeding ticket for driving too fast?
If you break the rules you will have to face the consequences.
Not that it matters that much on the internet, you can create a new account in a second. But most importantly if you don’t like the moderation on 1 forum you can join a million other forums or create your own forum…
The internet is completely free, you better learn to live with that freedom.
If this was my forum I would permaban every troll that comes here and tries to divide or destroy our community, no mercy whatsoever.
Bitcoin is very vulnerable to social engineering and Sybil attacks because that’s pretty much the only way to attack Bitcoin. So any true Bitcoiner should fight those trolls in every possible way.

Whenever Bitcoin has a bull run, we as the crypto-currency industry attract a lot of fresh capital (usually called dumb money). And as long as the Bitcoin bull run is ongoing altcoins kind of take a hit and have trouble rising because they are all traded and priced in Bitcoins.
But when the bull run slows down and Bitcoin finally starts to stabilize again. This new capital (dumb money) starts to think: “well maybe I should also buy some of them altcoins, diversify my investment so to say”. This is a very natural thing for people to think (pretty much all people think that way). And usually this is a great strategy, but you should always do your research on something before you throw your money at it. Don’t just buy random things only because you want to diversify.
And that’s kind of the problem here, because these new people don’t really know the background on all of these projects (altcoins) and they simply don’t have the time to do all the research. And you can’t blame them because completely understanding all these projects is almost impossible. So it’s very hard for them to filter out the scams from the interesting projects.
So what they start to do is just buy whatever project that they see is increasing in value. And some people that have been playing this game for years take advantage of that. And organize a little thing called a “Pump&amp;Dump”
These Pump&amp;Dump tactics are the most effective when you have a lot of dumb money, very little coins that are actually on the exchange and very little initial trade volume of the asset at the start of the pump.
And that’s what you are currently witnessing, Ripple is pretty much a dead project. Nobody was really trading it anymore so the volume was very low and very few Ripple holders where actually storing their coins on Poloniex so there is nobody to quickly sell them.
We also had a huge bull run on Bitcoin this year that started in October and only ended 2 months ago. Bitcoin even breached the ATH and broke the barrier of a troy ounce of gold, this was all over the news. So we attracted a huge amount of new fresh dumb money.
Senior scammers are taking advantage of this by pumping these altcoins and letting newbs trow their money at it. This way these scammers (or smart individuals depends on how you look at it), can make huge amounts of extra Bitcoins.
Currently it’s the perfect time for people to scam and get scammed.
Some of these new people will learn their lesson and learn to recognize a Pump&amp;Dump before they trow money at it, some people will get filthy rich and some people will start to hate the crypto industry and keep shitting on it for the rest of their life because they got burned.
I can only hope you sold on time. ;)

That’s not going to work for 4 reasons.

2. It’s too complicated for the majority of users to do something like that.
3. Most people don’t follow this stupid debate, so they don’t know what is going on.
4. Miners get most of their income from the 12.5 BTC block reward, so they really don’t care if their fees drop by 10% and they earn a 100 dollars less.

Exactly, as an end user you don't have to know the exact details. You just click on "Enqueue" and Wasabi Wallet takes care of everything else.

Too bad you guys hyped it a lot, but didn't bother to make it the default option and instead hide it in the settings that most users never check. :P
So this way it wont have a lot of impact.
@_date: 2018-11-01 18:36:18
Yes, that's a bit of a downside. You need to keep the app running (and therefore your computer) until there are enough participants to start a round. At the moment this will take a few hours, but this will get better once there are more people using Wasabi Wallet. In the future it might also be possible to add extra liquidity by creating compatibility with other wallets implementing Chaumian CoinJoin like Samourai Wallet, so the time between rounds can get shortened even further. But I am not 100% if this is realistically possible.
But you don't have to keep checking the wallet, everything is automated. Once you have clicked "Enqueue" and there are sufficient peers the transaction will automatically be created. So you don't have to keep checking the wallet. Although that might be fun the first time. :)

There simply is a financial gain in this scaling debate. People can talk shit about how Bitcoin will fail because it gets to popular and how it will die tomorrow. And in the meantime convince people to buy their shitcoin so they can become rich.
Reddit is just a horrible place for these discussions because of the voting system. Anyone’s opinion can be downvoted to oblivion in a way that nobody will see it anymore. You simply need to create a dozen accounts and you can have any post on top that reflects your opinion, something that is constantly happening on So in a way they got the same censorship (probably even worse).
You need to have strict moderation on reddit, especially if the financial gains are so big. Otherwise you end up like and the entire subreddit will be filled with people claiming Bitcoin is going to die.

Very true, but that’s why 2XCoin is so dangerous. Because it actually has a little bit of economical consensus (Coinbase for example) but not all of it.
It also doesn’t have all of the miners onboard, F2Pool and Slush for example. And Bitfury will jump back on the original chain if it survives.
So we will get 2 Bitcoins without knowing what the “real” Bitcoin is.

Wouldn't it be possible to add hardware wallet support to Wasabi without using the CJ option (as a temporary solution)? A user will then have the option to generate a new wallet "Normal Wasabi wallet with CJ" or "Hardware wallet without CJ". He or she can then (when 2 wallets have been generated) either switch to the normal wasabi wallet (with CJ) or the hardware wallet option all within the same Wasabi interface. When the user chooses the hardware wallet option they can't use CJ, but they can still benefit from Neutrino and Tor integration. :P
Because at the moment its rather difficult to use a hardware device with Tor and a full node (or Neutrino). Wasabi could make that a lot easier I think, without having to add a lot of new code.

Bitcoin enables me to be my own bank and escape the central banking system. Even though I rarely use Bitcoin to buy stuff (because that isn’t always an option), I use Bitcoin to buy fiat when I need something. So indirectly I use Bitcoin for everything I buy.

About 1500 dollars or something, but I don’t have time to calculate it right now. You will need to look at the current difficulty that miners are mining against.


Creating a cryptocurrency is like 2 hours work if you know what you’re doing, so that won’t cost you a lot. The difficult thing is to get people using it.


“better”, English is better than Dutch (which is my own langue). But still some people prefer to speak Dutch. That’s just the way it is.
One could argue Pepsi is better than Coke Cola, but still people drink Cola because its more well known. But some people also drink Pepsi.
There doesn’t have to be 1 winner. Bitcoin will decentralize everything, even itself.


It needs time, it’s already much more stable than it was 8 years ago. In 20 years it will probably be ready for the average working man to use it as a stable currency. Although Bitcoin is already rather stable compared to currencies like the Syrian lira for example.


Because I believe it will be better for the entire crypto movement if we have one very large stable cryptocurrency that everyone knows. If people choose to use many different currencies it will take much longer for us to get to our end goal (but we will achieve it nonetheless it will just take 50 years instead of 20). So I prefer to keep it strong. Plus I don’t support any of the more centralized cryptocurrencies.
But I do own some Monero and Litecoins.


Dollars and Euro’s are devided among the entire population and accepted as a method of payment everywhere. It will take decades before Bitcoin ever gets to that point, until then Bitcoin will be rather unstable.


Lol, apparently you have never heard of the forex market. People gamble on the Euro and the Dollar all the time.

They process a lot of transactions, so having them onboard on an attack on Bitcoin helps a lot to make such an attack successful. It would be best if didn’t had so much control over all those transactions.


I believe Bitcoin needs altcoins, so I disagree with you on that one.

Bitcoin halved in value 2 weeks ago, it does that all the time…

Gold has value because people buy it, it’s that simple.
Bitcoin has value because people like me buy it.


I don’t gamble, I am an idealist. I do it for political reasons. :P
I don’t care about the price.


When people deposit dollars into their bank account, they already have dollars. If people sell their dollars for Euro’s, the price of the Euro relative to the dollar will rise. So yes, currency does work that way.
Dollars and Euro’s are also a speculative investment that one day could disappear.

He assumed we would have a network where simple wallets (like the one on your phone) would be able to force the consensus rules like a full node does. This turned out to be practically impossible and was never build.
This is why we need people and companies to run full nodes to prevent malicious miners from changing the consensus rules (like the blocklimit, blocktime and the 21 million BTC cap).
That’s why we can’t scale on-chain because it would require us to increase the blocklimit so much that it would be impossible to run a full node and Bitcoin would be worthless.

For the decentralization of Bitcoin it’s still and always will be preferable if blocks stay as small as possible.

@_date: 2017-09-02 13:59:34
There isn’t really an optimal size, you just need to pick something that works. And go from there to scale Bitcoin to a global scale.
10KB is obviously to small and 16 MB is obviously too big. But whether you make the blocklimit 500KB or 2MB doesn’t really matter that much.
Satoshi picked 1MB and we will work from that point to further scale Bitcoin with second layer technologies.

Personally I wouldn’t be surprised if this attack is only made to cause as much disruption as possible. It’s probably not even their intention to let 2XCoin become a success.

It would be absurd if wallets wouldn’t be able to see incoming Segwit transactions…
Can you imagine if some people would be using Segwit and exchanges wouldn’t be able to see those transactions coming in? Would be chaos.
I have send transactions from my Ledger (configured to use Segwit) to Electrum multiple times and it works great.

@_date: 2017-10-03 19:50:41


Technically it’s never a Segwit transaction if you use Electrum in the process.
It’s only a Segwit transaction if you go from a segwit address to another segwit address.
But if you send to or from Electrum there is always a legacy address involved, therefore for Electrum nothing looks different.
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:34:28

That’s not correct, some miners still have the “NYA” text in the coinbase but aren’t actually supporting it (like F2Pool for example). So it’s much less than 94%.


Let’s say hypothetically that Core would add replay protection every single time some idiots claim they are going to hardfork Bitcoin. Then Core would create a hardfork themselves because they added the replay protection.
So the only thing you would have to do to let Bitcoin hardfork (and potentially destroy itself) is just to scream very load “oke guys we are going to hardfork Bitcoin”. And Core would have to write a replay protection every single time.
Pretty strange way of thinking from the 2XCoin idiots.

Reducing the time between blocks has several security risks, which other coins don’t really experience as much because they aren’t attacked as much as Bitcoin.
For example it would make it easier to fork Bitcoin when the blocktime is shorter.
Preferably you keep the blocktime as long as possible.

The log files of the FBI of which they don't want to tell us how they acquired them, showed that the DPR account tried to hire a hitman.

That’s not true, F2Pool has withdrawn from the NYA a little while ago but they still have the random tekst in the coinbase. So sites like coin.dance still count F2Pool as a supporter, while in fact he won’t be mining 2XCoin.
And Bitfury said they will jump back on the original chain if it survives. And since F2Pool will be mining the original chain it will survive. So in reality 2XCoin only has about 80% of the hashrate.
But in the end hashrate doesn’t matter, the only thing that matters is the market.

@_date: 2017-10-01 14:08:52
BCH was considered an altcoin by every single exchange, merchant and user. Plus it used replay protection, it barely had any hashrate and it used a different difficulty readjustment mechanism.
It was nothing more than an altcoin that used the transaction history of Bitcoin. Something that has happened multiple times in Bitcoin’s history.
But a fork where both sides try to be the real Bitcoin, without replay protection and where both sides have exchanges, wallets and users at their side. That is something new.

No one knows of-course, but these are my theories…
1. The dollar has been crashing very sharply lately, so far it has crashed 15%. But some say it might go back to pre-2015 levels. This would mean if you hodl dollars you will lose 50% of your wealth. So for people with American stocks or people that are simply hodling dollars, Bitcoin is suddenly looking very desirable.
2. Xapo, Gemini and others have all been dumping huge amounts of BCash for Bitcoin. Causing a shortage in Bitcoin which causes the price to rise.
3. People want to have more Bitcoins before the fork because they think they will get free money just like what happened in August.
4. A lot of people shorted Bitcoin the past few week, since Bitcoin is currently doing the exact opposite of what those people expected. They all had to buy back, causing another spike.

When posts about Ross show up on and you got into Bitcoin only recently, you might ask yourself how is this relevant to Bitcoin? Didn't he try to kill several people? And isn't Ross a drug-lord that build the Silk Road?
If you want to have an answer to all these questions and learn more about Bitcoin its probably best to watch the following documentary. 


The Silk Road put Bitcoin on the map, it was one of the first use-cases that showed the power of Bitcoin and how Bitcoin could enable a truly free market where people could exchange goods without violence.


The log files of the FBI of which they don't want to tell us how they acquired them, showed that the DPR account tried to hire a hitman.

He was politically motivated to make a difference, let people trade in peace and put an end to the war on drugs. Whether you agree with him or not, he shouldn't be in prison for the rest of his life for that.

I didn't actually knew Ross admitted that, I was referring to one of the first interviews the DPR gave where he explained he didn't actually start the Silk Road but his predecessor did. It also seems unlikely because Ross didn't actually had any programming skills. But he was definitely involved from the start.
Either way its not really important for the point I am trying to make, so I have removed it from my post and will do some further reading!

People need to realize that what happened to Ethereum **cannot** happen to Bitcoin. 
Because of the time between blocks and the difficulty adjustment that only adjusts itself every 2016 blocks a minority chain will **never** survive.
If people would keep on mining on a minority chain there will be almost no blocks at all and it might even take a whole year for the difficulty to adjust itself.
Ethereum is not as secure as bitcoin because they adjust the difficulty every second. So that’s why a minority chain was able to survive.
So unlike Ethereum, Bitcoin is already protected against minority chains in its core protocols.
If Bitcoin hardforks only the longest chain will survive.

Because the forked chain will lose value, miners will mine of that chain???
Wtf are you smoking dude. xD


If there is no incentive to mine on a minority chain, there will be no miners mining on that chain. Therefore there will be no blocks and no transactions.
So unless a Bitcoin on a minority has 10 times more value, a minority will chain will **not** survive.
@_date: 2016-10-30 09:55:09
I understand your point, but I think it might be best if you would be a bit more specific these days. Certain people (will probably interpreted you statement the wrong way.
If I am correct you would prefer smaller blocks to prevent low value transactions from polluting the blockchain. Because as it sits right now, guys like Roger Ver can perform huge spam attacks on the blockchain for political reasons.
If we would have a smaller ~~blocksize~~ block-limit, fees would be around 20 cents and we won’t have this problem.
But I assume you don’t actually want to reduce the ~~blocksize~~ block-limit because it would require a very controversial hardfork. Hardforks in general aren’t necessarily controversial but reducing the ~~blocksize~~ block-limit would be.
And since we will have to increase the ~~blocksize~~ block-limit at some point in time anyway we might as well keep it at 1mb for now. Altough it would have been better if it was a bit lower today. :)
So in a summary you don’t have a problem with increasing the ~~blocksize~~ block-limit in the future. But you don’t want to increase it today because it would make the already annoying spam attacks even easier.
Let me know if this sort of sums it up. :)

You just say how much Bitcoins you want, pay with your bank account (which takes like 3 seconds) and the Bitcoins are transferred to the Bitcoin address you provided.
Similar to how shapeshift works, but then with Euro’s instead of crypto.
@_date: 2016-10-16 10:46:03


First of all there was no technical know-how to do this at the Ethereum Classic team. But let’s assume there was…
Let’s assume the minority chain is the original chain just like what happened to Ethereum. If you are going to hardfork the original chain to change the difficulty manually then you have just destroyed the original chain and created an altcoin.
So you are actually admitting that a minority chain can’t survive in the Bitcoin protocol…


A block time of several hours is not really surviving…
And if you consider the price per Bitcoin will be lower on this minority chain, then there will not be any economic incentive to keep mining on this chain.
With Ethereum Classic the difficulty was almost instantly much lower so you could get large amounts of ETC with almost no computable power at all which created an incentive to mine. If there would be a minority chain after a hardfork on the Bitcoin network there will be no incentive, because miners would get the same amount of Bitcoin at a much lower price. So miners would have to mine out of charity.
@_date: 2016-10-16 17:08:51
When I was talking about a minority chain I meant, Classic, BitcoinXT or Bitcoin Unlimited. If they decide to hardfork at this stage they wont survive.


They also have a majority of the support.
@_date: 2016-10-16 12:47:30


You can’t know that for sure.
But even if that was the case then why would a miner mine on a chain if his reward is 10 times lower?


Doesn’t matter because it will take several adjustments to go back to a normal block time, not just 1.
@_date: 2016-10-16 12:28:03
Well at the moment the percentage is exactly the same.
But it’s pretty easy to create a node, so it’s not really a great representation.
I alone could create 10000 BitcoinXT nodes but that doesn’t mean anything.
@_date: 2016-10-16 13:20:03


What hard fork?
And who is we?


Who are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-10-30 19:44:44


What we saw last week was someone creating tens of thousands of transactions with a 3 cent fee while the average fee has been 8 cents for at least a year.
That’s called spamming the network.


Its technically impossible to let Bitcoin scale on-chain. If you want the whole world to use Bitcoin you will need smarter solutions than simply increasing the blocklimit.


After the all the hacks and hardforks I don’t understand why people still believe in such a shitcoin.
Look what happened to their network after the ZCash launch: 
Wouldn’t want to call that stable. xD

@_date: 2016-10-31 09:57:50
It doesn’t matter, there is still Roger's pool that’s mining BU and some smaller guys mining Classic.
Core is currently at 90%: 
If we want Segregated Witness to activate, ViaBTC will either need to completely disappear or start mining Core.
Or we will need to lower the percentage from 95% to 90% or perhaps even 85%.

@_date: 2017-05-14 17:31:01

The blockchain was empty back then, so anything was possible. But buying a pizza with an on-chain transaction is like going to the mall with a tank.


You can pay for your groceries with Bitcoin (the currency), but you shouldn’t buy your groceries over the Bitcoin blockchain. Ideally you should use a lightning like solution for those smaller less important transactions.
@_date: 2016-10-30 17:14:05


Well not on-chain of-course, but with lightning low value transactions shouldnt be a problem.


True. :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:47:13
If you want something very simple (newb friendly) for the short term for small amounts that’s reasonable secure, I would recommend Mycelium. (Mycelium is already a huge improvement over blochchain.info)
If you want something really secure you should buy yourself a hardware wallet like a Trezor or a Ledger. You can combine those with Mycelium to get both a user friendly environment and optimal security.
If you want something that’s free and just as secure as a hardware wallet, but a little bit more difficult to use I would recommend a paper wallet. But remember that you need to know what you’re doing when you use a paper wallet. It’s not super difficult, but if you screw up you can lose all your coins.

Yes, after a few days your bitcoins will be returned to your wallet.
You should take a look at the sticky on this subreddit.

You could also use Mycelium instead of Blockchain.info, mycelium is much better at calculating the fee correctly.

@_date: 2017-05-21 07:34:47
You paid a [fee of 100.311 sat/B]( resulting in a total fee of $0.76 (transaction is 373 bytes). Current minimum recommended fee is about 150 satoshis/byte: 
Or 330 satoshis/byte if you want a fast transaction.
Your transaction might confirm in a few days but it seems unlikely in my opinion. You could try to use CPFP to get your transaction to confirm a bit quicker. Or you could wait until your transaction is returned to your wallet.
Next time you should really use:

@_date: 2017-05-21 15:06:16
1. If it took 3 hours, your fee wasn’t high, either you pay a high fee and get a fast confirmation or you wait. Bitcoin is either fast and expensive or cheap and slow, you can’t have both.
2. Bitcoin was never meant to buy your groceries at the supermarket. Even with empty blocks it can take up to 2 hours to get a confirmation because of the random block interval.
3. Bitcoin is a peer2peer cash system, not a payment network. The payment network that is currently being built in various ways will do what you want it to do (instant and free transactions) but the currency itself will always be slow.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:54:06
One of the admins (DeSnake) was caught because his wife worked with the police for 6 months.
Bitcoin is pseudonymous, which is good enough if you know what you are doing (and Alphabay defintly knew what they were doing).

Electrum is not the best at calculating the fee correctly. If you use Electrum you need to do it manually and use the following website to see what fee you should use.
Currently 180 satoshis/byte should be sufficient.


If you do nothing the funds will either be returned to your wallet or the transaction will confirm.

I have been hodling since 2014 and it seems the cycle just keeps repeating itself. :P
Only this time its extra stupid…
Segregated Witness is about to activate, we are processing more than 200.000 transactions every day, Bitcoin is around 2000 dollars, it has had an insane increase over the past 12 months, Alphabay is finally gone and multisig markets like Hansa and DHL are finally gaining traction, Tumblebit is coming, RSK is doing awesome things, Liquid, Lightning and the list just keeps going on.
And somehow Bitcoin is dead again?
I can sort of understand the FUD, but personally I wouldn’t worry that much about a chain split, the consensus algorithm and the long blocktime will make sure Bitcoin will be fine.

What kind of evil plan is Jihan planning?
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:17:26
In the short term I agree with you that it’s a bad thing that Alphabay is gone. But in the long term it clears the path for multisig markets like Hansa and DHL so people won’t lose their money anymore when a market disappears.
And in the absence of Alphabay decentralized markets like OpenBazaar 2.0 might even take off. Making sure we will never have to deal with disappearing markets ever again.


I will take that as a compliment. :)
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:06:48
If you want to compete with the dollar and the Euro you simply cannot do that onchain. It’s just mathematically and technically impossible. Roger can complain all he wants about censorship but fully depending on simply increasing the blocklimit to oblivion is just not an option.

Most people will do that, including me. That’s why the 2x in Segwit2x will never succeed. Personally I think the NYA was only made to trick people like Jihan into activating Segregating Witness. Once Segwit is activated everyone will probably stop running btc1 and forget about it.
Jihan might try to fork off in September with BitcoinABC when he realizes nobody is running btc1 anymore, but without community support he will just be on his own little chain, which will be nothing more than a centralized altcoin.

The whole point of a blockchain was to build a decentralized trustless system. If you are going to build a cryptocurrency backed by gold you will have to trust a centralized middle man to give you gold for your coins. Removing the whole “decentralization and trustless system” from the equation.
To me these centralized government coins and corporate coins sound a bit ridiculous…
You could compare it to this: 
They already have what they are trying to build and it’s called fiat, they are just trying to put a fancy blockchain sticker on it.
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:04:46
1. Your data is wrong, your percentages don’t match reality. You should look at a longer block period (2 weeks for example)
2. There is no proof Jihan controls all of those pools.
3. 1 person controlling a lot of hashrate is not such a big treat as it used to be. The community is much more distributed these days (wallets, merchants, darknetmarkets, etcetera), just because 1 person controls a lot of hashrate doesn’t mean he or she can fork Bitcoin. If someone breaks any of the consensus rules the community will reject his or her blocks and Jihan will be on his own chain.

They used to have about 11% of the total hashrate, but recently this has dropped to about 4%. And it seems they have not only stopped adding new hashpower to the network, which caused their relative share to the network to drop. But now it seems that they have also removed some of their mining capacity causing it to drop from 380 PH to about 260 PH.

@_date: 2016-07-13 20:37:09
You are right, but I never insinuated bitcoin would die if fees would rise. :)
I just think Bitcoin can grow much larger if fees stay low until we have lighting. ;)
For example let’s say hypothetically Bitcoin is being used by only 1 group of people. For example those guys on the darknet. Right now that group is not that big, fees are only 10 cents and everything is fine. :)
But now imagine a situation where the darknet becomes really popular and that specific group of people starts to grow. Now they will have to compete to get their transactions in the blockchain and eventually some customers will get kicked out. At some point they would start to use some shitcoin.
So in this hypothetical situation Bitcoin would no longer be used and it would lose a large part of its value.
I know this scenario can’t come true because Bitcoin has an unlimited amount of usecases not only one.
But my fear is that the people that might cause the fees to rise will be the same people that will get kicked of the chain. And if we lose the largest group of users, it will have an effect on the price.

He played a brilliant political game that caused Segregated Witness to activate on Litecoin. This proved to the world that Segregated Witness is a safe upgrade. It was the first step to make sure Segregated Witness would activate on Bitcoin.
Don’t underestimate people like Wang Chun.

I agree with you. :)
Core gets way to much undeserved negativity.
But what do you expect when you combine the internet with a 10 billion dollar market, huge potential, intense competition and loads of people that all want to share their opinion about everything. :D
When you then start to deal with a situation like the scaling debate where people have different opinions about a solution, you will get very heavy opinions. :)
Eventually some people will take advantage of this to pump their shitcoin and will try to split the community by saying Core is pure evil.
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:29:22
I doubt that when people have found an alternative they will return to Bitcoin once fees have returned to normal.
I think it’s best to just avoid a situation where people would even consider shitcoins.
Not long ago [the last darknet market that accepted shitcoins](
 disappeared and I like it that way. ;)
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:08:39
But if fees would ever rise to a point where those guys would have to pay more on fees then on their drugs. Then they will definitely start to use some shitcoin.
I am sure those guys would rather just stick to Bitcoin because it keeps things simple. If you have several different shitcoins on the darknet then it is like Europe without the Euro but worse.
So I am sure they will use Bitcoin for as long as possible. But if you pay a mining fee of 10 euro’s and you order a small amount of drugs for 9 euro’s. Then it just stops making sense to use Bitcoin.

It's actually about 0,6% to 1% a year and you only pay taxes when you have over €30K (€60K if you have a partner), everything below that amount is tax free.
The Netherlands is pretty awesome when it comes to Bitcoin (and investments in general).

Damn this guy is stupid. XD
Also nice to see how he censored all the comments at the bottom of his article that try to correct his article. :D
You can still see them if you sort at newest, but they are hidden in standard view.
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:35:23
I think the guys at will disagree with you. ;)
They don’t see Bitcoin as "digital gold" they use Bitcoin every day and depend on it.
At the moment fees are still affordable, but it would be very sad if those guys would stop using Bitcoin in the future because fees have risen to several dollars.
Lighting is great, but at the moment we don’t have it yet. So if we would ever reach a point in the future where fees are getting so high that we would start to lose the actual users because lightning isn’t operational yet. I think it’s best to raise it a little bit, just to fill the cap until we have lighting.
If I am correct compact blocks should make it possible to safely raise it a little bit.

That’s correct, just use it the same way as you would use your dollars or euro’s.
After a few years you will get used to the price swings and learn to ignore them, just like you aren’t constantly watching the euro or dollar chart.

Rootstock (RSK) is a Bitcoin sidechain. On RSK it is possible to run Ethereum smart contracts while still using the currency Bitcoin. This way you can have the stability of the Bitcoin network (long blocktime, very hard to change) and at the same time get all the advantages of Ethereum.
RSK kind of makes Ethereum obsolete.
Another advantage of RSK is that it helps Bitcoin to scale with Lumino.

Electrum is not as safe as a harware wallet, but its definitly one of the best wallets. For larger amounts and long term storage I would choose a hardware wallet, but for smaller amounts its fine.

@_date: 2016-07-13 18:56:29
I agree with you.
But I don’t think 2 or 4 mb is going to destroy the decentralization of Bitcoin. Especially not now we have compact blocks.
And raising the blocksize a little bit is inevitable in the long term. Even lighting will need slightly bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:32:33
I have been dumping my Ether stash for the past weeks and will continue to do so in the upcoming weeks. But that’s mostly because Rootstock is coming and because Ethereum is incredibly overvalued.
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:50:21
Yea those 10 euro's where just an example. xD
It’s probably a bit more than that. :D
But I think you understand my point. :)
I also think off-chain solutions will be ready by then, so we will probably be just fine. But just in case we ever see a huge spike in users for a long period of time in the coming year. I think we should be open minded towards slightly bigger blocks. Just to fill the cap until lightning is ready.
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:40:07
I fully agree with you. Raising the block size is an imperfect solution to scale to a global level.
But I don’t want the blocksize to be increased to such an extent. I only want the blocksize to be increased a little bit to keep transactions costs cheap in the short term. And in the long term we need bigger blocks so we can have more lighting transactions.
But I believe Bitcoin is probably going to be fine whatever path we may choose. :)
And if Core wants to keep the blocks small for now I fully support them. ;)

If you don't like the content, you should try to improve it yourself instead of criticizing the posts of others.
What have you contributed yourself so far?

You can only change Bitcoin if you control everything which is, miners, nodes and users. Something one person can never achieve.
But nodes are the least powerful, they are like slaves of the network so spoofing them on VM is rather pointless.
@_date: 2017-06-05 19:15:32
Great article.
Very interesting thought, hadn’t looked at it that way before. :)
But as has already pointed out, there are of-course other reasons why people prefer Bitcoin over altcoins.

I know the miner fee is the least of their costs at the moment. But I would just like it to stay that way.
Things will probably be just fine, otherwise I wouldn’t be a Bitcoin holder. :D
But I think we should be a little bit more open minder about small blocksize increases just in case fees ever start to rise out of control.
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:23:27

Well you are sort of correct, but what about the people that are using Bitcoin?
At the moment there is no real problem, but what if we would ever reach a point where Lighting isn’t finished yet and fees become too high for the actual users to pay?
If someone is ordering drugs on the darknet and they are paying someone 25 euro’s but they need to pay a fee of 5 euro’s to the Bitcoin network. What stops them of using something else that is much cheaper?
I know ordering drugs online might be controversial, but those guys are one of the earliest adopters. And people that use Bitcoin everyday even if their usage is a bit controversial helps to stabilize the price. So in my opinion they have a positive effect on the adoption and the price of Bitcoin. So wouldn’t it be sad if we lost those guys?

Bitcoin has an **average** block time of 10 minutes, so sometimes it might take 30 seconds for a block to be generated and sometimes it might take 2 hours.

These guys are "turning into" Ethereum pumpers. Probably not wise to trust them.
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:59:43
Well those two limits are very different for 2 reasons.
First there is nobody that wants to raise the 21 million cap. :D
And second Bitcoin users will never be affected by the 21 million cap in a negative way.
So you can’t really compare those two. ;)
But I understand your point that we have to be careful when we do this. We don’t want to end up like Ethereum where we destroy all our principles in a hardfork. :D 
That’s why it’s a good thing that we have been debating about this for such a "long time". :)

Great article. :)
But although I am a Core supporter I still think it would be awesome if we had slightly bigger blocks, maybe 4 or 8 mb.
And I don’t think they were aware of compact blocks when they wrote the article. If I am correct this should help with the latency problem to reduce orphan blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-24 08:38:37
They have about 5% of the hashrate so this would give Segregated Witness about 45%. :)
