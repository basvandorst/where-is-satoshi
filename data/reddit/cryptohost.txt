I imagine a future where the pool pays the miners via LN.

Bitcoin is backed by the fact that it is a permissionless database. For the nay-sayers, even Lightning Network is permissionless, once you establish a few channels.
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:44:49
I'd like to see inputs+outputs / day, not tx / day.

LN wallets and channel factories for fast and cheap enrolment. A block size increase is still needed at some point.. at least to 1.44 MB

Really good buy signal IMHO.

You have not mentioned Roger Ver's payment channel solution called [thunder]( financed by BlockChain.com.
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:47:41
It couldn't work because of transaction malleability. Read the tickets. I'm really surprised nobody remembers this project, it was a pretty big thing at the moment.
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:20:19
The hard truth is that nobody really uses alts for paying anything, excepting Monero and probably Ethereum.

If Bitcoin hits 100.000 then all transfers less than 20$ will cost 20$ in fees. It probably won't hit 100.000$ unless MuSig or other improvements are ready.
@_date: 2019-07-12 17:29:29
BCH hasn't fixed TX malleability? I didn't know that. This thunder project happened when payment channels were just a cool thing to try - a total different era for Bitcoin.

How is Libra cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2018-08-28 15:10:49
The price is irrelevant on the long term. We should focus on building products that rely on bitcoin.

Just buy a small amount and forget about it.
@_date: 2018-08-29 18:44:14
We shouldn't be blaming Bitmain, as everything they did was in their own self-interest. This is what Bitcoin is based on.
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:13:17
What if someone makes another REAL uber, with REAL ride-sharing and gets invoiced in lightning? Today i drive you guys to the office, and you pay me a few satoshis, tommorow you drive me to the office, and i pay you with the satoshis i earned yesterday. This would be a real economic cycle of money, a killer app.
@_date: 2019-03-17 08:31:36
Bitcoin isn't really anonymous. We are also a [crypto VPS shop]( and we also support Lightning Network, which is way more anonymous. We already processed over 10 LN payment requests and we have no idea how the money got into our wallet. We're sure that it's there, though!
@_date: 2019-03-25 08:40:10
We should modify the block size from 1mb to 100kb. This should make bitcoin 10x more valuable.

Most likely not, and when they will do it, it will be too late.
@_date: 2019-11-23 12:32:51
Yes, but tying a message protocol over a payment protocol can easily solve the problem of spam:  
I'm willing to receive a message only if you pay me 2 cents, 5 cents, etc.
@_date: 2019-03-14 15:34:00
Several reasons:  
\- They'll be tempted to centralise or backdoor it  
\- Nobody wants to be   
\- If they do that, they legitimise bitcoin, and it's over for fiat money.
@_date: 2019-03-18 05:11:20
There you go, we've added more capacity. Now we can offer up to 350GB extra HDD.

We have a store which sells VPS for Bitcoin and Lightning Network, and we have no idea how we could possibly trace a transaction payed with LN, so it's already pretty private.

This is one of the best articles regarding Lightning Network scalability, and Bitcoin Scalability: [
@_date: 2019-10-12 08:25:01
There's a **chain** which **blocks** the ATM from being stolen, so i guess it's technically a **blockchain technology** in there.
@_date: 2019-08-24 08:07:04
Yes, but only one of them would have survived. I cannot believe Bitcoin SV is in top 15 coinmarketcap. It doesn't belong there. But then again, neither does XRP, and many others..
@_date: 2019-08-18 17:16:45
bluewallet ?
@_date: 2019-08-22 22:59:41
Bitcoin cash is a fork. If they had some courage, they shouldn't have changed the signature format, so any tx on BCH could get replicated on BTC and viceversa.
@_date: 2019-08-02 08:14:28
Nothing wrong with being a greedy miner.
@_date: 2019-08-17 10:27:46
Yes, also the mining difficulty would be very hard to calibrate.
@_date: 2019-10-11 09:54:03
AMP or moving to ELTOO-type channels instead of the current smart contract.
@_date: 2019-06-09 12:59:26
It's kind of difficult to enroll a lot of people to use it, because each new channel requires one tx.  
\- Atomic Multipath Payments aren't ready yet (pay one invoice over multiple channels - this is really BIG!).  
\- Adding funds to already open channels isn't ready yet (add more capacity to an already existing channel - this is BIG).  
\- Removing funds from a channel (this kind of exists in lnd + lightning-loop)  
\- Channel factories aren't ready (this is really cool, a classical bitcoin send transaction becomes a send + open channel)  
\- Integration with mainstream wallets (such as electrum)  
All in all, the tech is really solid, and it's the only way to go forward. There is no way to scale a cryptocurrency to a planetary level without using payment channels.
@_date: 2019-06-01 09:43:24
I just hope we don't get yet another address format. Also, we were promised that if we get segwit, we'll have easier upgrades, which don't require hard forks. Pretty exciting times!

@_date: 2019-02-10 09:12:32
I'd like to see further improvements in tx size before even talking about reducing the block size. We're doing pretty ok with 1MB. Luke lost my respect when he sneaked those [bitcoin address blacklist patches in gentoo](
@_date: 2019-02-12 14:44:18
We are a few steps away from a major breakthrough!
@_date: 2019-02-19 09:21:00
Start a business which accepts bitcoin and lightning network. This automatically:  
\- exposes more people to bitcoin  
\- earns you more bitcoin  
\- makes bitcoin more valuable
@_date: 2019-06-04 09:43:18
As a service which enables lightning-network payments, some of the improvements can't come soon enough. AMP, automatic rebalancing, swapping LN for BTC onchain to get your capacity back, etc.

C'mon man, just admit your mistake already.
@_date: 2019-02-13 13:20:43
This is from the Bitcoin Core website, which i fully support BTW:  
@_date: 2019-02-03 13:01:42
Yeah it's awesome. Our online store supports Lightning Network payments, and we had a few sales.
@_date: 2019-08-28 07:21:17
Not yet, but i hope they will manage to release it in the next version. They are working on their own implementation.
@_date: 2019-02-18 09:34:59
Very cool job, man! If you would like to rent a VPS for a month, we, [CryptoHO.ST]( also accept lightning network payments.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:20:48
As a merchant i will point out that people love to buy stuff with bitcoin when the price is high, but think twice when the price is low.
@_date: 2019-02-21 14:33:31
The transaction containing the older chainstate will be invalid for a few days, more like a week. A has to come online at least once a week.
@_date: 2019-06-10 05:55:11
There were at least 20 blocks in the last 24h when transactions with 1sat/byte confirmed. 1sat/byte is pretty low.
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:28:51
That's nice and all, but [CryptoHO.ST]( also supports Lightning Network payments.
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:43:47
Trouble is, i was there when it happened. I was running a machine with gentoo at that time and i clearly remember seeing the new ljr use flag and i didn't know what it was. After a while it stopped being enabled by default.

You can get a VPN from [CryptoHO.ST]( and pay with Lightning Network. Check us out!
@_date: 2019-02-07 10:50:37
LN is pretty effective as a mixer. If an adversary sets up a large number of nodes and channels, he may be able to figure out who is paying who, but it's very expensive.
@_date: 2019-02-15 20:25:35
There's less silver than gold on our planet, but gold is 100 times more expensive. This should tell you how real these prices are. If scaled properly, bitcoin could and will reach 1.000.000$.
@_date: 2019-02-13 07:13:28
I remember people asking for a increase from 1MB to 2MB with a line of code.


















This is unlike soft forks, whose deployments were initially managed by Nakamoto, where we gained experience from the complications in the [BIP16]( deployment, where we refined our technique in the [BIP34]( and where we’ve gained enough experience with BIPs [66]( [65]( to begin managing multiple soft forks with [BIP9]( version bits in the future.  








On the other hand, adding a line of code to lower the block size to 300kb is a-ok!
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:02:31
There you have it, bitcoin is truly dead.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:11:29
hello japan!

Everyone should be able to act as a node, for it to be truly decentralised.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:26:45
We need to keep our eyes on the prize. We just need to find an easy way to onboard a LARGE number of people on Lightning Network, using as little block space as possible. We then need really safe Loop In/Loop Out mechanisms, for stores and for consumers, which again, should use as little block space as possible. Then we could work on routing, as having millions of LN nodes comes with some problems regarding routing payments.
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:34:13
Hey man, grab a vps from us. You can pay with BTC and LN.

How many inputs/outputs can you fit into a schnorr signature? It can probably handle 128, but it can't possibly handle 1 million inputs.. or can you?

@_date: 2019-02-12 14:42:40

@_date: 2019-12-18 18:54:11
For small sums, it's fine.
@_date: 2019-02-13 07:26:44
It's probably one of those sidechains, such as rootstock.
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:52:25
This is why we need bitcoin. At least we can trace there the money goes.
@_date: 2019-04-19 08:41:46
The actual highlight, in my opinion, is this quote: &lt;&lt;As the Fed was lending this money, the dollar increased by 30% in value.  Grayson asks, was this a coincidence?  Bernanke's answer: yes&gt;&gt;.  
I don't think it was a coincidence.
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:19:16
Even better - they should implement Lightning Network.
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:23:00
If you are a developer with an online store selling anything, you should:
* run a full node
* set up bitcoin payments for your website
* set up lightning network
* fix whatever github issues you find while integrating bitcoin or lightning network with your store - this will help other people and will grow the network
With every Lightning Network enabled store or service we have, the incentive of closing channels gets lower and lower.
@_date: 2019-01-11 10:13:05
Yeah, solo mining will not help. But then again, as another guy said, if it were 1 million small miners, each mining with a 10/100 GHs on p2pool, it would make bitcoin a lot healthier.
@_date: 2019-01-30 11:05:00
@_date: 2019-01-30 11:43:47
Bitcoin cash isn't a fork per se. If you would run the original satoshi client on the bitcoin cash blockchain, it wouldn't work, but it would still run on the current one, due to replay protection.
@_date: 2019-01-11 09:19:54
If the pool where you're mining finds a block in a timely fashion, you ARE helping the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:53:25
Lightning Network is just a payment channels implementation, which indeed were planned in the early stages of Bitcoin by satoshi himself.
@_date: 2019-01-11 12:58:50
I've opened tickets whenever i found flaws, but this is the last issue that i had:
- How do you securely deploy? Do you proxy behind an nginx or not? If not, where do you put the certificates? How do you make the websocket work?
It basically just needs more real world usage, with more developers who try to install this software over their existing infrastructure. It needs 10x-100x more exposure.
@_date: 2019-01-11 11:11:21
The ecosystem around BTCPayServer needs a bit more work though.
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:52:33
The other party signs and broadcasts a transaction which encompasses the last known safe state. Your (the cheating one) can't confirm as fast as the good one.

@_date: 2019-01-22 08:53:36
Hold your horses, lightning doesn't solve everything. Lightning only works in the kind of economy where all the participants earn and spend the same amount of money per time interval. You need a lot of cycles where A pays B, B pays C, and C pays A. You will also need frequent payments, instead of monthly or weekly payments. If you work 1 hour, you should get payed after that hour. You must spend all your money as soon as possible on food or transportation, and get ready for the next wave.
@_date: 2019-01-17 11:54:16
It's true, you can already buy a vps from [our store]( and pay with lightning network.
@_date: 2019-01-17 12:12:16
Installing and integrating lightning is very far away for normal users. You need a rather large VPS to keep the bitcoin daemon, and another 2-3 smaller servers for nbexplorer, btcpayserver and a lightning node. You could keep them all on the same machine, but i don't feel it's very safe.
@_date: 2019-01-16 11:17:16
