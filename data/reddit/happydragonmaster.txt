Bitcoin is an infant. Of course it is befuddled. This is one tough kid though, and it will be alright. Nice analysis btw. You are goin places.

You are right. Noone absolutely needs to own BTC right now. Many people 'doubt', and that is coping mechanism to stay safe. Enough theory though.... "objectively better".... really?.... with the dev team bitcoin has around it?.... and ALL coins in the infant stage right now? You ever tried to USE coins other than BTC to prove your statement of 'objectively better'? I have and its been quite the crappy experience. So what is realy 'objectively better?
so yes, noone has to buy BTC.... noone had to buy internet service either.... plenty of places that provide it as a service. Just notice though... those fiber optic internet lines that are the foundation for the vast market cap of internet service...They are still the same old core T lines.
if public knowledge was reliable, then the silvery altcoin would not be so damn underrated and the fake and overrated bitcoin copy would not be in existance.

I appreciate your take on the asset side bitcoin and I agree with the scalabilty issue adding value to bitcoin. 
Lately I have been trying to find a historical comparison to help predict the long run. I found that bitcoin can be viewed as the original core internet lines  (T1) with fiber optic (cable) being viewed as a second layer like LN, and altcoins like the other types of internet connections.
Entities who are strong players always have and continue to use the strong expensive T1, and use cable where they want to save money and security is less of a concern. Then other entities use othet types of internet connections, but all trails lead back to the original, strong, and secure.
Just a theory, and I hope not too off base.... your post was just nice and thought provoking. thx

My moves have been made. I am enjoying the show the last few days; especially the day trader types with short to mid term strategies. Long hold and smart diversification wins (not a prediction - thousands of back-trade dryruns to prove). Seems like im part of the minority, but I spend some coin too... still waiting for 2nd layer like LN for small buys. Taxes are just part of the deal... sometimes people overthink and worry, and it rarely turns out like they thought. Bitcoin is like a large schlong.... its gonna swing back and forth and keep growing (regardless of "support priice analytics"). Exit strategy in place at my moon and maybe at some strange bitcoin ATM (kiosk) in a different country for a bit. Bring on 2018!

I see thisbottle neck theory as showing there are less reckless credit card using fomo investors.... thats nice to see.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:45:27
think about a prepaid credit card... it uses a logo that is tied to a pretty public company... bitcoin with lihtning network puts them to shame... everyone calm down and hodl through this 274th death of bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:45:51
to address all these speculations.... We cannot control other people, but we can control how we react to other people; and thus have control with redirection.... it is bitcoin karate.
I hope your plane arrives... its new years eve!

not sure how a donkey plays into maths... i have seen a squirrel analogy in a complex derivative, but no donkey.... Salty son, all i was doing was agreeing that if one simply holds, they make more. Now mind you, there are "secrets" to making a great roi by predicting people in crypto, but it has nothing to do with staring at one coin and trying to time it..... experience.... and good luck.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:07:55
it means, big picture, regs can work out, capitalists can work out, attacks can work out and make bitcoin stronger, .... strong jjust like a card with a logo... or better.

Upvote for sound advice.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:20:25
Been there, done that... just buy and hold on dips... want more proof? go set up yourself a trading bot, dowload hitoric bitcoin data, run backtests (this is where you can dry run your strategies without really spending your money), and you will then see that after 20,0000 variations of day trading strategies, you would have made much more just buying and holding bitcoin core. 
So how are these day traders doing it?.... most are happy thinking short to medium term.... the reality is bitcoin ATM (kiosks) will always be around for long term hodlers and receive better roi even worste case.
if you must feel u are making money regularly, then research crypto projects, understand the team, the sponsors, and you may be rewarded... I know i have more often than not.
I forgot to mention your main concern.... taxes.... yeay.... the more we pay means the more we made.  also can adjust losses with gains..... this is not financial advice but i believe 1099k tax forms are given either online or mailef by companies used. for example if you accept credit cards, you get a 1099k from the credit card processor you use for income to report.  so with cryptos, i believe 1099k are the future. easy peasy.
also i noticed a lot of fud lately.... ignore the noise... there are bad actors in every industry... crypto is here to stay.

exactly... as btc originally gained real monetary value, difficuly rose.... some miners went elsewhere and others joined the party; either way hashrate was affected... Now as we are in reverse, miners are at break even point and may very well be looking at other coins to mine.


I will concede that you have a valid point that miners don't control the market... mainly because of the countless other market variables. 
However, I hold my point that miners and hasrates do indeed help with analysis (basic supply and demand stuff) and knowing something rather than nothing can be a comfort.
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:49:49
You have asked a million dollar question.... The break even point for miners is a big part of the btc value equation.... especially a predictable part,... we just have to remember that many miners get free electricity or hardware and undercut regular maths...
The other part of the price equation is predictable too, but more psychology... like good news usually means price drop... Also, btc cant please everyone and someome is gonna get their feelings hurt; from the average Joe, to large institutions...
The last part of the price equation is that noone has a crystal ball.... anything can happen.... Players are gonna play.... fud and fomo is going to cycle....
Either way, miners need to break even, and we all can  count on that for a little comfort regarding btc value.

1) remember the genisis block and why "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks." .... fractional banking issues....no big bank issues right now... no worries
2).... hes dead .... even if funds moved , its 1/20th or so.... no mt gox type crash.......
3) remember cicada 3301 is secret....btc is always under attack and seems to be doing ok
4) off subject from OP but wad in comments and sick of seeing it... quantum computing does not stop bitcoin... there are many mining algorithms that are quantum proof and easy to impliment when the time comes... stop the fud lol

Yes Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin and hopefully somenoe will create a meme, webpage or someting to make sense of it all.
Here is my input:
1) Nick Szabo, a genius who denies, but may very well be Satoshi.... has stated bcash is "puppetry" and was againsted segwt2x.... sources.... google it please I am a very busy man.
2) Roger Ver, a marketing wiz who has shown the power of marketing.... rbtc was his because of his marketing..... bitcoin.com was his marketing....  lots of followers.... 
It's a tough pill to swallow for both sides... Again I think a good balanced meme could gain traction. good luck :)

A decentralized exchange that accepts vouchers bought with fiat. The vouchers are created by miners and are bought and delivered via a decentralized process. This removes the paradox of 'more security = less freedom'.... It is now 'more freedom = more freedom".
