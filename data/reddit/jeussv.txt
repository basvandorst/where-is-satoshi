if price rises it went up. if price lowers it went down

what exactly did he say?

it's quite a story and i will be using it in a talk i am.preparing. In a nutshell, they did everything right from begin to ending including posting the story 
everything can be improved, but what failed was bacjground checks. They do mention doing it so from a standard process perspective, it just hit the limitation of the human element. There is no way that absolutely prevents someon3 internal going rogue. It's life.
A few things though do seeem under perfect. Auditting for instance does hint that they were lucky and their logs could easily have been made invalid or compromised so they could have  ended up only with suspicions and no proof at all. Whereas Bob did look a bit of an amateur, the russian seemed yo know what he was doing.
I'll share my once it's ready.

thanks for the info but my problem is not how to place larger orders. It is more of a concern if something nasty is going on.
Bitstamp has been quite reliable and i do trust them but we never know.
@_date: 2016-04-17 12:24:25
good point
but still not sure if it will be so marginal. Bitstamp is a big one and has a 24h volume of around the 1800 magic number. Then, i'd assume most of the trading volume is people actually trading so the btcs should back on the system fast somehow netting no overall effect. or not

that's my impression also. 
i dont really see btc becoming a way to pay for coffee (or a car fwiw) any time soon or maybe never. I do see it as storage of value, fast/secure transactions outside banks (not meaning unregulated though), this internet of money ideas, maybe smart contracts, ...
but who knows

the article is technically flawed at many levels. If China suddenly exits bitcoin a block would still be pumped out every 10minutes.
Then if the new crypto does get traction it'd just replace the yuan and the world stays the same.

what surprises me is people still using btc-e when everybody else going as legal and compliant as they can.
dont complain when they go belly up and nobody even knows in which country they are based

thanks! editted

if that s a lot of money for you cash asap. Only invest in bitcoin if you can afford loosing money. Nobody knows how far this will go but one thing is sure: it will come down and hard at some point. It went up too fast.

that's an interesting way to estimate how much a btc would be worth if super massive adoption happens.
*napkin calculations*
Lets say the average savings of all 7B people is $1000/person (no idea; too lazy to google). To match up, at 0.0022 btc/person (someone below did the math), btc should raise to some $500k
If 1% adoption, that's $5000/btc
edits: missed a zero. 
and the $1000 should not be that far off. A quick google says the average american has $3000. 
Still, very true it ends up not that representative when the majority of people outside 1st world lives with dollars per day but it's probably good enough for napkin figures.

the chinese are just using btc to avoid controls. if the whole idea of bitcoin is to be used to avoid local regulations, it's doomed. it's just working for now. if it continues their govt shuts down everything bitcoin overnight.
plus i think this bubble is part China, part australian auction and part preempting the halving. i'm planning to sell some just before the auction and see what happens in mid july with the halving

we should use the right terminology and "difficulty" is an established concept in bitcoin. It s a dynamic parameter for miners. Don't come up with your own deifnition of difficulty or use it in a common-sense/nontechnical way.
You should rephrase because you re confusing people.
@_date: 2016-06-07 13:38:47
agree. that $500 per btc @ 1% actually ruined my day

this should be a sticky post. good job Economist -- fast response

even shorter TL;DR:
there will be no miners in business once all coins have been mined because fees will not cover the costs
valid point but it's easily solved with a HF. We only have to raise the coin limits.

so what exactly is the relation between mt gox and kraken?
@_date: 2016-05-24 21:38:24
where are you from? Portugal? Brazil?

is this the old article published last year?
@_date: 2016-05-27 11:58:57
I know the idea is the fee market but fees by nature will have to be low. So it all boils down to transaction volume. 
If fees are to stay at cents, and at current prices and assuming only a few big miners (say 10), transaction volume needs to be on the 1000s/second to pay off bills.
Bitcoin must reach that number if it wants to establish itself as a payment system but honestly i am not so sure of anything anymore judging by the block size discussion.
So I think the point is valid (not saying I agree with the fate) to start with -- and he may end up being right if bitcoin does not get decent steering. I would just not call it a design flaw. It's governance.
Or we just accept that btc is not good for payments (quite a defeat it'd be).

it makes sense but why all of a sudden? did they secretly all set last friday to do it? I d expect a much slower trend not this.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:55:17
indeed -- here, have my upvote

lets be fair -- SWIFT has *NOT* been compromised in any way and it is still quite a fortress.
What happened is equivalent to someone cloning a chip&amp;pin Visa card and somehow learning the pin -- and then stealing money from you with a PIN-verified transaction. You wouldnt blame Visa for this.

(only read the abstract)
TL;DR/ELI5 if you are an ISP you can partition the network up to the point where robust consensus cannot be reached.
Apparently it takes 900 prefixes which in practice means you need to be an ISP or a very large company.
I dont think this is serious because even a small company can easily cause havoc with misconfigured BGP routers. When it happens, and hasany times in the past, everyone will instantly know what is going on (BGP states are public) and correct the situation by removing (so to say) that ISP from the public routing.
Of course, if China decides to do it, it can kill Bitcoin. But no different in impact and likelyhood than the 51% issue.

EU decision of yesterday? (and pump&amp;dumpers)
edit: much simpler explanation: 
@_date: 2016-05-25 18:55:38
fair enough. it's just that some names sounded genuinely portuguese.
the idea is a bit confusing though judging from the site. what s fermat and what do you mean by p2p exactly?
the taxi drivers carry a server on their phones?
