So...spending doesn't lead to economic growth, then? Just capital investment?

Spending doesn't drive the economy. Imagine if I get my paycheck and spend all of it to buy some shirts. Then the person selling me the shirts goes and buys a shitload of apples. Then the farmer goes and buys a new TV. At no point is there any saving or investment back into any of the businesses involved here. Once the T-shirt producer runs out of shirts, they have to close shop. The farmer can't keep the farm going, because he spent all his money on a TV instead of fixing his equipment and buying material like fertilizer or mulch. 
     
Another thing to point out is the levels of inflation in places like the Weimar Republic. People would go and spend every dollar they had as soon as they got there paycheck, because they couldn't guarantee there money would be worth anything the next day or week. And we all know how well that turned out.

That's a fair point, but as far as I know, he follows the Austrian school of economics. Their thing is less 'the economy will crash within this specific time interval!' and more 'what the government is doing is probably going to fuck us all, it's just a matter of time!'. I just don't get the hate; let him promote gold, we'll promote BTC. I think a well balanced portfolio includes crypto and precious metals.

Bitcoin transactions have been performed via radiowaves over long distances, so it's plausible that the grocery store could transact with BTC

The second half is pretty accurate, though
Edit: second half of that sentence

Imagine if even 1 Satoshi ends up costing $1.

Panic sold my alts near the bottom. Bought them all back at the bottom. Didn't lose a whole lot, so that's a win, I guess?
