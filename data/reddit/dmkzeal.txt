Wish this isnt morphed if not great to see words from the Man himself.
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:19:49
Amazing !! It's like a prophecy out of him asking for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:44:53
Voila congratulations to you mate for receiving the first hand experience of peer to peer txn between different two different nationalities. I wish i could have the experience as yours. Who knows but i wont wish for my card been lost ��

The part of the graph which is outside of the redline seems vicious hope we be able to come out of that trajectory ones and for all.
@_date: 2018-05-04 20:50:14
I would also vote for that this is a total misleading case and conflict of interest from the bcash honchos.BTC Community should stand up for this cause.Indeed
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:14:55
Not true lately.All we are seeing dead cat bounce but still it will be worth watching if btc sustains level 10k+ and the way forward for now its very much sideways.
@_date: 2018-05-07 11:17:12
Such view are surely encouraging ! For the mass adoption and providing legitamacy to the bitcoin ecosystem
@_date: 2019-03-22 19:29:39
Glad you took to the wise decision to pare all your debt. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:30:03
Good for coinbase indeed.we need more than that from them.
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:21:51
Congratulations to the community. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:51:11
Who says volatality matters.
@_date: 2018-10-12 08:50:02
We have seriously bottomed out with the price i still beleive it will take another a year to recover fully.
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:30:43
Hopium helps indeed. Thanks.
@_date: 2019-10-11 19:01:10
100K possible by end of 2021.
@_date: 2019-10-27 13:27:22
Buy bitcoin and keep it safe somewhere between you and yourself loved ones.
@_date: 2019-02-02 11:38:20
Such a Irony ! May the departed soul rest in peace.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:45:28
Glad you didnt bought in 18K.
6K still a fair price. Keep Hodling ��
@_date: 2018-11-20 05:58:10
Bwahahahaha that was awesome i cant stop laughing sitting in my office desk.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:27:01
You should have dollar cost average yourself with the price. You should bought in tranches of 20 percent per downward movements. There is long call for bearish market. And bitcoin market isnt such unpredictable either.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:55:10


I hope you guys would have budgetted some resource toward marketing.
@_date: 2018-11-10 12:12:50
Ahan seems really interesting. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:03:01
Sure what i would suggest is to making shoutout to crypto community via their group invitation and interacting with the community at large. Few personals drumming the beat all over the place would help for sure.
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:14:02
Congratulations on owning one.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:11:09
True this will have a cascading effect from hodlers to traders to exchanges. Agree upon that.
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:13:48
I will bet 2800 usd is foreseable.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:51:14
How you are going to do outreach with your product.
@_date: 2018-11-22 08:00:49
One explainer video is also a must not very long just 1 min explainer whiteboard or animated video.
@_date: 2019-01-13 15:44:33
You could asked for some loan. Why ask for donation.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:21:57
Where are the reasons.
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:48:07
You can raise a request for a loan on r/borrow.
@_date: 2018-11-25 10:01:50
No not yet. Really blood will spills when btc breaks 2800 usd.
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:29:26
Seems nice. Best of luck sir .
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:08:12
Powerfull food for thought really! Great argument indeed.

Haha nice caricature.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:38:40
I  dont agree on your stand of what you earn all goes into bitcoin this is unwarranted. If you did so you didnt contributed in the genuine price of btc whats is worth of depending upon its usecase instead your give in too the profits of other who make you buy on high.
Its a Marathon Not a Sprint.
Make ends meet first. Then invest in crypto with your spare change.
@_date: 2019-09-21 06:10:34
Never heard off.
Likely a scam !! Stay a hands away.
@_date: 2019-09-20 10:11:06
@_date: 2018-04-23 07:57:53
Great occurrence indeed for all the Bitcoin community. Three cheers moment for all crypto-currency enthusiast.More to come for sure.

Woohoooooooo !!! Finally Psychology Resistance Cross.
Congratulations Bitcoin believers.
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:50:02

Finger cross !!
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:10:22

I wish to see banking been redundant in my lifetime.
