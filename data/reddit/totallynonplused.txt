Dude how clueless can you be? Do you really think that the people responsible for the Deutsch to be in the shit are the ones getting fired?

No, the first question asked will be, were did you get those bitcoins and show us your wallet and transaction ids.
You really have 600€ that are tax free but the rest needs to be declared. 
It’s the clever way the government found to take the piss if they don’t like you.

I’ll give the example of D4RK, you can either let your machine run for staking and serving as a peer or do cold staking and still serve as a peer.
The installation for cold staking is being implemented with the help of the devs and the community, the engagement is great and the software was really easy to install.
Do that with bitcoin , make it easy and worth to run a node and you will see more people running BTC nodes.

The problem are the banks, banks like Santander , BNP Paribas, Deutsche and the corruption they spread.
The problem in Europe is Germany using the smaller lands and their economies as a speculative weapon whenever the German Finance Ministry feels like it.
It happened during the latest recession following the financial crisis and it’s happening again, the banks , some people heads , namely managers and boards should have fallen and not saved at the expense of tax payers money and the stability of the markets that would have risen after the dust had settled.
That’s the problem , not Portugal , Spain and Italy.

Op you can paint shit any color you like it’s still gonna smell and it remains shit.
Dumping BTC like it has happened this time and getting a profit of it while making the market go down 10% is still manipulation.
I kinda wonder if the person is going to report the gains to the IRS.

Try to steal 1 billion from anyone and come back to tell us about it.

The only part I dislike about that article is where it’s stated that perhaps the stolen funds will be auctioned.
I mean, giving the money back to the people that got stolen is somewhat of a task but it would be the right thing to do IMO.
Good that these scumbags got caught anyways.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:57:19
Not quite like that.
If you mine or trade you have to pay regular taxes on your gains.
You also have to register the activity (mining).
The myth that you don’t pay anything after a year is dangerous because if the irs asks you were the money came from and start digging you risk getting fined or jailed for tax evasion.

You dont understand that romantics like you have absolutely no place in the real world.
Whether you like it or not bitcoin already is an object of speculation and will continue to be in the future. We better at the very least have it regulated.

Eth will either be a hit with the next coming update or the greatest exit scam in known crypto history. 
Somehow I can't shake the feeling that Vitalik claiming they want to build a super computer and web 2.0 was just buzzwords thrown around for people to buy into their thing. 
We'll see anyways how things develop, personally I never could comprehend how eth got so much value despite it being a ok experiment but not much more than that.

@_date: 2019-01-25 08:54:30
Jesus christ people they are talking about real world use cases, real applications that general consumers and enterprise grade entities can buy and use on a daily basis.
Not about bitcoin or whatever crapcoin you preach, they are talking about applications working over the blockchain framework. 
(This for the people saying coin xyz is doing fine)
@_date: 2019-01-29 08:12:02
The difference is.. bitcoin brings money to the IRS and warcraft gold is just peanuts in their minds...or who cares about game money.
If the IRS actually had a clue on how anything digital works and took a good deep look at the video game market and saw all that goes down there.. lol we would see alot of interesting shit going down.
And by the same logic we would see bitcoin and other coins properly evaluated and regulated. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:29:52
Only if you hold it for 1 year.
But, and let's get things straight because theres lots of people that think they know shit and then lead people to get fucked by the IRS. 
If you mine for example, you have to register yourself and declare the gains of what you mine.
If you trade in currencies , a short example, Fiat&gt;BTC or BTC&gt;ETH or vice versa you get taxed on the gains.
This shit is not known enough because the usual suspects just read , 1 year no pay, but they conveniently forget to mention that the market here is regulated. 
Open and exchange and see what you pay for it, open a pool the same, if you make gains you have to declare them.

Same rules worldwide? Not banned in some? Same tax percent? Same classification? Can you invest with btc? Is it a currency, a store of value or both?
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:52:11
Wrong, the market doesnt care because nothing is working properly at the moment.
We should care because it's not just nerd power that will make btc soar.
Institutional use along with consumer use will make btc a successful event.

It is only volatile as long as people allow the btc forks to live on.
There should be bitcoin only , not bcash or bgold.
With these clones out of the board things would be much more efficient.

The Deutsche Bank should not be trusted. Among banks they are one of the least trustworthy and most manipulative entities you can find in the sector.
Don't be surprised if these guys somewhere in the future propose to classify btc as some sort of share or security with high tax rates , btc or any other coin that catches their personall interest.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:47:02
Bitcoin is actually quite stable as a currency, or could be, if it were not for bcash and the people behind it making sure the market remains a roller coaster so that they can line in their pockets.
The moment regulation comes, and make no mistake it will come, Bitcoin is the number one crypto currency that has proven to withstand crashes and its already 1000 deaths that people predicted.
Don't forget that most of us are either IT nerds, Finance nerds but very few are both or have a foot in both worlds and most people will want BTC down just because something hot and new is making a show while the ones that understand a bit of both worlds know that only 1 or 2 crypto currencies will remain plus a handfull of utility tokens with real world use, approval and support, the rest will die off or get merged into something bigger.
BTC has everything to be digital gold, and thats whats going to happen if the banks in Europe start making reserves of Bitcoin as already announced in several financial newspapers, you will trade with it and its worth is going to rise.
The original post is just the first step in what is unavoidable and unstoppable, BTC is going to stay and is going to estabelish itself, whatever some companies might say Governments have the last word and if the US States and EU Lands aquire BTC as reserve then they will want to defend that aquisition and make no mistake , once accepted there is no turning back. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:41:41
Im thinking more along the lines of all the info is permanently stored in the blockchain and Institutional entities cannot buy "toilet seats" for 100K and say the money went to some community project.
This actually ends some of the issues that the few honest politicians and other authorities have with tracking money that never reached its intended destination.
BTC also ends one of the oldest problems plaguing fiat currency, counterfeit money, i mean this is the best thing that could happen to governments and to the people in general.
So yes, i agree with you mate :) 
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:33:58
This is actually good news.
This means the state is accepting and starting endorse the use of BTC which is a big plus in my cryptobook.

You forget that the electronics market and the medical world use gold ( gallium and antimony) for components so this would actually be positive for the end consumers making the parts cheaper reflecting on end product prices.
It would take some time but this could spurn the development of space industry and actually alleviate the issue of lack of jobs on earth.

What antitrust laws did Microsoft violate?
A federal judge issues a stinging rebuke of Microsoft, saying the software giant violated antitrust laws. WASHINGTON--A federal judge has concluded that Microsoft violated antitrust laws by leveraging its monopoly position in operating systems to capture the market for Web browsers.Jan 2, 2002
Later on Netscape was bought by AOL and moved to release the source code for Mozilla.
The thing with MS is that what they can’t bully or buy they slowly take over.
It’s one of those perverted traits from Microsoft that anyone that has been in the business for ages has learned to appreciate.
