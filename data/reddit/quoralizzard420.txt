Lbc admins laughing straight to the bank 
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:48:06
\^finally a sensible comment
@_date: 2018-09-11 08:46:11
\^I agree. Their poor customer support is one of the reasons why I chose paxful over lbc. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 08:35:34
localbitcoins doesn't care about their users anymore smh :/ 
@_date: 2018-09-17 07:19:03
don't you mean scammer-central-dot-com

Other crypto companies should follow. It's slowly changing the world for the better. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 10:10:49
but will they do something about it is the real question 
@_date: 2018-10-23 09:36:44
Seems localbitcoins and 'scammers' are almost synonymous with each other these days.
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:16:12
A few months ago local bitcoins was hacked. This kind of news is like adding fuel to the fire I'm sure this will dampen their customer base, the competition out there is strong.

You can easily buy bitcoins with western union using paxful in Jordan. I got curious and looked up the deals and I found that there are sellers in your country.

I gotta use the phrase "supremacist banker brethren" more often.

It's not even a conspiracy anymore, that's exactly what's happening. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:47:08
It's the fact that peer to peer platforms have a much more human aspect. You can do background checks on the people you trade with and the fact that they're actual people kind of enhances the security you feel during trades.

Localbitcoins is run by shrek. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:04:53
Unlike 'some' 
@_date: 2019-01-21 09:42:07
There's a lot of fake apps out there that can easily be downloaded via Google Play Store that has been sitting there for years. If a website like paxful doesn't feature an app on their website, then the app simply doesn't exist. Better report it.

@_date: 2019-01-22 06:11:43
Do you have old screenshots of that 
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:17:17
I agree. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:47:29
Does anybody know where can I watch the entire thing? 
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:16:38
It's a weird time to be alive, even the invention of bitcoin itself still amazes me to this day. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:26:42
It's not working.
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:31:42
I don't want to hand out my personal information to localbitcoins. I read somewhere they sell their user's info to government entities.

People try to rig the system for their own advantage and cry foul when they get suspended or banned. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 09:32:32
What could be the reason for a dramatic drop?
@_date: 2019-01-18 11:20:34
Yep. Don't use localbitcoins
@_date: 2019-01-14 10:05:48
Their support is by far the worst I've ever encountered. Good luck mate, I hope you get your coins back.
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:39:34
Localbitcoins is always known for shady 'errors' like this.
