Hello, New to this and hoping for some understanding. Bought in when price was 5900. I was looking at trying to get into trading. If I sold at say 7900 and bought back in at say 7500 if it dips that low again, I would be getting less bitcoin at 7500 then I bought at 5900 so there wouldn't be much gain right? Trade or hold?

Ok, did not ask right. Bought 200 dollars worth when it was 5965 and got .0168. Bought another 200 dollars worth when it was 6995 and it was .0163. Was wondering if it would of been worth trading and buying back in now at 7500 getting less bitcoin at a higher price then at it was at 5965. Only been gaining 60 to 70 dollars. Would the gains be worth it. I have never traded yet. I can do math fine!

Thanks guys, I wish I could have bought a whole coin. Then it would be easier to understand. In it for only .062 right now. Rest in eth and litecoin.
