Win Thin in this video loses the plot on bitcoin by calling it unreliable. Forgets to check bitcoin price history from before 2013.

The country is encouraging adoption of electronic transactions instead of cash payments to bring in accountability and increase the efficiency of economic system. Digital currency has also garnered the interest of the Reserve Bank of India’s governor. We can expect the Indian Bitcoin community to grow huge as internet connectivity improves across the country.

Bitcoin is not about money, its about power. From understanding the long history of money and that every fiat money is subject to fail; we see the economic power of bitcoin. To understand that bitcoin has loyalty to no state or corporation displays its very political nature. Instead of being controlled by politicians and bankers, bitcoin is powered by a league of cryptopunks scattered around the global. The internet itself has become an ideological apparatus with its own loyalty, culture, and now economic tool. This is what make bitcoin political.
