Bitcoin is soooo last year, you need to get on the ground floor of my new crypto: ShartCoin. It's gonna be a graveyard smash!

Yep, all my savings are in Bitcoin and Litecoin. I'll be laughing all the way to the bitbank when the global economy collapses in 2019.

For cryptos in the middle east, you'll be wanting GlobexCoin (GXC). Ask your local broker.

The State, in the words of Oppenheimer, is the “organization of the political means”; it is the systematization of the predatory process over a given territory. For crime, at best, is sporadic and uncertain; the parasitism is ephemeral, and the coercive, parasitic lifeline may be cut off at any time by the resistance of the victims. The State provides a legal, orderly, systematic channel for the predation of private property; it renders certain, secure, and relatively “peaceful” the lifeline of the parasitic caste in society. Since production must always precede predation, the free market is anterior to the State. The State has never been created by a “social contract”; it has always been born in conquest and exploitation. The classic paradigm was a conquering tribe pausing in its time-honored method of looting and murdering a conquered tribe, to realize that the timespan of plunder would be longer and more secure, and the situation more pleasant, if the conquered tribe were allowed to live and produce, with the conquerors settling among them as rulers exacting a steady annual tribute.

The last thing you'd want in your Burger King burger is someone's foot fungus. But as it turns out, that might be what you get.

Yeah let's harass a customer support team and clog up their system, making them slower to respond to people who actually need customer support.

Duh! I started mining Bitcoin in 1976, and now I'm filthy rich because my computer says so. :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:19:16
A whole day and no answers? All right, I'll field this question because it's actually a good one.
Bitcoin is a middle finger to the government, so paying taxes on it is the antithesis of what Bitcoin is trying to achieve.
The kind of people who buy Bitcoin are the same kind of people who do not pay taxes. So don't worry about it. This is the freedom that the future of crypto can provide, my friend. Spend some of those so-called "taxable earnings" on a well-earned bottle of champagne. ;)
