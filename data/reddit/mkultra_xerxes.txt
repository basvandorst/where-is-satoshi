Yeah, it's irritating to hear these senile old men crow at every dip because they missed the boat, they hate everything new, they don't understand the blockchain, and they just want us off their lawn.

random sounds like suicide, regardless of any short term anecdotal data. 
I have a bot I wrote that interfaces with kraken. It uses moving averages as an indicator to buy/sell/long/short bitcoin. 
That being said, you should expand your code to look at currency pairs of multiple cryptos instead of being tethered to usd. 
For example, watch btc/xmr and btc/ltc and btc/xrp. If you are in a btc position, examine all the btc/xxx pairs to find the one that has dropped the most in the last interval (say, 4 hrs). When you find one that has 'crashed' the most, buy it. You are now buying cheap coins with the expectation that it is oversold, and will rise. This wont always be true, but on average, it will be. 
Now you are in an xmr position for example, and you look to see what xmr/xxx pairs have crashed the most in the period. xmr/btc is down 10%, xmr/ltc is down 5%, xmr/eth is up 1%. You would buy the cheapest (xmr/btc) and now you are in a btc position so you refactor looking for cheap btc/xxx pairs. 
I call this value buying. Value buying plus trading on moving averages for buy/sell signals,  would love to see that..
the volatility can be leveraged to your advantage by a bot that is always watching prices for 16-32 pairs. The more pairs you add, the more complexity you have(exponentially so), but also more overall volatility (which is a good thing).
if you watch btc, ltc and eth thats 9 ossible combos
if you watch btc, ltc, eth and xmr thats 16 possible combos
it can be expressed as y=n^2 where n is the number of pairs you watch and y is the total combinations
I appreciate the article on algo trading, as it is a subject near and dear to my heart.
Example pairs to watch:
    btc/usd
    ltc/usd
    eth/usd
    dash/usd
    xmr/usd
    xrp/usd
    
    usd/btc
    ltc/btc

People DO use btc as currency. I assume you have never been to Japan, where it is available as a payment method in almost every store and shop? The reason its not available as much in the states because banks and visa and all those guys actively block its adoption. But they wont be able to keep it suppressed forever.

If it's worth anything I've been using kraken for a while now. Back when they had the advanced trading options the website would crash half the time and be offline for hours. Ask anybody who is a kraken user. This shit is very commonplace. They made a bunch of changes to try and tweak the database performance which includes removing some of the pairs, decreasing the number of decimal points in the price, and removing Advanced trading options. After they did this I've been through several *hardcore, gutwrenching dips* with massive volume the last couple days especially, and their website is been up probably 98% of the time for me at least.
While I agree with you that removing stop loss and take profit orders is complete irresponsible bullshit, I don't think that there was malicious intent, I think it was truly performance-related.. if I were still using their old user interface, it would have crashed during the first dump and I would have been completely liquidated.

People will call you conspiracy theorist. But you are 100% correct. This is a coordinated attack from China the elite 1% in the United States government with their propaganda apparatus. This sheer explosion of negative press over the last week is a clear demonstration of that. You can see how they try to tie Bitcoin to murderers, drug dealers, pitos on the dark web, North Koreans, terrorists . This sort of propaganda has the Hallmarks of the deep state. When taken with the convenient timing of the China ban really begs the question who *actually* runs the world? 
Collusion between all of these forces doesn't really jive with what we read in the media about the existing power structures of the world. I'm just saying Chinese government US government Elite 1% and propaganda apparatus all operating together to manipulate the price of Bitcoin... they make strange bedfellows?

It's not a scam this is a coordinated effort between the government of China the elite 1% the United States government and their media propaganda apparatus to attack Bitcoin.
I don't think that they intend to destroy Bitcoin because they know that they can't. Just drive the price down to the point where they can greatly enhance their positions in the cryptocurrency space at a relatively cheap price.. 
if anything a coordinated attack by the 1% on bitcoin so that they can lengthen their positions would be a bullish indicator long-term for me.

Not necessarily true. There are plenty of places where you can do work online for Bitcoin. There just needs to be a wider push into adoption in places like grocery stores and convenience stores. If this were accomplished you could live on bitcoin and never actually touch the US dollar. you you can sidestep the Fiat system entirely

The thing is though is that the u.s. dollar is ubiquitous worldwide. Which means it would be possible to run an exchange outside of the United States that traded in US dollars. For example the country of Ecuador uses the u.s. dollar as their currency. They could ban American exchanges but Banning people from treating Bitcoin with USD would be a much more difficult task. Plus with the demand for u.s. dollar versus Bitcoin Trading any Exchange that opened offering the service after the ban would immediately get a million customer

i agree with you in your overall theory, you overestimate bitcoins ability to overthrow trillion dollar governments. The chinese are having a come to jesus moment right now, realizing that their actions have had little effect on bitcoin, and all they have done is exclude themselves from the new economy. they will do a 180 when this realization hits home. I think they have been gaming the market to scoop up cheap coins anyway, and their line on it has been for fud purposes only.

No worries, I am only down like $3200 at the moment. This is why you always keep plenty of free margin. I did not expect to have to use 100% of my free margin, but this was excellent fud and well played by the chinese.

@_date: 2017-09-15 06:55:07
People will call you conspiracy theorist. But you are 100% correct. This is a coordinated attack from China the elite 1% in the United States government with their propaganda apparatus. This sheer explosion of negative press over the last week is a clear demonstration of that. You can see how they try to tie Bitcoin to murderers, drug dealers, pitos on the dark web, North Koreans, terrorists . This sort of propaganda has the Hallmarks of the deep state. When taken with the convenient timing of the China ban really begs the question who *actually* runs the world? 
Collusion between all of these forces doesn't really jive with what we read in the media about the existing power structures of the world. I'm just saying Chinese government US government Elite 1% and propaganda apparatus all operating together to manipulate the price of Bitcoin... they make strange bedfellows?

yeah that's my problem too. I am working through the logic of it, but its slow going. I am importing data for multiple pairs into a database and comparing them in real time, so I am close to a working model, just have to finish tweaking some code here and there.
The code itself is the easy part, its the logic and the timing of the trades. But the more pairs you look at, the higher probability that one will be down 10, 15, or 25% at any given moment, which gives you the possibility of explosive growth.

might work, or you might get rekt. I did something similar, and made out big. Was I savvy or just dumb luck?

lol funny but I am witnessing the largest most well organised  Market manipulation in history. Only the willfully ignorant would disagree. I'm just spitballing here I'm trying to figure out why they're doing it and who's doing it so I can place my bets accordingly

I have no illusions. I am well aware that the narcos, the banks and the CIA are good buddies, and this whole war on drugs is a shell game and a distraction. That's why nobody has smuggled in a backpack nuke or biological weapons using drug tunnels, because the cartels wont allow it. The CIA lets them sell their drugs, they get a cut, and a nice agreement to not allow anything except drugs through. It's not rocket science.
That being said, digital currency is a perfect solution for them as a store of value as well as for transactions.

It's not a scam this is a coordinated effort between the government of China the elite 1% the United States government and their media propaganda apparatus to attack Bitcoin.
I don't think that they intend to destroy Bitcoin because they know that they can't. Just drive the price down to the point where they can greatly enhance their positions in the cryptocurrency space at a relatively cheap price.. 
if anything a coordinated attack by the 1% on bitcoin so that they can lengthen their positions would be a bullish indicator long-term for me.

ideological echo chambers serve nobody. This is the problem in the usa with the red vs blue crowd. They shut out dissenting opinions and  then all sit around agreeing with each other and feeling smug. This is a bad recipe for change and innovation, which is what bitcoin needs.
