No one knows for certain how any investment is going to behave but you can look at trends to make a judgement call. It would be pretty likely that after a run like this that there will be a "correction" where the value drops but looking at the performance of Bitcoin it should then run to a new ATH. Also there is a "hard fork" looming in November which will impact value (my guess is down, while things play out) then, it will likely trend upwards again.  Saying that, it might just shoot to the moon! If you buy now just know that a drop is likely but it will pick up again (so whatever you do, don't forget to hold). Alternatively wait for a low to get in cheaper then wait for the rise.

You can, but essentially Coinbase hold the keys to your wallet and my understanding is that you are going to want those keys, particularly when the hard fork occurs in November

Essentially you start by purchasing bitcoin from an exchange (coinbase is a simple way to do it). You are then going to want to set up your own wallet (coinbase do provide you one but they hold the keys to it) which you can do on your phone or with some hardware (ledger nano s for example). Once you have purchased your bitcoin you can send the bitcoin to your wallet and then back that wallet up so it is secure.

I took some time looking into it and landed on Mycelium. By all accounts one of the best Android options - it doesn't have the prettiest UI in the world but it does the job well

You can set alerts on coinbase which appear as notifications in your phone (by amount not percentage though)

Don't worry, a lot of us are figuring this out for the first time (which is great as the more the merrier). One bitcoin is going to set you back a few grand depending on where in the world you are and you are going to definitely want to secure that in your own wallet (either app based on your phone or as a hardware wallet - which most agree is the best option).
Once you set up your wallet you will have an address for it, which is a series of numbers and letters. In coinbase you go to your BTC wallet and hit the blue plus sign and select send. Punch in the address of your wallet and transfer the coin. I'd recommend trying to send a little just to be sure it works then send the rest. Also be sure to secure your wallet asap. This will generate a password consisting of 12 random words, which means you can access your BTC even if you lose /wipe your phone /hardware wallet. Don't forget to note the words down somewhere safe!

No problem at all. Learning about BTC and how it all works is part of the fun. I'm not an iOS guy so can't give you a solid recommendation but I'm sure someone here will be able to give some pointers. My advice though is, if you're going to drop that kind of $ on BTC, then go all out and get yourself a hardware wallet. Ledger Nano S seems to be the one most recommended (I'm ordering mine tonight) - it's the most secure option.

Do you mean transaction fees? If so the short answer is all exchanges charge a fee for straight purchasing of Bitcoin so have a look at the options and decide which one you are comfortable with. In regards to the nano. It's all about security. If you are investing a decent sum into Bitcoin you may as well spend the extra $100ish for piece of mind. A wallet on your phone is very secure as well so it's not an imperative to go the hardware route.
