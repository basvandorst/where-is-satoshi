Mining with a partner and buying it directly myself at the same time.

I suppose if that is important to you then yeah get yourself a Tesla. 
But I like a car with some soul, which frankly has more to do with look and feel than sheer performance. There will ALWAYS be another car that gets to 60 faster than yours, or laps the ring faster, or has 50 more horsepower.
So for me I'd forget about all that shit and get the car that feels the best to own and drive.
Personally I'd take the Lambo over the McClaren for that reason. But it is a matter of taste anyway.

Also GenX and my kids think my miners are just another crazy thing dad is building. I think they are a bit embarrassed by them actually. 
I don’t think millennial as are in a place yet in their lives to adopt bitcoin (very generally speaking of course). When I was that age investing was the furthest thing from my mind. 
But inevitably wealth will have to transfer from generation to generation so I suppose the statement is correct. But that transfer of wealth will have more to do with dying boomers than bitcoin. 
When it does happen though, GenX and millennials will be better able to adopt crypto as a currency and/or store of wealth

I've been trying to accumulate one bitcoin for a year now. Of course once I get there, and assuming the price hasn't gone out of reach, I'll start working on two.
What I have been doing the last 6 months or so is to bracket the current price with limit buys and sells roughly $500 - $1,000 above and below the current price. But the sells are always for .05 BTC and the buys are for .1 so when they both get triggered I net .05.
Not too long ago I had both triggered on the same day. It's tough cause it takes patience as nothing happens for days or even weeks at a time, but so far the result has been a steady accumulation while my average purchase price just keeps going down.
Yesterday I finally got to .95 so I am oh so close... unless of course the price jumps and triggers my .05 sell order. At some point as we get closer to May I will probably remove the sell limit order for a several months while the halving plays out.

Uhhh, it's a model. it is literally ALL assumptions. That's how it works.

Yep, that’s my story. Except with the added wrinkle that my first interaction with crypto was building a miner. So now if I do anything related to bitcoin, like say transfer money from checking acct to coinbase I get a text like “you’re really spending a lot of money on this mining thing”

It'd be worth more than $10K if it was TRON I think. I've owned it since the late early 2000's. It was related to website I wanted to start back then but never really did. So now it has no meaning really. but there are a couple of organizations that could use it as Initials, and I am pretty sure the $10K offer came from one of them.

Well... I guess I’m a hoarder so I’m just gonna hang on to it. I don’t have the time or energy to turn it into a brand. I do use it as a source of short email addresses sometimes.

This kills the bitcoin

A poorly informed decision is not necessarily the wrong decision. The best financial decision of my life was poorly thought out.

Funny thing I own a domain name, not even premium but it’s 4 letters so it is rare. My last offer for it? $10,000.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:45:04
Yep. A little anyway. Helped my journey to a whole bitcoin.

What are the odds that his projected odds are wrong? Maybe there is only a 5% chance he is wrong, but a 95% chance he is wrong about his odds?
@_date: 2019-09-11 20:34:35
Not true. If you could be wrong 95% of the time you can convert that to bring right 95%. 50/50 is good for nothing.

Doing the right thing for the wrong reason.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:57:40
Haha, it's been about 7 hours. And yeah I've made some money since then. Even as we speak I am roughly 85% BTC, 15% cash.

This is going to sound like such a lie but I literally entered a limit order at $8500 yesterday “just in case”. After it shockingly filled today I ended up with an unpleasantly non-round number so I put in another at $8400 to round it to an even 10th which filled almost immediately. 
I think a feel better about the rounding fill. Lol. 
I probably should not disclose at this time but my other “just in case” limit order is for $6500.

For what it's worth I have been using it as a rough tool for trading it. Nothing too complicated but when it is over the stock to flow price prediction I am a "seller" and when it is below I'm a "buyer". In a practical sense I am just less of a buyer when it is higher.
So right now the price prediction is $8,341 and we are over, and as such I have been buying less and holding cash. And wouldn't you know it, the price has been going down. I would not be 100% in until the price hit 50% of stock to flow, or $4,200.
Time will tell.

It actually is a fact.
