If that's true, the title is misleading as fuck.
@_date: 2018-09-10 11:59:01
Thanks man, I'll look into it further.

Oh I know, I was just surprised to see a Bitcoin for Dummies book in french in Gatineau out of all places. Mass adoption here we come!
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:28:51
Wow that's unheard of! I wonder how much we'll get back from that whole Bitgrail shitshow...
@_date: 2018-09-09 19:44:04
Thank you for clarifying things. Where can I get some info on what the approximate cost and data usage of running a full node + validating payments?

Nice, you must be from Ottawa. Beautiful nature around there.

Carlos Matos?
@_date: 2019-03-27 11:55:32
What's your average return like how many BTC you earn per day?
@_date: 2019-03-22 23:21:56
I wish I could see her toes.
@_date: 2019-03-14 18:02:49

Are you able to medicate with cannabis? Provided you're in a legal state.
@_date: 2019-03-19 01:17:53
What's fiat on/off ramping like in VZ? Or some people just deal in crypto?
What are some popular crypto currencies in Venezuela?
I feel for you guys. [Some guy from VZ made an article about how they were earning more money playing faucet games than working for minimum wage over there.](

Holy shit Gold is above $1,500 and silver above $17!!! I haven't been paying attention to those charts truthfully because the price movement is so slow compared to stocks and crypto but that's some solid gains in the right direction.

Yea Jack, put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2019-02-21 12:45:32
Well said, thank you.
@_date: 2019-04-17 12:13:20
That's awesome, thanks for sharing.
Look at Ethereum's performance, tried to compete with BTC than it just dropped out of the race.
@_date: 2019-04-20 11:18:28
Yea it was bittersweet for me, I was thinking what are the tax consequences of this disposition ��
@_date: 2018-11-05 00:09:40
I feel for all my Venezuelan brothers and sisters, this shit is insane! Fuck the bolivars!
@_date: 2018-11-05 00:02:12
That's insane. Shit like this will only help grow BTC and Venezuela is not the only country that will experience this. Hell people are buying food with r/banano a meme coin which is being distributed for free.
