Something went terribly wrong during update. I think they fucked up database  and something is wrong with backup. Now they are trying to fix existing data, however this can be hard if changes were really extensive.

Is there any way to ask them to remove all my data associated with my account? Specifically my ID and address and anem.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:47:36
yep, did it some time ago. However it looks like twitter doesn't care unless some authority that owns the brand contacts them. This is however impossible in this case since btc is decentralized.

No, you have to gift Bitcoin. Bitcoin won't be taxed.

no, bitcoin is bitcoin, bcash is altcoin. bitcoin segwit2x is altcoin. This post does not belong to this form.

lol, it has to go in block first. So you always have to wait at least 10 minutes. Wait for LN, that will make it immediate.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:31:11
so which one should we use? bit, mBitcoin, mBit, satoshi? We should at least decide on this and stick to one term
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:13:00
I think there are two legal options.
1) Gift the money/BTC to your relative. You don't pay taxes on gifts. But I think theres some upper limit, but I believe its 5 mil.
2) Change your residence to tax heaven - Monaco for example.
Fuck taxes.

@_date: 2017-11-27 21:05:19
Probably some anti fraud and anti money laundering rules. This is to protect both you and coinbase from huge loses.

Finally someone giving a responsible answer. I would also add one thing - tell her you bought btc before you met her/got married(this may be true according to your given timeline). This way she is not eligible to btc in case you get divorced.

@_date: 2017-09-25 12:56:12
Bitcoin simply isn't your standard day to day currency. It is more of a commodity that, because of its scarcity, has high potentional to be very stable value in future. Simply said, bitcoin in it's current state can be compared to gold. This is because blockchain tech doesn't allow you to scale to fiat currency level. To reach such level you would need at least 1000 times higher transaction per second bandwith. This will be achievable once LN goes live. Only then we will be allowed to compare bitcoin to fiat currencies. Until then it's just a commodity like gold.

@_date: 2017-09-18 13:21:22
Yes, that is the only problem. But volatility is expected to go down in future. Also bitcoin price tends to go up compared to other major fiat currencies, so volatility that goes up is beneficial to everyone who uses bitcoin.

They are making money of your purchase. Scamming 3 BTC is not worth losing trading volume of several thousands BTC each day.  This generates far more BTC from fees than your BTC balance.
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:07:42
I personally wouldn't do bussiness in country that has currency that is unstable, with high inflation rate, is easily falsified and hard to buy or sell. 
This is basically majority of African currencies and some Asian currencies. Bitcoin solves all of this(except for volatility, for now..) and is relatively cheap to integrate.

Unfortunatelly it is considered money laundering and casinos do have a system to prevent it. Otherwise every criminal would use casinos to money launder. Probably this was the case in the past and reason why money laundering prevention was introduced.

I don't really understand why 2X is even relevant anymore. 
If you want 2x, there is already a 2x altcoin. Choose one, but please don't create another abomination that will just confuse people.(I guess this is one of the reasons - to scam new people to crypto ecosystem)

I just don't understand why is anyone taking him seriously anymore. He supports two forks that contradict themselves and are direct competition to each other. It's pretty clear he only wants to increase his wealth with both bcash and this fork.

This can be so many reasons. It likely sounds like a card limit problem.
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:53:09
so far you guys failed to give me any valid arguments to convince me to stay in btc.
@_date: 2017-10-12 14:28:49
Your argument was basically - throw money at bitcoin, becuase it was volatile in past and rose quite a bit. This was basically everyone few years ago. Just throw money at bitcoin and gamble, without even trying to explain fundamentals or why it is a sound investment.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:13:59

where do you see 5k?
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:54:25
For majority of people (95%), trading won't be profitable. It might be in a short run, but in span of several years they are very likely to go broke.  
  
Gathering information about certain coins simply isn't enough. Price is usually decided by people who are sitting on fat stacks of cash. These guys decide when some coin will be pumped and for how long. These guys are then slowly gathering dumb money of small traders. Price rarely reflects the technical quality of coin or experience of dev team..    
  
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:42:37
Bcash nor Bgold forks were motivating me to sell. A fork that has 80% of miners and BTC business behind it is scary.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:15:20
so your investment is 15% down since you invested. This is pretty standard. Ask yourself why you invested in Bitcoin. If you still think your reasoning is correct, hodl. If not, sell. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:58:02
Does it mean you can already sell your B2X token for BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-31 08:31:39
cool, thanks for this. Sell prices look pretty bad, but maybe still better than paying taxes.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:11:13
You should just feel bad about fiat money you have sitting in your account. That money is just losing its value and does nothing for you.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:04:45
Yep, same thing with Stellar. Companies are interested in tech to create their private blockchain db. Why would they ever want to use a public blockchain that has token with some variable price? Also why would they share their private data with public? Some people are just dumb, but bitcoin can feed on this dumb money :)
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:57:50
Me too, but fuck I'm scared. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:59:21
I think you can actually gain quite a large competetive advantage. Early adopters of future tech are usually the ones that will be leading the world in near future. For example if some developing african country decides to adpot bitcoin, it will greatly increase their chances of attracting bussiness. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:37:05
Ofc, just saying that Bitcoin gold fork was planned on 25th so thought you want to get in.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:45:57
This whole fork is a risky and dangerous. I'm pretty sure they are willing to risk everything if some major returns are possible. They will probably hope in B2X price pump to continue and BTC dropping in value and them rebuying BTC used for pump. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:46:53
sounds like some serious  bug
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:50:15
afaik bgold has no replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-20 12:08:39
Can someone check their IP? I'm pretty sure most of them will be deployed on some major cloud service.  
  
I believe there was some tweet with that contained info about Bizzcoin team creating docker installation for btc1 nodes.
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:17:46
Well didn't know they are planning for it. It certainly makes sense to have replay protection in order to not make it worthless. However afak bgold is supposed to launch on 25th of October and it's not implemented yet? Sounds fishy to me. God knows what bullshit will be coded in their fork. Not sure if it woth 10 buck or so per BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:17:21
Money laundering is way of making shady unofficial income official and legal. For example: drug money, bribes, etc... With your logic, all these people could just ask the guy who is bribing them(or buys their drugs) to pay them with casino chips. This way their income would be official, because they would officialy win that money.  
  
This is obviously not possible otherwise everyone would be using it. And I'm pretty sure that everyone who tries to do your method, risks a lot for extra $100 per bitcoin. Caino could actually refuse to give you moeny for your chips and will refund them to your buyer instead.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:46:18
I worked for online casino and there were many AML rules. Transfering money, lets say during poker, would definitely trigger one of them. Handing over chips from person to person without you ever playing a game would be again suspicious.  It may work once, but I doubt you won't be noticed second or third time. 
  
AML checks are all part of casino license. If casino fails to enforce them, they will lose their license.   
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:13:18
Bitcoin was created with honest intentions to improve current banking system and give control of world from banks back to people. There was no shady ICO. It was first. It has best devs. It is the mosts adopted crypto. It is international. There's just so much going for it. 
  
Why is raising in value? It is very transparent asset with limited supply that can be used as a currency. You could have said same about gold before paper money was invented. The only differnce is that you did not know how much gold was mined, how much gold will be mined in some period and what would be the total supply in future. With Bitcoin, all of this information is easily accessible. Paper money is just terrible, but I guess a necessary step between gold and bitcoin.
  
Sure it can't be currently used for small purchases, but this should soon change with LN implementation. Thanks to this, Bitcoin should be able to scale to size of Mastercard or Visa and beyond. I actually expect you won't be paying any fees, it would be merchants who would be using LN implementations who will pay fees for you. Same as merchant pay for each transaction you do with your Mastercard.

If he had just hodled for a few months, usd value of his btc would be more than double.  He bought in at 2700.
  
Worst part is that this was 2 months ago and his portfolio is probably worth even less now. My guess is 50-100btc.  
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:30:26
It is already too late. There are bots that scan reddit and archive every post. I'm pretty sure there are already people who figured out his name and are about to visit him.  
  
If I was him, I would immediately move to a different city/state with his entire family, get a fake ID, get a gun, change some bitcoin for money, relocate again, change name, leave country. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:39:23
Take your loss and invest back in BTC.  
  
You don't need to waste time researching coins that are pretty much always some worthless extension of bitcoin. Or perhaps far worse less competitive version of far superior thing that already exists real world.

I don't know, random guy posting on reddit that he suddenly found $40m worth of bitcoin. He isn't even asking some special question that could not be easily googled out.
  
This is either :  
  
1. A guy who isn't very clever and just revelead to pretty much entire internet that he's sitting on a good chunk of money that won't be that hard to steal. 
2. Just trolling for w/e reason.  
  
Either way, someone have already figured out his name/address and is about to initiate $5 wrench attack on his wallets(if they exist).
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:01:06
Have you ever done it yourself? I'm pretty sure this illegal since it can be classified as money laundering.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:55:22
but if it has no replay protection then you can't send it anywhere cause you lose your BTC in the process.
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:40:47
I would tend to agree, but there are just so many overvalued big name companies. One falls, others will follow.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:53:47
What if they can do it long enough to permanently damage BTC price, so majority of miners will be forced to mine B2X. This will cause some major exchanges to label B2X as Bitcoin and therefore pumping B2X price even more
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:38:53
So this means Bitcoin Gold and B2X are worthless, right?
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:40:43
Yeah thats also a possibility. But I'm worried that BTC + S2X will be less than BTC now.
@_date: 2017-10-11 12:18:35
Yeah I guess that is another reason.
However in some alternate reality where B2X suceeeds, they would have to hire at least some of former core developers anyways. These guys have several years of experience of bitcoin development. They are one of the main reason why bitcoin is successful and in such a great shape.
