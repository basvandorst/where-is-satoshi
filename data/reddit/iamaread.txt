Yes, it was not developed to be a database, it was developed to be a shared and trusted information registration. Similar to how Land Registries works. No one trying to develop a database as main goal (which DLT wasn't as I told) would design such inefficient. However if the goal is to have distributed ledgers and trust the design makes sense.
