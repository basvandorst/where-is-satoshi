I don't quite understand this but does this have the possibility of reducing the value of the 21M BTC limit - inflation via other blockchains?
Edit: Although I assume a LN port over to LTC from BTC means that if the LTC chain is attacked and breaks down when some funds are apportioned to LTC within the channel, then those funds will be vulnerable to any fallout, whereas the portion apportioned to BTC within the channel will still be fine - which means that there's still relative value keeping funds in the BTC LN due to its greater security, protecting its individuality and thus scarcity?
Bit of a mouthful but essentially I'm just making sure that funds aren't fungible between blockchains, because if they are then any number of blockchains (adding their monetary supply) to the network will result in the investment case for BTC to break down and lead to customers fleeing BTC + lack of incentive for miners to support the network

This is the infographic that actually changed my mind about the LN. Before I didn't see how you could link multiple entities without opening a channel with each one.

Reason I ask is that in the future if BTC transactions are $100 or $1000 or $10,000 each, most people won't want to pay it and if there's an easy way to purchase on an exchange, go into the LN network and never leave it for small transactions, then that will be very popular.
