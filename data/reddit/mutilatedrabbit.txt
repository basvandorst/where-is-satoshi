lmfao. Yeah, it's the "right thing to do." Of course. So when does it become the "right thing to do" to tell some government bureaucracy when I take a shit?
It's the right thing to do. Shit can be recycled for energy that sustains electricity for millions of US households. Here, I just wrote on this piece of paper that you are required to submit to me clear and thorough documentation every time you shit, so that I can come to your house and collect your excrement for recycling purposes. It's on the paper now and it's the right thing to do, so if you don't do it then we're going to have a *problem.*

So you know what's best for everybody. Well, problem solved. I guess we should just put in charge!

I doubt it. Only erudites like know what words mean. Thank God they've figured them out and are here to tell me what to do with my money.

What does "got in" mean? Oh, I guess you answered it in the second sentence. You've only "gotten in" if you've had more than $20k in transactions? What does that mean, though? $20k which way?

I have decided that I'm going to cut off one or both of your hands. Don't worry. I will place them into my magic energy box, and out of it will come new materials for building hands. We may even be able to replace both of your hands with near-identical replicas.
You're ok with this, I assume. Don't you benefit from it? You'll possibly get your hands back. In some form or another. And maybe even some other stuff, too!

Yes, taxes are theft. I don't need to justify anything about what I do or don't do with my property.
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:45:10
I think cuck is the appropriate terminology.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:22:25
The thievery doesn't come from the number. It comes from there being any number at all.
Show me your magic algorithm that determines the precise point "tax" turns into "thievery," and vice versa.
How did you come up with that algorithm? You really seem to have it all figured out. So I will re-iterate what I said in the last comment I posted: Problem solved, everyone! We can just put in charge. Everything will be perfect then! A true utopia at last!
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:11:53
No, theft is not fine.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:34:07
Oh, you're happy with how other people's money is spent.
Well, gee. Good for you. Hey, you wouldn't mind if I take a little bit from you too, right? I promise to spend it in the best ways!

How is that fair or understandable?

You know what's a pretty god-damned simple concept? The inherent social meaning behind why the grandparent poster used "/s."
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:46:55
wow, that's sad. I guess I should be worried then? what sort of recourse do we have?

so facebook is about to reach nirvana?

these people aren't too bright. you might not want to bother arguing on the internet at some point.

Overstock.com, NewEgg, TigerDirect (a little reluctantly; they have a good reputation but I've personally had mediocre experiences with them.)
edit: oh yeah.. Steam..
@_date: 2013-02-27 08:48:52
because talking to people is force. brilliant.

umm, no. you cannot prevent a DoS attack. by definition. you either have enough resources or you don't.
@_date: 2013-02-27 08:47:31
as ridiculous as this idea is, you're absolutely hilarious and even more ridiculous. jesus christ. I mean, I think way too much, but you're overanalyzing some random person on the internet's decision to take some mostly-harmless action and .. to what end? being incessant about proving your original comment was somehow correct? it's like.. what possible response could this guy make to get you to just shut up and move on?
