I'd like to see the facts. So does banks get charged for moving and holding cartel and other illegal money.  What about all other exchanges? If he did not flag transactions, maybe he had no knowledge. Last years 1000bucks is this year's 80000 bucks. So now does mtgox or coinbase have to report all those users since over 10k?  I mean if you invested 200 last jan you would now have more than 10k. Wow crazy to think

Why the drop-?
@_date: 2014-01-04 19:59:39
You dont think so? 70 billboards between LA group and SF group. Now back up to mod 800's and I predict next jump pver 1000 or even 2000+ sooner than folks think

Well as you can see godaddy did great without crossing lines. Not looking to turn it into xrated. Just a cute smile for marketing as well as showing and inviting other females into the crypto world.

Just a habit sorry tomuchfun. Just a habit as I see coins aw crypto stocks. Lol bitcoin alone has grown where most folks are buying shares of a coin to start. Not all of us can afford bulk or stacks of the coins.

Interesting how old is this?

Bitcoin will never be under  Dogecoin is simply getting attention due to word of mouth. Giving coins.etc.
Bitcoin has way less coins worth more. Less given away and still the top coin forever.  If 100billion coins worth 1 tenth of a cent more folks throwing away and giving away as nowhere to spend.
I started in bits less than a year ago...litecoin caught me when lowlow..
I learned of worldcoin before doge. Liked the name community and features.
Besides the three coins I own sex.junk.quark.and others for fun but bitcoin litecoin and world coin are my job and no doge or doggie or dodge will convince me otherwise.  Each new coin people jump on is a distraction from those golden few. There is near 200 coins. Only thing good about doge is the joke grew and no negative drug use or news..besides that id like to thank all crypto users for supporting the free world.
