I work for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America. We are a parts distribution company for corrugated machinery... selling the fastest finishing-end box machine in the world. 
We're located in Hunt Valley, MD and are constantly adding new vendors for machining purposes.
This is really awesome you guys have decided to accept bitcoin. I hope we move in that direction in the near future. We are definitely primitive with a lot of our technology, but we have made leaps in bounds in that regard quite recently.
I'm unsure of the size of your shop or your geographical range of customer-base, but shoot me a DM with your email and I'll send you some info from the office on Monday.

wow that's awesome... 
I bought in on the recent dip in april at about 65 a pop, I bought 7 of em. So I'd be very happy if they stabilize at the 120-130 range.
