Thanks for your comments Ilsensine.  I agree and I am sure there is more to this story.  As I get any new info I will post it here.  Trust me, I am just as interested as others may be about this.  My intent is not to smear, just tell the story as I understand it at this time.  I have an order on coinbase and everything worked great.  I had my account verified the long way but if I would have used the fast way I would have changed my password right afterwards.  My wife has given me credit for trying to get her to change hers after verification.

not instantly buy - instantly verify...the bank account.

So I found out my wife used her iPad to go through the verification process.  I do not know enough about computers to know if the iPad has a virus or other bad software.  Her history does not show anything unusual that I can see but it also does not show the detail of history a regular browser would.

I have only been a lurker for 2 or 3 months.  I created an account and posted here to tell the story as I understand it at this time - that's all.  I have only stated what happened to my wife - she will not forget this lesson any time soon.  I didn't come out swinging at coinbase - I tried to capture the scenario we went through last night.  My wife has been at her bank most of the day switching her accounts to a new ones and whatever else banks have you do when your account has been breached.  My wife does plan on writing a very nice letter to the bank manager of the WF in SF, giving her thanks and appreciation of the bank teller that spotted this happening, called my wife and called the police.

Generally speaking I did research coinbase.  I did see the news about the phishing site a week or so ago.  But I really didn't see much negative news except those people angry that coinbase canceled their order at the last minute. I had my bank account verified four days earlier but I used the longer more time consuming way (took 5 days) because my online banking was having issues.  But I would have changed my password after verification.

ok thanks for the clarification.  This account will be mine, not thrown away.  If I make other comments on future topics it will be from this account and username.
I don't think I made claims - didn't mean to.  I did say if this is not a coincidence the reality is a little troubling coming to terms with. That a breach exists either inside coinbase or outside of coinbase.  And all these things are a possibility. I tried to tell the events as they happened last night - and I ask questions of those with more experience than me.  But I'm sure most here would have changed their password after verification and would not be in the spot my wife is.

Thank you for the link, I had never seen this site before.

Yes I will look at her browser history tonight.  Pretty sure she did go to the real coinbase though - her bitcoins were still showing as pending on her account.  But I will try and verify tonight.

Correct the checks were a fraud.  The bank teller spotted the number sequence had a difference of 10 from my wife's actual account information - checks written.  The teller then saw that a large sum was withdrawn at a different location within 30 minutes or so.

Yes, I will post any update.  Just to clarify as of last night only the female was arrested at the bank.  The bank teller told us about the male(?) calling the bank pretending to be my wife and demanding release of the money.  I have no other information about the male or others at this time.

I am seldom right about much in my marriage but she has given me credit for trying to get her to change her password immediately after she was verified. I will note this...
@_date: 2013-11-27 02:29:40
No it is hers, we bought it new over a year ago.

Yes this is my first post, I really don't have a reputation for you to take into consideration.  I have been a lurker for only 2 or 3 months. It is not my intention to smear.  I have only provided what information I currently have.  My wife and I are new to bitcoins and coinbase.  All that I have written may in fact turn out to be a coincidence, which is why I framed that as a possibility. Regarding your comment about plaintext - I am not a computer expert, so I am assuming plaintext means not encrypted?  Regarding your comment about me using a real username - most if not all user names here don't appear to be real.  I mean, is someones name really dillpiclechips or brickfrog2?  Fine gentlemen I'm sure they are.  My username is a derivative of my last name.

Yes it definitely may be just a coincidence. To me it is odd though that these things come together in San Francisco??
