I agree with you. White Paper assumes you know a lot about computer science. This itself is turn off for many beginners that are not interested in learning the technical details. I hate it when people try to push "read bitcoin.pdf" to beginners. There is a chance most beginners won't understand it because it covers a very technical subject.

NO. There are no physical Bitcoins. There are only public ledgers, and miners solve the puzzle to add those transactions into a block, forming a block-chain

Andreas was not a bystander. His name was clearly listed on the LMB Holdings. I don't blame Andreas, but he is a big voice and needs to be careful on how he lends his name out.

This is great idea and I have been thinking about it for sometime too, but I think it is too early for something like this. Who will prosecute you and throw you in jail if you do not pay us ? It is a great idea, but just too risky.

To make sure you do not lie about your Bitcoins. The "mining" part of Bitcoin is the most innovative part of this software. The mining orders your transactions in the chain, so there is no disagreement on the network about if you spent your coins or not. 
Just spend few more days learning about how transactions work in the bitcoin network, and you will have all your answers

if I troll directory.io everyday, looking at each private address, what is the probability that I will end up with a private address with more than 10 BTC ? 
@_date: 2014-01-26 03:51:51
Hey, thanks for the video. I have actually watched that video before. So what I understand from the video is that  Private Key is actually any number that a user can choose, (in my case my Bitcoin client chooses for me) and the Elliptic Curve is only used to sign the message which then in turn generates a public key, which is then hashed into a Bitcoin Address.  Am I correct ? 
Also, how many digits (not bits, because i am nube) long does this Private Key (d) have to be in Bitcoin ? And how many digits long are those points in the curve (G) that is used to get the public key . Public key is also from what i understand is the point in the curve multiplied by the random number chosen by the software? 
And one final question is there any guidelines on how (d) is generated by the software ? 
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:49:02

You are a genius you have a problem that no one has ever thought of!
So let me be the first to answer you question, 
You need 51% of people people in the network to agree to the change. Just changing the source code wont do anything, you will need people actually downloading that client and using it. If government takes over than you simple don't use the stuff government puts out. Its really simple.

I never read so much of "volatility" anywhere. That seems to me is their main argument. If the Bitcoin market grows considerably then this "volatility" they talk about will simple disappear. Volatility is happening because the market is so small, and the one exchange (read: MT FUCKING GOX) has an ability to shake it. If we have more competing exchanges and more players in the market, shit like Gox will just be ignored. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 01:57:28
Why does NY Times problem such opinion ? This is completely inaccurate and guy does not know what he is talking about.

Here are two options for you : 
1) 
After you successfully create a offiline wallet you just send your bitcoins to your bicoin address, and use blockchain.info to look at your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:48:16
If they do that then they will loose business with some who won't do that. The technology is already there and implementing it is not hard. So if banks start charging minimal fee, than there will be other banks that won't charge that fee. It is very simple.

I guess it would be slow because of the time it would take for conformations ? I am sure if we collect a large enough BTC from the community, and hold it people will be motivated come up with something. I am sure some level of trust is required at some point, but it would be much better than Mt Gox and a regulated exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 17:16:18
Easycoin, 
One of the main reasons I bought Neo shares ($2K worth, which is a lot of money for me) was because Andreas was listed on the website of LMB holdings. He should have realized that his name carries a lot of influence and he should be careful how it is used.
I don't hold Andreas accountable completely of what happened but we also cannot call him innocent bystander. Andreas was responsible for promoting Neo-Bee and because he had his name on the website many people bought Neo's shares and lost money. That is the fact and no matter how you try to defend it, it won't work.

I personally support Coinbase and I think they are a great site, however, if you want to create a paper wallet, I think the best way to do it would be to do it completely offline, not online.

@_date: 2014-03-08 22:21:00
Nope. And it sucks most people think of it like that. I believe Bitcoin and I also think it needs little regulation to flourish. Maybe you need to understand that, Bitcoin is not an ideology, its money. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:19:19
it makes perfect sense. 
The only question I had was the timing of the broadcast. Say in client - server model, since every client is connected to a centralized server, if something is "solved" anybody that is connected to that server would know it instantly, so it would become a race on how quickly someone can find out the solution to that problem. So basically the closer you are to the server, the faster you can act on solving another problem because the closer you are to the server the faster you would find out that the problem was "solved"
So on P2P perspective, (which i do not completely understand, hence the question), how does this kind of information broadcasting happen ? So as soon as A solves a block, every one (B, C, D and E) will instantly find out about the solution, even if one is located in Australia and the other in United States ? 
Sue-dough-nim did mention that blocks are tiny so I guess that makes the time very negligible to even worry about. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:14:19
You make no sense! Do your research and if you own any Bitcoins sell them, because you don't deserve them!

hashcash was invented for emails but we use it for Bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2014-02-08 05:09:57
- It does reach 21 million. The rewards will just stop and miners will most likely just work for the transaction fees. 
- 51% attack basically means you have enough hashing power to build your own chain with blocks. If the rest of 49% think something is funny is going on, (which they probably will find out really fast), they can just ignore the chain that is controlled by the 51% and move on. 
I have been learning about bitcoin for few months now, and I still do not completely understand it, so don't worry about asking questions. Go here to learn more about Bitcoin 
 and use google :) 
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:38:14

ad19, 
Every node isn't connected to every single other node. But that's basically how it works.
I do not know what you man by that, can you please explain it clearly ? The way I think of P2P is as not having a centralized server, but how are clients actually connected to each other ? 
@_date: 2014-03-06 05:21:41

It would be really dumb for Cyprus to not jump on this opportunity. Opportunities like this don't last forever, and eventually countries will come around accepting Bitcoin. I think people still have a hard time understanding that no one can stop Bitcoin.(of course people also tend to think everything needs a face)
Also, in few years I am sure major tax heavens are going to transition towards BTC. The technology is already there, and you really don't  need a lot of infrastructure to facilitate such a transition. So, even a second world country can be a hub for BTC. 
All these articles about Dorian and Mt Gox is only spreading Bitcoin, and sooner or later countries like Switzerland, or places like Cayman Islands will surely adopt it. 
So just like the early adopters of Bitcoin Cyprus needs to understand its potential and act!

Very Short Answer. There it is below, Change It!

    {
    int64_t nSubsidy = 50 * COIN;
    // Subsidy is cut in half every 210,000 blocks which will occur approximately every 4 years.
    nSubsidy &gt;&gt;= (nHeight / Params().SubsidyHalvingInterval());
    return nSubsidy + nFees;
    }
