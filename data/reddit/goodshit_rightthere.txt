Time to refill !
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:40:48
I'm in
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:35:46
Alright, if I get it I'll post a message here to prove if you're trustworthy or not.

The Chinese population is considerably less educated, wealthy and tech-conscious than Europeans and Americans. Since when is the number of inhabitants of a country the only data to factor in such matters?

Hey, you mind telling me what this "bitcoin cash" thing is all about? I really don't know what it is, and how it relates to Aug 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:06:04
Yeah, I bought 0.0428 btc. Very excited but also kinda worried about those 144€ disappearing from my account haha. I then transferred the btc to my Exodus wallet; do you have any idea how much time it will take to appear in Exodus ?
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:33:22
Have you still made a lot of money by trading though ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:09:59
Wow you've actually lived on bitcoin.. Nice.
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:10:28
Bought for 140$ yesterday, I figured if I don't do it now I will never do it.

You could take a look at Ripple and Ethereum. It has good potential - I can't invest more at the moment but if I could, I would drop another 100$ in Ripple and Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:30:22
Wow. That honestly sounds like a scam haha
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:14:29
Ubiq could be big. Look into it
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:11:27
like 30$ a week for 10 weeks ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:00:02
thanks for the honest answer
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:09:40
ELI5 what's happening in here ?
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:43:57
It's a constant moral dilemma really. The more we go forward the less our investment is likely to explode.
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:10:38
Yeah you know what, I just set up my Exodus wallet and Kraken account. I'll wait for Kraken to verify me and then I'll buy for 50$. I'll wait a week and buy another 50$ and so on.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:21:52
I bought at ~2900$ fml haha, it will get back up though
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:27:11
What do you mean by the fee ? I'm French so I don't know what fee you're referring too. I bought 0.0428 btc at around 2630€ (2970$) and transferred it right away to Exodus
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:07:36
I can afford to lose 300$. It would be a pain for a few days, but I wouldn't mind too much; if I don't do it, I'll regret it sooner or later.
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:04:07
I bought 0.0428 btc. I'll stop there and won't buy anything else until August.
@_date: 2017-06-23 13:56:18
Well that's a 100% ROI, which is absolutely great. :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:23:16
Shiii. Do you still have btc from the time you bought at $14 ?
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:05:59
ELI5 UASF/BIP148 please guys ?
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:24:16
$2705 right now.. that absolute minimum has to be reduced
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:35:59
Wow, thanks so much for the resource. :)
@_date: 2017-06-07 11:39:44
Do you think Bitcoin could go up to 50000$ in the future ?
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:54:24
Wow, thanks. Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:57:29
Thanks for the answer. So, there's basically no way for a student with a GTX 1070 to mine enough bitcoin to get some profit ?
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:39:05
My portfolio is 19% bitcoin. I'm not trolling, I'm just looking for an efficient way to buy more bitcoin because of the current dip.
