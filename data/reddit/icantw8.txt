Well right now I can work full time but I fluctuate between full-time and part time since I also go to school and pay tuition so I can't invest all of the money I earn, which would be crazy. Tuition isn't much but I don't like risking everything incase if an emergency happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:22:32
I had enough to buy a whole bitcoin but decided to allocate just half of it incase it crashes. I'm 26 with a full time job and I don't have many expenses besides paying partial rent for living with my mom and car insurance.

This market makes me cringe.

$6000 is roughly the average cost of mining 1 bitcoin in many countries. Maybe that has something to do with it.
@_date: 2018-09-09 00:32:13
It went from $1350 to less than $200....What a crash.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:25:50

Uhh Bitcoin, you had one job.

For my birthday wish...I wish for BTCs to moon by the end of this year.
Naw I'm kidding. I'm just happy to have Bitcoins in the world.

Kinda pathetic how that's your only argument. You must of said the same thing to school teachers whenever they made a mistake on their lectures huh.

Let me guess, you must be one of those dumbos who says that "dumps are good for bitcoin" yes?

And he chose...poorly. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:16:58
No different than going all in on Bitcoins either. This market is purely driven by speculation, no matter what vehicle you take. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 10:40:05


Pretty much what I'm doing. 9 months isn't really a long time. Bear markets typically last from 15 to 20 months and longer. Wouldn't be surprised to see prices fall to $4k levels.
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:09:42
Let the HODLing begin. 
@_date: 2018-08-27 04:40:42


My prediction is that Bitcoins will be worth less than $10k by the end of 2018. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:03:51
BTC, I trust.
HODL, I must.

To HODL or not to HODL, that is the question.
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:17:42
Not gonna lie, I'm so disgusted with this market that I really don't want to take part in it anymore even though I could and odds seem favorable in my end. Idk. I'm seriously pissed off about my losses but I'm more pissed off for giving in to my lowest instincts and buying when I shouldn't have. 
3 digit bitcoin wasn't even that long ago. For now, I think I'll just wait it out until the fucking bears finish the job already. If it does rebound and things go the way they have been before fucking 2018 started then so be it.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:43:01
I believe the hype is gone at this point. Pretty much everyone knows about BTCs and how to buy them. The recent dip that's been happening could be the result of just that; people buy into the hype, then hope of striking it rich quick and once that's gone, they move on and never come back. This could be the beginning of the end for Bitcoin and probably all of cryptocurrency. 
Bitcoin has been around 2009 - almost ten years. Even today, it's hardly been utilized and only a handful are actively using cryptocurrencies for its purpose. The concept is good, but too complex for the majority to understand, which is why cryptocurrencies will likely never replace the flexibility and simplicity of fiat money. Why replace something that already works? Ten years is a very long time, yet it hasn't affected the popularity of fiat money in most parts of the world. This is a big indication that cryptocurrencies are not all that cracked up to be. 
Anyone can make a news article and claim that "experts believe Bitcoins will reach an x amount of money by this time" but in reality, nobody knows. I certainly don't think bitcoins will reach a tremendous amount of money anytime soon. 10 more years from now, I could see Bitcoins still being around 4 digits since there's a lot of them in circulation and I don't think it will gain in much popularity being that it's hardly easy to understand how it works.
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:07:13
I predict that it will more likely hit around $2-3k at this point. Like you, I can just feel it happening. Unlike your prediction however, mine actually has merit; just look at coinmarketcap and you'll see that almost every crypto in the market has continuously fell in value for months now. This could actually be the beginning of the big dip for all we know. Couple months isn't really a long time.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:47:29
I bought only .25 of a bitcoin when I could've easily bought a whole coin with how much I've saved but my stupid hunch told me to buy a fraction since it might go down again, even when the coin hit rock bottom. I KNEW it was gonna go up but my stupid hunch kept holding me back which is why I bought so little when I could've bought more. 
Needless to say, I'm my own worst enemy. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:49:03
Then can you explain why Base Set Pokemon booster packs (the one that came out in 1999) are selling for 10x the MSRP?
It's a niche market, not a lot of them are in circulation, doesn't serve much purpose other than being a collectible good, and for some reason, people want one. It seems to fits the BTC scenario.
@_date: 2018-07-22 10:16:34
Can't read the text but damn, looks sick. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 12:46:00
Seems like the bear market now lasted as long as the bull market back in 2017. Could this be the turnover?

*yawn* Is there someone else who can dish out a more offensive comment than this junk?
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:19:50
Because when every coin is crashing down at 70% below the ATH, then its a sign that the whole market is pretty much gone up in smoke. Back when this happened 3-4 years ago, bitcoins weren't worth a lot of money - which is why it had stabilized for so long and then went up when more and more investors took advantage of the opportunity to hoard many coins to dump at the right time. Those investors are long gone. Never coming back. Bitcoins will probably never see the light of the $20k price tag again. Sorry but it will take a long time for bitcoins to rebound to even half of where it was before. If you really care about your money, I would NOT buy anymore bitcoins but rather keep the ones you have and hope to recoup as much loss as you can before the inevitable happens. That's what I'm gonna do; not hold on to the coins like an idiot when the opportunity to sell shows up again like it did when it reached almost $12k in Feb.
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:17:49
It's only a matter of time before Bitcoins hit the gutter. The graph says it all. 4 months and the price has slid down one dip after another, a clear indication that the price is only going to lower at this point. No person with the right mind would think that buying bitcoins after crashing down hard *even* at 67% below the ATH is a good idea. How long has it been since Bitcoins were around? Pretty much forever at this point. So why are people STILL losing hope in a system that many people *think*, will dominate the world? Please PLEASE tell me I'm not crazy for thinking this. 
I am going to pass on the opportunity to buy and will steer clear for the sake of common sense - which is unfortunately a dying trait nowadays. No amount of reasoning will lead me to the surge of upvotes in this circlejerk sub although I am confident that I will be ultimately be right about this which is why I am taking my sweet time before bed to post this message and be able to look back with pride when the time comes. 
If not, then sweet. I will relish the second chance to sell what's left of my bitcoin stash before I make the same mistake twice - yes you heard me, I am an official bitcoin owner who's NOT too optimistic about the future of bitcoin. I'll be happy to risk what's left of my portfolio and hope that I'm wrong over blindly believing that this predicament is going to change for the better. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:21:27
$4k is too high. I can see it reaching for 3 digits pretty soon. Graphs don't lie after all.

@_date: 2018-04-09 11:07:12
Bitcoins doing it does best in 2018: Drop in value. 
3 digits, here we come. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:01:15
I wouldn't bet if it were like that because it would just be based on sheer luck cause the price flunctuates regardless if the market is failing or not.
But I would say it will reach 7500 or more before crashing back down below 6000
@_date: 2018-04-08 05:11:51
It's off cause I don't think this forum condones gambling and I don't think the price will drop that low within the next few hours; I already said that the price will probably go up like two times because the price fluctuates so quickly and my hunch think it's due for another increase in price anyways.
I am only convinced that the price will be lower than the price right at this moment 7 days later. Not going to bet on it anymore but if I had to hypothetically, I would bet at most $50.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:27:29
"Buy now or cry later."
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:30:48
Down. It's gonna happen. Watch and learn.
(I would bet $50 if this was official. Easiest $50 I would ever make in my life.)
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:46:48
You're just throwing away money at this point. I have like $1000 (or less) just itching to be spent on a worthwhile investment and I don't really see much hope for making any return on cryptos cause I can think critically. If you take a look at the graph right now, you can see that we've already reached the point of no return so if you're just blindly going to believe that spending dip after dip after dip after dip is going to do any service to you, then you should think again for your sake. Do what you want to though. Your loss is certainly not my loss anyways. Lmfao. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:48:38
I said before that the price fluctuates too quickly to make it a convincing bet, which is why I am more confident in waiting 7 days to see the result. It may be 7100 now and it may even reach 7500 very soon but I think that this is only temporary and the price will continue to decline in the coming days since it's been like this for months. I don't want to bet on something that takes only luck to find out.
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:18:44
Gotta love the double standards here. 
"BTC IS SHOOTING TO THE MOON. FASTEN YOUR SEATBELTS!" - not a FUD
"I think this might be the time BTC will hit rock bottom and will likely stay there due to the huge loss of interest in buyers." -FUD
@_date: 2018-04-30 01:11:07
I had my BoA account since 2008. I started to link payments to buy more than 5 different cryptos last year. No warnings or issues yet.
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:46:06
 ~20% or more change in price within the next 7 days of this post? idk.
@_date: 2018-04-08 04:50:22
There likely won't be much change within the next few hours. I think 7 days is pretty convincing when you look at how stable it's been lately. 
I am convinced however, that the price will be lower than now in the next 7 days. Will it go up a few times before then? Probably yes.
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:22:06
Nov 2013 peaked at around $1k USD. 2017 began at $1k USD. That's 3 years.
@_date: 2018-12-11 03:23:42
According to this, BTC can drop well below $1000. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:40:08
It'll crash back to pre-2014 prices soon. What's the point of HODLing anymore.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:38:57
Wow nice guess cause that's me right now.

Not for like another several months if not a year or more because of how much this market stinks.

@_date: 2018-12-08 00:10:38
I think I'll wait another 12 months. If not 24. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:37:53
Lmfao no.
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:29:26
But it didn't grow in value from where it started. That's the problem. 
BTC could theoretically dip from 3.3k now to below 1k and then rise to 3.3k again 15 months later. Since the ATH is about 19x higher, it's a high probability that it could take *much* longer.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:37:03
I care.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:30:33
This proves nothing. BTC can still dip well below $1000 which will send it back to prices before 2014. % below ATH will still be similar to that of June-November 2011.
We may not even be at the lowest price yet or even close.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:23:56
The average bear market lasts from 15-20 months. The last time BTC had a dramatic crash like this lasted more than 3 years. 
Your point?
@_date: 2018-12-01 12:33:31
Guessing it'll be what it is today which is around ~$4000.
