For god's sake man, I'm an artist not a core dev!

Are you fucking kidding? You weren't around two or three years ago when you had to pay cash over a red telephone at a drug store. And then hope to god you're money showed up in some account where you then transferred that money to Mtgox only to have Mtgox collapse.

Stating how many bitcoins you own is the new dick measuring contest, methinks. 
@_date: 2016-01-19 05:26:54
Good question baby, except that how do you know that I don't contribute? Do you know me personally? I contribute, but in other ways... Do I have to be a core dev to be a supporter of bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-01-02 22:04:23
Bitcoin needs good PR, marketing, lobbying, advertising, the works to help with the public perception.

Do you own a supercomputer? (Y) or (N)
@_date: 2016-01-02 20:32:37
No doubt it'd cost millions, but come on! The pay off could be huge. Bitcoin is revolutionary. And if shit like pedeggs and catheters can have commercials so should Bitcoin.

[ I've been using it for over a year now. Nice design, easy to bet.

Oh how I was hoping to find a pile of rubble signifying Mtgox in the exchanges section.

Question: How does OpenBazaar make money then if it's free? Will they add fees eventually?
@_date: 2016-01-04 05:40:22
The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago. Second best time is today. 
@_date: 2016-01-08 17:48:15
Bravo by the way!! As a designer/artist myself I can tell you put some time into it. I give it two thumbs up!

Can we also add Paul Big Vern's name to the list now?

I kinda think the opposite. This rally has occurred under his term. Do you think there's a correlation? I didn't vote for him or anything but I am enjoying these gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:04:45
I got what you're saying. But hear me out...unpopular opinion incoming...What about putting pressure on Coinbase and GDAX? Big Brother type of pressure? Or outright forcing them to close? Don't say it won't happen. Because it could. People also said Trump would never become president. And he did. Expect the unexpected when it comes to things like this. I'm not trying to spread FUD I'm just trying to think rationally and not be clouded by circlejerking.

If Changetip was still around we could tip him a couple of bits!
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:38:03
Good info. Thanks for the insight.
