so... at the moment, antminer s9 (13.5 th/s) @ $5000 each, would need 1,555,556 s9 units (which do not exist of course) costing $7,777,780,000 - something like that.    1400watts each unit...
doing some math here... how long would that take to pay off... hmmm... math math, how long does an eviction take?  math math.  i'm all in!  i just need to finish this hydroelectric dam.  when i finish the 2nd dam i'll start upgrading the armory and then here come the tanks.

and since i'm here...  where is the mistake i'm making when trying to figure out how long it would take to pay for itself if I bought a 4.5Ghash box ($150)?       
using a bitcoin calculator, it shows that it pays for itself in close to 1 week (that is if you were to get it right now, today)
i realize there are difficulty changes, but the box still pays for itself in a week if you enter the next predicted difficulty value.

months ago i was looking at a BFL jalapeno. i had asked a few questions about how much diff. increases were, because i was having trouble figuring out why these machines were not just 'free money' - so while my calculations showed that you could pay for your Jalapeno in ONE WEEK at that current difficulty and price - i was assured the difficulty increases would change those numbers very quickly.  and they DID!   but the opposite is occurring due to the value of the coin. 
here's a little chart @ 4.5Ghash
2/26 D=3651011 returns $587 a month (18 coins a month)
3/02 D=4367876 returns $633 a month (as the bitcoin reached $40)
3/27 D=6695826 returns $912 a month 
4/07 D=7672999 returns $1418 a month ( per coin and 9 coins a month)

3/02 4.5Ghash/sec = $132 per week  @ 4367876 
3/19 4.5Ghash/sec = $180 per week  @ 4847647 (where BTC = $55 right now)
