When will be BFX be opening the books so we can see exactly how you arrived at the numbers you did and we verify all users including the company's reserves and it's employees were treated equally?
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:55:04
I sent a balance to the exchange 90 minutes before you guys shut it down. My deposit never showed up and your support said you were experiencing problems. You asked me send you a pm since the deposit still isn't in my account. I've sent two already. Do I need to just open another ticket?
What was the cutoff for deposits on the haircut?
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:08:48
Thought the BFX token were worth $1? I see mine worth $.20?
@_date: 2016-08-14 01:55:07
Haha just another redditor. I was making light of all the times Zane replied to really important questions with "more details to come."
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:52:29
You do realize how retarded this bfx token garbage is? Your exchange is going to be empty as soon as withdrawals are opened and where are those profits going to come from to pay us all back? And if you think you're going to enable trading first and keep our funds hostage you're going to be in even deeper shit with the community.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:29:40
Since you just made us all shareholders we deserve to know everything and now.
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:06:04
It takes 30 mins at least for bfx to credit your account.
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:06:58
Because they are worthless as it stands. This is part of the scam. BFX's current debt obligation is now only 30% what it was before opening trading.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:06:07
Legally, no you're probably not going to have any liability for the bitcoin that were stolen but if we can stop with the bs for a minute we both know every last person that had BTC on the exchange trusted you to not lose them and ethically and morally you absolutely should replace every single one. It's unfortunate that ethics and morals are no longer part of doing business nowadays though. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:13:59
We need you to address why these have any value, when they'll be paid back and how they'll be paid back. You're talking about opening trading soon and you haven't even addressed this yet. Any one of us can draw a picture of George Washington on an napkin and call it a dollar bill but that doesn't make it so.
@_date: 2016-08-12 23:10:26
We'll be providing details in the coming days.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:57:24
How was this the right way? BTC was stolen and everyone got screwed. Its the right way if you held btc because you don't care about the other account holders being robbed to compensate your loss.
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:32:33
Then what good are they to US residents?
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:48:52
US residents = bag holders once the exchange goes live -
everyone else = sell as soon as you can
@_date: 2016-08-20 08:54:49
Oh look more legal advice from bitcoiners on Reddit. This is new and interesting. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:42:19
What is the reason? I'll hold my breath while you reply.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:00:15
My sentiment exactly.
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:55:52
HI Zane looks like my deposit was properly credited. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:56:18
So once the coin goes live we can definitely assume it's doing to be sold off at least in the beginning. How does this help compensate users in the US  and not turn them into bag holders? Why is there a different standard at all?
Furthermore why do you think this coin has any value at all?
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:37:36
And when everyone withdraws their money from the exchange where are those profits coming from? I'll sell you a worthless pos made up coin in my company too if you like.
@_date: 2016-08-09 11:32:59
The CEO should be making statements not Zane.
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:50:35
How are you going to be opening trading when you have given us zero information about this BFX token? We have no idea why BFX thinks it's worth $1. This question has been asked many times and has not gotten an answer.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:32:04
paging @_date: 2016-08-20 16:36:41
Not sure if those precious metals websites that take btc ask for ID but that's a route you can check out. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 11:50:33
I'd just really love access to my ether, Zane. It's really not cool to hold everyone hostage if only BTC was affected.
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:17:13
knowledge is power!
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:56:47
Wouldn't it be prudent to release all details before these are allowed to trade? As it stands they have zero value.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:40:12
If you asked me to hold your bitcoin and I called you and said sorry bro its gone you'd say, "You lost MY bitcoin!?" or you'd say "Oh, no worries it was your bitcoin anyway."
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:46:45
Could you please answer some of the more relevant questions in this thread or perhaps send someone here who can?
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:22:06
Not to mention all the fees they're making off the trades. $20 says next week or sometime soon they'll release some information solidifying their worth to keep the lawyers at bay but thats after they've been able to buy them for pennies on the dollar. I put a sell order in for $1.25 I'm in no rush and who knows the gamblers trading it right now will probably push it over $1.
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:22:35
Why are US users unable to margin trade? What changed?
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:14:36
And you didn't see this happening? I find it very irresponsible to not release all the details of the token PRIOR to allowing it to be traded. As it stands its nothing more than IOU that will be paid back whenever BFX gets around to it.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:21:03
So you gave us something even more worthless? You guys really astonish me.
