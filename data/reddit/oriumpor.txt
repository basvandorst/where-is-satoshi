My wife watched the press conference with me and we both had the same realization at the same moment.  The look on his face, the lack of any real emotion, that slight grin he's trying to hide.  
He knows where they are.

What better way to lie than to self medicate?

Not really defending either here.  Its more that doge isn't what dickwad bitcoin bashers are.  The trolls just latch on to doge because they know it riles the folks here. The majority of the dogecoin community aren't represented by the vocal ass hats that seem to pop up here.
I mined my share of bitcoins before the FPGA had its day. I believe in the 'coin and so do the great majority of shibes.  We don't want the cryptocurency community to see these folks and think they represent a majority of us.

Let's say I buy coin every day.  And I use it as part of my daily purchases.
Since I'm taxed at the 'sale' of the currency, why wouldn't I simply only 'sell' the coins that are technically at a loss that moment and hold those that would net me a profit?
I know that's not how the typical transaction works but you could theoretically separate it all price/wallet and do just that.  Always holding what would net a gain and selling what nets a loss.
You'll end up holding coin that is an 'investment' and selling coin as a loss.
Follow it up with a net loss when you do cash out and tadaa cap gains in your favor.  The volatility of bitcoin could work in your favor.

It's the maximum loss you could deduct per anum re:cap gains.  If for instance you were operating at a 1% loss to expenses, (Really inefficient mining gear, that took 101% of the cost of the coin it generated in operating expenses)  the question is could you write off the coins.  Since you wouldn't actually be generating a profit.  It's no way to operate long term, but you could essentially convert income from one medium to the other and be subsidized for your inefficiency.

It hit 7 bucks or so the first few days on the exchanges ;) ~$2 a vert seems reasonable though.

It's really too bad that the bitcoin community has had this experience. The dogecoin community is much like all reddit communities: self deprecating and pretends to dislike the previous generation while still maintaining a connection to them.
Doge is less that 4 months old.  Bitcoin is not much more than 10 times that age.  Doge was made as a joke and spiraled into a micro transaction currency.  Bitcoin's transaction fee schedule and distribution make it a great mechanism for larger transactions and have made it a vehicle for speculation and exchanging other currencies.  Its almost bearer paper. If you have 1 bitcoin and you want fiat it is trivial to do so.  
It's still used as a currency but its taken the place of the virtual USD (easy to convert in forex between other currencies.)
Doge is great for giving small (real) values due to the unit:value  ratio and lower transaction fees.. I've made transactions in btc for years but the hammy, reddit attitude of dogecoin is not to be dismissed. For just as bitcoin is acknowledged by all as *the* virtual currency, a mention of the light hearted doge is near always followed by good press for the mighty BTC.

This is the last group of folks that should be in dispute.  One can only benefit the  other.
I can tell you your mods are much kinder than the dogecoin mods.  I tend to see those sorts of posts about btc get deleted or downvoted off the page.

hugolp might be right, he might be on mood stabilizers or anti-anxiety meds.
