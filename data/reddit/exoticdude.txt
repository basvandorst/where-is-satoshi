Thanks for the detailed explanation. I definitely need to learn a lot and your post clarifies some doubts I had. I will check out the suggestions by you and try to implement for safe-bitcoining..

That's a neat site with synopsis information about Bitcoins.. Thanks.. Will recommend the same to others if they ask me.. :)

Nice. Someone in one of the comments mentioned using Ubuntu / Linux for more security. Your post explains it step by step.

Thanks. Will try to be responsible and read more to understand better..
Nice quote from Spiderman - With great power comes great responsibility..
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:41:49
Will look into that. Thanks for the suggestion..

Thanks for the tip This will definitely help me expand my usage of Bitcoins and in the future I will glide some Bitcoins as tips to other users.. 
Oh I did enable the 2-factor authentication process. Thanks for the suggestion.

Just enabled multisig vault.. Thanks for the suggestion..

Thanks for the suggestion I will read more about paper wallets.. I will definitely use them when I decide to invest way more in Bitcoins someday (100 bitcoins or more)..
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:03:54
Yup, will try to be cautious. I am not a tech savvy guy, but I can manage money a bit. Let's hope everyone make safe financial decisions..

Having fun was the main reason I joined and decided to invest something in Bitcoin.. :) I used to be an outside spectator and read all about it. All the information about Bitcoin is overwhelming sometimes to a newbie..
Thanks for the suggestion and advice. I will watch that video and many others and try to learn from other users..
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:55:00
Thanks for your suggestion and tip I will check them out. There are so many options available for Bitcoin community and the choice is left for the Bitcoin user. No regulation + Too many choices make the Bitcoin still riskier investment.. I hope this gets fixed and gets centralized / easier in someway..
Also I need to learn about the gliding instructions used by changetip.. I saw 1 coffee, high five, congratulations among many today.. Fascinating how each has some pre-set bits assigned which makes gliding fun and easy!

Looks really exciting. You should advertise this more. By reading your description of its features, it sounds secure.
Fortunately or unfortunately, I am not an iPhone / any apple product user. As of now, using Android and am happy. No hard feeling and hoping not to get into an argument between Apple vs Android.. :)
You should definitely promote this in Bitcoin community, especially for iOS / iPhone users. And build one for Android platform..

Thanks. Good link for shopping with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:32:26
Thanks for the tip I too used Google to read some basics and noticed that there are many many options available. Hence I thought I will ask what the pros at do and to guide me in the right direction..
I came across some links while reading. I wasn't sure if your questions were directed at me or the larger bitcoin users commenting on the thread.. Anyways I am posting them, read them if you have time.. I have saved them for future read.
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:24:48
Thanks. Will check them out.
@_date: 2014-11-05 22:35:16
I will definitely check them out. Thank you. I was skeptical of opening my wallet and vault with providers outside my country of residence (USA).. So I didn't explore others and opened mine at Coinbase.. After the MtGox debacle and bankruptcy, you can imagine internet people from other countries will have very less jurisdiction for any case / lawsuit against them.. This is just my thought process and I might be wrong..
@_date: 2014-11-05 23:47:58
Will do. Thanks for the suggestion and links. Just enabled multisig vault..

That's what scares me..:) Everyone suggests to be extra protective. But I would assume since so many people are exchanging / buying / selling with more that 1 million (guessing) Bitcoin users, these security features must be protected / encrypted enough to be secure. I guess everyone needs to be careful and play cautiously with Bitcoins. Until someone gives assurance for the value for money (which I hope so will happen in the future by all respective central governments), the user skepticism about Bitcoins will persist. I hope I don't lose hard-earned money due to security lapses like MtGox!
Thanks for the links. I did read about local Bitcoin markets - Not sure how safe / reliable they are. Will check them out.. Yes I am from States and since Coinbase is based in US, I thought it would be a good bet to open account with them.

Good suggestion. Will try not to..
