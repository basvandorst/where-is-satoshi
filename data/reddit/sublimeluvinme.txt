How do you make money in this plan? No fees? There's no such thing as a free lunch.

You are a saint.

Silk road for a start, if your into that kind of nefaratious activity.

Trade some greenbacks for BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:00:45
I used bitfloor for my first transaction when they were at ~$75 two weeks ago. Their price was a little higher than Mt. Gox, but I had my btc in minutes. It worked out well for me given what the price is now.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:00:55
But it certainly wont be one of most expensive purchases a person makes.
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:02:33
Convert grannys next check to btc. Its not like you werent gonna blow it on pot anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:00:59
I really really hope this is true for the poor guys sake.

Take one can to the recycling depot. Take the pennies you earn and put an order with bitfloor. Congrats, you now have bitcoins.

But also, have you checked the exhanges today? Theyre all at 105...
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:30:28
Why don't you go build one yourself you ungrateful twat. I've been using this wallet for a while, and it's great for keeping small amounts of btc.

They should become less shitty first.

a haiku:      
standard markets crash     
like a bird hits a window      
have faith in bitcoin        
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:41:16
That would be so bizzare

I have well over 200 spins (400, in fact) and I think my alias is my reddit tag. But don't bother funding it because that game is a massive waste of money.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:41:41
Long term it wouldnt be wise. If you want to play day trader, good luck.

There once was a shitty ass poet      
Who tried real hard to not show it         
But his weakness shined through       
'cause he wrote in haiku       
The downvotes now show that he knows it
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:47:56
NO ONE KNOWS WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE VALUE OF BITCOINS SO STOP ASKING.
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:27:22
Not in the past 24 hours, but if mt. Gox is down im thinking of doing it later. They were super quick the first time i used them.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:07:26
Honestly, consider yourself blessed. BoA is insidious.
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:43:13
Thanks 
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:02:15
You are stupid for paying money for a dog. There are plenty in shelters just as loving and just as deserving of homes. Instead you chose to blow your money for really no reason at all.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:06:09
Bitfloor and BST

I'd like to try this bitcoin thing.

I would love one in @_date: 2013-04-09 23:24:44
If you have any of your wealth invested in btc, just ask yourself, would I be willing to trade my bitcoin for the equal value of some other cryptocurrency? The consensus (I would imagine) is a definite no. Nothing stops another currency will be created, but i doubt any will take off.
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:11:50
this. Unless you know what the fuck you are doing (and who really does?) playing daytrader is a sure-fire way to lose your loot.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:03:58
Do you have permission from the bots owner to do this?
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:59:10
Because it is a currency and not an investment vehicle. Early adopters will profit IF it becomes a more mainstream and less volatile but if everyone hoards it, you will see its value shrink.

If the entire internet is forever destroyed, we would have a lot more to worry about than btc.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:26:38
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:35:09
They are usually higher than mt. Gox, but the process is very simple. Anonymous cash deposit at any BoA, and in minutes your account is funded.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:36:00
Im not saying its illegal, its pointless.
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:12:54
I just used it about an hour ago. I had bitcoins within 30 mins of the cash deposit. They are pricier than mt. Gox, but convenient.
@_date: 2013-03-28 05:20:07
You are as saint @_date: 2013-04-12 17:03:42
Damn dude, I've just seen the tip but it's quite large.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:59:19
You are entitled to your opinion and I'm entitled to mine. Your notions about shelter dogs are jaded and incorrect, but you seem like a combative doucher who I have no interest in engaging in dialogue with. Good day sir.
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:02:42
You're an attention whore? Congratulations!
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:49:11
Imho, it's a pipe dream. But its certainly fun to think about.

This is one of the biggest flaws to btc IMO. Traditional currencies have very low barriers to entry, but to use btc you have to jump through 8 hoops and have the tech to support and understand it.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:50:52
Very good point. Right now my investment isnt significant enough to cause me to freak if the price tumbles, so my coins will stay in my own wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-22 03:13:23
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:11:28
Bitfloor is quick and easy, but a little pricey. BST also great, but I haven't personally used them. Mt. Gox is the largest exchange, but it can take days to fund your account.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:16:09
If your ''brother'' wants to not get ''screwed'' out of his ''money,'' then he should use his ''bitcoins'' to ''buy'' something as soon as he gets them. It is a ''currency'' after all.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:09:43
Cool! If I used twitter I would follow you.
