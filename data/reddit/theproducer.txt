Will this ever get confirmed?

They're a market maker. Would this have any correlation to liquidity? High supply, low demand?

Bitcoin doesn't, but the layers on top of the protocol could be a different story.
e.g. You can't patent milk but you could patent a way to preserve it.

Interesting the current BTC/USD spot price is $602. Coinbase price is around $650USD.

I just tried to buy BTC. Set up an account, took about 6-7 minutes. Went back after the account was verified and couldn't buy any. Some issue with the machine :(

But I can use that shovel for a lot more things than digging for gold.

No, Australian based company to fund bitcoin businesses anywhere worldwide.

Great to hear it was successful. Is there something similar planned for Melbourne?

Does anybody find it odd asking people to "donate" their patents? 
Why would someone who pays for and goes though the process of a patent want to donate it? And if the patent holder had the same goal as this company (free use for all), wouldn't "patent donations" be redundant? Considering its ultimately the patent holders responsibility to pursue litigation if someone else uses it without their permission.

Unless you're a farm and somehow ahead of the curve.

My start-up, PayMeDC.com is working on having less points of failure and only one party (the merchant) with  technology/hardware. Making the user technology free. 
We're also doing a pitch at Melbourne's first Bitcoin conference. A prototype terminal will be there to check out.

It's sad that he cannot live out his life as he had wished. I respect the fact Satoshi cares not for the money but to spend his time with family and friends. Thank you.

I upvoted twice. But it was really only once.

This company wants regulation by the Australian Government? Do they understand the very premise of crypto-currencies?
@_date: 2013-12-30 16:41:54
I understand that aspect but; "And 21st Century Bitcoin Exchange says discussions will start soon with the government on regulating the Bitcoin market" sounds like more than just the ATMs themselves. The BTC market involves substantially more than a few $5k computers in cafes.

I'm not sure how this is a bad reflection on BTC? If you substitute BTC with any other fiat it's the same thing. If I purchase a product overseas and they try to charge more because the exchange rate changed between when I paid and when they shipped its got nothing to do with the tender used.
So anybody with half a brain here should realise this has nothing to do with BTC, its volatility or the recent downswing. And if OP is trying to spread negative shit about BTC then they need a better story.
