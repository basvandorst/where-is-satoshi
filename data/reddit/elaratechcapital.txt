Part of what makes Bitcoin so elegant. I think Gavin Anderson did a lot of the work towards this code pruning back in his day.

Purse.io is and has been one of the best places to spend bitcoin. Saves you a lot of money.

This will simply push demand towards equitable blockchain powered electricty solutions faster then. I'm sure that's exactly what the power companies ultimately want.

More adoption and use cases are always better. Your opinion is unpopular because it's wrong. An plausible example of an unpopular opinion is that BTC price dropping is good, for example.

It is fairly safe, just make sure that you do it in a public place and if the person has any sort of a reputation, you are very likely in the clear at that point.

The best tactic in times like that is to make sure that you can collect as much at cheaper price points that you can during that time frame. Even simply working a normal job will get you a larger piece of the pie than you could have received a few months ago.

This is the only plausible solution, but I would still guess it to be highly unlikely.

If you buy bitcoin but never sell/use/realize the gains then to the best of my knowledge you do not owe taxes. But one would argue why someone would never use their assets in their entire lifetime.

Optimists can really get the best of both worlds. Opportunity when price drops and financial rewards when price increases.

Nice to hear such great news! I am also happy to tell the world that a wall street analyst has never been wrong so I say let's all go for it.

With the advertisement bans from major companies and some serious legal tightening from major government bodies on the last bull run, it is possible that another bear market would ensue for an extended duration. But, like all other bear markets, similar to the 2014-2016 run, it will very unlikely last forever. Just long enough to shake out the weak hands.

It's just some person's perspective. I wouldn't look too far into it.

should strive to be in favor of adoption and use cases, generally speaking, not against.

While that's good for now, it's still important to always think ahead. The throughput for bitcoin is not sustainable as it is in the long run, regardless of it's present TX fees.

So glad I checked Reddit today, or else how else would I have known this critical must know piece of information?

I seriously doubt $100, there's too much underlying utility to the bitcoin network. On underlying utility by itself, the market is probably worth at least $500-2k on it's own right now. The surplus is arguably largely speculative at the moment (which does not mean that's a bad thing).
