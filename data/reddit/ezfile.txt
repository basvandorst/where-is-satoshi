Most of the site is encrypted, waiting on a wilcard ssl cert to do uploads/download subdomains
Its a bit more than a backup service since you can set files to be instantly downloaded by whoever you share it with, be able able to instantly download others files and so on, extend the expiry of files and visibility (public/private/instant) and there is a HTTP/JSON api to help automate things
More features are in the way such as import from torrents etc and an affiliate programme

Bitcoin has proven to be perfect match for our online storage service 
where instead of paying monthly fees, users can buy blocks of bandwidth and use it up for 1) downloading or 2) serving files or 3) storage
the fact that Visa/Mastercard/Paypal dont want anything to do with filestorage is another factor
Oh (inserting unashamed promotion) we now have a 2/3rds revenue share program with affiliates :)

Apologies but i thought it was quite relevant in context of Satoshi's quote, my service must have introduced thousands of people to bitcoin by now, which is a plus for everyone in the bitcoin ecosystem no? rising tide lifts all boats?
