If you can help me out on this Q that'd be great:
If I am using a Coldbit Steel, what address do I send the BTC to? And how do I ultimately access the BTC using the phrase to send them if needed?
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:29:55
Interesting, that is helpful - how do we know the total circulating coins is 1 mn?

Is the passphrase different than the 24 words? And if so how do I go about creating one?
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:25:02
Username checks out
@_date: 2019-08-05 16:41:14
Got it, so a trezor for example does that automatically.
Is there an additional layer of security available or is the passphrase good enough?

I mean I think this would be genius and not dirty, simply a brilliant strategy by a country looking out for its future.

Do we know this for sure or is this speculation? And if we know this for sure where are the signs? Genuinely curious because that would be incredibly bullish for BTC.

What is the genesis behind this 6.15 number? Just rando to have fun with or math behind it?

Quite interesting, thanks.
So it sounds like to be safe someone should not have any bitcoin on exchanges (duh) but to be extra safe you'd buy from a non-KYC place like Bisq?

Extremely interesting. If/when this is revealed publicly, have to imagine price skyrockets right?
And if so, a big reason this is currently being hid from the public.

Masa is a legendary investor and a billionaire many times over. Like bitcoin he is often overlooked and written off by the financial media as being too risky instead of visionary.
The fact that Masa got so invested is a fantastic sign for the space. Masa runs the $100 billion SoffBank Vision Fund, which invests in AI/robotics/5G type startup to mid-stage companies. It would not surprise me to see the Vision Fund take a large stake in bitcoin - their minimal investment is $100 million - which would be incredible for the space. The Vision Fund is a long-term fund and Masa himself has a 300 year strategy for SoftBank.
For the bitcoiners here who still like to invest in stocks, check out why Masa is doing - SoftBank equity has had an incredible run this year and may be poised for more if some events like Uber IPO and T-Mobile/Sprint merger unfold favorably.

100% - Masa is known for losing the most money ever in one day at the height of the tech bubble and subsequent collapse. A $130 million loss shouldn’t dissuade him from checking out the space again.

Omg that was incredible!! Especially because the market doubted him on the initial "SoftBank sells" news. That whole presentation was excellent, really showed the value of the portfolio. A pretty amazing opportunity for individual investors to gain exposure to companies they never would be able to elsewhere.

I agree 100%. All it takes is the Vision Fund to buy $100 mn, triple their investment, and then other investors will wonder, why wasn't that in the fund *I* am invested in? And plenty of people will then go out and buy it themselves.
Would also be pretty cool if Masa studies the space and invests/provides liquidity to interesting crypto startups that end up making a huge impact in the space, for example providing funding to build an online bitcoin bank, or investing in mining equipment, stuff like that. He has the money to do it, and if SVF were to make a killing on bitcoin, they'd have the money to play around with it.
Masa should be interested in bitcoin for a variety of reasons but especially the ASIC/GPU chip component, since he is so interested by chips and freaking bought Arm, another investment SoftBank gets little credit for.

I immediately thought of that as well! Either way, great news!

I'm planning on doing dollar cost averaging every week and then periodically moving to an offline wallet. Does that make sense?
Also - what's the process of moving from offline storage to cash out? I plan on being a hodler, but I'm thinking like decades down the line...do we think the cash out process will be the same then?
