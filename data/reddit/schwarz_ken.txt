Can someone ELI5 what Zeronet does for OB?

The short answer is less than $120 million.

Handing out small amounts of bitcoin to people is a good way to inform people about it. But the purchasing utility of a small amount of bitcoin makes it difficult for new users to spend it on anything meaningful.

You take the [overwhelming advice offered to you in r/legaladvice]( 
You also should contemplate the amount of [comedy gold]( you've [offered to reddit users]( 
Your next step is calling a lawyer.

I have used it. I'm really concerned about the Mod system. Anyone setting up a store can select their own Mod to handle disputes. It takes only three mouse clicks to become a mod. It would not be hard for a seller to set up a dummy Mod account or just work in collusion with someone who will always arbitrate in your favor.

Hopefully there will be. But then again, being able to manufacture your own dummy account Mod with a reputation is still a concern.

So after paying a premium is there anywhere in Madison that actually accepts Bitcoin? I think Bandung did once, but what is the point if nowhere natively accepts it?

What happens when objectionable or clearly illegal content gets posted? Is there a moderation system?

I've been following the updates for DATT and read this Yours post, but I just don't see awarding or being rewarded minuscule amount of satoshi incentive enough to drive content. How do you plan to scale to a larger audience beyond appealing to Bitcoin users?

If you look at the very bottom left corner of their main homepage in the About Bitbulls section, both "commodities" and "secure" are misspelled. 
Searching for Bitbulls on ABC, MarketWatch, Forbes, and USA turn up no results. So don't believe the homepage.
If you go to the FAQ you'll see under the [SEC Notice]( that BitBulls is not registered with the SEC, and "BitBulls operates more like a casino." 
They also do not have a Twitter account, despite having the Twitter logo on their page. 


What research did you do?

You're still spending money on miners that will probably never recover the cost you spent buying them.

Let me take a crack at this one too. 


Agreed. So far so good.


Yes, OB is a P2P marketplace. Is that a feature that will knock off the incumbent Amazon, eBay, or other online vendors? Probably not. Once you scale to that size you need a centralized organization to comply with laws, hire people, purchase capital, etcetera. So yes, P2P is great on the small scale. But in the bigger picture, perhaps not. 


Yes. 


Lending money to "credible friends" can ruin a friendship if they are suddenly unable to pay. Life happens, and suddenly as the lender you have to be the bad guy to recover the loan. Help a friend if they need it, but be prepared to be the bad guy. 


Please do clarify. Is this a libertarian dream where you only pay taxes for the schools, roads, and national defense as you need it? 


I'll just leave that one alone.
