Thanks for confirming and the reply.  I'll see what they say and report back.  Hoping I don't need to get lawyers/law enforcement involved.

Thank you.  I have been trying to get this resolved since July 2016 but have not had any luck so figured it wouldn't hurt to try to get some help from the community.

Thanks.  Make that over $400k now!  I already opened a case with FBI last year when this happened but did not get any responses from them other than thanks for submitting the info on ic3.gov.  I will try it again now maybe they will take it on.  I was under the impression I can only file a police report where I am located but at your suggestion, I will try to see if California police are able to help.  At this rate, I would even give up 30% as a reward to whoever (or whichever agency) is able to make this right for me.

Link to news article of Bitcoin Unlimited announcing non-profit designation and $500k "donation".  Wondering how many more of those coins could have been stolen.

Yes thanks for the advise, police were contacted but ended their investigation with the following response:  "Unfortunately, I have no more information for you. Both the prosecutors office and my direct supervisor have told me that this would not be a case investigated by us. If you need to document anything further in the Police Report, I will be happy to add it so you have a complete record of events."  Other government agencies were also provided with all of the details but has amounted to nothing.  Lawyer initially agreed to try and help but then a few months later he declined so now am left with trying this approach again.  If you have any other suggestions, I am open to them.  Thanks again for your response.

I have filed reports/complaints with numerous law enforcement agencies. 
I have no desire to spread any lies, just trying to get my money back. 
I contacted Kraken as soon as I saw the emails indicating my account was compromised showing an IP address in Mexico accessed the account and made changes.  
Also, I'm not the only account that was hacked on Kraken , there are a few people who have posted on reddit and other sites that their accounts were hacked and money stolen from them.

Walmart isn't accepting donations.  What if someone breaks into your house, takes your car keys, forges title papers for your car, and donates the car to a charity and you are able to trace this transaction and find your car in the parking lot of the charity. 
Would you let them keep your car?

It isn't just my account that was hacked.  There are quite a number of threads on reddit and elsewhere complaining about users getting money stolen....just Google or search in reddit Kraken Account Robbed.
This is one example: 
This is a recent post by someone indicating the robbery is still going on:

Looks like other users as well.  Email notifications with subject Suspicious Login on Kraken Account are being sent to multiple users.  
Please check your accounts and change your passwords!

There are other users reporting the same issue who did have 2FA enabled and funds were still stolen from their accounts.  My account was also hacked and money was stolen.

My Kraken account was hacked on 7/20 as well. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:10:56
I also had funds stolen from me on Kraken.

Same thing happened to me this morning at around 6:30am EST!!  
See below post my brother made for me on my behalf since I was unable to post due to lack of activity on my reddit account. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:21:12
Yes I also got that email, my account was hacked and funds stolen as well.
