Thanks pal
@_date: 2019-11-01 07:54:06
Very helpful thanks
@_date: 2019-11-03 12:50:59
Great info! Thanks for letting me know.
@_date: 2019-11-03 11:47:31
Appreciate all the comments but can someone explain to me why bitcoin.org lists a difference in “transparency” between the two hardware wallets?

Whenever you see posts like this, buy!
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:54:44
If you don’t believe in the possibility of a bull run in the future then you need a lesson on market cycles. (Basic economics btw)
Or maybe the correlation between scarcity and value. (Very basic concept as well)
Or maybe you just do not understand how the demand for digital assets can rise exponentially in a digital future. 
Anyways my point is whenever there is blood on the streets buy.
It’s completely okay not to believe in what I’m saying or bitcoin in general. However in that case you need to get off this subreddit and find some more productive hobbies in things you do believe in.
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:55:10
Wow. Totally agree with the last sentence
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:54:50
Lol don’t be mad because you cannot afford bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:07:30
“I already lived through two pumps” you’re saying that like majority of everyone here didn’t. “I’m not here to say I have more bitcoin or whatever” but you are telling me when you started buying and speculating on how much I hold? 
Really funny and conflicting reply. Anyways like I said many people here see a sustained price increase in the future, and misinformed write ups like yours only prove that point. If you do not that’s completely fine (as I had said before)
Just a bit sad that you are on a bitcoin subreddit arguing about something you do not believe in.
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:55:07
Simply put yes. And that just shows you how highly I place the value of this asset in future. 
Your excessive “haha” points to the fact you’re actually not laughing, you have nothing more sensible to say or both. 
I can bet you are a nocoinner who probably can not afford to buy btc at current prices or bought too high during the last bull run and bailed with some hefty losses. Which one is it?
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:43:35
That’s the whole idea
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:59:04
It’s not being done secretly though. Very openly actually. Most asset managers in the us now admit to having some exposure in digital assets and the rest say they are likely to buy in the foreseeable future, or invest in investment vehicles which hold digital assets. Everything around us is pointing to increased institutional adoption. I think if you can agree that btc is here to stay then you must understand that no financial instrument moves in one direction it either booms or bust. We have seen the low from the 2017 uptrend following a downtrend that lasted for almost 2 years. Now we are emerging into an uptrend, right before the next halving and financial recession in the states. I am in no way saying I know for sure what will happen in future but I am definitely betting on another bull run which will cement btc as a household asset and usher in the digital age.

So if any entity tried to trace where all the tokens from MEW went, they would be able to trace it to my bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:31:08
You do not need to worry when I bought bitcoin, because I’m sure as hell not worried when or if you even did.
What you should pay attention to instead maybe is the growing institutional adoption and interest. 
Instead of caring about what YouTubers are saying. 
Here’s a quote for you “The 2013 bubble was driven by technocrats and dark web trawlers and the 2017 rally was led by the whims of speculative retail traders, future growth belongs to financial institutions who are diversifying stale portfolios and finally have the professional machinery to do so.”
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:06:56
I sure will. Thanks
@_date: 2019-10-27 11:34:30
For sure
@_date: 2019-10-29 09:29:13
I smirked at some point. But awful attempt at a joke overall. P.s I’m Nigerian
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:16:32
Not surprised you have succumbed to insults, very typical of an inferior mind. 
Anyways good luck spreading your FUD somewhere else.
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:23:21
So why are you focused on what some air heads who are clearly in it for the wrong reasons think? Or what YouTube videos are saying? 
Why not focus on the actually underlying fundamentals and blur the noise out.
This whole post just sounds like a very intolerable person lashing out at the bad actors he doesn’t like through a FUD reddit post.
@_date: 2019-10-10 08:36:19
You will never see bitcoin below $6,000 again, unless regulation shatters it. Mark my words
@_date: 2019-12-06 07:54:12
Congratulations, great use of your time lol
@_date: 2019-12-11 10:41:44
Low quality content maybe, but all in all a quote I want you to remember.
@_date: 2019-12-14 18:34:03
You deserve a medal
