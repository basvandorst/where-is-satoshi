My reason was with the high fees of December and the fact I acquired them free from the fork, why not hold and see what happens. But with low fees to send BTC, I’m not sure I see the point of BCH anymore?

Harsh to exclude stellar lumens

Only for another two months or so

I was thinking more of him not vociferously denying (and almost agreeing) the tech crunch article that ETH will trade to zero.  He’s denied it now, but after a good few days of FUD.

Is heaven decentralised? 
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:55:16
Never less than 3k
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:16:17
Perhaps the articles themselves and the optimistic rubbish masquerading as TA are the problem?

Let’s just make it happen rather than “pray”

I’d like to see negative opinions backed up by short selling. Then I’ll listen. The tweet makes sense 
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:36:08
You never know, but I’d be amazed if it ever got within 1k of your buy-in price. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:25:32
I stand corrected. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:58:31
Ha! That’ll be Surbiton station, where I disembarked. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 13:23:35
Is that in Kraków?

I nearly missed my train waiting for a photo empty of people. I consider one person visible in a place like Waterloo a small personal victory :) 
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:59:57
Exactly noon 
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:28:37
I wondered this too. I like to think it represents a “step backwards” :) 
@_date: 2018-06-06 11:32:37
As in real advertisement at Waterloo? Yes!

London, England, as the yanks like to say!

There’s varying definitions of “rich”

I’m guessing there’d still be profitability for miners with BTC at $1000? 
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:26:41
Agreed. Now just to convince Bezos... 
@_date: 2018-03-31 17:44:10
Yet he doesn’t....

Not quite as bad as your luck but I found a cancelled contact on my localbitcoins account from 2013, I spurned the opportunity to buy another 14 coins for £10k.

“True Digital Cash” worked for me back in 2013

£30k invested in November 2013 was £650k in December 2017
