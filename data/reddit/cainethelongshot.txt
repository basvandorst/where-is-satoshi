Agreed - a year in equities is a relativistic month in crypto. But a lot of hodlers check portfolios by the minute (myself included) when they won't act on price information anyway, so I feel like there's a lesson there.

The fact that you feel you can finally save in a currency that appreciates in value says volumes. In 2015 I started doing the same, I'd not go to restaurants, not buy stuff I didn't need etc. Every time I'd just buy the equivalent bitcoin.

Great to hear. I also teach crypto courses, and something I've found effective is to run a "build your own blockchain" exercise where everyone acts as miners and gets pieces of paper where they can record transactions from a mempool that we put up and then solve a relatively easy problem to "mine" the block.
The person who solves it adds it to the blockchain pinned to the board and gets the block reward. It illustrates how any one person (Miner) is unlikely to solve the problem 6 times in a row.

If you are using SHA-256 ASICs like an S9 or S11, then I'd suggest you use Slushpool since payouts are automatic and quick, plus they let you set your vote as a miner on various proposals.
If you are using L3s that can mine more coins, then I'd say NH is best as it will automine the most profitable Scrypt coin and convert to Bitcoin. Be aware that withdrawing coins from NH takes 24 hours before they send and has a relatively high fee.

Two years ago, the Brexit vote was concluded, and I had convinced two friends to buy some bitcoin. My rationale was that Bitcoin would be a good hedge in an increasingly unstable world.
We wrote the bet onto a bottle of wine, and it gives perspective to see it now. The price at the time was $652.63. One person bet it would be more than 10% down. The other that it would be more than 20% up. I took the middle ground.
When this bet was taken, I never thought I'd be in a world where bitcoin has gone 10X and we'd be complaining about it.

Your question of the optimal DCA schedule is actually a special case of knowing what the price will do. If you knew that, then you would not bother with rebalancing and you'd just go 100X long or short.
In summary no one really knows the best DCA frequency into the future. We can only retroactively apply it.
Hodlbot did a good article on the question of best rebalancing period for an index, which is again the same question of DCA period and can be condensed to knowing what the price will do tomorrow. [

This is absolutely true over the last few days - but does not explain the decline over the last 3 months. That is due to the lowest volume cost of production being reached - where price drops cause significant volumes of miners to go offline - similar to an oil price drop causing the more expensive producers to stop extracting oil.

I buy used Bitcoin miners and because of my cheap power deal, they pay back in 2 months and 9 days. After that it's pure profit. Mining is far from dead - if it were, the hash rate would drop dramatically.
As long as your power is less than about 0.09 USD per kWh, it's profitable.
@_date: 2018-11-19 21:02:31
This is a very good point - I was thinking that the best way for colluding nation states to attack bitcoin would be slow accrual enabling a price dump on account of low volume, after which hash power can be (relatively) cheaply bought via a hashing marketplace such as nicehash.

Nice one man, it is surprisingly usable in South Africa, I've been living off it as far as possible in SA for the last year. 
Just a heads-up: Luno charges quite a high fee to send BTC. If you are keen to use it from time to time from a phone wallet, it's better to transfer like R1000 to a wallet such as BRD and use that to make payments - it's cheaper and quicker plus you can access your private keys.

@_date: 2019-01-17 20:48:50
It's a good point (akin to buying into an ICO where the team will sell the coins), but I suspect that it may drive adoption in some cases:
1. The donors who have reason to boycott Patreon actually buy and use bitcoin because it's an alternative, see how it works and have their first exposure.
2. The beneficiary holds the bitcoin because they also saw how useful it is (and may not want to liquidate instantly). This happened with wiki leaks where Assange famously thanked Visa and Mastercard for banning them which resulted in their donations being in BTC, which rose massively in value (so a lot was probably hodled).
We're at the point where BTC is accepted in relatively few places, and so I think that getting more people to hear about it and use it is a good thing at this proto stage of the project.
As an example the founder of the BTC exchange in Zimbabwe originally used it to get paid for international web dev work (an example of someone taking bitcoin and liquidating it immediately) and via exposure, got into it and built an exchange that thousands of people use for remittances and procuring BTC.

I would suggest putting them into an index bot like [HODLbot]( because if we see another bull run, I suspect alts will pump more than bitcoin as noobs try buy into "the next bitcoin while it's still early" and you can then increase your btc holdings.
The bot will save you from keeping coins that fail and go to zero, as well as keep a market cap weighted portion in BTC (so if that goes back to 80-90% dominance you'll trade out of alts anyway)

It has been proposed that this is an important indicator. Never in bitcoin's history has the price dipped below that which is profitable for the majority volume of miners to continue operating (you can see this because there has never been a sustained and steep drop-off in hashrate comparable to what we've seen with price). Some have suggested that it is a sign of a price floor. Do your own research though!

BTC Hodler, using [HODLbot]( for a portion of the portfolio with a long-term view that in the near-term bull runs, a rebalancing index of alts will enable one to increase their bitcoin position.

Good to see fellow small miners keeping things decentralised. I'm running 50 S9s in a container and my model is to procure them second-hand for ±$200 apiece. My energy price is $0.042 / kWh. Even at those rates I am concerned about larger players mining with new more efficient ASICS in secret before selling them, and my payback being hard to achieve.
But if you are going to start mining, doing it in a bear market when others are shutting down is by far a better strategy than starting at the peak of a bull run like everyone else did.
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:30:48
Agree with the points, but I do think that, as with previous bull runs, holding an index of alts is a great way to increase bitcoin holdings in the short term.

@_date: 2018-07-03 19:29:15
Thanks, makes sense. I see that there are some projects letting you contribute GPU power to machine learning applications and earn more than mining coins which are still mined on GPU. Though no longer relevant to bitcoin since ASICs, it will be interesting to see what impact this has for other cryptos where the opportunity cost of hardware is lower by way of alternate applications.

It depends what you mean by a quantum computer (QC). Grover's search algorithm allows a QC to achieve exponential advantage over binary computers in solving SHA-256 with linear qubit increments. 
Likewise, Shor's factoring algorithm allows a similar dynamic with respect to ECDSA upon which the public-private keypairs are generated.
In both cases you need more reliable qubits. You can have a QC with 4 reliable qubits and that won't enable a meaningful attack on BTC. 
The best defence is probably game theoretic rather than technical: If you have a QC you get one shot to use it before the world's cryptography responds: would you attack Bitcoin, or the world's banks, governments and espionage agencies (NSA)?

Accounting for and being aware of the risk of leaving money on exchanges, I've been getting between 2 and 4.6% daily interest rates on margin lending. Assuming it persists for only a couple of days, I think the return will be far higher than dumping Bitcoin Cash.

I think we're all in agreement that in the long run, Bitcoin is the one to have and the one that will succeed. But I think you're giving new investors too much credit. Institutions will take an index approach to cryptos to "spread risk" and retail investors are going to fall for the next ICO (IEO or whatever they will be called this time). I suppose it remains to be seen, but if today's action is anything to go by (look at how LTC, EOS etc have responded to the BTC pump) then we may well be in for temporary reduced BTC dominance ending in 99% in ~2140 :)
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:44:33
The centralisation debate has been had many times and there are certainly many viewpoints on it. Likewise, whether we will be able to build some or all financial infrastructure on top of Bitcoin remains to be seen.
I suppose where we differ is that you believe Bitcoin will fail outright, while I believe it will be an innovative and useful technology. No amount of debate will resolve it, we will just have to wait and see.

I don't think we will see the rapid and "predictable" collapse of USD, but we will certainly see continued and reliable inflation in all fiat currencies. I had a similar situation in 2015 when my currency lost 30% value overnight (I live in Africa). I decided to start slowly cost-averaging into bitcoin over 2 years. If you can ignore the volatility, it's been an amazing store of value over multi-year long periods.
Good luck, and stick to your plan whatever it is! Don't day trade, accumulate slowly and hold for the long term.

That is a good point for US citizens - I recall one story of a person who owed more than their net worth at the end of 2017 because of this.

@_date: 2019-05-21 18:43:39
I agree that BTC will emerge as the eventual winner, but along the way, altcoins (call them shitcoins if you want - they mostly are) have been a great way to asymmetrically increase your bitcoin. This is purely due to the psychology of newcomers to the market, who are looking for the "next" bitcoin, looking for something with low fees that "can scale" without understanding Bitcoin.
Remember, 1 BTC put in an index of altcoins was 7 bitcoin at the end of the year because of this psychology. Granted, alts underperformed BTC during the bear market - but by far less than they outperformed during the bull market.
I really don't think it imprudent to put 10% of your BTC into an index including altcoins - just be ready to take profits into BTC which will likely be the ultimate winner.
Just because you hold alts to increase your BTC doesn't mean you believe in them.
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:40:30
I would argue that in the event of a bull run, altcoins are the best way of increasing your bitcoin holdings. 1 BTC placed in the [HODLbot.io]( HODL30 index at the start of 2017 resulted in 6.9 BTC by the end of the year.  
I don't believe in alts longterm, but they have the potential to multiply your BTC. I'd say got half to 75% into BTC, and put half to 25% into an index like HODLbot.

On some exchanges (like poloniex) you can loan your cryptos to people who are shorting them. At the moment you get a pretty good rate for BTC because the supply is limited (people moved their BTC off the exchange to get their BTC balance matched on Bitcoin Cash) and the demand is high (some people feel that the launch of Bitcoin Cash could mean a dip in BTC)

What hardware do you need to make the SMS and banking payment system work? Server farms, a network of base station antennae, bank branches, POS devices, bank office buildings, etc. 
Remember, to use Bitcoin, you hardly need any tech at all. This is just an example of all the bits in the background in one place for illustration. About 10,000 people around the world runs nodes (the bit on the left - usually on their laptops), and the mining tends to be done en-masse by people incentivised to do so).

The whole genius of bitcoin's design is the aligning of game theory incentives. 99.99% of miners do so for profit, and through their "greed" we have the most secure network in the world.
Remember the Adam Smith quote: "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest."
I also run a full node and a Lightning node as support to the network, buy my mining operation is much bigger because it is profitable - and contributes to the security of Bitcoin.

All fair points, and for me that's the beauty of a free-market money. Anyone can invent a crypto as you described (in fact I think Nano with their DAG operates in a way similar to what you suggest) and we can let the market decide what works best, what's too expensive etc. Evolution will apply to those that survive. Something not present in mandated fiat currency.
I agree with Adam Smith who said "Security is superior to opulence" and as such don't see mining as wasteful, but as the only long-term security solution which can withstand attacks from colluding nation states. Of course you only discover that you had too little security when you face an absorbent barrier and then are ruined. 
The recipe for crypto is here to stay and can never be un-invented - the design parameters and extent of its impact remain to be seen. I've been along for the ride since 2015 and am excited to see where it goes!
