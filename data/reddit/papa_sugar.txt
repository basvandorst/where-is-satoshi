That's pretty much the same as the price in the states if bought by the ounce in a nonlegal state, but I've seen grams go for $20 and 8ths for $60. Prices scale more evenly in states with some sort of legal market though. Weed prices are all over the map here.

I'm guessing neither of you read the Reddit post? The user says that IGOT resolved the issue and they got their bitcoin. Hardly a smoking gun.

Or the groups would collude and all take bribes. You know like unregulated private entities used to do?

I'm not saying there is no corruption in law enforcement or politics. I'm saying that competing entities can easily collude and choose to all be corrupt rather than actually engaging in competition. Thats why things like price fixing and the like exist. Competitive entities realize they can make more money by ceasing competition and colluding. The market won't fix that if groups collude together to keep new entrants out of the market. It's happened before it will happen again. Inertia is a powerful force.
Though there is corruption in politics it would almost certainly be worse in a wild west of sorts. The trick to regulating police departments and politicians is that the regulating agency must be completely separate. That's where the primary failure in internal affairs and government watchdogs are. They usually exist in close proximity to the agency the regulate and draw their employees directly from the ranks of those they are meant to regulate. Instead the people that do the regulating need to be drawn from a completely separate, unrelated pool. That's not currently happening, but it's a fixable problem.

These businesses take, hold, and transmit fiat. That makes them a financial service and subject to regulation.

Very wrong. NY has a catch all category under financial services definitions to prevent people from challenging the authority of the government to regulate novel businesses in the financial sector. From Chapter 18-a of the Consolidated laws Sections 104: "...or any financial product or service offered or sold to consumers..." 
Section 302 of the same which gives the Superintendent the power to regulate those services covered by definition in Section 104: 
(a) The superintendent shall have the power to prescribe and from time to time withdraw or amend, in writing, rules and regulations and issue orders and guidance involving financial products and services, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, the banking law, the insurance law and any other law in which the superintendent is given authority:
(1) effectuating any power given to the superintendent under the provisions of this chapter, the insurance law, the banking law, or any other law to prescribe forms or make regulations;
(2) interpreting the provisions of this chapter, the insurance law, the banking law, or any other applicable law; and
(3) governing the procedures to be followed in the practice of the department.
(b) The superintendent may promulgate a list of financial products and services excluded from regulation by the superintendent, provided that such exclusion shall not limit in any way the ability of the superintendent to take any actions with respect to fraud provided for in this chapter, the insurance law, the banking law or any other applicable law.

Relevant bit from NY Law that gives the authority: "...or any financial product or service offered or sold to consumers..." From chapter 18-a of the Consolidated Laws. Section 104.

$5.90? I know sales tax is high some places, but it's not really 18% is it? Where I live in the US it's like 8%.

Basically to be a bitcoin business. It's mostly about regulating exchanges and pseudo exchanges which take, hold, and transmit both fiat and virtual currencies. Honestly, I'm not really sure why everyone is up in arms about it. I read the regulation and it doesn't really seem outrageous.

Just use a fake name. They don't validate

You haven't read the regulations have you? It cites the statutory authority at the very beginning. Statutory Authority: Financial Services Law, sections 102,104, 201, 206, 301, 302, 309, and 408
