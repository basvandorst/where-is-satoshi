I'd post something like this too if I was a whale and looking to cause panic before I made a big buy.

You may proceed as planned.

If coming back down means going up, then yes you are right!

Search around that wiki. It is your friend.

Give it to me. I already know what to do with it. You will not have to worry yourself about that anymore.

Nasty dirty-little-secret alert:
1. Right-click on that ad (or the tiny space in the rectangle surrounding it if it's a flash ad like the t-mobile one).  
2. Select "inspect element" from the menu (chrome or firefox, not sure about others) It will pop up some HTML code. Bonus points if you find this div:  &lt;div id="leftbar_outer"&gt;, but that's not 100% nesessary.
3. Right click on that highlighted code and select "delete node"
4. Enjoy your screen with no ad!
