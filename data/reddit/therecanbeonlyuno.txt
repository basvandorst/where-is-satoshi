bitcoin is fiat money?
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:54:42
Intrinsic value is the ability to use the currency for something even if you can't trade it. The fact that you said to buy and hold the currency for 5 years suggests its not money at all but instead something to speculate on.

So no, I can't use it at every corner store.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:37:33
Bitcoin's only status is as a means of payment.
Scarcity doesn't create value. A use for a good and scarcity create value. The last shit I took was scarce, this does not make it valuable. Bitcoin has no use outside of money, which makes it fiat because it has no intrinsic value.

This same logic lead to the tech bubble in 2001, the savings and loan crisis, the great recession and basically every bubble in the last 100 years. Get out while you can.

When one person's spending is another's income, isn't it impossible for everyone to save at the same time?

Prices denominated in bitcoins have to fall. MV=PY. If Y increases P decreases.
Also, you might want to ask Malthus how that limited growth argument turns out.

"Kensyians don't believe gold is money"
"Commodity money is both money and an asset. Commodity money is a medium of exchange that is a good, normally gold or silver that has intrinsic value in other uses"
Krugman "Macroeconomics" 3rd Edition
Gold is commodity money. Bitcoin is neither a commodity or money.
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:39:55
What gives it intrinsic value? Can I melt it down and make a ring like gold?

Doesn't it take 10-20 minutes for a transaction to clear? Don't credit cards and paypal do the same?

The value of a dollar and price levels in dollars change by less than 5% a year most years. Is the value of bitcoin that stable?
If everyone stopped accepting bitcoin tomorrow, how valuable would your bitcoins be?
You also don't seem to get why deflation is bad.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:45:18
Nevermind technological growth, the Hartwick rule or the fact that they were just ridiculously wrong about peak oil. We'll trust a report that is over 30 years old because confirmation bias. 
And you seem to completely misunderstand the quantity of money theory. All prices are denominated in every currency. 1 currency or 10000 they will all have to follow the equation of exchange because it is an accounting identity.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:24:32
Bitcoin is a commodity that doesn't fit any of the typical functions of money. People are buying it purely as a speculation. Please explain how this thing that has no value outside of transactions is not a bubble when people are buying it to hoard and resell?
"...the main functions of money are distinguished as: a medium of exchange; a unit of account; a store of value..."
 
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:40:11
Except bitcoin is also a fiat currency.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:05:35
That sounds like a shit investment.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:25:43
Bitcoin is deflationary as long as the money supply grows slower than output. Given the rate of growth in bitcoin is constantly slowing, it will likely become deflationary very soon if it is not already.
Plus, that assumes that bitcoin is the only option for exchange. Why wouldn't i sit on my bitcoin and spend dollars?
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:15:34
That is a lot of words to say nothing.

"...its value arises entirely from the fact that it is generally accepted as a means of payment..."
"Fiat money is a medium of exchange whose value derives entirely from its official status as a means of payment"
Krugman "Macroeconomics" Third Edition page 415
I think my definition is ok. 
Bitcoin as a commodity?
"Commodity money a medium of exchange that is a good, normally gold or silver, that has intrinsic value in other uses"
same source, page G-2
What other use does Bitcoin have again?
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:39:40
Fiat money means it has no inherent value. Please explain what physical good you can use bitcoins to produce.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:47:15
So bitcoin can't be hurt by deflation because they can add a few more significant digits to prices?
So inflation wasn't a problem in Zimbabwe because they just added a few more zeros to their currency?
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:16:47
If your investment requires you to argue against economic theory for it to make sense, it might be a bubble or a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:46:07
That is not intrinsic value. That is a basic characteristic of all money. And considering most businesses do not accept bitcoin, it is one that makes it very sketchy if bitcoin is money at all.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:11:10
1. Yeah, a change in price because of technological change is not deflation. You got the definition wrong there.
2. If I can hoard bitcoin and make the same transaction with dollars, why use dollars? Also, why would I accept bitcoin then? I have to wait in order for the currency I accepted to be worth the good? Why would I do that when I can receive the value of the good today? Have you not heard of the time value of money?
Your argument seems to be based on not knowing the definition of deflation and a weird understanding of how interest rates work.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:12:03
Its a way of getting intelligent people who understand more computer science than economics to give you money in exchange for something doomed to fail.
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:38:00
So why would one make long term investments if the cost of that investment will fall in the next period?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:49:36
But why would you choose bitcoin as a store of wealth? Gold has the obvious ability to be melted down and turned into something. Bitcoin doesn't have that.
Also, why is it necessary to denote things in bitcoins when dollars (spent via PayPal or Credit Cards) are easier to understand as a unit of value? This makes bitcoin sound like the Segway of currencies. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:56:28
What gives bitcoin any value outside of transactions?
Bitcoin is fiat money because it lacks intrinsic value. This is a basic ECON 101 definition.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:16:22
This bot has intrinsic value.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:29:13
Prices in bitcoins will always have to fall. Hence deflation.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:35:58
So I can use bitcoin at the corner store? And they will know how many bitcoin to charge for a gallon of milk? And the value of that bitcoin will be roughly the same (maybe + or - 2%) in a year?

Bubbles are built on dreams.

Gold's quantity increased slowly and never had a hard limit, and there still was deflation and economic malaise for decades while we were on the gold standard. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:39:11
Mining caps out at 21 million bitcoin, and the creation rate is constantly slowing. This is deflationary if the rate of growth in output does not slow at the same rate.

You don't seem to know what a bubble is.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:07:34
Are you aware of something called the Great Depression? When your money gains value without you doing anything, you sit on your money and invest less. This leads to fewer jobs. The only reason this won't happen with bitcoin is that it is not widely used. Unfortunately, a currency that only has value through transactions is worthless if everyone buys it just to sit on it. The whole increase in value for bitcoin seems to be driven by this story about what it is or how it is revolutionary. Just like the dotcom bubble in 2000.

Crypto currencies fit into economic theory. They are almost-but-not-actually money until they fit the three main rolls of money, and they are fiat money because they have no intrinsic value in production.
The issue seems to be  techno-libertarians don't understand that putting something on a computer does not change the definition of money or its basic roll in transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:37:09
Deflation is a fall in prices. Dividing bitcoin into smaller denominations is deflation. When output increases in relation to a fixed number of currency we get deflation.
There is no inherent value to bitcoins, it is fiat money because you can't produce anything with them.
