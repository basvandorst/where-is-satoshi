Haven't tried to call yet but that number seems to be associated with Ryan Singer who was COO of Tradehill:  and he also seems to be involved with 20mission.

I LOdL.

Jared was the CEO: 
I tried reaching him without success. There's a reasonable chance that he stole the coins and spent them unfortunately.

Wow that's a weird coincidence, I also lost exactly 10 BTC on Tradehill. I tried PMing yesterday on Reddit but he hasn't replied. I read that someone was able to recover their Bitcoin a while back but only after hiring a lawyer...

It's ok, a Ferrari is an asset.

That's what Segwit2x was about... a short term solution to scalability while better solutions are developed. But according to this sub, it was the work of Satan because MBAs, CEOs and China.

Yes, looks like he is involved with 
WHOIS on tradehill.com shows this info:

I happen to live close by. Also considering to lawyer up.

Plus, I heard the Bitcoin Cash guys have bigger ***cks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:41:01
I was able to get a reply from jered "I can't do anything for you. I don't have any records of your deposit or any coins from Tradehill or personally."
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:16:59
Damn, I wish Roger Ver would pick on me too :(
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:58:40
You assume that the coins were lost but what I'm saying is it's likely that the CEO stole them and spent them. I'm not sure there's much we can do except lawyer up...
edit: I just found an old email I sent in 2013 to Jered about my coins and he hasn't replied.

Not having to work for someone else is a big one. That 3.3 BTC invested in a very safe asset (e.g. stock market index) could pull in 300-500$/month for the rest of his/her life. That's enough to retire in some countries.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:39
any of you got their BTC back?

They even have a professor:

Plot twist: OP kept the 10 BTC stash and told his GF it was only 0.008 BTC.

True... Was expecting a SFW eating of his left nut.
