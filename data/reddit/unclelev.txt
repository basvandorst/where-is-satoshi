Yes, this makes sense.
The film is done. They screened it a month ago. Why they simply cannot throw it up online yet really suggests they are less about getting the movie out there and more about how they can best capitalize off it.
I'm pretty sure there's a word for that.

Yes, exactly this.
Someone else defended them by saying we need to understand the way producing and distributing movies works.
No we don't. We do, and as you said they are apparently relying on ancient distribution methods.
The film was screened a month ago, so it's obviously done.
The shenanigans now are nothing but licensing, marketing, distribution deals they are trying to work out. All of which means dick to the people who funded it and dick to those who just want to see the film and not prioritized less than "how can we really make money off selling this?".

People are downvoting you because you're defending archaic practices and not acknowledging that times have changed. Pretty much all you said is not the reality anymore.
It is easier than ever today to distribute digital media. Anyone can post a book, application or even film in seconds and have it available to millions of people worldwide. We don't live in the same world anymore.
That it is taking this long has nothing to do with distribution. The film has been screened and is complete. It takes minutes to toss it up online.
The time it is taking now is solely because they are more concerned about how they can best capitalize off this, than get the story out there.
The very fact that they haven't even allowed those who funded the damn thing to see it yet really shows how they want to protect it from getting out there (via leak) before they have devised a plan for making the most they can out of it.
Yes, I know people produce things to make money. But when you take other people's money to produce things, and then you snub them while you try to make more for yourself (that you certainly won't share with those that made your dream possible) you're just being dickish.

really fucking cheesy, thus really fucking good
@_date: 2014-05-23 06:56:16
I actually agree with you on that.
There's ... well, there's a LOT of fucking cheese.
Cheese is under it all, and then... on top! I realized after putting the pepperonis on top that the contrast would suck. That's why I decided to opt for another layer of cheese for better contrast. :D
But I'm with you on that!

I'm not going to buy Watch Dogs or play it at all. :)
You're speaking in hyperbole by comparing a crowd-funded project that was completely financed by the people wanting to see it, to a AAA game produced by one of the largest game publishers in the world.

Sure, have at it!

I've actually been going through the same thought process.
I'd also love to pay for it now, but if it ends up being available late in the summer, I'll also likely just get it off TPB. I take issue with doing business with those who don't project the professionalism you'd expect.

May I inquire as to what you were sending that sum of coins for in the first place?
Was the mistake sending the coins to the wrong address, or not meaning to send the coins at all?
I'm really curious about what the coins were supposed to go to.

Thanks for the info - I hadn't checked out their Twitter before.
Sadly, it also looks as scarce in the relevant information department. The last mention of anything relating to the distribution was at the end of April.
With so many people invested in this, I think they ought to be doing more.
Nonetheless, thanks for the twitter mention!
