Everyone who bought has made money other than the few people that bought for the few weeks in history that btc has been higher than the current level. Just hold and stop trying to time the market.

The point is that you have to be justifiably relying on the untrue statement. If you buy because you think it's a fraud, then it's going to be hard to argue that you were relying on the untrue statement.

No. Think about what a negative price would mean - you'd have pay someone to buy your BTC from you. That would never happen.   
You could go negative if you took out a loan to buy your BTC - you take out a loan of $100 to buy BTC, then BTC goes to 0 and you still owe $100 to the lender.

Be careful with that - if you know it's a fraud and do it anyways, it doesn't count as fraud.

The whole point of DCA is so that you buy more of the asset when the price is lower, and less of the asset when the price is high so that your average buy-in price is equal to the average of all prices during the buying phase of your investment period. DCA will always be profitable IF the price trends upwards over the term of your investment period.
TLDR: If you believe an asset will increase in value over time, DCA will always be profitable. So why not just free yourself of all the mental burden of timing, trading and second guessing and just DCA.  
EDIT: To explain further, you may be asking, "if I believe that the price will go up over the long term, why don't I just invest all of my money right now instead of DCAing?".  
The answer requires a little logical analysis, which can be summarized as "you don't know if the price will be higher or lower tomorrow, even if  you're sure it will increase long term, so just split the investment between both days". If we assume that the value of an asset will increase, then any investment in that asset will be profitable. But we also recognize that an asset can increase in value over time, but fluctuate wildly in the short term, so there's a question of how to make that investment. By saying that you (the general "you", not you specifically, it's a metaphor) believe the price of the asset will go up, you are saying that the current price undervalues the asset. And yet, the price is below the asset's value. So we have established that you don't have the ability to accurately predict the price in the short term. Given that you don't have the ability to accurately predict the price in the short term, you must acknowledge that the price could go down in the short term and you wouldn't be able to predict it. To mitigate that risk, you decide that you will simply buy at the average price over the buying phase of your investment period (by DCAing). Investing all of your funds at a single price in a fluctuating market will cause higher variation in your eventual (still profitable) return.

Good point, alternatively you could build a nuclear reactor, add in some mercury, shoot some neutrons at it and VOILA!  Gold.    
The question I'm curious about now is: how expensive would gold have to be for that process to be profitable?

Pretend trading - Trading without real money.

It's actually been done before - in 1942 (based on some quick research so I admit I haven't vetted the source).
