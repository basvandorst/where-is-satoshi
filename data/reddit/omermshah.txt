He doesn't get paid in bitcoin though; he's just buying bitcoins with his dollars every payday. The employer sends out dollars; bitwage buys bitcoins at the going rate with those dollars and charges some fee along the way. Then he uses his card to sell bitcoins for dollars which the merchant accepts.

I think the issue is that eventually the business will need to pay taxes in their local currency. No matter how tightly they can close the loop between customers, vendors, and employees they'll need actual money at some point to pay income tax, property tax etc.

Yeah absolutely; I think it will take a major event for the next step down to happen to bring the price window to $200-$220. I might just cover my position at $245ish and just be happy with the profit. Plus when I made the trade CAD and USD were fairly close in value so when I close my positions I'll make a bit of money because of rate change too.

"SGI offers both accelerator options for its
products thus working with Cloudcroft to ensure the next supercomputer stays green, reaches the
highest ranks of the T500 list, and **continues to perform through innovation is very synergistic.** "
Yup this totally real letter was written by a company against a $100 Million contract.

Just to add to this a little bit; your branch can order gold in coins, bars, and certificates. I would strongly recommend the coins. The coins have a fiat face value of $50 but are purchased at the market price for gold. Basically what this means is that your gold has a price floor of the fiat value. It doesn't cost you any extra to get the coin vs the bar but the coin gives you that free insurance of a price floor. Also be aware that prices are quoted in USD if you're canadian; this will mean an uphill journey against the exchange rate. If you're converting BTC to gold then do BTC to USD rather than BTC to CAD.

Its sad because that Hodling behavior is what stops it from becoming big. Merchants don't want it if they only ever see one or two transactions. 
People need to start buying stuff with their bitcoin at whatever the rate is today; not some fantasy rate 10 years from now.
Now the unfortuante thing is that most people holding Bitcoins at this point are in the red; they most likely bought after the $1000 price point and the coin has lost value consistently since then. These people believe that if they hodl they can avoid taking "real losses" and only suffer book losses till the price hopefully recovers. 
Basically; the thought pattern of "why would I spend bitcoin today for a sandwich when the same amount could buy me a house in 5 years" is the downfall.

It can all just be replicated without paying the price for the token. Its actually quite smart the setup these private chains. They aren't creating competing currencys though so theres no real harm to bitcoin the currency. 
Its like banks using the same systems they use for our checking accounts to also setup mortgages and savings accounts; the underlying tech is the same but it doesn't replace the checking account.

I think people are more comfortable seeing  so if we used World Wide Ledger and hosted the addresses at the WWL it might help with adoption.

You don't understand what entrapment is. Entrapment is when an agent of the government convinces you to commit a crime you would not have otherwise committed; them just telling you they're using your coins for something illegal is not entrapment. Now if you refuse to sell them coins but they won't leave you alone and keep trying to push you to commit the crime then yes that might count as entrapment, but simply giving you their intent is not an entrapment issue.

This is pretty common in most pyramid schemes and financial frauds. I'm publically short on bitcoin so obviously I want to see the price go down; and for that reason I believe those coins are not lost and that whoever controls those keys will spend them at some point.

Just to add to this; you could be a drug dealer and claim your drug dealing income to the IRS and not get in trouble with them. You claim this type of illegal income as Fifth amendment cloaked income. United States v. Brown, 600 F.2d 248, 252 (10 th Cir. 1979) is the relevant case which established that your fifth amendment rights protect you from revealing the source of the income but you must still reveal the amount for tax purposes.

That's what I don't want, in the current system your employer dictates what type of care is covered.

Holy shit free money! anyone know a good way to automate the sweeping? I just want to send my transaction to move the small amounts as quickly as possible to my own wallet; even if I only get left with a small amount after the fee. Can I set it up so that my fee can be a max of the amount I'm sweeping minus some small percentage? So like if I'm sweeping $1.00 then have it so that I'm willing to pay up to $0.98 to make the sweep go through first.
@_date: 2015-09-18 19:17:35
Yeah he really fucked everyone on that one. We could've had single payer if they just worked a little bit harder, the debate was open and the people were listening but instead of helping us he sold us out to the insurers. Those companies are leaches and we can recapture all the value they suck from the system by just going single payer and eliminating the need for a health insurer to exist.

Bitcoin is great and provides many benefits but in this type of transfer you don't really need any of those bitcoin benefits or key selling points. 
When people try to shoehorn bitcoin into a problem that doesn't need a bitcoin solution they often end up overpaying and being disappointed in the tech. Using bitcoin for this is like saying "I don't want to use Western Union to send money but I want to only use Microsoft shares; how can I do that?" The answer to that question is going to involve many steps and might lead you to saying " Microsoft shares are really difficult to use" When it wasn't the actual financial instruments fault but rather our fault for trying to Frankenstein together a solution where a better one already exists.
@_date: 2015-11-30 02:30:39
Oh man at that rate and amount you're better off just using Western Union. The hassle you will go through doing this in BTC is going to end up wasting time and money for both sides. With Western Union she just rolls into the store and collects her money, no hassle and no risk especially if its important that the money make it to her.

Exactly! People don't understand that it isn't Bitcoin that fluctuates but rather that the US dollar fluctuates. 1 BitCoint is always 1 BitCoin. The only time the conversion rate applies is when you leave or enter the bitCoin ecosystem. Once you own bitcoins you can just live on bitoins. Like a sandwich will always be some number of coins regardless of what the USD is at.

When buying in bulk they'll probably bid under market. Giving up that much USD at once has a price is expensive for the bidder since they're losing actual money and the bidder needs to make a profit when they slowly unload onto the market.
