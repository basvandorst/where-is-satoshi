what is wrong with people liking this crual insane tradition! 
he totally deserves to get his ass kicked. I just hope he isn't dead or something. and everybody watching and enjoying such event to kill a bull, are guilty as well. (in my eyes) 
ps. I have some family in Spain

supossed to be a gif �� something went wrong
@_date: 2019-07-13 18:00:20
I downloaded this gif that I saw online, and edited because trump tweeted.
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:55:23
part of my family is from Spain, Italy,...  but I hate the tradition of this animal cruelty behavior
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:53:30
in space, the black hole is the goal �� 
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:35:42
were you behind that scam? ��
@_date: 2018-09-28 21:25:38
as long enough nodes has a good copy of the ledger, you can always fix it? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:17:21
ok, IMAGINE WW3 is happening....
@_date: 2018-09-28 21:22:15
stupid question, sorry ��
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:15:16
exactly 
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:50:50
the ledger is stored on each node,
so how is he gonna do that?  lol
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:25:04
nice 
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:31:31
you're totally right, it's all about what people wants 
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:41:45
thanks for this great reply!
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:02:36
because the chain gets to heavy,  so if each node decompress, you could save size
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:42:15
did you invest in the worst period ever? 
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:00:14
I should test a lightning node as well (to learn) 
@_date: 2018-09-21 05:23:22
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:52:17
bitcoin becomes probably worthless too
@_date: 2018-09-28 21:33:41
 imagine,
you jump from the 20th floor.,
jump.  (till now, i'm fine)
19th floor, still fine.
18th floor, still fine
17th floor, still fine
... 
1st floor, still fine
BOEM  ���� 
is that a side effect ��
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:17:18
sooo supply and demand and négociation ��
Thanks, satisfying answer 
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:06:38
sorry that i'm stupid, wiseass ������
I'm just a factory worker
ps. it's just a tought experiment 
@_date: 2018-09-09 17:43:54
true, in the west, they think they don't need decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:29:40
hehe �� sorry dude
@_date: 2018-09-09 13:18:27
beautifully placed on the wall! 
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:43:35
yeah, true, the problem is, BTC is only for the tech people right now. most people don't have bitcoin. if most people don't want it, it becomes worthless too
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:25:55
who is gonna pay for a coffee in bitcoin? Unless you restock your bitcoin immediately, it can be a very expensive coffee. the market is to volatile today.  but what Starbucks is trying to do, is a step in the right direction. so more people who don't know bitcoin, will see that Starbucks accept bitcoin, so it's a good marketing strategy too. only I think very few people will use it. 
bitcoin should be a peer to peer digital cash system, but I agree that it behaves more as digital gold, a store of value.
Lightning network needs to change that! 
@_date: 2018-08-21 09:19:19
nice one ��
@_date: 2018-08-26 09:04:41
makes no sense,   check their age. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 08:46:39
the tech is there, but it will need almost a full generation for mass adoption. when internet and email existed, It needed also a long time before it went mainstream.
and you're right, there is gold everywhere. supernovi everywhere. maybe one day we can make gold in the lab with fusion  (or something) 
Bitcoin is better divisible than gold! and has only 21 million max supply. 
//I like to compare blockchain to internet. and email to bitcoin. becoz it's the closest analogy people understand (I guess) even the dotCom Bubble
vires in numeris
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:05:19
what happened with the white paper? peer to peer electronic cash system? 
@_date: 2018-10-15 17:45:46
It's because of tether that we see an inflated btc price. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:10:52
maybe the banking system should help in that for the regular people, who doesn't trust themselves. maybe each bank should become a crypto exchange with their infrastructure? 
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:08:05
thats what I think, but I hoped there is a way to somehow link your private key to something else without being less secure 
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:28:52
los pollos Hermanos ��
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:29:45
he forked the bitcoin blockchain last year in a unfriendly way. increasing the blocksize. claiming that bcash is the real bitcoin. very sad! he also owns the bitcoin dot com domain, pushing newbies into bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:24:04
by Satoshi, there are many people who now start to understand more about what money really is.
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:57:08
sorry lol,  sometimes my brain is freezing ��
@_date: 2018-10-13 11:19:22
I learned my 24words in a story, and never used it online. Also I have a drawing of that story in case I forget a word. Other people cant understand that drawing. But it can be destroyed in a fire. I shoud have a safe. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 13:26:50
where would you inplant it? �� you also need to be more careful how close you want to be with smart beautiful people ��
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:39:30
good point, a great testnet! 
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:00:30
this method is bad, if stolen 
@_date: 2018-10-14 08:12:10
got my 24 words in my head ��
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:44:09
not bad!  I hope your account never get compromised, so you don't need new rings ��
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:14:41
I remember with a technique.  and imagine a story, if the order isn't correct, it wouldnt make sense. person action, object memory technique involved. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:26:25
comment.awesome ++;
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:04:30
talking about it makes it a tiny less secure  ��
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:53:38
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:18:30
AWESOME,  a connection to a 'safe friend'  (Family) ������
@_date: 2018-10-13 16:09:43
is it safer spread your bitcoin utxo's on different adresses of the same private key?  to avoid having a bigger amount on a single adress ? 
@_date: 2018-10-13 15:24:27
So what, as long as we understand eachother.  only arrogant people respond this way. ��
@_date: 2019-08-04 11:34:13
what a cool story man ⚡��
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:42:25
bitmain, lol  I associate bitmain with BTC CASH SVABCDEF ��
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:26:00
you have no clue how the internet works, don't you? 
@_date: 2019-02-11 04:31:25
when BTC hits a million dollars,  you will remember it as your most expensive f ��
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:17:06
but asics are not so great for decentralization. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:56:45
asic manufacturers are profiting the most in this case 
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:51:53
also whatsapp, instagram,....
@_date: 2019-02-11 04:29:32
sounds awful... �� I prefer my belgian strong beer �� 
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:23:05
we had almost not enough energy to power belgium in December.  we had a disconnection plan in case we had shortage. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 04:49:46
karmeliet, duvel, Leffe, jupiler, brugse zot,.... 
@_date: 2019-02-11 05:22:29
Belgium has to many good beers to name everthing ����
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:33:49
in belgium, Electricity becomes more expensive each year 
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:19:09
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:15:27
you can actually connect to a satellite without the internet with a special setup. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:35:10
Andreas antonopolis is awesome ��
@_date: 2019-02-03 23:17:32
nope, it's without internet. you can look it up
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:39:27
I hate the fact that you need to mine in pools. It would be more decentralized if everybody could mine solo on your own laptop. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:06:26
Try  and you can play on the testnet
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:00:34
good point 
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:41:19
exactly,  crypto is still in its baby shoe's. Needs to muture. There is need for some smart contract to recover your lost private key using decentralized identity or something. BETTER secure user friendly wallets. Maybe some sort of DNS to deal with long adresses. 
We need good UX decentralized exchanges with atomic swaps.
So many things that need to improve. 
But Bitcoin and Ethereum will definitely change our future for the better. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:56:27
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:30:50
except december 2017 with astronomical high fee's 
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:15:50
once we have better batteries to store green energy, electricity price can become cheaper. Now we need to use this power immediately 
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:53:06
soon maybe pegged partially to BTC ��
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:32:07
1 dollar, is the best I can do ��
@_date: 2018-11-19 07:25:40
awesome++;  ��
@_date: 2019-01-25 13:48:27
coming with private jets and helicopters, then talk about climate change.... ��
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:53:20
holochain works like that,  where every node doesn't have a full copy of everything. It works like bittorrent, and they incentives seeders with a token or something. 
@_date: 2019-01-23 08:14:57
computers are sooooo stupid, that you. need to convert a problem as stupid as possible (simple) 
@_date: 2019-01-23 08:25:27
I am,  I just mean that computers are just binary,  and stupid. Every program needs to be written like you are trying to explain  to a dumb person (programming language)  what you want it to do.   just a quote ��
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:19:13
This is really awesome! You are right, these things are more important.
adoption, building awesome applications, scaling, education,.. The bear market is a good thing to eleminate bad actors and moonboys. And good projects survive a bear market much better. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:36:32
shrodingers computer is smart and stupid at the same time ��
@_date: 2019-01-23 07:51:00
First It needs to crash as low as possible, so I can buy some more at cheap prices.  I never invest what I can't afford to loose.  Need more time ��
@_date: 2019-01-27 10:24:03
I would ask him to teach me as much as possible. 
Then I build a half decentralized social media platform with a torrent based system to share media (not everthing needs to be on the blockchain) you can incentives seeders with ads money. (using btc or eth) no native token needed if we build on top of Ethereum.  I would use decentralized identity, so no more user names and passwords.  important stuff like followers, likes, transactions can come on the blockchain.
The UX must be fast and user-friendly as much as possible.  If it can't all be done on second layer, it needs a blockchain with PoS.  It needs to be fast.  Social media doesn't need a bulletproof over the top PoW hashing power ��
it's just an idea �� ✌️
@_date: 2019-01-23 08:55:31
yeah true. 
damn, my post is flagged... in case you like science, coding, quotes and memes ect.   at Instagram,.... ��
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:35:27
if you have your 12 mnemonic words, you can import it in almost every wallet.  ✌️
But then it makes it less secure. Because you expose your 12 words for a moment. You better use a hardware wallet. It's also compatible with mycelium. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:34:51
maybe by then, the price is so high that miners can survive solo on Transaction fee's, Or we updated it by consensus. who knows.  (with a split to bitcoin abcdefSV 3.0)  ��
