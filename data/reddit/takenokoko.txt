Very cool! I've been on a Koryo Tour before (although it was at a time before bitcoins existed). Say hello to Simon for me :)

Ten posts were enough... 100 posts ago.

"[...]as investors realize that it cannot be used as collateral in financial transactions and its principal utility is for illegal business dealings where anonymity is important."
It's been five years and they haven't realized this, so why start now?

Issue pink coins. Women like pink stuff, right?

Good to see that finance expert Rosanne Barr is onboard.

I agree. It's easy to call posts like these "delusional" and self-congratulatory, but bitcoin, whether it ultimately succeeds or not, is an innovative technology and such things are developed by smart, ambitious people and likewise the early adopters tend to belong to a similar group. 
The reason poor countries are not leading the way for new technologies is because... they're full of poor, uneducated people. It's kind of common sense, but let's face it, we're probably not going to see the next game changer spring forth from Sudan.
Make no mistake, even if bitcoin becomes the world's dominant currency (highly doubt it) wealth disparities will remain. Life is essentially one big competition and the best and brightest tend to rise to the top.

They're just saying no because they want to buy all those cheap coins before whales like you. Go for it!! What could possibly go wrong?

Until you find a cold storage solution, at least enable 2FA (2 Factor Authentication) on your Coinbase account. And on your linked e-mail address to be extra careful, and make sure to disable the API for CB (disabled by default). At that point, the coins should be relatively safe. Too many sob stories online from people who didn't take these steps.

Honestly, why spend them if their value keeps going up? I'd much rather spend cash, which slowly decreases in value. The only benefit I see of purchasing goods or services with BTC right now is to dodge taxes.

Many people have gone through troubles like this with BTC-E and other exchanges. Likely your wire is being held by their bank but will get released eventually. I'm sure it's frustrating in the meantime. Why not use a site like Coinbase? People complain about them all the time as well, but their instant buy function works quite well and much less stressful than international wires.

Or he'll see it in 20 years and think, "what the hell is bitcoin?" and then look it up on wikipedia and laugh :)

"Now, in order to get that amount of a return, you must "save" the money in stocks/bonds/mutual funds/etc - which as we learned in 2008, is not a very safe store of value."
At least you don't risk having your stocks "erased" or stolen by a hacker. The stock market has historically returned an annual rate of 8% to investors. Anyone who wasn't a moron and held their portfolio has long since recovered their investment and much more.

I supersize with you as well, but I imagine Coinbase will *eventually* get this sorted out. On the bright side, maybe bitcoin will raise 5x in value before that happens and when you finally do get access to your coins you'll be rich. I kind of wish someone had held my coins hostage during some of the previous run ups. lol. But seriously, hope everything works out for you.

Old rich white dudes warning young (hope to be) rich white dudes? I'm pretty sure this is racist, somehow. Let me consult with my team.

I don't consider charging fees a form of theft; every exchange in the world charges fees, otherwise they wouldn't make any money. And surely not all bitcoin exchanges exist for the sole purpose of running off with customer funds. Sites such as Gox, BTC-E, and Bitstamp must be making a killing every day off fees alone... why kill a great thing for a one time payday? 
It wouldn't decrease profits if they charged customers for the policy overhead. If a legitimate insurance provider stepped in and offered a policy in the case that an exchange closed or was victim of a hack, I'd gladly sign up. It's a big *if* though.
Every bank is insured. Eventually this will need to happen if bitcoin is to someday grow beyond a small niche community.

Too many people come on here and ask the same damned questions over and over. Like, "Is it worth it to mine bitcoin on my laptop?" or "Why is the price higher on MtGox?" They deserve ridicule for not doing a simple search.
I do agree that r/bitcoin serves as an echo chamber and the hostility toward critical opinions is uncalled for.
