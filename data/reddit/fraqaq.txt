Lambos for all of us, confirmed
@_date: 2019-07-31 07:06:50
Starting the day off already over 9.8k! I think we could definitely see 10k shortly! Feeling BULLISH!

the best time to plant a tree is always right now
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:04:37
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:15:29
we could see 15k in the next 2 days
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:27:02
Does trump have the power to outlaw usage of crypto currencies in the us?
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:47:15
no look at the year long chart instead of the day-to-day

Indestructible, faster than the speed of light(Ning) and can see through people’s bullshit. Also the government hates it.

didnt have that much money back then, got a new job, started saving now I can invest.
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:31:43
it'll cost more than that in energy to even mine one in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:48:56
Why do you want to sell? Do you not want to go to the moon?
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:53:53
Lmao can you imagine the fools who sold at 9100 when it dipped and then 2 minutes later it goes back to 9500
@_date: 2019-07-16 20:15:18
Wow what a gift you have, buying at the top lol
@_date: 2019-07-18 00:15:40
is gemini a safe ios wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-22 05:06:23
I like where this is going. currently stable at 10.5k  the hodlers outweigh the shorters. next stop, 1 million.
@_date: 2019-07-23 02:21:43
76k next month mark my words
@_date: 2019-07-11 01:28:34
Dude wtf are you talking about, it swings a grand either way every day. We’re still up 50% for the month. Fuck outta here you don’t know shit about bitcoin all you are is a sore looser who bought at the top (prob with less than a hundred bucks) and complains everyday on this subreddit.
@_date: 2019-07-31 04:48:36
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:42:13
What you got a 100 bucks in and now you have 60 after a year. Do us all a favor, sell your bitcoin and leave this subreddit for good no one cares about your opinion, all you’ve done is lose.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:44:51

@_date: 2019-07-29 04:27:57

@_date: 2019-07-22 22:17:24
Only buy, never sell.
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:52:33
so the graph is predicting it bottoms out at 8500?
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:56:19
The reason it’s worth more is for the reason you just mentioned... there’s a small supply! It’s called supply and demand Econ 101 scarcity sells.
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:57:06
What I mean is that I feel like more people think it’s going to go up than down in the long run.
@_date: 2019-07-26 02:56:59
I bought today and yesterday, even the day before yesterday. Would you believe that.
@_date: 2019-07-19 02:47:59
Look at the year-to-year charts instead of the day-to-day. More people know about bitcoin than ever before. No one can be positive about anything in the future, but I sure hope it goes up and I think a lot of people think just like me which will make it happen.
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:32:25
You’re clearly an ether shill, I wish you the best with that. Also something that’s Interesting to know is bitcoin is 40x the value of what you invested in.
@_date: 2019-07-26 02:42:08
Damn you

@_date: 2019-07-21 06:25:57
one day you're going to sell at 12.5 and it'll never go that low again leaving you at a loss (if you buy back in) . just hodl.
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:29:02
What’s wrong with cash app?
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:11:30
Yes think of it. It’s been around for 10 years and the name has become synonymous with crypto
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:49:54
hell yah man good things are coming
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:42:02
It’s not going to go that low in a long time or never
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:26:58
This tweet should make bitcoin skyrocket, but hasn’t yet. Must be soon. The reasons trump wants to inflate the dollar is so his property values go up because they are a hedge against inflation. It’s a cash grab from wealthy property owners like trump who want to get as much as they can from the American people before he’s out of office. As an investor in bitcoin strangely I support this.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:24:06
You don’t.
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:41:39
The only thing I’m dumping is more money into bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-10 01:41:19
I feel like there was probably a bunch of people who had a sell order at 13k which is why it dipped 100 and started bouncing back to 13
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:53:32
Just wait until the Asian bulls wake up. A tsunami is coming, we will be the few who knew.
@_date: 2019-07-22 03:33:39
My best advice for you would be to ask for more hours at work and not put any money in crypto if you are short on bills.

Honestly as someone who frequents this sub, I think I speak for everyone on this sub when I say **Just Leave**. Looking at your comment history it’s clear other things in your life contribute to your pessimistic outlook on life. Every comment you make on this subreddit is negative, if you don’t have something nice to say don’t say it at all.
@_date: 2019-07-04 07:04:43
Some people shouldn’t even be in this game. When the price hits 12000 everyone’s posting stuff about going to the moon and lambos, when it drops to 11000 everyone says “it’s plummeting, time to sell.” Even when it’s still up 10% for the day and even higher for the month. Some of y’all need to chill the fuck out and stop looking at the price so much, me included.
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:22:14
The best piece of advice is to do the exact opposite of whatever u/sfxnyc does. This guy bought at the worst time possible and whines about how terrible his life is all day.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:54:46
“The president of the United States- Donald Trump tweeted about bitcoin.” Imagine saying that to someone 10 years ago. They’d think you were insane!
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:42:54
It’s your money man, personally I’d go 50/50 if I was you but you do you.
@_date: 2019-07-17 06:34:31
when you get even on the total amount you invested in the price of bitcoin will be your average

@_date: 2019-08-21 14:44:42
Higher lows, Higher Highs.

For someone who’s so pessimistic about bitcoin you sure spend a lot of time on this sub.
@_date: 2019-08-07 22:03:53
Just a bunch of losers selling for a quick buck. Fine by me, let them hop off the train and get reckt.
@_date: 2019-08-17 03:46:09
you have to pay taxes on any gains if you sell
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:11:12
I was telling that is you
@_date: 2019-08-23 07:04:13
16k October looking more and more plausible each day.
@_date: 2019-08-10 05:00:32
Believe it or not, now is a great time to buy bitcoin. When we hit 6 figures you will wish you bought more now.
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:02:54
Is this real life?
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:04:07
Its what do you expect
@_date: 2019-08-17 03:50:09
its an online form from the exchange. you get it at the beginning of the year which will explain everything to you.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:59:52
He only has 100 dollars in bitcoin yet talks about how much money he’s lost everyday. He also bought at 19k.
@_date: 2019-08-15 01:41:15
If you’re not in it for the long run then hop off the train. There’s a reason they call it the 1% because only a very small amount of people see the big picture and have strong hands. Me personally I don’t care if bitcoin goes straight to the ground, I’ll be like a captain going down with my ship. Do I think that will happen? NO. If it does then oh well, I gave it a shot. Strength grows when you think you can’t go on but do so anyways. HODL on my friends! Buckle up this is going to be a wild ride! In time we will meet in the CITADEL.
@_date: 2019-08-07 07:32:11
I'm so hyped I just read the entire bitcoin whitepaper.

@_date: 2019-08-14 03:27:04
If you think it’s going to 8k then why didn’t you sell when we hit 12k?
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:08:25
This literally is a thread with you responding to "insults" with both of your accounts. lol now thats funny.
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:55:21
this is for anyone that doesn't know already. Same guy that said we were going to 8k guaranteed based off his "own intuition" now hes bullish lmao. make up your mind dude.
@_date: 2019-08-17 03:47:34
no. just don't sell you'll be better off in the long run.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:55:04

@_date: 2019-08-07 07:46:16

You only loose when you sell. If you were planning on hodling for years to come this means nothing.

Question about ledger wallets/litecoin(I know it’s probably shit but I have some regardless) wondering if someone could help answer. Do I need to create a new passphrase for litecoin or do I just send it to ledger live?
@_date: 2019-08-07 01:26:28
If it doesn’t look good then sell your bitcoin and get off this sub. You only have a hundred bucks in anyways that’s chump change compared to what some of us got in this, yet you think you can give people financial advice based on your “own intuition” you also go on the pics sub and talk shit about weed for hours on end. You gotta be kidding me, grow up, leave this sub or stay the laughing stock. Your choice.
@_date: 2019-08-09 21:33:52
It’s so nice watching shitcoins die. Pretty soon we will be at 90% market cap then total collapse of shitcoins will happen.
@_date: 2019-08-08 17:18:38
Good time to buy.

@_date: 2019-08-17 04:11:47
missing the whole point about bitcoin is that you are your own bank and you dont trust some institution to handle your money.

yah lol what does he have to do with whales?
@_date: 2019-08-07 03:53:16
Whale or not, when we started going over 12k I was loosing it. Holy shit what a feeling.
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:59:19
Just use cash app.
@_date: 2019-08-17 04:00:23

If I trade my lite coins for bitcoin on Coinbase is that a taxable event that I need to report to the irs? Should I just wait to see what happens after the halving in 3 days?

We won’t be around in 120 years.

Depends what you consider “moon” I think the prophecy is most likely right. 16k by October.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:14:00
Thank you! One more question... If I don’t move it out of the app would I still have to pay taxes on gains/losses this year or would keeping it in the market make that not so?
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:27:15
Suit yourself, may not see prices like this ever again. Don’t say I didn’t warn ya.
@_date: 2019-06-29 03:48:15
checked his twitter, music was copyrighted said he'll reupload soon and ill post the link
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:18:33
Nothing to see here, just a whale trying to dictate the market. Don’t be fooled by these silly moves. Remember we’re up 60%+ from the beginning of the year. Every day that goes by is another day bitcoin is a proven system that works. The hash rate increases and the amount of people who learn about bitcoin grows substantially. A couple days ago we were talking about how this sub reached 1.1 million subscribers, since then we’ve added another 16k. Have faith in bitcoin, it’s been around for 10 years and will continue to be around as long as the internet exists.
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:21:41
You’re a clown.
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:33:36
Anyone else stacking sats? Been buying like crazy at 8k
@_date: 2019-10-31 22:46:12
Ready for all this Halloween drunk buys? Because I am!
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:37:52
its kind of crazy to think that whoever sold earlier today (the whale) literally could take 10 billion off the market cap. Did they sell 10 billion in bitcoin like holy shit?

@_date: 2019-12-24 23:09:59
Blocks were mined much faster when bitcoin was new and difficulty was low. This lowered the amount of time until the first halvening.
@_date: 2019-12-21 08:03:57
Bought more bitcoin today :)

Get rid of that crap. I bought litecoin when it was 80 dollars then it dropped to 70 I converted to bitcoin and only suffered a 30% loss compared to more than 50%
