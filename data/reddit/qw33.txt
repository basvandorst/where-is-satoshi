Robinhood's model is to batch all purchases into a single purchase instead of executing market trades.  So instead of 100 people paying 100 fees, its 1 fee for 100 people and robinhood eats the cost.  They balance the cost with their higher paid tier service.
So using this model, yes they could do BTC transfers with no fees.  Just don't expect it to be instant.

Xmas is just asians mimicking western holidays.  Its like americans celebrating st pattys.  In my family, its not a serious thing at all.  We give each other shitty $20 gifts if any are given and we eat asian food instead of some traditional xmas meal like ham.  So I could see them giving crypto to each other here.
But lunar holiday is serious shit.  The tradition is to give cold hard cash in little red envelopes and adults get a degree of pleasure showing off how much they're giving when a kid can feel the heft of the money without opening the envelope and its not in $1s.  Also its in new crisp bills.  So unless crypto can be sized to the size of money and smell and weigh like money, I don't see it ever happening.
Also I wish lunar holidays were as cheap as xmas.  Its expected that adult couples give cash to every kid and asians have huge families, 3-5 siblings each.  Even when I just started working, I pressured into giving $100s of dollars to the younger kids down to babies, around several grand in total and was about 3-5 months of savings.  
And thats before the higher ranking adults have to throw huge dinners.  I'm getting to the age where its my turn, and I know these things cost around $2k-$10k USD each.
I forget to mention there is a degree of gift giving before the holiday itself in the form of moon cakes.  Although this cost isn't as high as the other mentioned, these single cakes run to about $20 for one that's about the size of your palm.  And people don't normally just gift one.  Usually comes in a pack of 4.

This is how news has always been.  Its the oldest form of influencer marketing.  Its no different than starbucks paying kim kardiashian to take instagram pics of holding one of their cups.

No, they make a lot more money being paid to push certain topics.  'Eyeball money' is a lot of bullshit and risk.  Since no article is guaranteed to get those eyeballs.  But if someone paid that writer $10k to write an article.  That's hard cash in hand.

If your target is 10%-20% growth you'd be better off with an index fund.  Last year's returns were 25% for vanguard and I wouldn't be surprised at 30-40% this year.

In my experience, its doesn't take much to sway a content creators (writer) or content presenter (anchor's) opinion to your side.  Asking a friend the biz to put in a good word for you or outright paying them.  These aren't exactly official business channels where there's a contract saying I'm going to pay CNN $10,000 to pitch my products and present it as regular news.
Most news on TV isn't really news, its entertainment.  
I mean, politicians aren't supposed to take money for passing laws / regulation favorable to certain businesses.  But we all know some of them in are in somebody's pocket.  No industry is going to be 100% clean.

This is the first year with tax cuts.  Last year was not and it was nearing 30% already in some quarters.
For the next few years, it will be 30%+.  10 years?  Maybe not.  But if someone was just looking for ~15%ish return, then index funds will deliver with less risk.  If anything, at least much less fud.  Not everyone can stomach this daily doom and gloom news and wild swings.  If someone wants a lambo, then crypto is the better bet, but of course that comes with more risk.
As I'm typing this btc is $9100.
