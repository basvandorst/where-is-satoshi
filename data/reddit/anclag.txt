I've seen a lot of people saying numbers like 100,000 and 1,000,000 for BTC, but is anyone with a history of accurate predictions saying these numbers?
Did anyone predict 10,000 by the end of November?

I've seen lots of discussion about how long it takes for a bitcoin transaction to go through, which I believe is round about 10 mins...how do exchanges like coinbase work then since I can make an instantaneous purchase?
How can I watch GDAX scrolling by and buy/sell orders happening as soon as the price rises/falls?

That makes sense, thanks...I guess this is why so many people insist on having their own wallet as well then!

Been using revolut for travelling for over a year now and no regrets... this could be huge!
£6.99/month is a bit steep for what the premium card gets you, but if anyone is planning on signing up for the basic one (which will have access to their crypto trading soon), then drop me a message for my invite code (so I can unlock it myself now!)

Also, just reading their blog post about it at  , they say your money in crypto isn't yet safeguarded like the other currencies you hold with them, so there's extra risk involved...

Yeah it's weird, if you go to the buying/selling tab on coinbase though they give you a more accurate figure, I'm just ignoring the dashboard figures on there just now
