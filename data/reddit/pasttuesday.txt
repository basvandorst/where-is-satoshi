The regulated amount accounts for children. The amount that is in your public water is .7 to 1.2 ppm. This is a very low dose and studies have shown combined with fluoride toothpaste, prevents cavities. Essentially, fluoride works in 3 ways -
Remineralizing enamel
Reducing its solubility (acids in food and produced by bacteria break down teeth)
Disrupting bacterial growth
It is important to monitor how much toothpaste a child is using and making sure they are not eating it, but isn't this the case with many things around your house? 
If I were to analyze the ingredients in your toothpaste, just looking at the label I know that ginger when applied to the skin for some people causes irritation. Ginger also when taken orally has been shown to cause a significant risk of bleeding. 
So is the risk worth it? A child would have to eat a significant amount of tooth paste to cause symptoms of fluorosis. On the other hand, the bacteria species which cause cavities will always be in their mouth whether they eat "well and organic" or not. 
Anyway, there is a lot of science done by many entities out there. You can skew it however you like, but in the end, Dentists and governments aren't conspiring to kill your kids with fluoride.

If you go back and read the thread, I've only talked about the science behind why you choose certain fillings over others. If you don't wanna talk about the facts, then I don't know what type of discussion you're trying to start here.

4th year dental student here.
Two things worry me about this toothpaste:
How abrasive is it? Just brushing too hard or with improper technique can cause abrasions along the gumline. Many of the patients I see I end up restoring over exposed dentin in this area because of the caries risk from overbrushing or because they are brushing with hard bristles. Even with commercial toothpastes approved by the ADA, there are disparities of grit sizes. If using a powered toothbrush, this grit factor becomes significant.
There are no fluoride containing compounds in the toothpaste. Caries risk is significantly reduced when brushing with fluoride containing toothpastes.
 If you decide to buy the toothpaste here, consider buying a fluoride mouthwash to go with it.
@_date: 2014-08-11 04:11:12
I've read more papers on fluoride than I care to recall - you'll find that the ADA and most dental schools follow evidence-based treatment rather than "standard college curriculums". As a dental student, I spend 11 hours a day in a clinic either working on patients with supervising practicing dentists, or, well, doing research. 
Both of these sources you've cited are about overdosing on fluoride , which does not equate to "fluoride found in toothpaste is extremely dangerous" as you state. There is an overwhelming amount of research about the correlation between fluoride treatment and caries prevention. 
The meta analysis you linked has actually been criticized for having confounding variables. For example, in some of the studies fluoride exposure came from the burning of high fluoride content coal, and used a control group from an area in which wood was used as fuel.
(Sabour S, Ghorbani Z (March 2013). "Developmental fluoride neurotoxicity: clinical importance versus statistical significance". Environ. Health Perspect. 121 (3): A70.)
And the second study, well, yes, dental fluorosis is a very real thing, it's not an amazing new disease that your dentist doesn't know, in fact he can spot your history of fluorosis on your teeth if you had it a young age. This is why the fluoride in your water is regulated, and the fluoride in your toothpaste and mouthwashes are regulated. This is also why you don't eat or drink your toothpaste and mouthwashes.
I'm sorry you had so many cavities, and I'm glad you changed your diet and it's helped you. Thank you for sharing your creation with reddit, and supporting the bitcoin community, I just couldn't sit on the sidelines though and let more redditors lose their teeth after reading about so many horror stories here. 
TL:DR - If you use this 10 dollar toothpaste, spend 4 bucks buying a fluoride mouthwash as well. Also, unless we know the coarseness of the grit, don't use this toothpaste with an electric brush.

Actually amalgam has been re-formulated many times since a century ago. The plastics we have aren't up to par yet in terms of it's ability to withstand compressive force. You don't seem to know much except "technology has improved, therefore materials must have improved."
That being said, I love working with composite resin much more than amalgam. I'm not really trying to defend anything, just upset with armchair medicine which you seem to be doing as well. There are also other variables we can consider. Have you considered that there is bisphenol-a in our plastics "of the 21st" century? I'm rambling, but you made a pretty vague statement, and this is my vague response.
@_date: 2014-07-13 21:15:14
4th year dental student here. These additives may have some bacterial control elements, but they are lacking in one thing which helps strengthen your teeth against bacterial acid: fluoride. I wouldn't recommend this over store bought tooth paste. Anecdotal evidence is that those of my patients who use "natural" tooth pastes are always baffled as to why they have cavities despite brushing often. After looking through his research articles, look up fluorides effect on  remineralizing teeth and make your own informed decision.

So what are they modifying? Wasnt the 1 mb cap placed temporarily? Wouldn't removing this temporary cap be more aligned with the original vision for bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:15:18
I've read that satoshi wasn't a mathematical genius but rather a genius with incentives. Bitcoin already has incentives built in so that miners interest align with bitcoin interests. It's hard to buy that miners who have so much capital in bitcoin (and its not like they just hold bitcoin and can liquidate, rather they own the actually machinery that's useless unless it's securing bitcoin) would want to harm bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:01:51
Having a small percentage of your amalgam filling in your tooth is not going to affect you - what they're more concerned about is the placement and removal of the filling as this is when you are most exposed. 
As far as other alternatives - resin composite fillings (the white ones) are getting better and better, but they still require a very dry field when placing. If it's in an area that the dentist is unable to keep completely dry due to the patient's tongue, salivary ducts, or mouth movements when placing, the filling may come out or fail, or the margins may not be sealed etc. In this situation, an amalgam filling may be more appropriate. Other factors where amalgam is better is if you're grinding your teeth at night etc. Sometimes if a restoration fractures (which is less likely with amalgam) you may lose the tooth because of inadequate tooth structure left or because there is a cavity encroaching on the nerve etc. These materials are chosen for a reason and by being an armchair dentist telling people what they should be choosing because of "common sense" is not helping the community.

ethereum is hitting scalability from tons of different angles, raiden, plasma, state channels, etc.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:46:08
They don't. Bitcoin is unique in that it had a scaling debate and the fallout is this mess. They're hoping for layer 2 solutions in the future which means transactions will be written to the blockchain in bulk. Bitcoin is limited to only 1 mb blocks currently and this is still in contention. Meanwhile, an offshoot of the bitcoin main chain called bitcoin cash exists and already does 8 mb blocks. Another crypto called ethereum is trying to build much more. I was a longtime bitcoin owner and have changed all my bitcoin for ethereum. Check out to see the foil to and check out for a glimpse into what the web 3 will look like. The web 3 is already being supported by big companies like Microsoft Toyota Samsung and many more.

I was going to do visa but bovado has a 6 percent fee and I thought that was pretty high so I chose bitcoin for the deposit.

@_date: 2017-08-06 22:43:40
Yes, and it's very promising. JP morgan, samsung, toyota, state street, mastercard are among those using ethereum to build smart contracts with. Detractors say they are using their private ethereum chain, but that's the point - build on private chains interoperable w/ public. Intranet connected via internet. Check out the enterprise ethereum alliance: 
Smart contracts on bitcoin are indeed a possibility but many institutions avoid bitcoin. In addition bitcoin is already far behind ethereum in the smart contract space - look at the corporations already building upon the ethereum protocol. First mover advantage has already been set.
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:18:36
yes, just as easy as buying. you lose on fees, but they aren't huge. just hit sell and itll be back in your bank account 3-5 days. i was definitely buying while i was a student, and sometimes due to poor budgeting i'd have to sell, but it's not any different than cashing out of venmo or paypal or something.

Crazy speculation
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:40:33
ethereum is based off smart contracts, and smart contracts can hold money. so for example, for the mayweather/mcgregor fight, i wanted to bet on mayweather, so someone created a smart contract that anyone could deposit money into, and it would pay out according to the odds based off another website. I'd just send my eth to a certain address, and once the fight was done, the contract would pull the results and pay out accordingly. No middle man required. Imagine how useful this could be for any corporation that's ever existed. It would eliminate so many man hours and existing departments. check out the enterprise ethereum alliance, such names as microsoft, samsung, toyota, dtcc (1.7 trillion securities trading in a year), and most recently a group of law firms, many with revenues of over a billion have joined. There are over 100 businesses in the alliance. 
In addition, many of the top cryptos you see are based off the ethereum chain. on ethereum, you can create tokens like any other crypto, but it will be backed by the security of the main ethereum chain. imagine you could tap into the existing network of bitcoin and all the miners were suddenly securing your token too. and as your token increases in value, so does ethereum, as ethereum is what propels these tokens through the system - thats why they call ethereum the oil or gas, vs bitcoins gold.
@_date: 2016-12-08 00:54:29

This is exactly why I got into alts. The community contributes toxic shit like this. I don't care which side you're on but this isn't pleasant to read.

First quote in the first article is him saying that his opinion on scaling is nuanced and it changes.

Bitcoin community has become so toxic.

Is ripple supposed to replace swift?

Can't believe the comments in here. Dell stopped taking bitcoin today due to it being too error prone. A currency that involves guesswork is insane. 
This sub rejoiced when dell accepted bitcoin and I'm sure the rest of you who still show up in the comments (i.e. Unremoved) will do mental gymnastics to rationalize how this is fine.

This is so wrong - the transaction price for eth is hyperinflated for the ICOs. People have sent like 20+ eth as the transaction fee to get in first to buy.

And one day you will realize that gold is irreplaceable and bitcoin is replaceable

When btc drops all Alta have been dropping. Think people will jump to litecoin instead of fiat?
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:12:07
Heard this about eth during presale here which deterred me from buying

everytime i see UASF its like bold and lots of caps and stuff. makes me thinking of MAGA

What's the difference between a cryptocurrency and an altcoin?

Beyond the gate is the moon. Bitcoin are the people. The gate is blockstream.

Fee to transact not fee to buy
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:59:54
are we talking blockchain size or transaction limit
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:56:17
people would find a way with other cryptos
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:59:23
Haha. Yep it's all Jihans fault. For two years he's held us down. He's forced Gavin and Mike to quit so he could take in high fees and he doesn't really want those asics anyway. It's cold where he lives and he was in this for room warmers.

just looking at daily transactions eth highest was ~220k and bitcoin about 330k
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:10:41
There was very little doomsday talk I remember. Most forecasted a jump in price. Lots were just correcting people on the difference between half the supply vs half the increase in supply and how that would affect price. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:41:12
bitcoins fees are high because you want to send a transaction and want it to actually go through before it's kicked out in 14 days. ethereum fees are still very low for these types of transactions. people are sending VERY high fees (thousands of dollars) to get in first with ICO. The average of all the low fees plus these very high fees is the average that we're talking about.
thats wut.

bitcoin is still inflationary for the foreseeable future, eth is consumed as a commodity so the inflation is necessary. do some reading man
@_date: 2017-06-09 04:40:38
the way an ICO is working currently is they announce the block in which the sales start. Everyone tries to get in on that block as quickly as possible. fees drop after the ICO ends, usually after a certain amount of eth is gathered.

didnt know if you know but that's the original acronym. MBGA - make britain great again. which is much more poignant. Trump stole the saying. 
really though - bitcoin was already great - now it's crippled.

Maybe stagnation for years is enough to bring it down, maybe it can take a few more years. Who knows. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:31:35
don't get brainwashed. look at all the cryptos. read about them. see their value. don't miss out on this once in a lifetime adoption of new tech.
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:17:41
thats the trend - people start off loving bitcoin, use it, and now they don't like using it. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:21:24
true story. no sarcasm.
@_date: 2017-06-11 07:00:14
this is the problem - bitcoin is poised to become huge right now. so many new people wanting to get onboard but once they get the user experience, well, we'll see what happens but the current trend is not good. and if they're still thirsty for cryptos? just read all the current headlines in the news - ethereum is eating bitcoin's lunch. after trying bitcoin, theyll jump ship. and after enough jump ship and the flippening actually happens? eth didnt set out to be a currency but the currency part of bitcoin already works better on ethereum.

Bitsquare traded 2 bitcoin today. Two.

a quote from BC-LC "holding ETC is for the most patient of hands. just keep holding, and payday will come." Also, check out his comment history, quite a lot, skewed perspective, redditor for 1 week.
