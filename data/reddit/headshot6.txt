Both the BTC and ETH have simply dropped a bit in value since you bought these currencies. When they appreciate in value, you will get more $ for them. So technically speaking, yes, you are already losing money. Although, nothing is won or lost until you decide to sell your positions.

Well, in that case, your money is gone forever.

Well, I chose to disregard this chart and went ahead to buy 2 bitcoins at £1,713 (pretending £ was $). I feel good.

Blocks are running out of capacity and it takes longer to get confirmations. 4 hours isn't even that bad nowadays, although my today's transactions were confirmed within an hour or so.

Agree with this 100%. It's actually quite obvious if you think of it. I'd go as far as 1 BTC = $1M in a few years time.

Of course they’re there to make money, just like a standard fiat ATM generates money for its owner by charging a withdrawal fee. 
The difference is that a random Bitcoin ATM gets public exposure and increases brand awareness that’s much appreciated. 
I never walked into that shop, but the poster itself is doing a great job as it is seen by thousands of people every day.

Sorry mate, it's not about buying or selling it :)

The article is kinda biased toward bitcoin unlimited. What is it doing here?!
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:37:59
Buy low sell high they say, nothing wrong with that ;)
