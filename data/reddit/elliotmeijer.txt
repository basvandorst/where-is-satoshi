This is probably the biggest success of bitcoin and the reason other “decentralized” cryptocurrencies will fail.

I can’t stand Roger anymore. Just the sound of his whining voice makes me cringe

I thought bitcoin has a bad influence on the environment
@_date: 2019-06-16 20:17:36
As a matter of fact I bought a several ASIC miners. Saying it was unprofitable is an understatement.

Bitcoin is the future but not with POW consensus. There are way less wasteful ways to secure the network. It shouldn’t be compared with banks at all. It should be something completely different.

The lifelong contracts got me. Receiving daily bitcoin income without having to bare the noise of miners and electricity bills sounded like a good investment at the time.

I like how Bitcoin is portrait as a green flower while actually being extremely wasteful.

I did that. They are currently assembling dust in the garage.

I get the contract stated ABC but instead of postponing wasteful mining power waiting for more profitable times they just let our contracts get “liquidated” during the bear market. An egoistic self serving trash company.

I’ve had a few rough days and a reset in my life is foreseeable. This comment had more content in it than 4 different advices I received the past 48 hours.
I don’t believe in coincidences

I remember that hack. The hosting company got hacked not LiteBit. Which they changed ofc.

Mature and funny.

For the sake of everything. Delete.

Seen it and haven’t thought of it like it. Good example
@_date: 2018-07-07 16:45:13
Take it from someone who invested and lost allot of money on miners. Don’t do it. The difficulty is exploding and the profit you think of making won’t be nearly as high as you expect. 
A year ago I bought 1 L3 and made a very good return. Decided adding dozen machines end of the year and leave alone having any ROI I’m losing money having them on.

In other words, I won't have to do anything and receive the fork?
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:58:46
You made me unexpectedly blow a little air out of my nose with that comment ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:58:35
That doesn’t mean you always have to pay for something.
@_date: 2018-12-03 22:29:28
Most probably. But not all of them are scams. Just start ups with cool concepts that will probably fail and never see adaptation and soft exit within three  years of paring funding down the drain and paying themselves ultra bonuses, salaries and vacation times.

Take 100$ and take off 10%
Smart! 
Now add 10%
You just lost 1 dollar.
