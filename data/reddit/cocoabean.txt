Reread your comment a few times and think about it.

Fuck me, but, why would you transfer 10,000 USD of anything to some random company without testing the waters with smaller amounts?

I don't see any disagreement other than the misleading title. SCOTUS is the final word, not the Internet.

A show with people arguing that ends with a request for comments. Redditors would be watching this if it were 1987.

They didn't say money is free speech. They ruled that corporations were allowed to spend money on "electioneering communication". So it's more like the act of spending money to disseminate speech (in this case it was a movie critical of Hilary Clinton) is protected by the first amendment. The court struck down part of a law that could have prevented Citizens United from airing the movie about Hilary within 30 days of an election. IANAL but IIRC they ruled that just the fact that the law on its face might *seem* to restrict legal speech is justification to rule it unconstitutional for having a "chilling effect" on free speech.

It's hard to say, it changes fast. Saw a relatively large jump in the last few days, 20 dollars or so. Get on the exchange and watch trades, checkout the charts for history.
@_date: 2015-02-16 22:04:33
You can if you want, but someone has to be willing to buy what you want to sell.
@_date: 2015-02-16 01:38:09
There are buy orders and sell orders. If you put in an order and it matches an existing order, you're taking liquidity out. If you put in an order, and someone else then puts in an order at it matches yours, you're putting liquidity in. You only pay a fee if you take liquidity out ( but that doesn't start until April 1st).
Please note, I'm pretty sure this is how it works, but I could be wrong. The documentation on the site can be hard to understand at times.
Seems to make sense though, by making an unfilled order you're providing a buy/sell option for someone. By matching an existing order you're taking that offer off of the table.

I made a buck or so on the jump last night. I only put like $30 dollars into my account. I use Coinbase and their exchange.
*There's a 1% fee on coins you buy from Coinbase, so I really bought $29.70 worth of coin plus the $.30 fee. I just entered $30.00, they make it out so that with the fee it ends up being what you entered.
There's no exchange fees up until March 30th so you can pull it in and out of the market as you wish. Come April, if you take liquidity out of the market you'll be charged a .25% fee. Just remember that 1% fee when you sell, since you need an increase of at least 1% to just break even.
I recommend starting small so you can get a feel for how their trading interface works. Let me know if you have any questions.
