Thank you for your complete answer !
So, I need to trust the Ledger Company at different levels and it is difficult to check the security. For example, I can verify the code on github, but even I was a security expert, how to be sure that it is the code compiled on google store ?
You wrote :
"At some point unfortunately, as hardware is involved, you have to trust something (either the chip vendor, or the supply chain, or ...) - we try to provide a wide number of mechanisms and use secure chips to reduce the scope of what you need to trust."
I totally agree with that, but it is a big problem when we are dealing with money. I trust my bank because it is big, it exists for  decades and I know that I can attack her in case of problems. With a young company like ledger (or Trezor), it is really difficult to know if we can trust you.
I don't have many bitcoins, so I don't worry too much, but I would like to know how the legendary holders (and non security experts) feels when they puts hundreds of bitcoins on a USB wallet...

What proves that ? 
- is the chrome application secure ?  What proves me that there isn t any backdoor ? 
- is the hardware secure : is it possible to download the datas stored on it and brute force it ? 
- is the entropy of the passphrase that generated the private key strong enough ? 
In general,  what if a ledger developper wrote some back door code ? 
How to know that ?

Are you sure !? 
During the initialization process of the Ledger Wallet, a passphrase is generated and given to you (a sequence of 24 random words).This passphrase allows you to retreive your bitcoins should your Ledger Wallet be stolen, lost, or damaged.

Thanks btchip and catsfive. It's (relatively) reassuring.

Hi Vlad !
I checked the website of Bithope. It is a nice idea but honestly, I don't know if I will succeed to raise the money I need for my project. The 14 campaigns raised on your website a total of 3.35btc and I need a minimum of 6.
It looks like I will not succeed to support the bitcoin with this video. I really want to finish this video, I will try to do it alone, like the first time and pay just the renderfarm.
Thanks for the help.

Hey Vlad,  thank you for your comment. 
I will work with 2 third parties :
- Nightshift,  (  a french animation studio.  They are very interested with this project and offer me to coproduce the video and pay only 2000€ on a total of 4000.  They have a very good experience in 360 vr (they postproduced the last 360 music video of Naive New beaters).
- Ranchcomputing.com : A french online renderfarm.  I need it to render the last part of the video (700 frames,  the resolution will be 4k and it need 7hours just for one frame on my computer.  I need a render farm because the rendering on my personnal computer should be something like 230 days... ). It should cost me 2000€, but I think I can negociate with them,  they already  helped me a lot on the first version.  I hope to pay just 700€.
So I think I could succeed the producing of this video for 6btc, maybe a little less if the singer can put some more money on it.
I wish I could prove that I will use this money only for the video,  but really don t know how to do that for the moment.  Feel free to give me some ideas.  Maybe something like a smart contract ? 
I already started some tests,  you can see a very low resolution at 5 frames per seconds here :

Thanks Doug,  thank you for the idea.  I didn't know watchmybit,  I like the concept but I see 3 problems :
- they don t have the technology for 360 virtual reality videos. 
- If I want to promote Bitcoins,  it is better if we do a lots of views. 
- I am not looking for the money after the production,  but to help the production.
