This is like what the 7th 30 to 40% correction we've had in 2017 and this one is at like 31%... Yawn... Nothing to see here... Move along... Ack the sky is falling... Sell sell sell... LOL Newbies are funny!!

Bcash is the new corporate coin... They tried to take over bitcoin with 2X and failed so now they are going after Bcash because it's centralized, easily changed, and easily controlled... And corporations love things they can control and that isn't Bitcoin!

I think he's out to lunch on this prediction...  If they wait for bitcoin to become so big it's unsettling national fiat currencies it will be way too big to ban...  Doing so at that late point would destroy the economy....  Heck it would be the economy!  JMHO

I think it should be dynamic and increase automatically when blocks get to say 80% full... Then simply increase it by a few more Mb...  And so on as needed...  Why can't that be done? 
That way if the traffic grows really fast it just bumps up as many times as necessary to compensate and you don't end up with much bigger blocks then necessary... 
That way it just grows organically as needed all ways staying ahead...

Well it can be a pain having all those wallets open on my computer but the reason I think it's better to keep them separate is because it's about decentralization and not keeping all your eggs in one basket... I suppose if it was powerful enough to keep different encryption for each type of coin as an option that would be enough security. Donno... Im on the fence with this... Maybe it would be a good thing if done right... Going to wait and see!

Doesn't mean the miners are making the same because of the difficulty increase and diminishing returns...  The price of bitcoin would have to be way higher to make the same as we were some time ago with the 25btc reward!

The only question is when will the next rally start? April? May? June? And perhaps how high will it go? I think we could see prices in the 3 to 5 thousand mark and when it corrects it will find a bottom around $1800 to $2000... Then slow and steady as she goes up up up...

It's been said "what you resist persists"  then the banks better get used to bitcoin cause it's going to be around and grow for years to come...  Nice try though...  Probably shook a few weak hands...  Temporarily...

That was a bubble that popped and it served a purpose...  It got a lot more attention onto bitcoin...  The market controls the price...  Plus save for one year bitcoin has been the best performing currency in the world!  And it will be again in 2016! 
And for the record...  Mt.  Gox didn't kill anything...  Bitcoin has been pronounced dead about 90 times already...  It will continue to March on laughing all the way at all the death rails...  
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:30:23
Here's a tip...  Don't buy or sell your coins based on the opinion of one person no matter who they are...  Especially someone who started working with the banks a while ago...  Their agenda is to try to kill bitcoin...  It won't work of coarse but they will try...  Guess they haven't rolled over yet and come to the conclusion that if you can't beat them join them?  Lol soon
Actually this move smacks of desperation on their part...  Lol

The current financial system...  A fiat system...  is a debt based slavery system! Every dollar carries debt with it... Bitcoin is sound money... No debt attached to any of it! There have been over 500 attempts at a fiat financial system in our history... They have all failed... They have all gone to zero... Just as our current system is about to do... In fact a fiat system has an average lifespan of about 27 years!

Yes it is volitile as all new currencies would be... But there hasn't been 1 instance where bitcoin was bought and held for 4 years or longer that was worth less than the purchase price! Not one! And when storing value people usually think long term... So it looks like a pretty good SOV to me...

What a stupid comment... "Whether Bitcoin is a store of value or not can be argued" Yeah by stupid people who don't understand what makes money sound!  It's "Deemed an SOV... I Deem you as dumb as shit!  Scaling problem?? It's called the Lightning network... Learn about it!!!  Alyse did an awesome job answering their questions and turning around their obvious attempts to make bitcoin look bad... In fact, her answers made them look to put it nicely... Very uninformed on the subject with a bias against it like they are being paid to paint it in a negative light. Luckily though bitcoin is so awesome itself that it doesn't work especially when someone can answer their loaded questions so well as to turn it around on them making bitcoin look all that much better!  These paid shills who are owned by the big banks are failing at controlling the narrative on bitcoin because bitcoin is just that good!  And they suck! lol

Where's the ASIC boost patch? Lol
@_date: 2016-02-15 17:10:20
I  have an idea about pruning that some people talk about in this thread...  Why not have two types of nodes?  One that stores say a year or two of the block chain information and a different one that stores the entire history...  That way everyone could run the main node and those with a lot of storage could run the others...  Then as an incentive there could be a fee for data lookups to pay those running the entire chain...  I'm no expert and I don't even know if this is possible but it sounds like it could work...

And if bitcoin reaches 1million per coin you will look back and say holy shit I paid 30 grand to watch a movie!  Lol

I've always thought that 95% is way too high... 75% is reasonable but 95% is damn near impossible to reach in bitcoin!

It's just my opinion...  Nobody has to agree with me but I'm sure many do...  Small blocks for now works for blockstream not the community...  I think the community doesn't want to see Bitcoin become a settlement layer for sidechains...

Still it would be nice to see at least 70% miner support by now.... Litecoin is over 80% not without their difficulties but they reached that number a heck of a lot faster than Btc... Let's hope a successful segwit implementation in Litecoin leads to a swift adoption here in Btc!  But it is still my belief that it will take a combined effort from  and

Come on baby! Let's see some sanity take over in the bitcoin mining camp! Everyone else is adoption it... Heck you guys unanimously came together to activate it on litecoin... Let's go...

Yeah they aren't saying it's Bitcoin... They are saying they want to interface with the blockchain technology but are they talking about public and open blockchains such as Bitcoin or their own Private and centrally controlled blockchain...

It's come out that the NYA was contingent on there being one chain after the fork... That is not a likelihood so that means the agreement is null and void and the parties are free to do as they wish... This issue is far too contentious to not create a split!

If bitcoin hits 1 million per coin in 10 years he was still right, he was only wrong in his timing!! Still, for his sake, I hope he's full-on correct!

The defining feature of fiat is that it can be inflated to zero while Bitcoin us a deflationary currency. I might add that the only thing to give any form of currency value is the people who agree on its value!

It is not and never has been a short-term investment!! If you are in for short-term gain and to "get rich quick" you will be rekd...  Just buy and hodl for the long term!! Idiots always highlight the drops from all-time highs but they fail to show that bitcoin even now is still UP over 100% from just 18 months ago!! Some call it a crash... Others call it a correction... I call it a sale!! Buy and hold!!

I wish updating nodes was made way easier than having to totally download a new version and starting over! 
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:30:02
But if you bought bitcoin on all those crash lows and sold on the highs you would do quite well...  So is say go ahead and buy bitcoin....  Just do it at the right times! 
It's a roller coaster ride...  One thing you can count on is after a down there will be another up...  Also notice that after each crash the price stabilized at a higher level than the previous crash...  And bitcoin is becoming more and more stable all the time!

Bitcoin is literally just scarce information that we keep track of... Information that anyone can control in small amounts with the keys or rights to move that information around a shared ledger!! The network and miners make sure all the ledgers agree so that no new information can be added! So 21 million "Coins" can be thought of as the entire information file!  What's so hard to understand about that?
@_date: 2019-05-19 07:01:47
According to the Bitcoin Rich list... Probably less than 100k would own more than 21 seeing as how 21 is currently worth about 168k... You can check out the bitcoin rich list here..

Users are going to activate segwit on Aug. 1st... That is going to happen! Question is does everyone want to risk a split based on getting half of what you want... We can live to  fight for bigger blocks another day... Problem is Jihan wants it all included in one agreement! One step at a time! 
Unless Miners beat us to the punch... I'm okay with that... Beat us... Give us segwit via MASF... I'd be okay with that but drag your feet past Aug. 1st... Nope that's the last straw!
