Thank you for saying this... I have been a long term investor in cryptocurrency due to the technology not because of quick gains. I hope this help diversify the true believers vs. the guys who are here for that $$$$ this will help stabilize the future of decentralization.

Is there any benefits of running this node?

Very smart, that’s what I shifted too as well. Let’s get that BTC dominance back to 45-50%

Well there's a few reasons why BTC is beneficial and not beneficial. Its your own money and the control of having what you own is what you own. Banks like to loan out money and loans money without even having the actual money in the bank, its even easier for them now since everything is electronic. So you'll see digital numbers in your account. I guess you can say its like BTC but once you own BTC its a public ledger where everyone can see if you actually own that asset. Its a unique aspect and necessary. Id say right now BTC needs quicker ways to make things universal, maybe a standard for BTC? Not sure yet but the fees make it attractive too, if I wanted to move money from US to Europe. BTC and fiat currently go hand in hand for these types of situations. Until we can find a set value for BTC? But then again maybe that's what makes it unique. To sum it all up if you use BTC it helps the general consensus and builds a strong reputation.

Yeah forsure I thought about that aspect as well. Of course there’s a set amount. And it’ll change value as more people use it and more people hold on to it. Depending on what you can purchase with it. I honestly think that BTC will be for bigger purchases that will eventually won’t fluctuate as much as it does today. Once everyone accepts BTC it could be equivalent to a 8000 sq ft home in NYC, who knows but eventually the volatility wont exist or increase bit by bit. Smaller purchases will be up in the air with other crypto. It’s hard to find exactly how BTC will fit in our society today. Will it replace fiat completely? Probably not? Will it be an escrow to purchase homes? Maybe? As of now until someone can figure out the core of it... Idk but we know it’s something big.

Standard as in 1 BTC = Value of something. 1 USD = 1 Arizona Green Tea. 1 USD = something you know is 1 USD. 1 BTC= $5,000 is not of value until we depart from fiat. But i'm not too sure of this maybe its the concept of being volatile connected with fiat, may be more attractive? Not sure.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:25:21
It's going to depend on how much reliability and resistant crypto is to the U.S. economy... If the stock market does crash will Bitcoin do what it is meant to do? That's the big question and only time will tell.

Your done man... It’s all over. Lol but in all seriousness they would only tax you on your profits because losses are deductible. I’m an accounting major going for the CPA even my professors don’t know exactly how they plan on taxing cryptocurrencies yet. Still an unknown area.

Go to litecoin mining forum and it is profitable if your Kwh cost is low.

It's funny cause Peter Theil one of the co-founders of PayPal believes in Bitcoin. You can tell who makes greater financial decisions/investments when you compare their net worth.  
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:36:35
I don't think most people want the financial system to fail, I think they want the change. Not only the change but you can economically see whats going on with inflation, and higher cost of living vs. minimum wage. The economy seems like its doing well, but in my opinion I believe that there is a lot of covering up with the recent stock market dip and tax benefits for company buy backs. Sooner or later the collapse will happen, history repeats itself. The only thing different this time is that we have cryptocurrencies and we're betting on the fact that the whole decentralization system will survive the crash. This is why Satoshi invented Bitcoin in the first place. Let's hope hes right :)
