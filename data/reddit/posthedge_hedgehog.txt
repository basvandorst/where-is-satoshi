Will it be 100% science based and realistic? ��

I think you're being too emotionally attached to this currency. Either something is a good or a bad investment. It can't be an "actually good investment ruined by market circumstances", which you seem to imply bitcoin is. Then it's just a bad investment.
Market capitalism.

Yeah, it's impossible to foresee how anything will develop economically in the future.
But still, at times of crises people tend to abandon unstable currencies and try for either gold, silver or other objects which will have a certain value in the future no matter what happens politically. Bitcoin is even more unstable than typical money, is dependent on a stable internet connection, and doesn't hold any physical value at all. It's also completely ethereal, which doesn't convene safety for the typical working Joe. If anything, I believe people would cash out and go for those traditional investments when the markets go south. There's too much speculation involved in BC for it to be a safe bet in uncertain times.

The US has the largest GDP of any country in the world. The military is a bonus on top of this. 
Unless the US breaks up and its economy goes down the toilet further than it's ever gone before, there'll be a big demand for USD.
@_date: 2018-08-28 14:21:17
Yeah, and no one is disputing that. 
It's simply that that alone won't kill the USD. It's more important that it's the official currency of the largest economy in the world.

"Totally saw it coming" as in that you had a gut feeling about it? Or what did you base your reasoning on?

1.69$ trillion is currently in circulation. 1% of that is 16,9$ billions. Divided by 1% of the world population (80,000,000), that gives us 211.25$. If instead divided by 1% of the US population (3,250,000) it's 5200$.
Congratulations, with that logic, you're part of the world 1% if you've got more than 211$, and you're part of the American 1% if you've got 5200$.
This is extremely bad maths that's being used, since it presumes all money to be divided equally and in a linear fashion.

Alright, I read your other reply, but I still have to say that the maths is kinda wonky. It doesn't take in consideration how it actually looks like with the BC distribution, so it's a purely theoretical value based on two variables (theoretical money supply, and population). The result is at best a curiosity, and at worst misleading, since some people will think that this theoretical mathperiment is applicable to real life.
What we need is the Gini coefficient, instead of assuming it to be a perfect equal 0.

If we're talking about before the 20th century, poor people worked at farms owned by not-so-poor people.

The people in charge of market economics really don't want this wave of anti-consumption to take hold. Our economies are designed for continual growth, or the overall balance will break. It makes me think of the Roman Empire, and how its economy couldn't maintain the constant acquisition of new arable land and slave labour.
We really need a new economic model to distribute resources without ruining the planet. International capitalism is too messy and inefficient. Just too bad that communism always fail. Just something which facilitates local production and self-sufficiency.

It's meant to make more people invest in anything except for just letting their money lie in a bank. Only people with large savings doing nothing would be majorly affected.

Hah, this is the most teenagey thing in the thread.
Most kids think they're great at being manipulative. Just remember that so did your parents when they were young, and they've been around to experience a lot more of it.
