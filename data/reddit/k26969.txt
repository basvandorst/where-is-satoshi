There are people who still cant get ETH mist wallet to sync, the entire billion dollar ETH market has been possible due to a huge amount of people with ETH on exchanges for very long periods of time.

Because he came out and said he did on slack lol

Thanks for the response, sounds like you guys are prepared.

If right now you experienced a hack and I lose the few BTC I have in coinbase would I as a retail guy be covered (I am not in the vault, but plan to move them this week) and what would the timeline be for recovery, etc?

There is not a bitcoin market without exchanges, your coins would be worth a fraction of what they are now if it wasn't for mt gox, and the many other avenues that have come and gone that allow people to trade. Not sure if you are into alts, but without exchanges (and people keeping coins on exchanges) there wouldn't be a billion dollar alt market either.

People like him and day traders are the entire reason your bit coins are worth more then $50, without exchanges (and day traders to buy) the miners don't have a viable way to fund their operations and the network gets drastically smaller.

Just hardfork lol

Couple of good margin trades and your back in business, did you trade up to that amount or did you have the coins from the early days?
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:29:41
Jesus, you would gamble that much on fucking ETC?

Thousands of people will never have to work again because of BTC, LTC and ETH. There are potentially going to be more, and its not crazy to try and get on the next train. Going all in is of course silly especially with BTC where it would take an insane capital injection to even double your investment if buying at current price.

The profit margins are tight and the large farms need to pay for next gen hardware deposits, employee fees, taxes and monthly energy bills. Sure some horde.

I would like an answer to this also, I use coinbase and a desktop wallet to diversify. Coinbase is also insured which in my mind is huge, but have not looked into the details.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:23:27
I use coinbase for this reason, I have never used the exhange though.

Agreed. Everyone thinks bad things cannot happen to them, until it does.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:44:01
FOMO is strong, I lost 10 grand in cryptsy and came right back to the game. Didn't lose anything on in this hack but had about 5 BTC on the exchange 2 months ago so could have happened. We like to convince ourselves bad things could never happen to us, until it does.

Money is just freedom points, the more you have the more freedom you can enjoy. I lost a lot in cryptsy and thought I was done, but made it all back and more already. There will be more opportunities, just make sure you are responsible with whatever capital you can raise.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:20:28
When and how bad?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:59:37
Exactly, just remember how pissed off you get next time when your phone or network gets laggy for a few seconds lol.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:09:20
Without traders buying the coins miners are dumping the price would be a fraction of what it is now.

Authoritarian collectivists are fucking scary people aren't they?

I never understand why people cannot wrap their heads around really simple concepts. You will ALWAYS get a better return on your investment when you do not route your capital through a non-prosecutable, un elected (most bureaucrats are not) middle man who adds zero value, and in fact siphons it away.. With technological advancements, and maybe even with the or a Blockchain to act as a central leger, people can for the first time fund their own community projects directly. This applies to everything you can buy, including roads.
ETA: As you can see in Detroit, evidently government does not provide water, private companies do, but most people paying attention already understand this.

First off, heard immunity relies on people being currently protected, what percent of adults in this country are up to date on their booster schedule? Vaccines do not last for more then 3-10 years in some cases. People think we have some magical herd immunity now, and anti vaxxers are trying to compramise that, when in reality we dont have herd immunity at all. 
 I have no problem with vaccines, but if my kid was born with some issue that meant they could not be vaccinated, I would never even fathom demanding the entire country vaccinate to keep him/her safe. I would take responsibility and homeschool, not be selfish and demand everyone in the country inoculate their children. Plan recreational activities that are not around others like hiking, camping. That burded is on me. Plus, alot of these vaccines are for non lethal ailments and have been shown in certain cases to hurt people, and I dont mean autism. If some huge virus hits the US with a 90% mortality rate and we have a vaccine, then I would understand alot of peoples arguments for forcing vaccines, I may not agree.
