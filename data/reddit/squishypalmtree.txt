Exactly. People on this sub think common people are smart enough and responsible enough to adopt crypto but until the usage of this currency gets any easier, most of the population is not ready to adopt. The majority of people in the US don't even have a savings account with more than $1000 and live paycheck to paycheck while having trouble doing anything computer related besides browsing facebook and opening Gmail - what makes everybody so sure these people can handle wallets and exchanges?

This. Capital One cards do not work, however. I called Capital One about why my card kept getting declined on Binance and they said "ohhh...this is crypto...we don't like crypto and don't let our customers buy this"

Well you assume I might know, but in reality I realize nobody will like a normal human being. This is why you buy all the way down in weekly increments

Why do you think it was manipulation?

lol nice. I will do the same one day and stand with you in defiance. I have a feeling it's because Capital One became a bank not too long ago..

Buy a paypal card with the gift card at a pharmacy or something and just upload the funds to paypal and transfer them. I believe they still sell paypal moneypacks?
