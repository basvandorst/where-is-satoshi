That's the irony here.  I sent $1 dollar and didn't have to put anything in the notes.  If I was actually buying bitcoin, they wouldn't have any way to know unless I told them.

People care, but they care more about themselves and how they look to others.  When you have big corporations like Google threatening you for putting the word bitcoin in a transaction memo, it creates a stigma around that word and people move more cautiously and often not at all.  So some people avoid it just because they know that people have a negative perception of it, whether that perception is right or wrong.  Most people just want to get along with everyone else.

I read the sections they cited and as best I can tell, I did not break any rules.  The sections they cited basically say that they can do whatever they want.

They are, which is why I wasn't surprised by Coinbase closing that persons account.  But in my case, I said bitcoin and I only sent $1.  Bitcoin is not illegal.

Did you read the email?  I made it super easy.  I did this in June 2014 right after I saw a submission claiming this would happen.

The sole function of Google Wallet is to send money, what are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-11-04 03:14:42
You would.

It's funny you mention that.  Someone around here put exactly that in a coinbase transaction note and Coinbase closed their account.

I confess, I sent my co-worker $1 and put the word bitcoin in the notes, lock me up!

Lets be honest, Bitcoin is a get rich scheme.  It is because it has made people rich and will continue to do so as long as it grows.  It's also everything else you described, but this is hard to grasp for many people because we've never seen anything like it before.  Usually the participants of a revolution have to pick up the pieces afterwards and create a new system in order to move forward, ours is a revolution and system all wrapped into one.

Serious?  Just for grins, short of giving you access to my gmail account, what sort of proof would satisfy you?

I'm positive that the word bitcoin was the reason my account was flagged for review, I tested it on my own based on second hand information and that information bared fruit.
  
Bitcoin offers tons of advantage for retailers as it eliminates fees.  You clearly don't understand what it costs to operate a small business.

Make sure you specify that it's pasteurized milk so they don't come down on you.

Satoshi could be a female or a group of females or...  I don't think you have thought this through enough.

It doesn't matter.  I put a note(memo) in my one dollar transaction and it contained the word bitcoin.  The word bitcoin was enough to flag it and warrant a Warning.  It wasn't anything that I did that was abnormal or outside of the offering, it was just the word bitcoin.

Here is the full text of that part that discusses virtual currencies basically everything else is a no no too:


Google advertises it as "Google Wallet makes it easy to pay - in stores, online **or to anyone in the US with a Gmail address**. It works with any debit or credit card, on every mobile carrier."
  
Again, I highlighted the part relevant for me *anyone in the US with a Gmail* for clarity.

If you read the full text it also says no cash transactions and a bunch of other things, I'm not so sure it's really living up to its advertising when looking at the whole offering and how it's presented.
  
Here is the full text of that part that discusses virtual currencies basically everything else is a no no too:  


Under certain conditions, some financial services would be permitted for the purposes of allowing a user to save a “show and scan” object to Google. Learn more about the policy exceptions.

I stated in my original submission that I did it as a test because someone was claiming that Google was flagging accounts that put the word bitcoin in the memo, so I wanted to see if it's true and it is true!
@_date: 2014-11-04 03:28:48
It's an insurmountable leap to go from $1 google user to google user with the word bitcoin in the memo to Gambling.  Unless Google is taking the stance that using bitcoin is gambling in which case I would draw their attention to where they get their money from.  Where is that inconceivable princess bride when I need it..

If you go to the Google Wallet Overview on their page it says:
  




  
I highlighted the part about or anyone in the US since that fits my use case.
