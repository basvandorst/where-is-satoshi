yeah, i hate such people too.
i experienced something similar while spending a few hours every day for the past year telling people on that their game is boring nerd shit and they should sell their boards because soon nobody will want to play that crap anymore and you wouldn't believe the hostility with which i was treated!

that is the biggest pile of bullshit i have ever skimmed.
not only do you wrongly assume that there is a market for child pornography (not the children themselves), you also wrongly assume that criminalizing drugs reduces the number of drug users.

there is no need to delete addresses that are blank.
addresses don't store balances.
there is just a list of unspent outputs. empty addresses do not take up any space at all, transaction histories do. i guess this is being worked on too.
if you are worried about diskspace but still want to run a full node you can just delete old blk000*.dat files. not everyone has to be a full archive node.

current block size is 1MB per block, one block is mined every 10 minutes and transactions have an average size that gives us a max limit of 7 tx/s.
to solve this temporarily we just have to increase block size again.

because scalability won't be an issue until bitcoin "has made it", by which point each of us will be rich enough to pay a group of professionals to solve it.
you just need to change one variable to get 70 instead of 7 tx/s which gives us more time.
I'm pretty sure it is already being worked on, just not with full priority.

imho the way to get politicians to keep their promises is basic democracy.
1. those who are too lazy to vote can delegate their vote to someone else
2. whenever a delegate votes in a way they don't like, they can veto the vote.
3. if that happens too often, they'll just delegate their vote elsewhere.
ofc you need a constitution to protect minorities so it doesn't end like in libya. other than that, let majority decide. not perfect, but it's harder to convince half a country to act against its interests than to convince a few hundred politicians.

bitcoin-qt is fine, but you should download the blockchain via torrent because the algorithm to download blocks is really shitty.
running it as a client node isn't bad for the bitcoin network but it would be better if you run a full node.
don't store large amounts of bitcoin on an insecure computer.

if you still have to ask that question you should really spend some time learning about bitcoin and probably not invest anything until you understand.

just because one way didn't work doesn't mean you have to pick the most moronic alternative available.

**stop downvoting this article**, this is fucking interesting!!!
some PBOC dude wrote on his blog about how shitty bitcoin is but said **nothing about a ban**. 
also he's going to be "told off" for it, if i understood it correctly.
is this actually good news?
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:23:42
yes but that's just one of the ways how they track you. there are others like your connection to their geoip database.
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:43:41
because 2/3 of the retards here still think china is *really* going to ban bitcoin and there is *nothing* that can be done to legally circumvent that "ban", so this joke is too soon to be funny.
@_date: 2014-04-01 10:13:26

you can't solve confirmation time (for blocks). but can you give me an example where confirmation time hurts you?

i guess they are private keys and you need to import them in any client that lets you import private keys. don't show them to anyone you don't trust.

i wouldn't be so sure about that. so far no country has **not** banned bitcoin as often as china did.
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:06:11


we don't have to. we don't need many miners to sustain the blockchain. more miners just make a 51% attack more difficult, but bitcoin has been the strongest computer network in the world for a long time already and it keeps growing.


every project has core devs. if you don't like that, create a group of core devs and fork the blockchain to create your own coin, not controlled by core devs. oh wait...
however, anyone can contribute code and ideas. you too.

yes stop using cloudflare, it's just a major theft/hack waiting to happen. they decode all SSL traffic that is going through them as part of their design.

7% sounds unrealistic. where do the savings come from?

so far there is nothing indicating electrum is not a good paper/brain wallet.

and also if the rumor is true, [why didn't that PBOC officual mention it when warning people about bitcoin?](
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:00:43
exactly this. we know china won't ban bitcoin, though they might apply rules similar to those they apply to other communities and exchanges will follow them and use workarounds like always.
all in all april 25 will be like any other doomsday before.

so did you clear your cookies, flash cookies, browser cache, reset your IP and block javascript before doing this or are you just another young teenager who doesn't know anything about the internet yet?
actually clearing regular cookies *might* be enough. did you at least do that?

when you buy a coffee the vendor doesn't have to wait for confirmations.
he instantly sees your transaction propagate through the network he won't have to wait for confirmations because a double spend is extremely unlikely to happen because honest miners don't accept double spend transactions and committing a crime for a coffee just isn't worth it.
7 seconds are quite long, i don't think anyone on earth has such a high ping :D

increasing the limit by factor 10 is no problem and will give devs time to improve it.
there's also no reason why the blockchain can't be split into blocks and stored in random parts on random nodes. not everyone needs a full history.
scalability won't be an issue until bitcoin has made it, and when bitcoin has made it I'll just donate a million or two to the task to fix scalability, so don't worry :)

right. right. moron.

what makes me think there is no such market?
where i live there was a big discussion about censoring the internet years ago and since then bloggers did some research about the sources of the figures the politicians were throwing around.
also there's [this study]( of the european financial coalition saying there is basically no market.
the reason for this is most likely that there are so few people willing to pay for such shit.
but with all the mentioning in the news and by assholes like you i wouldn't be surprised if that changes. like when television talks a lot about suicides or killing sprees more people copy the deeds...
