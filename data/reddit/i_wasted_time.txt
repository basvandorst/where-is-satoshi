A small town micro economy based on *any* currency is not a threat to amazon.  Their competetive advantage comes from big product range, low price, targeted product suggestions, so on.  None of that can be replicated with a one town micro economy.

Sorry for the thread necromancy, just stumbled on this while searching for something else.  I was a trader on localbitcoins too!  Pretty sure I've bought from you before, so thanks for your good service.  I got started on there because I love bitcoin and there were no cash traders in my area.  There still aren't... In the end I got tired of the craziness.  Like you said, it's a lot of checking emails, bank balances.  Having to race to the bank at inconvenient times.  
I agree with your conclusion.  The speculation gold rush is just a side effect of expansion.  But people have always loved the idea of easy money, so that's what stands out.  I've bought several things from overseas with Bitcoin and it was refreshingly simple and effective. I look forward to the day when bitcoin is as boring as the cash in your wallet.

Selling BTC for paypal is high risk for the seller, and has high fees.  Your guy may be willing to give you a better rate if you can pay him by cash deposit to his bank account.  That is usually the safest and fastest way on localbitcoins. 
Is there a reason you don't want to hold more BTC? If you hold, say, 0.5 BTC. Then you have plenty to spend when you want it, and you can top up via coinbase at your convenience.

I would (if I had the need for one).  There are some virtual assistants advertising on fiverr, which accepts bitcoin.  Not sure if they pay the workers in bitcoin though.

Wouldn't they save on credit card fees though? They have their own customer protection scheme, so the issue of no chargebacks probably wouldn't worry customers.

I wonder if it's all an elaborate plan, orchestrated by the real Satoshi, to remain hidden.  If he ever *does* get tracked down, it will be the  fifth time he's been 'found' and nobody will pay any attention to it.

I think it's a sign that Bitcoin is no longer 'play money'.  People used to donate because it was fun just to use it at all in the real world. But now it's becoming kind of normal and mainstream. 
Nobody donates fiat to charity because it's exciting to use, or because they are part of the 'fiat community'.  
It might be kind of sad to see the bitcoin community growing up, but at the end of the day, Bitcoin is money. People don't like giving away money.

Merchants defrauding customers.

answered you correctly.  But I get where you're coming from, since supposedly a major benefit of bitcoin is that it can't be controlled by governments.  
For China to ban it is, in a sense, a tacit admission of the real world functionality and usefulness of bitcoin.

Well if anyone wants to sell me ~~one bitcoin~~ one share in Bitcoin for $10 I will buy it.
