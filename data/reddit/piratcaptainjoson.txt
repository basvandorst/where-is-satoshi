Hope you can help me understand something:
If i run my own validating Node(No Mining) but does not use the Wallet of the Core client to store my Bitcoin(Or transact them through it) is it still helping the network to enforce thoses rules ?
EDIT:Spelling is hard, English is harder....

Trump Is not even invited to meet the Queen.

I dont think there Is an "alt.left"..... back to your question.... i Would call mySelf left/progressive AND i am a big Fan of Bitcoin. 
I am the  only one WHO controls my Money and i dont have to depend in The State or Banks or big companys is a realy interestig for me! A dezentralised and non hierachy Network where everybody can take part in and there Is no Single leader..... Sounds awesome!!!!! 
Big Problem ist most left Wing People dont know or understand the possibilities of Bitcoin and blockchain.... we need more education materials. 
And i dont think Energy Is a Problem..... there Is  more usage of power from Banks and the business Elite..... 
Sorry for my Bad english and Formation.... im in my mobile....

So you think everything in the Us Is Fine and there Is no Need for CommunitySuppport? Please take a Break from crypto and Talk to some People who work in these professions. 
There Is still a lot of repression and discrimination.
