So your confident there is a dollar backing each of your tethers?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:11:27
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:15:23
I’m afraid to ask...
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:26:31
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:00:20
Funny money ends badly.  Every time.  When Tether is exposed for what it is, all exchanges that use it will collapse.  It will be MtGox all over again, only much worse.
I got reddit rekt for suggesting a few days ago when I said that the Bitconnect collapse could lead to Tether being outed.  That still might happen, although the MSM appears to have totally ignored the BCC story.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:34:17
No it hasn’t popped yet.  If/When Bitfinex collapses, that will be the popping sound.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:57:48
That way you know which bank is involved...
Except you don’t.

Bitconnect tokens were bought and paid for with roughly $4 Billion worth of Bitcoin.  Bitconnect tokens are now worthless.  Bitconnect ‘refunded’ worthless Bitconnect tokens.  Bitconnect still has $4 Billion in Bitcoin.
Let me know where I lost you.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:33:01
Maybe they can trade them for BCCs.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:22:34
We do not say it’s name in Post body text.  Mod bots are out n about.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:50:25
No BCash.  Ruh roh Roger.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:28:24
Correct.  I believe the BCC story is going to snowball.  Big time.  
It will  cause many to rethink their positions, especially when backdropped against a 25% loss from today.
If the Tether Operation is what I think it is, then those exchanges won’t be able to support a wave of withdrawals.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:19:05
What happens if people on the Tether exchanges start moving toward the exits in any significant number?  
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:18:57
‘Preciate it.  Might wanna have that looked at btw.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:57:33
The platform is Bitconnect. Mods on this board flag any mention of it in Post text. In this case, the story is material to the price of bitcoin so it’s posted here.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:43:02
MtGox lost $450 million worth of Bitcoin.  BCC will end up stealing somewhere north of $4 Billion worth of Bitcoin.  That is roughly 10x no?
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:59:15
Tether is imploding.  It’s not FUD, it’s the inevitable outcome of funny money.  It will bring all of crypto with it.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:47:29
Very steady as indicated by their recent audit...oh wait...
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:16:36
You can’t print 100 Million tethers per day forever.  Sooner or later those exchanges are going to collapse.  Bitcoin is heading back under 1,000. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:23:28
Go ahead and ignore the fraud happening all around you (not just BCC). I’m sure you’ll be fine.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:21:24
Also, your numbers are backward.  Mt Gox had $450 million worth of BTC stolen.  At its peak, BCC was a $4.1 Billion Ponzi Scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:47:53
Do they make a t-shirt that reads:  “Stick an ice pick in my ear until I give up my private keys”?
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:31:23
Oh I see.  I thought you referring to Long Island Blockchain or something.
If you think a $4 billion Crypto Ponzi Scheme that targeted minorities isn’t going to make headlines and spill over into your house, then I can’t help you.  
If I’m wrong, then I liquidated my positions yesterday for nothing and I’ll congratulate you on your good fortune.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:39:02
I concede you’re way ahead of me in experience.  And congrats on your returns.
I always research the bear case on my own positions, which lead me to BCC.  I estimate they stole $4 Billion.  That’s among the top 10 Ponzi schemes of all time right there.  All this new money (like me) in Bitcoin is going to see that story and run.  What happens when these exchanges, run by arrogant a-holes, can’t pay the withdrawals?
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:19:32
And 10 minutes before the dead cat $1,000 bounce in the price of Bitcoin just a few hours ago, another $100 million worth of Tether was minted out of thin air.
Don’t talk to me about what’s real.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:48:44
Maths are hard.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:17:54

@_date: 2018-01-17 20:04:42

@_date: 2018-01-08 20:22:47
...what I’m talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:01:15
So then you are confident that somehow they have taken in an additional $300 million in the last 3 days to back up the 300 million new Tethers that have been printed in that time?
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:22:14
I don’t like you because you’re sticking up for crooks who target poor people.  
^ My deal.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:46:26
Congrats on your returns.  I was late to the game and had to settle for a measly 5% avg return when I closed my position in BTC, LTC, and ETH over the weekend.  I’d be looking at serious losses had I not.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:05:57
In that case, I have some Petros I want to sell you.

Head to your nearest monopoly board game.  Open box.  Remove $1 Monopoly note.  Congratulations, you are holding 1 USDT.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:43:03
This appears to be basically a data entry error from the price calculations on a website causing market over reaction.  I bought a small amount of BTC and ETH on this dip.  
Note:  13% price swing now qualifies as dip.  Ain’t that some $hit.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:19:35
Hard, not impossible.  In 2015 hackers stole an estimate $billion from accounts in Russian banks by making ATMs spuriously spit out cash and having mules standing by to pick it up.

Futures aren’t live yet.  They wouldn’t dump before initiating their short position.  This is retail investors dumping anticipating a crash.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:11:25

Then here’s a few more for you:  how many credit cards have been stolen?  Debit cards skimmed?  Fake lines of credit taken out using hacked personal info? Cash stolen from underneath mattresses?
This entire argument is bs since anything can and will be stolen.  When utilized correctly, Bitcoin is by far the safest means of wealth storage and transport available today.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:13:57
I realize this sounds paranoid, but this sort of thing is done with individual stocks all the time, and is not a terribly expensive maneuver.

I don’t know the specifics.  But with Bitfinex’s questionable liquidity and Coinbase’s routine server issues, I suspect it wouldn’t take much to get that snowball rolling.

If Bitcoin were indeed a currency, then its unbridled deflationary nature would cause economic paralysis and eventually collapse.  Who would ever spend a currency that doubles in value every other month?  Nothing would ever move.
If BTC wants to evolve into the perfect safe haven for your wealth where elitist crooks can’t touch it, then we ought not fight it.

While I’m no expert, I see a lot of people worrying about Bitfinex and Tether being a scam, which if true and went belly up,  would erode public confidence in crypto big time.  Ensuing selloff could feasibly crash other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:58:35
Depends on the debt.  Student loans or car loans are cheap money and those won’t bleed you dry.   But If you’re carrying credit card debt with 20%+ interest then you shouldn’t be investing.  Payoff the expensive debt before you do anything.

It has occurred to me that the run up this week was institutions accumulating enough coin to engineer a sell off to profit from their short position when futures open.  
Following that sell off, they could scoop up enough discounted coin to effectively control the price for the foreseeable future thus eliminating the biggest threat to their control of global finance.

Think of Bitcoin in terms of real estate in the 1800s, not currency in today’s terms.   There is only so much to go around and more and more people are showing up daily trying to get in on it.  What’s happening now is a land grab in the Wild West.  Retail investors are your settlers risking their asses and institutional investors are your tycoon types.  Many a little guy will get burned trying to grab their slice.  At the same time, unspeakable fortunes will be made, most likely by the big players, but some of the little guys will rise with it.  But understand you’re on your own and among wolves.  If you don’t have the stomach for that, stay east.
