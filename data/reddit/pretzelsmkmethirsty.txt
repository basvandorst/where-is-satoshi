So the end goal is to pay your power company for the privilege of allowing random internet companies to nickel and dime you to death? Why does the consumer have to pay for everything on the internet all of a sudden?

Let me get this straight, you want regulations but only if they're voluntary? You do know what will happen right? People will flock to the unregulated exchanges because they'll have smaller spreads and fees, along with more lax oversight of your funds. Voluntary regulations won't solve a thing in this kind of market.
Also how is requiring a business license violence? Not even SJW's can stretch the definition of a word like that.

It's true, I've been sitting under my bridge pouting all month. I don't even care about the people passing over it anymore. 
Thanks Satoshi. Ya jerk.
@_date: 2015-01-17 21:46:04
Because that's worked so well in the past, right? Or did everyone with MtGox or the dozens of other bitcoin exchanges/services that went down/got hacked/ran away with your money simply choose wrong?
Regulations are largely useless when they're not mandatory and highly centralized. You can't half ass things like this, either go all the way or don't do anything at all.
@_date: 2015-01-17 17:44:04
By your logic a speeding or parking ticket is violence, a fine for not complying with workplace safety regulations is violence, hell even getting arrested for selling crack on the street corner is violence. You're twisting the definition of violence to mean 'any action that has a negative outcome for someone', and then you go and start making shit up like initiatory violence.
I don't even care about your thoughts on regulations anymore, this whole violence thing is just hilarious.
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:31:52
I see so many parallels it's ridiculous. I'm really curious to see how regulations will be handled in the future, it can't stay Wild West forever.

Did you not see the part where it said former CEO? It's a private investor doing his private investor thing, nothing to do with Citigroup in any way.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:49:42
So then how is fraud violence? Theft isn't inherently violent either. Also are you actually saying that people should be given free reign to do whatever the hell they felt like as long as they don't physically hurt other people?
Hold up, better question, how is enforcing regulations violence? It's not like auditors go up to corporate HQ and threaten to beat up the CEO unless they comply.


Bolded is the important bit. A cop's use of physical force isn't to cause harm, it's to arrest someone. 
So that's 3 definitions of violence between 3 posts, you don't even limit yourself to 1 definition per post. Get your shit together.

Speaking of Arduino clones, I have a Leonardo clone that's barely a few months old and the usb port is already very flakey and the soldering on everything is pretty terrible. The build quality difference is actually pretty huge.

A [dead cat bounce.](

Those things are such a hilarious waste of money, I can't believe people still buy them. All it does is make the ECU think you're pressing the gas pedal more than you actually are. So say you press it 50%, it'll translate that to 70%, that's it. $300 to save yourself from moving your foot an extra centimetre further.

You're trying to say rent costs perfectly mirror inflation in both direction and magnitude. I'm saying that's hilariously wrong is all.
Seriously, look up how CPI is calculated, hell if you want you can calculate it yourself your own basket of goods. This is first semester intro to economics-level stuff, it's not exactly complicated.
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:57:45
But not the kind of bounce you want to see unless you're shorting. I like your optimism though.

If they allowed people to file bankruptcy and default on student loans everybody would do that because recent graduates don't have a whole lot of assets and their whole life ahead of them to turn their credit rating around. Then nobody would be able to get student loans unless they pay a stupid high interest rate because of the ridiculous default risk. Student loans are a completely different creature than any other loans; low  interest, no collateral, and a high face value. Because of that you have to treat them very differently.
It's a simple concept and blows my mind that some people don't understand it. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 11:43:44
Jesus Christ are you really that simple-minded you think that rent costs will always follow inflation 100% exactly? There are so many factors that go into housing costs it'll make your head spin, everything from local to international. Dunning Kruger in full effect here, next time read up on something before spouting off.
@_date: 2015-07-28 22:21:25
The fact that you use the phrase banking cartels un-sarcastically tells me all I need to know about your mindset. If you don't want student load restrictions you're welcome to find an alternative, I'm sure creditors will be lining up in droves to give unsecured $100k loans to 18 year olds interest-free for the first 4-6 years. The fact is students would never be able to get anywhere near the amount they would from student loans through any other means, and there's many damn good reasons for that.

It doesn't reduce the lag one bit though, that's all done inside the ECU. Throttle lag is when there's a delay between pressing the gas and the motor revving, pressing it slightly harder isn't going to get rid of that. It'll make the motor rev faster, yes, but that's not throttle lag.
Anything short of an ECU reflash is just a shitty bandaid.

Ever heard of diversification? You know, the concept of not putting all your eggs in one basket just in case something like this happens? If you can't afford to diversify just invest in an ETF and you don't ever have to worry about the price of a single stock going down.
This is the kind of education you'll never get from Satoshi's toppest minds so relish in it's beautiful simplicity, or just brush me off as yet another troll working hard at gently massaging the sacks of Goldman execs, whatever works for you.

Jesus Christ that's so relevant it hurts. I wonder if the guy even realizes what he's doing and the beautiful irony of it all.

Show me where it says they link a specific phone to a specific purchase. Because all I see is a camera to track how many people walk in/out and how long a certain phone stays in a certain area through bluetooth, not wifi. You're 0 for 4 on your claims and your own article disproved you, good job, did you even read it?

You do realize that downvoting on a user's pages does absolutely nothing right? You've accomplished nothing while looking like a total tosser, but I'm sure you're used to that by now.
@_date: 2015-02-13 03:23:20
And how do you propose they connect your phone's MAC address with your cash or even credit card purchase? And please explain, if this were even possible, how this would 'increase profits from a business perspective'. Hint, tracking purchase history actually does help the business, but how does it help?
