Thank you that makes sense yeah I’m trying to figure this all out from every angle  . Just playing around, I put $1000 on bitcoin on Coinbase and it’s up to 92 + bucks just playing around man thank you for your information  I am neither a math major or a crypto guy. But it’s better than let thousand dollars just sitting savings earning nada.

OK I guess I assumed that one of the categories states up 30% in the last 24 hours for the day I was thinking that was an average that you would add a total due? I don’t know

They didn’t have %’s in the 70’s.  Geez everybody knows that.  Shiiit
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:42:17
Yes it was a typo, OK that’s my point why isn’t it reflecting 30% on my thousand dollars on Coinbase wallet?

Yes I understand the amount of bitcoin purchase will not change only the value of that small amount of bitcoin changes just like paper dollar bill kind of. I basically purchased what I was ended up with was US dollar amount $933 on Coinbase that’s what was in my wallet. 2 mins ago it was 1028. I am not a serious crypto guy like I’ve been reading on all these forms I’m just trying to see what works    Again I don’t Have all the lingo down I am just playing around here Don’t mean to offend anybody by not having the proper terms sorry

Yes I understand that my .09398012 Shares of one bitcoin, will not change. The value of that changes. But for discussion sake,If that much was worth $1000 yesterday, and say bitcoin went up 7% since that was bought yesterday wouldn’t the wallet show the dollar amount of $1070
