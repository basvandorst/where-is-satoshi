TFW one fear provoking post on Reddit from some random account is enough to substantially drive the prices down.

Where can you buy groceries with bitcoin though?
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:41:45
Yeah, I hear the theory, but for some reason I cannot seem to find any of that happening in practice. So, maybe the theory flawed.
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:01:52
So, can you give any specific examples how it is already possible to use it for non-luxury stuff, e.g. cheap food?
@_date: 2018-05-29 12:54:38
These points make sense, and further show how bitcoin just doesn't seem like something for the poor in the near future.
@_date: 2018-05-29 19:00:38
My original point is that it doesn't look like there are going to be any sellers of essentials accepting bitcoin in said home country.
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:39:27
I keep seeing people talking about lambos, vanity buys, candy etc. Nothing about budget groceries.
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:29:59
So would you say that at this moment Bitcoin is of use just for upper class people who can afford luxurious purchases?
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:15:53
But are there any practical ways(not theoretical, something that is possible already) for them to use bitcoin that wouldn't cause loss?
@_date: 2018-05-26 11:15:03
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:34:16
Something definitely seems to be preventing it from happening, I haven't seen one such place yet.
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:11:16
I'm talking more of actual spending. I kinda doubt that poor people are the kind of people who can afford to save up much.
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:51:42
So, there are actually ways for the lower class who can't afford luxury to use it?

If normal currency is so bad, why do you buy bitcoin with it, instead of buying it with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-13 06:55:16
Ask Dread Pirate Rodgers.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:11:43
So, it's not stable?
@_date: 2018-11-15 11:05:36
Measuring BTC against USD yields more useful information than measuring BTC against BTC.

sounds like @_date: 2018-04-25 13:32:29
Is there any place where we can see all these expected pull backs?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:25:58
I imagine it would if they invested in BTC becoming more accepted as general purpose currency more instead.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:33:42
I don't care about lambo. When can I finally buy rice and buckwheat with it?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:29:10
More like anyone who thought anything that's not based on verified evidence is delusional.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:27:57
Is the increase a net increase or increase relative to the droped price though?
