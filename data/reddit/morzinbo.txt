Maybe it's that your comment is just generally ignorant? Is there a source for your comment? How does one qualify what matters to the rest of the planet? Is this not a global economy that we're working with? How does the population of one nation translate into how laws are perceived globally?
To make matters worse, Sweden, who's banking laws have been of such major impact to world economics, has, as of 2012, 96% less people than the USA. In fact, that is currently 0.13% of the world's population.
Even worse than that, The Vatican, housing the Pope of the Catholic Church as well as the center of Catholicism (estimated to have 1.21 billion followers), has a population of 798! This is only 0.0000114% of the world's population!

That anonymity thing is a really odd thing. I'm fairly certain that if you are trying to use bitcoin for illicit purchases, wouldn't you...
* Use multiple wallets
* Run your Bitcoin through a mixer into multiple wallets with varying amounts
* Not use the same wallets over and over
Or is this not a very anonymous way to use bitcoin?

You're arguing with a buttcoin shill. There's no need to bother.
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:01:42
nobody cares, man. you're speaking to an entire group of people that don't give a damn about what you have to say.
@_date: 2015-03-28 06:48:06
you're arguing with a buttcoin shill, you know.
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:40:12
and it's gone.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:57:02
shillin' like a villain.
please tell me that they pay you, at least.
Edit: to the people downvoting me, this is a very new account that has repeatedly stated its disdain for bitcoin, so if you still think it's not a shill account, downvote away.

if convenience was king linux wouldn't have survived to this day.
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:31:27
That's actually a pretty sweet way to introduce people to bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:50:49
It's interesting how much everyone here stresses the weakness of long term storage of bitcoin online, yet that's kind of exactly what happened here.
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:30:27
Wow, butthurtcoin is out in full swing today!

I've seen a lot of people defend their turf on Wikipedia, so I don't know hoe effective that'll be. 
@_date: 2015-03-29 17:53:48
Relax, buttcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:52:46

@_date: 2015-03-08 16:29:05
Sorry, I won't believe you until the obligatory passive aggressive edit. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 10:26:33
Yeah, but you can do that with cash, too.
@_date: 2015-02-10 06:06:18
wikipedia isn't crowd-sourced. wikipedia is run by the power users who will edit pages to fit their agendas.
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:27:58
OMG if wikipedia is any indication this means that NOBODY is going to buy this product now!!!
..or at least, that's what the buttcoiners would have you believe.
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:26:33
TIL wanting to make it easier to donate makes me a demanding whiny bitch. Go back to buttcoin, shill.
@_date: 2015-03-25 07:25:22
this guy is a buttcoin shill, so it's probably best not to bother replying.
@_date: 2015-03-08 16:23:52
Yeah, I'm wondering the same thing. Wasn't there also a card they were offering?

It is more accurate to say "a creator of Terraria" than "the creator of Terraria"

In Chrome, you right click the page, choose "Save as...", save whatever file name you want, ensuring you picked "Webpage, Complete" as the Save type, and choose your USB drive as the save location.
