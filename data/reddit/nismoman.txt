Buy a ledger if your portfolio exceeds $10,000 or so down the line. (Which can happen faster than you think depending on how u invest your crypto)

Very sorry for your losses regarding your cats. I have pet dogs, and would be devastated if I lost them.
Sorry for your other losses as well. It must have been very tough.

Because mineable coins have a limitted supply, and your computer is doing work to get some of that pile.

I hodl most, i study trading and have been experimenting with a small % of my portfolio. So far successful with most of my calls. I only go for really obvious moves.
@_date: 2018-08-18 05:04:20
Diversify your strategy. Put most in savings or other safe avenues like 401k or apps like acorns. 
Basic knowledge of economics will help especially in terms of learning how supply and demand affects price but in regards to trading; look up the wall street cheat sheet (which explains the psychology of market cycles)  and also how to use different indexes (available on various exchanges and trading tools).
Personally, an over-extension on Bollinger bands or bearish tweezers for crypto usually means sharp short term drops (because pumpers or short term excitement). These are the things i meant by obvious calls. But if it’s only an experiment with a small % of your portfolio, then you can’t be burned too hard. Invest an amount that matters (so you will learn since it will be an amount that matters to you) but also an amount you can afford to lose (so that emotions won’t make you lose money).
Most people lose money because the way the markets move always makes your emotions try to get you to make the wrong move. This is why the patient win. In other words, your highest chance of success is just to hodl or sell at targets.
So save and hodl most of your disposable income, and play with a small amount (to learn).

Bitcoin core is what bitcoin cash people like to call bitcoin because their aim is to overthrow bitcoin because bitcoin cash has a larger blocksize. I think the whole argument is missing the point a bit.
But people get triggered because the whole notion of calling bitcoin: bitcoin core is a threat imposed by the bcashers.
In my opinion, this is just the latest fud, and it too shall pass.

If you want an easy app, I guess you are stuck using coinbase. However, the switch to gemini was worth it for me. No app though. You pay the premium for the app. And also the shitty service.
@_date: 2018-05-04 01:07:55
Make an account on binance.com (make sure to go to the real site, plenty of fake sites out there to try and steal coins.). Transfer your funds to binance and buy the other 100s of coins you can buy with your bitcoin. Make sure to research whatever you buy before you buy it.
@_date: 2018-05-28 06:55:47
Buy low sell high. So you’re doing something right.
@_date: 2018-05-04 04:27:25
You can store them on Binance. Binance will make a separate wallet for each coin for you and its relatively simple to manage. But if its a lot of money you may want to consider a hardware wallet. Your account on binance should be 2 factor authenticated and you should back the 2 factor authentication up by printing out the secret codes. For more details regarding this stuff you can refer to youtube. There is a slight risk when storing coins on exchanges because there is a risk to get then hacked and stolen by hackers. But binance is known to be one of the safer exchanges. So it should be relatively safe.... however, if you don’t 2 factor authenticate your account, a virus on your own computer can make your account susceptible to hackers.

There are many reports of lost funds from people that attempted to withdrawal from coinbase with support completely ignoring them for months.

Mr. Market is a little crazy. Sometimes he's way overly optimistic, and sometime he is way overly pessimistic. I gauge the price based on which way this irrationality is going. Since people seem overly pessimistic at the moment; I think that it is a good time to start buying in as it drops.
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:40:30
Exactly. Just because you have a dollar bill in your wallet that someone used to snort lines of coke does not mean you are guilty of a crime or become tainted.
Yes your cash in your wallet probably has been used to do things you would wish you had not known at some point.

Try Gemini. Pro tip: avoid coinbase like the plague
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:21:13
Because high fees, they freeze your accounts for stupid reasons, *maybe* steel your money, their support is non-existent. I'm surprised they are still in business. Yes, people have reported large amounts of lost funds; and coinbase just gives the finger.
I have first hand experience. I froze a USD transfer to my USD wallet through my bank (because you cannot undo USD transactions on coinbase) i meant to take it from a different account. They froze my account for this, I tried contacting support but its been months since a real person got back to me. When a real person did reply back, they didn't understand my problem (probably because they don't understand english); and then a real person has not spoken to me until I complained on reddit but by that point I took my business somewhere else.
If I let the ACH transaction go through, I would have had a $7,000 overdraft on my checking account that I cannot undo for weeks. By freezing the transaction, coinbase did not lose any money because I did not buy any currency with it. So you would think they would unfreeze my account as no harm was done.
Coinbase, you lost me; and a ton of other people on here. We will not forgive your bullshit.

Trust no one. But i wouldn’t worry about the dark net thing so much unless you are doing things illegal with bitcoin yourself. If anything use localbitcoins.com for person to person transactions from a well reviewed seller.
The primary use of bitcoin in the early 2010 era was mostly for illicit purposes so you would imagine a lot of bitcoins are “tainted” that are in circulation right now anyways.
Do not buy from the redditor.

That's the million dollar question. Invest a little bit at a time during dips. It just dipped, so that ship sailed, but yes it may drop down to 3000 or so.. Or go up to 7000 then down to 4500.. Or back down to 2000... Who knows.

@_date: 2018-02-14 05:09:13
I'm not really a fan of diversifying myself, when it comes to crypto. Because only a hand full of tokens will be successful in the long run IMO. But that's just me. To each their own.

Hello, accountant here: if you sell your btc yes, you have to pay capital gains tax on it. Your gain is your current value (when sell) - cost basis (when buy). Whatever your service was worth in USD or what you normally charge i think can be your cost basis. Or whatever your bitcoin was worth in usd when you received it should also be okay. A best estimate may also work. However, i would claim the gain on your personal return rather than your business return because there is risk claiming it on your business return without a proper license.
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:12:21
Btw accountant here, your tax man will not be much help in regards to crypto. There are those rare tax people out there that do know about crypto, but the price will likely be too high for you to afford. I’m not sure what to do myself than use cointracker and give my best estimate and see what happens.
But yes, you should be able to claim it as a loss and see what happens.
