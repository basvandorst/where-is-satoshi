True. but also they don't make a lot of money, you could expect the same from many working class people who are awful with money. I guess what I am saying is it's not a one stop solution, you still need to put in some work. 
But I'm glad yours is looking healthy.

haha good catch! I guess I didn't have time to make one properly :P

But for real, being right wouldn't be the worst anti April fools joke ever ( right behind the rick and morty episode drop last year, obviously)

got a bunch of family who have 401ks they have about 100-150k waiting for them. TBH that seems like shit, obviously it's better than nothing but id rather not work my whole life to then worry about living on 100k for however long I have left (obv 401ks are different, if yours is fatter, grats.)
Gota do what works for you I guess. I don't want to retire at 60, 40 would be preferable.

Naw. 99% sure it was simply “that’s what she said” and he said nothing else. Iirc there was some issue getting him for the last episode, he had almost no lines and that one was one of the only spoken by him.

I love old fucks chiming in on new tech. If you don't understand something, sit down with your piles of fucking money and get someone to bring you up to speed, that or get the fuck out of everyones way.
So sick of decrepit people rotting away and bringing their vision of how the world used to be with them and imparting it on us all.

rofl @ the Nier banner. Also that wouldn't be a bad name for a CC. 
Nice work!

“That’s what she said” was a very fitting final line for him to end the show on.

What I love most about that video is his follow apology video addressing the flip out is from the same angel, same room, same clothes. 
It appears that he's throwing a tantrum and then almost imminently calming down and saying sorry. He seems very reactive and unstable.

I 100% agree with both of these comments.
it's a weird issue, and if anyone says different their wrong.

weird, maybe its how long you have been sub'd to r/bitcoin

Show her the chart, explain you want to buy a small amount, diversify. Explain to her how much 1,000 Dollars in BTC today will be worth at all of the above benchmarks and even at 50% of the above bench marks. 
It's worth tossing some money in, you don't need to go balls to the wall to invest smartly. Just put a little away, if it blows up, you will have made some money still.

aww, now it's sad.

same, on the website myself.

Valve accepting BTC on Steam for games is a good sign. fees are high I hear, but a step in the right direction for sure.

less big plot twist, he is talking about sucking himself off, and he would love it if you watched. Dude is a pretty big into weird sex shit, iirc, prob win / win for him.

Do you know the date they started? I noticed it's been there for a bit too but I don't know how long.

Another noob here. So I have my coins in a personal wallet. Nothing more needs to be done for this fork stuff? Just wait and see sort of deal?

This. Just because you are smart with money doesn't make you worth listening to. 
Too many money people are also insane sociopaths, this dickbag among them. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:26:32
What blows my mind is, they (billionaires) can still be buttfucking wealthy and be altruistic, like you can be rich and help people, you don't need to ALSO be fucking evil.
