The aim of the game is to "eat" other larger fish, causing them to lose half of their "weight", and giving you most of the half lost. The likelihood of eating the other fish depends on how much larger it is than you.
In order to play, you first select a fish which a small percentage of your winnings will go to (select "Minecraft Server" :p)
Next, bookmark the page when prompted, as this will be the only way you can "logon" to the game.
Then you must add funds to your fish (weight). You can add any amount of funds, however your fish will not appear unless it has a minimum of 0.1btc, so you will want to start off puting at least .1btc into it.
Now you can start playing! To play, just click on a fish that is bigger than yours, your fish will swim to it and try to eat it. Either you, or the opposing fish will halve in size, and the other fish will gain that weight, giving a small amount to the originally selected "sponsor" fish, and a even smaller amount to the webhost. Of course, due to the game working as a kind of PvP game, you can win/lose btc at any time, even when you are offline, so if you wish to withdraw funds from your fish, press the button in the lower-right (make sure your fish has at least 0.1btc left in it, or it will become invisible).
Hopefully this helps :)
