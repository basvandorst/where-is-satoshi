You're fighting a losing battle here.
All of the Reddit climate change deniers will not interact in good faith. They will instead demand you jump through their hoops, and never concede a point.

At any given moment you are feeling a particular emotion for a particular reason.
The trick is to be self aware enough first to know what you are feeling, then to know why you are feeling that. Next level is understanding what other people are feeling, and then making good judgement about why they are feeling that way.
It takes practice and inner peace, both of those feed into each other.
For instance I felt upset by this post. Why? Because I feel guilt over losing our house and getting fucked over in divorce negotiations. Knowing that I am upset lets me examine those feelings of guilt to help deal with them.
Once you know what and why you are feeling, you can begin to modify your behaviour and reaction to things. Knowing that stories about financial failure or regret will upset me, lets me accept that feeling and not let it rule me.
It's kind of like a game to remain in a zen state of calm and quiet happiness.
Hope that helps you!

Visitor from r/all here.
When people are buying bitcoins, whose are they buying? I thought that Bitcoin had a finite supply?  Are most bitcoins being hoarded right now? What does HODL mean?
Thanks, sorry for the dumb questions.

Random from here
Do you have git commits or just pasted copies of certain versions?  (Asking because commits may have comments referencing task tickets or whatever)
Hope you guys get this fixed going forward.  Could this be the work of one bad actor or would it require the whole dev team?

Not sure if you're being aggressive or not, but I'll explain what I meant by the previous one-liner.
I very much agree that this seems to be malicious in nature, in that it was previously configurable but now hard coded.
I was wondering whether there was any documented decision making process behind the change, hence my question about commits.  Since there isn't, we can only really assume the worst because all we have is the evidence so far.
My "not much information" statement was more referring to how we can't say much except "this thing exists, it looks bad so we have to assume it's bad".
For something as important as money or ledger entry verification, you want to trust the tools you are using as much as possible.  Bitmain should publish their source, their build parameters and build tools such that 3rd parties can verify that the given source turns into the given firmware.
At least, that's my opinion.
Disclosure:  I think I mined like a fraction of a percent of a block once a few years ago.  I doubt I have more than a cent in bitcoin.  I probably have a dollar in Dogecoin, because it was funny.  I've been a redditor for about 6 years, but I recycle accounts often because I have a stupid habit of over sharing.

heh, sorry for jumping to that conclusion, thanks for clearing it up, Internet Pal :)

Ah, so not much information to go on.  Bummer.
