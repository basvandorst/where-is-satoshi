Every metaphor falls short in some way, that's why it's a metaphor. A simplified version of reality. I mean, if you want to be pedantic, sure a real-life bubble is gone when it pops, so the metaphor of an economic bubble falls short. But I don't think that this can be called 'actively confusing instead of enlightening'. In the same way, people do not get confused by 'broken hearts', 'cold feet', or 'stock market collapse', even though broken hearts are not literally broken, someone with cold feet can actually be warm, and the stock market collapsing does not literally mean buildings falling down on Wall Street.
It would be ridiculous to say that Bitcoin is not a bubble because of the fact that it might recover after collapse. I think the metaphor of a bubble growing, meaning something growing until it's unsustainable, after which it will collapse is quite adequate for what might be happening with the Bitcoin.
I mean, come on, if you look up bubble in the dictionary, it quite literally means : "a state of booming economic activity (as in a stock market) that often ends in a sudden collapse." Nothing about regrowing. I honestly think responding to people saying 'Bitcoin is a bubble' with ['Well actually...']( like you just did, you are being pedantic, and redefining well used meanings for words, just so it suits what you want it to.
Disclaimer: I'm not saying anything about Bitcoin being a bubble or not. I don't know, and to be honest, no-one can really know. I just think it's ridiculous to argue about the definition of such a widely used word. It's like arguing that the planet Mars isn't real because he's actually a Roman God and you don't believe in God.

Can you tell me how you generated the private key from the passphrase? Because there are a lot of ways to do that.
