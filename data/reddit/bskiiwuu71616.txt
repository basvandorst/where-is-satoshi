Does anyone know if crypto to crypto is a taxable event prior 2018 or did this start Jan. 1, 2018? Still after heard back from my CPA. Not sure if he really knows either.

Euphoric dopamine overload.

I'm seriously confused because adoption rate has not increased by that much so who's buying it for $8000 I don't understand it makes no sense to me right now. 
I mean if we're being honest it's not that convenient to use for every day day today transactions so I do not understand
What is really driving the price is it because there's only A limited supply and supply and demand I do not understand
I do not understand because I don't know if it's a currency or an asset class
People keep saying that it's a bubble it's a bubble it's a bubble it's a bubble it's a bubble it's a bubble it's a bubble but the bubble never pops I don't understand
I mean it pops it goes down $2000 but then it goes back up 5000 so I don't understand
What am I gonna use bitcoin for in real life well if I hold it could be a store of value I could easily transfer it to my relatives when I die but what else I don't understand
People are saying that bitcoin is better than gold and I get that you can divide up into eighths decimal places and I can send just a little piece of it across the world and I guess I have to wait I don't know what is it 10-60 minutes but still that's a lot better than an ounce of gold in the mail having to trust a carrier 
People like to say that bitcoin is like the tulip bubble but I don't even understand that either because obviously a tulip has no intrinsic value because it dies if it doesn't get any sunlight so I don't understand obviously theyre making a reference to the FOMO bubble but still there really wasn't any underlying asset worth anything
And then I looked and I see that bitcoin could add lightning networks and off chain transactions which makes everything a lot faster and lower fees but again I don't understand because are we going for currency or asset class I don't get it.

I don't think it's that crazy anymore. Honestly think you lowered your risk getting out of the fiat banking system.

That's my only fear...a quantum computer being able to find a weakness and undermine the algorithm.

Isn't it like gold because there's a finite amount and you have to mine it and it cost about $1000 to even create a bitcoin people have to spend electricity to even make bitcoin so it's just like gold how you have to go out to the farm put your tractor there it's been hours and hours and hours digging up in mining and shaking dirt till you might just find a particle gold and that takes a lot of time and effort in labor and it's the labor that determines the price, right?

Who's paying 8K for one bitcoin I do not get it. I understand on the log scale the graph looks OK I just do not understand have we reach the masses is this the end
I don't understand because it doesn't look like adoption is occurring it looks like the same number of users are still here 
I don't understand how to value one bitcoin I have nothing to base it on and it's confusing me￼
What are people using bitcoin for right now is it to store a value or the transfer of wealth from country to country I do not understand
People using bitcoin as currency or store value which one has more potential to be the outcome or both still?
Is bitcoin an asset class or a Curren$y ?

I just rambled off all the negative things people have said or told me about bitcoin as sarcasm. I think that's why it got upvoted. I wonder what they'll be saying at 10k. I personally believe 25k 2018 isn't that crazy now it's only about x4 currently and we x7 this year alone. I'm sold on the s-curve exponential growth and totally agree with you 100%. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:27:58
Who's going to pay 10k for 1 Bitcoin? I heard 1% of the world only owns $100 or less in bitcoin. This is crazy. So only 21 million people can own a full bitcoin? That blows my mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:05:34
And it can't be a currency because it's too volatile 
It's a bubble it's going to crash
It's like a tulip flower �� &lt;---best one I've heard
