Say I got rich for some reason and I could retire tomorrow. I'd quit my job right away. That's not to say that I'm just gonna be sitting on my ass for the rest of my life not contributing to society.
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:12:54
Yea that was pretty accurate. 
 
I also didn't read it
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:11:06
Fuck. That. 27 here, I wish I was economically safe and could retire tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:49:04
Stay down please. Paycheck comes in three days
@_date: 2019-10-08 05:35:10
I was hoping it would stay down until next paycheck. Damn

Myeaa, this is not the first time I hear about this 4chan wizard. I might not have had bitcoin for a very long time, but I've dabbled in the stockmarket before. And I've seen people raising stocks to the sky, "fool proof" ideas that end up running out in the sand. I believe in bitcoin. But I don't have much faith in people

And fees. But I suppose that's the sour apple you'll have to eat if you want to get your shit back. Or you could just leave it there and hope that it works out in the future. But... Yea

What does this mean?

What is this thing?

That's super cool. Would it be fair to call the bottle wallet an online wallet? Kinda like electrum (which I have) only that it kinda looks for that code "!bottle" and then send that a mount straight to someone's account without putting the wallet codes. It makes it a lot more easy access and I think this is a good way to get more uninterested people interested. 
  


 
You're cool, dude. Which definitely is a tippable offense! !bottle 100 sat  
I guess you didn't catch my edit in the last post. Why didn't the bot come out for you and say holy smokes batman and stuff? Did I type it wrong? The sats left my account
 
In the end if I manage to save up some sats in the bottle app, is it possible to transfer them over to my electrum wallet or hardware wallet? Or do those not count as lightning networks?
@_date: 2019-10-06 21:18:17
Do a lot of people go to 4chan for investment advice?
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:24:03
Hahaha dude... That ending though.
 
I'm impressed by how much you seem to know about this. You've definitely given me some "new" terms that I need to study up on. I'll admit I kinda threw myself into bitcoin without knowing enough. Thank you again

Didn't even watch the video yet, but I appreciate the translation. Thanks

Can I help you with the survey without logging in through my Gmail account?
@_date: 2019-10-20 08:11:52
Thank you very much for introducing this to me, and for answering all my questions. You're awesome. 
 
Last question. If I'd like to send say 350 dollars to my friend. Can I use the bottle joint through telegram to just hit him up with it? Or is that too high amounts?
@_date: 2019-10-07 12:21:44
Awesome bro! Thank you! I'm saving this comment and will return to it once my nano arrives. I didnt know how user friendly it would be for a beginner like myself. 
  
Once i have the hardware wallet, is it easy enough as setting it up, storing the keys, and then just hiding the wallet? I don't need to do anything else? 
   
Just one more thing then. I just downloaded electrum off of the play store on my android. So far there's been no problems, but I've only put bitcoin in it never tries to take it out yet.
@_date: 2019-10-08 17:39:43
Most definitely. Still a bargain for a hodler.

Hello! I also just started today. I've bought the [Ledger Nano X]( which is supposedly one of the best ones. I don't know much, really, but the way I understand it is that by using app wallets your money is kind of in the hands of whatever the app is. And they could do a runner or something. But by getting your own hardware wallet, it's more in your own hands.   
   
I was gonna try to invest a little more than I'm comfortable trusting anyone with. So I want "my own" wallet. 
 
Someone, please tell me everything I got wrong.

Im seeing this a lot on this sub. What is this? Reddit crypto? ����
@_date: 2019-10-07 12:22:09
I like this explanation

Hello! I use electrum as a virtual wallet. But I have a nano s on the way. Is it easy to transfer my bitcoin from electrum to the nano s? And is there something special I should look out for?
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:46:05
How do you mean? I ordered it off of their own website. Would they sell fake Nanos?
@_date: 2019-10-08 17:39:13
Interesting! It should arrive tomorrow or the day after, I'll look into it. Thanks for the warning :)
@_date: 2019-10-08 08:12:55
Thank you
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:34:03
Hi! I just received my nano and thought you might find [this]( interesting
@_date: 2019-10-20 07:18:55
Hah! You did the thing to me! I'm sorry for sounding stupid, but english is a second language. "tipping bot" I understand. It's like you just "tipped" me. What does "leveraging lightning network" mean? Also, what do I do with my new 300 reddit money? Coke and hookers for everyone! 
 
Edit: I clicked the link from the bot and read up. sats=Satoshis, and the bottle network kinda makes it very easy to "tip" or send sats to people. I think I get it now, and that is super fucking cool! The website itself gave me 1000sats for signing up or whatever. I would never get them without you, so I think it's only fair you get your monies back.
!bottle 300 sat 
 
Thank you for introducing this to me!

Well, the title is pretty much exactly what it is. Bitcoin videos being taken down or flagged. I didn't say all videos mentioning bitcoin are being taken down. 
 
I've been listening to this guy for a little while, and saw this video within the first hour it was posted and put it up here to get a clearer understanding. Which has helped a lot.
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:53:42
I'm not really screaming about anything.
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:43:48
He brought this up in the video I linked, and mentioned he had gotten tips to post on the decentralized "YouTube" instead. But pointed out that the masses are on YouTube. And that's who they want to reach
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:42:01
pointed out something similar in a Twitter post from someone where someone else had replied that none of their videos had been taken down where he discussed without trading advice. I hope this would be it, even if it might not be optimal. Do people get all their trading advice from YouTube? Would they take it down if I made a video that simply was me saying "invest your house in apple! Cus why the hell not"
@_date: 2019-12-25 16:16:21
Well put, and quite insightful. Thank you for the response
@_date: 2019-12-25 14:01:58
Any ideas why? This feels shady
@_date: 2019-12-25 16:15:46
Hahaha I appreciate the thought. But nah, I've never put anything on YouTube. But I've been watching his videos and some more crypto-posters almost daily.
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:45:34
I didn't know this and I really appreciate you pointing that out. Could you direct me to a better, less "shilly" YouTuber that does crypto videos? I also like krons crypto cave. What do you think about him? Alright or nah?
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:09:07
That's a fair point. Especially the money aspect of it. But I feel people on a decentralized system are more inclined to already be into bitcoin. Know how I mean?
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:09:38
I'll check him out. Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-12-25 17:42:33
Appreciate the link! I really hope it's not as shady as it felt for me.
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:19:14
Huh... Well, yeah. That's true. I didn't think about it like that, however simple it sounds now that you mention it. Still though, YouTube has a lot of viewers. You can't expect to get the same sort of views on a smaller site disregarding if it's better or not. Anyhow, what would be your recommendation for best place to get good bitcoin news/updates?
@_date: 2019-12-26 18:52:14
Huh... Interesting. Nah I didnt get this
@_date: 2019-12-25 20:13:09
I've never heard about this app before creating this thread. I'll have to check it out. Thanks for the tip :)
