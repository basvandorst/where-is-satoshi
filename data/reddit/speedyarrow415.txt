Makes sense why Jeff Garzik announced his own project on October 24th. They knew about this for at least a month.

EOS is a scam, only raised so much because of arbitrage bots

It's definitely not better at fungibility if it can be blacklisted by exchanges 
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:59:00
Since it's a year long ico, bots have been buying eos everyday and dumping them on exchanges the next day for profit when tokens are calculated and released. This has resulted in 15-20m being raised everyday.

I know a guy that just had his online wallet hacked. Don't be dumb, use a nano ledger

You need 2fa Authenticator on your email, then disable text/phone recovery. Hackers are getting into people’s emails through people’s phone carriers. Call your phone carrier and ask if there were any recent changes to your account and reverse them. Make sure your texts arent being forwarded to another number

1.) If you use Gmail, enable 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) in Settings. First it requires you to activate phone/text recovery before you can activate the Google Authenticator app. Once you enable both phone/text recovery and Google Authenticator, go back into your settings and DELETE phone/text recovery! Most people accidentally leave this on! If a hacker gains access to your phone number by calling your carrier, you are fucked if this is on. Also do this to your backup email. Make sure to save a set of Backup keys to get back into your gmail.
2.) your carrier will let a hacker back into your account over and over again until you switch carriers. It doesn’t matter if you have a pin, they will use your publicly available social security number or some other trick to get in.
