Which is why it’s up to the individual, or some statistical model they agree with, to decide what they consider dead or not.
Even those known burner addresses may have their keys guessed in future with advances in quantum computing (maybe), solving a millennium equation (maybe), sheer luck in a 2^256 guess per attempt (maybe).
All of these things are — quintessentially and crucially — above zero chance of happening, therefore possible.

There are some known burner addresses that no one has the private key to, for example this address which currently has ~2 130 BTC:
Bitcoin on these addresses is almost entirely gone in the sense that the only way to get it is to guess a 2^256 number and hope it’s the private key that can seed for that address.
Otherwise, it’s essentially “how long before we consider no _outbound_ transactions to mean there’s a good chance the private key is lost?”
Without some statistical chain analysis on the velocity of Bitcoin (how fast it is spent once received; how fast it changes hands) it really is a feel-it-out-thing. 1 year? 2 years? 5 years? It’s up to you.

Ring signatures are nothing more than obfuscation; i.e not private. These guys can just use a DEX into a zkSnarks coin and then back into BTC if there is limited liquidity for their purpose.

"An important note is that the Ethereum virtual machine is Turing-complete; this means that EVM code can encode any computation that can be conceivably carried out, including infinite loops."

I gave them both a quick scroll on their home and about pages; I don't see why I would tokenise on anything other than say Ethereum or Stellar (if I didn't need turing completeness) with regards to Thor Chain.
Ethereum _is_ the world computer and applications which require turing complete functionality can take advantage of it, and if they don't they have Stellar.
REN seems cool for cross chain communication, but the point remains that if you need to compute things in a trustless manner with turing completeness use Ethereum and if you need distributed storage then IPFS _is_ the solution.
