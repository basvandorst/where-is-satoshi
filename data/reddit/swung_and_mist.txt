They're telling the average Joe that -- first of all, that all those homeless people you see on the side of the road represent "full employment" -- and also that thanks to the wonders of Amazon and Uber, there is no consumer price inflation anymore.  None.  It's solved.  Inflation over.
Of course, everyone knows that's only true so long as you don't have to buy housing, education, healthcare, or food.  Because those things are under MASSIVE inflation.

Yo dipshit, everyone knows all that.  We're apparently disagreeing over the definition of the word counterfeit.  Yours is wrong.
@_date: 2019-08-20 17:27:19
you're right.  I was thinking of something else more specific.
@_date: 2019-08-16 14:18:36
I wouldn't go that far.
As far as we know, global-scale, immutable PoS blockchains don't exist, and maybe never will.  There is certainly no example of one today - Ethereum is the closest and even if it wins on the PoS front, it loses on the governance front.
I personally wouldn't want to see Bitcoin EVER move away from PoW of some kind.  The block reward MUST be tied to the real world somehow or it's just not gonna work.  For example:
Say Bitcoin switches over to PoS, tomorrow.  That's $200 Billion in staked tokens.  That's a drop in the bucket for the US government.  They buy up all the bitcoin, and become the largest stakeholder.  (Note they've not broken any rules of the network so far).  They then execute a hard fork causing the supply to inflate to infinity, or censor transactions, or double spend, or burn all the bitcoins, or whatever they want.  (Note they've STILL not broken any rules of the network).
Now, with Bitcoin the way it is, if the US government (or anyone) wanted to do something similar, they'd have to commandeer every power plant in N America or some shit.
Huge difference.

Edit: "made in exact imitation of something valuable or important with the intention to deceive or defraud."
"a fraudulent imitation of something else; a forgery."
Sorry, a double spend is still counterfeit money.  The second transaction is a phony imitation (of a legitimate transaction) and the intent is to deceive.
You're pissing on your own shoes.  I have a thesaurus and a Farmers almanac handy if you want me to check those.
Edit 2:.  Good explanation of UTXO tho.  Hopefully someone will find this thread informational. :)
@_date: 2019-08-16 13:31:06
No.  Non-PoW networks can never be immutable because there's no unforgeable costliness associated with the token.  For example, if majority of stakeholders decide to rewrite the chain from scratch, there's nothing to prevent them from doing this.  PoW prevents bitcoin miners from doing this, even if 100% of them wanted to.
\* Ethereum may be a special case because ETH started off as a PoW token and so has "intrinsic value" so maybe it can be converted to PoS later.  However, we can hardly call Ethereum "immutable" anyway since they hard fork it anytime they like.
(I use Ethereum myself, but not for money.  ETH is more like oil than gold, if you ask me.  Oil is useless by itself but makes machines work, just like ETH makes smart contracts work)

The real inflation rate is about 17%.  CPI is a ludicrous lie.  If you can't see thru that, you don't have enough life experience to be making calls like this.
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:25:52
S2F models puts 'intrinsic' price at around $6500 today.  And historically, BTC doesn't reach halfway point of previous ATH until after halving.  We're way ahead of schedule (i.e., in a bubble).
A drop to $6500 is very possible between now and December.  But whatevs.  I'm sure you know what you're doing.
