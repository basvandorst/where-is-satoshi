jea okay i thought the same that on long time youl get profit more easy then in short time with amore gamblingish style.  
I also think that btc has a good future, but why should it go to 0€? Thats a point  i think about very often. What need to happen to "destroy btc"?

There are three things wich can happen:  
1. Ebay card is "Carded" (was bought with stolen credit card) and you can use it just like a normal card.  
2. Ebay card is "Carded" and you get in trouble because they think you did that. (Account banned)  
3. He is just a scammer

When is the best time to buy btc in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:39:17
Jea! Noone can know the right time to buy btc... but everyone has a own opinion WHY they bought at  a specific time.
