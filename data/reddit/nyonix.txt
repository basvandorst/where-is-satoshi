Isn't locking Bitcoins in a smartcontract and borrowing from it a lot easier? You wouldn't incour on any gain taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:08:07
So what happens when the contract is up?
Say i buy a 1 futures contract for january and hold it up to january, what will happen?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:19:51
So futures are just bets, nothing more. Thank you for your time kind sir.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:01:10
Is the bitcoin bought at the moment of the contract or when the contract date comes up?
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:52:09
Funny, people keep using ETH hard fork as an example,in the end, wasnt the longest chain called ETH ?
Edit: typo

I think its only difficult cuz it was never done,
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:28:57
Inaction is to blame for this, and that involves  2 communities, don't be a kid, and say "They started it!".

You don't cash out, you buy out, buy stuff Whit the cryptos your bullish, and your living life at a discount, the rest just hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:36:04
I agree with you, but in order for this to happen, fees must go down on the same order of magnitude.

Take another p2p technology, torrents, the government's failed to stop it even though they put some people in jail. 
Now OP post in not intierly correct, government's could ban centralized exchanges which would reduce daily transactions rate significantly, but stop it , that would mean taking the whole internet down, can they do that?
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:47:27
Exactly, this war is escalating to the point that I could totally see something like that happening.

Use Electrum, it will support both chains in case there is a split.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:45:05
This downvote was not hacked, blaming an entire sub for someone action is just adding more wood to the fire.
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:44:56
Exodus is a light wallet, a full wallet requires you to download the whole blockchain to your computer, might take some time, but you'r safer this way.
The safest way is a hardware wallet, i advise Ledger nano S, since they already said they will support both chains if a split occurs.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:35:59
That's the thing , either parties do not exclude the other party solution, just the timetable.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:05:35
I said i was sorry :(
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:59:46
This is FUD all the way. It has no replay protection because it's an upgrade to the Bitcoin network, it's not a split, like Bitcoin Cash. The fact that it has the majority of miners agreement, but does not have community consensus, and Core Client Devs agreement makes it a problematic Fork, so call it for what it is.
Best option is to not move your coins during the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:42:24
My account was hacked to downvote this, password was too easy, sorry :/
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:45:57
So anything below that is considered spam?
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:39:33
What i'm saying is OP was accurate expressing the opinion of one part, that does not mean he is right, not even accurate on the facts, so yeah a bias post.
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:55:18
Everyone was already expecting a big dip after Bitcoin all time high, it's a cycle, now it's gaining resistance to new dips, then it will reach a new ATH.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:11:25
 it's stupid to think that BCH consensus does not want sidechains, it may not need it right now or any time soon,but it will happen, it's  I just a matter of priorities. Bitcoin gave priority to sidechains and other things, whille no one is totally denying bigger block, just pushing it to the future has a need basis.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:07:28
Any government would enforce the use of National currency if hyperinflation was happening, but yeah I know what you mean.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:51:51
You mean someone develops a client that has all those "features" and every user would just goble it up because they can't move to another client or blockchain?
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:14:54
I agree with you,I also prefer descentralized systems, but code must be improved, and for that you need a leadership that works, roadmaps to look at what's coming.
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:51:48
You are right, poor people will have a problem running a full node, so will any regions with limited internet access, but that will always be a problem no matter what btc client is used, those are issues not related to this problem, and there are already other blockchains that address this , like iconomy.
@_date: 2017-09-22 08:10:55
Depends on the time frame. as far as I know, beside hardware wallets, there aren't any full clients that support many cryptos, and installing full clients for each one is a tiring process, I know that because I was in the same position as you some months ago. Ledger nano s is your best option, but it doesn't have all coins, so start by moving the ones the ledger does not have. As for the ones  ledger supports,just  be patient and wait for it, bittrex is one of the best exchanges I know, you can have them safe for a couple of months.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:56:13
So miners can in effect read/write, while full nodes can only read, correct?
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:29:18
Actually, I think now  it's at 9%,(are following me?) , But the blocks are almost full, fees are are high, although not at a ATH, mempool is 5Gb ( how many 1MB, 10m blocks do you need to clear that)  and this is not a new problem, it's old in IT time . If segwit came to solve all this, it's going to take a while, and that's a big if, but I hope it does.
Tell me, if you want to transfers value between exchanges, do you use bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:30:45
You should learn how  Bitcoin works. A Full node provides security to a user or users that use that node, not to all, miners provide security to all the network.
Seriously i have friends coming to me saying their coins are safe because they store it directly in the blockchain... In blockchain.info.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:29:51
Understand the technology, Keep reading without taking sides, read from different sources and compare, pass no judgment on to others, specially character judgments, hold for long term in cold or hardware wallets.
My take until now is, both sides have valid technical reasons, both sides have people with lots to gain. Blockchain is the Future.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:33:25
First part correct. Accurate? Only from certain a point of view.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:14:41
What would say people buy it because of the economics of it, store of value, with a unbeatable security.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:37:31
Segwit is a Wow expansion, while Segwit2x is Wow 2, a new game, but you can import your heroes from Wow
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:17:37
I don't get this, sure it's not a simple setup a full node, downloading a blockchain might take a while, but out of resources, expensive, where is this coming from??? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:02:08
Please correct me if i'm wrong.
When a miner gets the right answer, he writes in the block and broadcast it to the entire network , all other nodes must then look at all requests and its own ledger and see which "right answer" was first, according to the time-stamp, when enough confirmations are done it is considered verified.
Edit: grammar errors
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:52:23
I do not like the fact that banks are behind this new client, but like it or not,  if the majority of miners follows it, then by code rules they have consensus, let's hope they stay honest. You can't call it an attack just because you don't like them. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:01:32
What? what do you mean by "The network is the longest VALID chain."?
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:47:24
i assumed Segwit would allow more transactions per block, reducing pressure on high fees.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:28:26
You would prefer to play Maraudon with lag?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:51:07
Reward is given after a few blocks are confirmed, how many i do not know, but i know merchants can increase the number of confirmations needed to add more security.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:27:36
Exactly, i'm not too keen on a group supported by banks, but I also don't like the "whatever it takes stance"  just so you can stay in power. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:51:00
But points of view is what put us in the same problem, you can never know for sure where the majority is,  if a minority has enough power, it can subvert the intent. Voting would be the best way, but how could you prevent fake voting? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:55:29
So you're telling me Coins like Monero or Eth are not asic resistant? 
I'm not saying change the algorithm, what i'm saying is, you can't change the rules of consensus without changing the algorithm, things like "economic consensus" is just nonsense because in light of the code, it means nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:12:20
So the "network" should be able to change the rule that tells everyone to follow the longest chain, the one that has more valid work, you know, more miners. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:19:09
I agree with you, but now we're talking about money, and a whole lot a responsibility that comes with it, the indendence from the bank institutions will have a high learning curve , but next generation will be faster.
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:14:26
So change the code to reflect that.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:40:02
I follow both subs, and what amazes more is the confidence of some people while saying nonsense after nonsense, like blind men talking about the light that someone told them about and now they think they see.
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:26:57
I know Segwit is opt-in, with Segwit transactions at 7%  how long do you think it take until it will cause a significant impact on the Network?
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:15:09
Emergency difficulty adjustment
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:20:42
I think you mean to say no algorithm is asic immune, resistant means exactly what you're saying regarding you need to put a lot more money into development. And yes, I hope more companies join in like Russian and Japan techs to eliminate China centralization, but still, the problem addressed here is consensus . 
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:04:51
An agreement that includes the majority of the miners is still under the consensus rules of the code, it doesn't matter if it's closed or open doors. Understand one thing, if the code doesn't work, change it, but if it's there it must be used in every situation or it will not abide a descentralized system.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:59:35
But anyone with enough time and money can fake support on either side,  how can we tell the difference?
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:59:12
You'r talking about math when most prefer to talk about politics, Kudos for your patience.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:12:03
As time passes and new generations get older, people tend to be more knowledgeable towards IT, specially as GUIs get better and learning curves are reduced.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:22:26
Same graphics engine, just with bigger storage in your inventory
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:56:39
Why do you consider it an attack?
@_date: 2017-10-06 12:35:15
Bitmain mining power is a direct consequence of developers not addressing the algorithm problem. Why not change to an algorithm to be asic resistant? Oh right you  aft to hard fork for that. You can't just let it happen and then say is someone else's fault. You can't have an algorithm that follows the biggest chain and then cry fault because the winner played by the book but just has more money than you.
Edits: misspells, lots of them
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:01:15
Sorry, I have not, imagine there must be a lot, this is a great project , one that I believe will change the internet, but I know that only a few can actually upload the code to the client, and most use this client ,so there's a centralization factor without an actual leader, do you think we would be in this mess if Satoshi was present? Nothing is certain of course , but odds say it would be better.   This is not the case, and I am not the one for sure, but to imagine better things for all is what I do, and I believe leaders come naturally, and I also believe that right now we have administrators, not leaders. I hope for better times, is it 2x? hmm I also have my doughts.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:12:20
You fail to understand the necessity of all following the same rules under a descentralized system, you disregard code rules over market/community consensus, when it's clearly known that PoW algorithm was created because it is possible to fake market/community consensus.
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:18:46
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:49:20
Full nodes help to validate transactions to anyone that connects to it, it does not help with the centralization of miners, if miners decide to change their client  which has a new set of rules, your full node becomes  incompatible, so you must update your client also so it keeps doing it's job.
Mining centralization can only be solved by changing the consensus rules, like btc gold is doing changing their algorithm.
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:29:02
Isn't it true that the big dips were cause by hacks on exchange or exchanges failing?
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:02:02
Bear in mind I'm no specialist in blockchain, I'm a lurker most of the times, i hold Bitcoins, i do not mine bitcoins anymore.
For me more than anything , having 2 split communities is the more damage dealer,  I don't know what is really happening, if there is an unrealistic censor in r/Bitcoin, or if r/BTC is being controlled by players that have different agendas than what a majority want. 
What I know is that the ability to prune your ledger might be a vulnerability for 51% attack, but does not mean everyone will do it nor that it will be needed. It's a feature that assigns trust to another party, like any web wallet.
The ability to increase the block size does not mean bitcoin does not need sidechains.
Just because we have sidechains does not mean we can't have bigger blocks. 
My only concern is if sidechains take Bitcoin transaction fees, how is the main chain supported? Now the block reward might be enough  for any miner, but eventually fees will be the bigger slice in miners rewards, how will that be solved?
More and more,  consensus on a group is to require a feature from Bitcoin, while the other group disagrees raising security issues, but demanding a different features for end users, Wich raises security issues from the other party. Do you see a pattern here?
Problem: increase transactions validation speed, while lowering fees.
Solution 1: sidechains,  wich accomplish both and eliminates the need for bigger blocks on main chain.
Side-effect: no trustless network, private chain control, main chain looses fee revenues.
Solution 2: bigger blocks 
Side-effect: open to spam attacks, more hard drive space needed.
My opinion is that both solutions are needed, one solutions keeps the other in check and users can not be ignorant of their choices, be it to prune their ledger or to accept bigger blocks. 
Do you think we would be having this kind of problems if Satoshi was present?
@_date: 2017-06-26 16:15:58
I think it will be a progressive change, first retail banks will start having crypto wallets, but  people will eventually realize they don't need them, specially when new ways of getting loans start showing up. Lending is the biggest business for banks, not saving money. When new lending services allow people to lend money to others with low risk, then this will make a difference, and that's when you'll see retail banks being eaten by other banks, until we are left with whales that will most be for investments.

I don't recommend Poloniex, my support ticket is 13 days old, I read ppl with +40 days tickets.
