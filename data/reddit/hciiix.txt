I wrote the below comment on your last update, but you didn't respond. Can you address some concerns.
1. What is your actual plan?
2. How will BTC help ordinary Cypriots?
3. What support can they expect?
4. How will they acquire BTC?
5. How will they cash out if they need fiat desperately?
6. If they only have e.g. EUR 500 in cash now, how will changing this to BTC help them? Why not just transact with cash?

What does "fart sniiiiiiif" mean? lol
But yeah, you make a good point otherwise.
How about if we gave a standard tip in cash plus an extra BTC amount like this? That way the server doesn't resent the gesture, and update of BTC will grow.

Piękny! Skąd kupiłaś?
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:30:34
eBay may be an option then.
I've purchased BTC successfully on eBay, despite the anti-eBay/Paypal sentiment here. I'm very happy with my experiences so far (BTC was sent and initial confirmations within a few hours.)
Find a seller with a good rating, and don't got for obviously lowball prices.
You'll need an established eBay profile and verified Paypal account before serious sellers will trade with you.

The US government has no reciprocal tax agreement with other nations?
That's a strange system, as other governments will demand tax too if you are a resident of their country, so you'll be taxed twice.

But none of us can claim that bitcoin is 'relatively stable'. No one knows what it will do from one day to the next.

This is a concept I'm still trying to get my head around.
I thought BTC was completely fungible, and therefore merge-able, but now I'm reading about "outputs" and how I cannot pay for a 2.99 BTC item with 3.00 BTC because of strange fees imposed on fractions.
I'm not a stupid man, but this has me totally confused. I can understand the concept of "dust" as tiny transactions or even tiny wallet balances, but I don't understand why hundreds of dust don't add together to balance that doesn't incur fees.
It's definitely a barrier of adoption for the average man.

Is it too late to comment and get a tip? I've just discovered BTC and am stoked about the potential.
And thanks in advance!

I agree, it blows my mind just thinking about the implications of crypto-decentralised currencies. The theoretical idea that I can walk naked* ANYWHERE and spend credits from a wallet stored in my brain is mind-blowing.
I've not felt this excited since I was a little boy, dreaming about sci-fi and space. BTC may not survive, but the idea cannot be put back in the box and it's a gamechanger for so many things.
* i.e. *naked* to illustrate I'm not carrying anything of value.
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:25:34
Nice designs :-)  Yeah, a 5 minute video can really help adoption with things like this.  Thank you for the internets!

What happens in case of dispute? Both parties leave money in limbo, but the buyer gets the product?
What incentive does the buyer have (beyond common decency) to send the encrypted key once they have the goods?

Great question.
Tax is important to the functioning of any nation state, but Bitcoin doesn't change the situation as much as you think.
Tax can and is applied to a few things, depending on where you live in the world:
* income
* capital gains
* investment income
* wealth
* consumption
* and even just on transactions.
Consumption is covered with VAT, and is factored into the price you pay for your shopping. The seller must account for the value of what has been sold and pass along your VAT. So this doesn't change.
Taxing wealth is a hugely controversial issue, and doesn't happen in most countries. I won't go into this now, as it's a minefield.
Income tax is either taken at the point of employer payment to employees (and again, this wouldn't change if BTC became the defacto salary currency) **or** income is declared in the form of an annual tax return, and you tell the government how much you earned.
So the question that lies underneath your question is really: how can the government make sure we are honest in our tax returns? ... and that question exists today as much as it would in a BTC society.
Now capital gains tax (CGT) is a tricky one. BTC is essentially an investment for many people, but like any CGT, it isn't taxed until the income is fully realised (i.e. when you convert your BTC into cash.) If you never do that, and if you continue to use BTC as a genuine transactional currency, than you need never worry about it. Just like you are not taxed if your dollar/pounds/euro increase in value.
And so we come to transactional tax. Where the government takes a cut of every single transaction that takes place, regardless of whether money is being made or not. Think like Paypal fees. This may be the future of tax in a crypto-currency world, along with complex IRS *spiders* to investigate the public ledgers (blockchains in BTC's case).


I don't know, but it's here, and we can't put the technology back in the box and forget about it.
At the moment, anonymous BTC addresses need to plug in to the *real world* to be funded or cashed out, but the real shake up occurs when BTC facilities tha full spectrum... paid in BTC, save in BTC, spend in BTC. That's when it gets really interesting.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:37:57
I know, that's why I said disregarding the limit. It's just meant to be a fun read.
@_date: 2013-04-29 13:38:21
No no, I agree that the fees are fair.
My question was...


Don't you think that this is very technical, almost abstract, and therefore a barrier to most people?
Most people are willing to pay reasonable fees. But they generally need to understand:
a) how the fees are calculated
b) who collects the fees
It's a little arbitrary that Bill's transaction of 1BTC and Bob's transaction of 1BTC may be comprised of different input 'denominations' and therefore subject to different fees.
Personally, I'd much prefer a fee imposed on ALL transactions, rather than the above situation. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 06:41:42
It's a tiny amount (0.001BTC = ~$0.14) but the technical barrier for entry into using Bitcoin is so high that there's no way I would have starting using it any other way.
@_date: 2013-04-30 16:53:19
Wax seals and signet rings! Man, I knew they'd come back around if I only waited long enough.
@_date: 2013-04-29 12:03:12
Ah, thanks. I don't think I'm any wiser for knowing that :) 
@_date: 2013-05-01 14:44:34
Totally agree. I can't wait!
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:19:36
Whoa, sorry there. Replied to the wrong comment!
It's cool you're pushing security, but Bitcoins are money. It's serious stuff.

That little gesture is straight up responsible for me getting the BTC bug... without it, everything is just theoretical and vague. With my REDEEM KARMA, I was able to learn about addresses, test receiving funds, and test sending BTC by transfering them between wallets (and learning about fees!).
I'll pay it forward as soon as I get my head around buying BTC and security, both by tips and supporting bitcointip with a donation well beyond the 0.001 I received. I'd like to get the 0.15 contribution so I can tip in all subreddits too.
Funnily enough, that 0.001 gesture has made me feel a bit beholden to the community. It's not enough to do anything meaningful with except learn the ropes! I think it's a great idea.

The thing is you have a lot of very scared, very angry, and very sceptical people in Cyprus now. Rightfully so.
At the slightest hint of problems, Bitcoin will get a terribly bad reputation as a contributing factor to the financial turmoil over in Cyprus, if it contributes to peoples' problems.
Your national money is being watched very carefully by many governments and authorities. Transfers, withdrawals, investments etc. are basically crippled at the state level.
It's a terrible time to convince hard-working Cypriots to put what little they can salvage into a roller-coaster crypto-currency.
Who's going to take responsibility if it pops again? Who's going to tell those desperate people not to worry if everything crashes a second time?
You sound full of passion for both Cyprus and BTC, but please be cautious and considerate as you move forward.

redditor for 44 minutes. That was his first comment. Nothing more than a troll.
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:02:35
Thanks for these answers. You sound like you've got your head firmly attached with regards to this.
Personally, I think you should put together a good manifesto, much like above but in more detail. It will be very useful to include in a presspack, which you can then use to encourage press coverage, publicity, donations and further trust.
The news wires are pretty much looking for Cyprus/Bitcoin leads - [See this BBC feature story a few days ago](


This is a great start. There will be some very intelligent people there, and perhaps an idea may be to work towards establish a network of passionate representatives in Paphos, Nicosia, Larnaca, Polis, Limassol, and somewhere in Famagusta. They can speak with local businesses and you'll have a team to bounce ideas off. It will make everything a bit more legitimate too and take some of the load off you.
* Listen
* Discuss
* Support
And good luck. I've been there a few times and would love to buy a mezzo in BTC the next time I've over!

I would welcome the ability to change the USD equivalent to other currencies before printing them. EUR, GBP, AUD etc.
It's a currency without borders after all.
@_date: 2013-04-29 09:44:16
Thank you. That's the first explanation that has made any sense to me :)
Do you think this is something that future mainstream BTC users shouldn't have to worry about, if BTC are ever to become widely accepted?
I mean, the fee seems fair and all, but I wish there was some way to simplify the process. I feel like I have to keep minute track of my outputs just as much as I do my balance or the price of the goods/service.
@_date: 2013-04-30 13:29:27
Thanks for this well thought out response. I'm still wading my way through the bitcoin minefield :)
@_date: 2013-04-30 17:02:10
But they can smell the demand for BTC. They must have a lot of customers mentioning it. I think it's fair to say they (and other platforms) are tasking themselves with bringing this to market in a profitable way asap.

FinCEN only has American jurisdiction, doesn't it?
It's becoming very apparent that governments don't have the legal tools available to tackle BTC in the way they have done with traditionally fiat.
These regulations aren't worth the paper they're written on, if they cannot be enforced.
Man, these are interesting times and I'm happy to be a witness to it. I really believe we're standing on the edge of a new era of society.

Are you willing to trust hundreds/thousands of your money on free software?
I use Microsoft Security Essentials (free) + Sandboxie (free-ish) + shadow defender (paid) + onscreen keyboard for typing passwords (comes with every OS) ... but none of that matters if you have an advanced keylogger sitting on your system.
