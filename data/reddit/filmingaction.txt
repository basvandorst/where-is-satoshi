I'm sure the concept has been around for 100s of years. Your point? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:43:53
I sold for Stellar, so I'm good. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:26:57
Elon Musk hates cryptos, he'd never accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:20:08
I'm glad I sold. This is a political mess. 
None of the alts have these issues (yet).
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:39:39
One of the first discovered Bitcoin, it was worth $120. I gathered up 0.3 Bitcoin through tips and gambled it all away. Boo. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:24:56
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:08:31
Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:25:21
I sold at $3000 in Sept. and never re-bought :) 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:44:11
I'm doing the exact same as CNBC.

Spamming? Look at my post history. That is my first and only comment (other than this one) on this thread. You lied. That's a false affirmation, what mental disorder do you have? Absolutely no evidence. Your comment is now voided. 
Keep losing money. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:15:13
You don't. Stop. It's literally *only* a ponzi scheme if you consider it as only an investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:06:22

He's not wrong. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:42:52
i know, it's a shame bitcoin/bcash become this way
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:02:29
How to save your money in 4 simple steps:
* Put Bitcoin in bittex or binance
* Buy Ark at its current price (49k sats)
* Hold Ark
* Sell Ark back for Bitcoin when it's tripled in price. 
Edit: 51k sats now.

It's when a dead cat bounces.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:33:03
It's more about the rate of the drop that's concerning 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:34:44
Haha, everyone's losing money. I'm glad I sold!
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:44:00
Buy an alt.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:36:11
Right 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:58:38
It's a smaller coin that's currently ~$7, which can be bought on bittrex or binance. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:48:11
Well the first lightning wallet will need to be funded from somewhere, right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:05
Bull trap, warning warning 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:54:59
Buy high? Why would anyone do that?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:45:20
Because it'll go up the moment you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:40
Just sell and rebuy at $600
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:38:41
Wow that's amazing, only $30 ��
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:06:20


you didn't call it
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:07:20
What's your point? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:56
So now, buy back at $1,000
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:38:53

The cost of one bitcoin transaction is $125. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:00:44
Attacked, how?
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:37:42




@_date: 2017-12-21 19:33:32
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:48:23
That's me lol
I bought at 19.5k and sold at 12k. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:05:01
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:16:57
The cost per ONE transaction is now $125
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:55:17
No, that's just the average transaction cost. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:25
The average Bitcoin transaction is now $100.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:05:27
I made a similar comment 2 hours ago: 
And in that time frame, it's up 4%. While bitcoin plummets. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:48:04
Great, now it'll go up and not stop
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:39:29
It's called a gambling addiction 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:52:45
The bubble is popping. Dot com bubble all over again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:43:41
Dude, this isn't all at once. It's a minimum of 163 days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:59
Timberrr. Haha get fucked HODLers
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:41
Stabilize at $3000
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:55:38
It just did 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:05:50
this is hard
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:22:01


First things cops do when they find a dead body is contact the parents. The fact that the parents decided to randomly fly over, had a copy of his home key, and entered only to find his rotting body is too dramatic to be real.
This entire story was realistic until that point. I don't believe it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:06:18
More like, how many users don't want to pay $25 in fees per transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:55:27
Timberrr :)

How long would it take to get 100 million Bitcoin users into a lightning network? 
7 transactions per second, right? Assuming every single transaction was used to get a unique person into a lightning channel, it would take 163 days.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:22:38
Buy Ark. Ripple is bound to crash even harder than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:59:35
How long would it take to get 10 million Bitcoin users into a lightning netowkr? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:04:18
OP should post again letting people know that it's been solved .
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:42:55
$1000 is terrible pay for that kinda work
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:32:15


Well, isn't value is attained by people buying bitcoin rather than spending it...?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:05:21


catch the falling knife
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:00:50
That's less than 10% of daily volume
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:59:26
"I had to sell my Bitcoin because I was broke" 
So you don't see Bitcoin as money?
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:03:34
Huh, the angles are only 0, 30 and 60, intersting. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:06:28
Yes, using other currencies. ie Forex Markets 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:29:38
Difficulty adjustment. BCH will go down to $600ish for a few months before the next pump. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:12:50
You don't know when it's done. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:04:07
You only want it now that the price is up. Why didn't anyone want it when BCH was $300?
Why does the price alone dictate people's interest? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:35:57
That's just what happened last time it got pumped, except it was down to $300. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:12:40
I thought weak hands were wiped out at the September dip.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:19:04
$2300 in a few days :) 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:41:50
No, since they're mined by the same machines. If bitcoin cash becomes more profitable (which it is now), hash power goes to BCH. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:59:13
I sold in Sept lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:14:51
I sold at $3300
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:09


@_date: 2017-11-12 22:40:07
No not at all. That's @_date: 2017-11-12 05:19:22
And we blew right past it. Don't worry. Support at $3000.
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:01:38
But then again, youre a lady
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:35:08
How old are you? Did you get more matches when you started doing that lol 
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:46:22
I HODL because I'm lazy
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:34:11
Oh. So it didn't lead to more dates lol 
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:46:32
Does.. does it work? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:46:45
I do it, and it works. I don't even use my own address. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:01:07
Okay cool :) I'm glad it got you laid. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:38:09
I sold at $3300!
@_date: 2017-10-12 17:56:03
And bought ARK!!!
