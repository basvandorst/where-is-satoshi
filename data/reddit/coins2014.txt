So powerful that he fled the United States then fled back after facing criminal charges in Dubai?
Seems pretty powerful yo.

Ask them. It was documented on talk.btc.com extensively as well as Bitcoin Talk. They knew it was a fraud but still worked with him and helped him promote his scams.
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:09:41
Name names. What sites.
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:37:18
im going to call and request these documents that you found and see if they will give them to me and report back.
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:57:49
And with that you just earned a spot on my DNS host list blackhole. Stay classy. If you surfed around for more than just your own sites you would see both of those people are members of lots of other sites and have no connection to coinfire.
I just like what coinfire does like many others outside of the reddit community. They came in here and basically backed what you were saying and instead you took it to name calling.
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:05:26
LOL. With all of his new money from Matonis.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:30:07
Wasn't that easy?
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:30:35
LOL of course they will prosecute you. LOLOLOLOLOL
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:42:38
I feel like that has been the case with every porn site which is why they are charging more now up front with Bitcoin because they won't be able to do that.
If anything this will force all porn sites to be more honest about billing practices so I'll support them for that.
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:29:08
I just gave to Chain Radio today. They just got started, they seem to be building up a lot of new programming and I heard today they are investing in a CBAND dish and some sort of receiver to be able to bring in Free Talk Radio in the highest quality which is a major national show that supports bitcoin pretty heavily.
Bitcoin is so awesome for that sort of giving.
@_date: 2014-08-02 22:09:35
He claimed it was Gox connected.
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:34:53
that thread they posted is the biggest bs ever. they got caught and came to deny with a flimsy as fuck story. those screenshots could easily be faked. simply edit the elements in chrome.
@_date: 2014-08-02 21:52:15
Just because they know how to lie on reddit doesn't mean they aren't the mafia.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:28:39
Can't wait to try this out! Thanks for doing this!
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:05:56
LOL What if Max did invent it?!? ;)
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:07:51
Saw this on coinfire today and registered!
@_date: 2014-08-18 19:58:35
I hope that others see this and start to do the same. All of those other permissions are just unnecessary and show they care more about profiling you then giving you a private and secure wallet.
Thank you team.
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:37:46
thats creepy. i may have to read up on that.
@_date: 2014-08-13 13:26:33
Or just, ya know, like email someone trying to do something good and ask for source code to be posted on something audit-able.
Better yet though, just be a fucking asshole and discourage people from trying to do good. Great fucking plan.
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:36:28
Here ya go folks. The full text. Coin Fire's Plus page says all Plus paid stories are released for free at a later date but for those who just can't wait...
I still suggest you buy the paid service when you can. They give you access to see future stories on the backend.
@_date: 2014-08-06 20:39:34
Whoa whoa whoa. That link is a PDF. Beware.
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:20:19
You lyin' bro?
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:42:34
Yet, a CCN story is on the homepage again. Remember when people were mad because they were pumping GAW? Now they are calling for lawsuits to silence Coin Fire and yet somehow... somehow people keep voting them up to the homepage. Where is the outrage?
We all want to be outraged about a scam but no one wants to take the steps necessary to stop the people promoting that scam?
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:36:17
I kept seeing 
Now I see that is related to this. Awesome. I won't support the crooks supporting the crooks.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:38:54
It sends a clear message that this scam shouldn't be allowed to operate and further tarnish the community's name when it all comes crashing down.
Which it will.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:10:25
Now another one of your authors is dragging the site in to it and even calling Coin Fire names. Is it standard policy at CCN to do that? It sure seems to be happening a lot.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:37:56
Who cares if it is a free domain? It fits with the name Coin Fire. = .CF
I think they were being clever and since the WHOIS is private it indicates they paid the premium for the protected domain etc.
The guy Mike behind it has been met in person by many in the community. He is actually a real person.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:28:04
Promotes scam PAYCOIN.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:09:49
Thanks for sharing this information as I am a C1 customer. I'll be moving to a more friendly bank.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:19:48
Go visit the comments and tell them this is bullshit. Then never visit them again.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:34:51
It relates to BTC because he owns btc.com and because he takes bitcoin to promote this shit.
He is also speaking the the biggest BTC conference.
The moderators are doing the right thing... the will of the people.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:35:17
Then find a new partner or demand that CoinTelegraph stop promoting the scam.
@_date: 2015-05-02 21:38:54
Did you read the piece? It had some evidence in it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:20:57
I don't think so man.
Garza clearly has these sites in his back pocket and they are still posting on here like crazy all of the time. No one is calling them out. We need people doing that.
Obvious scam is obvious to us... but to the noobs who read these news sites it might not be so. If we keep visiting these sites we give them page views and promotions... more people who don't know this is a scam see those pumps.
We really need people to be aware of the role these news sites played.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:09:19
Really classy of your journalists to slam a reputable site after the things that have come out regarding CCN.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:04:04
This looks EPIX.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:11:32
After more CCN authors coming out to attack today... i am starting to think he did.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:31:25
Dude, not even remotely off topic. We should be demanding to know why these jerks at all of these "news sites" are promoting this shitcoin so hard.
Are you going to moderate all of the negative GAW stuff away?
People have a RIGHT to know which site he bought. The GAW posts are relevant to Bitcoin because he takes bitcoin to promote this scam further. It is extremely damaging and if people are going to upvote this stuff it should remain.
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:03:18
More defense from Bruce regarding GAW it seems.
We want this industry to be seen as legitimate. We need to cast light on the dark spots instead of just putting our head in the sand.
Wasn't it you and Moe that said we NEEDED Garza to still come to Miami so some light would be shed on things?
Now when it doesn't fit your narrative you want the light to no longer be cast?
Bruce, I am starting to think people like you are really hurting all of us and I really never thought I'd feel that way after meeting you in Austin last year and having dinner with you.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:11:56
Thanks for digging all of that up. I have mad respect for you and Coin Fire right now.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:11:00
Imagine that though, another CCN author who owns a coin and pumps it?
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:32:21
We don't know. He refuses to say which one and no one is demanding to know which one.
We the people need to demand an explanation from the sites. Stop upvoting and promoting the ones involved in this scam.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:26:46
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:36:44
I laughed.
This site is promoting the scam though.
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:09:08
Please refrain from posting sites that advertise the known scam Paycoin. Coin Telegraph has an advertisement network that is pushing Paycoin extremely hard across many sites.
You are literally contributing to the problem by submitting sites that promote it.
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:13:16
In case you need a reminder, please do not submit links to a site known for scamming and pumping scams: 
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:12:27
Let's hope that everyone get's on board and stops pumping CCN articles even when they are positive. Stop giving them the page views they desperately need to keep selling those paid articles.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:40:25
You are wrong.
This community needs to stand up against this shit.
Obvious scam is obvious.
@_date: 2015-01-07 00:04:00
This is to stop newbies from using that lie of a news site.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:27:39
It enables a scam.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:26:33
Whoa whoa whoa. The community has matured now and we are ready to stand up against these sort of scams with our coins and our words.
While it was acceptable to have BFL before the community hadn't reached a point where we would stand united against this stuff... we are now.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:26:44
Canceling it.
