Previously, it sounded as if you were saying there was some fundamental weakness of dependence on the dollar. Now you have narrowed that down to say that no one would accept bitcoin if they couldn't rapidly exit into the dollar. However, I put to you that if this quick exchange were not possible, then volatility would be likewise reduced, and people would still accept bitcoin. Bitcoin would be less attractive, but value would not, as you contend, evaporate.

1. Step 1: In Australia, buy the sum from a reputable dealer or multiple ones, or use CoinJar. Step 2: Now your money is in Bitcoin. Just use localbitcoins in the US to trade it back. The seller fee is only 1%.
2. Talk to a lawyer
3. Do this on a dip, not a rise. You can contact someone on localbitcoins in advance.

I think he's probably a human being who can make his own choices. If he can send $100,000 for only a $2,000 fee, he should probably do that, but I think the sum is less, and I think it's possible he can find what he's looking for on localbitcoins.
Actually, what I should have suggested is that he send part to Coinbase and do the rest through localbitcoins, but I'm not putting a gun to his head.

I was not addressing a complete absence of bitcoin to dollar exchange. If bitcoins were one of the only things in the economy you couldn't exchange for dollars, then I imagine it would have a pretty hard time. It could still exist, however, as I see you've stated, so there is no fundamental dependence on the dollar. Could you tell me the meaning of your username, HistoryLessonforBitc?

I agree. If nothing has changed since the last recession (it hasn't), and you look at the DJIA over [the past 30 years]( and you consider the coming recession, what's going to happen?
There won't be any trust in the dollar. Where will the money go? Possibly bitcoin.

A bitcoin is worth a boombox or a goat or seven hundred dollars. Bitcoin doesn't need fiat currency to exist. You can say bitcoin is priced in terms of dollars just as easily as you can say dollars are priced in terms of bitcoin. The euro can be priced in terms of dollars too, but that doesn't mean it's backed by dollars. The value of the dollar is meaningful to us, especially when the price of bitcoin fluctuates rapidly, but that doesn't mean bitcoin needs the dollar to have meaning. Value is attributed by people.
I once read someone say that Bitcoin is either going to $0 or thousands. It's hard to imagine it staying around where it is in terms of value.
As more assets flow into bitcoin, volatility will settle down, as fewer people will buy or sell at once. Volatility is certainly a factor in adoption. Do you expect the price to swing up and down forever?
The "community" could probably do a better job of having answers to objections ready for newcomers, but I'd say the community provides knowledge. I hope you can find all of the answers you're looking for here.

It's easy to see how Bitcoin could eventually make governments a thing of the past. Governments can't ask financial services providers about transactions when there is no financial intermediary between strangers. Governments' means of obtaining information in order to tax are greatly reduced by Bitcoin. People want to set rules for others much more than they want to set rules for themselves, so they are naturally disinclined to inform the state of their transactions. To bring it around, if enough people opt out, then governments are history. I think Bitcoin can be just as disruptive to taxes as 3D-printed guns can be to gun control. Eventually, gun control will be impossible. The state has allowed institutional money to flow into Bitcoin, and the market cap has a lot of room to grow before the state understands the currency well enough to create regulations that don't embarrass it. Bitcoin will probably cause massive changes in the ways we conduct financial transactions while preserving essential anonymous properties before any major shutdown occurs, so there are already signs of enhanced freedom in the near future. We also shouldn't forget that there will be competition between governments over Bitcoin liberty. The Federal Reserve has every reason to worry. The next time there is a dip in the market in the US, people won't be as kind to a big bank bailout, which means banks will have to steal from deposits as happened in Cyprus. Bitcoin doesn't use banks, so Bitcoin could promise us some form of insurance against that tyranny. Crypto-currencies hold the promise of continual flight from the state.

In the article, the developer suggests that the reasons Apple gave for rejection could threaten similar apps and says the rejection "strongly implies that any other encrypted group chat app can be rejected." I can't immediately see a reason for them to be making up their story.

That ISP's can throttle Bittorrent traffic is sufficient evidence, but here's [a Wired article]( about traffic shaping ISPs.

Just looking him up now, and I think that depends on perspective. He's been active, though that's not that surprising from someone who develops an encrypted chat app. He's also repeatedly (and unknowingly) resisted efforts from the FBI to entrap him.

I think it's a problem because a 10 or even 5 minute transaction time is unworkable for many merchants. Why do you act so aggrieved at staid criticism? That's not a constructive approach to solving problems.

Some people will divest their ideological consumer preference rectitude in favor of (what they consider) more agreeable possessions. The products are significant enough and differentiated enough that I think the paradox of voting applies.

Yes, and like eHow or wikihow, except, like you say, other people pay for articles instead of me. I suppose providing answers would be inherently risky. I would choose the sufficiently robust answers and require the person who made the request to accept one. The user could be encouraged to pay a micropayment to more than one good reply. I could post all of the replies after the transaction has taken place and rank them according to a user rating system.

ISP's can throttle BitTorrent traffic. If the government saw Bitcoin as too much of a threat to taxation, it could go to the ISP's.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:17:18
I can't believe my comments were taken as conjecture that p2p is ineffective. I'm saying that the government, through ISP's, can stop popular commercial bitcoin software from becoming a reality.

True, people will probably use whatever means are necessary. But I wonder if localbitcoins would be sufficient for it to take off in some countries. "Exchange your money for a different kind from some guy on the internet" doesn't quite come off as well as other money services. However, in Mexico for instance, Bitcoin is competitive with Western Union for remittance on localbitcoins in terms of fees. It's definitely faster to transmit and possibly even has fewer steps, so the only thing holding back remittance between the US and Mexico is that people don't know about Bitcoin. I imagine if at this stage, Bitcoin is the best choice there, then Bitcoin is probably competitive via localbitcoins everywhere.
