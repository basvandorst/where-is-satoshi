The majority of people don’t even know how money works. When I researched Bitcoin, I went down the rabbit hole. I learned about the a Federal Bank, debt cycle, fractional reserve lending, economic hitmen, etc...
Most people never learn about money because the system wants the sheep to stay blind. Sounds like a conspiracy and that’s how they want the sheep to react to it. 
That Kardashians are more interesting to the general public than Bitcoin, money, or stocks because quite frankly, most people just have no money.

Are you going to cite reddit? There are some good books on Bitcoin that are probably in your Library. Bitcoin has been around since 2008. I’d start there vs relying on Reddit.
I personally like: 
The Bitcoin Standard
The Internet Of Money
Get the Audiobooks on Audible and listen at 2x ��
Good luck!

Just don’t worry about it. Once your friend comes around, they can’t say “Why didn’t you tell me about Bitcoin earlier!?” 
Just be a real friend. Be humble and not rub it in.

I guess being an accredited investor isn't large enough.

Bought my 10yr old and 8yr old 1BTC each last year. My 8year old cares more about Robux. I said why do you want that? 
“So I can upgrade my character on Roblox or get him a cool outfit...” 
At least the next generation will have a better adoption of digital currency.

They need DNS-like addresses for wallets.

Don’t do it to BTC, just do it to the forks of Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin ATMs in the SF Bay Area need to scan a drivers license or ID.
