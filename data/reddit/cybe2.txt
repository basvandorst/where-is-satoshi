""Earlier; by a ruse; the outcome of the Battle of Waterloo had been falsified, Rothschild had spread a story that Napoleon had won that battle, which precipitated a terrific panic on the stock-market in England. All stocks had plummeted down to practically zero and Nathan Rothschild bought all the stocks for virtually a penny on its dollar values. That gave him complete control of the economy of Britain and virtually of all Europe. So, immediately after that Congress in Vienna had boomeranged; Rothschild had forced Britain to set up a new "Bank of England", over which he had absolute control, exactly, as later through Jacob Schiff; he engineered our own "Federal Reserve Act" which gave the House of Rothschild a secret control of the economy in the United States. But now for a moment; let's dwell on the activities of the Illuminati in the United States."
