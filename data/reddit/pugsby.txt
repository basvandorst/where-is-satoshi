Good suggestion. For whatever reason, I guess I was looking at starting with a single product and a dead-simple checkout for that product as a new website address specifically geared around bitcoin. But maybe I need to rethink and just add a BTC button instead of the normal payment button on my existing lineups.

Challenge accepted. I shall hopefully return within a few weeks to this subreddit with link in hand asking for yer BitCoins. I shouldn't dilly dally before someone beats me to it.

Currently, Paypal is just a necessary evil. We all have horror stories about them, but.... that's what everyone has right now or knows how to use already, so that isn't something I can discontinue entirely just yet. I hope to someday, however. I'd much rather deal with Bitcoin.

I'm still doing some research about that, specifically in the tax side of things, nothing else. That'd be the only reason I'd even have it. At this point, I'd agree with you. I've pretty much made my mind up not to collect it based on what I've seen.

Thanks for the responses. Helps a lot. 
On point 3... It might help if you knew what I am reselling currently... Check out:  We don't have control over their software releases, but they've been around for a long time and are pretty good at what they do. Our low-end product wouldn't have FTP/SFTP/etc, as it's just a client that's installed and configured and is more for convenience than security. We do have a higher-end Briefcase product which DOES have some of those features, but since I pay out of pocket for each of those accounts, it'd be considerably more expensive to sell and more inherently risky for me to sell. 
I guess it comes down to... do I want to offer ease of access at $30USD worth per year or more security and features and SFTP/DAV at $75USD worth per year. Sounds like you'd be in that second category.

Thanks. Yes, US based. Our existing company has been around almost 3 years. I'm not linking to it because, well, I don't want to give you people the idea that I'm just here to plug myself. 
The only reason I've asked address in the past is for tax related things. But that was more to be safe than a firm requirement. I'm really considering dropping that and only asking for an email address and optionally first and last name, at least for the Bitcoin side. I do respect people's privacy. We don't even have the ability to view people's files, and I never want to. 
But at the same time, as I mentioned to someone else, I am limited somewhat in what I can offer due to reselling someone else's software (for cheaper than anyone else can). But for the Bitcoin market, I will probably refer people to CloudFogger, which can give them another layer of protection just in case. 
These answers have helped me to feel better about this decision. I have yet to see a real downside to doing this.

Someday... someday it will be. Big hopes for Bitcoin bots across the web.

Fantastic feedback. If I had created the backend of the system I'm selling,   I think this is how I would pursue it as well. 
Sadly, however, the service requires certain inputs from us when we create new accounts... Email, name, subdomain, password.. I can really generate all of those, but email, which I use to re-bill people or send account information to from our billing system (WHMCS). 
A service starting from the ground up could operate that way, though. It's a good idea. In a perfect world... 
It looks like CoinBase may very soon support subscription/reoccuring billing. That's really putting them as the strongest option for me to use. I can do subscription billing from our client software, but it doesn't fully recognize Bitcoin's ways yet, so I really want to see what all CoinBase is rolling out.

Good thing, too. I ain't got that many. I do own a newish model Ford though, so if this had been available then... I would have done it in a heartbeat.
