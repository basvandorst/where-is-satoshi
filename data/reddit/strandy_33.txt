Bitcoin also made [The Front Page]( a couple weeks ago!

It was in StarNews. Have you been up to Duck &amp; Dive Pub and used BTC yet?

I'd expect a little more research into the topic from someone who understands Bitcoin. But yeah, I suppose I don't recommend it for you.

Did you happen to see NO. 3877835344 from last month?! It was so classy.
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:25:23
That's hilarious.

The real question here is "would you exhange all of your teeth 28(32) for 28(32) bitcoins?"
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:36:04
I would enjoy seeing this one. Find it, please!

it wasn't in the funnies section of the paper. No, I am not aware of any other places. I would gladly do business in bitcoin with any paddleboard related ventures, however. I should probably start promoting harder.

You must still have your wisdom teeth!

I just used my phones QR scanner on the actual copy of the newspaper and it was able to pick up the code. Apparently that small amount of his finger covering it doesn't make it unreadable.

And your capillary beds? Are they okay?
