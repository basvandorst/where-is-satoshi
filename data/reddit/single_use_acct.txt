Up, up and away. 
Everything is fine. Transactions need to be getting more expensive because reason (divorced from technical arguments).

Throughput is a big deal. Thinking otherwise is frankly idiotic and serves to prove you fail to understand the value proposition of bitcoin.

Hi Gregory!

If throughput is actually fixed then bitcoin dies.

If you want bitcoin to become a universal payment ledger for the internet then you have a lot more learning to do..

Most secured, yet limited in transactional usefulness by being constrained to 1mb blocks because Gregory Maxwell says that's enough for the entire world. 
Never mind that other blockchains long ago solved this problem with trivial flexible cap solutions. Heck Satoshi suggested a simple fix in 2010 when blocks were 5kb in size and the max_blocksize was placed far away at 1mb, a theoretical upper bound, until now of course.

What business is it of yours how much value I choose to move with a transaction carrying an appropriate fee?
@_date: 2016-03-28 10:31:39
At some stage you will realise the epic logical fail you persist in making. 
It doesn't matter when it occurs, it is enough to understand that it *will* occur if transaction levels rise further using logic and reason. 
You are on the decks of the titanic after the iceberg has been belatedly sighted, the great ship will strike at any moment, and you are telling everyone it's fine because the first people to notice said we should have hit it 5 minutes ago.
Stupidity is hard to counter when it cannot reason.

False argument. 
6 cents if your transaction is confirmed. Or you wait in limbo for hours or days because what worked an hour ago now doesn't - magical guessing wallet software or not. 
This may be spam 'attacks' but it proves how ridiculously fragile the system is. When there is no spare capacity it costs fuck all to push up transaction fees and prevent legitimate transactions from confirming in a reasonable time or perhaps at all. In terms of users experience this couldn't be worse for bitcoin. 
The fact we are even having this argument is astounding. Nicely played Gregory Maxwell!

Content-free appeals like that deserve zero respect.

The main flaw with your extremely flawed statement is that a bitcoin with a fixed upper bounded blocksize has a limited capacity for users to transact across the network. 
The issue, indeed the fundamental issue is that once this limit is reached, demand for the network for the first time since inception will not be met by transactional supply.
Anyone who cannot see economic consequences of this being highly detrimental to bitcoin growth and the maintenance of speculative value going forward are either dim or stand to benefit from the situation.
@_date: 2016-03-31 19:10:06
Core dev's don't get to decide shit. They can't even get the network to run the latest release.

That isn't how economics or markets work. 
If people cannot use bitcoin without either paying exorbitant fees or being sure the network will confirm their normal use transaction then they will move elsewhere. That migration of users will collapse the speculative value of bitcoin.
I wonder sometimes that a lot of the frequent posters and known names in the bitcoin scene do not seem to understand trivial economic concepts that anyone with a pinch of common sense or life experience unconsciously understands implicitly.

Short sighted kid.

I can see you are a true bitcoin fan. I am the same.
However, your thinking is flawed because unlike the gold standard there are hundreds of other chains which may be technologically superior (or inferior) of which one could simply soak up speculative value from bitcoin through increased demand in the face of an ossified congested bitcoin.
Mark my words, if bitcoin becomes unusable for day to day transactions because confirmations become unreliable or transaction fees become more than a few cents, then everyone will move on to another blockchain not encumbered by a governance crisis. 
What use is bitcoin being a gold standard with payment layers galore if no one chooses to give it value or uses it? I have several hundred btc and I use btc for buying things from time to time (most commonly takeaways recently) and as a store of value. But the store of value component is based upon future speculative value of many more people using it as a speculative store of value and a payment network. All the VC funding has entered the bitcoin space and supported bitcoin companies for that reason also - the expectation of future growth. 
If it becomes clear that bitcoin will not achieve the basic goal of keeping ahead of transactional demand for new users (forgetting the Fidelity Effect) then there will be a concerted move to another blockchain.
I invested originally in bitcoin because it was the truest most perfect form of money in the world. It cannot infinitely scale. But it can keep ahead of transactional demand for at least the next 5 years. Preventing this from happening is the same thing as sabotaging the project.
The market will find a solution. My bitcoins may become worthless in the process but my 10% hedge into other chains may keep me afloat in this great experiment. I would far rather have not been forced to gamble in the altcoin market at all. I suspect there are hundreds if not thousands of others like me who can see the writing on the wall for the first time after years of being die hard believers.

This guys works for the FED and you are lapping up his words as it supports your "bitcoin is gold 2.0" fantasy. 
Good practice with central bankers is ignore what they *say* and instead watch what they actually *do*. If you think central banks will welcome bitcoin ever then you are naive in the extreme.

Funny. It seems to me that the only time the voting system is changed to 'controversial-suggested' is when the top comment is pro-big block or anti-theymos.

Lots actually. But some of us don't crave attention, we just care about bitcoin.
