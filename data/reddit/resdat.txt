I think either format is fine. Also, you may try sending payments as well as receive them. The way I received them was to set up eclair on my phone and send some BTC to my Eclair windows system. Not sure if this helps or not, but I figure some transactions may help the visibility and to confirm it is not the network.

Yes, the centralized hubs currently are things like blockstream (SLEEPYARK) and Yalls. These are the few sites that are selling anything om mainnet at this time, so that is why people are connecting to them to do a simple test.
