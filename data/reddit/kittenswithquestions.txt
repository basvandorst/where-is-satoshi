Well, the connection I thought of was that with the addition of bitcoin, this joke won't quite work anymore. Part of the reason bitcoin is so great is because it's a worldwide cryptocurrency and it doesn't need to go through third-party processors like banks.

And that's why we need to spread the word! I live in a pretty small town in California, U.S., and almost no one in real life here knows enough about Bitcoin to realize what a great investment it is to accept it. If they started accepting it as payment, it would bring a lot of business to them from people who are into it--like you and I. I think there are even places willing to do the conversion for you automatically if you're a business accepting bitcoin; as in, the customer pays in bitcoin, it's converted to dollars before it reaches you. So the business doesn't even have to be into bitcoin yet or fully understand why it's okay to be used as a currency despite the price still being volatile. Whenever my mom does a business transaction in real life, she asks them if they accept bitcoin, and makes the pitch to them about why they should when they say (inevitably, at this point) that they do not and don't really know about it.

Um, you know how you can lose money? Get too scared to do the smart thing and convert to bitcoins while the price is LOW, and only take them out (if at all) when it's HIGH. Don't do the opposite of that.
It's not really an "investment" so much as a new currency that's still at an early stage. Sure, the price is still volatile, but it's also at the cusp of becoming mainstream (more than it is now). It's still at the point where many people who aren't tech-savvy are unaware or uneducated about bitcoin.
Obviously no one will invest more than they can afford, but frankly, I think you're more likely to lose (potential) money by NOT investing than the reverse.
