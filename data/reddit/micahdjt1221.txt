You sound like a major douche. Hope you can buy friends with that Bitcoin Cash too.

I mean the opposite could happen too, which would be far more hilarious. In either case, it would be nice if our lord and savior could return and help settle some of these arguments.

That's what's bothered me far more than the big block small block debate. Talking about scaling is great, but the reason WHY we are scaling up is the real topic.
You don't have to be an anarchist to support BTC, but you should realize that this community and currency was built by anarchists and libertarians. This is a tool to wield against overbearing governments. That ethos should be respected.

You need to start saving the word "attack" for when the CIA seizes 51% of miners. A Bitcoin fork you disagree with, or an altcoin with the same algo, is not an attack. Bitcoin Cash is also called (and referred to by all media) as such, so the linguistic nonsense is a bit ridiculous.

This is not a democracy. The market will decide which coin is best, and individuals are free to vote with their money.

CNN is Very Fake News. To the moon!

That's not true; fees have been similar for quite sometime and you have no evidence that it's spam. Just the cost of decentralization, which makes Bitcoin strong.
A good scaling solution is strong enough to handle "spam"/paying users anyhow.

Nice copypaste from WallStreetBets, though that does sound like a good strategy for trading BTC.

1) Tether has lots of features upcoming
2) Poloniex trusts Tether
3) FUD
4) So Tether is fine
I'm not sure who's correct here, but Bitfinexed presents a lot more evidence in his arguments than you do OP. 
The fact is: Tether is acting like fiat money while being unbacked by actual USD, and that's fraudulent. Many of his attacks on BitFinex (the hack, their stealing from their own customers, the joke lawsuit against Wells Fargo) are objectively true. The CEO of BitFinex openly admitted to using shell companies to bank for Bitfinex. And the crypto that they stole appreciated in value before they returned the USD value, so no, they didn't return it properly. 
Bitcoin will be better with transparent, credible, solvent exchanges (unlike Bitfinex and Gox) that aren't practicing the type of fractional-reserve fraud that's so pervasive in fiat.

Why would someone buy something for above-market price? This is not how betting works. 
A better question: Would you bet $5,000 of Bitcoin that Bitcoin Cash will be  on CoinMarketCap in a year (or above BTC Core)? 
He did donate $1 million Bitcoin to a free market non-profit after having a slightly incorrect prediction on the price of BTC, so he might be up for it.

I don't see how altcoin is even subjective. The market will decide which fork is an altcoin. If core/segwit/small blocks are popular, they will be Bitcoin with 90%+ market cap. If the big blocks attain a higher market cap, they will be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:01:05
There's no need to hate on people that devoted themselves to helping to build Bitcoin back when nobody was using it (the coders are just one part of that, along with users, miners, business owners, investors). He can use Bitcoin Cash, you can use Bitcoin Core. If crypto is stronger we all are, and multiple approaches decentralize the process after all. The way this subreddit shifted from optimistically taking over the world and fighting intrusive governments to fighting those with different scaling preferences is very upsetting to say the least.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:49:26
The market will decide that. It very well could be an altcoin, which in any case will be supported because these exchanges love crypto tokens of any value. Bitcoin is not decided by any developer, subreddit, etc, but by a clearly superior market cap.

I don't use Coinbase because I watched the "Rise and Rise" of Bitcoin where Ehrsham, a former entry-level Goldman Sachs staffer, explains "he doesn't agree with Bitcoin politically". Well I don't agree with Coinbase politically going above and beyond to cozy up to the US government and sell out its users.

Roger is an extremely devoted anarchist and clearly wants Bitcoin to succeed. He just differs in opinion with you, and it's certainly possible to advocate for different objectives without being a computer scientist. I studied economics under Milton Friedman's protege; I'm not going to be told I can't have an opinion about the economic implications of two distinct directions. 
Economists and economically-literate people think marginally: for each 1MB of additional space, how much decentralization are we abandoning? With current advancements in $100 node capacity, some of us think the tradeoff at 2MB-8MB is a good one to make. Some don't. Nobody is opposed to decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:57:50
This subreddit would be nicer to read if people just didn't use coinbase. You don't have to use the most regulated exchange in the world, run by guys like Ehrsham who "don't agree with Bitcoin politically". No better than a generic bank.

These attitudes affirm that this split will be mutually beneficial.

There's going to be a "settlement layer" Bitcoin and an "electronic cash" Bitcoin. I don't see this as another altcoin or as an issue, since it resolves scaling debate. Two very different interpretations of Satoshi's whitepaper get two different forks of Bitcoin (specifically segwit2x). Whichever has a higher market cap in a year will be "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:07:53
I submit we refer to both forks as Bitcoin since they're two interpretations of the White Paper. See how the market caps look in a year, and maybe do a name change then. Smaller mkt cap could go to Bcash or Bcore.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:59:48
Would 2MB segwit2x require a mega data center? That all or nothing thinking runs contrary to core economics. "Rational people think at the margin". Decentralization is critical, but the tradeoff is not quite as you describe.

John McAfee is also insane. 
...though I kinda like him. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:06:34
You post this to a subreddit that bans people who disagree with segwit or have differing views on the scaling debate in general. I don't see what point you expect to make...but hopefully the upcoming forks will allow you what you want, and the economic majority what we want.
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:01:12
Since it's so easy to do, my guess is you're just trying to (not so) subtly make a political statement. It's not hard to just deposit into BitFinex and get credited immediately.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:53:15
Tolerating differing opinions does not mean allowing trolls. I've seen plenty of core supporters on btc, and all have been pretty polite and none have been banned.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:50:33
If you reduce a position at highs and increase at lows like now, you would have more Bitcoin than you do now.
