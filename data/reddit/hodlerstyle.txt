The only real shitcoin is the USD.

If what you bought is genuine Lefkara lace, then it may be pretty priceless. Production of those laces i almost stopped, and their prices keep going up. Sadly the era of Lefkara lace making is closing to an end, but gladly not for the jewellery. 
Thank you for visiting our village, and hopefully you will visit us again one day! Thanks for your wishes :)

I understand with your notion, and partly I agree, but please bear in mind that for people with a business background like me, developing the implementation from scratch is impossible. Merchants like us need ready-made solutions/APIs provided by trustworthy companies because this the only easy to implement and safe solution in the market now. That guarantees the safety of our services.
Ideally credible open-source API merchant solutions will become available, and the exchange rates will be set by decentralized exchanges, but until this day comes, we have to settle with the next best option.
Not everything in life is Black or White. Small steps need to be made until we reach to Satoshis dream, and it is a dream that I believe in too.

Will look into this, thanks for the heads up!

Everything you see is our products, and all media is also our production (videos/images) that I personally captured and edited with my friends and family. Also check our shipping policy on our site:
There is NO drop-shipper in this world who can give you delivery of goods within 1-2 days nationwide as we do, and within 7 days (for express) worldwide as we do. You know why? Because it's our product. End of story.

We all originated from a Vegana so I don't mind :))) If you look in the gallery, you will find some Bobs too :P

Lol, bro I am doing 3 jobs that most people would do 1 as a full time, so the question here is how much time one had at hand, and if the change brings some significant value or not.
BTCpay has no integration with Shopify and I'm not a website developer so there's no need to go for the extra trouble. Regarding the fees I stated before, I was wrong. 
I had contacted Coinbase to made sure for it: Coinbase does not charge extra fees, the consumer pays only the pay network transaction fees, so I guess that's good enough.

it's hard to tell with 100% certainty by just looking at it, but if the colours, texture, threads and patterns look similar to the ones in this video, then it's probably genuine:

Hello, I'll think about it. I had some people asking me to keep it because they use it though, so haven't made my mind
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:10:53
Very kind of you, thank you

Bro, look at my reddit username! of course I will HODL!! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:10:57
Thank you for your support :) many will laugh at us, mock us, or intimidate us. But we shall see who laughs best in the end

I am not sure which payment provider your hostel is using, so can't comment on that. In our case Coinbase commerce has no official documentation for the fees, but to my experience it is around 3-5% which close to what a credit card company will charge you.
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:38:24
No, but sounds very interesting! Will look into it, sounds as a great match for us!
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:34:21
I can tell you by pm if you want..
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:08:54
haha, i think i'll skip that :P
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:46:44
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:00:31
Thank you for your kind comments! Day by day we are getting closer to that. As adoption becomes widespread it crypto will inevitably be used in our everyday purchases.
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:59:05
9-5 too boring for us  ;)
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:02:43
Perfect! Thanks for the heads up, will apply right now!
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:59:02
Hahahahaha now this makes everything more interesting :D
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:29:20
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:30:16
Haha no worries! I've been in the internet long enough so I'm used to them!
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:26:33
Thank you! We hope so but even if we don't we will still know that we supported something innovating :)
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:59:02
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:51:08
There are cheap copies for every single jewellery on this world. End quality is what makes a great difference. So yes, I know there are cheaper shops than us, and honestly that never hurt our business that my family is doing for 30 years now. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:48:41
sounds pretty cool! hmmmmm ;)
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:51:34
Yes, we do!
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:32:38
I understand your pain. It took us 2 months to finally get a provider for credit card payments!! and not to mention the huge costs! ($100 setup ,  + $10 month + 2-3% fees + $25 chargebacks... nightmare. Crypto is a much better option
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:05:07
You sir are really among the innovators :) Thanks for the information shared
@_date: 2018-07-26 11:01:34
Draper can be spot on with this forecast or even pessimistic! It's all or nothing but if we assume BTC is here to stay (the most likely scenario ) by 2022 it should be well established in means of payments as much as credit cards are today. That means that a $250K+ BTC on a crypto market of $10+ Trillion isn't that a science fiction as it used to sound
@_date: 2018-04-14 15:58:03
A bit too early to celebrate but this course is inevitable. History repeats it self, BTC can and will reach All time highs!
