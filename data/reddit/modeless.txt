That would be like operating an exchange where customer deposits are kept under each customer's own mattress. Without control of the funds Bitfinex would not be able to guarantee trade execution. How could any financial institution operate that way? No, the CFTC essentially required what Bitfinex did and regulation shares blame here.

You're right. The clock started when the notice was published in the Federal Register July 14th:

This is awesome! U2F is even *more* secure than normal 2-factor because it can't be phished. That's right, even if an evil site tricks you into entering your password *and* pressing the button on your U2F device, they still can't steal your login. Google requires its employees to use it for that reason. Now we just need Bitcoin exchanges to implement support.

The article is wrong, isn't it? The whole point of getting SEC approval for an ETF is so regular people can buy it. Accredited investors can already buy the Bitcoin Investment Trust without SEC approval (at the real price, not the strangely inflated GBTC price).

Scalability and speed. I want it to be feasible to, for example, run a wi-fi access point and charge per byte with settlement every few seconds at most. And I don't want to have to set up "channels" or whatever ahead of time. I want everyone to be able to pay anyone else with no setup and instant settlement, just like how anyone can send an IP packet anywhere on the internet instantly without setup. 
And I want the blockchain to become pruneable and appropriate incentives or fixes added to restrict UTXO growth so that the data required to start and run a full node doesn't keep growing forever with no upper bound.

Hey, I'm a big fan of Coinbase and I agree that the post is hyperbolic. However, this comment is tone deaf. Mixing apologies with criticism sounds insincere.
Surely you know that dealing with unresponsive customer support and buggy software can be infuriating. Also remember that $12,000 is a huge amount of money to some people who aren't startup founders, and losing access to it for several days with no ETA can feel threatening. You should let your employees handle this one.

Bitcoin benefits for consumers are: you don't need to give any personal information like name or address or phone number to send money, payment information can't be re-used by the merchant to charge you multiple times, merchant security breaches can't drain money from your account, there's no interest or late payment charges or  overdraft fees, and you can pay people without merchant accounts such as friends/family or Wikileaks etc.
Benefits for merchants are: no chargeback fraud, no restrictions on size or frequency of payments, no percentage fees, no restrictions on the kinds of products or services that can be sold or who they can be sold to, and in general no need to get permission from anybody.
Of course, there are downsides too, and you shouldn't pretend that these don't exist.
For consumers: poor computer security can easily result in your entire balance being stolen with no recourse, few merchants accept it, making payments often involves QR codes, refunds don't always work, exchanges can be slow and unreliable and charge fees, value may be volatile, transactions are posted publicly on the blockchain which may reveal more information than you would like about your wealth/income/purchases, and there's no built-in purchase protection from unscrupulous merchants.
For merchants: few consumers have it, software for sending and accepting payments is immature, no support for recurring subscription payments or automatic payments (for an Uber or App Store scenario), there may be unresolved legal questions in some jurisdictions, and confirmation times are too long for instant purchases.

Arguments in favor:
* "Bit" is associated with technology.
* "Bit" is appropriate for something small.
* "Bit" is a part of the word "Bitcoin", and a logical choice for a short form of the word.
* "Bit" is one syllable (unlike "satoshi" or "millibit").
Rebuttals of arguments against:


"Bit" as a currency unit is a historical curiosity and most people couldn't tell you how much it was even if they've heard of it. Furthermore, "dollar" represents no less than 23 currency units in active use today and many more unofficial and historical ones [1].


"Pound" is a unit of force, "cent" is a unit of frequency intervals [2], "franc" is a homophone for a common name, "yen" is an English word for "longing or yearning", "dong" is a slang vulgarity. Words have multiple meanings and people deal with it every day.

Seems pretty clear to me. An early adopter decided $300 is their breaking point. They want to cash out their $9m before they miss their chance. They're not experienced with handling this amount of money because they've never been rich before; they just got lucky. They don't have the connections to sell off-market so they decided to sell the way they know and the way that's guaranteed to work: a Bitstamp sell order below market. They could maybe get more money with a more sophisticated trading strategy but who cares? They'll take their $9m and retire on a beach somewhere for the rest of their lives.
That's what I'd do if I had 30,000 BTC right now and I bet you would too.

Ever notice that GBTC is 10-30% more expensive than actual bitcoin? The reason is the supply of GBTC is limited because of the roundabout way it was created. The supply of COIN is limited only by the 21 million coin ceiling. If there's demand for non-SEC-approved GBTC at a 30% premium, imagine the demand for SEC-approved COIN at a 0% premium. Also, the mere fact that the SEC approved a Bitcoin fund would probably be front-page news in a bunch of financial publications, and we all know what media attention does to the price.

I disagree because it *is* helpful. OP asked how to turn bitcoins into dollars and Buttercoin is one of the best ways to do that. This short question doesn't need a long-winded reply; a link is perfectly appropriate; there are plenty of instructions at the link. If the link was off-topic or to a bad site then you'd be right, but Buttercoin is perfectly appropriate here. And because it's appropriate, there's nothing wrong with putting a referral code on it. The referral code doesn't make it inappropriate by itself, and there's no obligation to call out the referral code specifically. It's not even hidden or anything.

If you look at the top 20, most of them are not real articles but special pages and/or glitches in the statistics. Bitcoin's rank among actual articles about real topics is probably more like 60 or so.

I think your misunderstanding is in the way ETFs work. COIN is not a pile of a fixed number of BTC. Shares can be created and redeemed at any time by adding or withdrawing BTC. There is no upper limit to the number of BTC that COIN can hold.
The process of creating and redeeming shares is complex, but the net effect is that when lots of people buy COIN, actual BTC get bought at the exchanges we all use, and are deposited in COIN's cold storage. Therefore people buying COIN can affect the real price at Bitcoin exchanges.

You should not connect a Windows XP system to the internet. You should make an offline backup of the wallet. If you have a lot of coins make a second backup and store it somewhere outside your house. As long as you have backups then the coins are stored safely and there's no need to do anything else until you want to move them. At that point, rather than connecting your laptop to the internet I recommend restoring the wallet backup on a newer system with an up-to-date OS (possibly Android or iOS which are less likely to have malware than a Windows PC, unless they are rooted). Then you can immediately transfer the coins to wherever.

BTW, it's also weird seeing USD prices with 3 decimal places. I'd prefer having USD always rounded to at most 2 decimal places. Right now I've switched the "price precision" to 3, but if the price goes above 10 then that will round to 1 decimal place which isn't what I want either.
