To be fair, the mempool has been empty atleast once every 24 hours for weeks now.
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:20:47
The block was eventually mined by the same miner tho.
@_date: 2019-07-28 22:56:57
Back up. This did not age well.
@_date: 2019-10-02 17:49:44
I don't get this, can you explain?
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:03:14
This is such a stupid, stupid argument. Literally everyone can afford bitcoin, a satoshi is still less than a cent.
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:51:04
No, it's Russian oligarchs parking their money in assets that cannot be frozen. This, by the way, was a huge factor for the $20k run in 2017.

"Oktober" and general syntax suggests the guy is German.
@_date: 2019-06-09 22:40:39
Why double the block size now? Most days you can send with &lt;10 sat/b and get confirmed within the next block. It's completely unnecessary right now.
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:49:15
No one is interested in http if the internet is removed from the equation.
This is how stupid your argument is.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:27:17
If what bitcoin does, others will follow is true.. why not buy bitcoin?
Additionally, all the other coins are down in comparison to BTC lately.
And lastly, eventually we will see a dotcom event where all the altcoins go into apocalypse-mode. It's not if, it's when.
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:10:47
Are you old enough to remember the dotcom bubble burst? Quick history lesson:
Back then, google, ebay etc. were starting to turn profitable on a scale that was unimaginable (as in: global) before that point and their stocks absolutely **exploded** as a result of that. 
Consequently, a lot of "companies" took the opportunity to get incredible, made up estimations to make a lot of money with non-competitive or straight up scammy businesses. The rest [is history](
Obviously you can do with your money whatever you want and I'm not strictly BTC-only. But please consider that the changes are high that many of the alt coins you're buying are  Pets.com, Webvan, and Boo.com, the Worldcom, NorthPoint Communications and Global Crossing of the crypto bubble.
Many, many people were estatic about their "alt web companies" quadrupling their money - and eventually lost their winnings and then some in the crash.
It **will** come.

Dude who posts in Israel, Iran, (American) news which is overrun by rightwing bots and exmuslim posts a proven fake picture with political agenda.
Come on man, fuck off!

[This]( was during the pump yesterday (rightmost column), and [this]( is right now. Unless you're amazing at picking the right troll coins (GRIN?! Anyone?), you'd be better off with BTC.
Litecoin is an exception because their halving is coming up soon(er than BTC).
Your alts may have doubled and tripled. What I'm saying is that unless you picked extremely well by dumb luck, BTC only would have yielded better results.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:08:09
Bitcoin will not go down 90% within 6 months. There is a price bottom both because of already done proof-of-work (blockchain) and because of miner profitability.
That being said, over 50% of surveyed businesses and &gt;70% of Asian businesses consider the blockchain technology to be the or one of the most important in recent times. There is also value in that.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy, both with regards to fungibility and usability. Your arguments could have been made against the 90's internet, and see where that went.
In short: Superior technology will, in the longterm, **always** prevail on way or the other.
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:33:37
The shittiest of shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-06-09 22:11:12
Where will the bitcoin go when people do not claim them by the end of today? Seems shady AF.
@_date: 2019-04-18 17:25:53
You always only had to add 10k satoshis if you passed the torch, that's like 52 cents right now.

I've seen your reddit karma stat profile and I do not believe that you don't hold BCH.
**Anyways, new tech takes time. If crypto takes another 10 years to reach mass adoptation, so be it.**
Plus, high fees are not necessarily a bad thing, it's a defense mechanism against third parties using the block chains for their own confirmations, which has been happening a lot before. No matter how large you make a block, it will just be exploited for off-site-confirmations if fees are not a consideration.
Bitcoin is, as of now, still the most elegant solution and will therefore prevail in the longterm.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:37:31
The lightning network currently takes 1 sat~~/b~~ fee and takes roughly 9 seconds to complete a transaction.
Is this too slow or expensive for you? The guy who paid $60 in fees is a moron, defragment your wallet and use [this site]( to find the most efficient sat/b fee range for your needs.
@_date: 2019-04-28 14:03:01
Yes sorry, I'll correct it. Hadn't hat my coffee yet when I wrote it.
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:43:40
It is not that easy to get physical dollars in Venezuela right now (because everyone who has some is HODLing them). Bitcoin on the other hand is easy(ier) to acquire and trade.

Cool, so you take no responsibility when you do something nefarious with these keys?
@_date: 2019-04-30 15:25:24
Spreading out liabilities. Very common.
@_date: 2019-04-30 08:36:16
"Paste your private key here"!? Um, how about no?
My scam alarm bells are ringing!
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:56:30
How many MB is it away from the mempool tip? One block is usually a little over 1MB and takes roughly 10 minutes.
[Here]( you can see when the last blocks were mined.
And [here]( you can see which fees are currently congested and choose one that is empty so you get faster results.
@_date: 2019-04-18 17:24:32
Reigniting is probably just sending a new transaction with the old amount to someone.
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:46:51
Just means people don't understand basic concepts, wouldn't read too much into it.
@_date: 2019-04-14 13:05:13
I've asked myself the same thing and did some digging. Integration for the layman is currently in development and will look slightly different than the "normal" send/receive sections right now. Watchtower services will be provided within the software.
There was no timeline given, but it's apparently high on the priorities list.
[Some info in this interview](
@_date: 2019-04-28 13:03:00
Because it's still in active development, it's less than two years old.
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:42:11
In other talks he said that it's possible that there will be both public, free watchtowers and private watchtowers that will take a monthly fee.
Apparently, this still is (or was at the time of the talk) a topic of discussion amongst developers.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:20:00
ETH for example is already like what, 2TB in size? And some blocks are actually lost, no one has any records of them. This problem is only gonna become more prevalent as time goes on, especially if usage is increasing in a hyperbolic way for a while.
Small blocksizes and working on decreasing tx size is just the more elegant solution and will therefore prevail in the longterm, especially with LN as an off-chain solution to support it.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:44:43
You do know at any time what the transaction cost is, and you can choose it yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:59:25
You don't have to do any of that. You **can**.

Get her demands in writing, then sue the shit out of her afterwards. Fucking bitch.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:04:00
Man, lot of BCash brigarding going on here.
LN is the answer, it is a very new tech that needs some time. So what.
Until that happens, you either pay the on-chain fee if you need the money within 10 minutes (who really does though). I've paid 11 sat/b yesterday and waited for 18 hours, paid like 20 cents in fees.
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:52:01
It is not deflationary, it just has a fixed, decreasing inflation. Please stop spreading this misinformation. 
Additionally, increased value over time is only inevitable if demand is a constant!
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:57:30
Meh, I'm certain a lot of Russian oligarchy money went straight into bitcoin when the sanctions first were announced. And the Russians are in a lot of war zones lately. I don't think this assessment is entirely accurate.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:58:46
28 coins are roughly $170k right now. Worth fighting over, especially when the side effect is showing this gold digger a lesson.
@_date: 2019-05-19 00:00:38
None of these articles support your claim.
