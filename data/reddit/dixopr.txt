The problem with bitcoin acceptance fornthe general audience is they don't imagine the mechasim of a distributed economy without middlemen.  Although still so very early, I hope that some economic plateforms start taking center stage that allow P2P economic development.

People are missing the point.  Pooled loans will be the mechanism for growth.  I wouldnt lend 50k to one person if I only have 100k.  But i would lend 10k to 10k people, part of a pool of 100M people, with an avg return of 5 percent.  Now think if thelian pool was backed by asset security, like home loans the risk is further reduced.

How about Liquid Crypto
@_date: 2018-10-31 22:50:43
It's just colder version of America but without Americans 
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:49:26
Gold does have the same ability but is not as easily traded outside local domains.  
I think we are on the same page but perhaps I believe bitcoin to be more easily liquidated.

Best part was it was borderless.  Could have transfered 300M worth of wealth from one nation to another, or one individual to another or one company to many.  Who knows.

I think what everyone needs to ask themselves is "do you see value in bitcoins ability to improve global commerce? Does it have an economic incentive?  Can it facility a transfer of wealth?  If so then it has a future.  Done.  Move on.

Massive currency inflation deflates your personal wealth unless you are uber rich.  Bitcoin offers a global wealth system that hedges against a fiats inflation.  Conversely if a global currency like usd hyper inflates so with the value of bitcoin.

Its Soros!  ;-) 
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:29:32
I don't believe this is true.  Wages do not rise proportionally to inflation.  Even now, we are witnessing the erosion of the middle class.  A sudden or gradual hyper inflationary period would reduce personal wealth even further.
My point was not related to rich getting richer or poor suffering, all economic drivers deliver this result.  However, as a hedge Bitcoin is multi national and is not based on political or military insecurity.  It offers an ability to diversify that was not possible before, I see this as it's true value.

What is this garbage?  I hate this type of fluff.  Not a critic yo OP.   But the garbage that is written daily.  Nobody knows the future.  Look at peak oil, then shale gas came along and bottomed the industry.  You never know what could happen.

Yes.  Totally correct.  But we have other technologies that can ensure people are people and can be identified.  The blockchain doesn't solve all issues, but I believe it to be a better ledger than a state run or private ledger.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:35:08
One of the most practical uses of blockchain going.  Transparency, trust, ability to audit, near free and thus allowing more voting to take place on may issues.  The list goes on.  I very much believe that we could reshape our ideas of democracy through blockchain.  A voted in representative is infinitely more corruptable than the populous at large.  Dumb the person and vote the issues.

Good work
@_date: 2018-07-10 18:57:59
Im happy for you and agree with you on many levels.  But have a positive outlook on the future, hopeing for my kids.  I guess my financial input is supportive of the decentralization of finance.  I hope for a blockchain democracy to give voting and democracy more accountability.  I also believe that the currency tracking via blockchain is a potential Orwellian future, but I hope that "we the people" can evolve beyond that.  I absolutely hate the way politicians, once elected have almost zero accountability.  Campaigns promise change asnew issues pop up and the voters have no voice.  I'm hopeing for a democratic system that is continually updated and supports the beat teams to work on issues.  I believe blockchain voting and democracy can empower this.  So I guess it's not bitcoin specifically that I support.  But the potential for change.  
Anyway.  Good day!  I appreciate the polite and respectful conversation.

Why do you need 45 dollars in btc?  why not ask for 45 dollars?  Hard to understand why if in three days you'll have 3k, wouldn't a friend give you a little cash to hold you over.  What would btc do for you?

Cool, I found total elimination without treats took away any desire for carbs or sugars.  So much so that I had 24 hour periods I didn't eat because I didn't think about it.  Nice to free yourself from thinking about food.  - Now just need to stop thinking about money!

Interesting, even daily stock or bond checks is too much.  You do anything else compulsively?  250 times a day seems extreme but I'm lazy.  I check like 3 times a day unless sometging exciting is going on.  But even then I don't know why I check at all.

And using that power to increase the wealth of the 1%, destabalize the country into possible civil war, provoke "partners and allies" abandoning trade, all while flag waving saying your the greatest.  I hope bitcoin f Usd in the end.

And how many gold transactions have economic value?  What about transferring wealth between national borders?  Nobody knows if bitcoin transactions are, those have economic value.

Why don't you ever see real bitcoin experts on CNN?  or any mass media organizations?I don't watch them much but see the posts here.   Listen to the contributors that actually program and add value.  They understand it.  These guys and the news organizations have their own motivations.  Bitcoin evolves, slowly but progress happens, the network grows, users grow.  Coin doesn't.  So the only thing quantifiable is their will only be 21 million.

Figure that investment firms will use it as a hedge and store of value in the mid and long term that will increase its price over time.  South Korea banks hedging is the start of global store of value.  When SEC licence an Etf crypto will bloom.  Look at ROBO and BOTZ etf.  Was a bandwagon Etf in 2017.  Same will happen to a crypto Etf.

This is my blockchain worry.  I coin tracking system linked to me and all that I do.  My phone tracks me and listens to my conversations.

Nothing wrong with satoshis.  The currency of the future.  Lighting network, when fully developed will allow for micro payments that will be the economy of tge future.  Even if a satoshi is worth a penny, still better than a penny, at least you'll be able to send it around the world.

Do you have cash in hand?  Or is it all tied up in banks and market?  Has your cash in hand maintained its buying power or has it suffered against inflation and quantitative easing to devalue debt.  Has your debt been devalued like national debt or has it maintained its hold over you?  Think about your hedge against devaluation, real estate has been a traditional store of value and has increased against inflation but does it have the same appeal now?  In some markets yes, urban centres are getting priced out of reach of most people.  
I think most people are negative towards bitcoin because the conversation is largely binary.  Bitcoin or fiat. Decentralization or central control.  Government and corporations vs it's citizens and customers.  The truth is both will exist.  Does crypto have a value I terms of efficiency, can it add value to the real world?  My belief is yes.  Will we need government in the near term, yes.  Will people continue to use banks? Yes.  But can these entities innovate their processes to add real world value using blockchain?  Yes.  Will we evolve to a more representative government and world?  Remains to be seen.  Our world is dominated by corporate greed and cronie politics.  We have a global economy but regional governments.  The two systems don't provide equality.  Corporations use this to their advantage, making use of environmental legislation and human resource cost differentials to maximize profits.  We demonize this practise but choose cheap goods in place of supporting our neighbours.  But then vilify them on the political front.  So either we evolve our world politics or we will all suffer.
