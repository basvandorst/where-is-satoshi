you say this with an air of someone who has attempted to do precisely that, repeatedly.

meh, seems to me gox price was becoming irrelevant months before that, it was always the highest and nobody would trade you coin at the gox price if you bought/sold them face to face, at least no one that knew what they were doing..

But the prince needs your help! hes stuck in a foreign country!

I cant help but shake the feeling that if karpeles lived in say..europe or the US someone would have jumped the fucker by now, maybe done some rubber-hose cryptography...
Those damn japanese! Being all civilized again!

This wasnt even meant as a "knock", its amazing how butthurt people get here when you say anything that could be even remotely considered "bad" about bitcoins.
Ive been in crypto since BTC was about 5 dolla, none of mine have been stolen but there were constantly threads popping up of individuals and.."businesses" getting jacked, you cant fucking deny this.
Obviously its entirely their fault getting phished/breached etc, hell one of the best things about coin is how utterly irreversible it is imo.

getting a lot of hate for this simple statement, just feel I should clarify it is quite simple to secure your wallet to a high degree, *however* people are still constantly getting jacked because of their own iignorance. We dont have to deny this out of some kind of fear of scaring away new adopters.

this is nowhere near as good as any of yalls, but for me it was when I ordered something with this strange internet funny money and promptly got half a gram of very good cocaine in my mailbox...
this was when BTC was at about 5 dollas, I knew right then that this shit was for real, nobody sends you cocaine in the mail for a scam.
only after some SR experience did I really look into the implications of a decentralized currency, and it just started to click more and more

this is the best answer I got from all of these and its basically what I was trying to say.
Im not "knocking" bitcoin, I could care less if people get robbed because they werent paying fucking attention.
one of the main benefits of bitcoin is precisely the fact that i DONT have some kind of illusory safety net a la paypal, just like cold hard fiat.
Everyone here took this the wrong way and got their panties in a bunch, im glad you stayed on topic

Bitcoins are so fucking easy to steal its like some kind of virtual return to the wild west.
Id be willing to bet the percentage of crooks that know about bitcoin is higher than the % of..."law-abiding citizens" that know about it

This is great thank you very much.
Still would be great to have something "official" though, as meaningless as that word is.
We need a "white paper" on this shit honestly, thanks again

hahaah "pickpocketing"?
you been playing a wee bit too much skyrim, bruv?
Pickpocketing is a very hard skill to learn, alot harder than firing out thousands of phishing mails and waiting for fuckwits to take the bait.
On the other hand, if you said: "buy a tire iron and rob a nigga" I would say your argument is valid in terms of simplicity, although perhaps not in terms of consequence..
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:13:35
ya in retrospect i realize how that could have been taken the wrong way..
people are always gonna get robbed, regardless of how they store their wealth. hopefully they learn from their mistakes
(id still be willing to wager more criminals know about coin than normal folk however, hell I heard about it from a small time crook and the man is no tech expert by a long shot)
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:09:51
again, that was not necessarily intended to carry any negative connotations..
I realize now how it could be taken that way, but I still think some of yall need to remove the silky hoserie from your ass-cleavage

oh fuck off, I want accurate information from this sub, not some kind of pseudo-veneer of "professionalism" which you could just as well call mild censorship.
If the general sentiment is so-and-so should go fuck themselves, and good reasons are given why this is the case, well then who are you to bitch about it?
I would suggest you waste your time writing a letter to some editor, you pretentious moral vanguard.
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:14:06
heh I had to look that up...
why would acknowledging that virtual thievery has picked up since the dawn of crypto be spreading "fear, uncertainty and doubt"?
if it is, its only spreading... "fud" to fucking idiots. I think its a bigger disservice to the "community" to act as if this isnt happening a lot. learn from others mistakes and all that.
The fact that criminals have embraced crypto in so many fields is a testament to its merits above all else.
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:22:43
probably not.
Hell no ones ever stolen mine and im no fuckin wizard. Read my other answers if you want to know what i meant

lel I was not aware that Karpeles looks quite the man-child that he does
