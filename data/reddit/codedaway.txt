# Notes from Video
* Roger fails to answer any of Lopp's questions and instead says they are impossible to answer.
* Rogers regurgitates the same constant points he uses on every video and in every discussion. Almost every answer contains provable lies.
* Self promotes only investments he’s been part of shamelessly. Although he does mention Coinbase and accidently Bitpay.

I downloaded the video and the captions. I have the captions but the write up is me *somewhat* going through and correcting the words.
I can provide you the entire transcript, I formatted it so it's just a giant wall of text and there are a lot of incorrect words in it. Let me know if you want it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:12:47
I'm trying to understand the "why". It doesn't matter what the algorithms are or how many it uses, but if the reason why is because it would use up too much space on a chip to compute then that would be a reason.
The algorithms are known
How to solve them is known
All it takes is to submit this information to an ASIC design company and they will design it, this part is not that complicated.
ASICs are magnitudes more efficient and more than likely all of these algorithms would hash magnitudes faster as under a dedicated engine vs GPU as well.
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:59:04
You must be missing the fundamental aspect of this whole thing. Exchanges would be third parties and in Lightning you do not need third parties.
The way you are typing, Paypal would be what you are looking for....
Not only that but Lightning is tied to the BTC blockchain, what you are suggesting is a bunch of IOUs from third parties.
It's hard to explain as there's so much incorrect with how you believe LN compares to some internal database of IOUs from exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:09:54
Yes, I'll be setting up the FAQ soon. It's a work in progress :)

Eventually it will be as easy as it currently is to send BTC and even that's becoming easier as new companies create interesting solutions and user interfaces.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:03:30
Thank you for this explanation, I think the question was more towards how to stop someone from sending hundreds of millions of satoshis at once through your node to themselves causing stress on your node. Does it even cause stress? Does the fee structure of LN nodes prevent this spam?
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:14:32
Incorrect, you have to look at the entire ecosystem to decide what Bitcoin is, users, miners, developers, companies. It’s easy to know what is Bitcoin and what is an altcoin personal opinions aside.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:17:58
Every company has a right to act how they feel they should.
The doesn't mean there won't be consequences for their actions. Most businesses have profit motive, this company was obviously not making any profit from being truthful so they have to resort to this to try and win the BCH marketshare.

Thunder is based on the Lightning Network, if you look at their commits on Github, they stopped developing it basically. You would have to ask them why that is.  was the main contributor and has been pretty inactive for the past year.
You should note that Roger Ver is one of the investors in Blockchain.com and would go directly against his vision for on-chain scaling if they continued developing this.
Thankfully there are multiple other teams developing their own Lightning Network implementations.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:09:51
So short sighted, changing a parameter in consensus does not make a superior crypto.
The lack of people using BCash is what makes it cheaper. Pick any altcoin that has no use and it will be cheaper.

No, please read these questions and answers.
 I’ve heard that Lightning transactions are happening “off-chain”…Does that mean that my bitcoin will be removed from the blockchain?


Essentially a Lightning Network is a Layer 2 solution that is built on top of (On top of means relies on) a crypto such as BTC. It literally cannot work without this underlying crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:48:29
There's no CEO of the Lightning Network, just like there's no CEO of Bitcoin, but there are CEOs of companies that develop software for Bitcoin.

Hopefully I understand the question correct, when using Lightning both addresses have to sign the transaction. Both addresses also have to have a channel which means that the address would have to have been used at least once on-chain (Please correct me if I'm wrong someone).
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:03:46
If you don't care about speed, you may want to switch it to Custom and do ~190/byte
Should be much less and estimated to confirm in about 4 to 79 Blocks depending on additional transaction traffic.

@_date: 2018-01-03 16:19:39
Eh, the gift card analogy is not really correct. It's more of you withdrawing money from an ATM from your bank (BTC wallet) (with a fee) to spend cash as much as you like (no fees) and then put it back in the bank (your BTC wallet) (with a fee).
That being said, this technology will eventually be built directly into wallets and it would be just as if you were using bitcoin today.
You don't really need to learn a new system, you can wait until it's all been built in. The codebase will be well tested before a "consumer" release on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:14:20
Sorry! Fixed the formatting
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:37:26
There are timelocks which allow more than enough time to check if "your being screwed". Very few will cheat because there is no possible way for them to know if you will be able to to transmit the correct transaction or if you have a watchtower doing it for you. If they are caught cheating, they lose all of their funds in the channel.
The only people that are going to cheat would be those who personally know you or people you open channels with that have a 0 balance on the other side because that's what you agreed to so cheating wouldn't cost them anything.
Your whole issue is that this sounds complicated, but it really isn't. These mechanism will be built directly into the software and more than likely automatically report such cases. Others have already stated that you won't even need to pay a fee to these watchtowers because they could potentially just take a cut of what the cheater loses (both you and the watchtower make money).
These are just the inner workings of the software.

@_date: 2018-01-03 13:31:11
I tried to summarize this the best I could to answer the question in the FAQ section
* Do I need a constant connection to run a lightning node?
[Source]( - Not necessarily,
Example: A and B have a channel. 1 BTC each. A sends B 0.5 BTC. B sends back 0.25 BTC. Balance should be A = 0.75, B = 0.25. If A gets disconnected, B can publish the first Tx where the balance was A = 0.5 and B = 0.5. If the node B does in fact attempt to cheat by publishing an old state (such as the A=0.5 and B=0.5 state), this cheat can then be detected on-chain and used to steal the cheaters funds, i.e., A can see the closing transaction, notice it's an old one and grab all funds in the channel (A=1, B=0). The time that A has in order to react to the cheating counterparty is given by the **CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV)** in the cheating transaction, which is adjustable. So if A foresees that it'll be able to check in about once every 24 hours it'll require that the CLTV is at least that large, if it's once a week then that's fine too. **You definitely do not need to be online and watching the chain 24/7, just make sure to check in once in a while before the CLTV expires**. Alternatively you can outsource the watch duties, in order to keep the CLTV timeouts low. This can be achieved both with trusted third parties or untrusted ones (watchtowers). In the case of a unilateral close, e.g., you just go offline and never come back, the other endpoint will have to wait for that timeout to expire to get its funds back. So peers might not accept channels with extremely high CLTV timeouts.
Let me know if there's anything incorrect or something that needs changed.

No, every transaction on the LN is signing the movement of Bitcoins between keys. Each of the transactions can be submitted to the blockchain for settlement. You cannot send Bitcoins over the LN that you never owned or had access to.

Sold 2.7 Million of BCash back in December, a much less liquid market than BTC on GDAX. You can easily sell 10 Million on a larger exchange, I’d recommend selling in batches to reduce slippage. You would have to ask for a withdrawal increase to be able to get it out but as long as your legit this shouldn’t be a problem. Will probably want to try to get this increase done prior so your not stuck waiting.
Current GDAX withdrawal at 1 Million/Day.
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:12:14
You would still have a fee market.... my understanding is that you'll be able to fit more transactions in a single block. So instead of needing $30 Transactions to compensate miners, with the additional transactions that fit inside a block, miners obtain the same payment but clear more and less expensive transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:03:31

 What needs to happen for the Lightning Network to be deployed and what can I do as a user to help?






Fee's "go away" once you are transacting on the Lightning Network. As more transactions move to the Lightning Network, **hopefully** that puts less pressure on the main chain and reduces fees for opening and closing Lightning Channels.


Since we're seeing the first mainnet purchases and companies using Lightning already, it's safe to assume adoption will start this year once the Lightning Devs come out and release/say their mainnet versions are safe from loss of funds due to an unknown bug. Currently they are not 100% positive, so they are cautious and want additional testing.


Spread the word and get others educated so that when a mainnet version is released to the public it can be quickly adopted and you can start paying for things with it! Right now there are a few businesses that are ahead of the curve and are implementing the Lightning Network like TorGuard
* [TorGuard accepts MainNet Payments]( - They will also [cover loss of funds](

@_date: 2018-01-06 23:22:46


By definition "Hubs" would not be third parties and simply repeating the statement does not make it true. 
There isn't any custody ever involved. It's just like forwarding packets.


It's not that because you have both parties signing transactions that can be broadcasted at any time. Again you are not behind that third party and furthermore, that third party can't simply refuse to pay you after they said they would. IE Exchange locking your account.


What you're trading with the LN is unconfirmed transactions - just like Bitcoin. The only difference is that these transaction only 
occasionally get broadcast to the Bitcoin network.


Please show me this, link to a source, or provide anything that shows anything like the lightning network that doesn't involve trusting third parties.
If you don't care about trusting third parties then I'm not sure why we're having this discussion on a Bitcoin forum.
@_date: 2018-01-08 15:56:26

* How do on-chain fees work when opening and closing channels? Who pays the fee?
Added the above question to the FAQ, I believe it will answer your question once I can find the correct answer.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:27:10
It is a layer on top of Bitcoin, this means that there's no "activation". It's using what already exists in Bitcoin but with it's own process to make it easy.
The only thing that needs to be done for adoption is the Lightning Devs to say it's ready for the public on Mainnet and then it to be used.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:11:09
So a non-core Developer said their implementation was 6+ months away. When did they release to the testnet? Was it around that time frame?
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:42:29
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:18:19
I think you nailed it but I'll leave this here if you have questions regarding risks that has some sort of backing with information then I'd be glad to add it and have someone try to clear it up.
What we have now is people basically saying "if you wear shoes, your knees will hurt". There's no basis for this, but now people are like "Can you please explain how it would NOT hurt your knees" which just wastes people's time trying to disprove a negative.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:56:17
Can you add more detail to your question? What is too high? Seems arbitrary. If you spend $50 opening a channel and $50 closing a channel ($100 in fees total) but you were able to do 1,000 transactions with that channel then what are technically the fees per transaction? 10 cents?
Your thousand transactions are now off-chain and not on-chain which is reducing the transaction load on-chain and thus the fee pressure as well causing fees to lower in theory.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:19:47
There are ways to currently use it on the Mainnet but the devs recommend not to until they feel it's more safe. I also recommend listening to the Devs but again it's out there if you wanted to use it. I currently don't have a link directly to that branch.
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:24:22

A fork is a change in consensus rules, lightning does not effect consensus rules....
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:43:22
No, once you have a channel open (Paid a fee on the blockchain), you can then send and received unlimited times until that channel is closed and as long as you have the funds and routes to do so.
Example if you had 1 BTC in your channel and you bought coffees for an entire year through your channel and that cost you 0.2 BTC for 300+ transactions, then the channel was closed you would have just paid (2) on-chain fees for over 300+ transactions.
Hope this makes sense.

Sure 
It's for testnet and once lightning is geared up for mainnet (it currently has already been successfully used on mainnet by devs) there will be one for mainnet.
As far as transactions, the only transactions that are known by explorers will be the ones that go through the channels they are part of. Also these channels won't be able to determine if the sender was the original or a relay and if their relay was the recipient or another relay.
Hopefully I explained this correctly. Still learning myself.

For the sake of correctness, KYC is just "Know your customer". All this is, is being able to know who is using your company to transmit funds.
AML Policies are what are actually happening here and freezing your account. I'm sure they know who you are but their Anti-Money Laundering Policies are freezing your account upon a closer inspection.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:33:11
The amount of dollars of a fee is irrelevant, it's about the fee per byte or weight used. Your transaction might have been larger in those terms and the fee was not enough.

Thanks for pointing that out! Changed on the main post :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:32:57
LN should lower the fees on the blockchain by helping ease congestion of transactions actually on the blockchain. Less transactions on-chain = less fee pressure.
The beauty of the Lightning Network is that as long as there is a route to get to someone you want to pay, you can do transactions with anyone in the world off-chain as many times as you want (Not just the same address) as long as no one closes the channel (Broadcasts it on-chain).
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:05:07
A lightning wallet is a lot like a hot wallet is today.
You would be able to send funds back and forth from your LN Wallet to your Cold Storage Wallet on-chain. All Lightning Wallets are hot wallets by definition because you have to have your keys active in order to transact and provide signatures as you send/receive funds.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:56:04

I understand, maybe it's the way I read into that particular post.
I'm not against other cryptos and it makes sense that you would have BCH and want to use it since it was given to you for free due to the hard fork.
I guess my point is that when you "bought back into BCH" you could have purchased a number of other cryptocurrencies that were not actively attacking Bitcoin and have wider adoption for your use case.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:07:44
No, this question is answered in the FAQ of the main thread.
It's going to be too risky for a person to do this as they do not know if you are watching or if you have a third party watching.
You are free to setup as many nodes watching your channels as you want at different locations etc.. but in the real world, you will have plenty of time to "check" on the transaction state and submit the correct state if an old one was submitted.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:02:38
How is the fee big if you don't know what the fee is or when the transaction was made to determine current fee market?
You are assuming that even after the massive savings of Schnorr Signatures on hundreds or thousands of UTXO that the transaction fee will be large. It may or may not be depending on the current fee market.

Great questions,
The TL;DR is yes, the wallet will automatically do most of this work for you. Funds are never locked up between a channel that doesn't send, the network will find another route if needed.
I'll be putting these questions on the FAQ so that you get a more detailed response.
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:13:15
Added these, Thanks!

@_date: 2018-01-11 18:45:17
What do you mean it isn't here?
It's being vastly tested on testnet and there's been mainnet purchased with it already...
If you want to see what happened to the development, go hit up their Githubs that I linked and see for yourself.

No, I want to implement as many space saving techniques that make our blockchain more efficient and then fork if after we exhaust all of those options for a larger block size.
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:31:29
I don't think this question can be answered. There are multiple dev teams working on their own implementation of the Lightning Network. There are already tests being done on the mainnet and you are more than welcome to use it but the devs recommend not to because there's a chance bugs still exist that could cause issues with your BTC.
If you question is
 When will there be a public Mainnet release for a Lightning Network implementation?
Guess you'll have to follow those projects closely! I don't think there's a date yet for the general public.

People/Companies that want to take part in the Lightning Network will have to switch to Segwit pushing that 10% upwards.
Quite a lot of users of Bitcoin already use Segwit, it's the companies that are lagging behind which make up a large percentage of transactions.
There will be an economic incentive to use the Lightning Network over the main chain due to fee savings which won't be ignored by companies wasting tons of money on fees.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:29:46
You could easily sweep them into a cold wallet after, if you felt that was more secure. I think the point was making is that it would be instant, no fees up until you decided to sweep it. At that point you already control the funds and it's your decision on what to do and how much it will cost instead of an employer or service they use.

I'm very knowledgeable at the costs, timeframe, and reasons why an ASIC would be created.
One would only create an ASIC if the price point of the Coin being mined allowed it.
It actually doesn't cost "millions" to make an ASIC using larger nm technology.
You could easily mine this back within a short period of time in terms of the money put into it as long as the PoW wasn't changed since you didn't announce it to the world!
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:53:21
To be completely honest, I don't believe core really cares. They are too focused on improving Bitcoin. It's really up to the users of Bitcoin to make sure these types of deception are dealt with for the sake of other users and potential Bitcoin users.

Testing is always needed, the more testers, the more bugs found and reported. However there's a shortage of Developers that can squash these bugs so it will take longer to get additional versions out versus having more competent devs working on the project.
I do not believe those tweets are meant to say that they don't need money or testers, just that additional devs is really where the bottleneck is right now.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:43:41
I definitely agree that there were and continue to be bad players in the market, especially including Bitmain/Jihan. I'm sure they are stuffing their blocks with their own transactions and we know they've done this before as well as mining some empty blocks for no reason.
When there is a difficulty change we can also see the "spam" in the network as well, my point is that while these tactics happen, they should not last long but because of the stupidity of these companies not batching transactions and not implementing segwit, they are actually causing the majority of the backlog.
All in all, this is going to be just a blip on Bitcoin's history. The future is bright and while there's a lot of drama right now, developers are chugging along to make things better.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:42:51
Great suggestion, added. Looks much better!
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:12:06
I completely agree with you but honestly I think the majority of transactions are from actual companies who are bloating transaction volumes by not enabling Segwit/Batching transactions. I'm sure some of these companies are playing a political game but always remember...


Edit: On the flipside I definitely agree that altcoins are simply an "I want it now" solution that with additional Bitcoin improvements, will ultimately make obsolete. Although altcoins are a great testbed for new ideas that are not entirely fleshed out.

@_date: 2018-01-13 02:12:39
Lightning isn’t the end of scaling but it is a substantial part of it. There are other improvements which allow additional transactions per second with our current blocksize. At the point of everyone in the US using bitcoin, the current state will look much different.

Honestly, with the meteoric rise in Bitcoin's Price, this allows people to be extremely careless and "dumb" about wasting money for quite a while. Eventually the entire system will even out (If the price doesn't do another meteoric rise), if it does then it will just take a bit longer. In the mean time, Bitcoin Core developers all around the world continue to make Bitcoin more efficient with Schnorr Signatures and other improvements.

The system already allows for this, nothing is truly being changed. Software is being developed that simply allows users to take advantage of these features that are already included in Bitcoin.


Correct, however the idea is that by 2049 and probably long before then, the hardware needed to run a full node will most likely cost even less than it does today even if larger blocks do happen on BTC. There will also be tons of innovations including schnorr signatures, MAST, etc... that allow more transactions to fit inside the same blockspace.


I don't believe this will be an issue as mentioned above. You can calculate the costs/rate of new hardware and storage and also estimate the size of the blockchain at any given time in the future to come to this conclusion.


Barely anyone knows about, has, or uses Bitcoin right now. This concern is unprecedented because you do not know the BTC/USD price in the future or the mining difficulty. How can you possibly know what the future will hold with profitability? If the price per coin is $500,000, how many coins are needed as fees to maintain the profit? There's many factors at play here and with the difficulty algorithm, BTC/USD price, more efficient ASICs, you cannot possibly know but the mining market has always sorted itself out without concern. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:12:07
Correct that the network can only find a route if there is capacity in every node in-between. If there isn't any route in the entire space that has the capacity, you'd have to setup a direct channel with your receiver. They would not need to match the funds you send, they could have 0. 
We have no idea what the upper limit of capacities will be and how limiting those routes would be. At some point it would be more beneficial to simply send a Bitcoin transaction instead of a Lightning Transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:22:23
The person has two choices
To cheat and broadcast an earlier state
Not to cheat and broadcast latest state
If they cheat and the other party has no watchtowers and doesn't come back online to submit the correct transaction then the cheater wins.
If there is a watchtower that submits the latest transaction or the other party comes online and submit the latest transaction then they win all of the other channels funds as compensation for cheating (Risky for the cheater as he doesn't know if the other person would come back online or not or if they have someone watching it).

@_date: 2018-01-12 21:20:06
That's a valid concern that's impossible to predict. Currently we have high fees, solutions like the Lightning Network, Schnorr Signatures, MAST, RSK, etc... are being developed to reduce that fee pressure. The majority of these solutions are simply trying to make the inefficient blockchain more efficient before increasing the blocksize.
On the front page today, you can see as clear as day how many transactions Coinbase is doing on the main chain cause congestions and fees to be higher. The above improvements may reduce their transaction to only a percentage of what they currently are. It will take time though unfortunately.

That being said, at this state it's not for the average person... it's only for those that understand and use Bitcoin currently.

I read over the article but I'm not entirely sure I understand what they are trying to say.
The incentive is to have essentially free and fast (Trusted 0-Confirmation transaction) transactions that can be "streamed". This simply isn't possible on-chain.
Hubs may open just to make some interest on Coins they are holding even if it's a small amount. Hubs will likely be businesses and their incentive is to be paid by their customer so they will have to have channels open and available to do that, naturally creating a "hub".
Let me know if I'm missing something as I do want to answer your question correctly.

I don't think this question is worded correctly, there already is a fee market and there will always be a fee market....
If you mean do I want mining to be sustainable on today's fees or not then the answer to that is that I just want mining to be sustainable always and that depends on how many transactions can get processed per block.
Could you just let me know the point that you are getting at? Without increasing the block size you can include more transactions in the same 1 MB block with higher segwit adoption and schnorr signatures along with other improvements. This enables lower fees but ultimately the same payout for miners as there are more transactions in a block

My understanding is once you broadcast the "anticheat", you effectively close that channel and take all of the funds. There's nothing left for the cheater to cheat again. Of course they could attempt this by opening another channel and trying to cheat again.
However cheaters do not know if someone has someone watching transactions for them when they are offline

This does not matter.
[Answer Found Here](
Lightning Network channels will naturally tend to form along the paths of economic activity. If you assume (as I do) that most economic activity in Bitcoin today is from individuals to large Bitcoin businesses (mostly exchanges), then you should further assume that most channels will be between users and those very same large businesses.
You can call the centralization if you wish---but it is not a centralization of Lightning's making; it is a centralization that already exists for Bitcoin users.
Moreover, even though Bitcoin commerce and trading is dominated by large businesses, there are quite a few of those large business. I haven't looked up figures, but I would suspect that Bitcoin commerce has a much less centralized distribution than mining at the present time---and with new businesses offering Bitcoin-payable services all the time, Bitcoin commerce would seem to be in a steady of progressively becoming more decentralized.
Another excellent answer is [the one below it](
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:54:58
The solution to that is Schnorr signatures. If I understand correctly, it would combine all of those micropayment signatures into one instead of each having their individual which would massively save on the bytes used for the transaction thus reducing the fee massively as well.

There are other solutions being worked on that will increase the amount of transactions that can fit inside 1 MB blocks. Also the majority of users and developers are not against a blocksize increase (block weight now I believe)  once those solutions are implemented.
Right now Bitcoin’s blocks are not efficient, somewhat like stuffing those plastic bags filled with air that are used for shipping inside a trashcan then complaining that the can is full and going to buy more trashcans instead of popping the air bags first to be able to fit more inside the same can.
The narrative that altcoin pushers want you to believe is that we’ll never move from this blocksize and that’s simply insane. We’ll move when we want to and not some scammy altcoin pumpers and lazy non segwit using exchanges want us to.

No it's the worse solution inherently. Only people that are uninformed read into the drama honestly and they just circle jerk the other uninformed users.
"Bitcoin Core" is a dev branch and they do not "pull off" forks (Hard and Soft). The whole ecosystem creates consensus and then forks towards the solution if there's another people wanting to.
There's literally NOTHING at stake right now. If you are worried about market cap, alts, anything else then you simply don't understand bitcoin. There's a reason why all of the devs and all of the prominent figures in Bitcoin don't even engage in this drama very much, it's because at the end of the day it doesn't matter.
I don't mean to offend but because you use the term "ignore" I have to assume you are uninformed. Go look at the solutions currently in development on the dev branch, go look at the solutions being discussed, go read up on the lightning network that is currently on the test net.
IT IS REASONABLE FOR A PERSON THAT ONLY WANTS TO USE BITCOIN TO BE A LITTLE UPSET RIGHT NOW AT THE FEE COSTS
That being said it's also reasonable to tell you to go use alternative cryptos until this is resolved if this is the only problem you have with bitcoin. Once these solutions are in place you can come back and this will just be a blip in the growing history of bitcoin.
There seems to be a lot of concern and "I need it now" mentality which is simply uncalled for.

!Attention! Could we please direct the energy of trying to get a blocksize increase towards the actual problem of Businesses/Exchanges not adopting Segwit and not combining their transactions causing unneeded fee pressure?
There's no doubt in my mind that once the majority of the ecosystem is forced to change from using the blockchain wastefully instead of efficiently and correctly then the community will come together for a blocksize increase in tandem with the lightning network. While these fees are shitty for users, these businesses need to feel the pressure in order to change because obviously the thousands of voices asking them to isn't enough.

No problem, I understand that wording can be confusing. I just took this chance to clarify. Glad you understand.


I agree that if the Devs came forward, they would do so with well reasoned and explain them through various medium/reddit/github channels. It wouldn't be done through closed doors in an agreement between businesses. They would also do their best to also gain consensus before implementing. This being said, since this has not happened then you can rest assured that this solution isn't the correct one currently, no matter how you feel. I suggest trying to reach out to some of the more vocal devs via PM and maybe express that you want to know more about why it's not the correct solution as they would be able to explain it much better than I would.


I was that poster and you made an assumption that I'm ignoring the issue at hand. I understand the solutions are being developed and I've been on test net with Lightning Network so while you believe there is this big issue, I feel much more relaxed with regards to it.

This is insane, you do realize why those other blockchains are "Fast and cheap" it's because their use doesn't even compare to Bitcoin. If they were doing the volume of Bitcoin they would run into the same issues.
Also supporting scams like bcash instead of using LTC or another altcoin is hypocritical if the only thing you care about is transacting fast and cheap.
Now if you believe in the bullshit ver and others are spewing that's another thing, I'll assume you just don't know any better but watching this video might help you understand why blocksize increases are not the way to scale.
There are a lot of uneducated people spouting uneducated opinions because they are too lazy to understand the WHY and just want it NOW.

I really don't. We're on the cutting edge of technology. There might be thousands of ways to do something slightly better but from what I see, the current Bitcoin dev team and lightning team have the best approach and I do not mind waiting for such a solution.
You keep saying Fast and Cheap like this is the only thing that counts. If that's all you want then go use PayPal and use the send to friends and family option.
There's a balance that has to be created with Security and Decentralization. A lot of other cryptos just say well we're decentralized enough, our security is enough. I much rather have a system where decentralization and security are first and not given up just to support adoption but instead grow stronger along side adoption.

It’s not sustainable and their “fixes” are just ideas and change the fundamentals of the coin itself.
It’s not about how many transactions can be done, it’s how many can be done while maintaining the most decentralization possible, the most security possible, and not having to do hard fork after hard fork every time the coin grows.

I already acknowledged the problems and their solutions, please read.
BCH is at $4k because of transparent market manipulation. The fact you even mentioned dominance tells me everything I need to know about you. Market Caps mean jack shit. The more cryptocurrencies there are the more it gets diluted. Bitcoin is by far the most used and widespread and will continue to be that way.
For those reading this conversation,
is a holding of Bitcoin who wants to transact using crpytocurrencies, when told to use paypal he says he wants to use crpytocurrencies, when told to use crypto he says he can't because it's not accepted anywhere.

On the other hand with even a tiny amount of research, most of these questions were already answered a thousand times.

I'm not extremely familiar with that but this issue at it's base is extremely simple. If it's free or close to free, it will be abused. While this wasn't much of an issue when the Crypto community was small, it isn't small anymore and the cat is out of the bag. The only solution is to find something that CAN be abused but not affect the network or other people and this is what lightning does along with other sidechains.
There's an outright lie that everyone that supports the current direction of Bitcoin wants high fees. I don't know a single person that wants high fees, this is just a means to an end. Bitcoin has seen unprecedented growth and if we simply bend and fold and change the fundamentals of the technology just to be able to appease the masses in the short term, we will lose what makes Bitcoin so valuable in the long term. Solutions will come that render altcoins useless except for speculation. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:38:57
This is essentially what Lightning does
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:37:22
Essentially you would only need 1 channel, if everyone using lightning then why would you care if it’s locked up since that’s the same as if you were just holding the BTC?
I’m not understanding your “paying someone fees other than who you opened a channel with”, do you not do this already with mining fees?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:03:17
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:53:51
I agree and honestly it's not uncalled for. I personally didn't think fees would get this way before we had a solution, but on the same hand....
I didn't think we would have Jihan Wu controlling a large majority of the BTC network but promoting BCH while (most likely) doing things that cause issues with the BTC network.
I didn't think the largest Exchanges would be the last to adopt space saving/fee saving upgrades to their systems including Segwit and Batching transactions.
I don't think anyone realized the amount of wasted time happening because of the BCH crew and their constant bickering/astroturfing/slandering.
These definitely speed up the fee costs and caused a slow down in development time.
I'm still as confident as ever that when the dust settles BTC will still rein supreme, continue to develop the best solutions to problems, and have the top developers in the world doing that development.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:09:44
No I’m saying it would NOT be more simple to use another coin.
To dumb down the answer so you can understand it, using lightning will essentially be the same as using an altcoin.
The long answer is if you keep using altcoins to save on fees then assuming everyone does this you would be constantly swapping around to other coins which in turn means more steps and less simple. 
Thanks for playing!
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:12:40
I agree with you that in a perfect world (with regulation) that money needs to be watched constantly at every transaction, however this is simply not feasible due to the amount of transactions that exchanges do. While Bitstamp is not in the US, I'm sure their regulations are mostly the same, having obtained a MSB license myself for BTC ATMs, the only requirement is when a customer/client cashes out. This is when they have to make sure everything adds up and also do their correct reporting. This is one of the reasons Coinbase/GDAX has limits on cashing out even on BTC.
As far as their customer service not responding, that's pretty shitty but then again under the US regulation you are not supposed to tell the client they are under security review but that doesn't mean you can't simply say that it's processing.

You would use lightning for PAYMENTS not transferring to exchanges....

No I got free BCH from the fork
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:21:32
"Why shouldn’t BTC be as fast and cheap as BCH?"
This will never happen no matter what on-chain again. If you were around when Satoshi Dice was "spamming" the network you'll realize that once it becomes "BCH" cheap to send transactions you will see companies and people simply "spamming" again. Before we go into what makes a transaction "spam" I'm simply using this as a classification where unneeded transactions are broadcasted simply because they can and it's free instead of because they need to and are willing to pay for it.
LN allows this to happen again without all of those spam payments being recorded for all of history through individual transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:19:42
Here is the most simple answer.
You open a lightning channel for any amount (Lets use 1 Bitcoin)
You pay a miner fee for this transaction.
Now you can make unlimited payments as long as you have the Bitcoin in your channel.
You can buy coffee for an entire year and never pay any fees (or an extremely small amount if a fee market starts on the lightning network)
You can do this with any vendor that's connected to the lightning network that your channel can find a route to.
Example: Let's say you buy coffee at starblocks. Now everyone that has ever also purchase coffee at starblocks is now connected to you via them. Everyone that they ever connected to is now connect to you.
One of the people you paid wants to close the channel to "unlock" the Bitcoin you paid.
You pay another miner fee.
At the beginning people will be closing channels more frequently but once the network is large enough and becomes the standard for smaller payments, channels will end up staying open for a very long time.

@_date: 2017-12-27 14:38:13
No it actually would not be more simple.
Lightning will essentially be instant confirmation, unlimited low fee (sub pennies most likely) transactions.
It solves the scaling issue indefinitely
Any coin that you use that has Bitcoins transaction volume would be hamstrung.
Uninformed people can’t imagine a scenario will cryptos are doing hundreds of thousands/millions of transactions per second with streaming money in nano or micro transactions. Thankfully the roadmap and development are not up to these short sighted people.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:26:54
Did you just strawman me? What the hell are you even saying regarding private keys and how does that have anything to do with the lightning network?
Two fees versus fees for every purchase. How many purchases do you make a week or even a month? It’s probably greater than two, hence a lot more than 2 fees for visa (or whatever card issuer) you’re paying for.
Not to mention that the LN would reduce transaction on the BTC chain which would lower those fees as well.

The above will take a few months then you'll be put in a queue for the fab to actually physically make the chips. But hey this is bitcoin and you want it now so you pay a huge premium to skip the line.

Ok, sell and you won't lose anymore.


What!? You are now trying to gamble with resale values of miners/GPUs?
As many in here have pointed out. You have a gambling problem first and foremost. If you truly cannot lose a cent more then exit and walk away, focus on your job and don't gamble with your money.
If you're just upset at your trades, STOP TRADING and hold. 
TL;DR here's your options.
1. Stop and exit
1. Hold (Which is still probably gambling)
1. Continue Gambling by trading / taking your money and doing other risky stuff with it.

Yes you have to tie the coins up but this is no different then withdrawing cash for day to day purchases in fiat. What else are you doing with the coins anyways? If you needed them you could close the channel.
Currently there would be no fees at the beginning, from what I understand if someone decides to charge a fee you would just route through a cheaper node. No one will be able to tell you what this fee market will look like but since it’s a mesh network there will likely be thousands of ways to any individual person, it’s looking pretty minimal.
Node operators have to fight other node operators for fees and since anyone can open up a node relatively easy this will help with the fee market that arises from lightning.

BCH would have to go about market adoption just like any other alt currency, but you specifically said that you used BCH to fulfill your need as a currency. Why would you do that when you could use LTC or Ethereum who are clearly more established than BCH. Your blocksize argument doesn’t make sense because neither chains are operating anywhere near capacity.
I’m honestly at a loss for words. The only reason anyone would use BCH over LTC or ETH is because of political reasons or because they were duped.

Awesome to hear!
As someone in Bitcoin since 2012, there have been a wide variety of investments that were "Alternatives" to Bitcoin and received a huge pump and then died. There was a different flavor every week.
While this one is lasting a little longer due to miner, exchange and a few wealthy bitcoin adopters colluding, it's more of the same. Bitcoin will weather on while these others become a distant memory that only speculators and day traders use.

That's a very valid question, these BTC will be a personal gift from me to my employees and not from the business. Hence I had to be paid this amount from the company first and pay the usual taxes on it to allow me to do this.

I say bring it on! But in all seriousness I'm not remotely "afraid" of any nefarious people attempting cyber attacks. I practice and teach all of the best security measures that are known. If that's not enough then how do you expect anyone to deal with Bitcoin on a wide scale.
Generate secure random passwords for every website
Always enable 2FA
If possible limit the IP addresses that can access critical systems
Always double check the URL and SSL Cert
Always sign out when you are finished when on a website
Just the basics!
Edit: Almost forgot to never be complacent, always be vigilant.

Basically the BCH network uses the same mining algorithm as BTC. The BCH network is roughly mining around 2 exahashes I believe. There are single pools and even single companies that are mining on BTC that have more than 2 exahashes themselves. If they wanted to they could press a button and switch to BCH and conduct a 51% attack fairly easily.
The whole point is that this shouldn’t be a trivial thing to do which is why Bitcoin is so secure.
Beyond that the majority of BCH is mined by a single company acting as multiple companies to give the illusion that it’s decentralized.
It’s being pumped by actual known convicts and con-men.
I’m not even against a blocksize increase, but it’s irresponsible to not follow the correct procedures as well as not push additional size improvements prior first.
No matter what your opinion is on the matter, the BCH supporters constantly spew lies and propaganda that is easily, readily, and often refuted but they continue to do so in the hopes of luring the less educated over to their side. This is something I can’t get behind and based on the BTC vs BCH price, the majority of people don’t want to get behind either.
Also don’t forget that BCH also created additional deflation because not every Bitcoin owner split their coins and there are multiple exchanges and providers that have no released their holdings yet, a major one being Coinbase. Once that happens you can expect a sharp sell off of BCH for BTC. I don’t believe BCH will ever die off but as BTC continues forward and upgrades, it will eventually make the BCH purpose obsolete, until then we’ll have to deal with the pumpers.
Edit: Here's a crappy picture for reference 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:44:55

You make money faster and even before having miners by pre-selling which can help fund additional and quicker runs of chips.
Also in cases like Bitmain, they have too many miners which may take them over 51% and cause a lot drama due to the decentralized nature of bitcoin which could depress the price. This is one of the reasons they split up into three companies for mining (ViaBTC, AntPool, BTC.com)

The question you should be asking is not how to avoid taxes, but how to minimize your tax burden as "Avoiding" taxes is illegal but minimizing the amount you pay through the current tax system's laws is legal.
But to answer your question, don't pay taxes if you want to avoid them and prepare yourself for the possibility of being fined into oblivion + prison time or go to multiple local CPAs and find one that you feel comfortable with, pay what they say and live with peace of mind.
This in no way an endorsement of our tax system (US for me) but instead a response cemented in the reality of your situation.

A.) No one knows
Q.) I don't want to buy until the dip, should I wait
A.) This has been said by countless people before you at every all time high, at every dip, and everything in between. The best time to buy if you are on the fence is now.
Q.) I'll die if I purchase at the all time high or if this goes down in the short term. Should I still buy?
A.) Stay far away from Bitcoin because you'll drive yourself crazy. Bitcoin has already proven itself as the main cryptocurrency by far and will continue to hit all time highs for the foreseeable future in the long term (years not months, weeks, days).

Hi, I think you may have confused a soft fork and hard fork.
Segwit was a soft fork and there have been many softforks throughout Bitcoin's history.
As per the OPs linked website
"For any future hard forks on Bitcoin, Binance will take a snapshot at the time of fork"
As you can see they specifically say Hard Forks and then reference those "forks" throughout their post.

This is simply incorrect, there are no "Flavors" of Bitcoin. There are alternative cryptocurrencies that may have copied Bitcoin.
There will always be cheap knockoffs that claim to do this or that better and maybe they do in the short term but only day traders are interested in bcash in particular since it could be destroyed at any minute by a large pool. 
People that want to just make money from crypto don't seem to care about the fundamentals of said crypto. If they did, they wouldn't go near bcash since it's currently a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:41:15
Literally everything you’re saying has been and will continue to be disproved by the simple fact that Bcash exists and is behind Bitcoin in every metric that dictates usage and decentralization.

You are literally saying you simply like BCH because it fulfills your use case and dob’t care about any other reasoning or alternatives.

The photo's metadata says it was edited in Photoshop. This by itself doesn't matter but at the very least we know that.
When you look at the forensic image, you can see where the logo is and the distortion exactly where it is. If you look you can see a bunch of hard edges which makes it seem obvious that they slapped it in there with photoshop

ETH is not an emerging tech, it's literally nothing more than an altcoin used with smart contracts for (mostly) scam ICOs and shitty startups with whitepapers to con investors out of their money.
The only reason ETH even exists is because bitcoin's smart contracts were not ready yet.
ETH's price is a direct reflection of the amount of ICOs that went live. The ICO craze forces people to purchase ETH to participate and now that the majority of them are producing nothing, left with the money, or were outright scams, you'll notice the price is going nowhere.
Edit: Bring on the downvotes ETH shills, you ultimately missed out on a shit ton of money because you thought bitcoin was always "at the top" and wanted to get into the "next best thing". Bitcoin will continue and always be the next best thing, once you realize this you'll stop being so bitter.

Again I cannot stress enough how much I would love there to be more competition but you cannot jump on any new ASIC bandwagon just because it could be competition. Do research! As a previous miner I cannot stress enough that the likelihood of this company simply "copying" or "reusing" Bitmains design for a legitimate new miner is extremely unlikely and what is more likely is this is just a quick cashgrab scam.
Edit: Tin Foil hat time - If this turns out to be "Legit" it's honestly likely to just be Bitmain selling under a different name. They have so much hate that this would be a brilliant move by them to increase their sales by sucking in people who would otherwise not buy from them.

You are trying to compare a few different things at once.


Sure, you could do this and that's fine. However a lot of people do not want to trust any third party and LN enabled trustless transactions. You also can use the LN with any retailer than be stuck with Tokens on one platform.


Also you keep using this word "Cheaper". If you use a credit card, they are paying at least 1% (Probably more) to their merchant processor. With LN they pay nothing, the user pays and it will likely be sub-satoshis for quite a while, even if you take into the account of the two on-chain transactions, currently at 1 sat/b over however many LN transactions you made it will still be sub-satoshi fees.
Quicker? LN Transactions are in the milliseconds, I think this is a non-issue.
More reliable? You are probably right currently as this is brand new technology, however as it matures this will also be a non-issue. At the most your transaction will fail and you would simply have to resend it, comparable to the Merchant Processing company having an issue and not processing your CC payment.

If someone withdraws from your bank account fraudulently and you are not online to defend yourself by catching and reporting the transaction then you lose your money.
How is using LN any different? Well technically you can have watchtowers watch transactions for you for either a fee or a slice of the penalty pie.
Maybe you hate the idea of watchtowers for some ungodly reason, there's a timeout period when a transaction is sent from one party and the other party did not send anything. The standard currently is one week, if you do not plan on being online for one week then simply close your channel until you are certain you are online (Basically like locking down your bank account because you are certain there should be no transactions).

This is actually valid. For instance in Washington State, their hydro 
 dams are constantly producing energy that they cannot store. The power companies were thrilled at the fact that cryptocurrency mining was able to use this "wasted" energy as it provided them additional revenue.
Any place that is burning gas/oil to produce energy is more than likely too expensive to mine cryptocurrency OR a country that is subsidizing unclean energy production which isn't a cryptocurrencies fault.

I literally cannot understand what you are trying to get at.
In the context of what we’re talking about (Bitcoin), the improvements are made directly to it.
If others want to create a blockchain base system with “Fuzzy” tokens and deploy it, that’s up to them but it will be based on Bitcoin’s technology. As I said in another post, Tokens and Blockchain exist together, to use one without the other means you do not understand it. To try and say well Bitcoin isn’t special but blockchain is, seems like you got caught up in the media hype.
I’m still confused on what codebase you think Bitcoin runs on.
Do you think any and all altcoins are not in some way a copy of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:28:02
I think you might be trying to say this but an attacker would have absolutely no possible idea if any "watchtowers" are actively watching their channel for fraud. What this means is that even if they ddos, they could still lose their funds for broadcasting an old transaction.
It is a risky game indeed.
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:59:06
On one hand you are more than likely right but let's throw a little realism into it.
If you want to fight this, the following will happen
* Lawyer is needed
* Lawyer Fees
* Long Court Process
* All funds will most likely be locked up during a legal battle
On the other hands, although pretty shitty, they are giving you the opportunity that most other exchanges do not give after a random "Security review"
* You have the ability to withdraw all of your funds (even though you have to exchange)
Both carry the potential risk as you said with exchange rates. Another uses recommended Tether if that was a huge concern which exists now but you would have to go to another exchange that accepts Tether and do their full KYC.
In my opinion I'd fight this for a few more days before Kraken changes their mind about letting you withdraw at all and just eat this as a bad experience.
I'm all for making things right but it will be financially expensive to fight and stressful.
I just want to clarify that I'm 100% against Kraken doing this and you as the user are definitely in the right, however unfortunately sometimes you gotta take the lesser hit.

Bitcoin Core is the base open source software for Bitcoin. It is not called Blockchain.
You have to have some sort of Proof (of work or something else) and a currency/token for Blockchain to work. It also needs to be decentralized somehow otherwise you are simply using a terribly inefficient database just to claim “Blockchain”.
Altcoins are essentially live testnets for features that can be added to Bitcoin (Core or whatever it decides to be called in the future).

Once exchanges start to accept Lightning payments then yes. As of now I do not know of any exchanges that accept lightning since it's still relatively new technology.
So currently you would open a channel, accept lightning payments, close the channel at your chosen interval (Day/Week/Month) and then send the BTC to an exchange but it would be manual. There may be other plugins that allow this to be automated but I'm not familiar.
BTCPayServer might actually help with this as well. (Open Source)

1% is definitely more than free but to say the same price as a credit card is a little off....
Credit Card merchant fees range from 2.3% to 3.5% and also usually carry a small fixed flat fee in some cases. The percentage becomes larger if you are dealing with low priced goods due to that fixed flat fee per transaction.
So this service would be at least a 56% reduction in fees. While also promoting a better monetary system, providing a PoS platform, no chargebacks, instant fiat conversion (for those that need it), and customer support.
So all in all, 1% looks like a pretty good deal if you don't want to manually deal with all of the above. If you do then save that 1% my dude!
*Edit: I have no affiliation with this particular company and have no idea if they are even a decent company but I do like to help others engage in critical thinking! So while I don't support this company in particular, I do support the premise of 1% being a pretty good value for the services offered.*

That’s fine, if that’s you point then so be it... but don’t come in here pretending to understand how it works and spewing misinformation.
Technically segwit already drained the high fees. After Segwit2X failed, exchanges were forced to consolidate their dust and misuse of blockchain space without the luxury of a blocksize increase saving them. Once that was done they also started batching and slowly switching to Segwit. Fees are low but also remember that Bitcoin’s price plays a big part in what fees cost in fiat. If the price was as low as BCH the cost would be the same in crypto but 97% less in Fiat.
Lighting is already showing promise and is growing exponentially. Faster than even BTC grew at it’s age ;)

Ok I do understand what you are saying now. Thanks for the clarification.
This argument had been brought up time and time again. It simply won’t happen because of Bitcoin’s first mover advantage and this simple fact that no matter what technology “Bettercoin” deploys, it can be added to Bitcoin Core if it truly was needed/better.
So while Bitcoin sits back, maximizing decentralization and security, “Bettercoin” goes off and becomes a glorified testnet for it’s new features making sure that it’s stable and bug-free for Bitcoin.
We’ve seen thousands of altcoins try this same tactic and all have failed but we have picked up a few potential upgrades to Bitcoin from their failures.
I get that in your mind a better product/crypto could take over but that’s now how things work when any better crypto’s improvements can be absorbed into the most secure and decentralized crypto (Bitcoin). It logically doesn’t make sense otherwise.
@_date: 2019-01-19 12:43:27
Incorrect. Bitcoin Core and thus Bitcoin is what would have the improvements. There isn’t a codebase called Blockchain that Bitcoin runs on....

Sure, if some magical new technology that isn’t a copy of Bitcoin is some manner comes around that isn’t able to adopted by Bitcoin due to it being some new breakthrough.... then yes I agree. In the realm of what’s currently available and understood there is nothing that matches this definition.

Bitpay was a proponent of Segwit2x and Larger Blocks. They issues statements that went against the majority of the network trying to drum up support.
They are partially funded by Roger Ver, who is BCash's greatest supported/messiah.
While Bitcoin allowed them as a company to be successful, they have chosen to do plenty of underhanded and strange power grabs throughout the years.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:48:22
You deposited your BTC on a 3rd party exchange that is required by law to know their customers prior to sending them money.
Once you send your BTC to an exchange it does not go into a wallet that only you can access, it is mixed with the thousands of other users funds and their database simply shows you a number on your account for your deposit. That BTC is now theirs and you have an IOU. The exchange then uses their funds to satisfy the IOU when you "withdraw".
Because of this, they are required to know exactly who they are sending their funds to or risk closure (even for 1 BTC). They might require more complex or additional documentation for larger amounts.
I suspect once you submit your passport/driver's license and utility bill then you will be able to withdraw to your hearts content.
I also suspect all of this was in their terms when you signed up....

Correct, Lightning is and uses Bitcoin (and any other coin it is implemented on) and not an altcoin. Con artists continue to try to make legitimate sounding coins with names that are popular in order to trick people into purchasing them.
Lightning is simply a second layer solution that has its own rules with how coins are moved around which essentially keeps a trustless ledger off-chain ready to be broadcasted on the mainchain at anytime.
@_date: 2018-03-27 12:29:47
Just want to say that you are 100% correct. A lot of people really have a poor understanding of how Bitcoin and all of it's forks work. All nodes rely on each other regardless of what "group" you put them in, (merchant, user, miner). As soon as anything seems different regardless of if it's wrong or not then everyone else gets notified and makes a choice, in the event of an attack that choice would be to quickly and efficiently remove the offending group from the network and carry on as if nothing happened.

While an individual can spin up 1000 nodes, I'm going to assume each node is an independent person/company.
The more nodes is great but it's who they are connected to that matters (Channels open with unique other nodes).
Channels provide routes to other nodes which help with being able to reach someone else without having to open a channel directly with that person/company.
Widespread adoption is a pretty ambiguous standard as I wouldn't even consider Bitcoin itself to have widespread adoption. Within the niche Bitcoin community, 1000 nodes is still very small but not insignificant, the software is still BETA albiet on mainnet, most larger companies will likely wait until they see it as out of beta to implement it for their customers but likely already started development on their solutions.
So to answer you question, widespread adoption of the LN within the current Bitcoin ecosystem will happen when we see some larger companies implement it as well as slick GUIs/Integrated Bitcoin/LN wallets become the defacto.

If you want to purchase and run a BTM
You will need to register as an MSB with FinCen (Easy)
Then you will need to obtain a Money Service License from Florida which takes about 6 months at a minimum. You will also have to show that you have $100,000 in cash in your bank at all times to obtain this license.
You are better off just "hosting" a btm from someone that is already licensed and taking a % of the fees.
Edit: Also wanted to clarify that if you intend to not obtain a license while letting customers use a BTM you purchased and/or become a "localbitcoins" vendor, you will face stiff fees and potential jail time as Florida doesn't play around with unregistered money service businesses.

Anyone that says "Let them compete" is exactly what people saying they are a scam are doing, if they are not a scam and have merit then others will find the facts otherwise calling them a scam is true and people are being educated by doing research.

I agree that it's not impossible to fail. However, I'd like to point out to everyone reading what you wrote that it literally can be applied anything financial related.
You also keep throwing this word "Investor" around. I'd like to point out that just because I have some USD in my wallet does not make me an investor in the United States.
Even a soft admission that a government/banks is/are not impossible to fail, I would accept.

Step 1. Don't be a moron
Step 2. Don't be a moron
However, your original post cited using Bitcoin Cash so I'm not sure how these steps will help you.
But in all seriousness, this is exactly the mentality of the majority of Bcash folks, they complain about high fees then when someone tells them "Hey you can use Segwit and pay pennies again", they sit there and look dumbfounded. If they spent less time whining about BTC and instead actually used it the correct way (Incorrect way is paying high fees for no reason), there wouldn't even be a discussion besides the crazies that can't understand how core itself is decentralized so "replacing" them isn't even a valid argument as anyone can simply be "core" by writing useful code.

It's unfortunate that a lot of the "vocal" redditers in Bitcoin are so polarized. It takes a great amount of critical thinking and self awareness to understand that we should judge each elected official based on what they did in their past, what comments they make currently, who is funding them, and what their promises are in the future instead of simply what party are they part of.
One of the largest threats to the USA are people like you that were force fed us vs them mentality causing a huge divide and instead of keeping the brainwashing inside your family and close friends, you get behind a keyboard and try to convince others.
Edit: Just for clarify, based on 's comments in this thread, this is wasted on him/her but hopefully others read and start thinking for themselves and doing research.

Here's the trick, I'm going to assume you are not a programmer or understand the technicalities of the scaling debate since your question reflects such.
If as a non technical person, you say "Hey, this sounds really easy... why are we not doing it" There's a good chance that you are not understanding the whole picture and it's much more complicated than it appears, especially with Bitcoin.
Here's a analogy. Let's say you have a shit ton of those air packs you get inside boxes that protect whatever you received. You fill your garbage can up with them and wonder, "wow I don't have enough room to throw all of these out in this particular garbage can". Do you A.) Keep getting bigger garbage cans to fill with your air packs or B.) Pop and condense the air packs to fit nicely inside the garbage can you already have?
Seems like a no-brainer, optimize Bitcoin as much as possible and then increase blocksizes if needed.

I'm not sure I'd associate toxicity of a community with bad investment advice.

This is one of the broadest whiteknights I've seen. You don't like Bitcoin because you can't stop people from basically gambling is what you are trying to say. If they are spending more than they can afford to lose and are the getting "hurt", that's on them. Self-responsibility goes a long way.
Also for the love of god, no one mines Bitcoin with a GPU. They are mining other cryptocurrencies and maybe then trading those for Bitcoin.

As development progresses it will be more simple to add your own personal Lightning Wallet to your ecommerce store.
There will always be people who are not comfortable in doing that and that's why Merchant Processing companies exist. You would simply sign up with a company that uses Lightning Wallets. It would most likely be as simple as hitting a switch to turn on.

This word bubble doesn't mean what you think it means. There is a market and that market is trying to find the correct price for Bitcoin.
Turns out this is a completely new asset class and finding a price for a deflationary asset based on technology and adoption is rather difficult.
I actually haven't met a single person that said it was a "Stable" investment, but I have heard people say it is a future currency and to that end no one knows if that's true or not and hence the reason for the price being every which way.

Ya, I currently can't imagine a scenario that will not require a custodian in order to do a fiat conversion on the spot.
While I don't condone the use of custodial applications (Not your key, not your Bitcoin) This is an excellent stepping stone as the general population is educated on using crypto.
Eventually (hopefully) these stores will simply take BTC without any 3rd parties. Then we remove the custodians on both sides.

It's literally because they have some of the Core developers working for them. Also because most of the Core Devs (including the ones working for Blockstream) opposed larger blocks.
So the narrative shifted to "blockstream controls core/bitcoin". While it literally has no baring in reality, that is what has been spewed ad nauseam.

There's a difference between "trusting" and literally creating propaganda against someone without substance.
Bitcoin is trustless, what does that have to do with one company? There are plenty of companies throughout the space that have developers with commits on Bitcoin Core. The code can be reviewed and if the majority consensus didn't like the code they are more than free to not implement the changes or even create an alternative.
@_date: 2018-12-18 13:07:14
I think everyone can agree that any attack Bitcoin defends against ultimately makes Bitcoin better (Antifragile). However I wouldn't go as far to say those people are not terrible for Bitcoin, but maybe a necessary evil.
As far as my original post goes, you do not need to "know" or "meet" someone if they are in the public light as their actions and policies are enough to decide without making an assumption if they are not a good person or at the very least not looking out for everyone and instead only themselves.

Without going into detail, there will never be an ASIC Proof CPU only algorithm. No matter what you come up with, as soon as it makes financial sense to develop an ASIC, it will be done.
The only ASIC proofing out there for Proof-of-Work is where they literally change the algorithm so that it renders the ASICs useless. You will still get FPGAs and GPUs doing the work most likely and there would be no way of knowing if someone had developed ASICS or if they simply just added a ton of CPU/GPU/FPGAs to the network.

On all exchanges and platforms where coins are stored, your account should go into "Lockdown" after you change your password. At a minimal until either the exchange contacts you or you contact the exchange to verify details or submit documents again. Saying that this is too burdensome on the exchange would be incorrect. When you submit documents like a driver's license, their API automatically parses the image just as they do on Bitcoin ATMs.If it has trouble parsing it, it can read the barcode on most licenses which keeps all of the same data as the front.

Using cryptocurrency without a third party will always require some level of tech-savviness, which is good because hopefully that also includes learning about security.
At the end of the day, the masses will simply use a third party app or website where all of this is done in the backend for them and all they need to do is click a few buttons to send and receive. You wouldn't be able to tell the difference from receiving from venmo, paypal, zelle, etc... except that the entire infrastructure is built upon the bitcoin network.
