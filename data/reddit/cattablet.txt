The idea of the sub is to get the most out of credit card rewards. The have the ideology that if they have to spend money, why not get rewards/cheaper prices for it?
This can lead to some outlandish habits though. Some cards have requirements like spending $2000 in a time period. Managing this on top of multiple other credit cards can make it difficult and will have a higher cost than reward to some.
The sub's wiki and sidebar have a lot of information if you want to read more about it.

Not infinitely divisible, but divisible to a point where it is irrelevant.

The macroeconomic goals state that there should be price stability.
Deflation may dissuade people from spending the currency, but it still fills the three functions of money: medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account.
Though I do agree, a currency that people are afraid to use is not a good thing.

But those things you are talking about are the bare minimums. Sure someone will still choose to pay rent, but they wont spend money on other things such as eating out as they know it will be worth more later. Japan is having this exact problem it is currently experiencing deflation, and many people are saving money while skimping out on other things^[\[1\]]( .
Also in a Keynesian model you shouldn't need to invest money. The point is to increase GDP without increasing inflation. Perhaps you are getting the two confused?

There is a username visible, but it is not an active username. The actual comment can be found [here](

If all of the transactions have to be broadcast for second layer solutions, couldn't you just count those?

I'd argue that the priority of those should be switched. Buying food is most likely more urgent than a car.

It really shouldn't be something you design. Random passwords are more secure.
A password and your key serve the same purpose, to unlock something.
Sure having a key that you never need to input anywhere is "safer" than something you type on a daily basis, but it still boils down to unlocking your data.
Even still, the mnemonic can be phished just like a password, albeit it should be a lot more obvious that it is a phishing attempt.

I'd say it's a lot easier to get one person than it is a whole bank.


And they don't know there's money in your bank account unless you tell them either. Stealing from a bank and from a wallet are different things. If I rob a bank, I steal from everyone there, not just one person.


Because a bank offers services that crypto doesn't (currently, if you really want to push that point). If I were to keel over and die, my spouse/descendant/whatever would be able to get my money, where if I had it all in crypto, they'd have to hope I wrote down my private key somewhere.


Go ahead and go to my bank, it's worthless to you since you don't know my password to log in. And then even if you did, I can say it was a fraudulent transaction and bring it to court.


This is about stealing from a bank, not other things. If it were the same as putting cash under my mattress, sure, but thats not what the point is.


Bitcoin IS irreversible

Which, what do you know, 24 words happens to be a password.
