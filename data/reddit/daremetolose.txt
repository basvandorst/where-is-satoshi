I was just about to say the same thing, Roger will up the bid and get it listed again, then we will try to take it back down and he will have to continue upping his bid to keep it up. Progress is better then nothing!

1st: I need to figure out what you just type.
2nd: With that type of vocabulary, I can already make a judgement that whatever you're planning to do is a bad idea.
3rd: Log out, read a book, and stop thinking/typing out your ass. You're not 10 anymore, you're dealing with real hard working money, make your own grown up decision.
