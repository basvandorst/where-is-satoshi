Pay it forward Bitcoiners
Look at what can happen with a little good-will -- by this I mean 4,500 MIT undergrads to get $100 worth of BTC in the fall...each!!!
Things are looking up, up, up and away!

Hi elementelrage, I have been looking for info regarding this. Please tell me, did you simply receive an e-mail from CAvirtes announcing your shares? or have you filled out and submitted the 5 pages of forms?
The reason i ask is because I have yet to perfectly understand what all the legal jargon means and have been hesitant to ink my name to a contract I don't fully understand -- i am not in a position to hire a lawyer for this.
Would you be willing to explain how you went about "getting" your shares and in what format they arrived?
Many thanks for reading this -- I hope it is not too much to ask for.
Cheers, FM

further, if you live in Vancouver there is no palm scan, no I.D. requirment, no nothing. Walk up to the machine send it coin, withdraw cash. easy peasy.

The price on Bitcoinity already did something like this with no major fallout. They moved the price from being denominated n bitcoin to millibits. Overnight they moved the decimal 3 places  and then put a HUGE banner up saying "Don't Worry..." This went pretty smooth. Personally I like the idea of people being able to hold numerous bitcoins -- it'd make people feel like they actually have something. blowing out a couple undred bucks and seeing a fraction of a  unit is, for most ill-informed people, very counter-intuitive.
Long live Satoshi!
