No, this IS good for Bitcoin.

Could be. I sold at $14. I sure as fuck ain’t psychic.

Same here - this is starting to remind me of the run-up to 1k in 2013. Things need to cool off a bit.

Bitcoin itself is not a bubble - bitcoin is a currency/asset. Bitcoin is currently experiencing bubblesque price behavior, which has happened multiple times in the past - but it’s recovered each time after a cooling off period. 
Bitcoin’s price is a function of its utility in exchanging and storing value, so its relative value will increase with increased adoption - the long-term trend is still positive even if we drop 50% today. 
Bitcoin has experienced multiple bubbles - it still has a high potential to experience several more bubbles. But the long-term trend is positive. 
tldr: hodl.

Survivorship bias. The brave and bold that fortune favours ignores the masses impaled on the stakes that Mr. Brave&amp;Bold managed to avoid through both skill and luck. Yes, hodling wins long term, but anyone who invested in the wrong month of 2013 could very easily have been ruined by timing. Same holds here - I think we'll see 10k soon. I also think we'll see &lt;4k. And then we'll see 25k, then 100k. 
But timing matters.
