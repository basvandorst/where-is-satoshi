another bitcoin bash under the auspices of "rehabilitation". This will clobber the price down since kobayashi is selling btc for fiat, they never rehabilitate with btc, I wonder why.

+1.. This is the exact question I was about to ask to gain more insight from other redditors here.
TBH, they can sell what they seized and I wouldnt be surprised if one day we would come to know that the opening of those future exchanges towards btc, while not holding any physical btc to counter these contracts were also part of that move, its the old game of warping the asset base via future contracts, done on the LIBOR, Gold, Oil etc.
People without the knowledge above succumbed to hedge their btc via futures, where at one point in end of January the futures became the leading indicator for both human investors and algo alike. The initial cost *and* margin calls of those contracts are arguably paid in liquidated btc fiat money.
So there you go, I truly think that government is manipulating prices via exchanges and im sure this is not the only tool at play.

If you joined this venture understanding:
A. The moment you invested you could lose it all.
B. Your not selling at anypoint, just waiting for forks or maybe a few barters for other functional coins.
Then you're fine.

If one wants to create a shitcoin from bitcoin, one must first sell bitcoin, get fiat and only then create the shitcoin.

IMHO its politics and as some of you are aware, coinbase is planning to have its own etf. So maybe those Winklvoss' bros are serial losers..
 In anycase, the SEC is looking for a controllable ally, who else than coinbase is right for this?

Guys your missing the point... Slovakia is thriving to be a leading nation in crypto.

Seller gains fiat, loses bitcoin
Buyer gains bitcoin loses fiat
When the trade book has more people willing to buy bitcoin for a certain fiat price, and when that price fills and executes, the next price in the trade book is a higher fiat price to buy bitcoin and thats how the value of the bitcoin/fiat ratio rises/falls and vice versa.
Bottom line is that its all about pwrspective of value, if you value bitcoin more than fiat and put your money where your mouth is.

The more people are alive, the less resources and higher cost per capita, that is irrefutible.
