You are not very good at providing examples. You cite the two largest heists to happen, neither are being cashed out. This proves my point that they aren't cashing things out. You haven't provided any proof for your own case.
As for sheep.
This wasn't the scam. But yes block chain analysis was used to fuck them. Oh and this too
Whoa looks like the cops used block chain analysis to fuck him too. Maybe you shouldn't be so hasty in providing examples that only help to further your opponents cause.

*sigh* What do you think blockchain analysis looks like? It's following wallets and finding out who owns the wallets.
This link was in the article I linked but I don't go on forbes since it's such a shitty site to deal with over tor but I did just for you.

You can't educate those who don't want to learn so I'll just stop right here.

For the most part they aren't even cashing out. They can't. Everybody is watching the wallets and as soon as it moves we all know. These people are hackers. Hackers are the most careful people on the web and they don't make moves like this unless they won't get caught.

Deepweb is everything you can't access normally including tor, i2p/similar services as well as internal company networks and the like, most of the content on the internet exists on the deepweb and is generally inaccessible by the public. The darknet is a subsection of the deepweb for hidden services that use encryption with specialized software (tor, i2p, etc) to hide their IP and activity and their respective users IP and activity from each other and/or malicious actors.
