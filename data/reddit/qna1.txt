I have seen this statement made many times, and have a few follow up questions.
1.  What dictates if your node is involved in payment routings by other users?
2.  Lets say over time your node becomes really popular(for whatever reason), would a simple rasberry pi be enough to handle an increased amount of traffic through your node, or would you have to change things to handle the increased traffic?
3.  I have heard that right now the "little percentage of routing fees" you get from the your node would not by any means be anything significant, by today's means.  But lets say in 5-10 years Bitcoin sees massive mainstream adoption, could this mean that at that time, your bitcoin node could potentially be generating a relatively significant amount of money from the traffic that uses it?
Thanks in advance for any answers.
Edit: wording

I saw you make this same post a while back in another thread, and it really is illustrating.  Before, I saw owning 1 BTC as the goal, now the much more achievable  0.1 BTC  is the goal, and anything more is icing on the cake for me.

Just because you said this so confidently is exactly why BTC will double in value in the next month or two.  Not that I want it to, I'm enjoying the discounted prices, but you have now jinxed it, and ruined my plans, so thanks!

Chill out, I was clearly just joking around, no logic needed.

Haha, I can only hope.

Holy shit, so does this mean that at some point, the "definition/standard" for the amount of sats equal to a bitcoin can be changed(increased/decreased)?

I wasn't trying to make any particular statement(I don't see why I was downvoted), I was just generally amazed by the realization, that the amount of total sats that equal to "1 bitcoin" is arbitrary, so if need be you(by you I mean the bitcoin developers) can increase /decrease the total amount of bitcoins by just adjusting the number of sats equal to 1 bitcoin (not that they might ever have any real reason to do this though).  I get that the set number of sats will always be the same though.

I have wondered for years why bitcoin hasn't seemed to put a dent companies like Western Union(barring more widespread adoption, of coarse).  That said, I would definitely like to know more about your startup, if you have a website, and you don't mind sharing.

Hey this is cool, I am rooting for you.  I am planning to start a crypto-blog, and this is exactly the type of thing I would like to feature/talk about and will definitely look into more, thanks so much for responding.
