I didn't say anyone was a genius, just that they're making money. He's saying bitcoiners are retarded.

Great chart.

No retard. They get multiple tickets from the same person because they run a shit site and don't solve problems. How is that a fail in logic you stupid fuck?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:31:57
People who're making a lot of money are retarded?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:49:16
So you have no bitcoins now?
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:27:28
Maybe they're swamped because they ignore tickets and don't solve problems.

is the website bitflyer.jp?

You say logic fail then don't respond with any logic. You obviously think you're way smarter than you are.

These exchanges are swamped with support tickers because they can't run their fucking sites properly. They're incompetent cunts. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:32:55
when is that?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:15:41
what if you're european?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:39:09
It's really amazing how many of these exchanges are totally incompetent. They rake in so much money and can't use it to make a functioning website. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:52:21
Yeah. Everyone is just waiting for it to go up enough they can cash out and break even, so it keeps going down after every pump. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:51:21
i'd love to see a poll on that. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:46:02
I really would like to see a poll of users in the red vs black. Would be interesting. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:59:30
It will probably get removed by the mods unfortunately but I hope it stays up. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:28:54
I agree with that.

I'm kicking myself for not selling at all time high. Someone asked me if it was a good time to buy in and I said no, it will probably crash soon but I didn't listen to my own advice. I still sold at 9k but I should have done better.
