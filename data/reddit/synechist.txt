I don't think that's correct. You don't need to wait for Bitcoin to support a proper decentralized peg on the following idea:

The Blocknet will soon release the tech to deliver Ethereum services to nodes on any other blockchain. In all likelihood you won't need any other project.

Great work folks. This may well be era-defining.

You're absolutely right here, and XC will not formally claim "100% privacy" until its code has been audited, publicly reviewed, tested, bountied, and used in the real world.
100% privacy is a weighty thing to claim, and it needs due diligence before such a claim is made.
About that:

Yes that's correct - roughly coinshuffle plus multipath. The former dissociates sender and receiver, and the latter fragments transactions, concealing the amounts sent/received.
At base, Web 3.0 is implemented via the "Xnode protocol", which is the end-to-end encrypted protocol by which nodes communicate. Content is stored in local storage accessible to the node and indexed on the blockchain.
Nodes earn revenue by serving content. Nodes that serve it first/fastest/most consistently get priority (depending on what matters for the content in question) and therefore get paid. "Content" ranges from ads to static webpage element to personal files and chat messages. There's also a traditional frontend for advertisers/clients/consumers to use the network.
In comparison with other projects, XC's web 3.0 project is in keeping with the rest of its tech: an emphasis on privacy and security; completely serverless and distributed; a flexible platform upon which potentially anything can be built; and open source on a delayed timeline. This would make it more flexible and general purpose than Storj, more like Bitcoin than Maidsafe, more privacy-centric but not Turing-complete like Ethereum.

We've been in touch with Kristov and a review is on the cards. He seems excited about XC.
- You can't see any security holes. It's closed.
- Nobody went back to the drawing board after Rev 1. Where did you get that idea from? Rev 1: Xnode protocol. Rev 1.5: Mixing. Rev 2: trustless mixing. Rev 2 (finalised): ad hoc meshnets. It's a progressive development plan, as per the roadmap.
P.S. What's up with your tone? Take it easy man. People will think you're just being emotional.

Hey hey
If a node drops out of the meshnet, the mesh just resyncs and carries on as per usual. Nodes dropping out is a normal occurrence on a mesh (especially mobile meshnets), and they're designed to continually reconfigure their topology. So a node dropping off the face of the earth is "normal" behaviour.
This leads to the central point: nodes don't receive just coins by themselves, they receive the entire multi-party transaction as an atomic tx, so it can't be broken into parts and thus they can't steal anything. Each participating node can either sign or fail to sign the transaction, in which case the node just gets banned. If it does sign, then the correct amount of coins are sent to the correct recipient.
If even a single node refuses to sign, no coins are sent, the bad node is excluded, the mesh resyncs, and a new transaction is passed around for signing. If all sign, then it's good to go.
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:02:06
An ad hoc mesh doesn't strictly involve the blockchain, since it's just a mesh of encrypted communication channels between nodes.
What does involve the blockchain are transactions. In XC's case, its "trustless multipath mixing" involves a single atomic transaction between multiple nodes. This significantly *reduces* blockchain size, since instead of having multiple single transactions, only one multi-party sig tx is recorded.
@_date: 2014-10-03 08:25:21
XC didn't post this. Someone else did.
Take a look at XC's price action: it is not getting pumped. Price has been stable for the entire quarter. Therefore it's clearly not some pump-and-dump.
So if XC cannot be a P&amp;D, and if XC isn't posting this stuff on Reddit, I think it's reasonable to be more patient here. XC hasn't even launched yet; its code is yet to be [bulletproofed]( it'll be open source then. And then XC will post about themselves.
For now, I think it's best to just ask good questions about its tech.
@_date: 2014-10-31 10:43:20
Ah well, let's just say that it's particularly easy to create whatever "screenshot" one likes. Truth is not served in the process.

Cryptoarticles covers Dan Metcalf's statement on the Blocknet/XC smear campaign
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:04:32
Ring signatures generally bloat the blockchain and do not offer flexibility in terms of what the user makes private and what (s)he discloses. 
The latter point is important, since real-world use-cases require a menu of options for disclosing and revealing info. For example: prove how much was paid; prove that it was you who paid; prove that the recipient was paid when (s)he denies it; publicly prove that x received amount m without revealing who sent it; and so forth.
XC's tech was designed from the start to provide this degree of flexible privacy, for the real world.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:57:37
I think there may have been papers published (somewhere on the web) pertaining to coinshuffle before 7/7/14, when XC's tech debuted.
XC only discovered coinshuffle around August though. Funny how this sort of thing can happen - a bit like Liebniz and Newton. Not that coinshuffle and XC's tech are the same. They're "analogous" at best.

Ben, if you can't get people to like the Bitlicence, they'll just move to something like [XCurrency]( put the app on their phones, and face no further challenges to their privacy or freedom.

The original motivation behind the smear campaign: to prevent a potential merge between SDC and XC. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:28:16
XC makes claims based on what's actually been developed and released.
Those who want to verify the claims can:
- test the software
- confirm some of the claims on the blockchain: 
- chat to Dan (ATCSECURE on Bitcointalk)
- watch it get audited, then publicly reviewed, then bountied, then open sourced.
Sounds like a good ride to be on, IMO.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:13:26
I agree, and I'm from XC. You really should wait until XC's code has been audited, publicly reviewed, tested, bountied, used in the real world, and made completely open source before trusting it. This is important.
Before then, by all means, try it out. 
XC hasn't even launched yet. But it will, soon.
@_date: 2014-09-23 08:17:45
You might want to contact XCurrency. It runs an ad hoc (i.e. session-based) meshnet for private payments and has a distributed content server in the works.
Obviously it wouldn't be helpful on the hardware layer.
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:55:42
Nice perspective, and you're on the money there - we've announced an upcoming TOR-replacement technology based on the meshnet. The current meshnet does not forward web content in general, just packets related to payments and chat messages. In the very near future, it will handle all sorts of things.
OSI is crucial, and when we open XC to third parties, their apps will all be distributed applications incorporating (or running as) nodes on the XC network. Bitcloud's perspective is a solid one.
Regarding an OSI4 transport layer, get in touch! aculwick

The perpetrators of the smear campaign against Metcalf, the Blocknet, and XC revealed:
@_date: 2014-10-03 00:13:00
Claim: XC has a session-based meshnet that trustlessly mixes transactions analogously to coinshuffle - except that its multipath architecture also fragments transactions.
No other coin has anything close to this.
What XC does not claim: that it's been audited, bulletproofed, publicly tested, and made open source. If you're disputing and of these latter points, I concede. 
Revisions and updates come almost daily. It's at an early stage. Yet it's live, working, and real. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:18:06
A more technical explanation of XC's tech is here: 
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:20:13
Pertaining to 1: yes you're absolutely right: XC's code has (mostly) not been made open source yet. I'm from XC and I agree that if you're privacy-conscious, you really should wait until XC's code has been audited, publicly reviewed, tested, bountied, used in the real world, and made completely open source before trusting it. This is important.
Before then, by all means, try it out. 
XC hasn't even launched yet. But it will, soon: 
Pertaining to the rest of your points: they're loaded with emotive terms and factually dubious claims. You come across as a having an agenda.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:08:27
Closed source? Nope.
XC has not even launched yet. I don't think it's reasonable to expect or demand that it be open source already. Give it a few short months. :-)
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:05:04
TL:DR - "well, fine, they're not a scam, but they're copycats ok."
You should find out about the Blocknet before trolling. For example, SuperNET's multigateway has a (semi-) centralised architecture based around groups of servers, whereas the Blocknet's decentralised exchange will be truly decentralized, facilitating exchange directly between peers. 
So you are incorrect that the Blocknet sits around and copies SuperNET's developments. Please engage constructively in future.
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:24:07
Good point - and I love the idea of decentralized prediction markets (c.f. Truthcoin).
But I think Bitnation is, in fact, about distributing decision making in the sense you advocate. This is because it's forkable and voluntary.
By being voluntary and by being forkable, it will create a competitive dynamic between multiple versions of Bitnation and between nation states, so that users "vote with their feet". That's a pretty free market.
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:59:04
Just go to github and compile yourself then. It's open source after all. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 12:19:05
Even if you can run a full Bitcoin node on your phone now, it's pretty clear that this is (a) a sizeable space commitment and (b) pretty much guaranteed to become more and more of a commitment as time progresses.
Popular blockchains just don't make good mobile solutions. Multipurpose chains make even worse mobile solutions. The answer: microservices served over interoperable blockchain networks.
