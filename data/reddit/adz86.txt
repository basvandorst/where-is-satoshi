Since my thread I posted (twice) isn't appearing in "new" - maybe mods are deleting it :
* Is there developer updates?
* A roadmap?
* A timeline for implementation?
* Updates on progress?
I think we all understand we need this now as BTC dominance is at an all time low and alts are surging. I keep hearing Lightning has been discussed since 2015, if we aren't increasing the blocksize, when is Lightning going live and rolling out?

Because they are printing money and would rather invest their resources into other stuff that's going to make money rather than something that will benefit the consumer.

Contact the exchange and hope they help. It can be a complex and long process to do the extraction, often taking more than 20 business days
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:14:59
But.... why? $20 in fees, 1-2 hour confirmation for a $5-$10 meal? Trying to be logical
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:31:10
Why is this post not appearing in "new"?
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:26:35
Honestly I don't mean to be a fudster but there has to be a correction before we transcend. It's happened every time during huge gains and it will happen again. Before buying - ask yourself do you feel like you are getting a good deal? This is just sideways. I can't see a bull run until we hit between 7-8k correction at a minimum. 6 is probably unlikely

Why the fk is BCH 9.5k on GDAX

1. No
2. Not sure. People have done the sums and say it's not worth it unless you have lots of money to invest in specialised minings rigs - and lots of it.
3. Cold storage, and only on exchange for the amount you are day trading.
4. Probably - check tax in your local country
5. Easy - just sell it on the exchange same way you bought it. Each exchange charges their own fees - usually &lt; 1%
6. Not sure, maybe if you make a trading bot but I'm sure they already exist
7. To the moon.
8. If there was a global conflict - probably everything would crash, stock market, fiat, etc. Who knows what will happen to crypto.
9. Futures is just wall street trading on future value of bitcoin, but not actually transferring any bitcoin in the process. Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork which is now trying to take over Bitcoin by using the Bitcoin brand awareness, redirection from bitcoin.com, and people with lots of money (Roger, Jihan) who want Bitcoin Cash to take over for personal vested interests. Insider trading and market manipulation is rampant.
The community here acknowledges scaling is a problem, but we will resolve it ourselves, not Bitcoin Cash. If it was as simple as increasing the block size, we would have done it already. It's not a long term solution. I do not agree with the censorship on but I believe in Bitcoin. 
Buy the dips, enjoy the ride, don't buy into the FUD.

Was all the TA and bears wrong? Looks like a pump... I'm still fearful of buying in this mini bull

Bitcoin needs to fix their shit asap. Absurd fees and long confirmation times. We need lightning NOW. 18 months is too long in crypto world

@_date: 2017-11-29 11:52:27
My mate told me about bitcoin in around 2011 and again in 2013. Yup. Fomo.
But whatever man, we missed the boat on Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, Uber, IBM. You should also regret those just as much.
But whatever. This boat is still very early man and now is a good time to buy some. Crypto is still only known by us computer nerds even if you are just learning now. Imagine once it goes total mainstream.
Grab a beer, buy a bit and enjoy the ride.
Hodl and see you at 1mil *micdrop*

@_date: 2017-11-16 00:46:53
It's going up. Buy now. Nothing on the horizon to indicate a dip

Wouldn't replace it, but would greatly hinder it's ability for mainstream adoption which is crucial for bitcoin to explode out of the stratosphere and hit the moon
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:40:59
I disagree. A tv commercial selling a product and you being a source of information to people you know is two different things.
But anyway, do what you will. Just tell them to DYOR and that you aren't giving financial advice. And turn your phone off on the market correction.
It's a similar thing as to why I don't like fixing family computers - but here money is involved.

The coinbase weekly limit is annoying too. I have added some funds to btcmarket also
I assume coinbase and btcmarket are pretty much the only good options for aussies?
How long after your first transaction does coinbase offer increased limits?

IT's HAPPENING

What's better to buy on for aussies, Coinbase or BTCMarket? Is it generally the same fees in the end?

In answer to your questiosns 
Dunno 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:46:13
Will it even drop by 1-2k? That would be a massive drop?
I'm also trying to make the same decision when to jump in as a first timer
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:02:40
This ain't even the dip. Saddle up
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:55:21
Even with the 3.99% fees Coinbase still seems quite a bit cheaper unless I've missed something??
Only problem with Coinbase is the damn $500/week limit at the moment (new user)
Everywhere is showing sub 7k at the moment ($6,912) on Coinbase, BTCMarket is still $7,261 USD best sell price. Like wth
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:20:42
Looks like it's dipped as low 6671 and bouncing back
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:59:08
€7050 makes sense. What's the problem?
When you go to buy it converts it into your local currency (with I've noticed a ~0.5% premium)
Then the fees on top of 3.99% on cc

No don't be stupid. Don't buy on credit
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:08:37
I have the same feeling as you
After Coinbase being slow as hell and crashing, and the newbies having their first taste of a dip and panicing, I think they'll take their small profit/return and bail

Right here with ya
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:31:13
Hold it for 10 years
Or buy when it drops pre/post fork in the apocalypse everyone is predicting when shit hits 4-5k
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:00:42
Bitcoin may go down too. Confidence in the economy wiped out.
Or it may go up as people flock to bitcoin as their investment?
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:03:35
Now is the time. Tomorrow we'll be knocking on the 12k wall.
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:09:41
This would be a concern. But as more companies take it on, if organisations don't accept it they will be missing out on a piece of the pie.
What's not helping bitcoin is how difficult it is to transact, and fees at every single step to do anything.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:22:50
Works if you are in the US. Sucks for everyone else. Meanwhile on BTCMarkets it's 7143
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:53:57

Is there a way to make the Price Chart full screen rather than Depth Chart?
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:14:57
Probably easier to guess credit card numbers
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:16:33
Oh GDAX - so close. Couldn't eat through the wall at 9950 - how you gonna do 10k bro!?
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:23:28
You know where you bought it? Someone sold it to you. Think about that
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:34:16
Don't gloat. You'll be eating your words if it drops to nothing. This is a high risk volatile investment. I'm sure other people thought the same in the dot com and stock market boom - many people ended up losing their lives due to losses.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:00:41
Sound reasoning... if Bitcoin survives. If it doesn't and governments/banks release their own worldwide crypto currency, well... yeah
But I'm a newbie. I only just bought my first 0.1 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:14:38
Mate I've been waiting for any non shit coin to go down
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:27:19
Seems like an interesting system. Do you have any spreadsheets to work out what your buy price is at each bracket based on current market value?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:41:07
Imagine the US puts a tax on crypto. To hell instead of the moon.
Does anyone else worry that crypto is so closely tied to the USD for intrinsic value?
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:45:28
Noob question. I have my coins currently in BTCMarkets. 
1. Transfer all coins from BTCMarkets to Coinbase atleast 24 hours before fork (BTCMarkets transfer fee 0.0005 BTC)
2. After fork, transfer all coins from Coinbase to my new Ledger that is yet to arrive (Network Fee most likely to be around 0.005 BTC)
Does this sound like the right approach? 
How long does the actual transfer take? i.e. How long before the fork should I transfer into Coinbase seeing as they said they were disabling trading (buy, sells, sends and receives) 24 hours before fork?
I am in Australia if it makes any difference
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:58:26
20k mate I see that in less than 6 months. The question should be when is 100k?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:43:17
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:15:20
Didn't buy. Still waiting. Where's 8k at?
Not enough of a correction yet imo...
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:19:07
Sell it to me. I'll give you half of market price :P
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:00:30
Drop it like it's hot. 9k LETS GO
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:53:17
If you buy now, or at the previous ATH of ~7.3kish, It won't matter in a few months when Bitcoin is 10k
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:11:23
No just leave it on btcmarkets. No ongoing fees for leaving it there.
Otherwise transfer it to a wallet. Transfer incurs a .0005 BTC fee
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:57:54
I have about 1.5k for my first bitcoin investment ready to go on btcmarket... but so much speculation about a large dip to 5-6k in the next 1-2 weeks. I can't bring myself to jump in right now 
Guess I've waited this many years, what's another 2 weeks eh? Next minute no dip and 8k ukh FML
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:19:57
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:31:52
I also don't understand it.
I see it dropping in GDAX but on BTCMarkets where I have about a few k ready to drop in, it's still high - about 5% overpriced
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:34:01
Crash you good thing. CRASH
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:35:16
bitcoin cash down 45%. Pump and dump. Feel sorry for the poor guys that got sucked in to the propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:04:33
But where is the low dip? Wherrreree. Lol
I'm holding off though. Not buying at a massive ATH bull rally

@_date: 2017-11-03 12:36:27
There may not be another big crash. It could increase to 12-15k, the crash may be a dip to 12k.

Now at 0.3 BTC total... all in the $7k mark
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:07:59
I should buy and take the hit for all you guys, guaranteed to crash soon after!
Bought near the ATH but whatevz, hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:14:29
Haven't done a trade yet on BTC but struggling to understand perhaps you can clarify for me
Coinbase 8902.21 AUD + 3.99% fees = $9,258 
BTC 9298.75 + 0.85% = $9,378
For BTC I just clicked on Buy Bitcoin "Best Sell Price" as I haven't yet done a trade on their system yet so not 100% familiar
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:53:05
Now we wait for the dip
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:20:23
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:26:53
Omg buy the dip!
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:12:16
I'd also note that Coinbase charges you from an account in the UK. So like me in Australia, your bank charges you a $15 foreign fee which was super annoying so I won't be using them again. Also no GDAX support in Australia
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:55:25
Why? Telling your friends and family to buy and giving financial advice for such a volatile high risk investment is a recipe for disaster.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:57:35
You margin traded and got owned. That's the risk you take.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:23:27
About 400 BTC - 4 million dollars
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:29:33
Blew my load at around 8-8.1k lol for my buy funds
Hodl or sell and pick up down the dip? Is this shit going down?
The general market across alts seems to be recovering quickly too not just BTC
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:38:40
No most likely gone
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:27:04
You and me both

Lol. Percentages bro Google it
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:01:44
I think it's done. Bull run to 12k?
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:39:03
The damn thing just doesn't drop. Comn bitcoin. Give me a decent dip to jump in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:32:02
Was that it!? Weak dip was weak
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:28:50
It's dead
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:09:47
No. This ain't a shit coin
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:41:10
I bought a small amount at 7200ish. I'm waiting for the big drop before the drop to buy more
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:37:34
Ahh ok so basically they aren't sure themselves. So I don't think my ledger will arrive in 12 days. What's the best private wallet in the interim for Australian customers to get the forked coins?
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:12:20
Australian banks are pretty much ignoring it, but have said they are "exploring"

Before I bought crypto
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:50:21
I know the feeling bud
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:45:42
That would be nothing lmao

It's a big pump now. At around the 10k mark there will be strong resistance and a large sell off probanly to 8.5k as people taking profit. Buy that dip, not at the current ATH.
But if you are in it for the long haul it won't make much of a diff buying now or waiting for a 10% dip
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:53:33
Am I allowed to ask how many btc you have now? Or is that a sin in this forum
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:28:09
Don't bother

Computational power increases year on year. Your phone has more compute power than all the computing power it took to send someone to the moon

You can probably use it as it should be tamper proof but for peace of mind get it direct from the manufacturer as that's what I did.
Is saving $10 really better than your sanity?

I just want to see 6.5k
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:02:41
Why do they mandate how you can use your coins? Does the bank say you can't use your money for gambling?
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:01:42

Sure he does. Dude is a scam artist
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:21:50
Yes - large mining pools who control the mining is dangerous. Satoshi didn't anticipate this in his vision.
Over 50% of the miners would be in China
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:56:17
Oh fantastic. Thanks for the news. I can see they are supporting it and giving the coins also
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:54:46
Where do you guys see this bottoming out? 6k?
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:06:28
Not I. It hasn't dropped enough. This is just minor sways. The real dip has still yet to arrive. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:19:07
Well my fiat funds transfer STILL hasn't made it to the exchange. No cheap BTC for me :( 
Have I missed the boat 5.7k USD?
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:14:42
buy now. I don't think it's likely to dip much if at all. Even with the current bitcoin cash/shitcoin pump (up 25%) - bitcoin has held. It'll only go up once the dump from bitcoin cash happens again
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:28:59
Zomg at peak. I kid. Gl

Thanks for this, I watched the video and have a verified GDAX account now.
My question is, how do I get funds into GDAX from Australia? It seems I can only  get funds into GDAX from Coinbase and with Bitcoin? In Australia I can't deposit into Coinbase via bank account, only Credit Card

From what my noob brain understands, Bitcoin is a source of storing high value but not useful for day to day small transactions. Bitcoin Cash seems to fill that gap.
From a mass adoption perspective, the fees are too high to be able to use Bitcoin for daily transactions, the fee would cost more than the cup of coffee itself
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:15:53
Right at the peak nice timing
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:30:36
Well, what wallet is it?
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:46:34
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:06:26
JUST BUY IT NOW FOR FK'S SAKE
I kid
But seriously bro - buy some now.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:48:16
I'm going balls deep in the next large dip, which should be in the next 10 days
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:51:31

Why does the Litecoin and Eth charts on coinbase mimic the Bitcoin charts exactly? like to the tee?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:01:11
Move on bro, don't think about it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:43:28
Upvoted. This needs visibility
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:43:13
Don't do it

Could major advancements in computing destabilize the algorithms?
Perhaps if governments make it illegal to use and start monitoring everyone 
If a better digital technology comes along that's way better than block chain
If governments release their own coin
Who knows?
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:47:57
If huge corps have 1000000 mining rigs, that's a significant investment and cost they have to make into mining.
It then becomes a cost vs benefit scenario, and the bitcoin price has to be high enough for them to make a profit. Also there would be alot of coins still in circulation in the market.
It's kind of like saying what happens if a huge company stock piles all the US Dollar.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:17:48
what happened last time?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:22:14
10k could be the area where a large majority of people pullback to 8-9k? After seeing the huge correction they may think this isn't for them and just want panic out.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:16:21
Cool story bro
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:56:54
Why not wait for the dip correction in the next 2 weeks before jumping in again
