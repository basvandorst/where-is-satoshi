In this case I would say you wrote that section, so you shouldn't need to credit anyone else as an author.


In this case you clearly had someone else write a portion of the code (as you admit). Therefore this person (or people) should ALWAYS be listed as co-authors for the app.
And while you do not say outright "I'm the sole creator of this application", we can cut the shit. We both know what you were trying to get people to think when you posted stuff like "I'm 16 and I made an app..." because you mention NOTHING about anyone else. Not in your post, not in your screenshots, not in your comments. And that is your "promotional" or "release". It doesn't matter that you credited them on Facebook or whatever, or if you credited them as a "mentor". They are not a mentor, they are an author. They wrote some of the code that you are using.
And you say "I coded everything on my own (with the help from 2 mentors)" which is a straight up lie.

I'm sorry, but how am I sexist?
None of my post was implying that I was saying this because she's female. It has nothing to do with it. I'm happy that more young and/or female students are getting into programming, it's exciting.

Did you mention that you were a 16-year-old, homeschooled, Indian girl?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:06:24
Yeah idk. I feel like she is using the fact that she is young to try to convince people that she's a prodigy without explicitly saying that. Once someone called her out she jumps to the "well you're being sexist" accusation, even though I never said a thing that was sexist.
That being said it seems like she *truly* believes she's the author of this app and merely had some "mentors".

My meaning behind it was to show that her intentions were not pure. She utilized the fact that she was attractive and female in order to convince me to comply. Trust me, I've been through 13 years of schooling plus another 4 years for my bachelor's, I've seen it all when it comes to people using me.

Well now you're just accusing me of being sexist for no reason. No where did I say that she used be *because she was a cute girl*. No where did I say that all cute girls use people. No where did I say that a cute guy wouldn't use me. I said that she *used the fact that she's a cute girl* because that's what I am attracted to and that's what lowered my resistance to helping her cheat.

Yes I would have, because it was a story about someone using my knowledge and taking my word without attributions, not about the fact that she was a girl.

Okay, let's talk about it this way.
Let's say you were writing the app and you came across a section you didn't know how to do. You go to your mentor or whoever and explain what you don't know.
Did they A) explain fundamentals to you so that you could code the section on your own or B) give you or point you to **code excerpts or sections of code** that accomplish what you were trying to do.
If reality is closer to A, then yeah you wrote those sections. If it's closer to B, then you **must** attribute those people because **they wrote the majority of that section**. It doesn't matter if they said "nah I don't want to be bothered with communications so you can just claim you wrote it". That isn't how plagiarism works and if you don't understand that now you may be in for a rude awakening as you transition into adulthood. 
You said that your friend or whoever built entire sections of the app. If that's the case, they **must** be listed as contributors if you are going to be an ethical programmer. If you took the core iOS code and passed it off as your own because "Steve Jobs said he was not interested and didn't want to get notifications and be disturbed." then you have plagiarized and stole that code.

I'm honestly kinda confused on this whole situation.
It reminds me of when I was in college taking a Comp Sci course, and there was this cute girl in my class who never spoke a word to me. Then mid-way through the semester she approached me asking for help on the programming project due the next day. I explained that I was unfortunately busy, then we had this conversation:


































As you can guess, she *did* copy my work. In fact she directly copied-and-pasted it and then changed the header info and variable names. Obviously the automated plagiarism checker caught it immediately. She and I were both pulled into an academic dishonesty meeting and she told them that she "wrote the code completely on her own" but with "guidance from another student in the class ((me))". The explanations you are giving sound exactly like the excuses she gave the dean. Let's be completely clear: she wrote none of the code. She found people (myself, and probably others) that were experienced, and then took their work.
Now I'm not saying you did just that, but what I'm saying is that you should just be honest now if you'd like to be successful in life. So which portions of the code did you actually write 100% on your own? You admit that you got the "backend" and "caching server" portions of the code from your friend/mentor, what about the rest?

I'm sorry, what? You know that being a minor doesn't give you the ability to plagiarize and then antagonize people calling you out?
