In the Korean exchange, what ways of withdrawal they allow you? Do they only allow withdrawal in KOREAN banks and denominations, or they allow you SWIFT/SEPA twithdrawals also?

I read in the trollbox from their mods, that they have huge backlog on support tickets and btc withdrawals(some people have pending btc withdrawals for more than 96h)

Find a friend that has already the wallet synced :) or partlialy download the blockchain from somewhere(torrents etc) and just sync the missing weeks/months )

They do work, till you want to withdraw. Endless people simply quit trying(they will ask MILLIONS of paperwork for a withdraw), forcing them to simply rebuy the coins and withdraw with BTC, thus the so big premium on the price.

No but i have a theory : if demand spiked that much, and since bitstamp/kraken are the only EU places that you can actually deposit fiat, could explain the premium. Just speculation though!

Go with bitstamp.net  
After you verify your account, you can buy directly with your CC!

Yes. Is reported by people that is next to impossible to withdraw fiat from cex.io due to the enormous paperwork they will keep asking you, no matter if your account is verified. Thus people giving up they buy back btc to withdraw --&gt; higher btc price.

My bet is that all the top players will do that(BitStamp/BitFinex/Kraken). I wouldt touch btc-e though(thry never credited ETCs from the ETH fork)

Well she knows about it, but does she know how much there is?transfer it to poloniex, make it another coin, withdraw them to another polo account, buy back btc, deposit in your wallet, claim yhat u invested in the x y z altcojn which plummeted 99% or u opened a short/long margin position and u got stopped out.
