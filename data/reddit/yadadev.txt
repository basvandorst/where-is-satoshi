I don't see the issue. If someone is cost-averaging over a long period, it makes sense to make many small orders (on either sides).

I think the biggest hole in your calculations are the number of transactions. As the reward for mining a block goes down, it is expected for the number of transactions to go up, hence the fees collected to become bigger. Now whether that will end up being more or less than the mining reward is speculation regarding the adoption of bitcoins.
On one hand, if bitcoin does get mass adoption in the long term, I do not expect any issues: the miners will collect a lot of fees. If it doesn't get serious adoption in the long term... then who cares ?
Also, the hashing power of the network is proportional to the profitability: if it isn't profitable enough, less people will mine, the difficulty will go down, and it will return to profitability. And vice-versa.
@_date: 2013-04-15 10:22:48
A few more thoughts:
- make sure it scales with multiple cores
- design the engine to support multiple front-ends: the engine could sit on a firewalled machine only reachable through specific IP addresses, one for each front-end. That way, you can scale the number of front-ends easily, they can be runned by you or someone else (with a commission), and if a DDOS hits one of them, it's easy to block that specific front-end. Imagine having multiple forex brokers wanting to use your engine (oanda, interactive brokers, etc).
- markets fees are much more complicated than most online brokers expose: fees to add liquidity (limit order not resulting in a trade), remove liquidity (order resulting in a trade), trade fee, cancelling fee, etc. No need to support this right now, but at least design so it can be added.

Best is to cost average over weeks/months.

Margin is about 4k$/contract (  )
Open interest is about ~284k contracts (  )
So about 1.1 billion $ backs that open interest. Bitcoin is big enough to handle that.
If you trade the same contract a hundred times, you do not need 100x more money.
If you do take delivery, you indeed need to cover the full cost (100k$ instead of 4k$), but the majority of the open positions typically roll-over to the next month.
And the whole crude oil market doesn't have to convert at once anyway...

HGSH went from 0.26 to 8.35 in 6 months.

It's really not. For example, in 1985, the Dow Jones was ~1260 points. A 10% move was 126 points.
Now, the dow is ~16000 points. A 10% move is 1600 points.
Yet, from the point of view of a trader, both are 10% move and should be represented the same (which happens when using log-scale).
Using linear scale, the 1600 points move appears to be 12 times bigger (takes 12 times more vertical space) which is ridiculous. The market didn't move 12 times more, in both case it moved the same 10%.

From this (referenced in your link):
"Why did this work? ECDSA requires a random number for each signature. If this random number is ever used twice with the same private key it can be recovered. This transaction was generated by a hardware bitcoin wallet using a pseudo-random number generator that was returning the same “random” number every time."

Problem becomes patching the issue. Say you found a critical bug, there's a chance someone else will eventually find it. So all clients should be updated to patch it.
This creates a problems since there is a small period of time where the patch is released, but clients are not yet updated (since this is not instantaneous).
Anybody who sees the patch will quickly be able to write an exploit.
I'm not sure how to fix this without turning off the network for at least a few minutes..

You can't influence the FED directly.
However, for bitcoin, you can influence the network by running a full node and the code by submitting patches (or paying someone to do so) and then convince other nodes to accept it.

I'm too lazy to make a long argumentation, but I think this should be discussed, so I upvoted.

A private key is just a random 256 bits number. I go offline, choose my random number generator of choice (/dev/urandom), generate 256 bits, then, for extra fun, change a few bits by hand, then use an offline copy of bitaddress.org to calculate the public key/address.

Your best bet is to pay a programmer. But don't give your API keys to him, make a test account (or let him make one).
