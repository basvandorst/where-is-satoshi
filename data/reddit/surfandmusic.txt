@_date: 2018-01-16 04:53:50
and its also been at 15k. so?
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:49:30
keep your cool man
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:54:06
Man you guys are PUSSIES. You like to seem so confident and hopeful when the price is rising, HODL, TO THE MOON, BITCOIN IS THE FUTURE, but when the price dips a little bit y'all are crying like little bitches. Have some dignity!
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:48:18
HODL on matess!
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:41:53
Yupp. 10k is actually the mean price before the crazy spike early December. All this means is that it has returned to normalcy and its all up from here.
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:30:57
yeah right now's a good time. the price has stabilized at 13-14k so its gonna go up from here.
edit: nvm
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:31:42
we've been at the dip.
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:39:53
No utility? How else would i buy my drugs??
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:51:22
I'm in it for drugs?
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:59:26
You can actually see that's exactly when people bought and the price spiked high.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:11:22
I haven't seen anyone else mention this, but don't you think one of the reasons for price dip could be because of people cashing out for the holidays? I know i sold some bitcoin to be able to afford some sweet holiday deals. I think the price will start rising again after the holidays are over.
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:47:15
but then there are after holiday deals which people spend money on. and who the hell receives money for christmas? people receive gifts and gift cards, not usually money.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:52:07
i pull some bitcoin out every once in a while to buy drugs :p
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:31:24
the response i was expecting
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:34:43
Do you spend all your bitcoin gains on heroin?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:29:20
What if you bought, sold the same amount, and then bought the sane amount with that money in an attempt at day trading.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:34:02
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:36:46
here is an example of a shill right here @_date: 2017-11-04 19:04:13
Zimbabwean currency was discontinued after hyper inflation right?
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:47:41
Set a whole day aside just to learn bitcoin, after buying some stuff online several weeks ago and forgetting I left $5 in coinbase and suddenly it was at 5.50. I bought $500 worth today.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:42:29
dude be real you would've spent that on drugs. You're probably better off.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:49:11
man i invested my first $500 at 7.2k cause people on here were like "It's only going to keep skyrocketing!!" FML
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:33:28
darkness is the only friend that answers
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:59:15
why the fuck are all these forks happening?
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:34:48
Hahaha such a shill. Look at this guys post history.
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:30:18
idk but I'm sure we're in @_date: 2017-11-04 19:03:14
Wasn't Zimbabwean currency discontinued?
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:44:12
I just bought my first $500 yesterday for the first time... ughh
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:29:13
There we go
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:21:13
Oouuchhh. I do feel better now.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:09:43
I bought some bitcoins last week for the first time cause I needed to do a transaction. Was surprised when i saw my $5 change to $5.50. It is very interesting how it works. Plus if I wouldn't have sold I would have had $9 lol. So I bought $30 worth today to see what happens.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:43:08
I'm using coinbase. How did it fuck you over? The comment is deleted.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:43:39
Lol this post was flagged for removal. Too many crybabies reporting it lmao xD
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:18:21
dude coinbase customer support sucks. I've contacted them twice since a week and a half ago and haven't gotten a response.
