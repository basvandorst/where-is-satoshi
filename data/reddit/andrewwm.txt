That your theory doesn’t make any sense means it doesn’t fit in with anything at all. Its like saying the theory of gravity ‘doesn’t fit’ with some cramp it internet commentator.

Your argumentation sucks and you have no authority.

Lol how long will the 18,000 buyers have to HODL to recover their money? Not to mention how long o make up for the MANY years they could have just held index funds and increased their wealth at 10%/yr?
Explain to me why BTC should increase at 10% a year compared to the dollar based on the fundamentals of BTC.

Your two statements are contradictions. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:18:36
LMFAO you have clearly never even taken econ 101.

As a percentage of the world's population they are tiny. Bitcoin will help them (maybe - they are low tech mostly) but for 95% of the world's population Bitcoin doesn't offer them squat over their fiat currency.

Most of BTC is owned now by the big fish, the small fish are getting clubbed. Great currency you have going there.

4% growth of what? Real GDP? Globally or in the US?

Let’s see the simple math and evidence. The idea that some of the best minds of generation missed something that requires only simple math is frankly ridiculous.

If they don't understand how fiat currency works then they can't solve a problem they don't understand. 
The reason bitcoin and all the other crypto coins will never be a store of value is precisely because the number of coins available is determined not by supply and demand but by mathematical function. It means that whenever people get interested in a coin and start wanting to use it the value will skyrocket, which ironically will prevent people from wanting to ever spend them which is exactly what is happening with bitcoin.
Choose 1:
1. Coins can popularly used for goods and services
2. Coins are available based on a mathematical function
Programmers don't understand supply and demand so all of their solutions will fail.

The advanced minds are all programmers not economists. They understand how tech works not how currency works.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:43:56
Lol your argumentation is you just make stuff up without understanding the fundamentals of economics. Go post in with your nonsense.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:25:44
Yeah sure that’s why I have a PhD in economics from Oxford. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:04:46
And also school theories were developed by some of the most brilliant minds of the last 50 years. Meanwhile your theory is developed by random internet tools. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:33:02
I'm trying to think of a way of proving my Oxford status to you without giving you the opportunity to doxx me. If you seriously want proof pm me and I will send it to you. Maybe a redacted photo of my diploma with a hand-written reddit time and date stamp.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:47:51
I guess. How often do you need a million dollars in the next 10 min? The use cases for this just aren't compelling.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:05:06
Lol you are persistent, I will give you that. They do when they're drunk and trolling idiots on the PUBG boards.
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:12:17
School theories can be proven with very advanced calculus equations. How do ‘prove’ your theories?
