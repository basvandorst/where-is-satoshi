Lol this is funny. They can't do it at all. Please note that the Bank of England controls all central banks on this globe except a few. That includes the federal reserve. They want us to use a global currency which will be introduced by the Bank of England. It won't work because it's just fiat without the physical aspect.

Besides they can't really do much because the Canada Revenue Agency (government) recognized Bitcoin as a commodity that you barter with and barter rules are to be followed. You pay taxes accordingly.

We use RBC and Coinbase. RBC regards coinbase as a financial institution. When selling bitcoins and receiving the $$ from coinbase it is seen as a payment. So no issues at all.

Bitcoin will increase in price for the following reasons
- European financial crisis getting worse
- German Financial crisis will be on media soon
- Greece will be facing another crisis very soon
    + the above will cause a shift to Bitcoin
- Reduced supply of Bitcoin - We all know this
- Increased demand for Bitcoin before halving in anticipation of higher prices. We are seeing this now!
- Devalued US Dollar due to debt crisis will cause an increase in bitcoin's price. 
- Those using bitgold will benefit as the price of gold will rise substantially. Already NUGT stock (gold miner) increased 900%

Miners will not shut down because the price will offset the reward. Were we mine the cost of electricity has been dropping steadily and is expected to continue throughout 2017.

Everyone is holding on and soon btc purchasing will rise before halving in anticipation of higher exchange rate due to a lower supply of btc to the market.

Bankers can do that all day. It doesn't matter as they are only converting hard cash to digital cash. It's a way to bypass commercial banks and provide central banks the ability to take control of your "digital cash" they supply you. When in the case you have hard cash, it's a little difficult to take it from you when they want to. 
This is why Bitcoin will flourish regardless. It will come to a point where people will value Bitcoin and avoid exchanging it with coins made by banks.

The interest rate for EU central bank is 0% if not negative I believe. Several banks in Europe are charging customers for savings accounts. People are realizing they can protect their wealth with Bitcoin and I see an increase in demand slowly for now until people other countries like Italy and Potugal catch up since their banks "bailed-in".

Contact their support. If you made a bank transfer, it takes a week. If you used interac transfer, should be instant.

What do you use your fiat cash for? Same can be done with Bitcoin. Bitcoin has value. Your fiat loses it every day.

Many hate coinbase but I like it for one reason. Banks love coinbase. They actually see it as another bank, payment processor (like square). Which means if I trade I trade on coinbase and cash out safely. Using other trading platforms and getting fiat back to my bank account is a high risk.
The only thing you can do is show up at your bank and demand to see an account manager. There you can try to figure out what they are "investigating". Remember, you are a (sorry) "peasant" playing a big game they don't like. Be nice, get your money and continue trading the safely.

As we approach the halving event we will see a sudden rise in the exchange rate as people buy more bitcoins in anticipation of an even higher rise due to the drop of bitcoins introduced into the market by miners.

Roger is talking about core's reluctance to increase the block size which increases tx fees. Segwit is interesting but not what the market needs. A block size increase is necessary as well as required.

I think you are a bit off. First of all Slush's pool allowed classic block mining when one person put up a Development proposal to allow miners to choose to mine classic blocks. Which received votes from miners mining with Slush. 
Now I put up a development proposal that concludes the voting and diverts the hashing power of those that didn't vote to classic as it received the most votes. UNLESS a Miner decides to vote to change from don't care or did not vote to BIP100 or Classic or Core. That way the Miner can still vote or change an already casted vote. This proposal was accepted and up for all to see and vote for.

Bitgold is a publicly traded company. So no they are not in the business of scamming people. They just have a terrible customer service. 
I would recommend hiring a lawyer.

It's an equilibriumic cycle. You introduce a new Miner, profits rise then fall as more adopt it. And repeat. This is how the manufacturer and retailers make money. The actual miner makes money right after ROI is complete and just before mass adoption.
