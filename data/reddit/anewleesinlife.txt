Coinsquare, it has an MSB (money services business) number whereas Quad does not. Traditional financial institutions and the government like businesses with MSB numbers.

Absolutely I can, and I can enable email and SMS alerts when someone logs into the account from an unknown device, or attempts to reset the password, attempts to transfer money to another account, etc.


No, it doesn't.

Huh? Cool story bro yourself. Doesn't seem like you've fully understood what has been written. The fact that nothing has been found that beats AsicBoost means nothing since Bitmain already has a contract to use it.

Their customers have insurance, so the burden is on BMO to restore the accounts, up to 100k. Credit unions offer unlimited insurance on deposits :)

Where do you think the copper comes from? From that same damn mine.
So even if the gold isn't used in your PC (hey, it is), the copper certainly is. There's lots of new copper being required for all the coin farms to run their giant ops.

News is a factual account of something, this isn't news. It's a prediction

I can guarantee you that many banks do take security as seriously, because its the law.
You praise Binance for having any security at all in a world where there is no law. Doesn't mean its any better than the rest of the heavily regulated world of finance.

Then you are ignorant. That would be like the banks saying that its impossible for someone to create a better system.
Yet here you advocating for crypto as a better system than they have in place.
There are many flaws in Bitcoin. It is also far too slow for the volume of transactions that occur on fiat or stock markets.

I dunno, I agree with the sentiment, but the pump n dump currencies and malicious stuff needs to go. Fortunately most of the outside world unfamiliar with crypto doesn't see it.

Outlook can also create aliases

Except you can't patent a thought. You can patent a process. Someone else can make something similar, as long as it does it a different way.
Otherwise no cell phone on the planet except 1 would have PIN unlock. No car except 1 would have 4 wheels, etc.

Not to be pedantic, but "core" LITERALLY means the center of something. They picked a shitty name if they really don't intend for it to be a reference implementation.

I work for a Credit Union that does not block crypto transactions as long as the business has an MSB number. It was a fight to get them to even agree to this much. I would encourage you to engage with a credit union, they are much more likely to listen to policy requests, or to waive the limit resets. All credit unions have AGMs and non-members can ask questions.
[Coinsquare]( has an MSB number. I haven't had any issues buying from them.

They don't actually have to though. The BDPL isn't law, and the contract Bitmain acquired previously is law. So they can continue to use it for as long as the contract was valid for.
However, once the contract is over, Little Dragon can force them to agree to the BDPL conditions before signing. If Bitmain agrees, it is then enforceable.
Also, this doesn't prevent Bitmain from developing their own version of AsicBoost and ignoring the whole BDPL altogether. Nor does it prevent them from acquiring Little Dragon and dropping out of the BDPL.

This post reads like a "The Donald" headline.
Do you understand anything about the economy? Food prices rise due to increases in population and a decrease in farmable land. Sure, inflation plays a role, but so do thousands of other components that result in the price you pay for food.
Pretty shitty example.
