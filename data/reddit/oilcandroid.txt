"I was a Republican when I realized only Republican leaders lean toward authoritarianism, while Democratic leaders don't."
LOOOOL.  I don't have any political affiliations, but you're going to have a funny look on your face when the 40,000 sealed federal indictments are released.
Thankfully, crypto will be a beacon in the storm.

Yeah, I don't see the bear market ending with an 8% pump over 30 minutes.  I think they're shaking more loose hands on the way down to 5k.  
Could always be wrong, but something about this seems very...off.

Right now, the market is dominated and manipulated by whales and any gains/losses you see day trading will be at the mercy of the the big fish.  This ain't the stock market.  It's the stock market on crack.  
It's like a racecar driver that has to lead their vision well ahead of where they actually are.  The real action in terms of accrued value will be 3 years down the line rather than 3 weeks.  Thus, the hodl mindset.  But hey, if you can make profits day trading, more power to you.
Edit:  Also, every coin currently rises and falls as Bitcoin rises and falls.  This could change, but for the time being, you're likely not going to catch a rising star and then be able to parlay that into another coin that's still below value.  Almost all coins rise and fall at the same time and at similar rates.  Maybe some day they will shift in value independently.

Translation:  "It will drop below YTD line again and we want you afraid.  Very afraid.  The weakness of your hands increases our purchasing power before we unleash the bull in the China shop."
