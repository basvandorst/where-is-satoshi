there is another site that went live recently, similar to ebay but using Bitcoin and a few other alts I think. Anyone remember what it is???
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:52:00
That's awesome...
Everyone should share...
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:35:36
Yea...of about 1%...
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:34:01
Tether has a total marketcap of about $2 Billion. Bitcoin is $200 Billion.
Even if EVERY SINGLE Tether is worthless it represents only 1% of Bitcoin value.

@_date: 2015-06-19 17:11:40
How cool...
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:42:27
From the article:
"Editor's Note: Bitcoin's value is directly determined by people will to accept it as payment. As such, the price of Bitcoin is inherently linked to supply and demand - when demand for Bitcoin increases, the price increases. Conversely, when demand decreases, Bitcoin's value falls. **This is what Matonis means when he suggests that Bitcoin is a consensus based currency.**"
Ummm...no it isn't...

@_date: 2018-05-13 19:55:19
I was thinking more along the lines of an algorithm or something that manipulates the price independently of what's actually happening in the market. 
Changes the price according to someone's agenda regardless of the actual buying and selling going on.
Like they enter a closing number for bitcoin on any particular day and that's what it fucking closes at... 
No matter what anyone does...

As long as "paper" bitcoin doesn't replace the actual bitcoin market.
Gold and silver ARE manipulated. The amount of AU and AG that are owned and traded on paper FAR exceeds the amount in actual supply.
If only a small percentage of AU/AG paper holders demanded ddelivery it would blow the markets completely apart and the value of AU/AG would skyrocket.
I don't want to see bitcoin fucked with in a similar way that would artificially keep the price down.

I will never use GreenWallet again. 2FA failed ON THEIR END after a new phone, new wallet, etc. was set up.
I followed all of the correct protocols for the reinstalling of everything including the original Google 2fa code.
Now I've got funds locked for 12 months until they unlock the 2fa...supposedly...
If you use GW and you activate 2fa, your funds are at great risk.
@_date: 2019-02-25 16:36:52
The gold price is artificially manipulated using paper "assets". IMO, this is not a valid comparison.
If everyone who owned gold on paper demanded delivery, the market would blow up...There isn't enough gold above ground to even begin to fill the demand if that were to happen.
The Gold Anti Trust Action Committee (GATA) has been documenting paper market manipulation of the gold markets now for decades.

I watch development. If development in the Bitcoin space continues at the current pace, there is no telling how high the price will go...
Still so few people even know about Bitcoin...price has all kinds of room on the upside...
there will always be dips but the only real threat I see is the potential for the wall street vampires to figure out a way to manipulate it thru paper the way they've done with Gold and Silver...

This is why all the bickering and bloodletting over block size and transaction times and miner fees means very little in the larger context.
The only people that care are the few hundred thousand who understand the tech.
There about 3 billion others who have been getting fucked by central banks, credit card companies, insurance conglomerates, taxation agencies, etc. as long as anyone can remember. Those people couldn't care less about a few dollars for a fee. Or a short wait for confirmations. They've been getting screwed WAY harder by traditional institutions.
They simply want a way out. So Bitcoin.
Then there are another 4 billion or so who just want access to the global marketplace but have no banking availability or credit and no way to get it.
They simply want a way in. So Bitcoin.
For those billions of people, fees, transaction times and block size debates will seem trivial.
Bitcoin is still real inexpensive...just wait til the wave gets rolling...
In statistical terms, essentially no one even knows about Bitcoin yet.
So HODL!!!

I opened a store and tried but so far it has to be run on a desktop, essentially, and one has to be online in order for your stuff to be visible to anyone else.
Until they get a mobile app and a set-up that does not require a constant live connection in order to be seen, i don't think it will be successful.
I'm an old man not a dev. I use ebay, even though I don't like it, because it simple and had a big userbase.
I hope OB can evolve and make it easy for someone like me.

After sucking it up, I was able to get an account set up at circle. 
You have to do ID verification, etc. but that's all good...they were quick about it.
Also, if you want to sell Bitcoin, you need to connect a bank account but if you only want to buy, a credit card is all you need.
So now I own approximately .23 Bitcoin!!!
Thanks again for all the advise...

Yea...I get their point...but it's not like we're remotely close to mining asteroids...

What exactly do you think they're going to "do" to the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:44:02
Yea...like DAO...
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:04:07
@_date: 2018-12-11 15:51:48
Great idea...
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:41:59
Actually, they won't give a shit...
Bitcoin IS digital gold. 
Gonna have to pay that premium...
That's the price of getting in early...still...and plenty of people will be happy to pay it...
Relatively speaking, no one even knows about Bitcoin.

I was thinking it might have been the fee...

I buy a lot of stuff from overstock using Bitcoin. Today I had my first real problem.
I made a purchase and made payment with BTC. I got the message above immediately after sending payment.
I'm confident they will refund the BTC payment but the most troubling thing about the whole experience was this:
I spoke with a customer service agent about the situation and she told me to contact Bitcoin...LOL...
But not really LOL...it's a bummer that one of the biggest retailers who accepts BTC has customer service people who don't even know what it is...
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:54:30
I agree...

"It hasn't been down for a single nanosecond in its 8 { years, and it is the largest computer network in history," Hileman said, adding that without any central control over the network, there is no possible single point of failure. "How many complicated IT systems, large IT systems had zero downtime over an 8 {-year period?"

Thanks a ton...super cool of you to do this for the community...
Cheers man!!!

I've considered this and would appreciate some more discussion about it. 
I'm a silver investor for years and know that the amount of silver being traded on paper and the amount of silver that exists above the ground are grossly out of sync. 
The price is held in check artificially thru paper. 
Of course if any large holders on paper ever demanded delivery...

I'm a buyer all day at $2500 but i dont think it'll make it that low...
@_date: 2018-12-18 14:44:40
Update: Refund received this morning after an email yesterday from a competent agent.
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:34:26
Awesome...thanks for sharing...
@_date: 2016-07-13 14:04:06
Well, the transaction went thru. It was confirmed yesterday evening.
I've no idea why it took so long but it's cool now. 
Perhaps the low fee i paid just made the xaction take that much longer.
Anyhow thanks for all the help...

Another reason why we are not even close to a bubble...
So few even know about Bitcoin, relatively speaking, much less understand it...
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:09:20
Yea, I htink that's what's going on. I'm updating my core wallet which was behind and hopefully the Ƀ will show back up and I can resend with the proper fee.
Thanks guys...

The scaling debate is primarily for tech-heads...
Nobody else gives a shit about transaction fees or confirmation times...
They just want in...
Those of us who remember super low transaction fees and lightning fast confirmations are just spoiled.
The tech will come along...
Bitcoin is still miles ahead and magnitudes better than anything most people are used to...
