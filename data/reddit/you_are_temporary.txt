I thought coins were only given away on a regular time scale? Why are a lot being mined within minutes of each other?

This really highlights a serious issue with the whole idea of Bitcoin, which is praised as a means of owning and transferring your money without needing a third party.  
If the incentive of Bitcoin is owning and sending money without the need for a possibly corruptible / untrustworthy third party (i.e. a bank), but the everyday person won't adopt the relatively complex technology without the  a third party wrapping it up and making it "safe" and easy to use, what's the whole point?  
Places like Circle and Coinbase are making Bitcoin easy to own and use (and therefore provide a smaller barrier for entry to the ecosystem), but THEY ARE THIRD PARTIES.  
To me, it seems like they will eventually take the exact same role as banks, effectively rendering the whole concept of a currency that you use without involving a third party totally null except for the small subset of technology enthusiasts that are willing and able to manage their Bitcoins themselves. 
Instead of trusting a bank, I have to trust Coinbase.  It doesn't really amount to a "decentralized currency," the single point of failure just shifts to a different third party.

What's the average person's incentive for using bitcoin to pay for things other than stuff they're embarrassed or not allowed to buy with regular payment systems? do places like overstock offer discounts for purchasing with Bitcoin? I don't think a single app will make or break mainstream adoption right now. Bitcoin seems a bit like a solution in search of a problem at the moment

According to whom? The only reason banks can lend money is because people store their money with banks. 
Edit: here is a quote from the International Monetary Fund's website: "Although banks do many things, their primary role is to take in funds—called deposits—from those with money, pool them, and lend them to those who need funds."

Dude, it is obvious from your post that you're suffering from one if not several mental conditions.

What about those who don't provide those type of services? In terms of being paid in bitcoin by your legitimate employer, this begs the question, first, of how many of these employers are actually willing to do this.  Second, how many people are actually willing to accept it.  
Personally I just don't think it'll happen any time in the near future.

@_date: 2014-11-29 18:48:25
Posted about this long ago.  Many people think that systems like coinbase, bitpay, circle, and others who provide a similar service will increase adoption of Bitcoin. While this may be true, they neglect to see where this is leading - centralization. Literally the opposite of one of the main reasons Bitcoin was revolutionary in the first place.  
It reminds me of that hippy south park episode. "Fuck modern society, man. We can start our own community where we have a dude, who like, bakes bread, and a dude who protects the other people." 
"You mean like a baker, and a cop?"
Eerily similar to:
"Fuck the banks man. I shouldn't have to trust a third party with my money. We can start our own system, where someone like, takes care of all the shitty details of securing my money, and then makes it easy for me to just put it in and take it out. It's revolutionary, man."
"....you mean like a bank?"
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:38:54
Ok, credit cards are susceptible to fraud.  I can see their next question - how do I get bitcoins?
- Well, you can sign up on an exchange and buy them.
"What does that entail?"
- Well, you have to give someone your bank account information so they can charge you.  Or you can give them your credit card.
So, we've arrived at a conundrum.  I have to trust a corporation with sensitive financial information regardless.  I suppose you can view that as 1 corporation instead of multiple, but the point is diminished.  What's to keep someone from hacking Coinbase instead of Target?  The other option is buying bitcoins in person, which is a huge hassle.  I really don't think we'll see mass adoption (at least in older generations) for a long time.  Price rises with demand, and the demand that would be required to see the price go up to something like $50k would have to be insane.  Possible, but not any time soon

His remarks about Bitcoin are from an investing perspective.  It doesn't mean that he believes the technology isn't useful, just that he doesn't recommend it as an investment vehicle.

@_date: 2014-11-29 21:54:03
Sure, the issue of "banks' primary function" is debatable, and also beside the point of my initial post. What isn't debatable is that banks store people's money. They provide people with a service, so that people have less to worry about in their daily lives. This is the exact same function of services like Coinbase. Instead of trusting a bank with my money, I have to trust Coinbase. 
In the realm of personal asset security for the general population, Bitcoin has not eliminated the necessity of third parties.

If there's something you could do to speed the process up I would very much appreciate it, but until my problem is solved your words mean literally nothing. 
Twice now I've started dialogues with the company, gotten to the point in the conversation where the only logical response on your part is to send a replacement check, and twice now the dialogue has stopped immediately once it reached this point.  Your company has no problem responding to me when all they do is ask for my address and give me my packages tracking number, but once I explain that the tracking number shows I never received my package, YOU IGNORE ME.  No matter how many times I update my ticket. It happened yesterday, and again THREE FULL WEEKS AGO. 
I even managed to find the "Live" help open one day which I mistakenly believed would help solve my problem once and for all since I assumed I would be talking with a real person. Turns out, all the live chat support is good for is telling you that someone will respond to your regular ticket ASAP...aka, nothing. 
Your mail system is automated? Shouldn't that make it *easier* to send a replacement check?  
You want to act like your company has good customer service? Write a check, put it in an envelope with MY address on it, put a stamp on it and drop it in the mail like you should have done two months ago. Until that is done, save your breath. Because your words mean nothing to me or anyone else your company is mistreating.

I have a hard time understanding what would drive the price of Bitcoins up.  Why would the average american need to use them?  I love their novelty and the intricacies of their implementation...but I'm not sure how I could convince anyone over the age of 40 to use them (unless they're just interested in the technology itself). Can anyone explain?

What is your business?
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:11:31
I understand your perspective and appreciate your concern.  CampBX differs from the other exchanges you've listed (BFL, a hardware company, is in a different category) in that is is based in and run out of the United States of America, in the State of Georgia.  Mt. Gox, Neo and Bee, and Bitcoinica are all based outside of the United States, making efforts to pursue action within the American justice system incredibly difficult.  This is not the case for CampBX.  
Money returned or not, the people in charge of this company (should they be found to have engaged in illegal activity) will not enjoy the same blanket of international protection that the other exchanges share.  
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:15:00
Warned or not, it doesn't mean what they've done is legal.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:51:43
Because many of the time frames are such that a very slight change in the start date would result in a drastically different outcome as to whether the bitcoin price is up or down. It's manipulating the boundaries of something (political regions, dates) to change the outcome of a certain measurement of something that depends on those boundaries. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 05:05:41
Such a strange situation.  They don't seem to be an intentionally malicious company, but then again I suppose they can fuck people over big time regardless of whether it's intentional or not.  When did you submit your first ticket? 
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:27:06
I've most definitely looked for similar experiences.  
(Edit, let me rephrase):  Should it come to pass that the company has taken customers money and removed all means of retrieving it, I beg to differ that legality has nothing to do with it.

His argument boils down to - "restrictions and new regulations will be imposed and prices will plummet."  However, he also hints that he thinks Litecoin could take it's place?  What on Earth could possibly lead to Bitcoin being regulated into the dirt while Litecoin would get by unscathed?

How could they possibly be offering an online cold storage service? Doesn't that violate, like, the only benefit of cold storage itself? I was under the impression that the main point of cold storage was keeping your shit as far away from the internet as possible.

Good thoughts.  
Something interesting I heard recently was a comparison between Bitcoins and the California Gold Rush.  Not many people struck it rich during the Gold Rush, and those that did were mainly just incredibly lucky.  
The people who really succeeded were the entrepreneurs selling these miners their food, jeans, boots, and tools.  It's the very same idea here.

I'm not going to argue over the assumptions you've made in your post.

@_date: 2013-12-19 00:19:21
Well the price moving in a certain direction could be good or bad depending on whether you currently own Bitcoin or not. So people in different positions could simultaneously be in a good or bad position when the price is changing.
