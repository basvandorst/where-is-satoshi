The only thing that needs additional adoption is merchants offering sending the Transactions for their customers. If this gets traction, you can just pay without having to carry around your own Internet capable device.

Don't know much about Cambodia, but India is not a very friendly place, as far as Bitcoins are concerned. The current Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (Raghuram Rajan) is fiercely anti-Bitcoin.

I think the CEO is saying they are thinking about implementing bitcoin because they want to erase their negative publicity and anger from their customers over them (ebay/paypal) banning bitcoin. They wont be implementing it unless its kicking and screaming.

If they do implement bitcoin
I see paypal as the middle man still (abitrator) in a bitcoin transaction
They can still screw you over
