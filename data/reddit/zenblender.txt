Your English is fine, it's just one of those silly phrases I have been seeing lately.  Not sure why the analogy of a "rising" meteor exists...
@_date: 2013-03-27 15:03:36
True dat.  It'll be hard for the government to compete with bitcoin's exponential rise while they paralyze themselves with years of indecision and partisanship.  We just need to make sure it is able to bridge the gap from "enthusiasts" to "everyday people".

Well, my point is that the *average*, blindly patriotic citizen will not join you in the assertion that a currency "must be de-centralized to be trustworthy".  It takes an awful lot of explaining to someone who isn't familiar with the inner workings of bitcoin to get across WHY this is true.  Before you finish your speech to them, they will cut you off and say *"Nah, I'm gonna use what Uncle Sam says is good, I've always trusted them.  You want me to learn about Bitcoin?  Ain't nobody got time for that!"*
Also, remember there are varying degrees of trust.  While average citizens may understand that printing money indefinitely and out-of-control inflation is a bad thing, they still trust the government "enough" to stick with whatever they are offering -- because hey, it's easy and most people are too lazy to think for themselves.

Thanks.  Our major challenge in the bitcoin ecosystem is that any time you mention "poker" and "bitcoin" in the same sentence, everyone assumes it is a real-money gambling casino.  It's hard to convey that there are other business models for poker, with other reasons to play.  There are lots of poker games that are closer in model to ours, most of them are on iOS devices and Facebook.  Your chosen platform and e-commerce system has a lot to do with players' expectations...

Good question, and I'm not surprised it came up.  Basically, my game is similar to "freemium" models you see on Facebook and iOS.  You can play the game for free, but if you want the full game experience, you can spend money.  You can buy our in-game currency called Jacks, and more chips to play with, if you choose.  You can use Jacks on various "bombs" and "charms" you can use on other players, social features like clans and friends lists, leveling up, etc.  We have something called "power player" which is something you can buy with Jacks that unlocks a lot of fun stuff.  Anyway, you can now use bitcoin in addition to other, more traditional payment methods.

I don't see how the car analogy makes sense.  We are talking about a new form of currency.  The NUMBER ONE most important detail to the user is "How much of it do I have?"  If you look at my address and see one number and I look at my wallet and see another, I think that will confuse some people.  Understanding the concept of a bitcoin address's balance should not require an understanding of how it handles multiple outputs and change addresses.  We need to make bitcoin appeal to EVERYDAY PEOPLE, not enthusiasts like us.
I can drive a car without knowing how spark plugs and fuel injectors work, but from the user's perspective, that's not the NUMBER ONE most important detail of the thing.  The most important detail is whether the big hunk of metal moves forward when I mash on a pedal.  If you built a car that will confuse people UNTIL they have an understanding of the complexities under the hood, you'll have a much harder time getting people to adopt the technology en masse.

This is kind of what I was thinking.  Some addresses for taxation, etc could be hard-coded into the system.  It might retain the pseudo-anonymity of bitcoin (a major selling point) but have mandatory taxation built-in pretty easily.

My social (non-gambling) poker site now accepts bitcoin: 
I decided to use BitPay to make things easier and more secure for me, but in the future (or other projects) I might implement bitcoin directly rather than use a middleman.  BitPay was easy to set up and the fees are low.

Here's the deal.  The posts are all honest posts from our users.  Are they Redditors?  No, but I didn't tell them to comment, and I didn't tell them what to say, and I sure didn't PAY them to do so.  We have a lot of loyal, long term players on Triplejack, and I mentioned the addition of bitcoin to our e-commerce system.  Most of them were totally unfamiliar with it, so I pointed them to and showed them the post I made here.  That's all I did!  I know that it looks staged, but it's not.  Our users actually care enough about the game to help promote it.  I didn't know they were going to post anything, and was surprised to see it.  Sorry to have offended you so terribly.

None of them are employees of mine and I didn't pay them to post.  The posts are genuine.  No need to be such an asshole to me.

Quantum computing is one example of a way in which the cryptography could potentially be compromised.  Even the page on bitcoin.org about the subject ( is a bit ambiguous and does not rule out that quantum computers are a risk to bitcoin.  Instead of saying that bitcoin is immune, the page is merely pointing out that current quantum computers are not a threat, but that banks are also at risk.
I'm also curious if some as-yet-unknown exploit is discovered.  Would that necessarily mean the end of bitcoin?  Without a central control organization, it may be difficult to implement a major change.  Since we don't yet know what kinds of clever exploits might be invented, we don't know how easy or hard it might be to fix it.
While decentralization is a good attribute of bitcoin, it might be nice to have one central authority on the code and the cryptography.  It seems there is a lot of arguing regarding certain decisions that need to be made.  Hopefully a good system of moderation will evolve.

Don't you think it already requires a lot of "reading and learning" for newbies?  I'm wondering, if you were to introduce a friend or family member to bitcoin, how concisely can you explain bitcoin to them?  In my experience, they either lose interest before they even understand the basics, or it turns into a very long, detailed explanation.  All I'm saying is that bitcoin needs to be simpler and understandable at a glance for it to really take off.  This is one example of a confusing feature that could be simplified, or more clearly explained.  Just thinking about the big picture here ;)

I would guess that the government's version of bitcoin could still be billed as "de-centralized" while still maintaining control.  They would easily have the resources to maintain the entire blockchain with government computers/miners spread across the country.  In other words, they might structure it such that people could not freely enter the mining/verification side of the equation, and thus a 51% attack is not possible.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:22:35
LOL.  I understand bitcoin.  Read my original post.  This is a *hypothetical* situation.  Nobody here is advocating adding tax into bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:01:36
Ah, thank you!  I learned something today, so now I can go back to bed!

Hmm.  What's the default behavior of blockchain.info wallets?  If it uses change addresses, some users might bookmark their own address info link, but if they happen to not be logged in when they view it, it could show the "wrong" balance.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:27:52
I wonder how, hypothetically, a government would create something like bitcoin.  Would it be inspired by bitcoin (heck, even derived from it), and have maybe 50% in common with it, or would it be a 100% different sort of animal?
I agree that they would try to maximize control over it, but creating something entirely different probably means it would never see the light of day (we all know how long it takes gov't to do things, especially "from scratch").  However, if they essentially made a fork of bitcoin and put in a few key changes, it might be more likely to happen.

Interesting!  I will read up on it, I hadn't heard of this...

Thanks for admitting that you are an asshole, because I was starting to think the Internet was running low on those!  (Cancel the alarm, guys)
Please, do something with that oh-so-scandalous screenshot of yours, it makes me smile to think that you actually have nothing better to do with your life!  :)  Better call the Reddit police on me!  Code red!  OMG!
Oh hey, I think there's another thread that needs some hate spewed all over it -- chop chop!  You've got work to do, son!  ;)
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:12:55
Wow, this sucks.  I also decided they were reliable and the best way to get BTC quickly.  I mean, they would send me a text that the bitcoins were being credited to me before I even left the Moneygram location!  So fast... now what do I use??
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:04:05
Look at the amazing technological advances we've seen in just the last 100 years.  While quantum computers are technically very difficult to build, and are progressing slowly, are you so sure that it won't become an issue until the "end of the world"?
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:35:19
That's so meta.
