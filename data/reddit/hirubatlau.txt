You have it backwards. Regulation can only prevent blacklisted coins entering the white market, it has no power to stop whitelisted coins being sent out to unregulated addresses as long as you control your own keys. 
In any case, a blacklist/whitelist system is only coherent on the UTXO level, not the address level (imagine you hold 100 bitcoins in a squeaky clean whitelisted address, to which a malicious actor sends a few satoshis of unsolicited drug money from a blacklisted address).
Assuming for a moment that the government is even capable of maintaining a public whitelist of KYC-ed UTXOs, they must then decide on a system for propagating whitelist status to subsequent transactions.
They can either adopt a "one drop rule": that any UTXO that derives in any part from a blacklisted transaction, no matter how remotely, is itself blacklisted. That means no coinjoins, no mixers, and no cross-border payments of any kind. This scenario is tantamount to banning bitcoin.
Alternatively, they could set a 'whiteness threshold', such that UTXOs are allowed a certain percentage of tainted inputs without themselves being blacklisted. This approach is ineffective to the point of uselessness, because now dirty coins can be predictably laundered at zero risk by simply mixing the tainted value into enough clean transactions.

Just the network transaction fee, currently averaging about $1 for confirmation in the next block or a fraction of that if you don't mind waiting a few hours.

Somehow I don't believe gold is trading at $1500/oz because of its potential as a material for plumbing fixtures. 
How about the value of USD? The only enjoyable physical items you can realistically make out of dollar bills are origami cranes, kindling and toilet paper. Plus only a small fraction of the supply of USD is actually in the form of physical cash.

How do you acquire fiat currency?
You get paid in it, you sell or trade things for it, friends and family send it to you as gifts or remittances.

Actually yes.
Commercial ice cream contains gelatin as a stabilizer. Gelatin is normally derived from the skin, bones and hooves of pigs or cows, but due to religious dietary restrictions is sometimes produced instead from poultry by-products including chicken beaks.

The canonical chain is the one with the most "chainwork" - that's the expected number of hashes performed to produce the entire chain.
So yes, the network chooses the "most work" chain. This is more secure than simply using the longest chain, because a malicious node could produce an arbitrarily long chain by faking block timestamps in order to keep the difficulty extremely low.
Chainwork on the other hand is an unforgeable proof of the total effort expended to mine a chain.
This also protects against attacks on old transactions, since the chainwork measure means that rewriting N blocks of history requires producing N+1 times as much chainwork as the rest of the network combined. After several confirmations, even an attacker with significantly more than 51% hash power would not be able to revert a transaction in a reasonable amount of time.

Great summary!

What you call 'hoarding' we used to call 'saving'.
Time pressure due to inflation encourages faster spending which tends towards less optimal purchases, leaving less spending power for when better options later become available. 
Without inflation, consumers can wait for better spending opportunities to emerge without being penalised, which leads to a more efficient allocation of capital.
It's the difference between encouraging paying for your kid's college tuition (high value, only purchasable X years in the future) and encouraging blowing a potential college fund on hookers and cocaine (lower value, but immediately available).

Do you think bitcoin has any intrinsic value as an immutable, permissionless, trustless ledger? Are there any direct industrial/commercial uses for those features?

Inflation by what measure? Yes, the reported official CPI averages a little under 2% the past decade, but the CPI is a measure of cost of living and consumer behaviour, not inflation. As a proxy for inflation, it is severely confounded by productivity growth and technological progress among other factors.
A more direct measure of inflation would be something like the M2 total money supply. By that metric, annual inflation averaged almost 6% over the same period. 
In any case, who says 2% inflation isn't significant? At that rate your purchasing power drops 50% every 35 years. Meaning every dollar you save at the start of your career loses half its value by the time you retire.

1. Go to the [lntipbot wiki page]( and copy the node address, including the IP and port number at the end, e.g: `0219c2f8818bd2124dcc41827b726fd486c13cdfb6edf4e1458194663fb07891c7
2. Open Eclair and go to 'channels' and tap the green '+' button at the bottom.
3. Select "PASTE A NODE URI" and open the channel.
You might need to check the "request liquidity" box if you only want to withdraw.
Remember you don't actually need to connect directly to the tipbot node, you can also just open a channel with one of the random ACINQ nodes and transactions will be automatically routed through the Lightning network.

I haven't reviewed the proposal in much depth, but vault schemes typically protect against direct theft at the expense of creating a new vulnerability to ransom attacks.
In Möser-Eyal-Sirer vaults, if an attacker compromises either the vault key or the recovery key, they can trap your funds in the vault indefinitely and demand a ransom to allow you to get them out.
Bishop's new scheme looks better, as recovery depends on a chain of multiple pre-signed delete-the-key re-vaulting transactions instead of a single recovery key, but at first glance it seems like the same ransom attack is possible if the pre-signed transactions are compromised.

Spending now comes at the expense of spending later, so stimulating spending effectively just front-loads economic activity (one reason why democratic governments love stimulus packages - they're only interested in the next 4-5 years).
Whether that's good or bad depends what you want to achieve. If the economy is on the brink of a downturn, it might be worth stimulating some extra short-term spending to stave it off. But if the economy is doing ok, it might be better to prioritize the longer term growth that savings fuel.

Great idea! Although you might want to double-check your data.
E.g. I was very surprised to see the Dominican Republic with almost the same market cap as Spain (a much larger and wealthier country).
Turns out that the DR does have a circulating money supply of ~1.4t units, but that's 1.4t *Dominican Pesos*, not US Dollars, and so their market cap is actually ~50x lower than listed.

No problem.
The only other entry that's immediately suspect is Venezuela.
It looks like you're using the TradingEconomics M3 supply estimate for the Bolívar Fuerte (VEF) together with the "official" pegged rate of 10 VEF : 1 USD.
Two problems with that:
a) since August 2018 Venezuela's official currency is now the Bolívar Soberano (VES), and I can't find any reliable money supply estimates for this new currency.
and b) before the changeover, as far as I can make out, the old currency was trading on the open market closer to 250,000 VEF : 1 USD. Alternatively, considering the VES replaced the VEF at a rate of 100,000:1, and now trades at ~6,800 VES : 1 USD, that would imply a present day value of 680m VEF per USD.
Fuck knows what you do with all of that.

Download any lightning wallet, open a channel, request a withdrawal from the tip bot via PM. (instructions linked in the comment below)
The tip bot itself also works as a simple custodial lighting wallet: you can pay lightning invoices directly from your tips balance via PM using the same !withdraw command.
