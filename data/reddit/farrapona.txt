I don't see how its a protection against inflation because it is not a currency and it is not a store of value as it is constructed/used today.
You can use it for speculation or as a medium of exchange, but if there is inflation in the USD that will be reflected in BTC also.
If the price of a hyundai goes from 17K to 20K because of inflation, the seller is going to want 1.2 BTC, not 1 BTC for the same hyundai.  At this point there is no intrinsic value in BTC
As long as the only way to measure the value of BTC is in some other currency, it is NOT an inflation hedge.  In venezeula its is used as an inflation hedge because its value is measured against the USD, not the bolivar.
I dont get the point of your 2nd paragarph.  Debt is debt, saving is saving whether its USD EUR or BTC
And yeah bitcoin promotes saving cuz its impossible to spend ;-P

I'm sure it's a great phone but careful, apps look way shittier on Android than iPhone if u care about design/appearance. I just got a s7 after 2 years of iPhone.

So just screwing around, i bought $5 of BTC on coinbase because i am trying to learn about it.
If I want to move it to a wallet, right now they want $21 transaction fee.....
Is this the fee everywhere on the network for all transactions?
Coinbase says they don't make money on this, the transaction fee is what the miners are paid.  I don't totally believe this but this is a crazy high fee.
I doubt you are paying $20 each time u use BTC.  Is this because the network is busy?  Are all transactions expensive at this time for this reason or is it just a coinbase thing.
What if i had BTC on my wallet and wanted to send some to someone else's wallet.  Fees still crazy high?

What incentives are there really to use bitcoin in a developed economy?
Maybe a regulated govt backed version ok , but as it stands today?
Its a crazy hassle to get setup.  People on this board are tech inclined but think of all the people you know.  Most of them would have a hard time setting up a wallet, buying bitcoin and then securing everything.
My mom has to change her email username every few months cuz she gets locked out and says fuckit and adds 2017 or whatever to her address lol
Please educate me because i see NO BENEFIT in using bitcoin except speculating it goes up in price, novelty/curiousity and anonymity.
Or if you are a doomer with a bomb shelter n backyard and think hyperinflation is coming.
Its expensive!!! Fees etc..
Banking in developed world is cheap/free, secure, super convienent, guaranteed by govt and institiution.
Lose your bank card or get scammed, no worries, you get your money back.
I think eventually we will use some regulated version.
Love to hear more in this discussion.  I am considering buying some but really trying hard to understand real world benefits of this long term.
Think its a bubble totally overvalued and will crash hard from todays price.
But at same time am greedy like a human and want in a bit in case it goes to a million like some assholes on tv say

I am going to checkout GDAX but am sceptical about the fees (i am in canada)
Coinbase to me is a joke (maybe because i dont have enough info)
I can only buy $250 this week on coinbase.
And it costs $10
And its not really anonymous - they can provide my info to govt authorities it seems
I heard they are planning an IPO, probably a big pump and dump for owners.
On the other hand the $250 limit perhaps stopped me from doing something really dumb this week ;-P
I think you are overestimating the tech savvy of 17 and 18 year olds.  They know how to make emojis on iphones and open apps but i almost think they are less tech savvy than people 10 years ago because the tech companies are so good at making things 'easy'

genuinely curious, what do you do with btc daily?
What vendors are you using on such a regular basis?
To buy groceries/coffee/entertainment or what?
Or do you use it as a barter for 1 to 1 exchanges?
There is a big list of companies that take it that i saw somewhere but still seems pretty fringe.
I doubt i could use it in my town to buy gas, food, clothes or whatever.

Ordinary people don't care because electronic money (visa/debit/online shopping) is perfectly good, in fact better than crypto for people holding 99% of worlds wealth. Bitcoin is only better if u live in some hyperinflation country (aka the loser countries) or want to send remittances, say foreign labourer sending money back home but even that is risky with volatility

Oh God I have been pending with quad for like a week
