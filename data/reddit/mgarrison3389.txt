Mining Bitcoin on general equipment is dead... But no need to be an ass about it. Yes you could mine a bunch of different coins with your equipment. Check out whattomine.com and enter your specific equipment and you can see what kind of money you will make! Also if you make an account at nicehash it will mine whatever is most profitable and pay you in Bitcoin! And to answer your original question, I'm sure you can make a script to start the miner st certain times. I couldn't tell you where to start with that one though!

Most of the stories you are reading are made up. That guy earlier did not find 250 million that he just forgot about

It's funny because Bitcoin is volatile.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:57:26

Currently, I am waiting nervously to get my bitcoin/nano back from a recently hacked exchange. (Bitgrail) :( Things are not looking too good at the moment.

Lol. Basically said "we don't know if any of this is accurate. You can look it up yourself"
@_date: 2018-07-16 15:20:28
How much of a fee did you pay?
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:21:47
Wtf? I didn't know this was possible

I mean yeah it is eating alts, and people are swarming to Bitcoin. I mean Bitcoin is at an ath, but it is something to really be that excited about? People are buying up Bitcoin at the moment, only in hopes of gaining free money via hardforked coin
