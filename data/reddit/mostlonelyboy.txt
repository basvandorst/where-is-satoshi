You can't beat the whales, but sometimes you can be that small fish taking advantage of their movements: 
Said that safest (and then slowest) way to make profit daytrading is arbitrage. Increasing my BTC of 0.015 per day, keeping my altcoins always at the same amounts.

I can see around 2022 all pussy countries like usa, european countries and some other will ban bitcoin because it will destroy their bank economy. That day, all of us, we will move to a bitcoin based Japan living the dream spending our coins. We are lucky. Japan is cool.

Yeah HODL is not always the best solution. SPEDN!(spend) is the best one. Not selling everything at once but use your bitcoins when you need.
If you crash tomorrow with your car all your thousands or bitcoin worths nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:23:17
Take those magic money and go to have a nice holiday with your wife in a nice place and love each other a lot.
Only HODL paying back a lot. But why being happy to earn money that we never spend? you don't know future, enjoy life now, tomorrow you never know.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:42:53
If it's the 10% of what you own go for it. Is it half, think a lot: you have kids? You have family? You have debts?
If its more than half be awared you can lose it And your life will be fucked up.

mbtc it will be fine. When you buy a soda you are fine saying it's 300 ml. Nobody talking about 0,3 liters.
As you say 3cm, not 0,03 m or 0,000003 Km
that's why actually scales were invented.
People got easily used to byte, Kilobyte, megabyte, terabyte  as long the basic capacity grown, it will be easy for bitcoin too.
So get ready for talking about millibits.

And the percentage has to grow, and is a good thing. I don't know how many people spending dollars actually knows all the economics and the process to get the value behind it. Bitcoin is a currency, so a mass product, so no needed to be understood deep. Sad but true.

Just not going all in. I bought  10 Bitcoins when it was 450 dollars, sold some to pay some sudden expenses during the years, end up with 3 right now. Getting good profit, 1/3 of what i would had just hodling, but my past one didn't have a clue about this happening, so honestly i don't regret.

People are lazy ( i mean the mass), they will stay with the most easy to use and most accepted one, and that will probably be Bitcoin.
There are tenth of better social networks compared to facebook in terms of privacy, data use, charitable profits, some better feature, but guess what... people are lazy. So is some crypto will overcome Bitcoin, it has to do it very fast and very soon. Otherwise even if they are technically better they won't never be the One.

I am not a tech and I'm not even sure if i understood right about blockchain, nods, fee etc. etc. etc. But on my ignorant  eyes every fork bring free money... I was skeptical with bth when they explained to me, how is possible generate value (and own part of it) from nothing? But it happened. 
So why don't keep forking every month generating all this coins to sell for buy more bitcoin, pump the value of BTC waiting for the next fork and repeat the process? I know in tech  reality this can be very wrong and does't make sense. But it's what actually happening since this summer.

@_date: 2017-10-21 11:13:45
Yeah I know. But you generate (and own) something to sell from like nothing. Even if it reach the minimum and people will buy it just because "i invest just a couple of dollars who knows maybe i go lambo in the future" they are still money from nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:38:22
I think you are missing the point he is doing all of this to get more money. We are not talking about somebody selling his house and going to Africa fighting AIDS and save people. He gambling his money for money, probably to buy a bigger house and don't work anymore. I think we have a different vision of what materialistic means. And again I don't give a shit of what he's doing, I have been homeless and traveled for long time of my life and I am still paying for some risk i took. But it was my life. Having kids is another pair of shoes. If I lose everything now as i did before and i see my kids living in a fucking tent I will feel ashamed. We are not talking of sombody that has nothing and risk it for a better future. He has a good present risking for greedy.

Mmmm i guess caribbiean or pacific small island countries are actually the most possible to switch completely on BTC (or any crypto) they won't have anymore the costs of having a useless currency or using another currency like dollars and they will just need a phone and a internet connection. Way less complicate and expensive system that credit card POS.

Are we really discussing about this? People are investing in BTC in order to be lucky enough to BUY that kind of house.This guy is doing the opposite... why? Because is just greedy. And that it's fine if it was only his life. But it's putting on the table other people lives. When you have kids the first priority is protect them and give them a future. He is gambling with it just to double. Even if BTC reach 10k tomorrow, he's doing the wrong thing in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-09 17:30:06
Bitcoin will never reach 0,000000000000000 so you will never lose everything.

Well every alt coin has a market cap, look at that.
Bitcoin also started worthing cents and now are 5k. With the biggest market cap, so they are the ones that did better than anyone so far. 
I f you want to talk about small windows of time for easy earning yes, some did better, but they lost that value afterwards. I guess market caps is what you have to look to define who is winning this game. 
Things can change in future of course.

Do you have kids btw? 
Anyway, anyone is free to take his decisions. We are also talking about nothing since the house is still unsold. I am just saying in my life after having kids they become the reason why i work and why I am not taking useless risks as before. Everybody can be parent as they want. Hope for him (and for me) BTC will still raise a lot. This is not a parenting subr so i will stop it :)
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:00:51
And this just sum how not very smart this guy is: “Education is the best for the kids. If you raise your kids to be too materialistic, it is not good. And that was what we were doing, to be honest.” 
So why he's investing everything in BTC? To gain Love and the Peace in the World? He's doing one of the most materialistic thing he can do.
"And if things go wrong? “Then we will be without money for a moment. But I don’t think that that’s the worst thing that can happen in life.”
So why are you trying to get billions investing in BTC? Just live with what you have.
