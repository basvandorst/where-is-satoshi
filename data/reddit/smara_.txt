Way to go, man, save us a piece of that reddit cake!

Fake news.

Good luck! When does the broadcast start?

Thank you, fingers crossed, I'll be watching!

So, after making a shedload of money off of obvious scams, they decide to pull the plug on all cryptocurrency-related ads. Do they at least offer advertisers the possibility to get certified?

"Why was Musk holding the book?" Lol. Is this website for real?

This from the same guy who said he wasn't comfortable with bitcoin, but if we went into the future and bitcoin was successful, he would be able to explain why.

Sorry, you've lost me at spiritual guru. All of a sudden, everyone has something to say about cryptocurrencies.

Of course they have. However, they do invest in virtually everything.

I had no idea you guys have it so rough in the US. I can only imagine that NYU is great, but those costs are still prohibitive. I'm studying in the UK at a university that is ranked 1st in the country overall and top 5 in the world for my major. My full four-year tuition is less than this guy has to pay for one year with the NYU. I'm hodling my bitcoin, but I've used my trx profits (got very lucky there) to pay for tuition and other expenses.

Sorry to have to do this, but since you're trying to run a news website over there, you should probably learn the difference between its and it's.

You've gotta be kidding me.

I was actually referring to Cambridge. I know there's the big Oxbridge rivalry, but I don't think there's any significant difference between the two.

Enjoyed this a lot, thanks!
