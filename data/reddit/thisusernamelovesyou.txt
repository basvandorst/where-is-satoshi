Bfx stole 70m for themselves, are chilling with the cash, and are now going to use this scammy coin to manipulate prices and buy back their debt super cheap. They can then legally return to business and nobody will be any wiser.

Please, I need this XD I'll spend it wisely.

I'm really glad you guys are owning up for your mistake instead of trying to keep quiet :) Good on you.
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:34:25
In the long term, none of this matters. The fundamentals of what Bitcoin as a whole greatly outweigh the short term scaling dilemnas, and you will dearly regret selling. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 12:29:43
How very noble.

What if both live, but the price of one token crashes to $50-100 on both chains? That would be a shame as billions of dollars of wealth would be destroyed.
@_date: 2017-02-05 12:35:29
My very first bitcoin purchase was around $50. Wish I had bought more that low.
@_date: 2017-02-05 00:10:38
I believe that both ETH chains will survive (and thrive), but Bitcoin is different: it is much bigger, and public opinion matters. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:46:43
SegWit is a safe and easily implementable upgrade that has been thoroughly vetted and tested: it is a great way to increase capacity and reduce fees without increasing centralization. 
Granted, larger blocks are needed, but now is not the time - plus, the BU team has proven its incompetency time and time again. Let's get SegWit first before we increase the blocksize. 
I understand that value is not important, but, in the eye of the average investor and layman, it is. What brings more credibility to Bitcoin: "Bitcoin breaks all time high and reaches $2000", or "Bitcoin crashes yet again to $200"? That image of Bitcoin being a pump and dump will be reinforced and long term adoption will be hurt.

No, you can't. To send a bitcoin transaction you need some numbers and an internet connection - with those two things you can broadcast a spend on the bitcoin network.
To ban Bitcoin, they'll need to ban the Internet.

Fuming with anger, Roger logged onto Tor and began spamming his contact. "Hey", he typed at an impossibly fast speed, "I need you to get someone's info for me *right now*. The guy's name is Theymos, and I'm sending you his IP address. Get me everything you can -- full name, address, favourite ice cream flavour, everything. This is urgent."
He sat back in his seat, his heart pounding heavily in his chest. Bitcoin was meant to be free, and was to be associated with a free market: why the hell was someone trying to regulate each and every aspect of it so heavily? Such censorship would be detrimental to the ecosystem, and he would *not* let it happen - not on his watch. Roger checked the price ticker on -- yep, the price had gone up another 5%. Just another day. 
The sharp, ringing notification sound startled him. He quickly opened Tor, and sure enough, he had a response. Roger smiled. This information was gold -- time to post it on Reddit and completely ruin Theymos.
**1 week later**
The night was dark, starless and silent. Donned in black clothing and a ski mask, Roger thought back on the events of the past few days. He, the great MemoryDealers, had been banned on Reddit - how? All he had done was post the name and address of that wretch Theymos... That horrible, SegWit loving small-blocker. Now, it was time for him to pay.  He'd already gotten Theymos's address, and now here he was, right under his apartment block. Roger grinned - it was a smile of pure evil; he hadn't smiled like this since BU support hit an all time high.
Roger unzipped his dark grey back with a satisfying *zip* and pulled out his beloved grappling hook gun. He aimed it at the window of the fifth floor - where Theymos would undoubtedly be sleeping. He pushed hard on the trigger, and with a loud *click* the hook went flying through the air right into Theymos's window, latching itself onto the window ledge with a satisfying *clang*. He tugged on the rope - yep, it was taut and would hold his weight. With a grunt, he grabbed onto the rope and began pulling himself upwards.
His feet softly thudded onto the floor of Theymos's carpeted bedroom. He could vaguely make out its shape in the darkness - it was a gigantic room with a beautiful five monitor setup and a TV opposite the large bed. Roger stepped closer to the bed where he saw a figure sleeping. The man in the bed's chest rose and fell softly with his breathing, and Roger's heartbeat began getting faster and faster. It was time.
He took off the hook attachment from the gun and put the magazine in. Six deadly bullets - but only one would be necessary. Roger went closer to the man, who's face was still shrouded in darkness. Closer and closer and closer, and soon Roger was inches away from his face. He could see him properly now, and Roger stopped dead in his tracks.
The man was *gorgeous*. He was, by far, the most beautiful man he had ever seen. Sharp, high cheekbones, gorgeous blonde hair, long eyelashes and pale skin. Roger felt a rush of blood go to his cheeks, and he dropped his gun with surprise with a loud thud. The man's eyes suddenly flew open: magnificent electric blue eyes. In astonishment, he rolled off the bed and fell right on top of Roger with a groan. Roger scrambled to get up, and the man pushed himself up with his muscular arms. "What the fuck?" he screamed, "what the actual fuck?" Hastily, he flicked on the light switch.
Before Roger stood the hottest man he had ever seen in his entire life. He was tall, and shirtless, with chiseled abs. Annoyance was evident on his handsome face. "Who the everloving fuck are - oh!" he exclaimed, as realisation dawned upon him. "You're Roger Ver! What the hell are you doing here?"
Roger stood, dumbstruck. His mind was blank. He had no idea what to say, or do, but there was one thing he knew for sure: he was in love.
"Well?" Theymos said, "what the fuck, Roger? What do you want?"
"Theymos, I... I wanted to talk to you about activating SegWit."
"What? I thought you hated safe transaction capacity increases."
"I've changed my mind. I'll switch all of my miners over to signal for SegWit activation."
"I'm so confused, what the fuck?"
"But, I have one condition."
"Which is?"
"You have to kiss me, right here, right now."
"..." 
A myriad of expressions ran across Theymos's face. Surprise, distress, confusion, anger. And then, he did the unexpected. He walked up to Roger, grabbed him by the waist and kissed him passionately. They kissed for a few seconds, and Theymos broke away. "Roger, I've always had a crush on you. I've always sort of wanted this to happen."
"Shh, don't ruin the moment." Roger placed a finger on Theymos's lips and began kissing him again. He slowly slid his hand into Theymos's pants, and then slipped off his boxers.
**1 month later**
*Roger and Theymos are now married and are expecting a baby girl. The price of bitcoin is $4,500. SegWit has been activated and Core plans to increase the blocksize within the next 6 months.*
**The End**

Two risks:
1) People could be able to see all your transactions. Not really a huge deal.
2) It makes it easier for a supercomputer to crack your private key. With our current technology it's still near impossible, but if someone makes a quantum computer then with your xPub key they should theoretically be able to crack your private key.

Kind of. I think Andreas Antonopoulos once said something along the lines of "calling bitcoin digital money is like calling the Internet a fancy telephone".
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:19:10
Yeah, I can give you some info.
Firstly, it's not against PayPal's terms of service to sell bitcoins. You are totally allowed to do that.
Secondly, let's talk about chargebacks. In PayPal, you can *either pay with your PayPal balance or a credit/debit card*. If you pay with your balance, PayPal has control over all funds and all disputes. You can also send as *friends and family or goods and services*. Friends and family payments **cannot** be reversed by PayPal when paying by balance, whereas goods and services payments **are disputable**.
Let's say the customer disputes the payment (if made by G&amp;S). You now have to fight the case - sending bitcoin txids and chat logs to prove you send the bitcoins, etc. It's a hassle.
However, if the customer does **not** pay by balance and pays with a card instead, then no matter whether he sends as F&amp;F or G&amp;S, he **can** chargeback the payment by contacting his issuing bank and having the payment reversed. If this happens, there's nothing you can do.
So, if you want to do this:
1) Only deal with **reputed people** and **small amounts**
2) When dealing with non-reputed people, take payments from **balance only** and make sure they send as **friends and family**. It's not worth the hassle to fight a case if they chargeback.
That's it. Hope this helped.

It has a lot of hashpower. If a group of thugs, the government or other powerful people with malicious intent chose to, they could easily 51% attack the network, essentially allowing them to reverse transactions and confirm their own transactions, creating bitcoins that don't really exist. 
Very very unlikely scenario, but still possible.

Let's say BTC is at $100. A megawhale can open a huge short, and say it drops to $50. He then market buys tons of coins for $50. The price inches up to $60, then $70. He then closes his short and buys back the whole stash, pushing the price to $90. 
Same principle, just change the numbers.

Yet demand has never been higher; Bitcoin in India costs $813 USD as of now. ok
@_date: 2016-12-26 08:47:23
Different exchanges have different prices. Let's say Exchange A is at $900 and Exchange B is at $920. Arbritage traders can quickly and easily buy from A and sell on B, bringing the price to parity. This mechanism stops exchanges from having wildly differing prices.
However, in India, the price has increased (more demand) but it is not achieving parity with US exchanges. The reasons are as follows:
- Bitcoin is in **huge** demand due to the demonetization
- Several Bitcoin sites such as Coinbase do not operate in India therefore Indians cannot use such sites
- Indian exchanges are the only places where Indians can buy/sell Bitcoins
- Withdrawing to a bank account is near impossible because if you withdraw Rs. 5000 (~100 USD) more than your monthly income, your account is put under scrutiny and you are questioned
This makes it very hard for arbritage traders to buy in the US and sell in India - simply because you need to be an Indian citizen as well a US citizen to verify your ID with both exchanges, and then you need to explain your earnings and wire them out of the country (paying huge fees in the process). It's not worth the hassle to arb, and thus, the price is where it is.

Satoshi created a way to communicate value in a decentralised way. It's essentially a settlement system over a distributed ledger.
Currency, or money, is one application of such a system. That's what bitcoin has become. However, what Satoshi created opens the door to so much more than just decentralised money. That's why bitcoin and the blockchain truly is the future.

After a 3 year bear market + consolidation period? This is a price increase for sure, but we have not even nearly reached the bubble phase. Bubbles are, in Bitcoin history, normally a 500x increase from the low. The top of the next bubble should near $250,000 per coin.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:39:39
Even if the price suddenly dropped to $250 it wouldn't change the fact that it's the most promising technology of our time.

Here's a good analogy. Let's say the banks are horsecart makers. Bitcoin is the first automobile. The horsecart makers go, "oh, look at this noisy, expensive thing that'll never work". Then they take tyres and put it on the horsecart and call it revolution.

We know bitcoin is deflationary... We know it will be worth more in the future. As Satoshi once said, think of losing coins as a "donation to everyone" as it makes everyone else's coins more valuable. You also got something wrong - one bitcoin will always be worth one bitcoin.

What if nobody supports the minority chain and it dies? (Which, by the way, is a very likely outcome of a hard fork.) One chain.

Here's the thing. Bitcoin, unlike fiat, isn't backed by a central authority. This means, it could fail in literally an instant. On the other hand, it is massively undervalued, as the market cap is a fraction of a fraction of the daily trade volume of a big stock exchange.
Of course, a disclaimer - never put more into bitcoin than you are willing to lose. Prepare for it to go to zero in a matter of minutes. It is very, very unlikely, but certainly possible.
Now, realise how much upside potential this currency has. You are still very early. When bitcoin went from 1 cent to $200, people were asking the same thing. When it went to $500, people were asking the same thing. Now you're here, at around $700, asking this question. In my personal opinion, the answer is always **yes**. Buy bitcoin. Don't end up buying at 10k per coin.

I could say I used fibs, but, to be honest, I saw blood everywhere and I saw coins at monthly lows. I just decided to go all in and buy when they were extremely low, and it turned out well.

So if I bought $200 of bitcoin in 2011 and waited till 2021, I'd have a million million dollars? top kek. I'd say $1,000,000 per coin, nothing more.

If you store your funds offline in a cold/paper wallet then your funds LITERALLY cannot be hacked or stolen. 
And let's be honest, there's only one way the price of bitcoin is going, and that's up. If you don't see a reality where bitcoin is $4000 in 2017 then you're blind.

I have nothing to do and I speak this language, so I'll translate this for you guys.
"The festival of Diwali is close. Diwali is considered the festival of the Goddess Lakshmi, and that's why, on this day, we pray to Lakshmi. The indian Rupee is known as a form of the goddess. You've probably seen many forms of Lakshmi - or money, like the Indian rupee, American dollar, British pound, Japanese yen and Europe's euro. All these currencies are a form of the goddess Lakshmi.
Most of these are made of paper - you can see them with your eyes and put them in your pocket, and you can feel them too. If you go to a country, you need to use only that country's currency. But have you ever heard of a currency that nobody can see? But still, it has become the world's most valuable currency? We are talking about Bitcoin. This is a kind of 'digital currency'. If the Internet was a country, then maybe Bitcoin would be the Internet's national currency.
It's possible that many of you have never heard of Bitcoin. And even if you have, you probably don't know how it works and what it is. So, we've decided to tell you about the world's most valuable currency - because as of today, one coin is worth 45,000 Indian rupees. It doesn't matter that you can't see it, because it's a digital currency. We're also making this segment because an Indian agency is trying to freeze a Bitcoin exchange. Drug sellers are using bitcoin, and a division of the Indian government, the Narcotics Control Bureau has seized 500 bitcoins. As one bitcoin is 45k rupees, the amount frozen is around 2 crores and 25 lakhs.
You're probably wondering - what is bitcoin? How does it work, and why do people worldwide want to buy it? We're going to answer all of these questions today. Bitcoin is the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency, that was specially made for the digital world. Bitcoin can be used whenever and wherever you like. Bitcoin allows for anyone in the entire world to send money to another individual. The best part is, you don't need a bank or a third-party agency to help you out. That means, whenever you'd like to send money, you can send it directly from your Bitcoin wallet to the other person's. This means you only need to pay about 1 rupee in fees, which is very little. Right now, thousands of people are using Bitcoin instead of fiat. If you want to exchange money, you need banks. Banks decide how much money is circulated in a country. However, bitcoin is something that is not controlled by banks, agencies or the government. An exchange of bitcoins happens directly between two people. This transaction is completely encrypted, making it a secure and super-fast way to send your money. However, in your wallet, you don't get notes. You get digital codes, and these codes are your money. 
Now let's explain how bitcoin's value works. Five years ago, one bitcoin was only six rupees. But now, one bitcoin is 45k rupees. Bitcoin was born seven years ago, on 3rd January 2009, thanks to a programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. Till date, nobody knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is. Several people have pretended or claimed to be Nakamoto - but in reality, nobody knows much about the true creator of Bitcoin. Satoshi Nakamoto's aim wasn't to create a currency - it was to prove that, even without a third-party, financial transactions can indeed be made. On the 22nd of May 2010, a pizza was bought for 10,000 bitcoins. This was back when one bitcoin was just 10 cents. But today, bitcoin has risen several thousand percent. Since the inception of bitcoin, many people are trying to buy it, and it's value is rising.
&lt;money counting scene&gt;
The world has different countries - different cultures, different people. Different languages, different cuisines, different powers. But there is one thing that connects everything in the world, and that thing is money.
Today, almost every action requires money - whether it be buying food, buying water, buying a house, or buying weapons - we need money for everything. Several people waste their lives trying to earn money. For money, people work hard, create conflicts, commit crimes - sometimes even kill. But have you ever wondered that this money - this currency - this piece of paper that we call a 'note' - what exactly is it? That piece of paper is a promise. A promise to give you the amount of value written on the note. When you give this note to a shopkeeper, then this 'paper of promise' is with him. The shopkeeper gives you stuff in return. That means, the only value in this paper is the promise that the Reserve Bank of India is making to you. But when you store your cash in a bank, the bank takes a large amount of your money and loans it out to other people. You can see money in your bank account, but the truth is, that money isn't there. The person who loaned out your money buys more stuff, and puts more money in the bank. The bank loans out the money in return, taking a greedy interest as well. This way, that piece of paper becomes the most important financial promise. The truth is, even if only 3% of people all withdrew their money from their banks, the banks would not have enough money to pay them. The entire monetary system is dependant on governments and banks. If a bank messes up, then all your money could be lost. But, bitcoin is an attempt to get away from this regulation and this danger of banks.
Bitcoin is a digital currency and a software. Blahblahblahblah repetition of previous points"
Okay, I got bored. Can't bother translating the rest. I hope that helped.
