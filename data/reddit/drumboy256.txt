Cool story bro.
@_date: 2019-07-10 21:49:42
Let’s be honest, its not like a partnership with ApplePay, you can use a debit card that is on file to purchase.  Although with the Cash App, I don’t why you wouldn’t just use the Cash App to buy Crypto.

This aged well.

You want to borrow $200,000 from me at a low interest rate of 3% to aid in your gambling habits?

Bitcoin is binary..... so why not?
@_date: 2019-11-02 15:22:30
It's not, closed source and host system that is effectively a man in the middle.  Stay away.
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:56:39
Gemini and Delta.
@_date: 2019-11-09 03:43:50
Comments were a year ago.  I've had nothing but success with Gemini of which they are by far the best US based exchange.

So you made $100k or more good job!
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:35:55
But XBY, you’ll get out of debt faster.

I’ll make a PO Box there. 8)

Only caveat is if you got the Crypto as a “gift” ��
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:41:57
You have to “transfer in” from your CB wallet to your CB Pro wallet.  That is free with no charges.  Once done, transferr out to your BTC wallet address.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:15:05
Since most "normies" don't understand the stock market, CB Pro looks too "scary" to them.  With a little simple navigation, CB Pro is actually easier than CB with less fees and better market liquidity entry points.
Either way, I always try and help someone who hasn't figured out the Coinbase 2-Step because once you you get in the groove, you never go back! 8)

Having to use anything but Bitcoin isn't good for security.

You have nobody’s problem then... and investor without funds is just another wage cucked McDs worker trying to buy crypto.  Good luck neet.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:53:35
It’s not and it’s going to go past $12k later tonight.  People are are screwed for not buying in now.
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:28:39
Bitwage and then use Gemini for custodial.

@_date: 2019-06-27 23:23:58
You mean you gained a $16k write off.
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:15:38
It will go up further.  I swear to God people if you aren’t buying now you’re screwed!

We've already hit golden cross and this is a cup and handle.... what else do you people want?
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:03:21
It’s garbage and should be avoided at all costs.  Increased price for increased security surface threat.
