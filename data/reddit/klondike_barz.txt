control and ownership are still different things, though a lack of ownership does nothing to prevent a transaction.

not well. its not even as remotely "clean" as what ethereum did - this requires undoing (or at least having to re-hash the blocks of) hours or days of transactions.
if 60% of miners split now (about 6hrs after the hack), it could take them ~10hrs to "reorg" (fork) that 6hrs of transactions, and then another 14+hrs to try and catch up to be the longest chain.
thats something like 24-40hrs of shutdown to the bitcoin network, assuming 60% of miners even make the move. Realistically (considering time to organize and move miners) you could be looking at a week or two of uncertainty and damage to the bitcoin price. at 25BTC/block incentive as suggested that could mean 50,000+ Bitcoins, not considering any rebuke by the thief.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:08:10
thats a fork dumbass.
you're asking miners to go back to te block where the theft happens, and build a brand new reorg (ie: chain) from that point. Thats called a fork because it creates two highly-competitive chains.

exactly. the blockchain is effectively a database that lists entry history and does not allow revision. Both can be decentralised, fraud-proofed, allow identity/signature creation, etc.  But it all comes down to wo has the rights to enter information to it.
in bitcoin its miners. they create a fee structure and have financial incentive. This incentive results in a large hashrate, which acts as an anti-tampering mechanism that prevents any one party from controlling/censoring what is added.
as a currency-backed blockchain, bitcoin *should* be the most secure public global database
i think its just a matter of time to understand that, and the steepest part of the initial learning curve for bitcoin

thats why i explained the difference in testing 2mb (which is fundamentally not much different than 1mb), and testing the fork code which dictates the trigger/rollout mechanism ('borrowed' from XT/BIP101, and tested to a decent extent already i think)

there's a whole list of reasons why miners would still operate after halving, such as property fees, financially supporting the blockchain (if mining at a loss), or simply understanding that if they allow the difficulty to 'crash' it could destroy their livelihood of mining.
i expect there to be a week or two where blocktimes are painfully slow (~15min) and fees become much higher for that period, but it would stabilize quite quickly once the first difficulty adjustment occurs

@_date: 2016-04-09 17:06:44
not much to test fundamentally - more space = scaling, and is achieved by very simple increase in Maxblocksize.
the parts that would need testing are bandwidth/latency related to larger blocks, and ensuring the hardfork-procedure portion of the code is safe and will work correctly (this has been tested pretty thoroughly with the XT/BIP101/classic testnets IIRC)
that said, im sure segwit is getting the full test procedure done on it by most of the capable devs in the bitcoin ecosystem, but its still a much more complicated method of scaling than to simply raise an arbitrary spam limiter from 2010
ps: the blocksize limit was added months (almost a year?) after the  first blocks were mined. it was not in the whitepaper or part of the protocol (like the fixed 21M limit) and was implemented at a time when the average blocksize was &lt;100kb
@_date: 2016-04-10 00:35:22
such as providing additional blockspace within the block (maxblocksize), or shuffling some transaction data to a secondary block (segwit)

There is no PoW that solves the problem of PoW centralization.
but, you say "nuh-uh, consumer-level GPUs that everyone owns, those cant centralize because everyone has them!"
lets say that average Joe is lucky and already owns *TWO* R9-380x GPUs in a home computer, which draws ~500W when mining. There's no upfront costs to Joe, and an algoritm like ethereum/X11 should provide him with ~$3/day ($1.50/gpu/day) assuming he cashes out frequently at the common exchange rate. 500W at $0.15/kwh is about $50/month of electricity.  So wit no upfront costs, and assuming Joe can reliably mine $3/day (averaged though price fluctuations and switching to the most profitable algorithms), Joe makes $40/month in profit. Less for time when the computer is busy with other tasks and you must consider the extra noise and heat produced (might need an A/C by summertime to counteract it). Thats maybe $480 in a year, under favorable conditions
Now, look at someone who wants industrial. They buy budget components (mobo/ram/cpu/hdd), and construct *one hundred* 5-GPU/mobo systems. With bulk pricing and the OS/remote-management software preloaded on the harddrives, they could have 500 R9-380X units operational within a week and at a cost &lt;$125,000. Thats $750/day mining revenue, and they would be running in an area where heat/noise are not a concern and power is $0.05/kwh and lower watts/gpu average because of the 5cards/mobo configuration. Thats something like $200,000-225,000/year PROFIT after power costs. even with the $125,000 upfront costs (not even considering the consumer-grade hardware would still have a $60,000+ liquidation value after a year) and costs associated with renting a small industrial building with &gt;10kW of available power hookups and ongoing overhead costs, there is still room to pull profit in the first year. second year wont even have upfront costs.
this scales up. when farms with 1000+ GPUs begin to show up, difficulty will reach a point where anyone paying &gt;$0.20/kwh is unprofitable, regardless of whether you already own a GPU or not.
just because there isnt an ASIC (yet), does not mean you wont see centralization. If its profitable to do so, people with the money *WILL* build or invest in multi-million dollar GPU (or CPU, or PoS, or RAM/storage-based) mining facilities where power is cheap enough that it is profitable despite upfront/overhead costs. Bitcoin did it, scrypt did it, even ethereum is doing it (there are quite a few individuals and organisations with 100+ GPU rigs already)
edit: How about some proof in the form of a 360+ GPU mining facility

You completely lost me.
I consider the ability of people to organise via services like twitter, partly because state police/military action made traditional communication dangerous, an extremely GOOD thing. That it helped to create a civilian revolution and force change to government was the reason why police and government policies became so strict and overwhelming to so many people. Yes, the outcome is still unstable, but you don't go from a dictatorship to smoothly-running multi-party democracy overnight. So I'm not sure what your point was regarding making using chainanchor to *force* KYCesque functionality onto bitcoin transactions
regarding your edit, whats your solution(s) to centralization? I think its unavoidable and will centralize over the following years into an industry led by 3-5 major chip makers and a few dozen major companies/franchises that account for ~80% of the hashrate spread across 100-200 major (1MW+) facilities globally. Facilities of this size may be able to mine without a pool, or choosing pool servers that are well-balanced for hashrate. This industry may see regulation beyond basic taxation (such as KYC), but many already sell coins directly to bitcoin exchanges.  I dont see any need to solve a scenario like this, as long as over time no singlular entity controls &gt;15% of the network and there is some transparency provided.

if you do some fairly basic technical analysis (like with a stock or other commodities), bitcoin has been in a bullish trend pattern for &gt;6 months, meeting resistance in the 450-500 highs seen around december, but appearing "ready" to move higher than $500.
based on the way the price fell from 1100, it stopped for a while in the $650-700 range. Therefor if bitcoin passes $500, there likely wont be much selling pressure until it reaches $650-680 again. (followed by a fall back to ~$550 and restabilizing in the $600 price range)

Thats useful for some devices that might be permenantly plugged in but not interacted with by the owner (such as a laundry machine, fridge, etc)

thats an insanely long time. Majority Consensus can be obtained in less than 2 months
It a 2MB version of core (with 90% requirement to activate) was released today, I bet we could see the network adopt a 2MB blocksize by March. XT would likely patch in the 2MB rule as well (with or without keeping the BIP101 activation rules)
@_date: 2015-12-14 01:48:42
Same here. only ~20% of my savings are in the canadian dollar, the rest are US stocks and my bitcoins, and it feels good to be somewhat insulated from the price difference.
also, it makes for an advantage mining, since $0.15cad/kwh (ontario) is only $0.11usd (and $0.03 cheaper at night), reasonable for up to ~0.8w/GH
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:38:04
At this point, that just brings us back to the 2-4-8 adjustment which has mixed support and could take a while to reach any consensus.
2MB cankick is just the easiest safest change and doubles current capacity to allow testing/observation as to what good/bad effects result. another 4MB or 8MB fork could easily be deployed a year later based on the results.
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:01:31
This is pretty staggering. these chips are about 4x the hashrate of the newest bitmain chips, with similar power draw and likely a similar physical size.
If bitmain moves to 14nm/16nm, they should be able to *almost match this efficiency (currently 0.25w/GH at 28nm, capable of ~0.2w/GH if run at lower voltage).
 If spondoolies can replicate thier SP50 chip design (purportedly 0.16w/GH at 28nm) they would be able to match or potentially exceed the efficiency of this bitfury chip.
however, its likely both these companies are anywhere from 2-6 months behind (assuming both have already begun to design a new chip and/or started putting production orders for the silicon)
Once that occurs, I expect there will be some type of plateau around the 0.05-0.07w/GH efficiency level that could last a year or more until 10/12nm becomes viable, otherwise the best you can do is continuously improve on the 14nm/16nm designs to squeeze out a few percent gains
My guess is we have 3.25 Exahash by 2017 (4x current hashrate, or 5%/jump continuous growth), but this requires bitcoin price to grow past $800USD during that time
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:47:02
bailing out? What sensible business would not want more people to use thier bitcoin services? A larger blocksize allows more transaction volume and *presumably* will lead to greater adoption.

"a change of algorithm"
ABSOLUTELY NOT, THATS SUICIDE.

a hard fork isnt the FUD its being made out as. If a good proposal was implemented into core and an update alert pushed out, I bet 50% of miners would change within a week, and 90% within a month.
If a 2MB cankick was coded into Core today, I bet it could be activated within 2 months
@_date: 2015-12-07 18:12:58
I need to look into the details further, but what if a full node 'faked' fraud proof (via false info or by imposing a modified rule set such as block size limits)? Could this cause issues for connected SPV nodes?
@_date: 2015-12-31 04:57:50
a softfork can effectively reduce un-updated nodes to SPV nodes that are unable to validate blocks/transactions that follow rules they do not 'understand'
A hardfork would cause these nodes to alert the user that they are not receiving ANY valid blocks from the network, and requires an update.
increasing blocksize changes 1-2 lines of code, and could be released as a fork that requires &gt;xx% (ie 90%) of blocks to be mined with it before the increased blocksize rule actually implements.
implementing segwit basically creates blocks with 'external' data that still require downloading/validation, would likely implement without majority approval, and a softfork requires MANY more lines of code (that have not been extensively tested) which would need to be re-coded into a hardfork eventually in any case.
@_date: 2015-12-04 14:07:05
You make it sound like other digital crypto currencies are not remotely similar to bitcoin. They are, and are virtually identical in code besides algorithm and block size/frrqurncy.
Obviously it's not the perfect test bench or comparison (neither is the bitcoin test net which has low transfer volume and hashrate), but it's something.
Doge/ltc have significant market caps (combined it's only a fraction of bitcoin's), so attacking then does have financial incentive. And yet transaction bloat or large-block attacks have not been an issue. It seems safe to take away the understanding that 4mb/10minutes is not dangerous.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:41:47
exactly the idea. A fork occurs, and *ideally* the chain with larger blocksize gains the clear majority. Bitcoin-1MB dies and the new chain is mined
@_date: 2015-12-28 21:33:57
a safe hardfork should be able to get 75% approval within a week, and 90% within a month *IF ITS WHAT PEOPLE WANT*
a good 50% of mining pools/companies have spoken about supporting 2-4-8, BIP101, etc - so it seems likely that if a 2MB cankick was supported by bitcoin core, it could easily be implemented within 2 months. of today.
and then SW can be implemented to allow 6-8MB effective space, and lightning if still necessary
@_date: 2015-12-28 04:28:21
^fair enough. either one is a while away since &lt;10% of nodes are XT and much less mining power. If 75% DID move over though, thatwould be a clear majority (particularly if you assume a minority of miners would actively resist this/any change)

"threatening"? more like moving past the roadblock.

MORE importantly, the subsidy is the introduction of new bitcoins (inflation) to the economy.

the bitcoin nightclub might be at the occupancy limit, but its not at capacity.
Reasonable assumptions of continued bitcoin acceptance and use indicates we could be at 1MB very soon, and potentially rise by anything from 50%/yr-500%/yr depending on demand and functionality.
I think setting the maximum to 1.5-2.5x the average size of the last 2-3 months of transactions is safe. It would take a rediculously dedicated attack to try and create ~16MB blocks within 12 months from now - which simply doesnt seem likely.
the issue is that 1MB is simply arbitrary and to act as a sort of  spam filter. generally, miners only accept transactions that contain a minimum BTC/kb cost for data. They will always be free to choose what transactions are accepted and its the miners who effectively set the fees. 2MB would just be a new arbitrary limit, and hitting it could see fees start rapidly increasing while everyone bickers about forking it to 4MB
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:37:19
but for anything more than token payment, mining simply isnt logical. Your cellphone drawing an extra 50% power/heat when charging simply does not compare to a 40MW immersion-cooled facility. its mining at a loss, and probably not good for your battery either.

allows you to send coins to an address with an attached condition that basically says "lock these coins as unspendable until blockchain exceeds XXXXX blockheight"

you are blind to the reality then. LTC network is worth almost $150Mil, dogecoin $13Mil. (so about 2% and .2% of bitcoin respectively). 
if you will not look at testnet results, or evaluate the circumstances or similar cryptocurrencies, then of course you will think that change brings disaster. Bigger blocks *can be* safe and are a necessity. The size and rate of growth are the issues. (ie: surely 1.1MB will make no difference to how the network operates? perhaps 2MB? the most realistic and achievable IMO is BIP101)

I think if a 2MB version of core was released as a hardfork, it would reach 75% deployment within a month, 95% within 2 months. consider that ~80% of hashrate is controlled by pools, many of which have voiced support for various blocksize adjustments.
With a clear move from core, I bet as much as 50% of hashrate would support the new version within a week

doing some extremely basic estimates here, but 1080p quality video is about 1.4-3.4 Mbps (~0.3MBps) 
4k video would be ~1.2MBps. 16k would be 4.8MBps. 8 streams = 38.4GBps / 307Gbps  (about 200x your estimate, not considering codecs or improved compression)
10MBps is already common. 1GBps is available to datacenters and limited geographic areas. To think this can't increase 40x in 20yrs is naive.

It boils down to two issues
1) 'XT' as a client other than 'core': this does not make it an altcoin at all. it simply operates as a bitcoin node/wallet with a few tweaks and different basic settings. absolutely nothing altcoinish about this, thats like saying every linux implementation is completely,incompatibly different from the others.
2) BIP101 is included in XT, and is designed to 'activate' once the majority of miners are mining BIP101-enabled blocks with XT software. *IF* BIP101 enables without a clear majority of support, it would be a fork of bitcoin AT WHICH POINT yes, it would be an altcoin (in that bitcoins in the XT ledger would be seperate from bitcoins in the Core ledger. both ledgers would exist until miners begin playing withe various methods of hashrate attack.)
XT itself is not an altcoin. *IF* BIP101 is prematurely (&lt;75% mejority) activated, it would become a fork with its own distinct bitcoin ledger
commonsense dictates that an early activation of BIP101 would be a bad idea and create a weak blockchain. But the 75% parameter is entirely reasonable and does not make it an altcoin - simply a measure of consensus.

I had a transaction (2BTC) get stuck for nearly 4 hours because my core/QT wallet fee was a bit too small. It was not a spam transaction, and it was affected by the backlog. 
kicking the can to 2MB is ridiculously easy, and Im sure 75% of the network would be able to switch software within 7days, 90% within a month. To suggest waiting almost a year to increase is just silly and will have ramifications on bitcoin usage
@_date: 2015-12-03 13:05:44

while it may have begun exponentially it will likely follows an 'S-curve' where the most rapid phase of growth has occurred, and the rate of growth will begin to slowly decay. look at mining hashrates as an example.
I don't entirely rule out a $5000 BTC within the next year and $25000 by 2020 - but that basically relies on at least one major price/adoption rally and a bear scenario of $100 and $20 is equally possible

+1. miners can already do that, but not to the same extent.
granted, ~80% of the network is &lt;50TH miners and usually on pools or f2p - i dont think the limit reducing would ever be an issue, but i also think the ability to reduce should be limited, and the inital limit set to 2MB if not 4MB. Once the successful code change occurs bitcoin could see volume build fast in a bubble situation (which spawns profitable home mining and MASSIVE megafarms)

The issue eight now is that spam is sent with very low amounts of btc and minimal fees.
If spam wants to start paying enough to be included within the next block or two - they will burn through the budget extremely fast. The entire thing is optimized to give priority to larger transactions with more age and higher fees

I think you're right - and this is one of those 'anti-fragility' situations where an attacker needs &gt;$20M of mining infrastructure (bare minimum) to cause significant issues, in the process harming bitcoin and drastically reducing the value of thier own investment
im starting to get on board with this proposal, but would still like to see formal implementation plans for both
1) fixed size plan (perhaps with hardcoded increases, such as 8MB now, 16MB in a year, 32MB in 2 years)
2) algorithm: MAX = 1.5(average size of last 6000 blocks) + 0.5(average size of last 2000 blocks)   
i think theres a variety of solutions that could work, but some might be better than others at combating miner collusion or spam/DoS
@_date: 2015-06-12 16:01:01
I appreciate seeing a fully-fleshed idea put into PDF and formally 'released' - it needs to happen so that the community can choose an EXACT solution.
1) 2MB isnt enough. thats a 2x growth which could happen very quickly in the next 12 months. I say 4MB which allows much more room but without the excess of 20MB
2) the soft fork method sounds great - but at the same time parameters in bitcoin should be decided by mathematical rules and not by simply changing those rules. Noone wants a solution that will have to be changed yearly
3) I am a firm beleiver in raising the cap based on the blocksize history. make the maximum size something like 2x the average of the last 6000 blocks - it will increase dynamically, leave a [reasonable] amount of space but create bidding wars occasionally, and be resistant to even long-term spam/DoS attacks.
4) the solution should be rolled out slightly faster than December. Theres a chance we could see the 1MB limit causing issues by then due to new applications and user demand
A dynamic rule rather than just adding 1MB more room seems like a better path

I doubt the 21 chip is only 30c to install. it requires a heatsink, voltage regulator, and additional CPU overhead to mine. At best it would cost $1/5GH
21.co software is not reliant on integrated mining though. and where do you get 20-30 devices from? As i see, a household of 4 has:
4 phones, 2 cars, 3 TV's (+3 cable/satellite receivers), 4 computers, 3-4 connected appliances like fridge/oven/laundry = ~20 objects total, most of which dont need the blockchain and/or could easily be loaded with a few mBTC over the internet or by scanning a prepaid QR code. The cableboxes/cellphones could easily have a monthly subcription added to their billing
most of the IoT has no reason to send payments/blockchain tokens, and could communicate perfectly fine via SMS/email. Its not like your fridge needs to spend 1satoshi to broadcast its temperature to your phone's app, let alone produce heat by mining.

@_date: 2015-06-05 22:58:17
the bigger issue about the blocksize change isnt the size itself, its that a fundamental (if poorly chosen and arbitrary) function of bitcoin is being changed - which defeats the concept of 'the bitcoin "math" is set in stone' 
These things should not need to be changed unless absolutely required, or it could lead to a slippery slope. 
IMO, a math function for the limit is key - one that accounts for long-term and short-term trends, without being susceptible to rapid growth (&gt;10x growth in a month being sensible maximum limit)
T = 2*(average size of last 6000 blocks) + 0.5*(average size of last 600 blocks)
its a healthy limit and should always be ~2.5x the size of the average over the last 40 days. Plenty of room for 'business hours' or blocks that take longer to mine. If the limit is reached almost consistently for a week, the cap could grow by ~3x
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:06:20

I don't like the voting system - what if the majority of miners started REDUCING the blocksize limit? 
it could drive up transaction fees, possibly making more fees/block since only the highest bidders are included. (simultaneously acting as a DoS attack)
granted, that could hurt bitcoin and thus is not in the miner's interest - but im not sure if handing the blocksize vote to miners (who will want the best fees and [slightly] prefer smaller blocks) is the solution or a new problem.
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:56:07
Doubtful. More like sold a large amount at 500 and happily bought back at 350-400 range

its naive to think this way, mining is an arms race no matter what the  algorithm, blocksize, or other requirement.
If something is profitable, an industry forms around it. An industry is competitive, and the company/miner who can reduce overhead and minimize losses (such as orphans) will succeed in it.
yeah, there are some big miners in china. power is cheap and electronics can be cheaply assembled there also. The downside is they risk orphans when sending blocks. But there are also miners in Iceland (KnC), north america (washington state, manitoba, and Newfoundland/labradorall come to mind as the cheapest), and other geographic areas (such as thailand, panama, etc).
to say that larger blocks = centralization in china is just absurd. Its like a Donald trump speech. If the majority of hashrate is in places NOT CHINA (ie: 90% of the world), then china is actually disadvantaged because of the increased orphan rate. Smart miners there (and everywhere else) will recognize that even a 1% orphan rate reduction justifies investment in better network infrastructure.
Centralisation will occur regardless of blocksize. The only way to provoke strong decentralization is to keep bitcoin value high enough that anyone can mine profitably, regardless of electricity price. (obviously this has the longterm effect that the most-profitable miners still increase the size of their farms faster than those less-profitable, which is why the "XXX=centralisation" argument is worthless)

@_date: 2015-12-24 16:50:31
centralisation is happening regardless of block size. Other than the chinese firewall latency issue(which is only affecting like 25% of hashrate), mining profit margins already favor those who can scale thier operations in areas of cheap electricity/cooling. This occurs regardless of blocksize, as even small miners can connect to a pool and only need to send a few kb of data.
as for node centralisation, thats not even a huge issue. noone wants a 60Gig (or 600gig, or even a pruned 5gig) blockchain on thier phone - they want an spv or web wallet that pulls information from a trusted node (such as a simple blockchain or mycelium wallet). I do see how lightning could offer benefits to those who can operate a fully-fledged node by effectively selling cpu/hdd/ram capabilities for 'channels', but feel thats still a distinct fee market from the blockchain, which should not be capped at 1MB, but rather let miners decide whats worth including
@_date: 2015-06-13 01:51:14
Giving control to the miners will only serve to create large fees down the road if they choose not to increase thier size.
1mb was an arbitrary value set 6 years ago. There's no reason increasing to 5mb or 10mb will be any issue at all. 2mb is too minute a growth

I see the biggest barrier to bitcoin growth being the difficulty in safe storage. At this point there are only three real options:
1) store it on unencrypted hot/cold wallets that are vulnerable to theft or destruction (such as a fire that destroys your paper wallets and you didn't have an offsite copy - which would rely on a trusted second party)
2) store it encrypted and risk losing the passwords to access it forever
3) store it on a website /exchange where it is vulnerable to other issues and assumed trust of the site operators.
The next big shift will happen when a secure form of insured storage is made available. The nasdaq ETF should achieve this, and i forsee large banking institutions being able to offer secure cold/hot storage accounts in the future, just like they do with cash deposits. (disregarding the argument that banks may use this for loans and other things that led to fiat currency crashes)

as a further to the above question, should the Bitcoin Foundation more actively pursue development of the bitcoin protocol to address any issues that have been brought up in the 5+ years since inception. 
--including things like looking at if the decision to move to a 1minute block time (w/ 10% reward) is sustainable for the miners and whether continuing at 10min blocktimes might lead to centralised 3rd-party processors for businesses and transactions where waiting for confirmations cannot exceed 5min (such as bitpay, who will likely increase fees over time in exchange for only the benefits of a faster sidechain)
there are some great ideas that have been brought up by more recent altcoins that could be built into the bitcoin code over time and with thourough evaluation and requests for input

It's unlikely they would hit the same house again unless it was a substantial (30btc in a lousy neighborhood or 80btc in a nice area) amount. Its common knowledge that after a break in the homeowner will be more cautious and up the security measures.
Your story makes me want to install a gps tracker inside my safe - in a case like yours that would have let you find where they went. (going a step further to hide the gps inside so it's not found when the safe is cracked would be even better as they wouldn't realise they are tracked)

the above said, I think that when bitcoin goes back over $1000/BTC that the mBTC is a totally valid way of denoting currency value in a more everyday small-payments environment like at the coffee shop.
but for fuck sakes, dont call it a 'bit'. call it "M-B-T-C" for the sake of having people know what you are talking about. If society in general wants to start calling it something else let it happen that way.
$10 can be called 10 dollars, 10 bucks, a dime, whatever other localised phrase. but everyone knows the real term is 10 'DOLLARS'
and as an extra thought - a bit makes more sense as the term for 0.00000001 BTC as that is the lowest possible denominator.

the number of nodes we have today is not an issue at all.
and centralization of mining is 100% inevitable. The guys who have 20TH or more today are the ones that had 500TH and dozens or hundreds of GPUs a year or 2 ago.
I started mining in september and now control 4.2TH with over 10BTC in reserve for hardware purchase in the next few weeks.

Teapot is not designed for space travel, and would certainly burn up from the heat of the sun or be struck by meteorites. There is no evidence mankind ever launched a teapot into space, let alone solar orbit.
People have list, misplaced, and forgotten about bitcoin - like that story last year of a guy who realised he had thrown away a hard drive with 650k worth of Bitcoin's on it. I think "more than half" is a high number, I am sticking with my 3-5 million estimate, which is probably a bit conservative and still accounts for ~1/3rd of all bitcoins mined.
Also, iirc, satoshi mined thousands of Bitcoin's in the early days (400,000 I think is the number) and those have not moved since. Perhaps he lost/destroyed access to them, perhaps they are being held until they are worth billions

All great points. In a worst-case situation I beleive gold will hold value far better than bitcoin can because of its physical uses.

1) facility likely means all the buildings on the singular premises / property 
2) the network is growing so fast that even if a gov began construction of a 250PH facility, by the time of completion it would push the entire network up to ~700ph. They would find themselves in the same arms race as everyone else mining
3) converting existing buildings, particularly apartments, is far far far from ideal. Look at this facility, it is built based on the requirements: lots if airflow, cheap means of cooling the intake air, massive power density. Its probably 2-3x the wattage of an apartment building with the same footprint but only 1 storey tall

malleability is different. malleability means copying an existing transaction with a small about of extra but useless data so that the network sees two identical transactions, only one of which will ever go through. Some older wallet software got confused by this and displayed both which could cause bugs in the accessible wallet balances compared with what actually was there.
double-spending is different. 
AFAIK both are still possible, but malleability has been dealt with so that at the very worst its an annoyance and not a threat

The points about the low ceiling and inadequate fans I dont agree with. The place was built as a wind tunnel, not a big open warehouse where you let the heat convect out. This system probably drew in fresh air, rammed it through the miners, and blew it out the side of the building in one shot. no need to convect heat upwards or use raised floor cooling. 
Air likely came in at 20-30C (thailand) and was exhausted in under 1minute around 55-65C.
Staffing was the issue. the workers were asleep when the fire started, and if it had been spotted in the fiorst 10min and the electrical safety shutoff hit, the damage may have been restricted to just a few units. Instead, it took about an hour to spread through the building and presumably was electrically fed the entire time.
workers and a poor choice of panel/breakers were the cause, and having the correct form of either would have stopped the fire almost immediately

1) not sure what the purpose is of the name, it's not compatability with most wallets yet?
2) you can reuse an address as much as wanted. Its pretty common if you want to have a single donation address everyone can send to and monitor/audit

Saying that locktite can be defeated is virtually meaningless - it is only the first barrier against access to the hologram, which would require additional tampering to try and bypass. The security is on par with any casascius coin, but perhaps a lasered hologram like the 2013 silver casascius coins would add another level of security.
Regarding the private key, I agree entirely. A 2fa key destroys the secondary sales market, and even then trusts you to actually have a matching private key under the hologram to begin with (ie: the public key may be loaded but no privkey at all under the hologram would make even 2fa reliant on trusting you). Having a basic private key like a casascius makes this more meaningful

because most mining equipment now might sseem like gains are slim due to power costs. as BTC prices rise though this fraction of the earning that is lost on power expenses is dwarfed.
buy antminer S1 for 0.5BTC. most calculations show it can mine about 1BTC before it is losing money by the day. At $400/BTC and $0.15/kwh that is about breakeven.  you make a profit of [0.5BTC -$200 in power costs] = ~$0.  You would still have your original 0.5BTC back plus obsolete hardware.
same example, but now BTC goes to $1000.  Thats a profit of [0.5*1000 - $200] = $300 or 0.3BTC profit (on top the original 0.5BTC plus obsolete machine).
btc doubling in USD prices does not double your holdings in BTC.  when you look at bitcoin mining you need to look at the bitcoins you invest against the bitcoins you mine, THEN the dolar value of electricity

general belief mostly. Imagine in 2009/2010 you mined a few dozen bitcoins, maybe $10 worth, in the span of a week or less. With very few ways to spend it it may have been put aside and forgotten or lost.
In 2009, a bitcoin was worth pennies. to reformat a harddrive with a few hundred or thousand of these useless novelty coins was easier then saving them if you didnt have much continued interest. 
Add to that the thousands of transactions sent to incorrect/non-existent addresses, or lost in a wallet with unknown encryption (I personally have a year-old armory wallet that holds 1BTC and uses a password not matching any of the hundreds of likely options i tried).
I think its entirely safe to say that 3-5 Million bitcoins of those currently in existance will never be used for the above reasons. The current price may seem somewhat stagnant, but the market cap is growing significantly every day

3 years ago, probably 80% of all bitcoins were held by Satoshi and Hal Finney. That its now 50% across 950 people shows a very clear distribution pattern.

problem is, if you want 1500W of electric heat you can buy 4 antminer S1 units (at about $300 total) that will mine maybe $200 total this winter. doesnt inlude power supplies.
or, you can buy a 1500W space heater at walmart for $19-$39. such as 
no additional power supplies, takes less space, is queter, and saves you about $70. The cost to produce computer chips that emit heat when working compared to a simple electric coil is more than you would mine.

I am inclined to agree. There are two additional factors though
1) newly-mined btc is sold off instantly by many of the larger farms, providing a relatively steady supply to the market.
2) remember that even if the price stayed constant, the market cap increases ~$2.5M/day with newly mined coins (25btc x 6 x 24hrs = 3600btc/day created)

There are still limitations, namely to other brute force means of entry. $60 worth of tools can break most &lt;$600 safes. $200 worth of tools can break into or through a hell of a lot of things.
On the other hand, some drug addict with a hammer probably won't be getting very far, and is more likely to dump the safe then to buy tools and spend hours forcing entry.
Would be interesting to know which category your safe falls into. I'd put $20 worth of bitcoin back onto the paper wallet and monitor it to see if it moves in the next week or two.

With regards to  there is no problem in reusing an address, as long as your wallet controls the private key.

I disagree. There is a MAJOR difference between a stock split and renaming the common bitcoin denomination.
If a stock costs $500 and you only have $200, you CANT buy a share. period. If it splits down to $50/share you could buy 4 shares and have $200 worth of that stock. 
If Bitcoin costs $500 and you only have $200, you CAN buy a fraction of a bitcoin. You can easily buy any fraction of a bitcoin, down to 8 decimal points, and invest the full $200 at whatever the exchange rate is.
furthermore, if the stock in the first example split down to $50.01 and you only had $200 - you could only buy 3 shares and have $49.97 left. YOU CANNOT BUY A FRACTION OF A SHARE.

There are 3 theories:
1) the coins are lost - private keys misplaced or destroyed. He may own coins bought/mined separately though
2) one day, he will crash all the markets with hundreds of thousands of coins
3) he will trickle some into the market, possibly with a public announcement of his intents. If he explains that 1000 coins will be liquidated monthly (for quite a long period of time) it would have only a small effect on the market and perhaps add stability to the price of bitcoin if deflation occurs too rapidly

I received my coinkite card yesterday :)
@_date: 2014-09-30 23:45:03
The simple way:
1) The governing body of the vote issues each voter a public/private keypair that is unique to them, like a voter registration card.
2) you send a small amount (a satoshoi is ideal) from your individual address to one of the designated addresses (there's a single public address for each option/candidate)
3) Simple software combs the blockchain for: How many unique addresses sent to each 'choice', whether there are multiple from the same address (to same or multiple 'choice's), and that the sending addresses are from the list of registered addresses.
in terms of something like a federal election, the private keys could be mailed to voters just like voter registration cards are today. There may be some precautions required in to prevent theft of this info (both within the mail system and within the elections office)
The other option would be that in the future, most citizens have a public [bip32 hierarchical] address associated with their SIN, and used by the IRS for taxes, income, etc. This address would thus be in a database and could vote via the above process without the need for an election-specific private key. (again, this is something that could take decades to achieve if bitcoin became a global currency)

Asics are not bad. Any argument that they enable centralized mining can be shot down by doing some googling and seeing that 2years ago there were people running dozens or hundreds of gpu miners in attics or offices they rented for the purpose. A year ago these people switched to fpgas and started mining 100s of ghash/s.
Anyone who wants to operate a huge amount of bitcoin mining hardware could do it at any point in the past or in the future, asic designs just mean the hardware is more specialised than a Re purposed graphics card.

you are kidding right? Litcoin does have scrypt ASIC devices.
The point is, building an ASIC can be done for any simple repeating task, but the initial R&amp;D can cost millions. Unless a cryptocurrency has a market cap &gt;$100M there is no real incentive to build an ASIC and likely damage the currency by prooving it is not asic-proof anymore.
Bitcoin SHA256 ASIC devices are not a bad thing - they are cheap enough that even an "investor" with $500 can buy hardware that provides a reasonably good chance at achieving a positive return. That seems pretty decentralised, although for a great majority of miners building larger centralized farms can be the best profit margins. Thats normal for any industry with a market cap like what BTC is achieving
@_date: 2014-06-07 15:26:35
I just came to reddit to mention this myself. and BTCguild is rapidly losing miners to ghash making it worse.
choose a pool that is in the 8%-15% network share range. you will get returns every ~2days, and still assist in distributing te network hashrate properly.
ELIGIUS: no fees, NMC-merged mining, nice stats page, newly minted cins go direct to your mining address rather than a site-based wallet that is locked by a 'security holy grail' of username/password (cough, gox, cough) about 10% of the network
MINING.cz / SLUSH:  great pool, I think the oldest pool and very stable. the guys behind it designed trezor. IIRC theres a small ~0.5% fee and you get NMC-merged mining. about 6% of the network
just get off of ghash. no pool should be enabled to go beyond a 20% network share and while you are paid more often on a ~2week timescale the variance between pools balances out.

I expect the bids were above the current market value, perhaps significantly. If you pushed an $18M buy order on multiple exchanges over a period of a week or two it would almost certainly tear down multiple levels of support right up to $700, maybe more. 
The benefits of having a maximum of ten different winning bids for this many coins (in round numbers) is also very beneficial for record-keeping purposes and keeping exchange prices stable.

There will be dozens of prominent (100kW+) mining facilities by the end of this year, and more in 2015.

All the other responses are the reasons why they sell. Iirc, the big example is knc who have been shown to/acknowledged that they liquidate most or all of thier income to repay costs and to pay for production of new equipment.

Ideally, a hard-fork / algorithm that does this:
1) immediately increase to 5MB block size
2) will reasonably increase to 15MB in 6 months
3) will reach ~30MB in 2 years
4) will reach ~120MB in 4 years
5) and so on, ideally doubling every year

You want faster times? Use dogecoin or litecoin.
As was said the transaction is immediately available. It's the same as being given a cheque that takes a few minutes to actually cash. If the buyer runs off double spending in the meantime, you post a picture of them by the register and report theft to the police. Double spending is theft.
Changing the block times would drastically change bitcoin, and block times &lt;2minutes only serve to promote centralization since big forms have far lower latency and fewer orphans that small individuals with lots of orphaned shares

You're talking as a buyer. A seller must be cautious of new buyers, and if you talk to people that sell on ebay a lot you'll get a recurring feedback that they experience charge backs regularly, and can't fight it as paypal often sides with the buyer. This means slightly higher prices to compensate the 2% of charge back cases.
As a seller, bitcoin is fantastic, and hopefully will lead to lower prices and discounts to bitcoin payers. 
Again, as a buyer on a random new website, using bitcoin saves either trusting someone with your credit card data, or forcing them to pay idiotic (5-10%) paypal fees so that paypal can be the ones holding your private bank info.

It would likely require a 500%+ price increase, quickly enough (&lt;3 months) that the difficulty can only increase 100-150% during that time (mostly 1-2w/Gh gear returning).

@_date: 2015-05-27 20:16:51
I disagree. Even today fees make up as much as 3% of the block reward (usually 0.2-0.5btc/block), which is significant. 
Assume in 8 years that the block reward is 6.25btc and that the fees are up &gt;1btc/block. 
Assume another 8 years and the reward is now ~1.6btc. Block rewards are likely still to be &gt;1btc unless the price is exponentially higher (talking &gt;$20,000)

@_date: 2017-02-10 19:36:56
i just wasnt sure what you were trying to say, whether 2000tps is possible and just the beginning, or if ______tps is pointless when offchain solutions exist
IMO we can scale almost limitlessly onchain as long as enough miners and nodes enforce *some kind of limit* (ie: if enough nodes refuse to relay any blocks that are 10x the average blocksize, a "1TB block attack" simply wont relay quick enough, and the next reasonably-sized block will orphan it).
i dont expect everyone to carry around the blockchain on thier phones and laptops in the future, because that would limit its size somewhat arbitrarily. 
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:52:05
a) its necessary because blocks are almost full (regardless if you think its 10% spam or 30% spam), and unless you want bitcoin to fail, it sould be anticipated that the number of users and transactions can still easily increase 50-fold from what it is now. even with sidechains and segwit, i dont think bitcoin could settlement for that many users.
b) there is a 2mb testnet working fine. (meanwhile segwit forked the testnet due to a bug). logisticlaly, 2MB vs 1MB is pretty basic. based on moore's law and the similar rate of bandwidth growth, if 1MB was safe 6 years ago 8MB sould be safe today. 2MB is purely trivial and supposed to be a compromise
@_date: 2017-02-04 03:25:49
bitcoin can be all that and more. IMO in the future a significant fraction of full nodes will be powerful systems capable of handling all the bandwidth they need to keep up a larger majority of non-sharing nodes. Squabbles about disksize (by the time we hit 1TB, youll have 4TB SSDs for $100), bandwidth (who cares about the dsl nodes being able to relay, when theres a network of datacenters with GBps internet), or computation power (we can handle it with a Pi - surely an i7/i9/i11 can handle 30x that).
we need segwit for its data organizational changes, plus ability to move ~80% of transactions (eventually) off-chain. but we also need on-chain scaling.
bitcoin needs to be built for 10,000x its current usage in the long run, and 100,000,000x the usage if you believe it becomes a world currency. even with off-chain/lightning/sidechains, the onchain settlements will still demand much larger blocks

but if you are running a decent spv client, it will still see that the majority (if not all) of the network agrees on the blockchain. you're not just trusting one person's node - you can verify that many people agree its correct. AFAIK there hasnt been any attempts to attack bitcoin by distributing a fake ledger (not a hashrate attack, but an actual fake ledger with fake entries that date back months or years). 
IMO in the future full nodes will be run by telecoms/govs/corps/datacenters that can handle a 100TB+ blockchain, and 99% of users will have lightweight wallets.

a resurgence of bitcoin popularity could make the blocksize issue show up as soon as Q3-Q4 2015 - otherwise maybe not until Q1-Q2 2016.
IMO, the moving-targe method is a good way to bridge the distance between 1MB-&gt;20MB. A good implementation would see 10MB by the end of 2015, 20MB by the end of 2016, 40MB by the end of 2018, etc. 
-such that the size increases at a rate proportional to the average node bandwidth and the size of the ~1000 blocks beforehand
in most delevoped nations, 20MB can take 5-20 seconds to download. The bigger issue is developing nations where it might take upwards of a minute to download full blocks. (barrier to entry)

determining if a hardware purchase is a good idea is a totally different idea than what the OP claimed in the first sentence of their post:
"At the U.S. national average electric rate ($0.10Kwh), the most efficient miners available for purchase cannot even cover the cost of electricity now."
I absolutely stand by my conclusion that at the rate given ($0.10) and the btc value at the time ($215), equipment that was 1w/gh efficiency or better would produce enough bitcoin to cover the cost of electricity.
further to that, "most efficient miners available for purchase" would refer to either the Bitmain S5 (0.5w/GH) or the Spondoolies SP31 (0.3-0.4w/gh)
but if it makes you happy - I agree that right now there is no reason to buy equipment at the prices listed by either company. even if daily operation is profitable, ROI could take a very long time.

segwit is a great idea, but AFAIK its still being finetuned (it forked the testnet this week due to an easily-resolved bug), and deployment on the main network could expose it to more variables and surprises. testnet is needed for at least a few more weeks at minimum (IMO)
even once available, it wont be a fast rollout. maybe 25% acceptance within a month, 50% within 2-3, and 75% acceptance after 4 months. To reach full saturation could take 6+ months.

The benefits of operating with maximal licencing includes the high levels of regulations guidance and is fully backed&amp;insured for the end user.
The most vital takeaway is that this is an exchange that you can trust to actually hold your bitcoins and have the financial backing to replace them if lost, and the regulatory bodies to keep the exchange legit&amp;legal.
people who lost money in Gox had absolutely nothing near this type of consumer protection, yet the userbase was huge and the number of coins "stored" in Gox webwallets was uninsured.

apparently GAW was too stupid to think that people would try to flip coins at $20 day 1. when that happened, they made up some bullshit about the $20 floor not being reached because some evil bitcoiners were purposely dumping paycoin.

+1. one of the most important things about bitcoin is that it has already become a working ecosystem, and mining has been fairly dispersed.
a new coin that relies on POW would lead to a secondary ASIC revolution that favored large centralised backers. Thus far, 50% of all bitcoins have been dispersed quickly and evenly and via the price rise since have dispersed to a large number of users.
the other option is an airdropped currency, but obviously weve all seen how that went in the past with some altcoins. (auracoin, heh heh)

yeah, im quite sure its possible, for example 'find the 8-digit vote string' such that its position within the coinbase message is irrelevant (assuming it may have some 'junk' before or after it)
BIP109 makes a much cleaner way of identification in the versionbits though, which frees more room in the coinbase for other uses. Its not a huge step forwards, but it is a small improvement towards a better protocol which is what I like to see.
things like this, headers-first, CLTV, segwit, thinblocks, etc are all small but real steps towards a payment protocol that can become a backbone of the financial industry worldwide.

Theres alternatives. Physical bitcoins, mixing coins, paying from multiple wallets, etc. 
It would be easy to make a transaction that effectively requires subpoenas and financial accountants to figure out.
With a bit more work, it's possible to make it untraceable. 
IMO, the absolute best way is to control mining equipment. You can mine freshly minted bitcoins to brand-new addresses and spend however you want, so long as your pool does not correlate your ip address to the mining address (I'm not sure if any do - do any pools log the ip addresses on the stratum servers?)

Your math is seriously wrong.
1000GH = 1TH = 0.3431 BTC/month (at current diff)
1000W  = 1kW = $72.00/month (at $0.10/kwh)
1w/GH = [0.3431*$215]-$72 = $1.77/month (antminer S2, SP10)
0.7w/GH = [0.3431*$215]-[$72*0.7] = $23.37/month (Antminer S3, SP20 turbo, SP35)
0.5w/GH = $37.77/month (Antminer S5, SP20 econ, SP31)
0.4w/GH = $44.97/month (SP3X econ)
thats using legitimate numbers. I pay $0.12/kwh and have no other costs - I plan to turn off anything that uses &gt;1w/GH very soon if the price does not recover or the next difficulty period doesnt drop.
personally, i think the next diff change will be around -8% if the price does not increase soon. That will make some miners turn back on the 1w/GH gear.
not much new hardware will be produced or bought in this sort of market though, so difficulty and price will stagnate and begin following oneanother until significant price movement

not sure how you got that math. current size is 100GB (~40GB growth in the past year) and it synced within the day.
8mb blocks would give about 300-400GB/year if they were all filled.
maybe 3-4 days to sync a year of 8mb blocks. once its synced, you dont need to do it again.
at that point, there will be pre-verified (with hashes), compressed archives you can download to get a *recentish* blockchain, skip verifying those blocks, and then just download+verify the remainder until you are up to date

It's true, and called the "orphan rate" (probability that in the time it takes to relay a large block, a smaller one is solved and propagated more quickly)
Right now fees are ~0.5btc/block or ~2% of the mining reward. So as long as you have &lt;2% risk that a full block is orphaned, it makes sense to mine more txs to get the fees
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:56:29
95% is very excessive, and *perhaps* 75% isnt enough.  80-85% IMO is the ideal as thats a 4:1 or 5:1 ratio, a pretty clear majority, and te risk of it stalling out because a small andful of miners or a single pool doesnt make the switch is just silly.
as u/steb2k put it, 12 months is a lot. the 2MB code exists (and any other value could be subbed in (3MB, 4MB, etc) wit very little change to the PR. to say that devs need 3 months just to review a functioning code that already has ~4% miner support and ~20% node support, then waiting 12 months for laggards to make some pretty simple hardware/software tweaks isnt a good idea IMO.
im not a dev, so i could be generalizing, but I assume that the majority of implementations you mention (wallets, infrastructure) could very easily accept a larger block with very little modification other than to implement BIP109 or otherwise simply allow recognition of &gt;1mb blocks. It would only take a day or two for most to do this, and its probably massively simpler than what is required for segwit compatibility.
im fine with *assuming* it will take 12 months, but that should not be because of 95% requirements or by implementing a multi-month activation period once the consensus is reached. classic uses 75%/4 weeks, and I think requiring anything more than 85%/8weeks would be dissapointing.

Blocksonly solves only the issue of downloading transaction info between blocks, and does not address several things that thinblocks does:
1) "burst" bandwidth peak when a 1mb block is propagated through the network, requiring the node to download the full block and then upload the full block to others. Blocksonly offers zero improvement here
2) blocksonly means that a node does not see (or propagate) unconfirmed transactions, only blocks. Therefore it's completely useless for zero-conf
Thinblocks allows you to effectively 'build' blocks based on what transactions are included (most of which are already in the node's mempool), and reduces the 'apparent blocksize' from 1mb to as little as 20-50kb.

really? There was about an entire week where XPY traded at a relatively firm $5-8 range, and anyone renting out mining rigs to those who wanted to mine paycoin were recieving compensation for the mining that was more or less equivelent to a $6 XPY value
a lot of people were paying for bitcoin miners to mine XPY, and the cost to rent the SHA256 miners was based closely on the paycoin exchange rate at the time ~$6.50.
Not all of the people beleived in the insane "$20 floor" promise, but to see XPY down to around $3 hits the ball home. My guess is that GAW made hyped the coin and provided the insanely small round of POW in order to utilise thier own SHA256 miners for self profit.
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:52:36
My greatest concern would be the delay for smaller miners in getting new work (orphans). If the time from chain-&gt;pool-&gt;miner takes 1200-3600ms they are effectively missing out on 2-6% of the mining time for that block. This given *more* advantage to larger farms with fiber connections over the little guy on dialup/dsl
something like a 2min blocktime would offer a more balanced improvement, but still require devlopment of faster sidechains where faster confirmations are desired

The benefits of operating with maximal licencing includes the high levels of regulations guidance and is fully backed&amp;insured for the end user.
The most vital takeaway is that this is an exchange that you can trust to actually hold your bitcoins and have the financial backing to replace them if lost, and the regulatory bodies to keep the exchange legit&amp;legal.
people who lost money in Gox had absolutely nothing near this type of consumer protection, yet the userbase was huge and the number of coins "stored" in Gox webwallets was uninsured.

there's extremes on both sides.
the blocksize issue has been heavily discussed for two years now with very little to show for it (so far - though plenty of ideas are in development still) and within the last 6 months we've seen the limit being hit regularly and fees beginning to increase as a result.
so i think there is reason to start viewing it as an increasingly important issue, even though it may be a few months from "urgent" or "critical"
i think theres as much FUD about the system running out of space and failing as there is FUD about larger blocks breaking the network or causing more centralisation. But thats the nature of any debate (look at the election for example), and cooler heads will see that somewere in the middle is the truth and a valid compromise
IMO the core roadmap is pretty good, though perhaps a bit "slow". If they fail to produce good segwit benefits within the next 3-6 months though i expect the classic/2mb hardfork to keep gaining support and activating near the end of this year.

theres always been 4 basic scenarios:
1) satoshi has lost or destroyed the keys to those initial bitcoin in hopes of improving rather than crashing the price. keep in mind satoshi would likely have a large number of bitcoins in any case, that noone links to him/her/them
2) satoshi plans to airdrop or otherwise disperse the coins. This would really be a bullish thing for bitcoin, but capable of destabilising the currency. If it doesnt occur in the next 4 years it would likely crash the currency if it affected the "realistic" market cap.
3) satoshi will sit on it like a king for ever and ever, or give it to a singular heir. It will be spent slowly, but unless spent rashly would likely be a slow trickle into the economy. not a terrible thing but obviously would be like the next-century rothschild
4) they are filtered directly back into bitcoin via mining fees or any future emergency when major new liquidity is required for stability.

So you are against *having options* unless they somehow have public acceptance already?

15% of total hashrate would be about 35% of the weak chain (15/15+25) which is enough to have a significantly good chance of successful attacks.
Any sign of attack would likely 'spook' more miners away from the weak chain, making a 15% hashrate attack progressively more powerful against the weakest chain.
All this assumes that the 25% weak chain maintains that 25% hashrate. Realistically, the forking would result in most of the 'holdouts' changing to the longest blockchain, and that 25% would probably shrink to 10-15% within a few days and be completely abandoned within a month because of rapidly weakening hashrate
I therefore think 75% is a fair activation trigger, but perhaps 1000 blocks is not enough. Maybe 2000 blocks would be more certainty. Assuming the fork doesn't occur immediately, there would be a warning period of a few days or weeks during which holdouts *should make the switch

What's with coinbase hate? They are a financial institution that has made every effort to meet regulations so that they can offer easy trading of bitcoins with simple user experience and tethering to bank accounts for direct transfers.
To say they are anti-bitcoin or would try to take down the currency that keeps them in business is naive. Saying they lack a dev team is almost equally arbitrary.
I don't know why my situation of 100x growth (let's say by 2025) is bad for on chain scaling. By that time bandwidth will be ~16x what it is today, validation times will improve with better coding, and features like segwit and thinblocks will both smooth and reduce the amount of data most nodes download. If blocks are 40mb (with another ~40mb segwit) that would be pretty reasonable, and I'm sure sidechain/offchain services will be necessary anyways.

the "node vote" is pretty meaningless though wen nodes show up out of nowhere. miners are whats important, and it stands at 5% right now.
Imo core isnt wrong - they have some good ideas and valid reasons to oppose the blocksize (not including any claimed blockstream "oversight") 
i dont want 2mb to trigger today - i expect it to be a slow process of gaining miner acceptance. most people agree tat the size needs to increase, and there is some vauge consensus that 2MB is a reasonable increase thats tecnically feasible.
it will likely take miners monts to switch over, even if it was a btc/core 2mb hardfork client. I forsee it reaching 10-20% consensus by the time segwit is available, and with the reduced 'urgency' it will probably take much of a year to attain the remaining consensus.
in other words, btc/core is in a situation where they need to provide scaling answers (likely as segwit) in the short term (before the halving), or the support for raising maxblocksize will continue to gain concensus. 
As bitcoin grows, I fully expect it to become much more dynamic and capable of implementing hard/soft forks more easily, such as using BIP109 to propose and form separate consensus on multiple hardfork changes under the same versionbits. This logic allows you to see that classic can be allowed to exist even if it takes several years for the bitcoin network to reach consensus on 2MB, while allowing other updates with better consensus to be voted on and implemented at their own speed.

Blocksonly removes the ability to monitor unconfirmed transactions though, and reduces the effectiveness of them propagating the network. It's a horrendous 'alternative' to thinblocks

Thinblocks is a simple and effective solution

From a trading point of view - it could look bearish in the short term. There's squabbling, a poor network of communications between users, and a ton of different, uncomparable solutions to the issue.
Longterm for both dev and trading, its a great thing. Every year that bitcoin becomes a little larger it has growing pains like this. As long as the issue is overcome and agreed on a solution, it is only beneficial
personally, im torn between an algorithm (its math and should not need to ever be changed again) and a change to 10-20MB (temporary solution that could become an issue again in 2-4 years)

Simple fact is that almost any code change can be done with a soft fork, but doing so tends to leave the network 'disjointed' and older clients will fail to be able to create or read/validate (?) blocks &gt;1mb.
This is the same as soft-fork segwit, where segwit transactions can't be made or understood without the update.
A hardfork might be better for both, but the hard/soft debate is entirely seperate from the size/segwit debate
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:49:08






referring to his recent proposal for difficulty adjustment at te halving:


The fact is that luke-jr is a strongly-opinionated person (see his post history for an extremist catholic reddit participation) who is unable to run a node (another post admits that rising blocksize means it affects his home network) and feels that 1MB blocks are already big enough (or even too big)
pair with an expectation of near-impossible consensus, and it becomes clear how hardforks with 95% or higher consensus can be blocked by a small minority that has sub-par network connections.

if you add a node to an area where there are many users but few nodes, you can greatly improve the bandwidth and network for that area.

firstly, I think deploying one capacity change per hardfork is the right thing to do, since werve seen how much infighting XT caused by combining BIP101 with other 'features'. BIP101 support was greater than the XT support as a result, and nothing was achieved.
secondly, the points provided are correct - segwit is a much more complex code change that includes a new type of 'secondary data block' and entirely new methods of creating transactions that could take months to gain traction for day-to-day use by wallets. The idea is still good and could provide real benefits, but it cant simply be rushed into when it only just went live on the testnet and they talk about soft fork deployment of something so major. In comparison, the effects of larger blocks (be it 2mb, 8mb, or 20mb) have been researched and exposed to the testnet for at least the past 2-3 years (the blocksize discussion dates back to early 2013), and a 2mb cange is very simple and has comparatively little complexity for software designers (change "1mb" to "2mb" to allow more transactions)
third, why does a hardfork need a year? its a vote-trigger mechanism. If miners vote for it with the required majority (75% or 90%) thats a strong show of support, and the resulting 4-week countdown is sufficient for well-informed users to make the simple changes in their software to accept blocks that eventually exceed 1mb.
Finally, this 'soft fork is better' mentality is flawed. a 'good" hardfork is implemented ONCE a pre-defined support level is reached (higher is better for consensus), whereas a soft fork simply slips in an update and forces everyone to update (almost like windows 10). 2mb can be softforked in if that makes you think its safer, just like segwit could be hardforked in. The difference is whether you beleive the update requires some form of voting.
as such, segwit softwork could lead to a serious network fork if it fails to garner enough support from miners and nodes who refuse to include that type of transaction in a block

theres over 1Exohash in the network. assuming its made up of gear priced similarly to the bitmain S5/S7, its worth (today) somewhere around $152 Million (2.5-3% of entire market cap for bitcoin). This does not include another ~25 Million worth of infrastructure required in the process, or the value of outdated hardware. keep in mind that a market cap is largely hypothetical value and can change drastically with the price (2 months ago an exohash was worth ~$200 Million, which was nearly 7% of the $3B market cap

When will core increase either the maxblocksize, or implement a fully-tested safe-to-implement segwit? Probably a year or more...
Meanwhile, bitcoin classic will likely be based on core 0.12, so besides majority forking rules the two clients are identical up to the point of forking (will take at least 2-3 months likely)
@_date: 2016-01-21 20:01:00
Or you could simply look at the github of the project, and compare core and classic directly based on actual code changes.
The "goal" of classic is to be 1-1 identical to core (ideally the 0.12 version rather than 0.11.2), with the singular addition of coding to allow a hardfork to 2mb procedure if 75% of hashrate support 2mb
*IF a 75% super majority agrees that a fork to2mb should occur (which is 3:1 consensus), btc-core would have 4 weeks to either plan for how to deal with being a minority fork, or put out a 2mb version so that compatibility with the longest blockchain is maintained. If core follows to 2mb (the rational decision if you want consensus), then classic is a success,and segwit will provide additional benefits 
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:36:42
Then you assume that the small fork users are only interested in a settlement layer and not for semi-rapid payment processing
@_date: 2016-01-01 00:52:23
what? what happens in altcoinland is mostly unrelated, and the price drop has been mostly due to bitcoin becoming the 'dominant cryptocurrency'
but look at sha256 altcoins - they are pretty much extinct because the bitcoin network is the most profitable use of mining hashrate. When competing interests are introduces, that balance changes.
look at the paycoin (XPY) mining blitz that lasted something like two weeks. because XPY difficulty was low and XPY/USD was &gt;$6 (never got near the $20 promise), something like 15-20% of bitcoin hashrate was diverted for mining a more profitable SHA256 coin.
if bitcoin forks, miners will choose what is most profitable. commonsense would suggest that bigger blocks = more transactions which is competing against the 'fee market' comcept of arbitrarily limiting blockspace. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:48:45
you make it sound like this fork is happening for no reason and with little support (or accidental support?).
miners are smart, they are economically incentivized to do whats in thier best interests. let the hashrate "vote" and see where the cards fall.
if 75% support bigger blocks, tat makes you in the minority. if that happens, would you consider updating your client to handle 2mb or  are you stubborn enough to go down with the ship?
why is it so hard to understand that 3:1 is a clearcut majority? we dont know if 2mb has 75% support yet, and even if it does the resulting fork is still at least 1.5-2 months away MINIMUM

@_date: 2016-03-10 16:38:02
Not initially, no. In fact, doubling max block size could cause a 20-40% drop in fees potentially. This assumes miners don't establish minimum fee rules
But after a few months the fees will be right back to where they were and have room to grow.

whats wrong wit a proposal? how on earth do you expect the bitcoin network to reach consensus without having options?

@_date: 2016-03-13 19:17:55
its common sense actually. everything related to the bitcoin network is constantly improving:
bandwidth, storage drives, cpu/ram/ssd speeds, signature validation methods, thinblocks/relay/segwit/etc, and many more.
To think that in the past 6 years the capabilities of computers has not improved to the point that bigger blocks can be handled, you are crazy.
give me one reason in which scaling on-chain isnt possible if all te above capabilities continue to improve year by year?
i mean, in 2009 netflix was still mailing DVDs because many lacked the bandwidth to stream online content
@_date: 2016-01-21 11:23:49
you think segwit will be ready and deployed via soft fork in a month?
*meanwhile, everyone seems to be losing thier minds that a 2mb hard fork could occur as soon as 2-3 months from now (once it reaches the supermajority condition, theres a 4 week countdown to the rule change)
segwit seems like a great idea, but in concept AND coding, its about 10x more complex than a simple blocksize ADJUSTMENT
@_date: 2016-03-31 03:34:16
TLDR: signatures are a big part of the transaction data (and a majority of it in complex multisig transactions), and segwit stores them in a separate "secondary block". This means improvements in validation speeds and block relay because you can avoid downloading data you did not need

@_date: 2016-01-24 14:54:21
well, we could do something very easy:
1) create an alternative client that has only one difference - a 2MB fork (IN PROCESS)
2) allow miners to cast cryptogrpahically verified "votes" in the form of hashrate.
3) see if the 75% (or possibly 90%) majority requirements are reached.
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:01:46
5nm semiconducters are expected by 2021. Thats about 4x better efficiency on a hardware level in the next 4-5 years. beyond that, a major jump in process is required but definitely not impossible.
and moore's law is only a part of it. bandwidth will continue to evolve logarithmically to the speed of light, and 128bit programming, faster ram, faster SSD drives, will all enable fastert computing
Perhaps not in the form of moore's law, but i expect computing power to continue improving by nearly 44%/year for several decades, perhaps manifesting primarily in AI research (due to inherent size constraints)
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:23:28
Why? *if classic makes a 2mb fork then common sense dictates that core should follow (unless they do that idiotic PoW change)
Once core, classic, and whatever other clients all use 2mb, you can put your support back wherever you like.  
Btc-classic knows that changes are it's hurdles, so expect it to make only one at a time, while ensuring 99.9% core compatibility otherwise

@_date: 2016-01-17 15:44:16


what rock are you living under? In the past week we have seen a majority of miners supporting 2MB bitcoin classic. When software is available, it could reach &gt;50% usage within a month, and trigger a fork within 2-3 months at most.

It helps pull the lead away from Bitmain/Antminer.

@_date: 2016-03-10 14:50:28
1) who's using relay? Afaik it's really just for miners. Thinblocks offers benefits to all nodes
2) how is zero-conf useless? It might be insecure due to doublespending risks, but if you have *some* trust in the sender, it acts as verification that the payment was sent and is waiting for confirmation. I'd say it's extremely useful, even if you plan to wait for 1+ confirmations anyways.
Thinblocks is a pretty simply add-on for the client, and could be set to be opt-in/out just like the 'blocksonly' flag. Look at bitcoin unlimited for a client that implements the thinblocks option, where block propagation is improved by only needing 10-50kb thinblocks when a new block is solved.
@_date: 2016-03-13 18:40:55
pretty easy to assume improvements in: Bandwidth, Drive Storage, CPU/RAM, signature validation methods, thinblocks/relay/etc that eliminate the "burst bandwidth", the list goes on.

@_date: 2016-03-17 16:32:09
your idea of voting is non-participation. thats not a vote, thats changing protocols entirely and no longer being a part of the bitcoin network.
as such, miners have incentive to preserve network userbase - if not to improve it.
 Miners would not choose to accept/decline a rule change if they were certain it would lead to this. which means it is still THEIR VOTE.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:46:48
so two improvements used together break the system? i can tink of at least a few reasons otherwise:
1) core 0.12 introduces MUCH faster transaction verification (and thus relay)
2) miners and nodes can choose not to mine/accept blocks &gt;X MB
4) other than a few fringe cases and trying to propagate trough the slow chinese firewall, blocks as large as 20MB could probably work. 3.5-4MB is fairly trivial, and several issues with the GFW can be resolved by miners using stratum proxies located outside china, or possibly other metods of VPN/satellite
5) it will take at least 6 months to have segwit and 2MB, and at that point its unlikely segwit will afford more than a 50% boost (since estimates give it 70-100% gain at full userbase integration). Thats about a 3MB effective size, maybe 3.5-4MB after a full year. by then, bandwidth and computing are expected to improve by 20-40% over what they are today.
6) mining big blocks increases the orpan risk, and miners will naturally find a tradeoff that likely doesnt mean full blocks (if there were even 3-4Mb of transactions/block at that time, which there probably wont be)

@_date: 2016-03-17 17:25:22
no reason it isnt.
maybe not directly through the UI, but a miner could likely change a single line in the code to change "30s" to something that suits their needs.
realistically a 1MB block might take &lt;10s to propagate on a fast network, but maybe 20s+ if travelling through the GFW. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 00:38:06

Of course, it was a trivial bug and that's what testnet is for, but it still demonstrates that segwit isn't ready quite yet.

Oops - 7 days, you're right.
I agree that it's a fairly tight timeframe and would prefer something like 80% for 2 weeks (1600/2000 blocks) for the reasons you gave.
However, if 75% of hashrate has switched (or is faking - a silly method of attack, like going on TV to say who you are going to vote for, and then doing different at the polling station) that's a clear majority. Assume to that a certain contingent of miners may support the change but simply not bother to use the modified node/client software, and would willingly switch over quickly once a 75% majority was obvious.
There is a lot of economic incentive to be on the longest chain. Miners have very little reason to screw around with faking blockversion or avoiding a switch to majority software

Not at all. If the block reward is soon 12.5btc (~$5500, or &gt;$600,000/day), and algorithm will be deployed on massive scale using the cheapest hardware with optimum efficiency and power density, where it's cheapest.
Imagine an algorithm that uses cpu, hdd, AND ram. Crafty miners will deploy server mobos that can handle multiple cpus (many can handle 4x quad-core xeon) and have 16+ ram slots using the cheapest components with good energy efficiency. Within a few weeks, you will see 80%+ of the hashrate is located in china at facilities that have racks and racks of these boards setup with simplified controls, cheap power, and components produced locally that are far cheaper.   So now your $500 mining pc with 3ghz quad core and 16gb ram is competing with a $600 server that has 4x those specs, and access to &lt;$0.05/kwh power.

I'm fairly technical-minded, and I am against RBF because:
1) It expands the 'reach' of doublespending attacks
2) It takes a vulnerability that required technical capability to implement, and makes it into an extremely simplified user-facing feature.
3) doublespending/RBF should not be needed if wallet fee settings are 'intelligent'/adaptive to begin with. Commonsense dictates low/zero-fee transactions could take hours to confirm, and setting a higher/optimal fee will ensure next block.

luke-jr's "patch" is just to change the PoW mechanism. Its low-level trolling from someone who thinks the blocksize should be 500kb
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:01:07
lets take a 75% (3:1) hardfork requirement for example:
75% of miners are mining with a 2mb 'vote', which triggers a 4-week countdown to activation. Within theat 4 weeks it expected that the minority of the network will update to software versions that can handle the upcoming &gt;1mb blocks (very simple update)
When the fork occurs, you will see one chain with &gt;75% hashrate and anothier with &lt;25%. Obviously the weaker chain will be vulnerable to hashrate attacks and in this case changing PoW could be an attempted "course correction"
however, a new algorithm will lead to a new generation of custom hardware and/or ASICs, running in massive bulk deployment wherevere power is cheap. It would centralize more than SHA256 has, within a span of months
Realistically, the fork is supposed to be temporary, and by the time of activation almost everyone should have switched over. Otherwise its like getting outvoted 3-1 and stubbornly refusing out of a sense of self-importance.

classic is a show of support for 2MB. if classic gains significant attention (which is is doing), it becomes prudent for btc/core to adopt 2MB as well.

the argument for raising the limit is hat it allows:
- more transactions per second (currently the network is limited to ~5tps at peak, and perhaps 7tps if everyone used only basic transactions)
- the 1mb current maxblocksize was established about 6 years ago when it was uncommon to see a block &gt;100kb in size, and was implemented as a filter against spam or zero-fee transactions
- bandwith and cpu speeds both follow similar curves, more than doubling every two years. as such, its reasonable to assume that the limit can increase over time at a similar pace (however, validating blocks appears to be a bottleneck right now, AFAIK)
- some people beleive that bitcoin usage will grow massively from this point if its to be used by more people and on a regular basis. In theory, transaction volume grows exponentially against the number of users.
- right now, blocks are often full or near capacity 
arguments against raising include:
- not changing "the rules" or otherwise changing something thast could result in immediate change to how fees are calculated (would be lower presumably if there is more space)
- higher bandwidth usage and processing requirements
- other solutions (such as segwit) are underway (but still require extensive testing)
- there is not unanimous support
- some peopel beleive that the blockchain will only handle highvalue transactions, and "day to day" stuff will operate on seperate "sidechains" (which are still months or more from being reviewed, tested, and implemented)
My personal opinion is that 2mb should not pose a problem, and segwit or sidechain implementations added to that in the future will make bitcoin very robust.
@_date: 2016-03-05 17:56:19
something like thinblocks would drastically alleviate the issue by allowing a 2MB block to be rapidly assembled and relayed from the mempool, meaning each new block only requires nodes to handle a 20-60kb "burst" (&gt;90% less than relaying a full block)
@_date: 2016-03-16 03:06:32
Miners absolutely vote on code changes by mining with the relevant block version or client.
@_date: 2016-01-10 11:26:09
core is the mob forcing bitcoin to change path.
up until now, there has always been sufficient blockspace that low-fee transactions can quickly make it into the next block. Full blocks and high fees were virtually unheard of.
In the past 4 months we have seen a LOT of full blocks, and that the majority (you remember that this means &gt;50%?) are more than 80% full on a regular basis.
The natural response should be to provide more space for data in a block, preserving the status-quo. Instead, Core is resistant to blocksize increase, wanting to "create a fee market", and simultaneously using softforks (which are potentially worse than hardforks as they can go undetected) to create a far more complicated method of including additional data anyways.
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:16:59
SegWit requires everyone to use segwit wallets and even then, the actual size increase is likely 1.5-2x, not 4x unless using advanced features.
segwit is a good idea, but will not be sufficient on its own. I *still* support a 2MB blocksize now, and segwit implemented once its thouroughly tested in a few months

i feel it can increase too quickly (as fast as 2x every 45days), though tats extremely unlikely

@_date: 2016-03-22 00:35:14
I think that segwit will occur first and slow down the drive to roll out a 2mb fork (by classic or core), but if segwit isn't available soon then classic and other 2+mb clients will continue to snowball support and activate by the end of the year
I don't see classic as win/lose - the mere fact that it creates a way for miners to 'vote' is the real success, regardless of the outcome. 
@_date: 2016-03-19 20:36:56
maybe thats because the only goal of classic right now is to include a 2MB hardfork consensus code on the oterwise fantastic btc/core development
not sure how that makes the contribution of classic "zero", because its enabled miners and node operators to demonstrate that they support increasing the blocksize to 2MB. (currently, about 5% of hasrate agrees with this)
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:30:23

@_date: 2016-03-15 17:13:16


you dont need evidence, you just need the basic fact tat certain people work in private companies with the same software (bitcoin) as they provide direct open-source development roles on. Several employees of Blockstream (though not the company itself) are in obvious conflict of interest by working in a paid position for a company with specific ideas of bitcoin while also acting as core developers on the open-source project.
just because it is a conflict of interest does not make it unethical, illegal, or wrong. The fact that it exists though should not go unmentioned, as it is important for those less familiar to recognise.
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:52:52
There was a general show of support for 2-4-8, primarily from the same groups as voiced support for classic's simple 2mb compromise
Without a cryptographic proof-of-choice/vote it will be difficult to truly tally support for different choices, but there has been a lot of unlock agreement with a smaller 2mb increase (and following with 4-8 over a span of a few years makes sense)
@_date: 2016-03-22 06:01:48
Amen to that.
Regardless of 75% or 95% consensus requirements, I think too many people became irrationally afraid that somehow there would gain that much support *too soon/too quickly*, when miners would likely act in the opposite.
Just look at the fact that classic 0.12 and core 0.12 have similar adoption rates because most miners and nodes use earlier versions that function just fine and may not be upgrade unless there is a very good reason (such as segwit or bandwidth improvements, as examples). 
@_date: 2016-01-14 00:34:48
If there is a fork where 3/4 of the hashrate is dedicated to one chain, the other becomes immensely vulnerable to 51% attacks and other methods of hashrate attack/abuse.
As such, 75% represents a major tipping point where a single entity with with &gt;15% of the total sha256 hashrate could pose a serious threat to the minority blockchain

IMO segwit+2mb is the way forward, but both should be separate hardfork codes with ~80% consensus requirement so they can trigger in either order.

Segwit is a far more complex code change than a simple block size growth. 
2mb now, and in a few months segwit might be ready for use. At that point it can be used alongside 2mb to get a ~4mb effective limit, suitable for growth

This. If a form happens it is caused by75% hashrate support for classic (making core the smaller hashrate), followed by 4weeks period before activation so everyone can update thier clients/nodes to handle the upcoming &gt;1mb blocks 
If &lt;75% of hashrate supports classic,it won't fork. Just like XT never forked.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:37:38
But at &gt;90%, it really all circles back around to "you're the odd one out, everybody else in the [class]room wants to do this, so suck it up and try not to cry"
I think 75% is okay, 80-85% would be ideal. 90% is extremely tough when there are opposition who are adament in thier position, and 95% could make it impossible if some miner(s) simply don't care enough to take action (regardless of actual 1mb or 2mb preference)
@_date: 2016-03-20 20:53:21
What are you talking about - how is it a lie?
As for dropping the RBF, I'm neutral on that. Rbf has potential but isn't particularly useful unless blocks are completely full and fees significantly change or become much less predictable
And head-first mining is a great thing, as it makes a huge step forwards from simply SPV mining when the full block isn't available. There's no reason why the vast majority of miners wouldn't implement it.
All you've been calling out for months is that somehow having an alternative client is going to destroy bitcoin, when it provides an opportunity for the exact opposite effect of allowing software 'voting', which will improve further with implementation of bip109

But my point is that it still centralises to where power is cheap, hardware is inexpensive (ideally made locally to reduce shipping) , and solutions for high power density and minimal oversight are envisioned.
Ie: a memory-hard also could result in a custom PCB that has upwards of 200gb ram soldered directly to it and costs less to produce than buying ~32gb of ddr desktop ram, let alone needing only 1 controller.
Changing also might be 10x worse in the long run

@_date: 2017-03-20 01:18:38
you cant fake it, thats the point.
the common measurement is last 1000 blocks (1 week) or 144 blocks (1day). BU has 320/1000 blocks and 62/144 daily blocks
but variance can easily mean +/-10%
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:57:36


this is why all this FUD is annoying. anything less than a clear supermajority (3:1 ratio at 75% or 4:1 at 80%) would be harmful to bitcoin's value and hurt miners. BU has ~30% right now and it could easily take many more months to double that.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:30:45
Such as shame that they are prominent miners with a successful facility. Huh? /s
Does it matter who's in charge when the code is open source? Once btc-classic is released you can examine every part of it (though 2mb is supposed to be the main/only change) and decide whether to support 1mb or 2mb
Devs are great, and open source is a great way for them all to work together even if they have differing directions and ideas

It is logical that spv and Web wallets will be a big thing as bandwidth and storage demands rise (and likely outpace moore's law). But consider that cable/dsl is improving and being quickly replaced by fiber connections in a lot of areas.
Right now most people have 1-20 Mbps (~0.15-3MBps) and having &gt;20Mbps on a home connection is reasonably common (or at least available) in major cities. That will probably scale up very quickly when you consider that 10 years ago it took as long to download a small mp3 (~3MB) as it now takes to download a TV show (300MB).

"less stalwart defenders"? i think what he want is developers who are able to see the issue and want to provide on-chain scaling.
right now, there is serious concern that parts of the btc/core development are being dragged out because btc/core and blockstream view a future where sidechains (like LN) provide all the user experience, leaving bitcoin as settlement layer. I dont have issues with sidechains, but if you can't see the conflict of interest where a sidechain company is strongly against on-chain scaling (except where it benefits the sidechain, such as segwit) you are blind.
the conflict of interest is not inherently bad, but it has the potential for misuse and I dont think that core/blockstream are open and honest enough about that.
bitcoin as a long way to go. even with segwit and sidechains, the network would be limited by the mainchain blocksize. If bitcoin succeeds, it should expect a 10-fold to 100-fold increase in users and daily transactions, in part through on-chain scaling such as a simple doubling of blocksize

you seem to miss the fact that a 90% consensus would be a 9-1 vote.

@_date: 2016-01-26 00:37:03
firstly, blocks are very near full and bitcoin has not even seen any major (&gt;100% in 6 months) adoption cycle since 2013. 
1.75mb from segwit could take several months to complete the coding for and deploy via a softfork (which I disagree with - hard forks are a key function for such significant changes to how the bitcoin code sends transactions), and then have users start sending specialty transactions through it. realistically it would take about 2 months to be ~1.3mb effective and at least 6 months before &gt;1.7mb effective.
I think both ideas are great options for scaling, and BOTH may be required to scale bitcoin to a global userbase that could handle thousands of transactions per second. However, 2mb is a much cleaner, safer change than to do a massive code change for segwit, which only just entered testnet
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:47:25
BU has its own consensus rules annd nodes though. its not like BU miners have no means of propogating thier blocks - there are enough miners and nodes to allow it to be a growing chain.
which then falls back to 'longest chain' theory. ie: "whatever chain has the most hashrate is the most secure". if either fork could be 51% by just a minority of miners on the other chain, it becomes fragile and will lose value
@_date: 2016-01-21 13:59:20
How does a 2mb classic 'force feed bip101'?
Maybe you mean after the fork to 2mb, they will put out a newer version with bip101 fork rules. If so, that would be an entirely seperate fork procedure and isn't 'force fed' by any means 
Unless they used soft fork, since that's infinitely closer to a 'force feeding' than a hardfork is

Fork potential is only the potential when a clear majority (3:1) is using that rule set.

That's a stupid plan, any new algorithm would be immediately implemented with specialised equipment such as ASICS, or at least deployed in huge scale on server grade equipment.

It's not just a magical 75%, it's 750/1000 last blocks mined (approx 10,000 minutes or 70 days) which is a large chunk of time to eliminate variability concerns and the fork implementation could be avoided by miners STOPPING thier mining of the fork rules. 
Ie: there's about 80% hash power support seen over a span of ~800 blocks. To prevent the fork occurring ~20% of the hash power could switch back to core rules and it's likely that 750/1000 blocks would not be achieved. (such as a scenario where a problem in forking becomes obvious after a month or more of miners using the new rules)

I do not consider this OR casascius to be cold storage. The trust requirement makes them insecure, and storing large amounts on them is just silly as a result. Buy aluminum cryptocards or a trezor for your cold storage so that you know only you control the private key, and can load or offload the balance without physically destroying the peice

The key thing IMO is that as these across-the-board improvements occur, and userbase *presumably* grows, there should be a sort of blocksize equilibrium. hard-fork step changes are just a can-kick and beyond 2Mb there needs to be a defined growth rate, or algorithm similar to difficulty

Interested parties will have a few weeks at minimum to make the upgrades
People who don't follow closely will start seeing alerts in their software when a fork occurs
People who simply don't pay attention won't be affected since held coins will be valid in new/old chains simultaneously. It's not like failing to update will lose your bitcoins
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:43:48
Why isn't it an option? Look at the code, and classic does three key things:
1) based on 0.11.2 code (and should be modified to be based on a duplicate of 0.12 shortly). In this regard it's functionally identical to btc-core
2) implement a rule that if 75%+ of miners use classic it will trigger a 4wk countdown to a 2mb hardfork. Not a major change and would be based on a clear consensus mechanism (voting with hashrate). If 75% isn't reached, there's no fork
3) a different dev team. Whatever your stance on devs, having more than one team/implementation is a good thing (did someone say decentralize?)
This isn't like XT which pushed to implement multiple changes at once - its a clear and simple method of allowing miners to vote whether or not they support 2mb blocks.
Last I checked, btc-core has never bothered to make this an option or otherwise allow miners to vote with verified hashrate. Just conference panels and vague lists of who does/doesnt support specific changes. If Noone wants 2mb it won't happen. BUT... what if &gt;75% of the hashrate does?
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:18:03
I can't understand the level of FUD that implies a fork will happen before/without a 75% super majority AND the resulting 4-week period before activation.
If 75% moves, that is consensus, or at least a 3:1 support compared to core. If &lt;75% moves a fork will never happen and btc-classic will operate seamlessly with btc-core (which it's virtually a duplicate of) on the same chain.

Scaling should be a hardfork procedure, not a softfork forced change.
That btc-core thinks segwit can/should be a soft fork when criticizing a lack of consensus by classic  seeking to gain a 75% majority hardfork is backwards-thinking
@_date: 2016-03-17 16:10:59
thats true for your client, but not the blockchain.
If 100% of miners change their code [such that blocks mined with it are not visible/acceptable by your specific client] it will have the result that your client becomes useless and unable to participate in the main chain.
the software that miners choose to run, or more precisely *the rules they follow*, determines which transactions can be included in the next block on the longest blockchain. As such it can also include consensus mechanisms on how to change the rules (such as  how classic enables miners to CHOOSE to mine with a software that VOTES to make a very specific code change under majority agreement)
same goes for segwit. its not a *forced* change like a hardfork, but the concept is the same. If miners decided NOT to mine segwit transactions it could effectively vote to *disable* a code change, and your client that is in disagreement becomes useless as its unable to be part of the longest blockchain

thats not how this works. AFAIC, "contentious" stops being a thing at a 3:1 majority, and is absolutely disproven at 9:1. 
ps: read the actual info about segwit, and you will notice that they seem to voice opposition to a hasty segwit softfork. If the article is true, it means something like &gt;70% o the hashrate control OPPOSES a deployment of segwit this year (or at least until after 2mb).  That makes segwit a CONTENTIOUS soft fork
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:21:01

Maybe because he directly quoted the whitepaper?
In the event of a fork, the longest chain is considered the valid chain. Even if core miners consider it an altcoin, the transition of majority hashrate would lend security to the fork and make the original core chain less secure to miner attacks

its hard to determine whats controversial without being able to vote for or against it.
thats like saying elections are controversial, so a distatorship is better. (of course, they have different 'activation thresholds")
what if there was a client who, similar to classic, wanted to raise the blocksize, but only to a reasonable 1.1MB? Is this controversial enough that it simply should not be used? why, because YOU *think* 75% (or 95%) of people dont support it? 
@_date: 2016-01-21 19:20:55
Only because of softfork, which isn't *forwards-compatible.
You could softfork 2mb and a transaction in a &gt;1mb blocks would be about as compatible as a transaction done via softfork segwit (only to whoever updates)
Soft forks are basically hard forks without a consensus requirement 
@_date: 2016-01-14 15:28:15
That might be fine for your personal through process, but 75% of the hashrate can be attributed to a few dozen key miners and pool operators. Those are the people who will be actively discussing or demonstrating thier position
If bitcoin mining is a serious job or source of income you will want to act on your opinions. Those who only have to few antminer running are the ones less likely to act, because for ~$10/day who cares about spending hours on the specifics of something you have a 0.01% say in? (it's like voting, but with economic incentive)
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:29:52
not if the vast majority of SHA-256 hashrate follows it. if either chain has &lt;25% of the global hashrate it would be susceptible to attack and quickly die off.
thats also why BU cant fork anytime soon - they really need to have significantly more than 51% (ideally 70%+) of the hashrate

thats like saying a new cellphone carrier (compatible with 4G but actively promoting a future with 5G/6G) is mobile network terrorism.
classic and core will play nice together until 75% of hashrate (a 3:1 economic majority) is using classic for 7+ days in a row (750/1000 blocks)
its not like running classic will immediately fork the network. It takes time for hashrate to move and minds to change. Plenty of time for core to decide if they need to introduce code that would accept a 2MB block if/when it happens

core has not made any outwards efforts to compromise on the blocksize. they rumored about 2mb following segwit, but thats clearly still a while away.
there was no reason why core cant release a 2mb code that has a 95% threshold, at least as a sign of goodwill. instead, segwit is still the primary solution from them and largely because it would help enable blockstream's lightning layer (which is a good idea, but scaling is needed on chain too)
smart miners know BU is in no position to fork unless it has a supermajority of hashrate (&gt;75% IMO). thats a ways off still, yet look at the giant FUDstorm produced by those fearing a contentious fork in the near future.

We are still at a point where the $/btc value will presumably grow massively in relation to bitcoin growth/utility. Combine with the fact that miners can (and often do) ignore no-fee/low-fee transactions or spam based on thier independent filtering practices and that the reward will be 12.5btc for the next 4 years while fees slowly grow from the current ~0.5/block (without fee market outside of occasional full block periods). 
If block size was increased 10-fold, without any increase in bitcoin value or fees, to match a 10x increase in transactions we would see reward quickly approaching fees in regard to miner income.

It's likely that large scale miners have multiple nodes and/or stratum servers set up.
If the mining hardware isn't getting response from the bu node, it should be able to simply fall back to the 2nd or 3rd stratum server (be it a local core node, or a mining pool that's functioning fine)
I can't see this causing losses, other than a few seconds of time waiting for a reply from the node.l, and then switching to another connection that is unharmed.
Imo this is the reason why multiple clients are a good thing, because you never know if core will suddenly be shown to have a similar vulnerability and cause 80% of nodes to be crashed.

You also need to account for people playing the market, trying to create (and profit from) huge swings in the btu/bcc exchange ratio. 
I personally made ~25% in the first two days by picking up btu and then selling it again, and bought up bcc and am up 20% on that now. Expect it to swing back in btu favor soon for a big but shortlisted gain, then back to bcc when the fudstorm rolls in

^this. RBF effectively makes doublespending much simpler by making an otherwise difficult transaction (in most wallets it would involve 'forgetting' the low-fee transaction so that the same coins can be deliberately sent elsewhere as high-fee)
Rbf makes this technical maneuvering as simple as a few clicks in a user-facing "feature".

I'll quote the top reply at the link, which I agree with:
""What prevents an attacker from building a custom ASIC and buying off-the-shelf DRAM chips, and building systems that pair each ASIC with a DRAM chip?" Ideally that ASIC would be smaller but not faster (sequentially) than a conventional computer. If the relative cost of RAM compared with the CPU is big enough, this advantage would be relatively small"
Combine with bulk discounts and the fact that some of the best AND cheapest ram is built in china (or even surrounding Asia), and it would simply turn into a race of who can buy and run the most ram. Home mining ($50-$150 motherboard w/ 4 slots, ddr3/4) would be rapidly overtaken by the described devices, or some simplified interface with an RPi i/o board that can run 100+ ram sticks under high airflow within the footprint of a single ATX motherboard. Soon, manufacture make custom products that are just a singular PCB with power and ethernet connections, and nearly 10TerraBytes of ram.
Nothing is asic-proof when enough money is involved. Even if a process required a cpu, ram, hdd space, and some sort of user input - any sudden change of algorithm would give a major head start to whoever has the money to design custom hardware and software to make the process more efficient and capable of higher power density and reduced user input/work once it's running. 
Personally, I don't think there's a solution to this, it's a naturally centralizing process
@_date: 2016-01-16 02:08:12
I agree with this. other than vauge 'roadmaps" btc/Core has done very little for scaling.
I think segwit is a good idea, but the simple reality is that its still fairly new in its design and might not be *SAFE to implement for several months or more, even then its just a modest ~1.75x capacity increase expected.
Mike provided a litany of excellent arguments against INaction with regard to scalability, and the fact that the "no hard-forks" point of view is flawed.
We've seen there was support for BIP101 (implemented via XT), we see that there is a very general consensus that an increase is needed, and 2MB or 2-4-8 would be a more 'gentle' approach.
Something needs to be done. Everyone is looking to btc/Core, and IMO the best approach is to just try hardforking with a small increase (heck, even 1.2MB) to see what happens. You wont break the wall of china, you wont centralise it, you wont end up with petabytes of spam...

I took that quote from his answer to refer as much to core-vs-BU as it does to miners-vs-users.
BU/EC gives miners control over blocksize, but in a way that is not much different than their ability to impact blocksize through hardforks like classic/XT. its simply a finer level of control with more frequent adjustment. however, its a fairly novel concept and perhaps needs to be trialed on an altcoin/testnet better
but a switch to BU would make them "the bitcoin devs", rather than the group associated with the core client. The politics of this are what seems to be the worst part of the whole scaling discussion

as far as im aware, no matter how big and complex-to-host the blockchain gets, it will ALWAYS still be *POSSIBLE* to host a decentralized node

why wouldnt it? assuming the scaling occurs at the same pace as the slowest factor (cpu, ram, validation process, bandwidth?), it could very easily scale on-chain.
cpus/ram/ssd capacity all improve by &gt;25%/year at a fairly constant price. libseck256 presumably improves validation speeds by ~7x (or 50%/year spread over the next 5 years), and bandwith improves at "Nielsen's Law of Internet Bandwidth", or 50%/year
by all accounts, there is no reason why the blocksize could not therefore scale at 25%/year and be possible for as large a % of the userbase to run a full node as it is today. By the logic above, if 1MB worked in 2009 then a 4MB blocksize would be equally viable today.
The biggest concern about a lerger blocksize right now is what happens if a single transaction occurs that is so complex it is &gt;1MB in size. the last time a single tx like this occured it caused sites like bc.info to crash and had very slow validation times and poor propagation speed as a result. this could be avoided by including a rule that no single transaction can exceed 10% of the blocksize
concepts like segwit and thinblocks would give massive 1-time boosts to how easily a larger blocksize can be used and largely eliminate processing/bandwidth concerns

In theory anyone could set up a hub and create channels to anyone. In practice, however, hubs will be large regulated and licensed companies (think Coinbase and Circle), will require AML/KYC, and most of clients' spendable coins will be locked up with them. A hub can refuse to relay any or all your payments, and if that blocks all the paths to Starbucks, you will not be able to buy coffeee at Starbucks. And, according to some estimates, connecting to a hub may require a large fee, like 20 or 100 USD.

you dont seem to understand that miners are the ones who enforce the rules. if a majority of users/nodes decide to not *follow* the rules though, it can create a fork where the unwanted rules become the shorter chain. But its still absolutely up to the miners (on both of those chains) to decide which transactions are included in mined blocks. its impossible for a user or node to process a transaction themselves without actually mining it in a block. 
miners cant meaningfully vote for things that are not the bitcoin blockchain anymore than a canadian citizen can meaningfully vote for the death of Kim Jong.

why not? surely testnet miners can make thier own dust transactions and basically fill blocks they mine with "spam". 
The testnet should be put under similar conditions to the real network (ie: mostly-full blocks, occasionally creating massive mempools, relaying faked SPV blocks (or was this a segwit fix?), etc) as a form of stress test. if the hobbyists involved on it can maintain it in those conditions, then it matches the real network, and you move onto full 2MB blocks and try again

A hard fork is the 'right' way to implement significant rule changes I beleive. 
And even if a finney attack can be overcome by waiting for 2-5 confirmations depending on attacker hashrate, that's a serious issue in a realm where zero-conf is desirable (and RBF/dpublespend attacks are seen as a threat). This could make 'fast transactions' unsafe in the weak chain, which leads to the migration of hashrate to the &gt;75% chain. As problems/risk worsen, more and more hashrate could switch

or you could implement checkpoints, where you choose a block of selected age to "trust" (ie: 50,000 blocks ago, or approx 1yr) and simply download forwards from there. (you can always download the older/missing blocks over a span of days or weeks later on)

if you were to use thinblocks (or similar methods for reducing "burst" bandwidth every 10 minutes), you could run a node even at ~100kbps/down and be able to keep up with 3.2MB of new transactions every minute (53kbps) plus a thinblock thats likely smaller than 1MB (10 seconds to download)
of course, this doesn't account for other sources of network usage or the fact that upload speeds would probably be dismal.

thats not really the case at all. the miners block segwit because it could take a huge amount of users into 2nd layer applications, and it maintains the 1mb blocksize (which miners have been asking to raise via an array of different methods (8mb, 2mb, EC)
IMO miners should support this because its a simple but effective way to fit more into a block, while making transactions smaller. User fees could drop, while miners still see the same income.

im in both subforums, and voted for the difficulty retarget option as thats the quickest way to try and level the playing field so that miners dont simply move the the faster chain (which will retarget first and be more profitable due to the difficulty drop)
we need segwit and blocksize increase, and the toxic infighting and lack of significant compromise from core (they could have already put out a 2MB fork code that is compatible with EC, and have it signalled seperately from segwit) are whats causing people to support BC/Classic/XT in thier attempts to at least make blocksize-adjustment code AVAILABLE
in a system like bitcoin, we should be able to have multiple fork signalling, so that updates and fork proposals can be actively signalled/flagged by miners over a long span of time, rather than rushed over a span of a few months

the reality is there hasnt been a fork.
the reality is that the consensus mechanism is built around the theory of the longest (most resiliant) chain.
the hypothetical is that BU is somehow planning to fork with only 30% of miner support. however, its unlikely they would attempt a fork with anything less than 75-80% hashrate and that is months away at least. (plenty of time for people on both sides of the argument to do more research)

@_date: 2016-01-19 02:55:58
its not a threat, its a move to form consensus via 'voting', particularly as the 2Mb rules do not take effect until a majority of users are onboard.
Ideally, Classic will mimic the core 0.12rc, but with the 2mb rules (and maybe drop RBF). Both implementations will work totally fine together, and there would probably be a progressive movement of hashrate to classic clients with the 2MB support (this might reach 1%, 10%, or maybe even the 75% supermajority). Ideally this will take a few weeks or months, giving core devs time to ready thier client to handle 2mb *if it happens and/or release a version that actively supports 2mb in order to lead to consensus.
its a shared project. Having slightly different, but compatible, feature sets in different competing clients is good, like having cell phone companies besides apple and t-mobile

1) he said nothing false. he could have specified a majority of MINERS, but the broader statement is equally true. if a 3:1 majority supports larger blocks, that supermajority will lead to a fork. As such, miners 100% get to decide on protocol rules (assuming nodes will relay)
2) merchants? what, like those who accept bitcoin transactions? Because they dont care. If a fork occurs, they will likely follow the hashrate because who wants to be on the least secure SHA256 blockchain? As someone who sells things for bitcoin, I would make the upgrade to the 2mb client as soon as i heard that the 75% miner conditions are met
From the beginning it was known that as a PoW system, the people who control the hashrate/transaction validation are the ones with a 'vote" in the system. They made large investments in physical mining hardware and infrastructure to secure the network in exchange for [block subsidy] + [fees]. 
if you want a bigger say in bitcoin, you need to back it with economic investment in mining
@_date: 2016-01-18 00:44:35
No. Assuming that the majority of transactions stay the way they are now (basic 1-1 tranactions), segwit will only offer a 60-100% increase (1.6-2mb effective limit per block)
Only way segwit will effectively triple/quadruple block capacity is for large transactions with more inputs/outputs, or for transactions designed with segwit-aided features. Realistically it would take a few months to get near that point
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:07:12
It likely won't reach 4mb unless a pool restructures multiple transactions to save space, then dumps whatever it can to the segwit block. (similar to the 1mb f2pool block a few months back)
Realistically, segwit will probably offer a 2.5mb space availability for the vast majority of blocks by the end of 2016, assuming it's even available by summer.
That's not bad, but the issue is more urgent than waiting most of a year for 2mb *effective maxblocksize. Unless btc/core wants btc/classic to become much more dominant, they should be pushing for bigger blocks and not only segwit of we will be back to square one within a year when even 2-3mb segwit blocks are full

but that gpu is only going to experience brief periods of good profitability. as the difficulty on te mined coin increases, power costs eventually grow larger tan mining income for residential users.
and then some other GPU crypto shows up - everyone flocks to it, and that first currency is left with a suddenly much weaker hashrate.
ASICS cause a mutual dependance between the miner and the chosen currency.

@_date: 2016-01-16 17:20:43
Your solution is to wait a year to even *consider scaling? That's insane.
Right now over 50% of miners have voiced support for a nearly-immediate growth to 2mb. That's as much a vote as you are going to see. 
Remember the 'scaling' seminars, which showed consensus for an increase but failed to include voting or result in any actual changes other than code development that is months away
@_date: 2016-06-27 23:06:38
Right now fees are about 0.5btc/block while subsidy is about to drop by 6.25btc. That's quite a difference. In 8 years when it falls to 1.557btc fees will almost certainly be an equal or greater portion of the miner revenue
Without a few market caused by blocksize bottlenecking, miners could opt for soft limits on thier blocksize or on minimum fees to be included. This forms a dynamic market between miners, as opposed to the fairly static bottleneck of 1mb
(for example, a year ago a lot of miners had the default 750kb soft limit on their blocksize)

GPU mining centralizes where power is cheap as well though. all the advantages the chinese have in ASICs will transfer to GPUs. There are already farms with hundreds or thousands of GPUs running ethereum.
only difference might be supply chain control. but remember that most GPUs are made in Asia also, so they will still have discounted access to hardware and power.

Anyone can buy an S9 miner right now. thats not the issue. You want something a bit quieter and cheaper, look at the S7-LN or hope that they release an S9-LN in the future
the issue is power costs. In parts of the world (china, washington, labrador, panama) power is extremely cheap, &lt;$0.06/kwh, or about $40/kw/month. But in many places, power costs $0.12/kwh, or ~$80/kw/month, if not more.
mining hardware is priced based on the market. guys with cheap power save about $500/year compared to those paying double, and at $2000/S9 that creates a very good profit margin (especially since half the cost is mined within the first ~4 months, and can be used to buy more hardware)
tldr; mining cost money - and for many people it costs more than it produces after months or years of creating extra household noise/heat.
@_date: 2016-06-30 08:56:01
thats stupid. "waste electricity so you can buy electricity to waste elsewhere"
the first half makes sense as it produces bitcoin were electricity is cheap- but the idea of then using that on electricity elsewhere makes no sense. electricity=value, but that doesnt mean bitcoin is magically transacting electricity from china to california
@_date: 2016-06-27 18:06:51
but if fees become too high, why bother using bitcoin? people will start using other cryptocurrencies for smaller payments, which could push bitcoin to the wayside. lately ive been paying &gt;$0.20/tx whereas other currencies like DGC or LTC are &lt;$0.05/tx.
and with less transactions in bitcoin, miners might start enforcing minimum fees (in leiu of full-block bottleneck), which simply worsens the problem as a catch-22.
Right now: Fees = 1MB * fee/kb * 1000
with 2MB: Fees = 2MB *fee/kb *1000
miners could be making more fees/block than they do right now, while carging less fee/kb to users. seems pretty win-win
@_date: 2016-06-27 19:30:24


I remember 2-3 years ago people said exactly that about bitcoin "its no good because noone accepts it unless its for drugs"

That would mean linear scaling, whereas I think most people would argue exponential scaling (0.15/yr now but 0.3/yr by 2025 and 0.5/yr by 2040) better suits bitcoin adoption.
But even with 2mb, core could just pit out a 3mb code soon after, and allow the network to signal on it (even if it takes a long time to reach the trigger support levels). There's no reason why different fork update codes can't signal independently
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:58:23
But core vocally does not support it, and the developers who made the 'hk consensus' agreed to make a 2mb code that was supported
Unless I'm misunderstanding some part of it?

whatever other people say, its not supposed to be "us vs them" mentaility. classic/XT/BU are not "forceful takeover attempts", but rather they provide slightly modified version of the bitcoin core code that is 100% compatible today, but puts down the framework to enable a hardfork rule change down the road (such as if 75% of blocks are mined by that code)

Granted, its quite likely a lot of these transactions are not 'ideal" transactions - things like low-fee micro/dice transactions, attempted re-send/RBF transactions, and perhaps even malicious DDOS-esque spam. But the fact is that the daily sum of transaction fees has risen by 400% in the past two years, from 10BTC/day (0.07BTC/block) to 50BTC/day (0.34 BTC/block). With the recent price increase, that means the fiat$ cost of transactions has significantly rise in 2016 with the advent of genuinely-full blocks on a consistent basis.

It's not much different than implying that because luke-jr has strange religious and/or blocks zero opinions, all of core is somehow going to start adding scripture into the segwit code or reduce blocksize to 400kb.
A lot of people think inflation is necessary for a currency longterm. Doesn't mean it's going to change anytime soon - but the bitcoin code does allow for rule changes enforced by miners, so adding inflation one day is always a possibility (but requires great scrutiny as it fundamentally changes bitcoin's original constraints)

Nodes will downtrend regardless imo. Even at 60gb blockchain today it isn't something most people want on thier machine consuming cpu/ram/bandwidth/storage.
A good parallel is p2p file transfers. There can be thousands of 'leechers' all supported primarily by a few dozen powerful seeds. 
I envision in a few years that there will be &lt;100 nodes that are in datacenters or operated by large companies who accept/use bitcoin, and these will have virtually unlimited resources/bandwidth to support nearly 90% of the network's propogation. There will be a few hundred/thousand nodes with good specs that can achieve &gt;1:1 propagation, and then there will be tens of thousands of nodes that are "leechers" or run pruned/spv wallets
Just because I can only upload ~100kBps doesn't mean the entire network should stoop to that level. Let the guy with 50MBps fiber handle propagation.
Imo the greatest tragedy is the lack of incentive to running a full node.
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:51:52

seriously though, what do you expect when dealing with a blockchain and not a simple table of balances?
its 100GB now, with compact blocks you only worry about 1MB/10min (1.6kBps) - so its safe to assume ongoing datausage isnt the issue.
1) imaged media devices (USB drive, HDD, whatever). buy a arddrive for your node and for a ~$10 premium get one with the entire blockchain already written on it.
2) take the time to downlod it. at 70GB now, lets assume its eventually 1TB (be it several years data, or larger blocks). to download that at 2MBps (readily available speed today) takes 140 hours (less tan a week). at 10MBps (quite accessible today for residential use) is 28hrs. at 100MBps (common to datacenters today, and likely the public within the next decade) we're talking about 3hrs
granted, it assumes a strong P2P network to fully utilize your network
@_date: 2016-06-27 22:50:29
I would not say zero proof, but the 'voting' you refer to did indicate at least 5-10% interest (~5% hashrate, 10-15% node count iirc)
Keep in mind some miners did not move away from core because of the HK consensus, otherwise there *could* have been a larger classic hashrate
Consensus won't be immediate - i think it's good to encourage a variety of clients with different agendas, as long as they all follow the bitcoin protocol consensus until various issues reach majority consensus to be forked (be it a risky 75% or an overreaching 95%).

how do you come to those conclusions. Te basic principal says that if you double the space for transactions to be included, there will be lower fees and less waiting time to get included in a block.
miners need to make fees though. by reducing fee pressure via blocksize increase, they need to determine the risk/reward of including transactions below a fee threshold regardless of blockspace. If fees are lower, miners will strive to put more transactions in a block, or impose soft limits on either blocksize or thier minimum fees.
so rather than having the minimum fee be "to beat everyone else to the limited blockspace" it will be "to convince miners the transaction fee is worth processing (due to orphan risk or simply imposed soft limits)"
thats how it works with mining in any other commodity. You only want to take enough oil from the ground to satisfy immediate demand without flooding the market. it works for OPEC it will work for bitcoin.better the miners choose competitive arbitrary limits than developers simple leave a hard bottleneck that takes months or years to remove

What are you talking about? I'd love to know where 400kb is coming from if it isn't from transaction volume.
Do blockchain fairies leave behind extra data when they visit? Maybe it's satoshi spamming 400kb of data without using a single transaction to do it?
Stop trying to say blocks are half full when any block Explorer clearly shows otherwise. (or demonstrate your source of that value). Even if *you* think it's spam, that spam is paying fees and consists of actual transaction volume.
I agree secondary layers are required for cheap micropayment use, but trying to bottleneck the blockchain to force layered use (which is barely in alpha mode with blockchains Thunder protocol) is insanity.

There are two types of miners: those who use a pool and only send a few kb back and forth (the pool server is in a datacenter, and acts as an extremely well-connected node), and those that keep a node in the same location as the mining farm (which may be susceptible to bandwidth/latency issues)
Even antpool uses a mining node in a major shanghai datacenter, not at the mining farm location(s). I'm not sure how much improvement that provides, but I don't think it's always considered in bigblocks=centralization arguments 
As such, that datacenter node is responsible for relay network and p2p broadcast, and has fiber optic global connections that can easily achieve this. It's not that some remote village in china is trying to send the uncompressed block (they only send the successful nonce info to shanghai)

Currencies with POS essentially give voting/mining power based on wallet balance. The rich/invested have the most say, because they have the coin's best interest at heart. (POW uses similar logic towards those invested in hardware)
alternatively, trade your BTC to another currency like BCH/ETH/etc if that currency is still accepted by the services you use and has faster/cheaper transactions.
to call it voting isnt entirely accurate - its more of a polling, where the result is a *reasonably* accurate depiction of the ~$40B (more, less?) invested in/by the SHA256 mining industry. Compare that to the extremely vocal opinions of some people who hold very few bitcoins and/or dont even mine them. An alternative is users can sign a message with an address as a sort of pos polling

most of the issues come from the fact that the network didnt scale blocksize (either via hardfork, or a more complex method like segwit) when it needed to drastically increase capacity.
As early as 2014-2015 fees got to the point that onchain microtransactions were no longer a usage case of bitcoin, and so far there hasnt been much of an L2 that can support them.  Except.... a half-dozen altcoins that transact faster and cheaper
next, coffee transactions became unreasonable in 2015. in 2016, treansaction fees make even smallish (&lt;$10) transactions unreasonable due to fees and/or mempool size.

both sides are guilty of the same things, but via different approaches.  Each has a unique vision of bitcoin's next step(s), and noone is willing to agree on what should be the first step implemented.
IMO A.A. is not a henchman of r/bitcoin. Much of what he says is fairly neutral, and IIRC he supported both segwit and larger blocks
Also, I like "Bcash" its clearer than BCH and is much easier to type and read than "Bitcoin cash".
The real truth is in the hashrate. right now, those mining the Bcash chain are only ~half as profitable as if they switched to bitcoin, but that could change, or at least approach an equilibrium as the difficulty is adjusted
@_date: 2016-06-06 02:36:01




Im confused - either the 4MB is due to higher transaction volume (thus a correlation), or you're saying segwit turns 1MB worth of transactions into 4MB (which would be horrendous)
simple fact is that 1MB has worked fine since 2010. Unless you havent upgraded any of your computer hardware in the last 6 years, It seems obvious that greater resource requirements can be met with hardware that is half a decade more advanced.

so in comparison, bip 91 (sw2x) had &gt;95% support. it should be able to successfully fork away, and 5-10% remain in segwit-only - where they be under similar/greater risk than BCH is currently faced with

@_date: 2017-01-30 20:46:18
part 1:  bitcoin unlimited addresses the blocksize issue by enabling miners to flag blocks they mine with a preference/vote of what the maxblocksize should be. with enough majority of miners agreeing, blocksize can increase  (NOTE: blocksize increases do not happen until supermajority is voting for larger blocks)
ps: BU does not mean literally unlimited blocksize limits right away.
part 2: error in the BU code caused an oversized block to be submitted to the blockcahin (worth 12.5BTC subsidy+~0.7BTC fees). rest of network correctly saw it as invalid, and life went on normally with the next &lt;1MB block. (ie: the network forked for a single block, which could be easily seen as invalid to most nodes/miner)
part 3: because a BU miner released this invalid by fluke, others are pointing fingers saying "he lost 13.2BTC". thats not really the case though - the nonce used wouldn't have been a solution if the block was sized correctly (so no guarantee the miner would have found a solution if there was no bug)
tldr; BU 1.0.0 had a coding error that seems easy to resolve, and a lot of people are losing their minds over it (or simply using it as a reason to throw insults at BU and its devs)
pps: some people argue that SPV miners (~60% of the network) will blindly follow an invalid block and could accidentally change the consensus. thats not really how it works though - SPV miners generally still validate, just not until they have the entire block downloaded to verify (anywhere from 2seconds-40seconds after the solution is broadcast). For that short period, they blindly hash on whatever SHA256 chain is longest because they have not yet validated
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:16:16
It's okay, because it's been about 5-6 years since we first hit the 1mb limit. And I think processing/networking has safely improved by almost 4x in that time span

And bigger blocks won't stop many people from running nodes. Just because an RPI from 2010 struggles to handle &gt;1.6kBps (1MB/10min) and needs a $30 (128gb) storage card doesn't mean the network will fall into centralised disarray with the advent of 2mb (or larger) blocks.

it was oversize by 23 BYTES (that's only 0.023kB - most 'simple' transactions are ~0.2kB), due to a problem in how much it thought could fit in 1MB. a simple but obvious mistake in the code that should have been found pre-release or by a built in check when the block is assembled.

storage and bandwidth are both growing at rapid speeds. in 2009 $100 got you a 500GB harddrive - today, 2TB (maybe even 3TB). 2TB is probably sufficient to store the blockchain (even with 4mb blocks) for the next decade or more
in 2009 $50/month got you around 200kBps downloads - today, 2MBps
@_date: 2016-11-28 15:46:13
with current block, you could put through 1MB of your own data (lets call it that instead of spam, since it still costs a fee) for about ~0.5BTC fees
with segwit, you could put through 1MB+2.7MB of your own data (lets call it that instead of spam, since it still costs a fee) for about ~0.5BTC fees
the point is that for roughly the same fees, segwit allows someone to force an abnormlly large amount of data upon the network (which is its purpose, of course). The only opposing force would be if miners charge additional fees for segwit data so that a 3.7MB block might take 1BTC in fees (instead of 0.5BTC)
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:38:50
but that makes the 1mb blocksize seem redundant, since validating nodes would still be holding the (larger) segwit datablock also
@_date: 2016-11-19 19:52:29
im not sure this analogy is quite going properly.
1MB worked when it was a 2-lane gravel road in 2009. Since then the road has been widened and paved (bandwidth has improved ~5x), and we're driving a car built in 2016 (computing capabilities improved 5-10x).
Even though the posted speedlimit is still the same, its reasonable that it should be increased due to the improved road quality and capabilities of the cars we drive today.

admittedly, most of the code lines in the blocksize increase proposals were a sort of 'check' - the actual change to maxblocksize and the flagging mechanism were only a small nuber of lines in the code.
segwit offers a lot of real benefits, but without widespread usage and/or the lightning network it cannot accomodate much more growth in bitcoin use (70-100% increase is the number im seeing - enough for maybe a year or two more at most). Does maxblocksize still factor into the core roadmap as the next step?
also, what about the idea that segwit/lightning take away fees from the miners? a reduction in mining profitability will only serve to centralize miners where power is cheap (ie: datacenters near hydrodams in china/washington/labrador)

luke-jr started the "spam" phrase - its always been a poor choice of word since its not free (such as spamming by email) due to fees.
everything in the block is pay-for-inclusion data. The fear is that some people might pay to put meaningless data in order to bloat bandwidth and storage. But both those things are pretty resiliant to geting a few extra MB (or even GB) of data forced onto them.
the bigger concern is that this user takes away available blockspace from other users - causing higher fees for inclusion and/or network delays. To an extent, the "attacker" makes it more and more expensive of an attack, but could easily obstruct the vast majority of other users for about $100,000/day. The network could be rendered useless for a week at the cost of ~$1,000,000
increasing the amount of data throughput (and thus the fees to completely utilize it) is the real solution to "spam". in segwit, that would mean miners charging users for segwit data, not just UTXO data
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:46:29
That's insane.  Let users run lightweight spv wallets and obtain data from those on the network with better capacity.
Everyone uses Facebook but it doesn't need to be p2p to work - it just needs a handful of global datacenters. Ideally bitcoin could have a few hundred powerful data center nodes that are still decentralized and can distribute the ledger to millions of other propogation nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:57:11
and yet many of those fighting against the "bigblockers" wanted segwit because it kept blocks &lt;1MB
@_date: 2016-11-28 15:29:52
bandwidth isnt really (besides the initial download thats about the size of two major video games (witcher3 is &gt;30GB). 1MB/10min is only 1.6kB/s
anyone with a 1Megabit connection (125kBps) can maintain a node, and many people have connection speeds exponentially higher.
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:06:24








100% agree. Bcash definitely appears to be a bit rushed in its activation, yet it appears to have made an important point: Its still alive and holds some value - and miners CAN use their hashrate as they please.
Bitcoin is still an experiement, and IMO its exciting to see what will happen with two differently-helmed chains. Bitcoin-Cash will also need to look at how to implement segwit or an alternative update that enables Lightning and other L2 systems cleanly
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:06:17
but it might still add even a small amount of traction to BCH if miners are willing to mine it even if its slightly less profitable than BTC (just as others will surely do vice-versa if they beleive segwit is the better solution)
@_date: 2016-11-30 20:15:56
not really, depends on the motivation to the attack.
someone with $50,000,000 could pretty much dominate the blockchain for months, even if fees tripled or quadrupled in response.
only workarounds are for miners to ignore the transactions (less profit, but 'greater good'), or for bigger blocks that give more space (and thus cost more fees/block to obstruct)
ie: if $50M could obstruct the blockchain for 4 months, with 4MB blocks it would cost ~$200M for the same duration of attack
this is the biggest reason for more space in blocks IMO. let the miners decide the minimum fees for 'spam' filtering, while ensuring its costly to bloat or obstruct the overall functionality
@_date: 2016-11-30 05:45:02
not really - it would cause an increase in hashrate due to the higher fees, but that wouldnt have any effect on the attack

a centralised DB isnt trustless. bitcoin is, and as long as even a few honest nodes exist it would be easy to identify any "incorrect" changes made by other nodes.
global usage requires both on and off-chain solutions in unison. 1MB isnt enough even for settlement if theres 1GB/10min going on in off/side-chain transactions.
I dont think bitcoin's future will mean every person is mining and running a node - thats silliness. But the point is that they *can*, in order to maintain a trustless nature of the blockchain.
even the bitcoin whitepaper alludes to this, acknowledging the benefits of SPV for "basic" users, while pointing out that businesses who have stronger/active interest in bitcoin (such as making/taking payments) would want to run a full node.

bitcoin is still looking for any semblence of a true value. but the rising price brings attention and new demand (fomo/yolo/hype/etc)
IMO, were not public news yet. in 2013 the public became aware around the $400 mark (up from ~$140 in a short timeframe). it brought a lot of attention, and within a month it was past $1000

BU isn't literally unlimited blocksize. It uses a voting system to implement size changes, and a few other tricks to try and make the size actively adjust to network conditions.

What's wrong with a datacenter node? You think p2p downloads are entirely powered by users on low-bandwidth connections?
There are peers/nodes on the network capable of insane rates of upload, and able to verify blocks extremely fast.
Decentralized doesn't have to mean every single person carries the blockchain on their phone or home pc. A few hundred or thousand powerful nodes run by those with vested interest in the ledger (banks, tech giants, users with the right equipment, etc) is sufficient to provide much larger-than-current blocks to a user's worldwide.
Anyone who is struggling to run a node today won't be running one in a few years - they will just use a lightweight or spv client.

blocksize. the best defense against someone taking up entire blocks with data, is to create more room. that way, taking up an entire block becomes more costly, without an increase in $/kb fees to others

tps is directly related to blockspace. "TPS" isnt a constant, it varies by how much data is actually in the transction(s).
someone can use ~500 segwit transactions to dominate the 1MB block (and create a 2.7MB signatures block)
@_date: 2016-11-17 17:36:59
Your post is exponentially more FUD then what the AMA contains.
I think it's quite clear that blocks need to be able to move more than the current quantity of transactions. The current solutions are:
1) make blocks bigger by turning a 6yr-old limit into something that adjusts to match market conditions (ie: match demand, without making space "free")
2) reduce the on-chain space needed by transactions, primarily by moving signature data into a type of secondary "tag-along" block. This is a significant change to how blocks are mined/validated/stored.
I think both solutions are needed for a robust system, and that  is quite straightforward to understand and implement (compared to segwit).

how does no viable blocksize proposal exist? you have "classic", "BU", and BIP100/101
they all aim to simply increase the maxblocksize parameter, rather then splitting the blockchain into a system of 'block-pairs'. Not saying that they are any better than segwit in technical standards, but they do exist, and they achieve scaling with a comparatively simple change to the code.

i dont understand - are you saying that big blocks would make it easier for a spammer to "buy" a full block than it would be for them to do so via segwit? In both situations, the total cost to fill a block (lets say 3.7MB of junk) is the exact same

Fixing malleability is something to be dealt with, but segwit itself is much more than a simple malleability fix.
Sehwit isn't a bad idea, neither is lightning. Off-chain (sidechain) transactions will play a major role in the future of cryptocurrency. However, they will still be affected by the size of blocks in the primary chain.
Imagine the 4x optimal compression of segwit, used with lightning to enable virtually limitless off chain transaction throughput. The problem arises with opening/closing the lightning hubs, and otherwise settling transactions to the primary blockchain ledger. At 1mb, there is still a hard limitation that could make settlements expensive or backlogged.
We need to improve scaling on and off chain. Imo that means increasing blocksize first (it's the most simple and practical change), followed shortly after by segwit/lightning to exponentially increase the transaction throughput capabilities.
To say larger blocks cause centralization is a bit silly. Sure, a raspberry pi (v1) might not cut it as a full node, and you might need to buy a 128gb sd card ($30) this year and upgrade to a 512gb card in ~4 years (likely $30 at that time). But the size issues remain if you plan to store segwit blocks.
Right now, most of the network is supported by a small number of high-powered nodes (servers in datacenters where they have fibre connections). The guys running nodes on home networks with &lt;100kbps upload rates really don't have much impact in comparison.
A few years ago streaming 480p was amazing. Now 1080p is a yawn and 4K streaming is available to many people in urban centers. In a few more years 1Gbps+ networking will be common. Yet blocksize is where it was in 2009

Understandable, and I think it's a somewhat common misperception that BU means some sort  of instant 10GB/block fork.
The goal is to enable a smoother path to larger blocksize without the chaos created by hard limits like the 1mb. Blocksize should be conservative, yet flexible to the requirements of growing transaction volume

@_date: 2016-11-18 17:15:58
Since you're getting a lot of "because they don't like core" responses, I think a bit more information is needed.
Segwit offers a lot of benefits, but there is a significant change to the bitcoin code required for it. In contrast, there are other malleability fixes that are much simpler, and blocksize can likewise be adjusted in a much simpler manner.
Imo segwit is a good idea and enables a lot of future features - but transaction throughput could be better served by a simple increase of maxblocksize
@_date: 2016-12-01 03:29:31
tldr; we basically agree that the outcome is that miners will charge additional fees based on the segwit block's size?
its a good point that segwit blocks wouldnt be used for bibleverses or plaintext messages
@_date: 2016-11-30 22:28:39
thats probably true (Im knowledgable but definitely not an expert), but the original point still stands that segwit would allow you to force more data upon the network (particularly full nodes) for no additional fee, unless miners start incorporating the size of the signatures block into their "transaction selection / minimum fee algorithm(s)"
@_date: 2016-11-29 23:26:43
you are looking at the cost of a constant storage quantity - what im saying is that for a constant price, you should see a big growth in storage size.
ie: 240GB hdd cost $89 in 2007, or $59 in 2013, or $29 today (just the physical drive). however, for $89 you could get a 2TB harddrive today
part of it is 'base costs'. its like buying a 100GB HDD - its not going to cost $5 simply because you can get 1TB for $50. A harddrive has components that cost money (probably ~$15) without even considering the platter size/quantity. same goes for the overhead of online storage

It's funny how this is the opposite of EDA, since EDA is a protection mechanism. If hashrate leaves bch it reduces difficulty after 12hrs so blocks return to a 10min schedule. If miners leave btc, there is only the 2016-block periods for adjustment which means low block output for weeks before it adjusts
But I appreciate that difficulty adjustment methods are the Fud of the day - it leads to better education of the subject for those who don't understand it.

what, every worldwide gov will start doing that in unison?
the whole point is its still an open, decentralized ledger that anyone can have a local copy of. its an obvious fact that not everyone in a p2p network can provide a useful upload rate, and that a smaller number of well-connected nodes provide the backbone
i want bitcoin to go global. that means feeding a huge amount of digital data worldwide, probably 1,000,000x-100,000,000x the current transactions (both on the primary chain, and on sidechains/off-chain)
and im not sure if sewit does anything to allow node decentralization. it reduces verification work, but otherwise full nodes would still have both blocks (ie: no size reduction, ~1.7MB/10min)
@_date: 2016-11-29 02:43:55

although - a fully-validating node would still need to do signature verification of the segwit data right?

Afaik there's never been issues with litecoin re-org of more than a few blocks. 8 litecoin confirmations (10-40min) is as secure as 2 bitcoin confirmations (10-100min) but the fees are lower and the first confirmation happens much sooner (4x faster on average)

you're talking about a corporatation-led hardfork, which is pure FUD. Same as the guys years back who said "microsoft will buy a $5M ASIC and 51% attack the network". Bitcoin is only limited by its userbase, which is limited by the accessibility and transaction volume.

To your first question, you claim jihan is trying to make money off others. By that logic, others mining BCH can also make money by selling the coins they mine. That's like miner rationale 101 - follow the profitable chain (whether this is problematic is a whole different discussion)
As for saving a buck? If the centralised coin acts as a cheap and reliable medium of exchange, then sure some people are going to use it. There's been no censorship in that chain (yet), and it's been an adequate (compared with volatility of some altcoins) store of value.
Everyone has different ideals. Some people buy groceries at Walmart instead of a farmers market, or wear Nike/adidas instead of hemp-based clothing. I support letting the market decide.
Imo, bch is still a gamble. With an updated difficulty algorithm and a potential influx of more s2x-denied miners it could become more decentralised and stable then it is today, and doesn't suffer from high fees. I refuse to write it off just because of where the hashrate comes from until there's evidence that the hashrate is used for 'bad' such as censorship or doublespending/reorgs (which is very unlikely imo)
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:10:06
it would seem like less of an attack if more people worked together to reduce fees and increase throughput.

bandwidth is pretty much the opposite of latency. higher bandwidth services are *almost* always much lower ping/latency.
if all big miners (ie: solo mine with their own node) invest in better bandwidth for the reaons jToomin gave, latency between miners/pools will be lower. same goes for 'key' nodes that reside in datacenters with &gt;1GBPS speeds. 
for the remainder of the network (verifying nodes), a few seconds extra latency is meaningless

my issue isnt segwit, its the fact that segwit has been the main/only scaling solution bitcoin core is actively working on and promoting (plus its LN capabilities)
segwit is out and fees are still rising. right now its ~440sat/b to get included in 1-2 blocks ($6+ for a very basic transaction)
we need to scale onchain simultaneously in order to have enough spoace and keep fees low. doesnt need to be GB blocks or even 32MB blocks. 2MB+segwit would give us breathing room to make the system useful for transactions and would not bring the world crashing down on nodes.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:21:56


if bitcoin isn't decentralised now, whats your suggestion? allow fees to increase? because that wont attract users. A size increase is far more than a hope and a prayer - its common sense. 1MB didnt crash the system 6 years ago, so its simply absurd to think that bandwidth and storage technology hasnt made at least a 4x improvement since.




these are one and the same. trustless = ledger = size requirements. off-chain scaling sounds an awful lot like a centralised service (such as a bank) that only publicizes daily records


this 'fee market' concept is terrible - if noone can broadcast transactions in a reasonable time, noone will use the system. A hard fork, or transfer of weath to a larger-blocksize system such as litecoin, or bitcoin-XT will occur.
its basic math - low-value transactions may die out as a fee market develops, but one day there will be 1MB+ of valuable transactions that need to occur, fee competition will begin, and it will result in fees spiralling out of control until users leave the currency. The only way fees will ever decrease is when &lt;1MB of transactions take place on it (ie: where we are today)
@_date: 2017-11-09 17:33:38
Well we also came up with a clever way of pretending to scale in an update that requires users to migrate their funds to a new address and use a new compatible wallet software (and have their recipients do the same)
But it's a beautifully simple solution to transaction malleability, so we got that going for us

thats 100Mbps (16.6MBps) to do it in only 1 minute. Thats common mid-high tier in most developed cities today. 
and why are people obsessed with the threat of 1GB blocks? AFAIK BCH isnt against implementing sidechains or other protocol improvements. And were at ~1.2MB/10 min today. It could take a decade or more to reach 1000MB/10min (and thats in a bullish situation where Bitcoin cash succeeds to dominate the cryprtocurrency market and is worth exponentially more than today - which you probably feel isnt likely anyhow)

It also of course depends how and when they sell the coins, and proving the price they sell at.
Imagine if at the end of December they give each user 0.05btc per bch - users would be justified in being upset when bchbtc has been 2-3x that value for most of its trade history.
If they can do it transparently, then that's reasonable
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:12:56
This: I think it's *reasonable* but not ideal.
I personally think 4mb, doubling every 3 years, is a better proposal that deals with immediate need and lessens the exponential growth rate.
A 4mb block could handle ~6x the volume of "real" transactions the network sees right now. If there was another exponential price increase though it might be possible to see more volume than that within the next 2-3years

firstly, are you saying a 13kb/s connection for 8mb blocks? for a node thats terribly slow (10+ minutes to download 8MB) and for a miner its suicide.  I completely agree with Jtoomin - any decent miner either uses a pool (and the remote pool server just feeds small packets of hashing nonces) or would install 1MB/s+ connection to make sure the node sees new blocks fast and can relay solutions quickly to prevent orphans. even a 10MB/s connection is affordable to most people these days.
satellite internet is now accessible almost anywhere worldwide, with 5MB/s up and 17MB/s down for ~$150/month. bandwidth is not an issue for anyone except small nodes run by home users with low-end internet (and these nodes have such poor upload speeds that they act more as a ledger copy than as an active node)
the hard fork isnt happening for a long time. It will take until 2016 to see it approach hard fork conditions, and if it cant gain &gt;50% of the mining power by then it likely be abandoned quickly by most users. Without any other way to express a vote for blocksize change BitcoinXT is a good experiment for bitcoin. I think multiple clients with different parameters, but able to 'vote' and understand the voting systems of other clients will be the solution.

a home miner realistically has &lt;5kW (up to 20kW if they feel like spending &gt;$1000 on new 240V wiring, fuses, outlets, PDUs)
a small industrial unit can handle &gt;200kW. a large facility can handle &gt;2MW (some &gt;10MW).
home mining is a constantly shrinking minority of the network due to economy of scale and power/cooling/noise limitations. (for example, anyone running a bitmain S5/S5+ at home will probably need to spend $40+ on high-velocity, low-dB fans due to the noise - an industrial miner doesn't care how much noise is made since they dont live in that building)

That's absolutely naive - you expect home users to run two nodes, with fairly large blockchains they need to store and provide Up/down on.
IMO, common sense dictates that in 5 years from now, given unlimited space for blocksize growth (with limitations against spam), the network will look like this:
- A few dozen 'key nodes' that are located in major datacenters with virtually unlimited fiber bandwidth, lots of storage space, and full verification. Some might be hosted by companies such as google or IBM as demonstration of technical ability or involvement in crytocurrency
- thousands of smaller nodes on home computers or businesses that want their own full backend to handle payments. Its likely that many of these will operate pruned nodes or have limited upload capabilities. 
- A few dozen major mining companies and pools. There are a lot of datacenters that are set up in locations with good bandwith and cheap power in the 1-20MW range. Most pooled mining servers are located in major datacenters with high bandwith (ideally alongside a 'key node')
- smaller miners (&lt;50kW) will certainly be pooled mining, which removes the need for downloading full blocks or verifying (you just need to receive the nonce info, hash it, and return any valid solutions)
I 100% guarentee that the future of bitcoin will depend on the 'key nodes' (or 'trusted nodes') principal - where major national/trans-oceanic fiberoptic or satellite hubs throughout the world (such as NY, LA, Toronto, London, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo, etc) are capable of handling PETABYTES of uploads and downloads and could conceivable handle a virtually unlimited blocksize with state of the art systems. The rest of the network would then act as the broader decentralization and secondary validation.
ps: I like 8MB, doubling every 2 years, but I think 4MB doubling every 3 years would be more acceptable to those fighting for a small blocksize. Anything less than that would be insufficient for global usage

ps: I like 8MB, doubling every 2 years, but I think 4MB doubling every 3 years would be more acceptable to those fighting for a small blocksize. Anything less than that would be insufficient for global usage

For something like the $50 bcg yeah, but for bch that's worth ~0.18btc that's a lot of value that should be properly given to users, ideally in the form of bch tokens and not an arbitrary "we decided to sell it today for 0.xx btc. You're welcome"

i expect we will see hashrate oscillations be caused by the bitcoin difficulty adjustment instead, though far less volatile
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:36:45
Your argument has two points:


I agree that eventually bitcoin will be used for settlement and built-on services will provide better support for small, time-critical transactions like buying a cup of coffee 


This is silly. Firstly, lightning is useless in its current state and side chains lack any real popularity at the moment. Secondly, sidechains/builton services will work best if there is space to provide settlement on the blockchain. At 1mb, that won't be likely.
Lightning will work on an 8mb blockchain just as well as on a 1mb blockchain. It's not a reason to say "let's stagnate block size at the level it was arbitrarily set to in 2009"
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:39:54

what idiot statement is that?
i think that the 2xers might be the real bitcoiners, who see a network thats capable of much more than 1mb, held back by high fees. increases to throughput are the key to reducing fees
@_date: 2015-08-04 15:58:49
Mining will always centralize. The driver of decentralization is profitability for anyone, which only occurs during massive price increases.
During a price increase (and the rest of the time too) whoever pays the least for power will have the biggest gains and will have the most reason to add hashrate.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:55:33
If they were making profits off token speculation (eg bitfinex), probably a lot less then the trading fees. 
Otherwise, it would just require having a s2x capable node/wallet ready to go, and preparing a safe procedure to taint/split the coins in case of a chainsplit.
I bet most people spent more time fighting on reddit then prepping servers for a coin split. I'm open to someone who knows better explaining what sort of time and costs would actually be required to prepare, but I can't see much more than a few hours of dedicated work to ensuring a btc1 or other s2x node/wallet are functional and ready to go.

Imo anything over $1 for a 'simple' transaction detracts from the growth of the network, and makes bitcoin susceptible to being overtaken by a cryptocurrency that can offer much lower fees in the long term.
I'm all for scaling both onchain and offchain, and offchain should be lower fees naturally, but the current state/lack of onchain scaling is causing harm to bitcoin with $5+ fees to do a single-input,single-output payments
I believe miners are well equipped to impose a fee market through soft limits on blocksize,  setting minimum fees, and even nodes/miners refusing to relay blocks that are excessively large.
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:43:39
If bitmex wrecks bch value in the process, it will piss off their users who are getting a poor value for the bch that they were owed
Imagine that bitmex "owes me" 1bch because I had 1btc with them at the time of fork. If they gave me the coin I could probably sell it for 0.15btc or better right now. But instead they dump the market with thousands of coins at once and give me only 0.05btc because that's how low the market crashed as they sold my coin.  I think anyone in that situation would be a little bit pissed off.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:39:51
I'm not talking about s2x specifically, and in any case that still matches the 'hashrate follows value follows users' concept.
If you think a government can/would take over a majority of hashrate and dedicate it to weeks or months of mining an empty fork in order to outwork what users call 'bitcoin', that's a whole different discussion.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:58:42
Competing with cash using a 10min block time never made sense, and I don't think that was a priority. The goal was to do everything bitcoin can, but with lower fees due to increased throughput.
As for LN, I'm sure there will be sidechain projects that don't require segwit to function.

Further to this, most 'poorly connected' miners are small operations (a larger operation will invest in better networking such as satellite uplink), who do pooled mining and as such only require minimal stratum data. Ideally they mine at a pool that is 'well connected'
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:17:00
by "fundamental principal", I assume you mean decentralized mining, and not regarding nodes.
right now, almost 50% of mining is done by 3-4 companies (including Bitfury, Antminer/antpool, discusfish) using 1-20MW facilities or via pooled mining, 40% done by a few hundred 50-500kW home/office/industrial miners (90% of hashrate goes to pools), and the last 10% is by the &lt;10kW home miners who also do pool mining
MY EXPECTATION: in 5 years the top 50% of hashrate will be spread amonst at least 6-10 major interests (bitfury, 21e6, antminer, antpool, knc, intel, AMD, etc) with hashing facilities widely spread geographically. smaller &lt;5MW miners will make up 45%, and &lt;10kW miners will make up only 5%
this was expected to happen as mining is most profitable where power/overhead is cheap

we absolutely need to scale BOTH on and offchain to succeed. i agree.
but i think that a bare minimum (2mb) of onchain scaling is needed right now, not in 12-18+ months from now.

I can create a channel and start using LN today? I didn't think it was working in the network yet
@_date: 2015-08-02 16:48:29
so for example it would combine 10,000 transactions (micropayments, IoT, coffee purchases) and occasionally place them all into the blockchain ledger to validate the lot? Or does it settle everything in its own 'decentralized' ledger and only publish a few simple X-Y transactions per day?
Because we saw about a week ago that a mining pool (F2Pool?) swept something like 20,000 (~20MB) spam payments into a single 990kb transaction and published it to the blockchain. The network bent a bit and had some timing out on blockchain explorers, but otherwise was fine.
but thats still only a 20-&gt;1 compression ratio. Does LN achieve this differently?
@_date: 2015-08-02 15:17:53
I'm not against lightning/sidechains at all, but the bitcoin network must scale to be valuable. (Ideally, the blockchain will be best suited for tranactions &gt;$25 since a fee of ~$0.25/tx would be 1% - smaller, time-sensitive stuff is better for a sidechain) however, the transition to sidechain use is still a 1-3 years away and bitcoin needs to handle significant growth until then
IMO, there is a difference between 'pure centralised' (one controlling interest/company) and 'centralization in a decentralised network' (where major hubs of activity are in centralised locations, but overall network functions, validation, and control remain decentralised). This is why i suggest that some tech companies may be interested in operating major nodes and making it known that its 'their' node (ie: a node run by google may be more trustworthy than an unknown node, even if they are both the exact same blockchain and relay rules)

Fees being high is turning into a trend, not temporary.
The 1mb 'safety limit' made sense a few years back as a barrier to spam when blocks were &lt;200kb ,since a sudden influx of &gt;1mb/10min blocks wouldn't be likely from legit uses.
But the idea was to have it as a barrier against blocks being abnormally large. Not as a hard limit that every block should max out. In practicality the hard limit should be set at 2-3x the average blocksize IMO, and let nodes and miners impose softlimits
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:15:57

they still would not be 'managers' (if anything, 2/5 underpaid core devs working with blockstream is even more unthinkable)
out of curiousity, what approach do you want to see? as i mentioned, I think that the optimal is 4MB, doubling every 3 years ("4MB,x2/3yrs"). Its a reasonable step up from the current 1MB limit, and scales at a more conservative rate than the "8Mb,x2/2yrs" proposal. 
sidechains should not be a necessity this early in development.

It sat within a $300-500 range for quite some time, which was still 0.07-0.01btc and enough that users should care how it's being handled and call for transparency
I can see the purpose in how bitmex is handling things, they just need to do so in a clear way that benefits users. If they come back in December saying "we sold them at 0.05btc" with no evidence of the trade, that would be problematic.
Best solution is to slowly liquidate the coins in a way that can be audited, and then give users the aggregate value.

my current wallet is legacy. why should i pay $15+ to sweep a bunch of addresses into a segwit address, when i could just pay a $15 fee when i send those funds as a payment anyways at a later date.

my thoughts on BIP 100/101/etc, and what we need:
- should immediately/ASAP increase limit to 4MB
- should never have the ability to decrease in size (if miners want this, they can set their own soft limit caps)
- should never exceed 50%/year growth
- should never grow at less than 20%/year
- blocks should average 60% capacity, and rarely exceed 90%
beyond those restrictions, i think voting or some other determining factor(s) are necessary so that growth is reasonably well matched to user base and transaction volume.

So in other words, bitmain invested more into r&amp;d.
From a mining standpoint 'free power' could be quite advantageous. But it's got minimal benefit in designing and production of mining hardware.
Knc had a power hungry, problematic design. Bitmain produced hardware that, since day1 (antminer s1) was plug-and-play single units.
Not a pile of cubes with massive heatsinks, cable mess, and a seperate controller. They aimed at a big powerful chip while bitmain focused on a larger array of more efficient small chips.

so in other words, it risks stagnating if there isnt an 80% consensus to increase the size (not saying this is bad, but it is consistent with these proposals of extremely limited growth rates and retaining the 32MB cap)

again, i feel like people are not seeing that 'decentralisation' could be achieved with only a small handful of nodes and miners (more obviously increases the security). It means there is no central body or authority that can simply modify the protocol at will, unless a consensus is reached between a majority of miners and nodes. 
this is why the eventual conclusion is as i wrote: a short-list of "key nodes" that can handle high traffic and download an 8GB block within a blink of the eye, verify it, and relay to dozens of slammer nodes and home user's nodes who are slower to receive blocks, but confirm the validity after a slight delay.
the "big blocks = centralisation" argument is flawed in this way, because you are not turning bitcoin into a centralized currency, a larger block simply requires the understanding that geographically-relevant and technologically-capable nodes will be responsible for feeding many 'slower' nodes. 
(think of P2P downloads - there's always that one peer/seed who gives you 3x the speed of any other seed/peer, but you still know the file is decentralised)

*advance notice im assuming numbers out of my ass here*
there must be 1000+ datacenters around the world that have fiberoptic G*B*PS (not Gb) connections, and thousands of home users who have access to Gbps fiber networks. if bitcoin scales to worldwide, these are the nodes that will run the network - even if only a small fraction of them operate a node
IMO throttling bitcoin so that slow nodes can keep up isnt the right way to do things. Netflix didnt hold off on 4K streaming just because not everyone has the &gt;30Mbps network needed, and neither should bitcoin
(an example of the cedar supercomputer with dual 100Gbps fiber, backed up by dual 40Gbps fiber

admittedly, im a little bit under-informed on the lightning network so if it doesnt have similar space/bandwidth usage as bitcoin forgive my first sentence.
as for the rest of the post, i dont see how its 'bad'. It seems obvious that major networking datacenters would be the ideal place to operate a full node thats capable of downloading, verifying, and broadcasting thousands of transactions a second. (its not like the visa network is run on a single machine out of an office in southern wyoming). If you want there to be thousands of cryptocurrency transactions/second you need to be moving all that data through the fastest route (ie: fibre/satellite hubs, and cable/dsl spokes)

The DAO was based on issues within the ethereum code, while the parity bug was related to L2-esque programming by Parity.
With DAO, the code itself enabled the theft, and "code is law" caused the ideological eth/etc split. In the case of parity, the flaw resulted in the codelaw being (essentially) deleted
DAO was explicit theft where a fork was used to stop the thief benefitting and return the funds. Parity simply lost the coins by making them stuck in a nonexistent contract.
There's no immediate need to rush for a solution here since the coins can't be moved by anyone right now. Including a fix in the next major update of ethereum can be done easily and without contention.
That said, people need to know what they are getting into when they put currency into untested contracts by a development group (parity) that's got a history of bad code review. A few more fuck ups like this and maybe ethereum will stop bailing out bad user investments

only when an attack is feasible. its extremely likely that microtransactions (&lt;$0.03) will never be a major use of bitcoin. That lesson was learnt a while back with the dice sites filling blocks with miniscule betting amounts.
internal transactions (like repeat betting on a gambling site) do not need to occur on the public blockchain ledger. They could occur on private ledgers that are ammended to the blockchain at specific intervals (reducing transaction fees and bloating)

you started strong but lost me when you listed off a few devices that you think can handle bitcoin but only small amounts.
why cant i make a $10,000 purchase with my phone, ideally using a secure hardware wallet like a trezor/ledger? In bitcoin a $1 transaction shouldnt be any less secure than a $1000 one.
you want trustless, run a node of your own. but a lot of people would rather use SPV and trust a long whitelist of full nodes. YOU can be as trustless as you like while letting other be as trusting or untrusting as they feel is convenient and secure to them
At this point i dont use a full node for my wallet - i use trezor and thier web interface because i trust them and the security of my trezor. And its not a hot wallet so its not vulnerable to many attack vectors that a full node/wallet is

I tend to agree. growth is absolutely necessary, but it needs to be at a pace thats consistent with technological progress. (ie: doubling every 2-4 years)
however, the issue is userbase growth. if bitcoin were to *somehow* pass $400, there could be an increase in new users and higher transaction volume. Such an increase in particiation could exceed 200%/year and for that reason you need a maxblocksize limit thats at least 2-3x higher than the typical blocksize.

Well your edit is the other half of the problem. To send a legacy coin to a segwit address still costs a legacy fee, so segwit benefits take a while to kick in, and only for those receiving to segwit wallets.
Eg: my cold storage trezor balances are all on legacy addresses still. So I'll have to pay a legacy fee to send them no matter how or when I do.
(Or I could pay a large legacy fee to regroup them all into a segwit address, and then pay a secondary segwit fee whenever I send those coins the second time - which is likely more then just doing the legacy transactions)

So how much space would this 1MB have required if it eventually got fit into multiple blocks instead? 2MB? 5MB? more?
Doing this raised some complications and exposed flaws in some clients - but it effectively wiped out a massive backlog of 'dust' (which totalled only a fraction of a bitcoin, at 0.0001btc/ea) in a single slightly-trickier-to-verify transaction. Seems like a workable solution to 'dust' if miners can occasionally clear the bloat.
...so long as theres no situation where enough dust can result in multiple slow-to-verify blocks by a mining attack. If blocks take sufficiently long to propogate, a small (2-3 block) fork may be possible

Pretty much Hit on the head.
One of the issues is that multiple core devs are involved in projects like Block stream or lightning, which seek to provide ways of conducting transactions outside the blockchain (presumably Subject to fees that the developers/company will get)
Realistically, there's around 500-600kb/block of 'necessary' transactions right now, but on peak periods we see the 1mb limit being hit, and low fee transactions are subjected to a longer waiting time. If bitcoin was at peak usage, this would be fine (maybe even ideal) - but if we saw another 10x leap in value and users there might be 5mb of transactions every 10min, with only enough space to include 1mb on the blockchain. Fees will skyrocket until only those paying &gt;$2/transaction can actually submit content to the blockchain. 
...or the limit could be increased so the blockchain is usable by anyone, at fees &lt;$0.25/tx

Benefit is use on systems where you want to have a functional bitcoin core with as little as 1gb of space use. It is also capable of running a wallet afaik

Ive seen the proposal and I like it - but it consists of three things:
1) major hardfork in how miners are paid for blocks and including transactions with a sort of 'rollover wallet'
2) dynamic, voted block soft cap, with a hard cap of 2x that.
3) dynamic penalties imposed for exceeding the soft cap.
Personally, I see a lot of value in the 3rd function, but not 1&amp;2. The limit should be mathematical (finite, or predetermined growth rate) and not susceptible to miner influence. implementing this sort of change would significantly alter how miners are paid for work
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:18:07
so what's your plan? leave bitcoin with its crippling 2txps limit?
that can barely sustain the network anymore as it is. the majority of blocks are now &gt;60% full and many are &gt;80% full.
the 1MB limit is 6 years old, and was a temporary anti-spam measure. theres now other methods of combating spam transactions and the limit needs to be removed (or changed to a new larger, adaptable limit)
@_date: 2015-07-09 01:18:48
Litecoin IS somewhat immune:
1) it can handle 4x the tranaction volume (1MB every 2.5min)
2) (paraphrasing here) "presumably" basic protection exists in litecoin that filters/prevents spam
but when the FUD clears and bitcoin is patched i think we will see a lot of value move LTC-&gt;BTC

^what miners are going to start filling 8MB blocks? 
its already known that the biggest miners in china are not as well-connected (ping-wise) as most of the central european or north american miners. Large blocks are equally harmfull/harmless to all miners - if blocks began being &gt;4MB anyone serious about mining would likely invest in faster broadband connections to reduce orphan blocks.
I'm open to a proposal that serves a middle ground (such a 4MB, doubling every two years) - but the point is that blocks are now commonly &gt;50% full with legitimate transactions. Its not hard to see 10-fold demand for bitcoin in the next year or two, and that would cripple the network and only serve to promote faster altcoins or sidechains.
Theres no visible reason why bitcoin could not handle a minimum of 2MB/block right now. But we want a solution that is permenant, and wont require a hardfork every year or two to cope with growth

i dont understand your sources for info:
1) chinese miners dont magically benefit from a larger or full block. If anything, they commonly have less transactions included than many other pools. What you suggest sounds like chinese miners will include 8MB of junk in the hopes that they can broadcast a full block, and then try to be the first to follow up on it while everyone else downloads. Fact is that will only mean a few seconds of latency (at most) for the majority of other miners. Any miner big or small could basically overcome this by having faster internet connection with &lt;1MBps down
2) ANY PROPOSAL IS IN THE HANDS OF MINERS. they include or disclude transactions. the entire backbone of BTC is that they are paid fees for their distributed computations. You can increase the limit to 8MB and they are capable of deciding to only make 200kb blocks in order to induce a stronger fee market. Raising the current 1MB limit simply allows bitcoin to handle roughly 10x the current level of daily transactions without bottlenecking.
3) read the proposal. the blocksize will start at 8MB (likely wont see any published blocks &gt;1.5MB for a while still or if someone 'tests' it out, which could be refused by miners as spam/dust) and will DOUBLE every two years. If you have 1MBPS down now, you'll want to consider 2MBPS in two more years. If you only have a 40GB harddrive in your bitcoin node, you might want to invest in an 80GB harddrive, and then in two years perhaps a 160GB harddrive.
^all these things cut thier price in half roughly every two years. Its entirely feasible.
also, the limit will cap at 8GB in ~20yrs. Is it hard to imagine downloading 1GBps in 20 years, or having a 10TB harddrive with 16GB of ram to handle a bitcoin node? At that point there's no more planned increases and a hardfork is necessary to set the limit higher or lower

@_date: 2015-07-22 11:24:24
well maybe im missing out on the other side of the debate.
seems clear that blocksize has grown to the point that we now see many blocks that are full, or at least &gt;750kb. If a 5x price/adoption bubble occurs then its clear the mempool will spiral out of control and fees will triple or more as users fight to get transactions published within the SAME DAY.
the other side of the argument is that internet speeds and node distribution cannot keep up with increase in transactions/second if the blocks are sized sufficiently to allow "free" (&lt;0.0001btc/kb) transactions. I call bullshit on this, as the affected miners can establish soft limits and filter transactions as they choose. Most major miners have access to fiber or satellite connections that are drastically faster than previous DSL/cable hookups, and the problem is more to do with node distribution than the size of the blocks.
at minimum, we need to move to 2MB as a stopgap. 8mb, doubling every 2yrs seems like a better and hopefully permenant solution that save us from entering this arument again every time a new arbitrary blocksize limit is being maxed out

i know the one you're talking about i beleive - something to the extent that a miner could focus on creating a 'secret fork' thats filled to the brim (lets say 8mb). If they could beat the 'normal' chain by a block or two, it would be all sent at once to a controlled fast group of nodes with the goal to spread it and quickly make it the 'true' blockchain.the end result being that you orphan other miner's blocks 
if bitcoin is to become a true global currency (ie: "common" for daily use in work, online payments, and banking) there will be a lot of transactions. Thousands more than right now (look at visa/MC as examples). The two ways forward are that we either assume the blockchain will contain EVERYTHING, or we assume that the blockchain will only see transactions &gt;0.1BTC and there will be dozens of sidechains operated by either banks or telecoms (where decentralised mining and an open ledger may not be seen).
1MB was just an arbitrary value chosen long ago (6yrs, or 3 doubling periods by the logic). thus far, we haven't even seen any ill effects of filling it to that limit (other than increased fees). Sure, we could do something like 2MB, doubling every 4 years. but is that sufficient? will we be here in 2 years with BTC&gt;$1000 and 5x the current volume and be forced into creating a new hardfork?
the protection against these attacks is hashrate. hashrate is related to the value/(daily volume) of bitcoin. A more secure network relies on a valuable bitcoin

thanks for those links (where did you obtain them from? - a lot of these whitepapers are discussed but links rarely provided)
the block-discarding attack as described predominately makes use of near-empty blocks on a controlled network of super-fast nodes. The attack is much less effective if you assume a similar situation but rapidly relaying 8MB blocks. As I mentioned, the worst-case scenario for that would be that major miners in north america and china both centralize around fiber networks and attempt to propogate the longest chain. IMO this isnt very likely, and miners are better suited by investing in faster satellite relay to globally connect major nodes
difficulty raising attack: I read the whitepaper and i don't quite get it. an attacker simultaneously attempts to mine an entire section of blockchain (up to 2016 blocks), faster than the rest of the network 'normally' mines those blocks. I don't see how this attack would be made any more/less feasible through a larger block, as the attack vector suggests using an empty block (or substituting in whatever legitimate transactions you pre-approve at block 
as for block-withholding, im not sure how it applies. pool mining allows smaller miners to benefit from not requiring full node access, and only granted work values by the pool. the size of a block is completely irrelevant if the pool is in the afore-mentioned fiber network.
regarding the 8MB proposal - it only covers the next 20yrs. Moore's law is 50yrs old and still essentially true. satellite and fiber communications are keeping up the pace. but by 2040 bitcoin could see itself in the same place as now where the 8GB cap is being rapidly approached and this discussion is reborn.

The current 1MB limit is almost six years old now. if it had been doubling every two years we'd be at 8mb now and this whole blocksize debate would't exist.  blocks HAVE TO be bigger than they are now, and the 8MB doubling every two years proposal is a solid one. Even if implemented today it could take several more months until blocks &gt;1.5MB appear within it

I like letting the market decide. Cryptocurrency wasn't made so that companies or governments can control people's payment or investment options.
If a coin has merit it will succeed. If it's a copycat or lacks a strong development team, then it probably wont.

this. the mining rewards follow a very specific curve thats set in stone, and determines the economic future of mining
meanwhile, the 1MB cap on blocksize is completely arbitrary and was put in place several years ago (when transaction volume was 10% what it is now) as a spam filter.
now, miners employ their own filters and soft limits, and the network generally only relays transactions that meet a minimum fee of 0.0001BTC
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:52:21
AFAIK it will aggregate the split coins from each xpub *series* of addresses.
but if you have multiple passwords to your trezor, each with multiple seperate xpub 'accounts', youll have to split once for each of them. 
it took me about 10min at most to get all my BCH from about 5 different xpub accounts (under a few different passwords), and send it all to a new singular address on the trezor.
tldr; no. all change addresses are all split simultaneously by splitting a single 'account' on the trezor

Block stream. Lightning. Any side chain whose entire premise is "the blockchain is bloated - use us for cheaper".
The simple fact is that 1mb is an arbitrary limit from 6 years ago. Since then average block size has grown drastically and the effects are now visible. If it continues transactions will cost &gt;0.001btc/kb and eventually serve no benefit against swift/paypal/any other payment system that charges fees.
Disclosure: I support 8mb doubling every two years. The 2mb proposal is also good, but simply a stopgap

Miners don't need to fill blocks. They could easily decide to relay only transactions with a minimum fee (as is done now).
Block size was 1mb 6 years ago, and there were few (if any?) full blocks until recently. Most were &lt;0.1mb.

Nya with 99% miner signalling of s2x looked like a pretty damningly strong consensus, enough to plan an activation date around with several months of lead time. There's been some learning experiences since, and the consensus has been shown to be much more contentious than the PoW hashrate suggested, and it looks like it will be a failed fork at this rate. 
Bitcoin wasn't designed to be governed. Anyone can code and deploy a fork, letting the market, nodes, and miners determine it worth.

Personally, I lean towards Gavin's proposal (link is dead though?) and think its the best way forward. a 32MB cap would seem massive today but put us back in the current boat within 4-8 years. With a maximum of 8GB in 20 years, it seems entirely feasible that most dedicated bitcoin nodes will include 10TB drive space, 64GB ram, and a 1GBps internet connection.  All that would be available at a similar cost to right now buying a 64GB, 1GB ram, 1MBps system today ($168 
The claims that chinese megamines will somehow manipulate the industry by filling blocks to the brim with 'spam/dust transactions' are unfounded, as the same effect would happen in north america where many major miners will have low ping. The worst case scenario is that there could be orphan CHAINS between major mining nodes. It would harm everyone, and be easily solved by investing in communications infrastructure such as satellite nodes ( or fibre networks. This is happening already as the world goes online.
@_date: 2015-08-23 20:41:11
the best method of decentralization is for bitcoin price to increase more rapidly than the difficulty (or deployment of new hardware).
for example, if bitcoin went through a 5x price increase over the span of 2-3 months, its unlikely that new hardware production will be able to keep up. older gear (such as 1w/GH) will become profitable again, and virtually anyone will be able to mine profitably at home.
however, if/when equilibrium is approached several months later, that inefficient hardware will turn back off, and those who have cheap power will have made the most profits and be able to expand thier operations further.
@_date: 2015-07-23 00:01:17
tldr; the way the blocksize change will be enforced will require that to 'change' the rules, you need 950 of the last 1000 blocks to match the existing size rules while also declaring themselves prepared for the changeover, before the change is enforced.


95% rule ("Point of no return"): If 950 of the last 1,000 blocks are version 2 or greater, reject all version 1 blocks. (testnet3: 75 of last 100)

realistically, bitmain has succeeded largely due to thier access to cheap electricity at multiple locations. so has bitfury.
only one currently sells miners in small/medium quantities though. So to accuse bitmain of being the centralizing problem is bad logic. If anything, 90% of independant miners are likely using bitmain gear because bitmain DOES sell to the public.
as for empty blocks, it is a matter of incentives. if a transaction backlog arises, fees will increase to a point where the fees are worth more than the efficiency boost.
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:50:15
And the other 99% will completely disregard. All you've done is create an altcoin. The value of a transaction done on this fork would be tiny, as the same coins would still be available to spend on the main blockchain.

75% is a tad low, and 90% is several tads too high.
persoanlly 80-85% is the sweet spot of 4:1 or 6:1 consensus which establishes a clear supermajority without allowing changes to be veto'd a stubborn minority.
there will always be someone who doesnt want the change (or simply doesnt vote, which has the same result), so the burden of supermajority has to be difficult (&gt;75%) yet reasonable (&lt;85%).
that said, its not like a 75% supermajoity triggers overnight. it will take weeks or months for onramping miners to that point, and then theres a 4week 'countdown' to activation
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:09:16
there isnt a huge amount of incentive, but if you already have a node with ~5GB of blockchain downloaded to it, why not simply hold another 60gb?

techicalities? i posted a wiki link - thats as basic as you get.
btc/core and btc/classic are 95% the same open-source code, and in the casde of a network fork both are based on the same blockchain up to the future point of fork. THATS THE VERY DEFINITION OF A FORK.
if you dont think 75% trust it and will switch, nothing happens. your world stays just the way it is.
and yes, right now btc/core has majority consensus based on mining and node count. but that *can change, and btc/classic is presenting a code change that a lot of people want (whether or not they switch is secondary)
in the case of a fork, the 'smart' move for btc/core is to release a 2mb version of its software. both will now be compatible on the &gt;1m blockchain, and if rolled out in time 95%+ of the network should be compatible with the bigblocks side of the fork when it triggers.
there may be a few individuals with special interests on both sides of the discussion, but theres a growing consensus that scaling is necessary, and that consensus should be used so that everyone stays on the same blockchain. that means segwit +2mb should arguable be deployed within the next 8-12 months to effectively triple the current network capacity
look at the BIP101/2mb code - its well written by an excellent developer(s) who are not currently on the core/blockstream team. These are the sort of guys who you want working together to create a blockchain that both clients can use harmoniously, rather than arguing over the semantics of how the smaller side of a fork will survive without merging the compatible BIP/pull requests, with some even suggesting silly methods like PoW change.
its a vote system. right now btc/classic has 0% of the hashrate vote and as such nothing is expected to happen for some time. so stop worrying. IF/when &gt;75% of hashrate does support the change, thats capitalistic-democracy in action.
@_date: 2017-04-12 21:15:00


I can't tell if you are referring to BU or Core - both consist of a mostly-unique group of primary developers with different opinions of how to scale bitcoin.
in either case, calling a client centralized is mostly pointless, as its the bitcoin protocol which is the only thing that needs to be decentralized. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:47:56
blocks do not need to always be full. we went a full 5+ years without blocks being consistently full. to say this is a reason against increasing the limits is silly, since a full 2mb block is better than a full 1mb block fee-wise
right now there isnt space because none is provided by the maxblocksize, not because miners or nodes are actively deciding to not relay blocks &gt;XMB  (which is easy, look at bitcoin unlimited, which would essentially allow a miner to make a large block, while accepting a high risk that it will not propogate quickly and/or be ignored by nodes that only relay blocks below the size they can handle

It's only a fork if bitcoin-xt starts publishing blocks &gt;1mb.

so lets assume for a minute that opt-in RBF is ideal and works wonderfully for transactions where the network is busy, a wrong address was used, or the fee was too low.
whats the flipside? not necessarily opt-out (as thats just a 'regular' transaction, and miners have incentive to choose the highest fee), but something more strongly defined as IRREVERSIBLE such that zero-conf safety is guaranteed.
(other than in situations involving a malicious miner who still mined only the double-spend - which would be extremely unlikely is a decentralised network where the double-spender does not personally control significant (say &gt;10% chance of mining the block) hashrate.) Of course this moves into the territory of forcing miners to follow a code rule rather than the incentive of a higher fee

Running an alternative client is 'rational'. It's not like running a classic node will immediately cause network collapse.

brass will generally tarnish (form a patina) and its mostly unavoidable. the key to a brass collectible coin is that the tarnish must be even, because things like fingerprints and such can cause visibly uneven tarnish and reduce the value.
silver coins are much more resistant, but can lose shine overtime, just like jewellery or silverware.
best bet for both is to get airtight capsules (ebay is fine) and put the coins in those. Its pretty muc the same as having ANACS slab them (but not as tamper-proof), and costs maybe $1/case rather than $15-30/coin for actual grading services.
im in canada, so to send my silver/gold coins to anacs would be more costly and involve cross-border shipments which could increase cost and/or risk. Instead i capsuled them myself using a pair of lab-grade nitrile gloves (arguably better than cotton gloves for safe coin handling and to prevent leaving marks or oil behind) and plan to old onto them long-term. if/when they are valuable enough to justify paying a higher cost for safe and professional grading ill get it done (such as if they became worth $5000/ea it would easily justify taking them to a grading service in person to maintain the security)

I believe that if bitcoin fees exceed $0.25 for a basic transaction, there is a problem with the fee market.
bitcoin might not handle small purchases and payments, but even as a settlement layer that deals with &gt;$100 transactions it would need to scale drastically to handle hundreds or thousands of transactions per second within the next 10-20 years
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:58:24
its not an immediate process anyways.
1) 0.11.2 RC only came out a few days ago
2) classic 0.12 is expected in a few weeks
3) classic nodes dont even have mining at this point
4) classic nodes now make up about 18% of the network. Even if it never grows to the 75% (OF MINED BLOCKS) required for a fork, it 'plays nicely' with core and acts just like a core node would
theres so much FUD on both sides, that it really boils down to this: classic poses no threat unless it has 75% support from nodes and miners, and treating the fact it "failed" as a celebration is pretty pointless.
having multiple implementations that work together is a good thing. its comparable to cellphones - what if apple manufactured 90%+ of all phones on the market, and only t-mobile was available as a carrier? having compatible options creates diversity

We saw how the automakers responded to the rise of tesla and in some states used the law to bar them from having physical dealerships because the rise of an efficient competitor was a threat to the core business of gasoline engines.

this - visa has no competition (besides mastercasrd, and together they may as well have a price cartel), and therefore its reasonable that they could have lower fees in the future if they needed to compete with bitcoin.
I dont think bitcoin is going to be the go-to for micropayments, and that sidechannels like lightning will be better suited to immediate-confirmations and situations where users/IoT/apps expect to make dozens or hundreds of small transactions monthly.
but that doesnt mean bitcoin should be an overpriced settlement layer. even as the block subsidy decreases, bitcoin should not need to charge "high fees" (whatever your definition is, I say $0.25/basic transaction is the upper ceiling that i think could be kept below by safely increasing blocksize and other scaling features.
that its even $0.04 right now, only 6 years in, is a telling sign that the current block capacity is perhaps being reached a bit faster than necessary

I'm not super informed on the relay network, but my understanding is it is mostly beneficial to miners and not so much regular nodes. Thin blocks should also be much simpler to implement as a part of the client, as opposed to a separate peer network like relay uses.

hard to call it "pure junk", but even so your definitions of a better metric show that transaction volume doubled in the past year and still constitues ~50% of overall transactions.
so best case scenario, in 1 year from now 1mb blocks will be completely filled with "non-junk" if transaction volume doubles. realisticlaly, i dont think excluding long chains manages to prove anything since some sites and services rely on shifting small transactions frequently (such as a trading platform or gambling site)
@_date: 2016-02-04 18:41:06
isnt an easy solution to flag any peers who have downloaded more than [50-80]GB, ie the full blockchain, and begin throttling their speeds respectively? If a single node/peer needs more data than a full blockchain and a realistic amount of transaction relays its likely a sign that there may be some misuse like the constant mempool requests you mention.
Whats the realistic data requirements of relaying/checking EVERY transaction in the mempool per block (to 1 peer)? Add that to the size of the entire blockchain (assume it could be a brand new node), and add 5-10% overhead to avoid undeserved throttling.
at 150% of the limit, throttle it by 30%. at 200% of the limit, throttle it by 60%. at 300% of the limit, throttle it by 80%. at 500% of the limit, throttle further or close the connection to that peer. Doing this would have capped OP's peer at about 300-500GB instead of just feeding them 5-10x that amount
This all assumes that we can keep track of that particular peer (ie they cant reconnect with a disguise), and distinguishing multiple nodes at a single IP address like at a university campus or office building where there could be dozens of different nodes with different owners. My technical understanding gets blurry with regards to this though so i hope im not generalizing too much

upvoted because its a good answer to OP's question, but I have to disagree
right now, 1mb blocks are fairly easy to validate and relay in reasonable timespan (&lt;25 seconds for most), but there are some exceptions where a single transaction has a large number of signatures in it and can take exponentially more time to process. IIRC one block that had &gt;950kb as a single transaction took over a minute for slower nodes to process. Scaling up to 2+MB without precautions against a similar 2mb single-transaction could take over a minute even on fast nodes, and this is unacceptable. The problem would worsen with larger blocksizes under this vulnerability, and could require much stronger CPU/RAM to actually run nodes
HOWEVER, thats avoidable with a few things. A simple one is to limit the size of single transactions to something like 250kb. Others include making signature validation an *option* with segwit, or improving validation speeds with libsec256k by a factor of almost 7x, or even ideas like thinblocks that allow much faster relay.
2MB is a reasonable blocksize for 2016, and we should expect it to grow in the future. If segwit and  thinblocks were enabled, 4MB in 2017 would likely be a safe proposition.
bitcoin will naturally centralise as difficulty increases (and thus only miners who can keep their costs low will run big farms where electricity is cheap), the blockchain grows in size&amp;complexity (eventually it will reach a point where sub-$100 computers will be unable to manage full-validation and require mempool/blockchain pruning), and sidechain activity could mean massive increases to bandwidth usage if there is major adoption. That's unavoidable in the big picture though, as bitcoin becomes a trillion-dollar market

not all sidechains will be decentralised though. If the liquid (or LN, or whatever other upcoming ideas) network has a fee structure, blockstream will be the first to the party and thus attempt to be the dominant 'service' that makes bitcoin "easier"/"faster"
my vague understanding of lightning (and its incomplete routing method?) is that fees effectively go to nodes/witnesses because there is no mining involved. (correct me if im wrong). As such, blockstream could situate itself predominately with high-speed server hubs to produce fees.
but its hard to avoid seeing this as a conflict of interest for those working on blockstream for payment, and simultaneously in bitcoin development. It has great potential for better development, but also potential for misuse by creating conditions that drive users to blockstream unnecessarily.

i agree. at this point we are still a few years from the separation of client and protocol i think, though it is an ideal goal.
for now having each client define the protocol is simply the easier method, because of how the dev teams are currently aligned (core upholds thier version of protocol/client, whereas classic is pushing for a protocol change *via* modified client)
AFAIK both clients are virtually identical in the UI/UX?

then it comes down to companies and miners making the decision. and we already know where the exchanges, L2 service, and hardware devs (bitmain and bitfury/21.co) stand
how do you account for actual users (the people this is supposed to represent), rather than simplifying it to "we have this list of companies who signed a statement"?

I apologize (i think), my point was that libsec256k1 is an excellent advance in reducing how long it takes to do signature validation, which offers across-the-board benefits for nodes and wallets.
one of these is that the greatly reduced time and cpu-usage creates a much greater headroom for how many transactions can be processed/validated by a node per second, which up to now has been a key argument against scaling and the fear of hard-to-validate blocks that could take several minutes on some nodes.
AFAIC, this is a big step towards enabling scalability (increased blocksize is just a key example)

Bitfury advertises 0.1w/GH at chip level, and at speeds a bit lower than what most users wll use initially (closer to the efficiency of the 1.03 PUE container DC;  which is ~12PH/1.5MW (0.125W/GH)
BW claims 0.16w/gh (at chip or in circuit?) in the first revision, and 0.95w/GH for the upcoming second revision.

the core roadmap has some great stuff on it (like segwit) that will improve transaction speeds/capacity, and overall improve wallet validation speeds.
however, these alone do not suffice and realistic blocksize growth HAS to become part of the roadmap, with proper wallet-signed messages from developers and major entities to find actual consensus on a specific date or blockheight for the change, even if it means occuring [soon] after segwit.
hard forking is a necessary measure when there is an incomplete consensus - its a part of the open-source nature of the blockchain, and the economic incentives of mining control this (miners need to do whats profitable, which includes bending to user demands)
so yes, I am pro segwit AND 2MB

i dont like the idea of trying to block an optimization though, particularly when its pushed by nullc in what seems like the next step in his grudge against bitmain's lack of segwit support.
compared to the adoption of gpus (10x+ boost), then fpga (5x+ boost), then 55nm (~5x boost), then 28nm (~4x boost), now 16nm (2.5x boost) - a simple code optimization (20% boost) really isnt that much difference.

you're right - i was hasty and just assumed GPU architecture was close to what CPUs (or asics) achieve. I would have been better to say "noone makes a 55nm gpu anymore" or something to that extent.
but i think the more mportant factor is that sha256 hashing has undergone a major tecnological advancement in the past 2-3 years, but has now caught up to some of the best possible technology. Its unrealistic to see ASICs &lt;14nm for a while, and moving to 10nm or smaller is still largely unseen even by intel/amd.
to double the efficiency of 14nm, you need ~10nm. to double the efficiency of that is ~7nm. to quote wikipedia:  it is likely 4-6 years away

how hard is it to understand that these "signed statements" are almost totally useless? weve seen them for both classic, core, and XT before, and often the signers have switched opinions or different people in a single company have different opinions.
pools have very little control over their miners, who could simply decide to mine elsewhere if they are determined to dedicate hashpower towards a pool running classic
you say classic is unethical for trying to drum up support, yet this very reddit link is to a core-sponsored "drumming up of support". Both sides are using the same tactic here
names mean nothing. you need to demonstrate a hashpower vote (or lack of) to show TRUE miner support, and/or provide wallet-signed messages if you want to demonstrate economic support of your bitcoin holdings. Everyone wants bitcoin scaled, and there are multiple ways to do it that are under develop currently.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:04:32
Miners have the incentive to keep their network fuctional, but otherwise I agree. Even today there's no incentive to spend $100 on an rpi w/ hdd or $300 on a i3-based node.
Imo POS or a similar mechanism where staking coins in an active node might help, and if LN nodes are going to charge fees that could also be incentive.
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:46:42
up until the actual fork, theres only a single blockchain with its typical difficulty. the moment the fork happens is when theres two blockchains with thier own independant hashrates/difficulties
in other words, the incentive to switch over quickly begins once the countdown to forking initiates. until that point, miners will probably move their hashrate over at a leisurely pace so as to better monitor and understand the consensus migration
@_date: 2016-02-12 15:28:06
its a load of bullshit in that article, not sure how the guys a lawyer.
open-source code does not require FINcen/aml. A fork would use the exact same SHA256 protocol for creating the currency, which is done by miners (who already should be complying with laws and taxes) - not the developers.
if anything, the mumurs of core changing PoW would be 10x as suitable for the ficticious crimes explained in the article


anyone who knows what they are doing and uses and updated wallet will clearly know the difference between coins in both forks. This is like saying that someone might sue you for giving them USD when they expected canadian dollars. presumably they will leave the store without checking what you gave them (maybe its monopoly money), and then go to a lawyer to resolve in court whats basically thier own neglience


so much of this is just wrong. without consensus, the change does not even enact. it only enacts if &gt;75% of miners move over, which is an extremely active method of demonstrating consensus.
this all boils down to the biggest problem: Core seems determined to not join the majority consensus if it moves to &gt;1mb blocks. they could easily patch in the 2mb code and maintain compatibility on the new longest blockchain, but instead they talk about how to survive with &lt;25% hashrate or even changing the PoW entirely so that 100% of miners will move to the new &gt;1mb blockchain

@_date: 2015-07-07 18:07:48
They absolutely do. How are you supposed to do sha256 encryption of the transactions unless you actually have said list of transactions?
SPV mining effectively produces empty blocks because no transactions are downloaded to add to the block.
In pooled mining the pool operator downloads the list, and effectively communicates the nonce requests to the small individual miners (who do NOT need to download all the transactions)
@_date: 2016-02-20 22:08:40
what part of the timeline is optimistic? I was surprised that its expected to take a year for hardfork activation - realistically i wanted to see 6-9 months  based on the way this plan is portrayed as consensus.
overall though its a step in the right direction
@_date: 2016-02-21 20:25:01


that oversimplifies it. even if three big pools simultaneously began mining classic blocks, you are looking at several days to meet the activation threshold, and 3+ months after to actually fork. 
realistically, a lot of miners (particularly those with enough hashrate to be paying close attention) would move away to non-classic pools, if for no reaon other than to push back the activation until a "true" consensus of individual miners (and not pool operators) make the decision
@_date: 2016-02-15 05:41:07
i disagree that having multiple clients will somehow break the consensus mechanism.
different clients and dev teams are fine as long as they always maintain compatibility with a shared bitcoin code. Its not like a dev team will release an uncompatible update (forks not withstanding, as long as fungibility and supermajority are maintained)
@_date: 2017-04-12 22:11:31
a chain split isnt necessarily something you can avoid (such as orphan blocks and the short chains that may build upon them)
I don't want a split with anything less than a clear 85%, and ideally a more broadly-accepted 95%. 
and until they reach that level of support, changes to protocol rules should not be triggered by clients. But that doesn't mean its wrong to pursue and develop code that modifies or extends how bitcoin works.
 It just means it would be wrong for a group of miners to simultaneously force the rule change (which may not even be accepted by the other clients if the 95% trigger wasnt seen first). 
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:06:06

the largest bitcoin pool?
the largest (or one of) independant miner?

seems like there are several simple solutions that would amount to limiting the number of signatures in a transaction (but could impede/harm sidechain development), or simply creating a maximum transaction size (such as &lt;25kb)
any reason why either of these fairly simple solutions couldnt work?
ps: segwit is quite nifty and promises solutions to this. however the simpler solution is sometimes the best (compared to re-writing how transactions are created and storing data in 'secondary' data blocks)

i support core roadmap COMBINED with a hardfork blocksize increase.
BIPs are a meaningful part of code development. BIP101 was excellent working code for a consensus size increase, but was not implemented and failed to show sufficient support. Its removal by the author is responsible good code work

imagine a transaction occurs - where the sender relays it to nodes A,B,C, which propogates to (DEF),(GHI),(FJK) respectively, and so on, until someone propogates it to the client/node that receiver uses. Te receiver should see the (unconfirmed) transaction fairly quickly, maybe 10 seconds.
Reducing this timespan makes rapid 0-conf transactions faster (ie: better UX)
The same goes for block transmission (actual conf), albeit with a larger file that takes longer to propagate as a result. 
For a majority of users this isn't a big issue, but there are a lot of use cases tat benefit from seeing 0-conf transactions propoagate as near-instantly as possible, as well as confirmations that result of validating a new block.
thin blocks is a pretty simple method of improving block propagation speeds
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:45:19
yeah your post was super constructive to having a conversation.
did i actually say segwit was bad? i said that pushing it as mandatory for any other sort of scaling (even a 2mb blocksize bump) wasn't right.

@_date: 2016-02-24 19:29:51
it isnt *un*reasonable *right now*
but this is for a day where blocks were basically filled entirely, so if transaction volume rises the effective "mimimum fee to be processed" will rise and the ECONOMICAL 21-40 sat/byte will increase to 31-50 sat/byte for transactions. without scaling, higher transaction volumes will mean more unprocessed transactions, and a higher minimum fee if you want it validated in &lt;2 blocks
@_date: 2017-04-01 23:32:46
i didn't say segwit, then softfork. i said both.  Ideally, both codes would be made available for miners to signal seperately (or together if desired), and let each activeate on its own when the consensus level (say 95%) is hit.
we need a way to make scaling easier, so we dont come to another 3+year argument when segwit+2mb is insufficient and we need to consider 4mb or more. EC puts a lot of power in miner's hands, but they already can limit blocksize if they chose - its really just the growth control that it gives them
I'll be the first to admit - im not a great programmer. at best i can craft some basic C++ scripts but thats about it. any pull request or code i submit would certainly have some flaws. But that doesnt make my thoughts and opinion without value.
we know there is 2mb code already existing (bitcoin calssic essentially) or several other similar BIPS listed here   
my point about core dragging thier feet is that there is 2MB (and other) codes already available - but unless core indicates support and releases a version of it under their name, the attempts of others to promote the code have just led to mudslinging and division that weve seen get worse over the past 2years.
let the network decide what to run by making it available to them now, rather than waiting until segwit reaches activation (its like saying "yeah, we'll do that when ethereum goes PoS"; its non-committal)

fair enough, it was the right thing to do. However, his response indicates that there may be other cases where the signing CEO might not actually represent the company, but rather a personal opinion on the roadmap.
all-in-all, its a good start, but at least KnC has made the small step to classic in order to demonstrate scaling support (classic is the default right now, but if core were to release code on the schedule defined, im sure that hashrate support would move there)

this isnt special - just using  "colored" (ie: token value transfer) coins to effectively create gold vouchers that are recorded on the blockchain.

doubtless that sidechains and build-ons (such as using the/a blockchain to broadcast share transfers in NYSE) will occur no matter what - but i beleive that bitcoin needs to be able to handle whatever traffic is thrown at it.
curious - are you a miner? centralisation is absolutely normal, and a function of capitalism. 3-4 years ago there were guys who had photos of operations where they ran dozens or hundreds of GPUs (possible on slightly-upgraded home circuit. Those guys now run warehouses with &gt;100TH because they are smart and saw potential to expand. 
decentrilization is driven by profit. if ANYONE can make a profit at almost any price of electricty, things will decentralise. If only places that have cheap power are profitable, it naturally centralises.
right now theres around 18BTC/day in fees (0.125BTC or 0.5% of reward). Its not expected that fees will make up &gt;10% for quite some time, let alone &gt;80%. theres still something like 30% of all bitcoins have yet to be generated and fees likely wont become prominent until at least 2020 (when block reward drops to 6.25BTC and there might be ~1BTC worth of fees) bitcoins miners can and will still choose to ignore low/zero-fee transactions no matter the blocksize limit. 
i think the cap should try to be kept within mathematical limitations, rather than creating a voting system between miners (which as you said are centralizing). 
perhaps a system with 4MB now, doubling every 2 years but with the rate of doubling adjustible (+/-25%) via miner vote? It would limit the ability for centralized miners to launch a short-term attack  by increasing size.
I still prefer the all-math version. Picture a computer in 20 years from now. is it hard to imagine that almost every component of it is 1000x faster than today? 1GBps download speeds don't seem unrealistic. most fiber networks can already offer 1Gbps connections and you could build a $1000 node thats got 6TB of space and 16gb of ram. In 20 years youll have access to twice that power at 1/10th the cost
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:12:17
That still boils down to "the only way you can increase blocksize is to pass segwit first"
Having different consensus seeking codes being flagged simultaneously isn't a problem - the worst case scenario is that one activates at 95%, and then that majority passes the next at 95%, leaving a very small minority (&lt;10%) that isn't valid.

exactly. bitcoin has a niche for high-value transactions, but it can do so much more, and having fees "reasonable" (what that means is open to how technology advances) is crucial, and largely a factor of scaling efforts.
25c is a complete arbitrary value (like 1mb), but it should be a slow increase to that sort of pricing, over the span of decades, not just a few years into the project because the limit is still at 2009's 1MB
there are certain transactions that would move to sidechains for better pricing, but there are others that simply benefit from the actual blockchain, and keeping fees down for these small-medium value transactions (such as buying a dvd online for $25) is critical for adoption. if its a 5c fee for that (0.2%), or if we start seeing 25c+ (1%) makes a big difference to this sort of purchase and whether to use bitcoin or visa
@_date: 2016-02-27 15:11:43
I tried to in the paragraph under the first line. By throttling your bandwidth you are purposely making propagation from your node much slower, which is not beneficial to the network. It's like turning your high-speed node into dialup-mode whenever it's time to propagate a new block and makes propagation SLOWER. Thinblocks does not require 1mb "bursts" every 10 min, and actually improves propagation speeds of blocks by 20-50x FASTER.
A good analogy is that you use Wikipedia a lot for work and have been browsing it all day and visited a few dozen pages. Now your boss gives you a list of 20 links he wants you to print out. You could go and download/print all those (which means downloading 20 webpages), or you could print directly from your browser cache for whichever links you were already visiting earlier, and only downloading ones you had not visited (which might mean you only need to download 1-2 links, saving you time and bandwidth)
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:37:01
i should clarify i dont have anything major against segwit as ive learned more and seen it scrutinized by many.
but the blockchain is designed to act as a sort of mathematical democracy, where new ideas can be introduced (through modified clients or at least flagging blocks/transaction messages) and formally recorded to the ledger.
I take offense to the "segwit ~~ONLY~~FIRST, then sometime after we will look at 2mb" message though. Why not release (or at least put for review) a 2mb code today and let miners begin to flag support. Let the flagging speak for itself and show how much support there is. 
If 2mb were to reach a 95% activation level faster than segwit, it majority forks and miners continue to flag segwit until/if it activates according to the mathematical democracy 
@_date: 2016-02-27 03:59:09
it levels out your bandwidt though.
right now, a node generally downloads/uploads every transaction, and then a solved block (which is typically just under 1MB).
with thinblocks, te node andles every transaction, but the solved thinblock is much smaller (~50kb) because it identifies mempool transactions so that your node can effectively build the block with everything it already had downloaded.
even if the bandwidth usage is  barely improved, it nearly eliminates the spikes caused by block propogation and drastically improves propagation speed as a result
@_date: 2015-07-30 01:45:07
21M is not arbitrary - its a specified quantity of all coins that will ever exist, the entire basis of BTC.
1mb was an arbitrary limit to prevent any possible &gt;3txps spam almost 6 years ago. at the time there was likely &lt;50kb of 'real' transactions as opposed to well over 500kb now, but the limit wasnt set to 100kb. it gave significant space

its your own quote, unless "GPU mining and what have you" meant something else.
its unlikely bitcoin will be $500 12 years from now, but even if it is miners will still use the most efficient machines available to them (might not be able to fund R&amp;D on &lt;10nm though). However, only the most low-cost operations will be able to survive making tiny daily profits, most others will have to stop mining because its using too much power/overhead and the difficulty will drop to a point where an equilibrium is reached in how many miners are making enough profit to operate equipment. With a block reward &lt;$2000 (including almost $1500 fees in your scenario), the network hashrate would probably have to be less than half of what it is now.
note this doesnt mean bitcoin breaks, but it does increase the vulnerability to attack compared to a strong exohash network. Realistically based on the next generation of ASICS i think we will have 200 exohash and $20,000/BTC by then, hopefully with &gt;$15,000 in fees (250 tps at $0.10 fees)    *just one outcome* That means 100x scaling in 12 years(or roughly 1.5x yearly growth rate)

the longer-term metric, particularly a corresponding decrease in btc/core nodes, is the key
faking nodes on either side of the spectrum serves no real benefits other than a sloppy network and pointless "im a node" votes.
hashrate is the reality and AFAIC this entire FUD saga is available by simply understanding that miners would be the ones to enforce a hardfork and that they have no incentive to rush blindly into it.
XT achieved what, ~1% of blocks mined? regardless of how many nodes there were, the key metric fell far short of the consensus requirement and the world never ended. let btc/classic do its publicity circuit without FUD and heavy moderation, and let the miners sit down and think about the economic incentives that drive their decisions. If theres 10x as much mining support as XT had, it would still fall short of the forkrules and the world wont end/change.

It absolutely is a conflict of interest, but thats more an ethical concern rather than actual misconduct so long as those who work in both realms make that known.
LN is a good idea, and i think will gain traction, but IMO the blockchain should not need to have fees that exceed ~$0.25 for a basic transaction, whereas sidechains will benefit ecommerce and micropayments mostly

outright rejection? try following through on basic scaling code thats been under discussion for 2-3 years (in various implementations such as 20mb, 8mb, 2-4-8mb, etc)
core has a good scaling roadmap, but i think thier plan to avoid hardforks and implement an extremely-new segwit before really giving much effort to actual maxblocksize is flawed.
if core were to try a 1.2mb maxblocksize right now and maintain the remainder of the roadmap im sure it would have consensus very quickly, if for no reason other than to see how a fork works in 2016 and to demonstrate a minimum goodfaith that the 1mb arbitrary limit isnt just the basis for blockstream's revenue system
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:46:20
I agree with this. Side chains are a good idea for small purchases and micro payments, but IMO putting a transaction into the blockchain should never exceed a cost of $0.50 for a basic transaction that is included within the next 2-3 blocks.
That would make bitcoin useful for most transactions &gt;$50 (&lt;1% fee) and a side chain can handle the thousands of transactions that are for things like coffee or micro payments

bitcoin is only traceable to the extent in which significant amounts move between addresses with little or no fragmentation.
ie: you steal 1BTC to 1abc..., and then move it later to 1bcd..., then use that address to buy stuff on websites where you piad in bitcoin but provided a shipping address or simply exposed your IP. this could be tracked to you (likely requiring police warrants or access to the websites you bought from)
IE you steal 1BTC to address 1abc..., then from there send 0.2BTC to 5 distinct addresses, that then each either put the coins through a mixing service (essentially makes hundreds of transfers that combine your coins with others, before outputting a mixture of coins from dozens of sources into a single output address for the value you put in the mixer). This is about as untrackable as you can get
option 3 is to let the coins sit at a known address and simply not move them. everyone will know what address holds them, but its impossible to tie you to that address if you used a secure method of generating it

regardless of asicboost, a lot of empty blocks simply arrise from spv mining or when a second block is found almost immediately after the first solution
its impractical to think the bitcoin network needs to (or is capable of) working together to roll out fixes that block optimized miners. what happens when bitfury or other miners come up with something thats 95% like asicboost but different enough that it works around nullc's current fix - will we have to go through another multi-week fudstorm to roll out another patch?
right now, fees on a block average around 12-15% of the subsidy. if asicboost is worth about 20% better efficiency than we are already not far from the tipping point at which the fees are more lucrative than empty blocks.
a 2mb block could mean that more transactions  (at lower fee/kb) could be put in a block and easily be worth more than the asicboost benefits for empty blocks

I've gotten some good responses to my criticism of uasf just being a fork by a nice name and dolled up a bit, and it's helped add perspective that I didn't have.
That said, it still feels like the fact that it's a soft fork is an excuse for the rules it would enforce, and that feels wrong.
We shouldn't rush something through if it lacks a super majority support from both miners and users. Active (friendly) discussion is the best way to make sure people are informed on the risk/benefits of stuff like segwit, uasf, AND HARD FORKS (like 2mb, emergent concensus, etc)

dareisay that neither of the acts by bitmain are particularly malicious? antbleed looks more like negligence, and asicboost is in the greyzone between legitimate hardware/software improvements and cheating because they don't allow their customers to use it
id argue that neither is particularly malicious. miners are incentivized to mine as many valuable bitcoins as possible, while maintaining the value of the currency through its usability and longevity. for bitmain to be orchestrating some sort of 'attack' would mean they spent millions in R&amp;D, just to throw it out the window for a brief period of mining dominance
if bitcoin ever reaches *MOON*, bitmain will be raking in more profit then they can even imagine today - its illogical for them to try and cripple it. if anything, they are incentivized to make it grow so that more users=more fees in the long run.

throttling your bandwidth is neutering your node.

there will be fees, particularly as the block subsidy decreases.

i dont disagree, but for every throttled node the overall network slows down slightly. If hundreds of nodes began using throttling you would likely start to see actual evidence of slower propagation.
tinblocks is a great and fairly simplistic solution thats already employed and working well (20-50x "compression" is common) in the BU client, and could easily become part of the core/classic scaling road maps as well.
If better solutions exist, thats amazing. but right now, thinblocks seems far better than throttling, while addressing the same (and other) issues

the block reward drops from 25btc to 12.5btc in just a few months, while transaction fees hover around 0.3-0.5btc/block.

the problem is that clients like bu or classic ARE compatible with core and the current consensus.
The only time they can become incompatible, is if the client's modified ruleset is triggered by hashpower voting (ie: a 95% supermajority trigger of classic or segwit) or flagday (blockheight or specific date, ie: august 1st for BIP148)
edit: a protocol change can be triggered early, but requires miners/nodes to not follow the trigger rule, and for enough to simultaneously do so. IMO, all this worry over premature forking is combative fud as opposed to constructive development

not sure your math is quite right either.


thats not much different than "if ROI *[on an empty block]* is 1%, fees equal to 15% of the block subsidy increases the ROI to 16%". I believe your calculations forgot to account the loss of subsidy when choosing a baseline for comparison.
also, your theoretical numbers are a bit off from what id consider (though it could vary wildly for each mining farm). In china power is cheap, and the S7 might match up with your 100/150 yuan example - but the S9 is more like a 100/400 yuan calculation, where the power savings generate a smaller, though still significant, ROI(%) boost.

the segwit size increase is only effective if transactions USE it. Realistically it would probably take several months to reach the point where 1/2 of transaction use segwit, creating 1.3-1.5MB "effective" blocks, with the full 1.6-2.0MB block estimate taking closer to a year to achieve (as it relies largely on multi-sig transactions such as in sidechains and LN)

How is a fork "not possible". The very purpose of classic is to work on the bitcoin sha256 blockchain. It's based on core 0.11.2 and as a node it's virtually identical other than its version name and the consensus code for 2mb.
If it does not reach super majority, nothing happens and it is simply another client with a distinct dev team, like introducing Google phones in a market dominated by apple.
If 75% of miners support classic (will take weeks or months to do so), then a process begins by which those miners will be able to produce blocks &gt;1mb. Core will have to either join the consensus or risk being &lt;25% weak side of the fork. 
Current bitcoin wallets are valid in both networks, which is why this is a fork and not an altcoin. If you wanted an altcoin that's not bitcoin and scales, look at ethereum and it's 400% price gain in the past month (although it's just a pump before the dump)
All you do is try to hurt the credibility of anything related to classic, which is just pointless.

arguably though, only 2/31 entities on that page said "yes" to "ready" and only 4/31 said "WIP". As such, of 31 supporters, 25 of them have actually done very little if anything, except pledge support to some extent.
even when they all use segwit, it relies on users updating their hardware or software for compatibility with multi-sig, if they even need more than singular point-to-point transactions. This rollout can take months or more due to varying levels of user interest and often-seen KISS logic that upgrading something like a trezor could introduce risks to an otherwise functioning wallet.
as such, i find it hard to see more than a ~1.4MB gain after 6 months of usage, and ~1.75MB after a year. If sidechains take off, maybe up to 2MB after a year

@_date: 2016-02-27 16:53:06
Depends on what your purpose of running a node is. If you simply want a copy of the blockchain "blocksonly" and/or throttling is a valid method.
But if you want to aid the network in being able to propagate new blocks quickly, throttling isn't good as it just means your peers won't see it for a few extra seconds. (which again falls to whether they should care, and so forth and so forth)
A good network means that almost all nodes are simultaneously updated with new blocks as they happen, and throttling defeats this goal. The network is (at its very best) as fast as the fastest node.
@_date: 2016-02-29 15:20:44
hashrate/difficulty is determined by ~3 main factors:   bitcoin price, bitcoins/block, and electricity/overhead costs.
If the block reward halves, ten hasrate would drop by at least 40% im guessing, as unprofitable equipment such as antminer s3/s5/(s7?) and the SP3x series are turned off and/or sold to collectors/scrap.
however, its realistic that with fewer bitrcoins minted every 10 minutes, demand (and price) will increase, and realistically there should be a sort of balance achieved by the shifting equilibrium.
finally, operating costs determines what is and isnt profitable. right now an S3 isnt profitable for those who pay &gt;$0.12/kwh, but for those who pay &lt;$0.05/kwh it still makes a little bit of mining income.
@_date: 2016-02-27 04:08:18
blocks-only reduces bandwidth usage by drastically reducing your node utility.
rather than propagating transactions (as part of the mempool), the only thing you propagate is solved blocks. It does nothing about the fact that propogating said block still requires you download 1MB and relay it.
with thinblocks, you propogate all unconfirmed transactions as usual, but the block solution is only ~50kb because it builds te 1MB block from the transactions you already ave in your mempool. propagation times for a solved block are massively improved by this
@_date: 2016-02-23 19:04:15
what does this mean for larger blocks?

@_date: 2016-02-27 03:49:19
not enough in teh community are humble, so thats neither-here-nor-there...
thinblocks is a step in the right direction for drastically improving propogation times of a solved block, as it can identify transactions in the mempool that were mined, and only a small amount of data (&lt;100kb usually, &lt;50kb is possible) is needed to propogate the solved block. Compared to ~950kb on a full block, this is a lot faster to download+upload
Thinblocks is one of several good ideas for improving propogation times and is only a small part of what will integrate into the various bitcoin clients over the coming years (others include segwit and the relay network)
theres two domains at stake: nodes which generally want low/steady bandwidth consumption, and miners which want block info ASAP and do not care about bandwidth or if it requires a few extra GB/month to be able to reduce the risk of orphans or wasted hashes
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:00:15
again, you seem to not follow the definition of a "fork" as it refers to open-source code. 
classic is a software fork that is 100% compatible with the bitcoin blokc chain. So is core.
If 75% of mined blocks are from classic, then an actual blockchain fork *can occur, where new blocks fall into one of two categories: including transactions from &gt;1mb blocks, and those that dont. this creates two chains of blocks that originate from a shared point in the blockchain.
it boils down to this: do you think that &gt;75% of miners will all actively redirect thier hashrate to classic and the 2MB 'vote'? If not, then stop worrying. if so, then you are in disagreement with the main hashing function of the bitcoin blockchain.
hardforks ARE consensus

centralization is a natural mechanism though, and its unavoidable. The basic principal is that if someone can profitably mine bitcoin at home (with an asic, or a gpu, or whatever), then another person can make a BIGGER profit by running 100x as much equipment with cheaper electricity cost.
the difficulty follows this increase in hashrate until the point where profits decrease across the board, and the least-profitable miners simply dont make sense to operate due to heat and costs. This is completely unavoidable in any PoW system. even in the most complex, asic-resistant, IP-specific (only 1 miner per IP), you will eventually have someone who is operating a warehouse with several dozen systems, all running through VPN/proxy, using cheap electricity.  ASICs are nothing but a step froward in chip design, just like with every other computer component. Nobody makes a 28nm gpu anymore, because it would consume outrageous amounts of power to compete with a 14nm gpu. 
any talk of switching the PoW is silly, IMO. even if it used a switching algorithm (new algo once monthly for example), a gpu farm, or a farm of servers (each with 4 cpus, 16+ ram slots, and 6+ GPUs) would be assembled that could run a a better profit margin than the guy at home who has only 1 GPU.
 Furthermore, those who have inside knowledge of the change could have the ability to pre-assemble mining systems in order to start aggressively mining at day 1 and obtain a large amount of coins in the hours or days before hobbyists and home miners join (as a counter-argument: this is the benefit of mining from the start, and required a risk of initial hardware investment)

You still talk about needing to mine though, which is my point.
Bitcoin can have zero users but still mine blocks and create a blockchain (empty other than the rewards). But if there are zero miners it's a total standstill of unconfirmed transactions.
Obviously both are important to a healthy ecosystem though

everyone has power, but bitcoin is a PROOF-OF-WORK protocol, meaning that those doing the work (SHA256 miners) are effectively the backbone of the system

i own bitcoin and i want s2x. just support a clean organised upgrade and the network wont even flinch. its not like increasing the base blocksize will suddenly mean we get 4+MB segwit blocks. sw1x is barely giving 1.1MB blocks so far and keeping the mempool at a reasonable depth. 
s2x is meant as an upgrade not for today, but for a month (or 3, or 12months) from now when theres a sudden surge of new users, or development of cool new onchain/offchain services and suddenly the 1.8-2.8Mb expected size of segwit cant cope, and fees start to rise and make these services unnappealing and people get frustrated by fees going &gt;$3 again. Thats when having a 4MB+ capacity will allow more growth and keep the fees low while sidechains and lightning develop ways of handling more and more transactions

miner centralization can happen even with a PoW - theres always a centralizing effect where power is cheap, and especially near where the hardware is first produced (cough - asia)
it may be *less* centralized than it is now, but dont think that MegaWatt GPU mining facilities wont spring up in places like washington state, china, venezuela, labrador, etc just like they did for bitcoin mining.
not to mention the sheer act of choosing/implementing a PoW could give huge advantages to those who are in the know and/or have a better algorithm than the general public. (ie: claymore or SP_, who already sell their optimized codes, or charge fees to miners)

To reach 4mb (or 8mb in s2x) with segwit means abusing the system and having rediculous signature-heavy transactions. Most realistic calculations show 1.8-2.2mb as the effective max for segwit
That said, my preference is a 2mb blocksize with a 4mb maximum cap for segwit blocks.

That's pretty understandable, but at the same time I don't believe that consensus can easily be reached on any issue in bitcoin where scaling and hardforks are involved. Particularly in an era of online partisanship.
My point of view is that there's still time to coordinate and gain better consensus towards s2x so that by the time it is ready to fork, consensus has grown to a point that it can be a smooth transition. If things are still a disaster at that point though (preferably for technical reasons rather than "___ doesn't want it so it's contentious"), then I agree we might need to back off and start talking about a better solution that can be implemented within a reasonable (&lt;6 month) timeframe with the support of core developers

no it doesnt.
but mining without the NYA/sw2x flag would idicate your lack of support and provide reason not to hardfork

@_date: 2017-09-20 02:17:21
in theory, it would mean 30-50% longer blocktimes, and a mempool that fills up as a result, meaning higher fees. if 50% left it could take up to a month for the difficulty to adjust
that said, this seems like junky fake news meant to create a bit of fud
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:33:01
No, my point was that there's a segment of users who believe that simply running a node gives them as much power as people who are actually running mining hardware.
If bitcoin was pos, holding coins in a full node WOULD give you voting benefits (and it would be mathematically proven voting, not a roundtable consensus or twitter poll)
But bitcoin is pow, and the protocol is largely determined by the miner's (obviously they need to keep users happy though so that they are mining on a network with substancial tx fees)
But to continue your discussion - yes everyone should have the ability to download, verify, and store the blockchain if they choose, but that doesn't mean that the network should pander to the weakest link. Much like p2p filesharing, the network consists of powerful nodes capable of &gt;10x seed ratios, mixed with a much larger number of leeches who have little or no bandwidth devoted to uploading

@_date: 2017-09-29 18:24:39
both subforums have their fair share of toxic posts/users, and i think its the complexity of the issue that causes people to limit their answers to mean words or name calling. The decreased moderation in r/btc im sure plays a role in enabling this i imagine.
There are technical arguments for and against both a basic blocksize increase and also segwit, but more important are the political aspects. we live in an age where reddit/facebook can be used as vectors for social engineering (ie: russia/trump/fakenews), so avoid the sensationalist junk *and pretty much any link to a twitter/medium post by someone youve never heard of*
miners profit when there are lots of onchain fee-paying transactions. Others can profit though, if bitcoin users use an 2nd layer service/ccoin of which they control or mine (Ie: eth miners benefit from those leaving BTC to ETH, or a lighning hub collecting btc-based fees from users). Much of the scaling debate is divided based on this 
right now, 94% of miners are indicating support of sw2x. ( which is mathematically demonstrated by the hashrate. I think thats something to keep in mind, that this isnt a small faction trying to fork (as was the case with Bitcoin Cash) - this is an attempt at a 95% coordination towards a smooth fork that shouldnt even need replay protection for the 5% that either intends to stay, or simply isnt flagging but will upgrade when they hear the fork occurred
tldr; if you can just sit on your hands for a day or two and not use bitcoin immediately following the hardfork, your holdings will be safe

Luke-jr said "we already have 2mb" (I assume referring to segwit), so km not sure how much I value what he says if he's still spinning segwit as a 2mb maxblocksize.
Even 12-24 months is a very long time to organise the implementation of a blocksize fork. I firmly believe that if core stood behind a 2mb code version of their own they'd see ~50% support almost immediately and 95% support/signalling in under 6 months.
(Of course they want thinblocks and schorr first though, which can take some time to implement (though xt already coded a functional xthin/thinblocks mechanism that could probably be copied to core without much difficulty?)

The article you linked basically says blockchains can't scale due to storage/bandwidth/validation requirements of a node. Segwit doesn't fix that at all. A 2mb segwit block has the exact same impact on a node as a 2mb 'legacy' block.
I like most of sehwit, but my main qualm is that witness data doesn't cost a fee, unlike the transaction info. This means that despite having the same content and size as a legacy transaction, a segwit transaction pays less to be included. Imo this isn't fair to miners who rely on fees, or to users/services that can't/don't use segwit

You can't "measure" users in any accurate way though (node counts can be manipulated, and there isn't a staking mechanism). However, 95% of the hashrate is a completely accurate depiction of miner interests and mathematically proven by their work as intended by the whitepaper.

It's been in the works as early as the honk Kong consensus that segwit would preceed a 2mb increase, which was reinforced in the core roadmap, and then brought back up as a major obstacle with the New York Agreement.
There's been major coordination by miners and many companies in the industry, but it's been actively resisted by others who either benefit by raised fees or by users leaving bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-29 17:51:29
Fair enough. I felt that it unfairly poops on the people backing sw2x and follows a prevalent dialog on r/bitcoin
If you ask r/btc, the answer is a bit different (I don't want to write a book, so I'm simplifying a bit): blocksize has been a debate for years, with some adamantly opposed to it for a multitude of reasons. More recently, segwit was brought forward as a solution that not only fixed a few various issues (tx malleability and the "jihan jihadcoin asicboost asicbleed" concerns) but also helped enable a very specific 2nd layer called lightning (which has its own fee structure, semi-centralized network hubs, and offers cheaper offchain transfers)
So the debate became between a simple size increase (which would require multiple other updates to fix malleability or asicboost), or segwit (much more complicated code, and any scaling is done with a slightly kludge method of splitting up data and charging tx fees differently).
The compromise seemed to be using segwit alongside a blocksize increase for the best of both worlds, albeit as a hardfork update. And it for a majority of miner support and many users. However, segwit activated and now we see  people who supprted sw2x originally changing their attitude and calling the 2x portion unnecessary or an 'attack', despite the fact it has clear miner support. 
I'd rather you read a variety of sources and apply critical thinking instead of taking my post (or any other post) as correct, unbiased info.
And I'd avoid getting sucked into any discussions that try to discredit people who have been in bitcoin for years and years, be it nullc/gmaxwell, jihan, lukejr, vorhees, etc. Sure some have nasty personalities or histories, but that should not immediately discredit their coding or technical analysis.
Goddam, this pretty much turned into a book and I barely scratched the surface
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:04:58
Waiting for segwit to max out before looking at an increase of maxblocksize is begging for problems. It's the exact logic that was used for the past 4 years as we approached and then faceplate hard against 1mb with massive fee increases (or long confirmation times)

Well, first everyone claimed that the miners cant create/enforce consensus. and after the Hong Kong Agreement (Jan 2016) was abandoned, the NYA was an attempt demonstrate a continued and stronger stance that 2MB+segwit is STILL desired and should be kept within pace of the original HKA
Its been a major roadmap issue for bitcoin for several years now, and the core developers have made little or zero efforts to work on a safe way to implement it (even as a simple option to flag support within your node). 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:12:51
Well it was to save face to some extent, but more so it was to demonstrate a willingness to compromise and support segwit with the intent to 2x later.
Imo things have gotten a bit out of control sadly. Best bet is to push back the 2x activation by ~3mos and keep pressuring bitcoin core to actively support 2x or at least bring forth a compelling alternative for onchain scaling. Fud around sw2x causing a nasty split is damaging whatever consensus was obtained during the past few months

@_date: 2017-10-01 16:29:08
why? because with a PROOF OF WORK system, the only truly decentralized and verifiable statistic is the hashrate.
95% supports SW2X. and if 95% move without replay protection then you should essentially consider the legacy chain dead (unless they patch in an EDA and their own replay protection, causing them to be a minority chain like BCH) and accept the fact that block have more space, that isnt even being used yet.
segwit has so far led to many blocks just slightly larger than 1MB. The activition of sw2x doesnt mean we suddenyl get 2Mb blocks. itll still only be 1-&gt;1.15MB/block for the next few months probably
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:57:52

@_date: 2017-10-05 21:55:19
they did. they made a simple fork with limited modifications from it, to give users the most effective way to accept 2mb blocks while benefitting from the work done in the core repository.
thats the whole point of open source code.

we've seen it happen for years now though - look at how much money early altcoin investors have made (not counting the PnD/ flash-in-the-pan shitcoins).

@_date: 2017-09-05 20:19:47
obviously not - if its supported by the core devs, its still Bitcoin (regardless of being a contentious hardfork) /s
@_date: 2017-10-06 10:18:37
But with replay protection you get a lasting split. Without it, one chain quickly becomes in peril and should die off 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:07:08
The idea is that without replay (or with a smooth fork), the legacy chain effectively dies instantly and is replaced with the upgrade. 
In the case we do see a split I fully agree they need to hold both chains for the user. Not doing so would be an issue. 
But if s2x activates with majority hashrate and the hashrate stays there (rather than gaming a split), then the legacy chain is basically dead and coins on it should become virtually worthless while s2x continues to operate just like s1x does.
The problem is that the main arguments against it are based in this catch-22 of "it's contentious because others are calling it contentious". S2x was supposed to be a compromise that everyone could get behind and support
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:29:40

at one point S2X seemed like it had a fairly clear consensus (NYA was a compromise of blocksize and segwit, and had 95% of hashrate signalling it.
now its becoming clear that it doesnt have full consensus of users and developers, and as such people who supported it are stepping back because they see it becoming contentious.
buy AFAIC, it was a good compromise of ideals that the time and had a good chunk of backing. its a shame to see that fall apart (particularly with the active non-support by the core developers), but bitcoin was designed for this, and its demonstrating a network consensus to stay with a 1MB rule

In all fairness, Bitcoin is a SHA256-PoW blockchain. Miners are inherrently the most important part of the system and can mathematically back up thier opinion with a stake of the hashrate.
If you want your voice to be heard because you hold xxx BTC, then look at a PoS currency instead. Thats the entire purpose of them

Miners can set soft limits on blocksize (remember a year or two ago a lot were unintentionally using the 750kb soft limit in some versions of core), or simply decide not to include low-fee transactions based on a risk/reward analysis of the fees and potential orphan rate.
Similarly, nodes can refuse to relay blocks that exceed a certain size,  come from specific miners, or have "too many" low-fee transactions. This effectively increases propogation time and thus the orphan rate. (Which then must be considered in the risk/reward analysis of miners when they choose what to include in a block)
Even with an unlimited blocksize, it's in the interest of  miners to have a minimum fee they accept and/or ensure a small amount of mempool backlog to ensure that users pay some fees.
But when the mempool has a backlog and blocks are full, the fees are determined based on blockspace, and can quickly reach 5x what a miner would have accepted were there sufficient blocksize

@_date: 2017-10-26 03:18:38
i view it as an attempt to allow consensus. if s2x gains traction with users and hashrate behind it then the exchange is willing to call that bitcoin. if not, then legacy chain stays bitcoin.
its better than S2X actually having 90%+ hashrate and a significant userbase, yet refusing to acknowledge it.
IMO: everyone give it a week with the BTC/S2X naming then reevaluate. at this point any semblence of consensus seems to have fallen apart so its likely after a few days we will see that the legacy chain is still dominant.
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:36:54

If you want to change the pow to either an asic proof algorithm or POS, doing it in any sort of rush would cause massive impacts to the network
It's one thing to phase it out over a long time frame that allows miners to plan for it, and another to change it with a knee-jerk hardfork because bitmain and the people who are mining with antminer equipment are successful in a capitalistic market.
Ethereum is leading the way on a pow-&gt;pos transition, and will set a template of how such a change can be implemented without too much disruption to miners. Environmentally and politically, POS might be a better option longterm as it uses far less electricity and gives people a 'vote' based on holdings rather than hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:15:24
I like the idea of it implementing at a set height, but unless the core software developers back it then we may never see it gain sufficient traction with users.
People talked about setting a blockheight for it several times in the past few years, and it was placed in the core roadmap, but a firm date/blockheight has never been supported by core
@_date: 2017-10-05 00:17:27
because his idea of a definition is actually just a thesaurus suggestion
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:49:58
So you think 95% of *users* supported segwit, based on what metric? 
Sure miners benefit from a mempool backlog resulting in high fees (and some also stand to benefit through asicboost), but that logic stands somewhat at odds with their support of s2x which promises even lower onchain fees.
There are a few small factions that would fight a blocksize increase for non technical reasons, such as to lead users offchain, increase tx fees, or as an attempt to degrade the bitcoin community in order to boost competing currencies like ltc/xmr/eth/etc
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:33:52
Because silly technical arguments against it, many of which apply equally to &gt;1mb segwit blocks.
There are big factions in the community that seem to refuse cooperation or compromise on scaling and technical issues. I (and many others) thought that sw2x was a fair compromise that increased blocksize and enacted segregated witnesses. 
In the face of the current contention I've personally backed down on my support for a November hardfork, but still believe sw2x needs to be supported by core and implemented safely on a less controversial timeframe.
If we don't see a proposal that activates &gt;2mb maxblocksize by the end of 2018, I firmly believe that's a massive problem and will fracture the community further. This will likely send more people to litecoin (sw1x blocks every 2.5min is 4x the capacity) or bitcoin cash if fees and confirmation time don't improve and stay reasonable

I remember about a year or two ago when some miners were running versions of core that had a soft limit of 750kb, despite a mempool backlog.
That's basically what I'm talking about by letting miners choose a soft limit while the hard limit provides ample space in case of a loss in hashrate or periodic influx of transactions (such as on black friday or in the case of a lot of users moving coins to/from exchanges during a price movement)

Asicminer would've followed segwit even if uasf was how it was enabled 
Sw2x was an attempt to find a consensus based on a compromise by combining both segwit and blocksize into a single agreement. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:14:37
You're right, the 2015 roadmap only alludes to working on a reasonable and safe (it mentions the 2/4/8 idea) blocksize increase following segwit and other efforts to improve its reliability (such as thinblocks). I believe I was confusing it with the roundtable consensus where a few devs like matt, Luke and Peter agreed to a roadmap not endorsed by the entire core team.
Even so, segwit is released and thinblocks/xthin code exists (from XT devs at least), so surely this is the time for core to start vocalizing a plan for safe blocksize increase, even if it's 6mos or a year away from potential activation
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:17:05
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:34:25
S2x still has segwit though, and miner support.
It's a vocal group that vehemently oppose either hardforks, or the idea of &gt;1mb as the maxblocksize despite the fact segwit already enables &gt;1mb effective size (and thus a null point, meaning the opposition is almost entirely just the idea of a hardfork upgrade)
If there wasn't so much FUD, and users were simply encouraged to use a client that would consider s2x valid, then the upgrade would be a non-issue with maybe a few hours of 'downtime' where it's recommended to hold of sending any transactions to ensure the risk of reorganization is gone

Meanwhile, bitfury operates privately, manufacturing and selling only to investors with $100k+ to buy freight container mining farms.

Jihan has as much claim to bitcoin as almost any other major individual in the cryptosphere. He developed one of the first asics (It was a close tie between bitmain, avalon, ashicminer, and bitfury), optimized it to be the best of the bunch, sold it globally, and accounts for a big portion of the hashrate. Antminers probably account for 80% of the entire sha256 hashrate globally.
That said, I don't think he's doing any sort of takeover. Bitcoin was built so that riles can be modified via hard/soft forks in the code, and the protocol is open for use by multiple clients (armoury, mycellium, btc1, etc all comply with the rules and function fully on the network)
I'm not a lawyer and don't deal a lot in opensource code, but my understanding of the mit license is that anyone can use and copy your code. There are opensource licenses that are far more restrictive, but MIT simply isn't one of them. It's only condition is that the license terms need to be attached to any copies made.
Anyone can copy the core repository and modify the rules to create a custom client. That's the whole point, and if you think that will cause bitcoin to implode then it's not the currency for you. 
The idea that core developers or blockstream own bitcoin is far far worse then the concept of others using the opensource repositories as intended
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:17:38
My holdings are precious to me, so id sooner risk holding through a successful fork then trading 1:1 ahead of what may become a split.
For example, I've picked up about a dozen BCH coins in the $350-550 price range (atop the ones I received in the split) because I think all this bitcoin infighting may strengthen that chain. But I bought a few days after the split once the price had achieved some semblance of stability
Personally I think the whole thing is silly. The group that wanted segwit got s1x and the group that adamantly refused it got bch. But there isn't much reason why the segwit group shouldn't want to expand the blocksize as well, and most of the arguments against it don't have much basis.
More burden on nodes? S1x blocks already mean nodes have to handle &gt;1mb, and s2x won't magically result in 2mb blocks overnight.
It allows jihancoin/asicboost: segwit fixed that in s1x, and will continue to with s2x
The devs don't support it: mostly for the reasons anove/below, which are negated by simply cooperating on a smooth hardfork release
Contentious fork w/ no replay? It wouldn't be contentious if people were not actively fighting it for the reasons above
S2x was meant to be a compromise between onchain scaling and the implementation of segwit for better offchain scaling

Yeah but we're unlikely to reach that. Even with thorough adoption of segwit most people expect 2-2.5mb as the maximum weight possible. Reaching 4mb basically means having a singular transaction that would take a ton of time to validate. And it still forces the majority of growth to be done with segwit.
My preference is for 2mb maxblocksize with a maximum segwit weight of 4mb, and looking to increase it to either 2/8 or 4/8 by 2019

It had 95% miner support - that's why segwit is now active. The thing is a lot of miners and groups backed sw2x but didn't have any intention to continue supporting the 2x portion after segwit activated.
It went from only mildly contentious to what it is now because the snowball effect of people backing out and withdrawing support. 
As for the core development team, they have adamantly refused to be involved in the development of a 'safe' hardfork. If they would simply get on board with a reasonable blocksize proposal then I expect that proposal would gain traction and reach a strong level of real consensus. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:18:16
in theory, transaction on either chains will almost certainly be replayed on the other, so if tyhe exchange sent you an sw2x coin, a greedy miner would rebroadcast it automattically for the sw1x fees, and you would receive the sw1x coin as well. (thats my understanding at least)
as for the courts, the simplest definition of bitcoin would probably be the longest, most difficult SHA256 blockchain
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:18:41
jesus, just follow the miners to the new chain (95% flagging of the hashrate right now), and you wont have any replay risk, and segwit will still do everything it does today

It's also extremely biased.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:22:36
What about simply using the replay capabilities of the network? If they send you a sw2x coin as withdrawal, then broadcast on the sw1x network and get those coins as well.
In theory, wouldn't greedy miners automatically try to broadcast all transactions on the one chain onto the other,   giving them the fees from both? 
In that case, wouldnt it be impossible to seperate the sw1x and sw2x coins, as they would essentially be mined on both networks simultaneously? The only limit would be blocksize, where it would create a fee backlog on sw1x network

i dont want to get sucked into any silly conspiracies, but it still feels like the core development team has no immediate (2017 or 2018) plans to support an implementation of increased blocksize, and have actively fought against the efforts of others to increase it (calling them "hostile attacks", throwing personal insults, and/or questioning the credibility/capability of "altcoin" developers)
I thought that SW2X was supposed to be a fair compromise of ideals, and i think the majority of miners signing it also felt so. In the ensuing mudslinging, its become clear that it doesnt have support from he "segwit only" crowd (many of which expect blocksize to be an issue for 2019-2020 i think), and the picture of consensus and compromise has fallen apart.
at this point i assume only a minority of miners will still be working on S2X blocks within 48hrs of the hardfork, and that the lack of replay will (hopefully) cause the minority splitchain to die off quickly with everyone returning to BTC
But i think that the Core team needs to put down some solid timeframes and objectives for scaling onchain. segwit gives a roundabout way of increasing space, and more importantly enables LN networks, but leaving the maxblocksize at 1MB for too long is foolhardy and will continue to result in other development teams arrising who want to push their own hardfork increase since core/blockstream wont.

so what do you call it if someone uses a trezor to send and receive bitcoins, and uses it daily? 
running miner hardware makes you a miner. They inherently use bitcoin by deciding what address the mined coins go to.

They are not malicious, they are intending to fork an upgrade, if you were to drop your bias and assume their bias.
From their point of view, core 0.15 is actively promoting censorship and blacklisting of bitcoin nodes. 
If the issue is banning them prior to the fork so that nodes still keep a valid peerlist, then the ban should be et to enable a few blocks ahead of the fork, not over a month in advance

Fair to miners might not have been the right phrase persay. My issue is that it creates two seperate types of transaction fee despite the transactions being virtually identical (storage, bandwidth and validation requirements are identical between a segwit tx and a legacy tx)
Imo signature data should count towards fee calculation

miners have incentive to make bitcoin valuable and profit from mining it. In theory they will want to technologically advance it to compete with other currencies.
and bitcoin is SHA256-PoWORK. if anyone gets to choose what Bitcoin is, its the ones doing SHA256 mining. Thats pretty much the abstract of the whitepaper

I try to listen to advice on all sides, and apply a grain of salt to everything I read, including factoring in potential bias of developers and investors (on both sides).
Is it fair to say that the bitcoin core wants to scale through the lightning network (requiring quasi-decentralised "hub nodes" that have lots of bandwidth and storage, while users can run full nodes that do not require powerful computers), while classic/xt/ec/sw2x wants to scale through onchain (requiring more powerful nodes with increased bandwidth and storage capabilities)?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:10:30
Calling it a hijacking is being a bit facetious.  It was *intended* to be a well-supported part of the segwit2x/nya agreement that miners signalled in order to enable segwit (step 1 of the 2 step plan of reaching sw2x)
Unfortunately, a lot of the original sw2x supporters only wanted segwit and quickly began backtracking after segwit locked in. In doing so, sw2x went fr o m having a *reasonable semblence* of consensus to a diminishing support group, which is a bit of a catch-22 as it became more contentious, more people withdrew support.
I fully supported sw2x, but with the fact that a significant part of the ecosystem has drifted away or pulled support from it, it has obviously become contentious. Imo people on both sides are playing dumb politics by refusing to cooperate on a path that has full consensus, and in the process sw2x is unlikely to succeed with enough support. As much as I wanted it to succeed, I now feel we need to ditch the 2x for now and revisit the drawing board.
But a blocksize increase is still required in the short-medium term - hopefully we see either 2mb or 4mb (with a 2x boost via segwit) by the end of 2018
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:01:47
Jihan is mining on the bitcoin chain still. And yes I do hold more bch than I do btc because I expect there's a chance s2x will fail and a lot more users and miners will spill over to bcash if the fees are lower
People run core for the same reason they run Windows - it's the biggest, best supported, most popular client. (And I don't blame them, the core devs do a ton of good work even though scaling blocksize isn't a priority to them). But just because 90% of computer users run Windows doesn't mean that they all support the new "payperyear" features of windows or want their system to track and share their personal information with microsoft by default.
If users have the say, then core and other clients should allow users to easily indicate technical preferences (such as whether a &gt;1mb block is valid, or opting in/out of RBF). It's not an endall solution but would give a bit of clarity regarding user preferences

I think a year is a bit long, but 6+ months would be ideal to ensure adequate time for the entire network to get updated to compatible versions.
The main problem is core, which seems to have no real desire to take a hard stance on when/how to implement a blocksize increase. The core roadmap from almost two years ago indicated a 2mb fork would be available by now, so it's clear that wasn't a firm plan and not seriously followed through on. (At least hka/nya signers have been working hard to try and follow through).  
If core would set a 4mb hardfork date at 1yr from now, and start baking it into the software, myself and others would probably move support from s2x to that s4x plan, assuming we don't see them pull a 180 in 6 months and claim it's a dangerous/unneccessary/contentious fork that they can no longer support
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:41:22

@_date: 2017-09-28 18:49:18
That's fair, but if that's the case that the hashrate follows sw2x then sw1x would need to patch in an EDA or pow change very quickly.
In the current situation where support is wavering, replay protection seems like something that can and should be added

@_date: 2017-10-31 18:15:17
The counter to that is that a maxblocksize increase was blocked for years by developers of segwit.
The reality is that there was a stalemate between two different methods of scaling, and users were suffering fees and block times as a result.
Uasf crowd wanted to force segwit. Classic/xt/bu crowd wanted to implement blocksize increase. S2X wanted to be a compromise. BCH decided not to compromise and forked off with an onchain scaling model.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:30:58
I agree about the ability to clean up segwit in a hardfork, but not about needing segwit data from the main network.
A segwit testnet existed for months before it was activated by sw2x signalling. Plenty of opportunity to replicate real world situations by creating transactions in the testnet.
Segwit does help a lot with scaling,  but there is a ceiling to the benefits it can provide (even paired with LN) because of the maxblocksize. It's debatable whether it will take 6months or 5 years to reach that point
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:40:43
It's not a takeover, it's an attempt to enable a consensus change since the bitcoin core software does not give that ability. 
Any forked changes could be copied into bitcoin core and core could still act as leaders of an s2x chain, but they are steadfast in maintaining a 1mb limit

If i convince someone to buy bitcoin in canada - they have very few options:

2) spend 4-10 business days crating an exchange account, its verification process, and transferring money there from a bank
3) use a bitcoin ATM (theres a few around the toronto region, but they charge a 10-15% premium over using an exchange (or about 5-10% more than using localBTC)

So then core should support it and make a "better" version of the core client that's compatible for people to use.
I'm not a fan of the fact that core can't actually release a compatible version with an opt in/out toggle so the user can decide whether they would support the fork. Releasing only a version that blacklists part of the network (without even having an opt in/out option for that) is the exact opposite
2mb has been in the core road map for a long time, but it seems they only put it there as a bargaining chip for segwit, rather than something they have any intention to code/support
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:02:34
A lot of people were calling segwit overly complex for a long time, and it's competition included bitcoin classic, xt, and EC as onchain solutions.
A big issue to some was that segwit fees are disproportionate because the witness data doesn't cost a fee yet requires just as much burden on nodes and miners to store and validate as it would if it was a regular onchain transaction. (Tbh that was/is my biggest gripe with segwit, I think witness data should be considered in fee calculations because it otherwise forces people to use it unneccessarily, just for the sake of lower fees)
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:19:52


often these "isolated incidents" tend to form a pattern, and even if its something as simple as "running ____ in the background will cause a sync failure", it helps to then dig out a root cause.
ie: look at the destiny2 banning issue. bungie initially claimed it wasnt an issue, then came back to specify that yes it was, and generally caused by overlays and hardware monitoring software in the background. It took 24hrs for enough people to report the issue that they took it seriously, investigated, and found a root cause
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:26:44
So now what? We hold blocksize hostage until segwit is full and the mempool grows and fees rise again?

Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. Maybe you avoid tying an identity to an address, buy unless you use a mixer then a lot of information can still be deciphered from your transactions and change addresses.
LN means even less data is recorded to the public blockchain (though hubs may still be able to record it and dispense the data to authorities on request?)

Uh huh, because obviously while segwit was waiting to activate the developers were completely unable to work on other code

^this. I think with all the illegal or deceptive practices used in his investigation/arrest, he could stand a very good chance of early release, but its unlikley he will hold an appeal for another year or two so that:
1) additional evidence can come to light, particularly if the DEA was being dishonest
2) if there is a link between SR and MTGOX, waiting for it to come to light - particularly if others were involved in the DPR account
3) he can argue hes served 24-30 months by that point, and has made all possible efforts to rehabilitate. 
Therefore, early probation might be put on the table. thats about the best he can hope for. This news of DEA agents stealing criminal assets unfortunately does little to prove Ulbrich innocent - it just provides some doubt that could allow for an earlier release date via appeal

proof-of-work inherently centralises. even with gpu mining theres people with entire offices/garages/warehouses of rigs with hundreds of GPUs running on a single IP.
ASICs obviously dont help, particularly because of the improvement from 55nm-&gt;16nm that took only ~3yrs. however, its unlikely we will see &lt;10nm for quite a while still, so *ideally* the market will eventually saturate with current-gen hardware so anyone can easily buy 16nm used miners for home mining.
regardless, PoW will always centralise to people who have cheap electricity and can benefit from economy of scale. Look at GreatNorthData - they are working on a 10MW facility in Canada for mining because they are located near a hydroelectric dam and get oodles of cheap power

stress test: not the fault of a miner.
miners including those: how mining works. the transaction fees were good. The miners included the spam because the payout to them was worth it (plus it helps carry through the stress test better to see what actually happens during a series of full blocks)
during a stresstest there is financial incentive for the miner through fees. If the miner was crafting themselvs a large block though, they would miss out on the fees (That can make up 1-2% of the block reward now, and possibly 4-5% after halving = 0.2-0.3BTC/block)
the orphan risks of creating a 1TB block is roughly equal to 1000x the transaction fees of a current block. thats roughly 200+ BTC/block in terms of "risk".  even if thats not the case, and its only 10x the "risk", 2BTC is a significant cost based on a 12.5BTC reward. how many will orphan before you can successfully make a 2-3 block "longest chain"?

You're only half-right. In a PoStake blockchain you voice your say proportionally to the coins you control. In a PoWork blockchain (ie: bitcoin), you voice your say proportionally to your hashrate.

I'm not sure if you misinterpreted the comment - vorhees was referring to the 12/2015 core 'roadmap' which outlined a rough sequence of upgrades (segwit, xthin, schorr, and eventually blocksize), signed exclusively by a dominant group of core developers.
He WAS NOT referring to the hka/roundtable which is different.
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:47:04
But it still demonstrates that a modest change to maxblocksize has been an ongoing issue for years, but as a group the core developers refuse to work on a safe release, and call the releases made by others attacks or altcoins. 
Why can't we just have all sides work on a safe and consensus-gaining method of blocksize increase. Segwit can't scale infinitely and offchain/sidechain scaling hits a ceiling if you can't properly settle to bitcoin's blockchain. 
At this rate we could see another 4yrs of infighting, namecalling, and labelling non-core software changes as attacks

Noone wants bitcoin to have continuous splits, but it's not uncommon for a 1-2 block chainsplit that results in a reorganization (I'm mobile so can't really look up atatistics, but I'm sure that's 2+block reorgs/orphans occur semi-frequently, though it's likely your transaction will get picked up by a miner on the non-orphan side)
Having a hard lit on blocksize can cause the mempool to become backlogged and result in rapidly rising fees for validation (and a hardfork upgrade obviously takes a very long time to gain consensus for), similarly to what was seen in the last 6months preceeding segwit.
I support the idea that nodes can choose to enforce soft limits by refusing to propogate blocks&gt;x.xMB or any transactions with fees &lt;x.x sat/kb. In doing so miners of large blocks or low-fee transactions have an increased orphan risk. Likewise, miners can enforce soft limits on the size of block they mine/relay. It would result in a more fluid and dynamic fee market where miners need to weigh the risk/reward of making excessively large blocks.

In comparison a new coin starts with little value and initial buyers/miners quickly own a significant % of the currency, before it takes several years to redistribute to new users. A few years ago a lot of bitcoiner had 1000+ coins because it only meant a few $100k.

Devs agreed following the hong Kong consensus that 2mb would be part of their roadmap.
Users benefit from lower fees resulting from blocks having adequate space.
Businesses benefit from building services that require onchain transactions (and can use segwit to help with that, or with offchain solutions as well)
Most of it comes down to the catch-22 of "___ called it contentious, so thus it doesn't have full support and I myself must consider it contentious and cannot support it". If consensus is the goal then we need all sides involved to work towards a unified goal (which segwit + 2mb was supposed to be)
@_date: 2017-10-04 18:25:13
I'm not sure if that's the same as the idea of a fee discount (I might need to read up on other articles).
My understanding was that segwit transactions split the signatures from the rest of the transaction data, which for most transactions means 50-75% of the data is signatures (hence the anticipated 2.5-4mb effective size). But more importantly, fee calculations are only based on the "transaction info", while the signature data has no associated fee.
As such, a segwit transaction requires just as much (slightly more even) space to store on a node, but carries a greatly reduced fee compared to a traditional transaction. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:12:53

The problem is that we might not need more blocksize today or next month, but within a year I expect segwit blocks to be &gt;2mb and reaching the limits of segwit capabilities to sit within the arbitrary 1mb maxblocksize.
And if we wait until then to work on a solution, it will take tons of squabbling about 2mb being an too little, 4mb being dangerous, and a lack of consensus.
If it isn't s2x next month, then what/when will we have a solution that is technically feasible and has consensus? I forsee people blaming the miner's for fighting consensus in order to force a backlog-based fee market all over again

I still see it as relatively low-risk as the attacker would very quickly loose credibility, driving away pool users (if it was a pool) and/or investors (if its a mining company that relies on VC), as well as possibly getting filtered by other pools.
like i said, most pools would conceivably set limits to how large a block they would bother to download and verify, such as at 10x the average blocksize.
tldr; we could see 10MB blocks of spam, primarily from loadtest attacks, but it is extremely unlikely that a miner would be behind it, and would have little to gain if they tried producing unreasonably large (&gt;50MB) blocks

Not true. Decentralization can be achieved with as little as 3 seperate entities, but becomes MORE secure with a larger number of nodes.
So long as nodes are not ALL operated by a single entity, the system is technically decentralised. 6000 nodes run by home users is not really any different from 6000 nodes run by data centers, corporations, and miners - so long as they each serve thier own independent purposes (and not a cartel)

sidechains are not ready for use yet, but bitcoin is already in place, and completely functional even when blocks are full (1MB) during stresstesting.
what we DO see however, is that 1MB is a hard limit and when blocks start being filled transaction fees skyrocket and low-fee transactions are ignored. It should be painfully obvious that doubling or quadrupling the blocksize is not a threat and that if it takes 3-6mos to gain supermajority here should be a sense of urgency in deploying a version with large-blocks code.
you'll never get a consensus if there is not a choice. even now the XT software is 10% of nodes and ~0.3% of mining despite all the resistance to it. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 10:41:15
Antpool is missing from that (and is about a 24% share), as are several others. Though its possible that this graph does not associate addresses with the company/entity mining to them 
Biggest concern now is antpool. IMO, no pool should control &gt;15% (ideally 10% or less) and people mining there should consider other options such as slush (6% mining.bitcoin.cz) or eligius.st (4%)

2mb is just not enough. We need 4MB+ sooner than later (i personally agree with BIP101)
More to the point, what will go wrong at 2MB? Is the network so overwhelmingly fragile that it can't handle doubling the *MAX* block size limit? Besides some stress testing or deployment of new use cases, we wouldn't see many blocks &gt;1mb for a few months. Blocks &gt;1mb should be seen as growth and a positive thing anyways.
We started the discussion at 20mb almost a year ago. Since then, it seems like the debate has turned into 1mb vs 2mb

Everyone already knows not to trust zero-conf and generally 3-6 confirmations is the accepted minimum before considering a transaction 'irreversible'
That doesn't change in the case of a s1x/s2x split, other than to perhaps consider 5-10 confirmations as irreversible until the dominant chain becomes obvious
@_date: 2015-09-29 14:08:36
The fact that bitcoin value has remained stagnant (typically means that user base is also stagnant or growing slowly) and blocks are 70% full on average.
If we saw a period of growth (an app, a price rise, etc) blocks would become full very quickly. Even 2mb blocks would fill up if the number of bitcoin users (or even just frequency of transactions) doubled 
Bitcoin is not at its peak. If you beleive bitcoin could be used by 2x as many people then you should understand that block size needs to be ~4x the current capacity at minimum (more users = exponentially more transactions)

Oh yeah, because a 2ghz dual-core computer with 4gb of ram and a 1TB hard drive costs "thousands of dollars".
You can get all that for &lt;$400 (possibly ~$250) and be capable of handling at least a few years of bip101 before you need to invest $100-200 in upgraded ram and hdd.
Hell, you can buy a pre-assembled 250gb node for $160, or a 120gb node with a screen for slightly more. Both will handle at least 2yrs of bip101 I expect

I'm not the most technical person I admit, but I've been mining and holding coins since the gpu/fpga days of 2013, and several  first gen antminer/bitfury units. I like to think that provides some insight into the network as I've watched it almost daily for 4+yrs

@_date: 2017-10-03 14:43:50
I tried to discuss, I'm honestly confused at this point why people are against properly coordinating a path for onchain scaling when it's been an obvious issue snce as early as 2013, and was even a key part of the core road map at one point
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:18:54
Segwit was contentious and core was happy to implement it. Even though it was a softfork, it's essentially a forced upgrade.
I'm simply suggesting even a method for nodes to flag/signal their support the way miners do. I'm sure a lot of people want to run core since it's the most advanced client, but still support having &gt;1mb blocks
And if you want to protect against an uncoordinated split, the clients could implement the ban/nlacklisting just a few blocks before the KNOWN hardfork height, rather than more than a month in advance, serving only to fracture a network where the btc clients are still 100% in consensus on the protocol rules

So? Run a pruning node and let the big boys handle storage of spam/'irrelevant'/old blocks
@_date: 2015-09-02 01:37:58
because the majority of the system is backed by miners (in a hardware cost type of way), and the stability and security of bitcoin+its value is controlled by the mining process and distribution.
centralised mining is really just the result of someone who has invested thousands or millions of dollars in producing an obscure, volatile currency. It goes to state that this person therefore has a significant say and some control over mining fees.
but history shows that with basic filters in place (such as 0.0001BTC minimum fee), theres very little risk of blocks being completely filled when no miners have really bothered with that type of attack thus far
that said, fixed growth rate of blocksize cap that provides significant headroom should be implemented. I prefer BIP101 but would prefer a version that started at only 4MB

my view on it is that this device is overpriced, but that there could be serious potential in both:
The 21.co ASIC - if it can achieve 0.16w/GH that is a serious accomplishment, and some people might buy this just to examine the ASIC/PCB design.
The OS - I think theres a good chance this could be the real gold here. if it works easily and capably, it could be the basis of an improved digital market or IoT
tldr: this hints at thier mining capability, demonstrates serious work towards thier distributed mining goal, and *could* be game-changing for the IoT.
this is a conceptual design. You need to picture what happens when you strip it down to just an OS (&lt;2GB, $5) and a mining chip ($20-50) that can be built into a range of IoT objects (appliances, cable boxes, cars/tolls)

Do you think when you run bittorent that your files are downloaded from home users with &lt;30kBps upload? It's served primarily by dedicated servers that can serve you 300kBps or better normally. 90% of your download speed comes from 10% of your connected peers

Completely reasonable and well-described method of how a good github works.
But the key takeaway might be this:
 "Where a patch set proposes to change the Bitcoin consensus, it must have been discussed extensively on the mailing list and IRC, be accompanied by a widely discussed BIP and have a generally widely perceived technical consensus of being a worthwhile change based on the judgement of the maintainers."
tldr: inference to the blocksize debate is that the risks outweigh the benefits until proven otherwise, at least in Bitcoin Core

I'm not quite that much of a gambler, so the safe path is to just hodl and have coins on both chains in the event the fork isn't a clean upgrade and instead results jn a split.
But I would probably exchange a 10-20% portion of my s1x coins into the s2x chain anyways since I believe it's a better route. All the benefits of segwit plus all the benefits of increasing the maxblocksize.
The only risks are from those who are fighting the upgrade and refuse to update their clients/nodes to be view and &gt;1mb blocks as valid. Most of the technical arguments against a blocksize increase relate to the fork bejng contentious, rather than the fact that segwit blocks are already &gt;1mb and it's not like sw2x means we will suddenly have every block being 2+MB immediately after the fork. It'll still be a slow but continuous growth in both blocksize and the utilization of segwit addresses/txs
@_date: 2015-09-29 10:49:17
LN could work great, but the fact is that it isnt ready yet and even when it is the main blockchain still needs to handle more than 100kb/minute (litecoin handles 1MB/minute)
2mb is barely even a step forward, which is why I say 4MB is a bare minimum change. BIP101 is the ideal IMO (though perhaps reduced to a 25%/yr growthrate after the initial 8MB)
@_date: 2015-09-28 11:06:37

If enough people *simultaneously* start mining blocks that do not meet the current consensus rules, but share a *new* consensus rule set, they would produce the longest chain [and be identified as Bitcoin]
Regarding the secondary issue of whether forked chains (successful, failed, orphaned and/or accidental) - it would still be considered mining bitcoin, albeit a non-conforming fork that isn't (and never will be) the longest chain. If the chain made any significant progress (such as having 20% of the hashrate) it may need to be given an alternative name like the ETH/ETC split was.
But I don't support a disorganised fork. I beleive changes (such as both on and of chain scaling) need to receive supermajority support and have a pre-determined "activation period" so that the entire network is upgraded and capable of the change prior to the first blocks using the new rules. (that's how some significant code changes have been done in the past)

Obviously they will b banned if there is a fork in the network, because blocks will be invalid as you said.
But banning them ahead of time (in this case, well over a month ahead of the planned fork) serves no purpose except to politicize the issue and further the debate over censorship of the blockchain.
There is some benefit to banning them before the forked block, but you could easily set the ban to enable at blockheight = sw2x fork height - *10* (assuming that 100 minutes is sufficient to build a compatible peer list). Banning them now will just lead to the name spoofing that is already started
@_date: 2016-10-22 14:23:13
that's not correct. It doesn't encourage miners to mine any size they won't, excuse the blocks mined would not match consensus and it would be a silly individual fork that has no chance. 
Instead they "flag" thier 1mb blocks with a desired size (such as 2b or 4mb or 100GB) that acts as a sort of "vote". If a majority vote &gt;1mb then the smallest vote with 95% support becomes the new blocksize consensus.
A lot of miners have been using flags like 2mb or 8mb for months now, doesn't mean they have forked away from the chain

They may even change thier mind if they review the segwit code and agree that it presents benefits and has an acceptably small risk.
People need to be willing to learn and change thier opinions. Segwit offers some benefits to bitcoin, but isn't really much of a blocksize solution by itself. Segwit+BU are both modifications that can help bring bitcoin mainstream during the next 5-10 years and handle 100-10,000x the current transaction volume

The point is rolling out a solution can take months or more, especially if you want 90% consensus. And then you assume that in the next 4 years, bitcoin will *at most* quadruple in transaction volume.
LN isn't ready yet, and likely won't take more than 10-20% of transaction volume for a few months after the alpha/beta testing starts.
Bitcoin is not supposed to be limited so that side chains are a necessity. Side chains are their own centralized networks that ride atop the bitcoin protocol. Centralized being the key word.
@_date: 2015-09-28 17:53:52
It's the same bad logic 
You keep returning to the concept that limiting the block size will make bitcoin some sort of 'digital gold' without understanding that the analogy runs flat when we run out of block space. 
When 1mb blocks are full, bitcoin will stop being a digital commodity because a vast number of transactions are routinely ignored due to low fee, and you could see $10/tranaction fees (which is not at all competitive with central banking)
Block size needs to grow, regardless of why

I'm on mobile (sad excuse I know), but if you go and look at when the 1mb limit was made in 2009, you can look at the blockchain for that time period. 
Until 2010-2011 there was not much transaction volume, never remotely close to 1mb. The limit was similar to you deciding to limit your router to 1000 peer connections even though 10-50 is most common, just so that it can block ddos attacks but won't interfere with your own usage (even if you ran an abnormal amount of p2p connections now and then)

And nothing happened with classic either.
I don't understand all the hate about simply initiating a vote on blocksize, if the default outcome is no change to the current consensus code. There was a huge amount of negative opinions that classic (or BU) would suddenly split the network when it had nowhere near the activation threshold 
And if it did reach activation, it would demonstrate a majority shift in opinion (by miners and/or pool operators) by either a 3:1 or 19:1 ratio. 
I beleive that 75% is a bit too low, and that 95% is too stringent as it allows minority players to hold back decisions. Realistically 85% (5:1) or 90% (9:1) is a better compromise for an opinionated issue like blocksize. If 85% of the [mining] network actively votes xxMB then it should be considered a strong consensus (despite a 10-15% minority in opposition).

If you assume that bottleneck ing the network will make it into a settlement layer, it's because you completely disregard it's ability as a payments network, and if the payments start using another network (like monero or LTC) the billions of dollars held in bitcoin will move over and leave bitcoin as an empty, rarely-used shell.
Do you settle your bank balances with a gold transfer? What about if you buy a car/home? Do you convert your everyday currency (usd) into a settlement currency (like gold bullion, or maybe Swiss francs) and use that for your large purchase?
Bitcoin can and will handle everything. High-speed payments will likely occur in side chains, but the blockchain will be capable of any sort of transaction as long as it is not limited by an arbitrary maxblocksize

have we ever seen a spamming miner? Its a risk on their part and the chances of orphaning their block outweigh the benefits. 
and by benefits, i mean the fact you would tarnish yourself, and possibly devalue the bitcoins you try to earn by pumping out big blocks that others take time to validate
I don't beleive this is a concern. if other miners decided "hey, lets ignore blocks &gt;10x the average blocksize (such as a &gt;10MB block today)", then that large block would quickly become the shorter chain, regardless of whether nodes ignore it or not.
@_date: 2016-10-22 14:35:09
Sure, BU might allow miners to create immediate forks but obviously that is a total waste of mining power unless a majority of the network does so. It's just a fast way to an unrecognized block and waste of hashes. 
The correct usage is "I will mine and accept 1mb blocks until a network majority indicates they want an increase" combined with "each block I mine within the 1MB consensus will have a flag indicating my preference for blocks up to --MB in size"
I don't support forking with minority of hashrate. It's silly and won't achieve anything besides a chain of a few blocks long that the network will never recognise or participate in. The purpose of BU is to enable a way of indicating a preference for how to change the consensus, and recognising the preferences indicated by other miners. If a majority (i believe 950/1000 blocks) indicate desire for change, that is the trigger and BU users will start to mine and accept blocks up to the size that 95% could agree on. (I think there is also some activation period so that the size changes are predictable)
Imo it's much better than waiting for the btc/core developers to decide on and implement a specific, centralized size change in thier code. This is a system that can allow size increases to occur based on continously feedback of miners
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:23:59
Explain how? The only way fees stay stagnant is if transaction volume is stagnant. Even then, as the block reward decreases, miners will be forced out and hashrate will dwindle.
-unless... usd/btc increases to offset the loss of subsidy. But this would mean fees reduce (in btc) to retain a stagnant $ cost, which requires an increase in bitcoin value or decrease in hashrate. All without an increase in transaction volume

@_date: 2016-10-18 14:49:32
That's not how it works. BU miners flag a desired size, but continue to mine the consensus until at least XX% (95% iirc for BU) of mined blocks have flags greater than 1mb, at which point the consensus value shifts to the lowest flag value with 95% support.
So if 20% of miners voted 8MB, 20% voted 1GB, and at least 55% voted any other values &gt;2MB.... consensus would shift to a 2mb blockchain.
It allows much more fluid size increases long term
@_date: 2015-11-07 04:35:32
I disagree.
1) BIP101 is not at the far end of the spectrum. the first considerations for blocksize were an increase to 20MB. If anything, uncapped blocksize is the "whitewash"
7/8) consider that a small number of bitcoin users currently exist, sending only a few payments now and then. What about when we have 10x as many people using bitcoin, and each one sending several times more transactions than the average user today (due to more usage scenarios)? If ~0.6MB of 'proper' transactions occur per block now, it could be 30-50MB/block within a few years. (THIS IS WHEN SIDECHAINS ACTUALLY BECOME RELEVANT, even if blocksize is set to 32MB). If you can recognize the capabilty for 40x the current volume or BTC&gt;$1000, then you see that even 32MB could fill quickly.
you must remember that bitcoin miners can set their own rules for creating a block - just because there is a 100MB limit and 10GB of spam does not mean we will see hours and hours of filled blocks. Miners can filter spam themselves, choose to only include well-paying transactions, and even set their own soft limits. Just like the current competitive nature of using cheap electricity, choosing what transactions to include will be financially-driven based on fees and the likelyhood of orphan blocks.
@_date: 2016-10-18 01:34:40
As mentioned below that includes empty (instant) blocks. Real average is more like 85-90% full. On average.
That's like saying a retail cashier only has a lineup 70% of the time because there's almost no shoppers between 7am-10am. Doesn't mean that cashier is sufficient for rush periods or heavy traffic times like Christmas or black friday.

BIP100 does not exist beyond theory. BIP101 is working code and could be integrated into Core, or an alternative client like a gitfork of Core, or running XT.
if you consider nodes that all play by the same rules, but have different soft/hardfork rules to work like 'votes', you realise having these options allows consensus. 
consensus isnt a team of 3, or 10, or even 20 core devs deciding on what will implement in the only "allowed" bitcoin client

You can't, but you should. 
Blocksize is an issue, and right now the most concrete proposal for immediate and sustained growth is BIP101. I think implementing it should be a priority of the core devs, or alternative clients with these solutions will be developed and used instead.
@_date: 2017-05-31 10:20:02
segwit will just make a brand new L2/hub-based fee system.
miners will still be mining the blockchain though, segwit, 2mb, or otherwise. mining fees are and were never a fatal flaw. them being driven up through an arbitrary and tough-to-remove cap on blocksize is the real fatal flaw.
if the original 8mb proposal had succeeded, fees would be &lt;$0.50 right now and segwit would probably have better support from miners
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:12:12
Maybe it's because after several months of heated debate, nothing has happened? We still have a 1mb limit, no working code for bip100, and negligible movement to xt/bip101
@_date: 2016-10-18 14:43:10
Lightning only scales particular types of transactions, and relies on trusted networks/hubs
Lightning offers little or no *trustless* scaling. And even if it did/does, it requires the initial/final transactions to post on the blockchain. 
So if lightning helps scale the network by 100-fold in the next few years, the initial/final transactions to blockchain will probably still exceed the 1.7mb enabled by segwit.
We need multiple combined solutions. Segwit, 2mb, lightning are all keys to a powerful blockchain.

8 years ago noone knew if bitcoin would truly succeed, let alone spawn hundreds of altcoins and a slew of L2/sidechain/token systems that are built upon bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-11-09 11:42:36

we have seen that value (sometimes an insane amount) can be given to altcoins, so this helps answer why/how the testnet coins dont become valuable themselves
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:06:57
the idea is some people want bitcoin to be a store of value settlement layer, and move the focus to L2 sidechains/lightning with its own distinct fee system
other people (miners in particular), want to ensure use of the L1 blockchain is a prominent feature of bitcoin. more transactions = more miner income. limiting blocksize forces high fee/kb rates, when having twice as many transactions with half the fee would be virtually no added hassle to miners and help map a path to a much larger maxblocksize that miners can soft-regulate
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:50:37
religion or not, increasing the block size was seen as a simple feat 6 years ago, and held off on until blocks were closer to that size (as opposed to ~3kb at the time)
segwit is nice and all, but theres no excuse for not raising the blocksize, and using "segwit is a blocksize increase" as a reason for core to offer no support for even a simple agreeable change of maxblocksize is wrong
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:53:14
because segwit=decentralization somehow?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:00:39
so a big block will cause Venezuelans to eat thier children. yuup.
a 3MB 'equivelent' segwit block has the exact same effect on FULL nodes as a 3mb blocksize would. 
not everyone need to (or will) run a full node in future, and successful decentralization means that anyone could still run one as a hobby (even if its a $400 node with $30/month broadband)
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:52:06

@_date: 2017-05-24 18:19:33
there are a bunch of ways to solve malleability. its nice that segwit can also, but its hardly a major selling point
as for decentralization, UASF in itself doesnt do anything except allow a contentious softfork without a supermajority. some might call that centralization as a small group can force softfork changes that affect the entire network - no different from bitmain refusing to produce or validate blocks &gt;500kb in order to induce a fee market.
 (segwit might help decentralise, but thats a seperate discussion from the direct impacts of UASF-ing segwit)
@_date: 2015-11-10 03:26:05
I think you ignore the economics of mining though. So long as mining is profitable, people will do it. While petahash farms and entities with &gt;10% of the network are a reasonable concern, mining will still be done by those with access to cheap power, and/or can do it at home/work where they have no labour, rent, seperate networking, to save some costs.
if bitcoin holds enough value to make mining it feasible, there will be competition to mine it, and network capabilities are of little concern to any serious miner or node operator.
also, i think the future lies in nodes having better user-defined options. such as the ability to simply not relay &lt;0.001BTC transactions, or transactions beyond a certain size. However, it WILL still accept and work fine with a blockchain with these transactions in it. If a large number of nodes refuse to relay &gt;8MB blocks, then miners will face a larger orphan risk when hashing oversized blocks

Why not? The consensus mechanism is designed to allow changes (at a 51% level). 
Bitcoin needs to scale as it becomes widespread. Segwit+lightning will enable this to great extent, but will still be limited by the underlying blockchain and the amount of data for settling the 2nd layer. 
100kB/minute is quite trivial to propagate and validate today (compared to 2009), and things like compact/thin blocks eliminate the 1mb burst of data when a solution is found
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:10:18
What if I told you that you could save $7.92 per transaction, but only if 100x as many people used the blockchain?
The argument that running a node becomes difficult, or that mining will collude, is arbitrary. In 10yrs from now you could easily store the blockchain on a $100, 20TB hard drive, and download blocks at &gt;1GBps
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:16:17
I'm assuming for places where there is no gas/fuel heating, only electrical heating. (in which case mining 1kw I'd no different than 1kw of heat from a radiator)
But if you have natural gas that's about 80% cheaper than electricity.
@_date: 2015-11-10 12:04:08
Im confused, what size of block do you think is going to happen (within 2 years)?
I can download at 1MBps. most people can. Anyone with &gt;100Terrahash will likely have &gt;4MBps. That means a mid-sized miner could download an 8MB block and verify it within about 5-10 seconds. A node could download that block within 10-15 seconds.
and also, you ignore pooled mining. nobody with less than a $50,000 investment in mining gear is going to mine directly from thier home IP. they would connect to a stratum pool server, which would handle all the heavy bandwidth at a remote, well-connected location, while the home miner only needs ~20kBps speeds to get work info.
I still empahasize that miners and nodes could choose to simply ignore and not relay solved blocks that are "too large" (such as setting a 4MB limit now, and upping that to ~12MB in a few years). It would not be a hard limit, and miners could still solve multiple blocks or have a large block successfully relayed by nodes without the filter, but would economically de-incentivize making excessively large blocks
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:53:09
That's my assumption, and as such I'm not sure if you would be able to see it reported in solved blocks (or it least it would not be counted as an XT block)
@_date: 2017-05-06 11:43:41

It's a balance of both. 90% of miners would never choose to do something that is so strongly against public interest (because of the outcome you stated, and the resulting crash in bitcoin/forkchain value), and the investment in mining hardware acts as a guarantee that they will do whatever makes the mining process more profitable (ie: stay with the users and wanting transaction fees)
On the other hand, only miners can change the consensus rules via fork. Users have no ability to do so (except for sharing thier desires with the miners). PoS coins were built to allow user-based rule changes that bitcoin never could

I personally think the coins are lost or destroyed by this point, but its hard to say.

Here's my take on it, but its hard to necessarily tell the 'intensity' of what's a line or noise:
100% vertical: single source Pubkey sends to many other wallets. could be a frequent bitcoin user, or a miner diversifying from a mining address, etc. 
100% horizontal: single destination Pubkey  receives from many bitcoin addresses. The frequency of the horizontals suggests that it is a common practice, and could belong to a vendor or miner that re-uses a receiving address frequently.
Diagonal: perhaps these somehow relate to the functions of individual bitcoin users/vendors where unique change addresses or perhaps an address generation code. (for example, maybe some of the diagonal lines are related to various paper-wallet code generating website?)

paper wallets are pretty foolproof. downloading the websites for offline use ensures that the scripts on the site do not communicate with a server (they dont anyways, this is just a precaution).
making a few paper wallets in various denominations also makes it easier to redeem them without having to make a new paper wallet for the 'change' every time.
or a trezor. its easy to use, PIN-protected, and can have multiple wallets on it simultaneously, each hidden behind a unique password. 
my stash is split: 40% casascius coins, 30% paper wallets for long-term storage, and 30% on a trezor that i use to move money to/from my hot wallets or if making a bigger purchase

A lot of the core developers are strongly opposed to a blocksize increase, so regardless of the roadmap (which is already &gt;1 month behind schedule for segwit, and puts a hardfork over a year away) I'm not totally confident btc/core will produce a blocksize hardfork.
lets assume LN/thunder work, and segwit allows them the maximum 4x capacity increase. That still means a maximum of 400kb/min (~12tps) settlement on the blockchain, where settlement transactions will likely be quite large (50kb+) and responsible for miner fees.
with the halving, miners are going to be making 12.5BTC (~$5000) less per block, which will have to be paid for by settlement transactions from lightning networks (or changes in BTCUSD or difficulty)
first, small transactions on the blockchain are priced out (currently happening). next, mid-sized transactions are priced out as settlements become popular for small transactions. finally, even settlement layers become expensive to report on the blockchain, causing settlements to happen less and less often (in order to condense data as much as possible) to the point that the blockchain barely acts as a transaction medium, and more for monthly balance reporting by secondary layers. 
bitcoin needs to grow, and that growth is exponential. without segwit/LN we would need &gt;2MB within a year, and &gt;4MB within another year. 
I think theres an aweful lot of FUD about the hard blocksize limits when miners will still have control over the soft limits to produce a fee market on an individual, decentralized basis.

what about if only GPUs with access to &lt;$0.05/kwh can make any semblence of a return? The ASIC farms will become GPU farms with hundreds or thousands of GPUs mining.
To further the risk, those GPUs can mine other coins, and the bitcoin network hashrate could be exposed to huge swings anytime some other coin is marginally more profitable.

it will, but i dont think it will be enough, particularly if we only hit a 1.3x ratio at first and ramp up to 2.0-2.5x by the end of the year.
to bring back the real use case of bitcoin, fees need to fall sub-$1 again, and the system made capable of MUCH more throughput
miners will always retain the incentive to produce their own fee market with rules (such as sat/kb) thresholds or imposing a soft blocksize limit to create fee pressure. (most miners had a 750kb soft limit still in place even when others where mining 1MB blocks and there were transaction backlogs = higher fees)

so you want to take a cheap consumer device like a $50 DVD player, and add in a $10 circuit that produces ~3cents a day while the unit is plugged in, while using about 1kWh/day of power (which is about 10-25cents for most of the world).
why would i want to buy a DVD player that bleeds money when its plugged in, costs 20% more, and is ALWAYS hot to the touch even in the summertime?
the fact is that there are datacenters all over the world that pay &lt;5cents/kwh and will be running rack-mounted systems that draw MEGAwatts of power to mine bitcoins at a slim profit margin. sticking a doofy little novelty miner in consumer electronics serves no benefit other than to create a lot of heat while losing money

segwit still needs miners though. other than defeating asicboost and giving some relief to fees, it dos nothing to decentralize bitcoin.
the people mining the segwit chain will still buy hardware from bitmain (unless they can afford a bitfury immersion-cooled shipping container for $100,000, or want to overpay for avalon equipment that is less efficient and has far less user support)
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:32:56
that was my thought process too. I started with a dozen coins at $100-200 in 2013 and bought at least a dozen more during the rise to 1000 and fall to ~$600
after that, i mostly held and mined (selling mined coins at spot or during opportune moments). 
@_date: 2016-05-31 16:14:53
my guess would be wait for halving. Without another 20%+ price rise, anyting &gt;0.5w/GH will be taken offline and a lot of people will also start trying to liquidate S7 miners.
S5 (&lt;$80, 1.1TH) may be another good option if you already have the power supplies and creating more heat/noise isnt an issue. Otherwise, try to get an S7 for &lt;$400
@_date: 2015-11-25 21:03:26
So you think that after 6 years, bitcoin has peaked?
And hashrate is directly tied to miner revenue (block reward + fees). As block reward dwindles, fees make up a lager portion. Right now fees are around 1-2% of the revenue, up to 3-4% after the halving. It's a definite factor. In 2016 (with stagnant fees/transaction volume) it will make up as much as 10% of mining revenue

There seems to be more verbal support than mining support, but a big part of that is the lack of bip101 mining pools. The ones that exist have such low hashrates that blocks are found only occasionally, and the lack of stable mining revenue drives miners back to bigger pools. (catch-22)

Uasf is bruteforce ngs a change though. I think segwit is a good idea and like seeing it's use in litecoin, but uasf isn't the way to force a fork, and opens up a bunch of vulnerabilities for non-updated nodes that can't fully validate segwit data

both types of scaling combined might get remaining miners like bitmain on board, and enable us to move to a 2+6MB or 4+4MB combined chain in another year or two

the amount in question is a big factor.
if you want to protect hundreds of bitcoins, I suggest a dedicated solution or set of solutions (encrypted paper wallets in a safe, laptop with a fresh-installed OS and bitcoin-qt, or a trezor)
but if you want to protect just a few BTC, an old laptop with a brand new windows install and used only in private networks should be sufficient protection

I dont think many people mine as purely hobby (its pretty boring, like plugging in a coffee warmer and monitoring its temperature every few days for no reason), even obby miners are oping to make a few dollars a month or even to try and make some profit.
At one point i was running a few antminer S3 units and an Sp20 at home. It was fun, and a bit of a hobby - but i also knew (*thought*) i could make a positive return on the costs.

you're saying in the case of a uasf where two seperate coins are created, and UASF is a severe minority with ~10% support, then essentially strangle the old chain to *theoretically* make uasf the official bitcoin.
that mentality and series of assumptions isnt right. IMO core needs to support a 2MB code (put in a 500kb tx size limit if quadratic scaling is your fear), either as a seperate version, or one thats combined with segwit.
segwit forces bitcoin to change radically (in many good ways), but threatens to massively shift the economics of the system (in some good ways). 2MB is entirely doable, forces little or no change to miners, users, and nodes (buy a 2TB drive, 4gb of ram, and at a 100KBps download speed and you could handle 2MB, or 4MB, for years), but obviously doesnt enable L2 solutions on its own.
I think a 2MB blocksize, with segwit enabled (make a 4MB cap for both combined), is the way to go, and would likely satisfy miners.
and at this point in this HF vs SF debate, its hard to think miners and nodes wouldnt be made aware of the need to update their clients before the fork.

in a more traditional transfer though, the inputs correlate to one or more addresses in a specific bitcoin wallet, and generally are 'owned' by the sender.
using webwallets or mixers obviously changes this, but i suspect the long-term trend will be to 100% user-controlled wallets where the 'from address'/'inputs' are the same, and the sender controls the private keys to all input addresses used.
In 10 years from now, i expect that many countries will provide/track 1-3 specific addresses per citizen complying with KYC/tax regulations, and that pub/priv keypairs will act as a sort of social insurance identification to allow for more public secured transactions with increased accountability

the core value of bitcoin is peer-to-peer electronic cash.
forcing users to L2/L3 makes bitcoin a digital gold / settlement network.
theres a fine balance where L2 makes a lot of functionality (like visa-esque payments) possible, but you cant throttle L1 in the process.
as for centralization, users still have similar demands when running nodes. segwit with a ~3MB equivelent blocksize has the same implications to node operation as a 3MB block does.

Why *doesnt* 2mb have some good reason to support it? Perhaps that 1mb was an arbitrary choice back when blocks were ~10kb, or that were basically full blocks daily at this point, or that 2mb is a small but reasonable step towards simple on-chain scaling?
Scaling won't be entirely on or off grain. It will be both. Segwit isn't meant for on-chain scaling though as its modest ~70% increase could take much of a year to achieve if users are slow to upgrade or begin using segwit wallet addresses. Bitcoin will have massive data throughout one day (if you beleive it's usage for tokens/contracts/timestamping/etc) that will probably equate to &gt;100MB/minute (1gb/block, or 1.5MBps of combined on+off chain throughput)
No single solution is enough.

gas is still way cheaper. $0.025-0.04 of natural gas is about equal to 1kWh ($0.15 for many)
so *IF you have natural gas heating available*, mining isnt really using "free" electricity, but instead a "pro-rated" ~$0.12. thats enough to make buying an S7 semi-appealing, but wasteful for anything thats &gt;0.5w/GH

but we're not there yet, and it would still have limitations to the members of your "hub".
IMO it will work great for 'internal transactions' and that will be the first usage of it (such as repeat contracts), but broader usage of it will probably lag by several months since it only makes sense if you expect to transact many times with a specific hub.

now UASF is a sales pitch?
last time i read through its documentation it looked like a way to force segwit activation and (once again) saying "blocksize is just fine at 1mb. we will deal with that later". 
segwit is fine, but calling it a scaling solution is a farce. even if it works, we will have full ~1.7MB blocks within months and the only way to keep transaction fees down would be to use L2 networks for all your payments. 
segwit+2mb is supported by jihan and is far superior to BIP148. if all the miners who signal EC/BU came together with all those signalling segwit, it would be &gt;70% support of the compromise. (as a bonus, 2mb probably has greater support than the less-tested emergent consensus.)

this is true. Im heavy on the BTC side, about 50% of my net worth (i dont own a house, so BTC is about equal to my car, cash, and some stock holdings). 
of that BTC though, about 30% is in the form of mining hardware - which has significant cash value and a strong local resale market, even when the BTC price is volatile. 
tbh though, i would never suggest putting &gt;50% of a net worth into a single asset. You should always have &gt;$3000 cash available for emergencies, get rid of your debts, and hold at least 30% of your net value in things like house, car, or stocks.

Exactly. hashrate doesnt just "turn on" 30% of the network overnight. Even larger farm setups take days or weeks of installing and powering up individual sections or racks of the facility. Its not like this is a single miner flipping a switch on some magical new 200MegaWatt facility in the chinese foothills.
realistically, there may be some ~10% increase in hashrate possible, but the 30% reported is due to luck. the hashrate isnt real, but an abnormal quantity of quickly-mined blocks make it seem that way.
there was a similar 20% movement in estimated difficulty about a month ago thats barely noticed in the longer trends. stop panicking

Mining should be a competitive market. It's in the interest of miners to be picky with what they want to include in a block.
If most miners say "I'll validate anything &gt;50sat/byte", then users will either need to pay that much, or wait a longer time for a less picky miner to include the transaction.  It's similar to fee priority right now, but it's a softer size cap imposed by miners, rather than a hard limit imposed by the protocol.

If miners are not getting enough through fees alone, THEY will set the price, and choose to ignore low-fee transactions. That's thier choice and the miners can specifically include or ignore whichever transactions they want when mining a block
And seriously, running a node will likely never cost that much. Hard drive capacity grows at the same rate roughly as bip101 so you could likely buy a 20TB storage drive for &lt;$100 by the time it's necessary (today, it only needs a $30-50 sd card or hdd). Same goes for Internet. If you get 1MBps today, same price will get you 1GBps by the time blocks are greater than 1gb/ea in size.
So the only way you'd have a $30,000 node would be if you built it today with a dozen 2TB hard drives (~$150/ea), had a 1GBps fiber hookup (&lt;$1000/month?), and operated a cluster of i7 cpus capable of 50,000+ TXps verification ($5,000). Oh, and a chassis built of solid gold ($20,000)

however, I have plans that if BTC goes &gt;$600 I will be putting at least $300 into buying a larger safe and putting it in a more secretive location with all my long-term storage materials, and using the current safe for 'loose change'

as i understand the links:
zcash was getting 1-2MB/block, and taking anything from 5-10+seconds to getblocktemplate and validate transactions with huge amounts of signatures. Because a zcash block is 2.5min average, thats a huge hit to mining that cant be done until validated. Some users found 4GB or less of ram to be insufficient (pagefile might help?)
fortunately, a big range of factors lighten that for bitcoin. the 10min bitcoin block makes any delays less costly (in terms of % of blocktime), SPV mining allows miners to mine on just the headers while validating the transactions seperately, and miners are free to choose which transactions they want to put in a block so can chose to ignore burdonous transactions. the network can even softfork in limitations for the size of individual transactions
in terms of nodes relaying the info, segwit helps. but so do extension blocks or thin blocks. IMO segwit with 4MB (1+3) of data places no more burden on (an optimized) node that 2MB+2MB does, and would satisfy many people in the scaling debate i think
@_date: 2015-10-08 02:34:05
been over this before - if a miner produces a large block its an orphan risk. they only produce blocks with transactions whose fees make them worth the time/work (thats the real supply and demand)
the blocksize limit is trivial, it limits how many transactions can be processed, with no actual effect on how many are MADE

+1 to the trezor. Its easy to use, and follows common daughter-address trees so you know that the 12-24 word code you make at the very beginning can always restore your coins if you lose the device or it fails on you.
and then to spend coins is easy and extremely secure because you don't worry about scanning paper wallets or exposing yourself to a vulnerable computer (such as bitcoin-stealing malware)
I say buy a trezor and make two accounts (different passwords), one holds 10-20% of your coins and uses a password you can remember or otherwise commonly use. This is the decoy. The second password is more complex/unusual and holds 50-60% of your bitcoins. In the case of theft or coersion, you could protect the bulk of your assets by giving up the 'decoy'. then put the remaining 20-40% into paper wallets and/or digital media (microsd or usb), ideally with a password (BIP32) and tuck them away safely.
you may even consider n-of-m in future, and distribute the parts to trusted people or locations around your house.

It's exponential though. 3x increase j the user base would likely result in a 9x increase of transactions as those users would begin sending transactions amongst themselves.

Ver is just part of bitcoin politics, but I think to an extent the miner's know better than to get sucked into silly fights. Bitmain has personal reasons (spite, asicboost) to oppose segwit, but at the same time the other side has done nothing to address maxblocksize.
I think the miner's know that increasing fees threaten bitcoin's L1, and as long as blocksize is limited, the $/kb for non-segwit data will increase. Building L2 shouldn't be done at the expense of L1

segwit doesnt offer enough. it might be enough for a few months, maybe a year at best before we have 1mb blocks with an additional ~2mb witness data, causing onchain transactions (including L2 settlement) to become expensive again.
blocksize still has to increase, and im slightly paranoid that segwit is being pushed hard by individuals/companies that are invested in L2 solutions and want to make them cheaper and more appealing than onchain transactions.
ps: is something wrong with being a "big blocker" - what difference is there between a 4mb block, and a 1MB block that has 3Mb of witness data? someone running a node still have just as much data to download/validate/relay. 
it makes sense to have significant headroom in the blocksize. what if bitmain stopped mining for some reason and the network lost 20% of its hashrate? blocktimes would be 12 minutes, and blocks would be 20% bigger until resolved. with headroom, thats just fine. without headroom, the transaction backlog would be immense and fees would skyrocket

@_date: 2017-05-05 13:56:19


and i think thats the biggest barrier. the hong kong consensus was to make a hardfork with 2mb blocksize AND segwit, that has a 4mb cap on the base+segwit total size.
since then, theres been no real push for 2mb from core devs, and segwit is now being pushed as a blocksize increase. once segwit lands, its almost certain any blocksize increase will get delayed further because of reasons like "segwit is working", "theres plenty of room in witness data", "blocks are no longer full", etc.
even if their opposition of segwit has no technical merits, i agree with thier sentiment that a blocksize increase BIP/HF needs to be porvided (or at least supported) by Core. *and im talking about an immediate change to 2mb, as opposed to some of the very slow linear/exponential increase BIPs that could take years to reach 2mb*

the antminer S3/S5 both did quite well, as did the Sp3x (if bought at the right time or in bulk). I know the brief period of paycoin mining added almost 5% roi as a nice bonus. another consideration is i spent my BTCs on mining equipment when it was &gt;$600/BTC and that equipment mined a significant BTC/BTC profit (but roughly broke even for USD/USD), and helped shelter/hedge me against the fall in BTCUSD
as for GPU - I built a $1200 rig near te end of scrypt mining and made about 30% of its cost back via scrypt and then X11. It was converted to a gaming PC for a while, and ten recently made another ~40% return from mining ethereum. Thats about 70% of te costs back and the hardware still holds a solid $600 value.  A few more months of ethereum or another profitable coin and it will pay for itself (and still have $500+ resale value)
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:37:56
segwit enables a degree of scaling, but the basic blocksize will continue to be a factor even if we hit an optimistic 2-3mb combined data. segwit might push that back a bit (months, maybe a year?) before blocks are full again and fees start to rise once more.
IMO the 2MB+segwit (4mb cap on combined data) proposal is the way to go and might appease bitmain

not everything is without controversy.
sould the central bank maintain the current interest rate until 95% of citizens can agree on what the new interest rate should be? It would never happen
95% is rediculously high a bar to set. all it takes is a single pool or a few large miners being too lazy to update, and the fork will never happen even on updates that are uncontroversial. 
75% *might* be a little low in comparison, but 3:1 is a pretty strong vote. typically governments decide a supermajority as &gt;2:1
If you want to argue for a stronger consensus, 80% or 85% might be valid arguments, but 95% is just silly. look at the fact that antpool can easily veto any kind of segwit hardfork (and could simply ignore segwit transactions if its implemented as a softfork - causing delays even when paying significant fees or having the blockspace) and you sould understand that full consensus is impossible and 'majority rules' need to apply beyond some threshold like 75%

segwit is not onchain scaling though. at best it opens up a bit of the 1mb block by shuffling data off of it, but that will almost certainly fill up instantly with the mempool we have. itll be quickly back to full 1mb blocks, with another ~1MB of segwit data, within months.
we cant disregard the need for miner-controlled blockspace. its a core feature of bitcoin and creates a distributed mining governance. (yes its semi-centralized right now, but ASIC tech is hitting its peak and the S9 units being shipped worldwide by bitmain will run for years to help distibute the network better.
honestly the anti-bitmain hate makes no sense. Bitfury has just as much hashrate but hasnt sold miners to the public (unless you want a $200,000 shipping container full) since 2013/2014.
 But because bitfury supports segwit a lot of people here seem to think they are champions.

thanks for the link, i forgot about that attack.
nevertheless, as you said, various forms of attack would be obvious in advance (i doubt it would be instantaneous, and only a small portion of the network may be misled initially), and others could be prevented with basic checks (such as checking for massive swings in difficulty or hashrate)
eventually, I assume we will see whitelisting/blacklisting in one form or another, ideally with no impact on fungibility or miner listing. If one knew that specific nodes were operated by companies like apple/intel/walmart/amazon/etc, it would be reasonable to occasionally check these 'trusted' ledgers against the 'trustless' ones . A discrepency (on either side) would raise flags and warn the user to advise caution against an insecure network

why not segwit+2MB? jihan has indicated support for that proposal.
 "segwit *is* a blocksize increase"  isnt a valid argument against raising the actual blocksize limit from what was set 6 years ago when blocks were less than 5kb and a block &gt;1mb truly would have been spam/ddos. the bitcoin network has grown far beyond that and blocksize is a bottleneck

i see this happening in the next 5 years, and being commonplace within 10.
having control of a 'registered' bitcoin keypair could allow better tracking/taxation of bitcoins (its going to happen, this is the smoothest way to implement it), as well as acting as an identifier similar to an SIN/SSN.

But that's if you upload 64mb/10min back to the network. At a more conservative 2:1 upload ratio, 8mb blocks would only mean ~85gb/month
Not to mention requiring the network to have 8x it's current transaction volume AND optmal usage of the signature space. We won't max out 8mb on day 1, it may take a few years to reach that, esp if L2 solutions start being used with segwit

That saves some space, but isn't a magical solution.

generally, overclocking reduces the power efficiency (not as much as overvolting though) as you start getting more power loss in components when they are pushed to their max

i agree there are benefits to a softfork, but a well-planned hardfork could ensure the vast majority of users are updated for compatibility in time. Im in general agreeance with segwit, and it will become more time-tested as other blockchains implement it first. But its built for L2 applications and ignores the *additional* need for a simple blocksize increase. IMO the 2MB+segwit (4mb cap on combined data) proposal is the way to go and might appease bitmain
as for the cost of running a node, if segwit can enable *up to* 4MB/block (3MB of witness data) - anyone running a full node would be keeping and verifying this data as well. so there should be little or no difference compared to a 4mb blocksize increase in terms of bandwidth, storage, and cpu usage.
imo node scaling is not a major issue. yes, rpi nodes may no longer be enough, but an rpi2 or rpi3 node is. with 2/4mb blocks you might need an rpi4 *(doesnt yet exist)* in a year or two. or build an itx computer system for $&lt;400 thats sufficient to handle the blockchain up to 2020 even with growing blocksize. in the future (as it is already), most p2p uploads are from a minority of nodes that have massive bandwidth and more system resources (like an i7 server in a 100MBps datacenter). home users with 100kBps upload rates work great as a decentralized verification system, but not so much as a p2p backbone, regardless of scaling

hes being absurdly paranoid (linux users can be) that the OS or hardware could still compromise security.
gernerally speaking, linux is the most secure OS you could use, and also fairly lightweight. However, if you made a netbook loaded with winXP/win7, AVG, and, bitcoin-qt - you would have a pretty reliable and secure system. 
the hazard always lies in the exposure of your system to the internet. mindful clean installation of windows is ~99% as secure as a linux install

Up until it has 75% consensus it was fully compatible with bitcoin core.

the segwit+2mb is the obvious solution that keep L1 fees down. jihan is (legitimately) afraid that "segwit as a blocksize increase" will make $5 L1 transactions seem normal while L2 can offer $0.05 fees because its nodes are running on proper server systems and not an rpi on DSL

i think playing politics is to diverge for the simple "increase the arbitrary limit that was supposed to protect from obvious spam/ddos" to "segwit is all we need"
the consensus 2017 idea of "segwit that includes a 2mb blocksize change after 6 months" is great IMO.
UASF forces segwit with the pretense of making the blocksize debate obsolete (at least for a few months until we see full blocks again). If this silly debate rages on for another year or two segwit will have crippled bitcoin into acting as a expensive settlement layer for L2 solutions and 'true' peer-to-peer bitcoin transactions will be costly.

thats an extremely unlikely scenario. you're saying that someone would fork the network by changing all the nodes. That would be immediately defeated by miners producing the next block, assuming they refuse to download a sudden change to the ledger and mine atop it.
AFAIK an attack via control nodes is virtually impossible (please provide me a source if i am incorrect), since the miners are the ones who actually create(d) the blockchain, which they broadcast to the nodes

assume one could find a way to 'safely' (ie: from TOR, or outside jurisdiction) attack a GOVcoin, or otherwise use a 'burner' connection (such as gaining access from a registered account/IP/location to conduct the attack, and then flee)
the crucial element to any blockchain is its security. Be it security of a centralized system housed in the pentagon (and/or other secure facilities), or nearly $500M of hardware operating in unsecured, decentralised locations.
Right now, publishing a transaction to the Bitcoin blockchain is the de-facto read-only solution. IMO this presents opportunities even greater than bitcoin as a simple currency, since even a token 0.0001BTC transfer can include an uneditable timestamped entry to the ledger, which can/will be potentially recorded forever by humanity (alongside scanned images of paintings, digital copies of literature, and all other digital media worthy of protection)

- you will be hard-pressed to find a netbook in the &lt;$100 range that includes a 250GB HDD. a lot are little 60GB or 120Gb drives (again, suitable for short term, might need &gt;120GB in another year or two though)
-size and simplicity. the bitnodes comes ready-to-run, just plug it in and make changes via web browser from your normal system. its about 1/4 the size of a netbook, so you can easily hide it in beside your router
to each thier own. a netbook obviously has the most functionality *if* you plan to use it for anything more than a node

I don't disagree - I didnt go far into the 'free power' math since it doesnt really apply to my situation. Its probably closer to your 8-month estimate than it is my 6-month estimate.
for free power, older-gen gear makes more sense. The S7 would ROI on free power much faster than the S9.
IMO, at 3.9BTC and 0.07/kwh i think theres a good chance of ~10% ROI after about 16months, which isnt very impressive and likely not worth the risk.
At 3.5BTC (if BTCUSD were to jump up near $600), it could probably make a 20% ROI in the same 16months. I would take that risk.
@_date: 2017-05-29 01:21:23
thats not the point hes trying to make.
bitcoin transactions are expensive because theres a cap at 1MB. meanwhile segwit (whose main purpose is to enable L2 solutions - like the ones core/blockstream have been working on) is capable of taking "free" space to hold all the signature info needed to handle L2 functions.
Jihan has shown support of the segwit+2mb proposal which allows more blockroom to drive now blockchain fees, while still giving segwit for L2

@_date: 2016-05-31 16:27:20
Im making fairly basic assumptions that:
1) at halving, difficulty will drop by ~30% over the span of a week or two (I assume some miners are slow to turn off, and others turn off instantly, but turn back on after difficulty drops 15-20%)
2) Price will stay the same, at $~520
3) roughly 5% of brandnew network hashrate per difficulty period will come directly from S9 sales. (ie, after te first 2monts from halving, difficulty will stabilize around 5%/jump).
paying nothing for power, you have about 6 months to recoup cost. paying $0.07usd/kwh it will take more like 10-12 months.
There are a lot of other factors of course. Bitfury sales beginning could turn it into 7-10% difficulty jumps, and price movement could drastically change both the ROI and also affect difficulty.
TLDR; it will pay for itself with free power, if not in 6 months, very easily within a year or its hardware lifespan (but an S7 might be a better deal). With cheap electricty, its a gamble.
*personally, I intend to buy one if BTC price rises enough that the unit costs 3.5BTC (its currently 3.9BTC), and have it hosted at a location that charges me $0.06usd/kwh (plus tax) all-inclusive

Imo (and it's a total guess), for every 1000 users we need 1 node that's hosted within a data center  (ie: GBPS speeds), a few dozen higher nodes (desktops or severs with &gt;2mbps uploads), and maybe a hundred nodes that are able to upload more than they download, if only barely (and mostly for the sake of a well-dispersed network, they can be pruning and still be sufficient)
But to be totally honest, that one powerhouse node (imagine if versizon/ATT/Microsoft were running them in their major datacenters), could probably handle propogation to hundreds of peers over fiber optic network bandwidths, and the majority of home-based nodes are simply a copy of the ledger with a mediocre upload rate. If that means for 100 Million users, there's 1000 of these powerful nodes (and 10,000 other well-connected peers), i would still consider it a decentralised network. Anyone could still run a spv/pruning/full node, and have access to a copy of the blockchain that is free from censorship/alteration, and verified by millions of peers as legitimate.
We just need to be realistic and recognise that someone in the sticks with dialup networking isn't going to be the one who is propogation new transactions and blocks to your own node. Instead, they are really just acting as one of the millions of copies of the blockchain around the world

How would it damage decentralization? That's a tired argument with no backing.
Small miners mine on a pool, so they have no changes to their bandwidth usage or even mining setup. The pools they use will be responsible for handling the larger blocks (which is trivial if it's a dedicated server with an Internet hookup that costs &gt;$100/month)
Larger miners with thier own dedicated nodes will need to be sure they can support higher bandwidth. 1MBps is sufficient, 10MBps is overkill. Both are achievable through a decent network hookup or fibre/satellite up link. Again, trivial costs for anyone who is mining &gt;$10,000/month to spend a few hundred (at most)on a better network link.

security flaws due to negligent programming or "unused" code is somewhat common though. Antbleed is severely overhyped, and thankfully was spotted and corrected before it could be used as a hacking/attack vector. On a scale of 1-10, it scores a 6 for risk, but only a 2 as "proof of bad intentions"

segwit2x might stand the best chance so far. a majority of mining appears to support it (so far), and it seems like the best solution by making both sides happy and offering the greatest benefit to the protocol.
That said, i hope devs on all sides of the table can come together and giver segwit2x a thourough code review before we implement anything too haphazardly - and i suspect many people are poring through the beta code to test for flaws and help improve it

Spv nodes and pruning nodes both do different versions of that
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:14:10
miners can inpose soft limits (like the 750kb limit that was an issue a year or two back) in order to produce thier own dynamic fee market, selling blockspace as a commodity in a competitive market.
strangling bitcoin with a 1mb cap forces fees to increase even if miners were willing to validate for much less. scaling with segwit/L2 can help in the short term, but the 1MB limit will quickly become a bttleneck again.
segwit definitely helps the UTXO handle more transaxctions, but at the same time computational ability is growing rapidly. weve had full 1mb blocks and no issues for almost two years - 2mb should be fine on ~80% of nodes out there, and the remainder just need to look at buying an rpi3 to replace there pi/pi2

It's curious that earlier, big blocks were derided as unsafe and dangerous to nodes and centralization  (and still are), yet the idea of "segwit is a blocksize increase" is somehow immune to all these harmful effects.
A 1+3mb segwit blockchain has almost no difference to decentralization and node requirements than a 4mb blocksize does
Luke-jr was arguing mere months ago that the 1mb blocksize was too big, and more recently expanded on that by claiming that reducing the blocksize is a good idea because with segwit it would still be &gt;1mb
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:16:01
doesnt make it any less contentious.
in the end, PoW runs the system powered by users. Whichever system offers fast block times, secure blockchain, and low fees will have the most users. (obviously BTC/segwit2x right now).
If it doesnt catch on it will be left behind and abandoned. but i expect it will take a few weeks to see the value fall and the hashrate go back to the profitable segwit chain. If it does catch on, you might see its hashrate and value rise hand in hand as miners chase profit (through the users and their fees)

The CAD/USD has lost almost 30% in the past 12 months. During that time, bitcoin has barely moved outside of $230±15 range (discounting spikes that last less than a week)
Most major currencies fluctuate ~1%/day, bitcoin is around 2%/day. Not bad
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:54:36
I dont think BU/EC is the best solution right now, but it might be useful down the road for more fluid scaling in the future.
segwit offers some relief, but there will still be the issue of the 1mb limit for non-witness data, and it wont take long to get htere again, and segwit forces bitcoin to act as an expensive settlement layer for L2/L3 services
segwit+2mb or "segwit, then 2mb after 6 months" are both aggreeable solutions IMO. both are infinitely better than forcing segwit via UASF
@_date: 2016-05-04 16:09:57
it is, but bitfinex and huobi each see 25,000-50,000 coins moving on a daily basis, and sometimes 100,000+ on busy days. (im ignoring the ludicrous 1M+ volume huobi has been reporting the last few monts since thats illogical BS)
even if a million coins were quickly dumped on the market (about a half-year worth of mining today), theres enough volume to eat it up pretty quickly. a 1-day dump could probably cause a &gt;50% price fall that regains muc of the price within a few days, while a slower release could probably take place over a few months and negate any effects of the halving.
IMO the coins are either lost forever, or would show up if/when bitcoin needs a shot in te arm, either via distribution to faucets or as large transaction fees to support miners during an event like the halving or any other kind of hashrate "stall-out"
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:01:37
That's my point. They wouldnt, and the reason for the empty block is most lilely due to how it was mined (ie: headers-first because the contents of the block are still propogation from a different bitmain facility)

Hard to say. Up to a minute later I'd hold by my theory. 
Beyond a minute, I can only speculate, but still assume it's for technical reasons rather than to avoid collecting fees.
*regardless, miners are free to assemble blocks however they choose, and if they think mining an empty block will lead to a full mempool/ higher fees, they run the risk another miner will just take the fees. However, if this was the reason the miner would probably still include a small number of highest-fee transactions, and not a purely empty block*
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:24:11
i wouldnt call it way out of context. if you read the whitepaper and some of what he posted in discussions, he had a pretty clear and mostly-accurate image of how miners will act (7 years strong!) and forsaw lightweight/SPV nodes that would be fed data by much more powerful 'supernodes' (my word).
satoshi knew that in future not everyone would be able to run a full node, or to do so on a $50 rasperry pi. he talked about scaling the the size of 700MB+, commenting how in a short while it would seem trivial to propogate that much data quickly over the internet.
satoshi's no god, but he was pretty damn insightful when he talked about how his network would look years or decades later.

IMO bitmain has been selling asics to the community since 2013, while spondoolies-tech, knc, bitfury, avalon, asicminer, rockbox, and BFL all either failed to deliver profitable hardware on time, went bankrupt and no longer exists, or have extremely limited amount of sales to the public at prices that cant compete with bitmain.
if bitmain wasnt selling to the public, or plainly didn't exist, the hashrate would be ~40% of what it is right now and essentially dominated by bitfury (who only sells to private entities who want to buy shipping container farms for $100,000+)
I dont think bitmain is perfect - they skirt copyright laws, dont sell chips to others for assembly, hve a fairly mediocre unchanged webUI for the miners, and asicboost does threaten to give an unfair advantage (but as a patented optimization isnt really out of line with what incentivizes miners to fight for PoW dominance- you wouldnt expect them to opensource the silicon design for an upcoming 8nm ASIC).
as for prolonging asicboost, theres no reason why we cant see core and/or another dev team design/promote the segwit+2mb fork and let the users decide whether they want to flag that AND/OR bip148.

something like 2mb+segwit isnt really horse-trading though. it obtains the benefits of both, extending the blocksize while including segwit for L2 purposes.  make a 4MB cap on the total block+sw size, and a 500kb cap on individual max transaction size to eliminate quadratic validation issues
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:20:37
Payment channels still require occasional settlements, or injection of new coins. Today, LN with segwit would be more than enough to keep blocks well below capacity, maybe even if we had 5-10x as many users. But in a year or two we might exceed that capacity.
Not to mention the fact that there are many reasons why you want a max blocksize that's sufficiently larger than the average blocksize so that in times of extreme mining varience (or if a major mine goes offline temporarily), a longer blocktime doesn't result in a backed-up mempool

Having more than one type of node is a part of decentralization. I agree that having options (core, XT, etc) is a positive thing.

@_date: 2015-03-10 21:52:34
block size is irrelevant - it affects (slightly) the fees but is really more an arbitrary level based on reasonable bandwidth.
21M BTC limit should be considered as immutable though - that maximum is the very backbone of the system, and cant be changed*
*however, if in 50+yrs from now it becomes apparent that number creates a flaw in the system, it may be reasonable and necessary to increase the size via a well-organised hardfork. This would be 2 reasons:
1) fees dont actually allow mining properly
2) deflation becomes a serious problem
either of these would have to be to an extent that it is causing a serious system collapse. IMO, neither one is likely as the affect on the system would naturally correct itself (hashrate would decrease/fees increase, OR massive deflation leads to a surge of another altcoin(s) that causes money to leave BTC and drop the value)
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:23:01
I'd dare say it's not a such a threat to miners, as a threat to the 7Yr stable protocol. 
Blocksize can (and is) controlled fluidly by miners and nodes beyond the simple definition of maxblocksize. Orphan rates and creation of a competitive fee market both induce miners to artificially limit block size anyways. In 2015-2016 we had the issue that many miners using bitcoin core had a soft cap of 750kb enabled and it was causing mempool backlog and increased fees.
Despite whatever space segwit frees up, 1.7mb (or up to the magical ~3.7mb) effective size via segwit won't offer much cushion against a growing userbase. We need 8mb effective size by 2020 if we want to control fees and enable continued adoption, and that can't be done on a 1mb blocksize 
Miners are afraid of forcing bitcoin into a high-fee network where the L2 token is the only realistic way to transact

Absolutely not, it would not achieve anything because either a hard fork is necessary but the scheduled change is months away, or a hard fork is triggered without any fundamental changes.

The best force for decentralizing the network (within sha256) is to make mining profitable for more people, so it's not only done by those with &lt;$0.05/kwh power. That means improving the profitability of mining through increases In $/btc or fees/block. Onchain scaling offers to increase fees/block while decreasing fees/kb

nodes can diverge at a fork that has a different algorithm, but that doesnt mean bitcoin itself does, and those nodes would be without the security of a global SHA256 hashrate. as long as even a few nodes remain, the bitcoin (sha256) network will function.
Nodes have very little effect on consensus outside of simply choosing/refusing to propogate certain transactions. But a node itself doesnt indicate much about its owner (in terms of economic stake), while miners have an obvious and measurable presence through PoW

They go hand in hand. The latency of downloading a full block is replaced by only downloading bloom data plus transactions not already in the mempool. That's almost 900kb less data needed to download per block (whereas the current protocol involves downloading transaction data AND uncompressed blocks (or about 1.6-2.0MB/block))
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:21:19
but we have everyone's attention. segwit+2mb might just be the compromise that gets it done.
BU/EC has 41.6% miner support. segwit has 29.3%. if they can agree on the compromise you have 70%. add in those that support the new agreement and/or supported 2mb but not EC, and it could have 80%+ support within the same timeframe as UASF
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:29:36
Well the core nodes would have a minimum of hashrate and stagnate quickly (if blocks started taking 1hr+ to be mined, the transaction backlog would become insane, and the next difficulty change could take almost 2 months to reach). In such a situation either users would follow the hashrate (as per the general pow "longest chain" logic), or a contingency such as pos/pow change may be required. Either one of these would likely result in segwit2x becoming the longest bitcoin chain, and/or the creation of a uasf-coin that isn't operated with sha256d
On the flipside, if the miners' chain has no real userbase, then the bitcoin's they mine have a greatly reduced value due to a lack of buyers. They might decide to follow the users and step in line with the segwit-only rules of uasf
Personally, I think the miner's hold more power than users due to the pow hashrate they control, but they still require a subset of users to actually want the currency. Just as a minerless uasf fork needs a certain fraction of miners to successfully reach the difficulty adjustment and ensure transactions are actually able to go through.
Tldr; I think the economic and pow consensus functionalities of bitcoin will retain their importance, and in the event of a fork a clear majority would arrive on one of the chains within a matter of days or weeks (likely faster than it did within ethereum during the eth/etc split)

Jihan recently did a presentation (linked in another comment) where he was able to better explain his view of the network, and how in bitcoin (and most other open source developments), there exists a sort of benevolent dictatorship controlled by the lead maintainer (originally satoshi, then gavin andresson, and now greg maxwell), balanced with some of the values of a development panel (the rest of the developers and more-involved community)
I'd agree with his views there, which are generalized and don't intend to point any specific blame or criticism, that the general direction of bitcoin development is steered by a small group of developers who are responsible for most of the day-to-day coding work.

We still need full nodes, but I personally don't follow tge "everyone needs to run a node" logic. P2p file transfers work just fine as long as there are enough uploaders to satisfy the larger number of downloaders, and so can bitcoin. One node with high quality resources/bandwidth can be 10-100x as "useful" as a node with a slow cpu or poor upload speeds
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:55:45
Off chain should be cheaper yes, but segwit is still onchain data, except that the witness data has no associated fees. So a 1kb transaction will have the same fee as a 1kb (+X kb witness) transaction, despite the fact that that additional 'X kb' is still imposed on nodes and miners to store/validate/propogate.
Ideally for everyone involved, a larger blocksize (let's say 2mb), could mean lower fees/kb but higher fees/block

ive always seen it most positively when looked at as a currency for countries with currencies that are losing value through rapid inflation or volatility. Maybe not as a replacement, but as a hedge against their traditional savings.
instant irreversability and the distributed ledger also present a bunch of different benefits that may not help everyone, but are very useful to some.
Say you are selling a product online, and buyers either dont have paypal or are overseas and will result in higher banking fees and longer time to send a wire transfer. Using bitcoin means that the payment is received quickly without worry of charge-back, and it might be 1-2days faster and $20-50 cheaper than a wire transfer.
Theres also no worry about exchange rates, where your bank or credit card may have a 2%+ spread int hier exchange rates

Unfortunately for you, bitcoin is pow, where work=having an input. That's why hardforks require miner support via millions of dollars in specialty asic hardware.
What you want is a vote based on your economic participation, or pos (proof of stake). bitcoin isn't that, but other cryptocurrencies are. And simply running (or spoofing) a large number of nodes isn't meaningful.
Bitmain could operate thousands of segwit2x nodes and it would also be mostly meaningless because they all share a single bandwidth and thus offer virtually no benefits  to tge network comoared with a single node having the full bandwidth available to it

Please, elaborate on how miners increasing the blocksize (and supporting segwit) will give me higher fees
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:54:53
A casualty of signalling? Signalling is great and helps a hardfork be enabled only when a majority of the miner's have updated to the signalling version
Guess what happens if miners decide not to update? It's apparent in the signalling, and indicates the fork is not supported (or at least prepared for) unanimously, and that there's a danger to anyone who forks to a chain with less than aajority of the hashrate.
Gee. It's like bip9 actually works, because we still have a singular chain and not a disastrous 55:45 split where a segwit fork has minority hashrate and the network is plagued by re-orgs and reversed/disappearing transactions
@_date: 2017-07-05 03:16:02
miners and nodes already have the ability to softlimit.
thats why about two years ago we had frequent 750kb blocks despite large mempools, because some miners were using core's default 750kb soft limits when mining 
Just because we raise the hard limit to XX MB doesnt mean miners will produce full blocks or include every transaction. they will create a fluid fee market with soft limits on blocksize and minimum fees to balance fees with competition between miners.
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:57:29
Whoops thank you. I'm just finishing my coffee

I don't endorse 30gb blocks, that's just what 8 billion tx/day would mean with current transaction format. Obviously off chain transactions will reduce this substancially
And uasf/segwit still force nodes to validate, store, and propogate blocks up to a potential 4mb.
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:05:24
You only need a single &gt;1mb block to trigger the increase. 
And if you didn't have enough in the mempool for that, a miner could just create a custom transaction that includes a large coin base message. No need to stuff it with dozens of 'fake' transactions as implied

not sure hoarding cash will do much good, particularly in economies where abnormally high inflation rates might occur. that $1000 might buy 3mos of groceries right now, but if inflation spirals out of control in a few years it may only be sufficient for a month or two of groceries.

@_date: 2017-07-06 17:34:37
What's the segwit2x trojan? I've seen absolutely nothing to indicate that exists.
As for node centralization, look at the fact that vanilla segwit still requires nodes to validate, store, and propogate up to 3mb per every 1mb bitcoin block - it's essentially a 4mb (more like ~2.7mb) blocksize except that there are no fees associated to the additional data and it forces users to use segwit or pay much higher fees for blockchain transactions. Realistically, a segwit node and a segwit2x node would have similar requirements, at up to 4mb/10min.
And higher fees/block actually leads to decentralisation as people can profit from mining even at higher electricity rates. Lower fees/block lock makes mining less profitable and only those with cheap power (like bitmain) can exist.

the system is burdened by the 1MB limit, otherwise these transactions could rapidly flush through in 8MB blocks and the situation would resolve 8x faster
@_date: 2017-07-08 12:58:21
Obviously we can't scale infinitely on chain, and I think most people see that. 
But 1mb is quite small, and offchain/L2 solutions haven't yet become commonplace. Increasing the hard blocksize limit (even as a cankick) should be the simplest and quickest way to relieve fee pressure and set the mood for real and honest discussion of how to scale further.
Even if L2 does become more widely used, 1mb blocks can only act as a settlement layer for so many transactions before hitting the limit again and having higher fees.
Part of the miner concern with segwit is that the witness data is "free" (no weight when calculating fees/kb) and despite requiring up to ~3mb worth of validation/storage/propogation there's no extra fees to miners, and it forces users to utilise the segwit format unless they want to pay ~3x the fee for a legacy-format transaction, even if the segwit format offers zero other benefits to the p2p transaction they want to make

@_date: 2017-07-06 17:28:23
Pow blockchains rely on a strong (and diverse) mining backbone for security. More fees incentive more mining. In fact, of fees increase enough, mining becomes profitable again for more people worldwide. Right now you need &lt;$0.05/kwh to stand a chance, but if there are more fees, you might stand a chance even at $0.10/kwh
I agree we can't infinitely scale onchain, but that doesn't mean L2-only is appropriate. We need both, and segwit2x presents itself as a combined path forwards without the delays imposed by bitcoin core as they work to push segwit out prior to scaling the blocksize.
And segwit does have a skewed rewards mechanism. Fees are only assigned for the traditional data, and not the (up to 75% of total size) segwit block, despite the fact the witness data still must be validated, stored and propogated by miners and nodes. Forcing the network to handle the witness data for 'free' is the issue jihan is talking of. (Yes it would mean less fees for him, but his point is still valid and applies to all miners worldwide)

look at more that a single twitter comment. While his own writing can be cringeworthy, the medium articles he posted should be indicative of his opinions on scaling.
such as within the last week:
He supports the segwit+2MB proposal (I do too), yet core developers are still pushing a segwit-only agenda with BIP148/UASF which is essentially a softfork takeover attempt that doesn't require a super-majority to enact.
IMO segwit+2mb is a good solution, but segwit alone as a reason to not increase the max blocksize is total BS. to quote satoshi:

Why would they be empty? Most estimates are that we would see a slow uptake of segwit usage, and it might take a few months before we saw an 'effective' 2-3mb blocksize (1-2mb of witness data per 1mb of transactions)
I want bitcoin to handle a 10x influx of users, and that means a large mix of segwit transactions but also legacy-format transactions. LN isn't here yet either so don't expect massive offchain scaling for another year or two. 
Even if we didn't have full blocks, or even blocks &gt;1mb after the fork, there's no real harm caused by having a limit with healthy space available. Doing so would help the blockchain kep up during high-transaction periods, and miners/nodes could even impose softlimits on blocksize to better control it (just like many used to set a 750kb cap even when the hard limit was 1mb)
@_date: 2017-07-05 02:04:38
exactly. onchain has limitations (like slow verification) that L2 has solutions to, but is also a key function of bitcoin. miners/nodes should be able to softlimit blocksize from a hard limit that is MUCH more than the average blocksize

so you want to take a cheap consumer device like a $50 DVD player, and add in a $10 circuit that produces ~3cents a day while the unit is plugged in, while using about 1kWh/day of power (which is about 10-25cents for most of the world).
why would i want to buy a DVD player that bleeds money when its plugged in, costs 20% more, and is ALWAYS hot to the touch even in the summertime?
the fact is that there are datacenters all over the world that pay &lt;5cents/kwh and will be running rack-mounted systems that draw MEGAwatts of power to mine bitcoins at a slim profit margin. sticking a doofy little novelty miner in consumer electronics serves no benefit other than to create a lot of heat while losing money

My cryptocurrency portfolio is about 85% bitcoin (it was 90+% before, but I've been diversified a bit in the past few months as ethereum grew in popularity)
I think a lot of people are disregarding the knowledge and understanding of miners and pool operators. Miners can have a huge impact on when/if/how transactions are included jn blocls, and firsthand experience with the impact of latency or geographic location on their orphan rates.
When a large part of the hashrate can effectively agree on something (demonstrated by signalling), that's a strong and measurable opinion they are providing. It's not the only opinion that matters - but it's still not something to disregard. That's why segwit's 45% support, and now sw2x's 88% support, should be a que to users and developers
Miners work for users, but still have an array of methods to control block size and contents through rules such as minimum fee, maximum block (or even tx) size, and even being capable to not propogate blocks that they don't agree with (though that means a much higher orphan risk for their work on the shorter chain)

Many of the miners supported BIP91 over BIP141 due to the agreed 2MB/NYA component, which will technically be a hard fork even if it had 99% hashrate.
I fully expect a fork in november, but one that has similar levels of hashrate support as BIP91 is receiving, and goes off without a hitch in a similar fashion to bip91's segwit

even if you shut off all the miners, you still are paying rent, wages, utilities, etc - it might work out to $0.01-0.02/kwh of these base fees and by buying instead of mining they would have to consider that they are "paying" about 20% more because of the fixed mining expenses
to shut off a 100kW/1PH facility for a month (1 or 2 difficulty re-targets to get to the needed equilibrium) would probably cost $5000-10,000 while not producing bitcoins (after halving, approx 35BTC/month, or $23,000). simply buying coins would both push up the price and cause a dedicated mining facility to be "overpaying" by at least 20%
obviously the guys mining at home or in the garage would not have these costs, and be best suited to turn off until the difficulty falls or price rises
@_date: 2016-07-10 14:38:34
oh yeah? free land, free buildings, free ventilation systems, free staff too?
unless the miners are stealing power it almost certainly isnt free. cheap, perhaps - a lot of remote areas near hydrodams have inexpensive electricity because of excess and the very short distance to transport the power to the mining facility(s)
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:13:00
damn that's pretty looking :)
I love that it can include a message on the blockchain, as well as having 25.xxxx BTC because transaction fees are included in the block.
however, as with all physical coins I have two concerns:
1) the premium of ~$3000 (assuming ~4.5BTC is an aweful lot, yet not entirely unreasonable. At 28BTC I'd probably buy one though.
2) security. I trust*ish* BTCC, but hologrm coin wallets can play host to a bunch of vulnerabilities, such as BTCC having a copy of the address, the block getting unreadably damaged, or even plain old theft. I have backups to all my wallets and most of my paper wallets are BIP32 with a few copies made for good measure against fire/theft
to that extent - can you specify the address to BTCC that will be used, such as a vanity address and/or BIP32-encrypted? It would allow you to keep a digital/paper copy of the keys in order to never have to damage the hologram, and BIP32 would protect you from BTCC employees somehow retaining a copy of the unencrypted private key

It's important to understand that miners are really just "mining nodes". If nodes define consensus, than so do mining nodes. The only difference is that a mining node has a demonstrated economic staking in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:48:45

i agree. the price took a hit, but there was an insane amount of actual progress made within bitcoin. new record levels were seen for hashrate, transaction rate, VC investment, and the amount of media coverage.
regarding price - I think there are stil a lot of early investors with hundreds or thousands of bitcoins that they made 1000%+ gains on. They are likely selling into the market slowly over time to convert digital currency into thier own native fiat or are buying things with bitcoin. In either case, these bitcoins then move to buyers who see an upside and are likely to hold or use the coins. It could take a few more months, maybe years, but an equilibrium will be reched, and then price will rise in relation to user adoption
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:25:09
to follow the reactor analogy though, imagine the fuel's remaining energy as the inverse of moore's law for the capabilities of storage, bandwidth, and processing power in a node.
over time, the technological capabilities of nodes grow, just as the nuclear fuel burns up, losing radioactivity. As that happens, the reactor is no longer at capacity - you CAN pull the graphite rods up slightly to reach a new equilibrium based on the fuel's energy
A node today may only be able to handle xxMB - but in just a few years it may be trivial to upgrade its storage, or bandwidth, at a reasonable price. today a 1TB drive (roughly 4yrs of 4MB blocks) costs &lt;$100. In 4yrs when its full, you could probably find a 4TB drive for &lt;$100, and handle 4yrs of 16MB blocks.
Theres a slew of technical arguments for why even an unlimited blocksize would probably be well-handled by a network of nodes+miners that impose soft limits on what they mine/propogate (just as some people may instruct thier nodes to disregard &gt;1MB blocks if segwit2x activates), creating a risk/reward tradeoff where a miner of an "undesirably large" block may see it orphaned because other miners refuse to mine atop it or propogation speed is limited by nodes that refuse to relay it. *But obviously theres a slew of risks associated also.* 
As such, a small increase within technical capabilities (2MB or sw2x) is a method of slightly reducing limitation of the system in a managable way (1MB worked fine since years ago before the RPi-v1 even existed - 2MB is managable today on a hobbyist budget), and allow study of its impacts on node count and latency/bandwidth statistics

Proper activation thresholds are what will help avoid a 2chain split (ie 85-95% support), and that's for segwit and/or 2mb.
The amount of flak bitmain/jihan is getting for not shifting his position on the issue is silly, when you look at the fact core and many davs have refused to shift on the blocksize increase for an even longer timespan. We need compromise, and I think 2mb+segwit is that

thats likely at the lower end of the operating range (ie: underclocked/volted), and likely just at the chip level.
make it 0.08j/GH  for realistic operations, add 0.01j/GH for DC/DC and other PCB component losses like a microcontroller, and then add ~15% for power loss across the AC/DC and AC/AC transformers.then 2% for immersion cooling power draw.
most likely it will be in the range of 0.1-0.15w(480VAC)/GH. This would be better than the SP100 which boasts 0.16w(220VAC)/GH, with heat removed via airflow

In 10 years, to handle 30GB blocks (1600TB/yr), a full node might require 1600TB to store a year of blockchain: 
~$56,000 today, but likely &lt;$2500 in 10 years when you consider that 10yrs ago a 100GB harddisk cost about as much as a 4TB drive today
You could use pruning though and probably suffice with 50TB or less, which might cost &lt;$200 in 10yrs time

I took the top comment's reference to ~8Billion tx/day if everyone on earth did a single "coffee" transaction daily.
realistically, I hope we could have 8 (maybe even 80) Billion tx/day in a healthy, diverse system of on+offchain transactions and keep the blocksize &lt;1GB/10min
edit: Bitcoin Xt wanted to have 8MB today, doubling every two years to reach 8GB in 2036, which is 20yrs from now (my 10yr example would be 256MB using the XT roadmap)
@_date: 2017-07-06 19:53:51
The $20k/node number is pulled from someone's ass. $20k would be enough for a node that handles ~8 GIGABYTE blocks today, and most of the cost would be storage (easily reduced by pruning)
Even L2 solutions need to tether/settle on the blockchain occasionally, and that will require onchain scaling. Segwit alone can't scale past a point without increasing the blocksize.
we can't scale everything on chain. That's obvious. But onchain scaling is still required. Imo 4mb today growing to 1gb by 2040 would be feasible to nodes and necessary to settle visa-scale off chain solutions
@_date: 2017-07-06 20:22:17
The only place I've seen the 20k number was a post a day or two ago that was just a quote of a uasf twitter account. Afaik it had no real math behind it.
And yeah my numbers came from my ass, hence the imo. I assume that there will remain certain usage cases for onchain p2p transactions and that up to 5% of transactions will be onchain even when L2 solutions become prominent. 1gb/10min would only be about 750kbps to download, which will seem pretty trivial in a couple decades
The math someone actually did was that 8 billion transactions/day (1 per person on earth) would be roughly 30gb/block or 1600tb/year. So if we had a 1000:1 settlement ratio we would be looking at 30mb blocks for 1tx/person/day.

BIP148/UASF claims segwit is tested and ready to go.
Bitcoin Classic (2MB) and BitcoinXT (8MB) both had testnets and code review for a hardfork blocksize increase.
Segwit2x takes both of these, and adds a few extra lines of code to establish the secondary activation date for the 2mb fork following segwit implementation.
so other than making a segwit2x testnet and trialing it with some full blocks, what other testing would it need that wasn't done to segwit or 2mb individually?

most people can handle 8MB/10min download speeds - thats negligible.
the real issue is the upload rates, and in some cases, data caps.
1) if your issue is a data cap, then consider upgrading service. most places will increase 300GB-&gt;unlimited for &lt;$10/month
2) if the issue is uploading 8MB/10min to 8+ peers (8:1 share ratio is promoted by some people due to the number of "leechers" who dont offer significant upload rates), then you can upgrade your service or accept that at a ratio less than 1:1, your full node is not beneficial to the network and you should consider lightweight/SPV alternatives
meanwhile, theres someone with a colocated server that has 16TB+ of extra space and a gigabit connection through the newest fibewr optic networks, capable of a 1000:1 share ratio at way more than 8MB
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:57:39
I think it is worth representing different versions of a bitcoin node, as it is not a necessity for all nodes to use the same Core system, and the utilization of various forks (software forks, not an actual blockchain fork) helps to demonstrate user preferences.

Eth is anything but dead. That's pretty obvious.
In your world of "everyone has a full node", you would only be relaying once, not 8 times. The idea of 8 uploads for every download is based on the idea that 7/8 nodes can't support uploading. And imo that's fine - let nodes in data centers that have GBps speeds act as seeds for the wider network of lightweight nodes, just like how p2p torrenting works.
 one powerful node with GBps speeds and a hard drive big enough for the entire blockchain can support dozens (hundreds?) Of pruning nodes

is rbtc synonymous with supporting a blocksize increase - or with the jihan/china mining monopoly that wants to destroy bitcoin despite years of profitable mining?
because i think segwit+2mb is a real scaling solution that has support on both sides. UASF/BIP148 is a minority attack on the protocol by forcing others out of compliance with a new rule, and is touted as an alternative to segwit2x when in reality it should be a failsafe at best for if segwit2x consensus cant be reached
@_date: 2017-06-16 18:58:03
I disagree with the first part - Moores law (and the similar laws for bandwidth and storage capacities) state that our technology improves exponentially by about ~40%/year , doubling every 2-3 years.  If the blocksize doubled every 4yrs, we would easily stay behind the improvement of technology (and would have us using 4mb blocks today). Outside of quadratic hashing, which can be solved by setting a maximum per-transaction variable, there's very little reason to think that the bitcoin p2p network can't match the growth of other technologies. 
That said, not all transactions will occur on the bitcoin blockchain - L2 offers real solutions to things like refunds, smart contracts, and instantaneous payments. 
Ideally, the average block should be about 60-80% of the maxblocksize so that the fee market is dictated by miners and nodes, rather than by a hard limit in the software.  What if bitfury went offline for a week, and we lost 25% of the hashrate? With full blocks we go into a massive spiral of rising fees, but with extra blockspace, we could keep fees the same while filling blocks to 90-100% capacity and survive the period of ~13min blocktimes.

the procrastination on a blocksize increase is every bit as irritating to some as the procrastination of segwit is to others. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:31:47


1) not all core nodes are the latest version, and running core software doesnt mean an indication of segwit/bip148 support, just like running windows 10 doesnt mean you support the new windows app store and being asked to rate your experience with default apps
2)   is a far better resource, and filters out duplicate nodes (such as multiple nodes on one IP address) as well as nodes that non-listening. The result is ~85% of nodes run core, which is still the majority but a far more sensible number than 96%
3) the group that agreed to activate segwit didn't automatically agree to do UASF/BIP148 at the same time. Thats like assuming YOU want to implement segwit2x because you support UASF

Technically bitmain would be continuing to mine the current chain, without choosing to implement bip148.
It's bip148 users who are causing a fork to occur and are actively seeking miners' support right now.
It's a pain to see non-action being blamed for a fork that occurs from the actions of another (potentially minority) group. Status-quo doesn't cause a fork, implementing contentious protocol changes are what makes the fork occur.

your best bet is buying older-gen stuff thats practically free (an S3/$20, S5/$70, SP3X/$300), assuming the excess electricity is "free" and you ave no other ways to put it to use or resell it into the grid.

UASF is a final backup, but segwit2x should be the focus now to deploy and try and get consensus with.
if segwit2x cant get consensus, then UASF might make sense to support, but for now i see it as an attack against the established PoW system because it can have negative impacts against those that dont upgrade, AND can be activated without a majority/supoermajority
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:04:37
What level of decentralised do you want though?
Do you need a network where 100% of the globe runs a node? 50%? 10%?  1%?   Realistically a handful of nodes with massive bandwidth can support a network of non-propogating/lightweight/spv nodes and still meet all the riteria of decentralised.
Just because some people don't have &gt;100kbps Internet or 240gb of harddrives space doesn't mean everyone is the same. My gaming computer has 2tb of space and 2MB/500kB bandwidth. I could easily handle 8mb blocks (if not closer to 32mb) assuming a maximum per-tx_size&lt;1mb to avoid the quadratic hashing issue
@_date: 2016-05-30 22:28:13
So let's assume relay is as good as it gets for miners. (for now)
Thinblocks benefits every single node on the network, not only miners. Luke-jr isn't a miner and has always been steadfast that his bandwidth cannot support larger blocks. I suspect the outcome of this scientific study will show that thinblocks could solve his problem very easily
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:18:27
Exactly. If quadratic hashing is the excuse against bigger blocks, a max_tx_size is the obvious solution.

@_date: 2017-07-13 19:51:21
the network will still operate, the biggest hazard is if some nodes are not ready for segwit, and the possibility of chain re-orgs as sw2x and vanilla blockchains compete for the longest chain.
instead of the typical "3-6 confirmations is safe", we're probably looking at "6-10 confirmations is sfae", and the chance that your transaction may be undone in the case of a reorg right after its confirmed.

Imo asicboost is a bit of smoke and mirrors as a tactic by those who oppose bitmain. The power savings it enables are not much different than those seen by gpu-&gt;fpga-&gt;28nm-&gt;20nm-&gt;16nm-&gt;14nm, or when Intel charges extra for the 'K version' of a cpu.
Sure, I feel a bit cheated that bitmain might be able to force extra hashrate from an s9 and I cant, but the s9 still performs at the advertised specs that made me buy it. Just like when I look at my i5 cpu that has a locked multiplier preventing me from over clocking it.
Sure it's not 'fair', but neither is the fact bitfury will only sell me hardware if I have $200,000 to spend on it. Bitmain has done a great thing for bitcoin by selling to anyone and everyone, enabling a healthy distributed hashrate. At times it seems like bitmain/china/jihan is a scapegoat in the segwit-vs-blocksize debate
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:32:31
We could have fixed half those problems with the 2mb increase proposed by btc-classic, but the segwit supporters/backers came up with a dozen poor reasons why a hard fork was a contentious attack and somehow an altcoin.
All so that they could benefit from L2 solutions they designed, and are now advocating a contentious soft fork in order to achieve.
We need scaling onchain and via segwit together. The idea that "segwit is scaling" and can push back actual blocksize improvements leaves a sour taste in my mouth. For all the bitterness created within the community, core has never released any sort of blocksize increase code/client, and fought off anyone who did by claiming classic/xt/bu were some sort of takeover attempts or altcoins
@_date: 2017-06-16 19:01:15
The limit was set when the average block was 5kb. The idea was that any block/transaction that was submitted at 200x the average was likely spam or ddos.
He suggested encoding something as simple as "when blockheight = xxxxxx, increase maxblocksize to ____"   assuming 1mb is a permentant limitation is like the misquote of bill Gates saying Noone needs more than 64mb of ram.

i think he means that basic transaction info, espescially if you have a hierarchical wallet that is constantly making new change addresses, makes tracking transactions pretty difficult.
if you want true untracability, theres still mixers and altcoins that you can move value through
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:56:43
The arguments against it (in your link) boil down to:  it makes altcoins less appealing, it reduces transaction fees, and a 20mb blocksize (twenty!) Would mean a node has to download 2.8gb/day.
Not everyone can or should run a node, and the network shouldn't be limited to satisfy the weakest links. I can download 50gb+/day and have all the resources needed to scale up to 20mb blocks today.
We need to try scaling onchain. It's doable and the single biggest risk is the hardfork, which can be smoothed out through proper preparation and advance notice

the whole thing s politics. we need code support on all sides and there can be consensus
@_date: 2017-06-23 14:29:20
the problem is that UASF supporters are imposing a minority chainsplit that could mean that the general rule of "4 confirmations is safe" might need to be "10 confirmations is safe" due to the much larger chance of a reorg, and services/exchanges that havent properly prepared could spend coins simultaneously on both chains, effectively burning/destroying legacy chain coins because of the invalid segwit format.
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:34:56
Quadratic hashing is easily solved by imposing a maximum per-tx_size so no single transaction can exceed ~500kb

If bitfury  and bitmain both signal segwit2x, its likely many others in both the segwit and BU camps will join in and we could see 50%+ support pretty quickly.
@_date: 2017-06-05 01:55:53
sounds like you were not here. i sure was.
in 2014 ghash had 40% of the mining power, most of which was bitfury's private farming. BTC-guild had 25%. Thats 2/3 the network controlled by 2 pool operators. The community rose up to the problem and began to diversify. The rise of bitmain and global sales of antminers played a big role.
now, mining is centralized based on electricity. Areas with cool temperatures and &lt;$0.05/kwh are prolific mining locations worldwide. making mining more profitable enables those with &lt;$0.10/kwh to make money mining, and that means an increase in fees (through blocksize growth that still means lower $/kb fees to the user)

Only if (or while) it's more profitable than ethereum/zcash/etc. And my fears about 'insider advantage' still remain - who's to say that an algorithm won't be chosen where luke-jr already has an optimized mining code that's 2x as fast as the opensource miner, and kept secret between him and anyone who pays a licensing fee (or dev fees)?

@_date: 2017-06-11 22:03:36
How is it not simple to change maxblocksize variable? Obviously it's a hard fork but with some warning it takes maybe 5min to download a compatible client.
1mb was imposed as a limit at a time when the average block was 5kb (or less), and zero-fee transactions were generally included in the next block. The idea was that if a block came through at 20x the average size, it was likely zero-fee spam.
Maxblocksize should be set substancially above the average blocksize in order to keep fees down and prevent unnecessary backlog of transactions.
What's complicated is the way segwit rewrites the procedure for creating and validating transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:55:50
It depends on your view of pow I guess, whether it should be "everyone should participate equally" or "hashrate arms race"
I've always followed the assumption of an arms race, and was aggressively mining btc during 2013-2016 but couldn't justify an s9 and moved to gpu mining again.  When we are in periods where the reward is very valuable, everyone who has access to newish (s9,s7, maybe even s5) can run it profitably and it drastically improves the decentralization compared to periods when only &lt;$0.06/kwh can turn a profit.
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:05:30
old equipment is cheap because anyone who is paying for power cant run it profitably, and/or the newer generations of gear are 5x as efficient.  in terms of $/TH they are the best deals. instead of $130/TH from the S9 series, you can get an S7 at $95/TH, an S5 for about $70/TH, or an S3 for about $50/TH
keep in mind the greater amount of electricity needed, and heat produced, for comparable hashrate in older equipment. As well as the additional power supplies and power/networking hookups to deal with the larger number of machines and W/TH.
not to mention the environmental impact. using an older generation hardware is like plugging in a space heater for no reason - its pretty wasteful compared to higher-efficiency hardware.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:59:47
Changing pow is a slippery slope when the original sha256 is secure. Changing it will create a massive void of hashrate and a significant attack vector.
Firstly, who chooses the pow, and how long will it take to optimize the algorithm? What's to say those who choose the ago haven't already developed an advanced algorithm or asic that will provide massive day1 benefits to only select 'insiders'? If you thought asicboost was cheating, then this is purely atrocious
Secondly, right now you'd need hundreds of millions of dollars to buy enough sha256 hardware to attack the network. But on a new pow, a 51% attack might require 1/10 the hardware investment, likely into gpus that could be easily liquidated once the currency's value to massively damaged.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:16:12
It's not so much against segwit, as it is about the fact that increasing the blocksize *would* be trivial to do if it had the full support of core.
I think there's just been a massive campaign of "nodes can't handle it / it will cause centralization / segwit-is-scaling / hard forks are bad / china firewall creates chinacoin" and not a single release by core with the ability to flag/implement a blocksize increase.
All this time, blocks were full and fees rose. And everyone was told that segwit is the only solution, and a blocksize hard fork is an attack on the system that will result in an altcoin.
My big fear is that if segwit is put in place, and we see some breathing room on blocks again, the next year or two will revolve around "segwit works. Just use L2 and we don't even need to risk a dangerous blocksize fork" which is entirely against what bitcoin needs to become a global p2p platform.
Segwit2x is a real proposal that ensures scaling on chain following segwit implementation and hopefully  shuts down this argument and gives users lower fees
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:16:06
But segwit will be limited by the impact of maxblocksize on the non-segwit data
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:54:39
Decentralized doesn't mean everyone has one, it simply means that anyone who wants on, CAN have one - even if that means spending a bit of money on a real computer and a broadband connection.
To expect that a global network should be based on the weakest link is silly. As long as there are independent nodes that can provide information from the blockchain to spv/pruning/non-propogating nodes and services, decentralization is alive and well
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:11:18
Mostly because segwit is way more complex than simply optimizing the protocol to safely handle more data throughput.
ive seen few demands from ver/bitmain. theyve supported basic blocksize increase methods since XT/8MB+Thinblocks, and attempted to simplify the code in Classic/2MB due to the FUDstorm following XT. Now they support segwit2x in the hopes that compromise can still enable a basic level of onchain scaling.
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:02:54
There's a few basic concerns, namely increased resource consumption by nodes (we will lose some of the dialup nodes, big whoop), quadratic scaling where a single 2mb transaction takes 16x the validation effort of a 500kb transaction (easily resolved by introducing a cap to individual transaction size), and some work to ensure the signalling/forking is done as quickly and harmoniously as possible.
But it really isn't that tough overall, the core function is essentially "at blockheight=xxx, change max_blocksize=2mb"
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:10:28
a single blocksize is a step of scaling, just like segwit (what did you think happens when the segwit blocks either hit the 1MB block capacity or the 3MB segblock capacity?)
bigger blocks can mean more fees for miners AND less fees/kb. its a win for users and miners.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:04:21
Bigger blocks allow more fees which makes mining more profitable and enables people to mine even in areas where power costs $0.09+/kwh
@_date: 2017-06-30 20:05:33
because they honestly believe that scaling onchain is at least *part* of the solution. they even support segwit2x as a means of scaling onchain AND enabling better L2 networks
 On the other hand, UASF is actively planning a flagday that could occur with minority support, cause a chain split, and create insecurity within the blockchain due to the probability of a re-org

It's also hard not to imagine a scenario where core and/or blockstream are the first ones to release a functional lightning hub, and get a massive headstand on collecting transaction fees from it as all they need to do is offer the service for slightly cheaper than the miners (whose high $/kb fees are created through the supply/demand caused by a limited blocksize)

The new code is segwit with a time-delayed 2mb. It's tough to screw that up unless the issue lies in segwit.
As for signalling, they can change signalling to the new flag and code with about 5-10 min of effort.
If miners can't be bothered to take a few minutes to alter the path of bitcoin (their income source), then maybe it's not such a great code...
As for the 6mos delay, where's that come from? Is it part of the code they will release, or just an estimate at how long to get the majority signalling? Uasf is set at 3mos away anyhow and still shows an obvious contention.

But nodes themselves do not do mining work, and as such cannot enact the changes that miners can.
You can spoof node count, but not hashrate, and that's why hashrate/block flags can be such a powerful indicator of consensus. (Yes miners might have a unique agenda, but they depend on the success of bitcoin and as such want bitcoin to succeed and have onchain transaction appealing to users)

Higher fees do way more for decentralization because more people can mine profitably. Restricting blocksize (and thus total fees via skyrocketing $/kb costs) is what makes mining profitable only where power is cheap/free.
The strongest decentralization comes from everyone being profitable, and fighting to deploy hashrate. It's like a real world goldrush: the more gold there is, the more people that can start making money with a single pickaxe. But when there's very little gold left, only those with bigger equipment and a streamlined process can succeed
@_date: 2017-06-11 03:16:50
the theory is that miners need X fees to survive, but not really justify new hardware. less than X, and the costly miners (&gt;$0.05/kwh) cant profit. more than X, and miners with power at up to $0.08/kwh can keep in the game, and those &lt;$0.05/kwh justify buying more hashrate.
right now the fees are dictated by a limited supply, and thus high BTC/kb fees. by providing more space, BTC/kb fees can be less than they are now, while the total amount of fees in a block increases and keeps the miners happy.
miners can even set soft limits on blocksize - for example refusing to mine more than 1.5MB, or otherwise setting a minimum fee threshold in a block, despite a 2MB maxblocksize in the protocol. This would establish a proper buyer/seller marketplace rather than the current "Ill give you more fees than that guy is offering, JUST TO GET A SPOT!"

2mb code (classic had it) is also ready to go, but weve seen the debate get extremely heated over issues like china centralisation and nodes not keeping up.
i think the general fear is that after all the FUD and arguing thats delayed (what should have been) a simple increase in maxblocksize, if segwit is implemented it may releive the pressure enough that the "nah, segwit IS scaling - we dont need &gt;1MB because of L2" argument is brought forward and we see blocksize kicked further and further down the road as fees keep rising and forcing users on L2/sidechains and creating a secondary fee market
a healthy bitcoin needs plenty of headroom in the maxblocksize AND the ability to power L2 solutions. Forcing one without the other limits bitcoin's functionality (either creating a settlement system that costs $10/tx, or enabling cheap transactions that take 30min+ to get a few confirmations (rather than more instantaneous capabilities in L2)

some early asics were flops, and others were more successful. Pretty much everything prior to the Antminer S1 failed to be very profitable. The S1 (and to an extent the megabigpower bitfury) -onwards all did fairly well and got positive returns
mostly due to the fall in btc price, mining difficulty started to flatten out faster than a lot of poeple expected for 2014-2015 (IMO)

"you know those guys who support Segwit2x? Yeah, theyre totally cooperating on it."
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:07:51
Why? Because luke-jr is a sensible individual? Or that the asicbleed FUD wasn't just some unused code that bitmain should have (but didnt) deleted from the ant miner software?

@_date: 2017-06-18 15:35:03
No, this all really started with a call for 8MB or more (ie follow the original concept of "unlimited" space so miners and nodes can set a free market around blocksize and fees
efforts to compromise that down to 2MB were still called an altcoin and that the barely-developed (at the time) segwit was better
now we know segwit should work, but blocksize still has to grow regardless. the "segwit is scaling" argument is a BS reason to not scale the blocksize. The idea of keeping it 1MB for several more years is a joke
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:47:16
they owe it to preserve general features of bitcoin's POW. changing from sha256 is the very definition of an altcoin. switch it to scrypt and make the blocktime 1min and you'll be an exact clone on litecoin
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:25:27
I think the future of physical coins will be based on a centralized bank with the coins acting as redeemable items for the digital coin. (much like coins and paper money today). Bitcoin is made to be digital and a physical carrier adds no digital value, only a fancy cold storage method
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:24:42
It's naive to assume they are focused on short term when they have millions invested in sha256 pow.
Bitmain supports a blocksize increase, and so far core has vocally dismissed increasing the blocksize as contentious forking.  Yet uasf has backing because they stand to gain from L2 development and fees.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:49:17
Bitcoins core principle was becoming a global p2p currency, which very much means scaling bitcoin.
Beating other coins just goes hand in hand with offering lower fees, better security, and more functionality.

A store of value needs to retain value, often through being unique
If everyone moves to ethereum (or other cryptocurrencies), than the value you stored in bitcoin will lose its value.

Ive been here for several years and im not a fan of UASF - its a slippery slope into other UASForks whenever consensus cant be reached, and IMO defeats the purpose of PoW consensus.
that said, if segwit2x cant be achieved in a reasonable timeframe, UASF might be the last option. but i think segwit2x has the support and just needs the code to be released and spread among nodes/miners so we can get a clear idea of support levels. (THIS MEANS CORE NEEDS TO GIVE SUPPORT AND RELEASE A VERSION OF IT ALSO, since i'm sick of the "core vs alt-client" arguments)

It's just a shame that it's overpriced. If it was a gen2 product at under 2w/gh I would almost certainly buy one. But at 8w/gh before overclocking, this will stop making a profit by the end of January I think.
@_date: 2013-11-06 14:24:52
Not much of a better,but i am comfortable holding onto all my coins until at least 300. Mtgox has already broken the 266$ record so it's not insane to think a rally (or climb) to $300 won't happen in the next week. Btce should get 265 by week end(~280gox)
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:22:19
Wtcr has been a good reseller of asicminer in the past, so i would assume it's a real product. However, they do not make note of the power use if it's a gen 1 product (3 blades and a psu arranged into a square would be capable of 30gh and overclockable to the suggested 35-39gh) or a gen2 product Noone has heard of
@_date: 2013-11-05 17:22:10
An educated guess. Based on past movement and the general concensus that bitcoin may be worth A lot more than its current price. Give it a week and let me know how close I was 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:38:13
If I'm not mistaken it would be roughly:
Chance a 25% pool finds block  before any other pool or user: 25%
Chance a 25% pool finds block 1, then finds block  before any other pool or user: 25%*25% = ~6%
So there is a 6% chance that the scenario can be Initiated. However, the rest of the network holds a much better chance and would override the hidden blocks most of the time. In other words, an evil pool would have almost no mining income and if successful would only achieve the fact of destabilizing the value of bitcoin

There are many bitcoin millionaires already, it's actually a good pr idea to offer to accept thier coins for a novelty space ride. I would imagine if it means even 5 bitcoiners decide it's an awesome way to celebrate thier richness, the pr stunt worked

I think if it crosses $270 we will be entering a bubble. I would expect it to consolidate around 220-240 soon, so it will likely hit a peak (I'm guessing 285-320$ range) then drop down at least $20 in only an hour, then taper over a few days until it bottoms at 200 and steadies at 220-240.

Casascius's holograms were 'hacked' about a month ago at defcon or a similar conference. Since then, he has begun to employ holograms with laser etching along the edge that would be far more difficult to remove. IMO the next big concern would be to ensure someone else can't buy/make a hologram identical to yours that can be used to replace the removed/broken hologram.

Why not just remember that 0.01btc is ~$3?    (ps: you missed a decimal point so have fun remembering that 1mbtc is something like 30 cents lol) this is exactly why mbtc forces no benefit other than confusion.

In 8 weeks bitcoin could rise 30%. Still seem like a good idea?
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:22:11
Both in my case. I bought some close to $110 and more at $180, plus some physical casascius
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:22:18
Problem is that without advanced hologram stickers, the coins could be tampered with. Casascius's has begun to use more and more advanced methods to ensure the hologram can't be peeled or removed via solvent and replace without visible change. However, using a cheap $2 tamper sticker like what these seem to indicate offers minimal protection against careful unseating of the sticker then reseating once the private key has been seen. This wasn't a big issue when a btc was $20 but at $200 it becomes far more worth the time and materials required to steal the info a resell an empty coin or a coin with a balance that might dissappear days weeks or months after purchase
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:53:34
Can this argument stop being an issue? If someone is too cheap to get a bitcoin because it's several hundred dollars but 1000mbtc is a big number and totally worth it, they are an idiot.

Mtgox is a terrible exchange to use. They have the highest buying costs, and had roughly 5.5M (usd) of their assets seized in the last few month

I'm honestly surprised it hasn't confirmed yet - usually 20min is more than enough time. Unfortunately, if it confirms before a competing transaction hits, you will have created a bitcoin address to which Noone knows the private key, basically removing the bitcoins from circulation forever (or until some sort of quantum but force is designd)
