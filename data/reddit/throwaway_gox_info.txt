I don't think anything nefarious is going on with the TIBANNE_LIMITED_HK / THK user.  It is simply the way cross-currency trades were implemented, combined with a bug in the way reports were generated beginning in 2012-11.
The leaked trade reports clearly show a different reporting format in months up to 2012-10 vs. starting 2012-11:
* The old format uses a single file (2012-10.csv) while the new format uses two files (2012-11_coinlab.csv and 2012-11_mtgox_japan.csv).
* The old and new formats have different sets of columns.
* The special user is called TIBANNE_LIMITED_HK in the old format vs. THK in the new format.
Ordinary single-currency trades look the same in both formats, with a matched buy/sell pair:
User A buys 1.2345 BTC for USD  
User B sells 1.2345 BTC for USD
Multi-currency trades look like this in the old format, with two buy/sell pairs:
User A buys 2.3456 BTC for EUR  
User TIBANNE_LIMITED_HK sells 2.3456 BTC for EUR  
User B sells 2.3456 BTC for GBP  
User TIBANNE_LIMITED_HK buys 2.3456 BTC for GBP  
In the new format, multi-currency trades are messed up, with the same buy/sell pair repeated twice:
User A buys 3.4567 BTC for USD  
User THK sells 3.4567 BTC for USD  
User A buys 3.4567 BTC for USD  
User THK sells 3.4567 BTC for USD  
As a result, we never see User B's half of the trade, and the special user THK appears to do nothing but sell.  Probably it is a reporting error, and the actual trades that took place were more like those reported in the old format.
