TL;DR He can continue his scammy life as a flimflam man and not go to jail.  
It means that he wasn't lying if he said he had millions in capital for his companies, which are floundering/likely scams and have already received about 50 million from the Aus govt, which is currently wondering what the deal is with his companies that seem to do nothing.  
Which probably means he would owe money to the ATO rather than go to jail for fraud, a far better option.

"Dr." Craig Wright is a long time scam artist/con man.  
Why would an intelligent and technically proficient man lie about having a supercomputer and spoof documents to prove it? Because he's a flimflam man.

Probably on the "supercomputer" he lied about having for the "class" he "taught" (which was actually just a series of presentations of bullshit) on supercomputing at the diploma mill.

Now **that** sounds like "Dr" Craig Wright.

The other lesson is for people to learn to do a bit of research. I have only passing interest in bitcoin but was able to suss out this guy's con man past pretty easily.  
I honestly couldn't understand the big mystery. "Dr" Wright's past is a pretty good indication of his character and future.

TL;DR His problem isn't the tax owed on Bitcoins. He owes $54 million for a likely tax rebate scam.  
His problem isn't the tax owed on Bitcoins. He took a pre-paid government tax break for about $50 million in cash for his shell companies. This means the Aus govt pays up front for a tax rebate for R&amp;D done by companies - .45 on the dollar - in order to help companies develop. The Aus govt. already paid out this money to his companies.   
Right now, he needs to convince the Aus govt that his companies were real and not a way to scam tax rebate money, which is most likely what he did, considering his fake credentials and diploma mill degrees, forged document to back up his lies about owning a supercomputer, white papers that say nothing, etc.

This is exactly the case.

Yes, but Satoshi demonstrated significant technical ability. A look into this guy's credentials reveals the exact opposite.

Part of a continuing scam by the flimflam man.
