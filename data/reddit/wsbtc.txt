You realize that only the promotion is new? You could have paid with bitcoins two weeks ago.

Perhaps we should get the guy who runs just-dice.com to run an exchange. Just-dice should be a model of transparent operations. Seriously go read the FAQ, he proves that the money is real and that the site is fair.  Just don't start gambling there. You will lose eventually.

Many currencies and easy conversion on the fly.
Sounds like Ripple to me. Which seems pretty dead now.

I am going to play the devils advocate here.
* They ran customer machines full out for 2 days before shipping...  That sounds like burn-in and it is pretty reasonable thing to do.  If the machine is faulty that is the most likely time for it to fail. 
* They kept the money generated during burnin.  Wouldn't you?
BFL is accused of being months late in shipping.  Having a 2 day burnin after manufacture is not evil.
* They created signs internally making light of all the people mocking them and complaining.  That is not illegal and pretty understandable considering how much flak they get.
This suit might have merit, but I don't see that they these complaints are very damning.

You people realize this is silly don't you? The CPUs in current phones can't even come close to generate a hashing rate that would be noticeable. Even if you have millions of them.  If you to get a _million_ phones running this 24/hr/day for an entire _month_ it might generate $200. total.

You people do understand this is hardware to create side-chains and altcoins right? This won't be mining actual bitcoins, just using the same sort of blockchain.
The idea is to use fake currency to balance resources.

I went ahead and took it, but I don't think you understand your audience very well.

if you do then they will want their original BTC balances. They don't have that much money. Instead, they will return the USD balance at the time of the loss.  Much less money but it can be covered when only a fraction of the coins were recovered.

To be honest, this approach might be less expensive than actually trying to use those cards to mine bitcoin. We are way past the point where is a GPU is profitable for bitcoin.

We already tried this. It didn't work. And these prices are not going to hold still, eventually, it will need to be uBTC.

I got the same call.  I forwarded the e-mail to Butterfly Labs because the call was so scummy I was sure it was a scam.
But then I noticed they happened to have the same email/phone combo I used with Butterfly Labs and the email didn't actually include any links.

I just sent you a tip of 0.25 USD using [BitTip!](

You have the gold and the silver!  That was a surprise.
That the bid column for LTC was empty is unfortunately not a surprise.

No it is brilliant.  He sends a $2 tip and then gets a $5 bonus from Coinbase when they signup for an account.  And people think he is generous.

This "fork" you are talking about already happened.  It is called litecoin and it already uses an alternative proof-of-work function that is much harder to implement on an ASIC because it requires fast access to large amounts of memory.  And the miners are already using their old GPU miners for litecoin.
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:56:01
which is a pretty silly thing to say.

"massive success"? Anyone want to guess the revenue of Butterfly labs? or Avalon? or another of them.
Intel made $12.6B first quarter this year.  Do you think a company worth anything close to that is going to come within 100 miles of bitcoin's litigation nightmare for something where $10M would be a pretty good income?
Companies with huge amounts of money are magnets for lawsuits.   Bitcoin is still in a legal grey zone.
