One reply is sufficient. You are cherry picking one issue which was promptly fixed vs how many people have lost their coins on their own accord. Some people are not IT ninjas and would be far more secure held by coinbase. Coinbase was also visited and checked out by Andreas A. and passed his standards. Gox was seen from a mile away, compare that business to a VC backed San Fancisco based tech startup of which has the developer of litecoin on staff. Worlds apart.

I think you mean phishing. That's really weird.. is that screenshot from an email you received? Is the email sender from an actual coinbase email account?

Agreed, nothing wrong with trading. I'm having a hard time getting a read of the future of bitcoin when the subreddits are full of so much speculation, panic, hostility, and sometimes a touch of smugness. If we want the currency to succeed, we need to focus on a long term vision for success of the coin and adoption with the community and perhaps it's just my perception but I feel like I'm seeing less of that lately. I like both Bitcoin and Dogecoin, but I agree with some of the Doge community that posted here about their experience and perception. I may not have been posting here much, but I've lurked for quite some time.

I don't understand why you wouldn't just store in a coinbase wallet? Somebody would need the verification code sent to your phone in order to gain access to your wallet.

Why wouldn't he just work a deal like win my case and I'll give you a quarter of the seized bitcoin pot. I would think the attorney would begin to salivate.

How about Applify? I liked appster... Can you not use it?
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:31:51
And truecrypt.

No they can't just do that without anything sufficient to backup those claims. If that were the case, bitcoin itself has a bigger problem. Also, coinbase wasn't affected by the heartbleed bug. Also noting, the post you shared wasn't recent, it's over 200 days old.

I feel like there is a lot of fear mongering and people hoping for a crash so they can load up on the lower prices. I'm not getting the vibe that a lot of people here are believing in it for its purpose as a revolutionary currency. It could be my perception, but it just seems like a lot of psychological manipulation lately.

If she didn't do anything illegal and the accounts are shutdown purely for moral or subjective occupational bias, then isn't this opening the door for a class action discrimination lawsuit?

I've used no script before but found it very annoying considering virtually every website today relies on JavaScript in some way or another.

Serious question, isn't the IRS ruling bitcoin taxable as property bad because it goes against the main principle of using bitcoin as an alternative to fiat currency? What is the selling point for layman adopters when all basic every day transactions are going to be more of a pain in the ass because of this tax ruling?

Note how they also fix it promptly and reward the whitehat. It's does not deserve to be dragged through the mud with Gox.

Why is it incorporated in Hong Kong but based out of Palo Alto?
@_date: 2014-02-12 06:15:49
Put one in Mountain View and Palo Alto

So, what should you do? I suggest coinbase but then you get people arguing against that. Should we print our wallets and stuff them in our mattresses?

Where did that 100k figure come from? The most I heard was 40k+ by the Winklevoss twins.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:20:14
The fact that people downvote this pisses me off because it is a completely valid and reasonable point that must be considered for bitcoin to grow.
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:22:16
I think it's an issue with both.

Man, what's with the nasty attitude? Be cool, you also represent the bitcoin community.

A few suggestions, Stanford shopping mall, University Ave, California ave., Castro St., and San Antonio/El Camino Real shopping area. My personal fav would be Castro St.

Where exactly is this ATM?

It's possible, but the major elephant that needs to be addressed is security and making it comfortable enough for the layman to use without having to be tech savvy.

Coinbase is fine. Gox was another beast entirely.
Edit: also want to say coinbase isn't a centralized party, It's a third party. In other words it's a company you can choose to work with, you can choose not to work with, and the free market allows others to compete with it. It is not the FED, it's doesn't create the coins and hold a monopoly with the government. It's a company that provides the service of securely holding the coins, let's you purchase or sell coins, and tries to make bitcoin more accessible for everyday people to use.

Doesn't the IRS notice money going to Coinbase, and if I recall doesn't Coinbase share all their information with the IRS?
