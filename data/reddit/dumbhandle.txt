If it cannot bring on a large use case on demand, it does not work.  It is gaining traction much more slowly than Ethereum.

It is not really crashing.  It's not doing much at all.  On a log chart, the price has been relatively unresponsive compared to the early days of the invention.
@_date: 2016-04-02 19:21:23
It has been a problem for over a year.  It is a major problem today.  No large use case can come on board and that killed it.
@_date: 2016-04-27 15:57:14
The transaction cap has not been solved.  We are still at less than 3 transactions per second bitcoin network capacity.  The market price of bitcoin diverged from the square of the transactions a long time ago.  The TPS problem still exists and the divergence is now much worse.  The transaction capacity of the network has to be much higher than the demand to not interfere with Metcalf's theory.  This situation is totally out of whack and I cannot see how there is going to be another hype cycle as long as the cap and capacity are so close to utilization.  There might be a bump, but it is not nearly as high as it could have been.  The damage done is exponential.

@_date: 2016-04-27 16:17:05
I don't disagree.  Moreover, doubling is not going to cut it.  The cap has to be so much higher than utilization that it effectively does not exist.  Otherwise, Metcalf is  limited.  A doubling is not going to fix the divergence much, if at all.

@_date: 2016-04-02 19:16:59
Bitcoin's capacity is limited by the consortium.  It cannot bring on any large use case quickly.  This makes it impossible to become widespread.  The consortium killed over a year ago.

Bitcoin was the only show in town in 2009.  In a few years, a Cambrian Explosion occurred.  Out of that rapid evolution came Ethereum, due to solving the Turing completeness problem. Developers that wanted a faster, more advanced, and more capable coin and system moved from Bitcoin to Ethereum.  Blockstream came on line, funded by AXA and other Bitcoin-specific businesses that could not pivot well to other coins. Who is left in Bitcoin, how capable are they, to what is their allegiance, and how psychologically stable are they? You have to decide this for yourself, but many have decided to move over to Ethereum to get away from the rot.

BTC has very little utility.  It is slow and expensive to transfer, it is not feasible for all but the most expensive transactions, for example, purchasing a car. Most of the people that have bought it have not used it.  If they had, they would not have bought it.  Why buy something that does not practically transfer?  Bitcoin has a huge market cap, because the media hypes it and it was first.  Low knowledge investors are prone to manias and pile on to trends.  And they are competing against hardened pros.

India is a special case relating to bitcoin.  Their currency, the Rupee, is weak.  Weak currencies can be attacked by speculators using what is called a short timing attack.   Basically, one borrows Rupees from a bank, sells the Rupees for a foreign currency.  More attackers pile on, driving the Rupee down.  Their Fed purchases Rupees to fight the price drop.  The IMF also lends a hand by selling the foreign currency and buying Rupees.  If it looks like the speculators are winning, more pile on.  If the speculator wins, the Rupee floats, devalued.  Spectators pay back the bank with cheap Rupees and make the spread.  Substitute bitcoin for foreign currency and the facts that their Fed and the IMF have no bitcoins and one will find there is no defense.  To preempt, the IMF and their Fed must buy bitcoin.  This general concept is being discussed by central banks now.  This is how bitcoin will discipline government when it spends too much and inflates.  I don't advocate this, but it seems like a naturally occurring process.

"Bitcoins can be transferred from Africa to Canada in 10 minutes."  This statement on bitcoin.org implies (to me) that
transactions take 10 minutes.
Maybe this would be better, maybe not:  "Bitcoin transfers are normally recorded in seconds to the worldwide database, which is called the "block chain".  Writing speed to the block chain generally depends upon Internet connectivity and the wallet software being used on both sides. A recipient can use software to immediately check if the transaction made it to the block chain and if fraud is being attempted.  This instant check is fine for everyday transactions.  Transactions become effectively irreversible after 60 minutes, making transfers of any amount feasible, including transactions over 1,000,000 USD.  The bitcoin network processes transaction worldwide in the same manner."

If I may build on your idea, when the price of bitcoin goes up, spending bitcoin increases.  It's nice to have toy here and there from the price rise.  Those that say that a rising price causes hoarding are only regurgitating what the TBTB controlled media are spewing.  More spending increases the adoption of bitcoin into retailers payment systems.  More adoption increases perceived legitimacy and then the price rises.  Price drops are not a good indication of the bitcoin future unless they come on the heels of those periodic bubbles.  Regardless, bitcoin keeps rolling forward overall over time.

Opinion:  Apple was making a play to mint their own currency and if possible, ultimately implement seignorage and reap the benefits normally held by states. Bitcoin beat them to it, so they played defense by blocking bitcoin apps from the garden. It became apparent that it was a losing battle, so they are now allowing bitcoin apps.  Expect sour grapes from Apple and less than total cooperation.  For this, I switched to Androíd and this should still be considered by iPhoners.  Google had no illusions of beating bitcoin, so they jumped on and are riding the wave, a realistic strategy from the beginning.

I run a corp cash management operation.  We had our email address spoofed.  The spoofer requested our customer to wire the invoice money to the spoofer's bank account in rural Alabama.  Our customer replied with a product question and we saw the spoofed email thread and stopped it.  We are in basic materials, so the loss would have been large had we not caught it.  We determined that our client's email address had been hacked and was being monitored for wiring instructions.  When large amounts are in play and the address is new, we confirm the bank address verbally.  Bitcoin is more of a problem, because addresses are new each time.  I am not sure how we would do this once bitcoin becomes the rails for international payments.  Won't be a problem for a while as no company would pay us in bitcoin right now anyway.

Your explanation is the reverse of Wences'.  Wences postulates that it starts as a store of value, progresses to a medium of exchange, and then finishes as a unit of account.  It is indeed a store of value now, having multiplied in value overall over the last few years and with many people using it for this purpose, like gold.  This hoarding is what is supporting the price in the face of the 25 bitcoin block reward.
The banks are testing it now for medium of exchange.  We already use it for allowance payments, settlements of personal debts, and incentives for feats of sport.  It is more convenient and useful than fiat for these purposes.
The unit of account is not here yet.   It would come around as prices are quoted in bitcoin and it is fully integrated into society, accepted as freely or more freely than fiats.  I expect this to happen around 2030 as hard AI comes into play and governments are outrun by the tech.

Would like a source for your 99.9% figure.  Conceptually it makes sense.  People generally do not keep cash in the bank.  Small business owners do.  They are a tiny percentage of the population, but they own 99% of the companies (No Man's Land, Doug Tatum).  These companies create most of the jobs.  When that money is stolen, the economy eats itself.  Large small business tend tto be efficient.  Upon failure of the sector, inefficient government and big fascist enterprise steps in. The bail-in is not a problem for normal people at first, only small business owners.  The collaps that occurs after the small businesses close is the economy killer. These businesses can be very large, but are normally under 100 people.  We are not talking about home based businesses.

This plays into into the hands of Bitcoin and demonstrates stupidity on the part of Australia.  Taxing deposits makes bitcoin more attractive as a store of value, which is all it is right now. Bitcoin needs around a billion hoarders before it would become a universally accepted medium of exchange.  Once the majority of retail transaction are done in bitcoin, price deflation will slow, thereby creating a unit of account characteristic.  That is the crossover, where all hell would break loose.

Curbside recycling does not exist in a free market.  It only exists where local laws require its collection.  The cost to collect curbside is high, because it is of very low density. Cost=20 cents per pound.  The free market cost to sort is also very high, because it is done by humans or extremely expensive machinery.  Human sortation is 10 to 15 cents a pound.   Baling is 1 to 2 cents per pound.  In our county, inmates of the local jail work at the sorting station so slave labor assists here, a good alternative for commies.  The baled material is sold for 0 to 5 cents per pound to various Chinese exporters, domestic compression molders and reprocessors.  The quality of the material is low.  The PETE has PP in it.  The HDPE  is mixed MFI and has PP in it.  The PP has mixed MFI HDPE in it.  Then there is garbage in all of it.  Polymers have to be 99.995% pure MFI to have significantant value Of 30 to 50 cents.  Curbside plastic is impossible to economically purify to that point.  As you can see, curbside recycling exists to satisfy commies' impulse to control and it is misrepresented to the rest of society to lull them Into that control.  I have never seen any curbside stream that did not have some level of government control or forced labor.

Glass has very negative end to end economics to recycle.  Mixed curbside has large end to end negative economics to recycle.  Municipalities force trash haulers by law to pick up curbside recycling.  The trash haulers charge you more to cover the cost.  The trash haulers move it to a MRF.  The MRF separates and sells what they can, usually to Chinese scrap brokers.  The rest is landfilled.

Let's say you are a manufacturing company in the US.  You have an obscure Italian motor on your machinery that goes out and you have no spare.  The closest one is in Italy and it costs USD11K.  You need it flown in now.  Everyone in your business is panicking.  The Italians want a wire, because they don't know you.  Well, now Dodd Frank require 3 days for the wire to be irrevocable, so the Italians don't get your wire for 3 days.  Your machine is now down for 3 extra days and you ship late.  You lose the customer and go out of business.  Bitcoin fits the bill much better.  It's instant, free, and irrevocable.  The vendor gets the cash immediately and ships the materials to the airport.  You get your materials on time and everything is cool.  Disclosure:  I own a factory and I have Italian and German motors, encoders, and other gadgets that are too expensive to stock spares at my factory.  And they do break, because they are a little delicate.  If I have to wait 3 days to have the wire clear, I will lose my mind.  I also am not interested in paying international bank card fees for such large transactions.  Bitcoin would work much better and I will not hesitate to use them in this circumstance.

India may be the first worldwide casualty in fiat leak and a short timing attack.  It's a likely catalyst for much higher bitcoin prices.

India is in a pickle.  Consistently high inflation will result in fiat leaking into bitcoin.  Weaker fiat position opens the rupee to speculative short timing attacks.  The IMF can't help because they don't have bitcoins.  The only solution is higher interest rates, a recession, and an angered populace.  Well, they could stop the spending, but they won't.

Some of us will ease the suffering by donating bitcoin to the poor.  We will also invest the wealth in productive real assets like manufacturing in nations that legislate no capital gains taxes for bitcoin conversion to other asset classes.  These nations will experience an inflow of capital unlike anything that has ever happened.  Other nations will take a short term approach to protect their current fiat denominated system and experience destitution due to rapid outflow.

After reading your post, I feel the same way.  The US dollar is clearly more virtual than bitcoin.  But the USD is more widely accepted and the USD also has a more physical option in green paper, a handy advantage.  The acceptability dimension is moving forward, but we do not have a paper option.  Is it necessary to have a paper option?  I think no.  Even the most poor people I work with have smart phones and they use the guest networks when they can or they piggyback on a personal hotspot on a buddy's phone.  Proliferation of guest and decreasing data cost over time may eliminate the need for paper.

Exactly Mr. bullco. Here is an MBA translation:  The value of a bitcoin and any asset is its present value, which is calculated by predicting the future value and then discounting it back to the present using a risk-adjusted rate.  In bitcoin's case and in the market's opinion, the future value is extremely high, but the risk adjusted rate is also extremely high resulting in the current price.  Of course we believe that the risk is lower than that estimated by the market.  But you won't get to enjoy your riches.  A $100k coin could only occur during a highly devalued dollar causing massive economic destabilization.

No trusted third party to adjudicate disputes.  No p2p reputation integrated into bitcoin.  No way to prove identity.  These are the reasons banks exist.

Why do you care if insiders trade?  You sound totalitarian.  Insider cannot be stopped.  If you buy a security, you are at a disadvantage to insiders, regardless of what the law says.

That's what bitpay charges right?  Seems like a pricing problem to me.  These kinds of things usually come down to margin rate being high enough if fixed costs have been minimized.  And 200k is minimum for such a feat as this.

Ok, we will sell some and pay by check.

Bitcoin is a punishment.  Look and see.

Bitcoin is an investment, but also more.  So, it does not behave the same.  A new thing needs a new model.

Meanwhile, we use calculators.

Apple has delusions of controlling a one world currency and ruling the world.  So does Google.  So does the Federal Reserve.  So does Amazon.  Don't expect any cooperation.

Yes they do have to buy it.  They buy it as individuals, then they pass laws or impede lawmaking to make the price go up.  Then they buy influence, women, and cool stuff.

Cipher_gnome, please correct me.  We have a group doing paper wallets and we are not exactly sure how it works.  We were discussing today so I will tell them, too.  Let me know.
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:33:16
There is a market.

Governments don't run out of money, but instead issue more and more of it until the value of it becomes too small to use.  Then governments collapse.  Your question should be "what happens when the government collapses due to worthless money?"  I question if bitcoin use is even possible in that result.

India is near the top of the list for leakage/short attack.  Their currency is performing very poorly and their population is growing.  They still have women there.

So true.  They are there to make you look stupid.  That's what the readers want to see.

They remember the invasion.  Sticking it to their would be masters.

...and the most needed.  This is where fiat will transfer over.  Can't wait to watch this play.

Speculation is another good reason for you to have some bitcoin.  Besides being a good bet so far, speculators provide market liquidity.

We need those dollars to raise the value.  Legitamacy is won through hoarding.

His only option is to offers safe haven to attract the capital and the innovators.  He had better hurry.  All governments are considering it...

They have no choice but to jump onto the bitcoin train.  If they don't, their business will go up in smoke quick.  Western Union is a short-timer, too.

Wow.  Turning bitcoin into dollars and buying a house would be dangerous in the US.  Better not do that!  Probably much easier in a country that wants to a attract your capital, like Hong Kong for example.  Congratulations on your new house!

May I add that the technology will create value?

How would it work with SWIFT sending bitcoin?  I thought bitcoin replaces SWIFT.  For example, I sell product in China.  Customer in China currently sends me dollars using SWIFT system.  China customer switches to bitcoin upon our mutual agreement.  China sends bitcoin to my address instead.  I change to dollars if I need it for working capital.  If I don't, I leave it in bitcoin or send to shareholders as dividend.  I don't see why I need SWIFT at that point.

Why would I spend my precious bitcoin when I could use a credit or debit card denominated in fiat?   It is precious because it is mine, rising, and extremely liquid.
