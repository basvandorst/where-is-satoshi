While I think this system isn't going to work, I do see it as plausible.  While the surcharge of 4.4% is going to discourage rich people from saving, it will conversely encourage people to participate in mining.
If I understand the system right, rich people are going to be able to recoup lost value by mining, and since rich people have more money to throw at mining rigs, it stands to reason that rich people would be the major beneficiaries of the handout system.
Basically all it does is force rich people to participate in mining if they want to hold on to the value of their savings.
Unless they evenly distribute that surcharge to everyone, in which case the system isn't going to work at all because no one is going to want to use a currency that loses purchasing power over time.

I think what it teaches is simply not to trust other people with your money.
Before centralized banking, people had to actually look into the banks they were keeping their money with.  The bank might be issuing loans with their money to people who can't pay them back.  The bank might be issuing more receipts for gold (money) than they actually have in reserve.  The bank might have poor security and their money might be easily stolen.
Central banking makes it possible for people to ignore all of those issues because no matter what happens, the bank will be able to give them their money back.  Of course, along with the ability to give them their money back also comes all the economic destruction that is inherent in fractional reserve banking.
People have to learn how to do due diligence on their banking establishments all over again.  People aren't used to looking into the details of how their money is secured by a third party.  Our current monetary system has made them lazy.
As you suggest, this might be discouraging for people who are used to having everything handed to them on a silver platter, but in the end these issues are GOOD because they are weeding out the bad apples BEFORE Bitcoin goes super-nova in terms of the number of users using the currency.
Think of the destruction if Bitscalper had a million daily users.  It's better to have them weeded out now.

I have to wonder why Winder is so concerned about people buying drugs with their own money when private banks openly counterfeit billions on a daily basis.
In the end, all Winder is doing with his article is informing people how they can obtain drugs online without any real risk. So in a perverse way, Winder is actually promoting the currency.

I don't disagree with you, but the point is that legal tender laws WERE enacted.  So when I say in the article that "bank centralization could occur in much the same way it did under the gold standard if Bitcoins were not used directly in exchange" - I'm saying that Bitcoins could follow the same road as gold did toward being replaced by entirely fiat money.
The point I make in the article is that if payment systems were predicated on using Bitcoins directly, the state would have much more difficult time trying to ram legal tender down the public's collective throat.  Widespread use of bank notes is what facilitated legal tender fiat notes.  Imagine if everyone transacted with gold bullion instead of bank notes, then consider the problems this would create for the state.  If everyone is used to transacting in bullion, then one day the state comes along and says, "you people cannot use bullion as money any longer, you must use these paper tickets we printed," the people would riot.

This is not fractional reserve banking.  In order for fractional reserve banking to work, the Bitcoins have to be represented by receipts.
If the bank lends out the coins to someone else it can only do so if it uses a time deposit.  The use of a time deposit is 100% reserve banking.  Otherwise they will default rather quickly.  If a depositor should try to withdraw the coins after they have been lent to someone else, they will find nothing there to withdraw.  
Fractional reserve banking with Bitcoins is theoretically possible, but the market would prevent it from happening because no one would accept a "receipt" for a Bitcoin in a bank, they would demand real Bitcoins now.
@_date: 2012-03-09 18:20:48

@_date: 2012-03-09 00:46:00
The bank can lend out any amount because the central bank provides reserves on demand.  X will always be able to get his money because the bank can borrow the money necessary to ensure it can pay X.
In a free banking gold standard system without a central bank, the bank is counting on the fact that people will not redeem their notes for gold.  So it can always pay X and Y as long as people don't redeem its notes for gold.

@_date: 2012-03-10 16:54:51
Yeah I thought about that, but the thing is, you can't know how much the total deposits are at a given bank.
It might be possible to see how many coins a given bank has within the wallets it controls, but you can't tell what the total digital ledger deposit count is.  That is something only the bank would know.
Further, the bank might hold many different wallets, which would make it difficult to see exactly how many coins it is holding in the first place.
@_date: 2012-03-09 00:32:08
So if receipts or substitutes are not necessary, how would the bank balance its books?
You are correct that the bank can use digital account balances to mask the fraud, but that's still pure fraud.  It's not a fractional reserve system.
The bank's books would not balance if it counted all deposits as demand deposits yet lent out beyond its demand deposit balance. In order for the bank to balance its books, it could only lend out what it had in time deposits.

The biggest thefts in bitcoin had nothing whatsoever to do with bitcoin as a currency as well.  They had to do with improper network security on exchange or wallet servers.  
Saying "bitcoin" has problems because it can be stolen through hacking is the same as saying that the dollar has problems because it can be stolen by breaking and entering someone's home.  
People are mugged at gunpoint every day for dollars.  I doubt you will face the same problem if all you were carrying were Bitcoins in a digital wallet.  If you apply the same standards to the dollar as you do to bitcoins, you'll quickly see your arguments are patently ridiculous.

I think you are right.  I change my opinion on this matter.  It is the digital account balances at the bank that make this possible.  They act as the illegitimate on demand receipts that aren't backed by anything if the bank lends out its demand deposits.
I think the fact that its impossible for a central bank to backup the reserves of banks would keep this fraud limited in a Bitcoin system.  I guess we shall see in the future how the market deals with this possible fraud.

1.  Governments, working in collusion with commercial banks, worked to take us off the gold standard for their own gain.  Governments don't want a gold standard because it constrains their ability to print money, and banks don't like a gold standard because it prevents them from artificially driving down interest rates, which limits debt expansion.  Both banks and governments hate the gold standard, which is why we no longer have it. 
2.  That is preposterous.  The motivation for leaving the gold standard has nothing to do with labor wages and everything to do with a desire for expanded government power and bank profits.
@_date: 2012-05-16 23:41:52


Possible yes.
Further its usage?  no way.
Most people are not going to willingly invest in an inflationary currency.  The entire point of the currency is to prevent arbitrary inflation of the money supply.  
Further, with out the state using weapons to extract tax money, which it can then pump into an FDIC ponzi insurance racket, anyone banking at a Bitcoin fractional reserve bank would be nothing short of a moron.
The only thing that is preventing a bank run on every bank in existence is the fact that they are backed by the violent expropriation of tax money, which is then used to insure deposits through the Fed and FDIC ponzi rackets.  Every single bank in existence would be bankrupt if the state did not have guns backing them right now.
In short, the only way to get something for nothing is to take it by force.  Ponzi fractional reserve rackets are only made possible through the use of violence; otherwise they inherently collapse on their own.

Ask the people who kept their gold at banks before it was all confiscated why they kept their gold at the banks.
People do dumb shit for quick gains.  If a bank can offer services that seem too good to be true, people put their money there.  One of the incentives that crooked banks can offer is interest payments on demand deposits to entice people into banking with them.  They can also offer instant transfers between accounts and other institutions that agree to instant transfers with them.  Banks also offer added security from viruses, hackers, power surges, etc.. that might ruin a local wallet file.
If they can get enough people to keep their bitcoins with them and if they can get enough merchants to agree to ledger transfers instead of bitcoin transfers, then the banks and the state would be in a position to centralize bitcoin banking.

I suppose someone should explain why this is relevant.
If an entity was to attack the Bitcoin network, its greatest vulnerability would be for someone to gain a majority share of the network's processing capability, which would allow that entity to alter the network in such a way as to create chaos by reversing transactions and double spending coins.
Obviously this means that if a government wished to attack the network in order to destroy it, they would have to cough up some serious computing power beyond the capabilities of even the mightiest super computers in order to accomplish this feat.

In comparison to where Bitcoin started, it is preforming faaaaaaaaaaaaar above any other national currency.
Looking at the timeline since its inception compared to any other currency  in existence, it is up by a massive margin.
Just because it has lost a lot of value from its all time high does not mean it still isn't wildly higher than where it was just a year ago.
The number of MERCHANTS accepting Bitcoin is continually growing - not shrinking.  As the number of merchants accepting coins grows, the number of people willing to use it will grow, and hence its value will grow as more dollars are pumped into the bitcoin economy over time.
What happens over the short term with bitcoin dollar values is inconsequential to its expanding presence in the market place.

I know this, but you missed out on my primary bank account which is held on my local PC.
The accounts you mentioned are my public accounts I use for transferring donations from my website.  Once I get them into mt. Gox, the coin tumbling of Gox makes them disappear.
My public name is also a pseudonym, but I suppose it wouldn't be too difficult to track the real me down if you were a State.  But clearly knowing who I am and knowing my public donation accounts is quite different than knowing what my primary hidden bank account contains.
Anyone running a professional business that wanted to keep their assets hidden would simply have to use an automated POS system that generates new addresses for each transaction and then move their earnings through a coin tumbler.  All of that would be automated by any decent POS system.
But lets say you manage to track down my private local account, how do you know I don't have multiple local wallets stored off line at various locations?  Perhaps I have an encrypted wallet file off site and backed up to my gmail account?  Perhaps I have it on a thumb drive hidden in my wall?
hmmm.....  there's just no way to know.

This is the same kind of fictitious problem put forth by Keynesians when they argue that the market produces natural monopolies.
Consider that since there is no entry barrier preventing multiple unscrupulous individuals from engaging the same behavior, we can be assured that competition between all unscrupulous individuals would prevent any one of them from obtaining &gt;50% of the market share.
Since all unscrupulous individuals know this ahead of time, they would not even bother to engage in that behavior given the risk/cost of having to compete against other unscrupulous individuals.
Free markets do not allow monopolies to come into existence.  In order for the above scenario to play out, a State would have to impose a monopoly on mining through the use of violent force, which in the case of bitcoin, would be impossible given that it is a global currency system.

Yeah, but clearly any commodity that meets the function of money, such as gold, would be superior to a money that is artificially inflated. Gold, silver, platinum, etc.. would all be superior to anything that can simply be run off a printing press. 
And further, if we consider representative paper currencies, ANY commodity would be superior one that is printed off a printing press.  Consider your initial claim of oil futures - if they could be traded as a paper representation of oil, then why wouldn't they be superior to a money that is simply run off a press ad-infinitum?
Clearly an oil backed dollar would be superior to one that is arbitrarily inflated.

Wild exchange rates do not a bad currency make.  Gold also has some wild exchange rates, but over all, gold retains a constant value in comparison to all other goods and services.
The market is capable of rapidly adjusting to swings in exchange rates, and futures contracts can mitigate such swings even further.
We can say with total confidence that Bitcoin, over the long term, will be a good investment simply because we know that the number of people willing to transact in Bitcoins for goods and services is expanding, and will continue to expand.
The logic is simple.  People generally prefer to do business in a currency that can not be debased.

Consider that savings is how interest rates are naturally lowered.  If people are saving a lot, bank reserves expand, which leads to banks naturally lowering rates on their own.
Today, interest rates are low strictly because of the Fed printing money.  If there are no savings, then there are no real resources available for producers to use.  Savings represent REAL things that are put aside for use in future production.  If money is arbitrarily printed, it does not represent any real saved resources.
Savings are what produce a strong economic foundation.  Capital resources must be conserved in order to build projects into the future without running out of resources.

Only the government is capable of creating a monopoly (see patents) because it requires the use of force to mitigate the advantages of cheating the cartel.
For example, if all unscrupulous individuals agree to cooperate, they could in theory achieve their goal of &gt;50% domination, but since the incentive to cheat the cartel is massive and the fact that there is no barrier to entry for new participants, the cartel will inevitably be undermined.
No cartel can sustain itself without the aid of violent government intervention.  If cartels could sustain themselves without such aid, the Federal Reserve would be unnecessary.  Consider that all banks could collude to set interest rates and agree to evenly inflate the money supply on their own, but the massive incentives to cheat this system always undermine any cartel that attempts to form itself.  Thus, a government regulatory institution is necessary to make this possible through the use of violent force.

Not really a law, it is more a "common law" that says people can freely engage in barter and the State has no right to prevent them from doing so.
However, that does not apply today because private property no longer exists in the world.  
For example, in order to engage in commerce, one must first get permission by way of licenses from a bureaucracy.  Further, one must pay rents on all properties to the State by way of taxes.  So there really is no true private property that exists today anywhere in the world.

Bitcoin is as safe as you want it to be.  I could have 500,000 in gold stolen by someone breaking into my safe.  I could have 500,000 from my bank account stolen by someone figuring out the password to my bank account.  And you most certainly can press charges if someone steals money from your Bitcoin accounts.
And there is an actual economy behind the Bitcoin price.  To suggest otherwise is ridiculous.  There is no central bank managing the money supply or interest rates with Bitcoins, unlike our fraudulent fiat dollar system.  The prices of Bitcoins are determined entirely by market forces.

No, because people don't buy bitcoins (ascribe them a dollar value) because the network that powers them could possibly have alternative uses.
Now if the network was put to an alternative use, then people might value the network (not the coins), but I'm not sure how people would go about "buying" the network since there is nothing to buy.

People in other countries also need to buy oil.  All oil is priced in dollars.  
Further, people in other countries agreed to use the dollar as the international yard stick against which all other currencies were measured in order to facilitate international trade.  The decision by those governments to use the dollar as the international reserve currency took place when the dollar was tied to gold.
In essence, they only agreed to such an arrangement because the dollar was literally as good as gold.
Today we see china hoarding gold as it prepares to push the dollar out of the international reserve currency position:

Models are not real computers. But it would seem to me that the first use of quantum computers would be to generate a more secure algo.
If that does indeed happen, then a competing currency would be created.  Competition is what makes markets work, and competition in currencies is normal healthy thing to have.
Consider that if a merchant has set themselves up to transact in bitcoins, adding an additional electronic currency to their retail store front should be a fairly trivial matter.
Customers would have a choice of electronic currency options at checkout, using the preferred currency of their choosing.

I think this reader *vastly* underestimates how worse off the middle class are today compared to where they would be if the State was eliminated.
One income in the 1960s was capable of buying a home, putting the kids through school, and retiring. 
Today, two incomes doesn't even cut it - and forget about retiring with a nice pension unless you are a government worker.
So rather than focusing on the poor, who managed to get along just fine without dropping dead of starvation, I think you should be focusing on the middle class which is rapidly getting wiped out.

The fact that Bitcoin is a network, along with being a client, is irrelevant to the discussion of how bitcoin pricing arises.

Let me prove to you that when people want to avoid the law with bitcoin, they have absolutely no problems doing so.
Question:  What do you suppose is the largest market for Bitcoin transactions today?  Illicit drug purchases?  At least that's what I would say. 
We know with total certainty that a large portion of Bitcoin's value comes from black market uses, yet how many times have you heard of a Silk Road user getting arrested because the police tracked them down through their Bitcoin transactions?
I've never heard of it.  And even if there are a few cases of this happening, its clearly far to difficult for the authorities to accomplish on any regular basis, as would be required for them to impose taxation.
Thus we can say with total certainty that when people want to avoid problems with the law, they have no problems doing so.  Obviously if I was going to make black market purchases or sales, I would make sure none of my "public" money ever co-mingled with my private money.  If people faced the threat of theft by government, clearly they would take the same steps the Silk Road users do today to ensure their privacy.
If a bunch of stoners can launder their bitcoins effectively, I have no doubts that savvy businessmen would be ten times harder to track down.

Bitcoin is not private money in the sense that the code and its associated network are owned by any one individual or group of individuals.  It is private money in the sense that governments can't loot it.
Historically, money is considered private if it is minted by a private mint and used among the general public through voluntary trade.  Because historically money has been gold, and the gold typically came from private mines, privately minted gold coins could be considered private money in the true sense of the word.
I suppose one could consider Bitcoin private in that it comes into existence through a mining process and is retained originally by private individuals.  However, the network itself is no more private than unclaimed gold on unclaimed land is considered to be private.  Anyone may homestead that gold and claim it for themselves, but until that happens, the gold is not considered private.  It is simply considered to be an unclaimed resource.

Of course I can.
Clearly the USD is more established and widely accepted than other currencies.  Further, oil is internationally priced in dollars.  So if people want oil, they will eventually need to buy dollars to make such purchases.  Also the dollar is presently the international reserve currency.
Of course it is entirely rational for people to willingly use the USD as a means of exchange in such situations.  However, I'm not attacking the use of the dollar as a means of exchange in my article.  I'm saying that Krugman's analysis of Bitcoins is completely flawed and illogical.  There is a world of difference.

It would validate Bitcoins as a superior currency and it would leave China with less control over its own currency.
Governments buying Bitcoins would be the biggest boon for the currency it could ever hope to accomplish.  Eventually the currency itself would destroy the governments buying it because they would lose control over the ability to inflate the money supply and they would lose control over the ability to effectively tax the currency.
It would also drive the value of the currency into the stratosphere.
@_date: 2011-12-16 19:57:23
You are making some pretty grandiose assertions there without any logic to back them up.
Why would a government currency be more stable?  Clearly fiat monies controlled by governments are inherently unstable. 
Why would a government issue a crypto-currency at all when such systems make it ten times harder for government to track transactions and tax them?
Why would a government stop at controlling just the initial coins?  Historically speaking, once governments get control of the printing press they never stop printing.
Governments make currencies less stable, they do not add stability.

The money has to get seeded somehow, and the best mechanism to do that is through miners who sell the digital commodity on the open market.
The ideal situation though is to not have any inflation of money supply at all once that task of seeding the currency has been accomplished.
Further, the type of inflation the Keynesians laud is tied to an exponential interest metric.  Consider the difference between increasing the money supply by 2% per year or increasing it by a fixed number, such as mining accomplishes.
Eventually the increase in money per-year from mining at a fixed rate would have a negligible impact on prices because the percentage of total money in circulation that it accounts for would become less and less over time.

A few concepts for Mr. Yoo's consideration:
Add a method of payment selector so people can easily sort by acceptable payment methods.  Some people might want to use this service to buy bitcoins by sending cash in the mail, while others may want to use instant services like PayPal, while still others may only want to take wire transfers.  I know you have a text field for this, but it might be nice to also have a sortable type selector for open orders.
Add price charting metrics with clickable chart points for open orders.  It should be possible to create a moving average, along with highest and lowest offers, based off of open orders.  It should also be possible to create a chart that shows a bid/ask spread.

The 'money scarcity' issue is an absurdity with an electronic medium of exchange. 
You can run into scarcity issues with physical specie, but it's impossible to run into scarcity issues with a currency that can be infinitely divided.
Deflation simply means people are saving resources rather than spending them, which is exactly what needs to happen in order for economic expansion to occur.  Saved resources can then be pooled into long term projects, rather than be immediately consumed.
Deflation is a redistribution of resources back into the hands of prudent investors and savers.  The people who invested early in Bitcoin will control the most resources because of its deflation.  Those are PRECISELY the people who SHOULD control the most resources, because they are the most likely people to put them to use responsibly.

Small private banks may not be afraid, but the big commercial banks certainly are.
You can't bailout banks under a bitcoin system.  You need tax money and fiat money creation through bonds to do that.
ALL of those major banks are technically insolvent given their reserves.  Any time a bank issues a loan that comes from "on call" deposits they are committing fraud.  While this is not legally called fraud, that's what it amounts to.  A bank run on deposits could occur at ANY TIME.  The only reason it doesn't today is because we have the FDIC and bailouts.  Under a bitcoin system, there would be no such thing as the FDIC.  
Do you honestly think the major banks would EVER want to see Bitcoin become the dominate currency?  You must be on another planet.
