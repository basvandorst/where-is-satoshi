So what? It's more about bitcoin than any merchant accepting bitcoin because if they succeed they will make new applications for cryptocurrencies.

Let's respect privacy of people. You think that Dorian Nakamoto case was good for him? You don't have to promote bitcoin. If people will find bitcoin useful they will use it. Or maybe you just want to drive price up?

Use blockchain info API for sending and receiving bitcoins.

Where is working proof of concept?

I could do this. If somebody have MicroView i can buy it from them or I will wait till Kickstarter will ship it to me.

Coin acceptor ~20$
Arduino UNO clone ~10$
Raspberry Pi ~ 35$ 
Various electric elements ~ 10$
Enclosure ~ from another device essentially free.
I have to make new enclosure so i could not tell you total cost.

And all funds were given back.

Text: I bought tons of bitcoins back when they were a few cents each. I can afford to do this forever.

Just make a valid bitcoin address with valid checksum.
Example: 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSend + checksum f59kuE 
Check how bitcoin addresses are created.

I saw you commented. Reddit could be replaced by a simple contract. Vitalik meme begin!

This is obvious scam. Do not invest money!

Xapo is probably a wapourware. Mastercard said that they have no affiliaton with Xapo. And after gaining buzz on media they will not ship any product.

What if ghash.io will block this transaction? 
@_date: 2014-10-25 20:19:47
What about support for PLN?

I made cheap ATM from standard coin acceptor with Raspberry Pi and Arduino. I could make even two way bitcoin atms if i make a good and secure metal case for electronics. Even Skyhook ATM with price point $1000 is too expensive. Is my project worth working at?

Maybe try to give remaining 50% to people which tipped post earlier to give some incentive to looking up for good content? 
@_date: 2014-07-05 19:23:41
Ok, I bought all hardware and I will be trying to make secure, cheap and intuitive hardware wallet. You will be me first client? 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:49:31
Let's stop talk about Xapo until they ship first card and somebody could write a review.

There is bitcoin hackathon in Warsaw, Poland( There is few people that actually fully understand how bitcoin transactions works in detail. Using blockchain API or similar is not  quite different from any other API so you don't need bitcoin bootcamps just regular programming bootcamps and maybe one session how into bitcoins.

Only coin bitcoin point of sale will be cheap like ~200$ and i could make large quantity of these. Nice idea - thank you!
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:32:01
Why? Is this irony or something?
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:27:14
There should be nothing but monetary incentives to do anything or you could just pray and beg. There is only one power. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:59:54
I got it too. No Xapo logo present. No information from Xapo
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:12:27
What about making generic card system that will support bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:48:43
Stop using Coinbase if you don't want to be goxed people!

What about adding some verification/reputation system on top like  - you can use EIP725 with EIP735 claims for free, and embrace open standard
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:06:02
Could you give some example client implementation? 
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:42:14
Thank you very much. Could you make clear on thing about BitcoinLendingClub? If there is a loan composed from investments (5%-10% per annum) - each investor is paid exactly the same average rate or rate they had chosen?  Investing in auction is more profitable at beginning or ending? How to determine when loan will be activated? (money on not activated loans is not working so it is time wasted)

I have public beta for p2p loans in bitcoin. Facebook login required.  [bitcoin p2p lending!](	
There are few challenges:
1. Default risk
2. Bitcoin price change risk (bad for entrepreneurs that don't earn bitcoins and changing price could be bad for them )
3. You need to offer low interest rate to gain quality borrowers. Only desperate people would go for loan with very high APR and it makes default rates worse. 
4. Bitcoin is still wild west in terms of finance regulation. The same apply for bitcoin equity crowdfunding and p2p lending.
And somehow there are more and more services that will rebuild finance world with crypto/smart money and i am proud that i could offer something to community.

Higher spread and they are slower. cap theorem means that you cannot have all of this in same time:
Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time)
Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it succeeded or failed)
Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system)
