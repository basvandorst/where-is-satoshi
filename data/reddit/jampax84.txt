We also all live in houses or apartments "for now" and eat at Macdonalds "for now".

Well that would be flawed statistics, if you are suggesting that the 1/6th who have self selected or because of geographic and cultural reasons to use facebook are dumber than the other 5/6.
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:39:30
Yes, they are stupid. The ones with the platform used by 1/6th of humanity.
@_date: 2014-05-19 13:38:19
How is that even relevant or a normal thing to say.
These guys seem like hype-machines who enjoy being the loudest voice in the room.

Its far more groundbreaking, the worlds largest repository of photographs, ever, lightning fast anywhere in the world. With 1 billion users. To be frank it works 100x better and is more useful for the average human being too.
@_date: 2014-11-12 09:41:06
Why is that good?
Don't you want real people to start using it for real business transactions rather than hedge funds speculating on it as a commodity.
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:30:53
Facebook already has changed the world. 
It is something new, there has never been a repository for so much human data and content, there also has never been a photo library as big, ever. 
Bitcoin is hard to use, hardly adopted by anyone in comparison and looks unlikely to be used by the general public in its current form.

But the point is - when the internet first started, it was it's utility that drove massive adoption. Not speculation - people didnt buy internets and sit on them hoping to get rid of them in a few years to get their dollars back.
It was a protocol that was inherently massively useful - that's the reason why bitcoin will work long terms surely, but it seems that most people are talking about its USD value and how they are holding for long term etc. That sounds like an asset not something with utility that is going viral and expanding - if most people are jumping into bitcoin because of the USD appreciation then I think thats a problem. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 14:19:00
Well yes it's not exactly the same, but the chatter and hype around bitcoin is mostly around the $USD gains you can make and the price of it against fiat currencies.
I don't see how it can be come successful without adoption and use as an actual currency, all the people saying how great it is and so much better than fiat, at the same time seem to be unusually concerned with its USD price. I.e. hoping to make USD Fiat gains, not use bitcoin as something valuable in itself.

Yeah that is a good point. But from personal experience, NFC isn't irrelevant and is definitely an improvement on pin entry with a card.

From experience, my fiat is safe in my bank account. Everyone I know has never had any issues with fiat disappearing due to how the current financial dynamic works. You can use it for anything and its value doesnt change 20% in one day.
Bitcoin is really cool, I hope it catches on and is developed into something much slicker, stable and easy to use for the masses. But its currently not safer than fiat.

I like Bitcoin and hoping it continues to grow.
But she has a point, bitcoin isn't as safe (currently) as Euros in your bank account. 
If the bank collapses (in Europe) the government guarantee up to £35,000 in the UK. If mtgox collapses - you get nothing.
The Euro and USD fluctuate very small amounts daily - Bitcoin goes up or down by 20%. 
So yes, Bitcoin is cool and we're all rooting for it but fiat is safer - blindly saying the bitcoin is 100% better than USD or EUR in its current state just isnt true.

Is there any info on who Satoshi is speculated to be?
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:40:17
It is somewhat stupid to compare a company with bitcoin and argue over which is "best". 
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:47:05
Everyone here is still talking about it as an asset, with the only goal apparently to make gains in USD on their holdings of bitcoin.
Shouldn't the focus be on turning it into a means of exchange - we should be hoping for price stability rather than more big gains and new "investors".

Alexa is unreliable and inaccurate.
Try Similarweb.com or quantcast.com, although they won't have much data for Chinese netizens. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:40:31
No it isn't, if you truly believe that then you have no idea how an average person uses the internet.

Sorry but NFC tap to pay is so much easier.
Pin payment goes like this:
1. Insert card
2. Wait 2-6 seconds
3. Tap pin
4. Wait 2-8 seconds
5. Receipt starts printing
6. Wait to remove card
NFC tap to pay :
1. Tap card
2. Wait 2 seconds
So when he says "how is it making life better?" - he can't have a very good feel for what is easier for consumers if he thinks pin payment is easier than NFC.
