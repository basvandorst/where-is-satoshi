Without going into specifics of my experience, your stats seem very off. As another person who replied to you indicates, the risk of developing a poor reputation is enough for vendors NOT to scam paying customers. Buyers have no reputation on these marketplaces and therefore FE is mostly an appropriate way of mitigating the risk of buyers stealing product.
