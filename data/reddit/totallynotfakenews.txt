Very cool. I love that with all the tea leaves and crystal balls of TA people put in the time to come up with something really unique like this. As much as people talk about S/F this makes a compelling case as to how Bitcoin is converging toward a S/F model and an actual Target price (14-20K) for the next halving to confirm S/F convergence. If we go through May 2020 between 14 and 20K I'll be psyched.
@_date: 2019-11-10 02:44:05
For clarity, I'm not a TA hater. My larger point was that I found OP's analysis (I don't know if it was his OC, I think it is) to be superior to TA I've seen in that, it doesn't just assume that a certain model, S/F in this case, applies to Bitcoin. Instead the analysis shows how strongly it's correlated with Bitcoin and what we would expect to see if that correlation continues and strengthens. TA gets a bad reputation in BTC because people take known models from other assets that don't seem to apply to Bitcoin (not yet at least) and shoehorn them in. 
I've been hearing for months "because of S/F we expect 100K 12 months after the halving." Great, but this analysis is so much more interesting because it shows how much S/F actually applies to Bitcoin. If TA can produce more of that I'm all for it.

Yeah, I think they take a lot more into account than just sentiment. Trading volume, volatility, etc. Not just what people are saying but how people are trading. But agreed, it's not always what you'd expect at any given time. It seems best used if you're looking at a 3 month timeline.

Yep. If price drops and it's costing too much to mine difficulty adjusts and mining requires less resources and remains profitable. (Almost like someone smart planned for these things.)

Good insight, I guess that's one strange part about investing in bitcoin. When people see the price at 3K, 4K, 10K, it strangely drives their idea for how much money they should invest, like "What's the point of investing if I don't own full bitcoins?"
I will admit that during the run from like 10K to 13K I was thinking, "well, better mortgage the house." laziness prevailed.
While I'm glad that I'm not in that position I do feel bad for people that put in everything when it was at 19K. Like you said that's life-changing money and in previous crashes that wasn't the case.
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:33:35
Discussion question for old timers: Is the rhetoric and general feeling the same during this "crash" as previous "crashes?" 
I feel just fine about the price. I started about a year ago and on average am up in that time period more than any other investment that I would have considered, even though I bought some well above 10K. We have a lot of statements made about "this crash is different than the last" or "this crash is the same as the last." I'm curious if the general mood and vitriol on both sides was similar during previous crashes?

In a sense they do. Let's say a BIP for some future Improvement, let's call it "Quantum Wallets," is proposed and it appears to improve network security/agility, much like segwit did. Miners will evaluate the proposal and signal support and at some point only process blocks that included "Quantum Wallet" support. Ultimately miners want Bitcoin to be secure and mining to be profitable so the smart ones (the majority) will signal support and continue mining. The weak-minded ones (the minority) will get salty and wait for a charismatic leader to pull their mining resources away and mine on a side chain which naturally becomes super centralized, we'll call this side chain BitCash. Rather than use creative solutions to the Quantum security problem BitCash will request that users each generate 1 wallet per Satoshi to make Quantum cracking unprofitable and claim that, while inconvenient and inefficient, it preserves Satoshi's original vision. Hypothetical of course.

Ignoring the larger point and using the opportunity to dispense some sound financial advice. Credit Card rewards are designed to make it less painful to spend money. Even if you never pay a penny in interest you are subconsciously saying "let's spend a little more than we normally would because we'll get some cash back/airline miles/Amazon gift cards." Spending money should always be painful or uncomfortable at least. Credit Card rewards will never change your life for the better, it will just make spending less painful. Saving that money and investing in some interest-gaining asset (be it Bitcoin, gold, stocks, or real estate) will change your life.

@_date: 2019-12-02 03:47:24
Yes, that's the idea. Companies and the economy at large would much rather see you part with your money than have you use it to build wealth. As long as they can make it less painful for you to spend most people are fine parting with their money and missing out on potential interest-bearing investments. It's a mindset that most of us accept. Meanwhile those organizations use our money to do what we didn't have the foresight to do; invest it. Ironically they do that by lending our money back to us for mortgages and car loans. It's really a great idea for them.
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:56:51
It's just kind of a truism in personal finance, a rewording of "A penny saved is a penny earned." But Dave Ramsay talks about it sometimes if you're expecting an authority or something. Rather than saying it should be painful maybe it's more accurate to say spending money should be well-considered. If you're looking to buy a pair of headphones and you're torn between a $30 pair and a $70 pair which you know will provide the same utility CC rewards help give the extra push to the $70 pair because you think "yeah, it's more, but I'll get that much more cash back." Believe it or not CC companies are just fine with the users that never pay interest because they even get paid when you swipe. One way or another their job is simply to push you to swipe as often as possible and make it as fun/painless as possible.

Ledger Nano S meets most people's needs. X has the advantage of Bluetooth which means you can easily connect it to your phone. Most people don't manage big Bitcoin transactions on their phone, so, while cool, it's not really that helpful IMHO. 
Ledger Nano for your big savings. Then keep a small amount in a mobile wallet for purchases, transfers to friends.etc. That way you enjoy very high security for your savings and convenience with pretty high security for your spending money.

You've received good answers so I won't be redundant. But regarding your question 1+2 an interesting topic for you to look into is the difficulty adjustment that occurs every 2016 blocks (about 2 weeks) on the network. It helps understand how the protocol deals with demand change.
And whoever Satoshi was and whatever his motives were can't change that he pulled some of the best concepts together to create a killer protocol. Anyone can participate now and verify it does what it claims. If it did/does make him Jeff Bezos rich it would be just as deserved as any of the other billionaires in the world.

2 things 
1. Your timeline is very short. Every fiat currency ever created has failed or is demonstrably in the process of failing due to devaluation. Is Bitcoin volatile? No doubt! But in it's 10 years (a very short timeline) it has withstood tremendous pressure of many different types and has still come from a joke to a world-class asset, albeit still with much skepticism around it from traditional institutions.
2. You're comparing to the USD which is one of the slower failing fiat currencies. If you compare against the Argentine peso or Venezuelan Bolivar you'll have a harder time finding a losing change of hands. There is nothing special about the USD that will prevent that level of inflation and if it doesn't eventually fail it will be going against the centuries-long trend.
@_date: 2019-12-27 20:12:37
In my non-combative opinion this question comes from Cash Coin mentality. Bitcoin's use case is to remove the ability from nation states to create money and use that money to bail out banks or other institutions. The peer-to-peer currency aspect is a necessary part of accomplishing that goal; you have to let anybody transact no matter what their political or national status. You also have to decentralize so that no one nation can shut it down. Bitcoin will naturally share aspects of other means of transactions and even possibly be worse than other services in some ways. But first and foremost the goal is to remain decentralized, unhackable, and deflationary.
@_date: 2019-12-04 05:03:37
Crap, Bitcoin is dead! If only the protocol were structured in such a way that consensus-driven improvements could be made to the network as new threats or challenges arise...If I had my way I would have allowed open source Bitcoin Improvement Proposals to allow users to suggest improvements.

This doesn't line up with what we see in chaos situations. Internet connections seem to be more hardened against failure than banking institutions or even national currencies. Could they fail? Sure.

Paper Wallets were great as a learning tool. They have no real use anymore, there are much better wallets.
Regarding your question a paper wallet will always allow you to access your Bitcoin, BUT, if it was generated in an insecure manner (nearly impossible to securely generate a paper wallet) many others could also access your Bitcoin.
A simple and reasonably secure compromise is to use a mobile wallet which generates a recovery seed, these are generally called BIP39 wallets. I use mycellium (people here are going to hate on me...), but there are a lot of good wallets out there. 
For larger quantities consider a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano which are physical devices, resembling a flash drive, which store your private key(s) in a manner that can't be accessed by the computer the device is plugged into. In other words you can be using a super compromised computer with people spying on you, but without possession of the device no one can make transactions from your wallet. I think most here would say that A hardware wallet with Electrum (which is wallet software for PC) is quite secure.
Putting weath into Bitcoin can be sketchy, but if you're determined to do it research and discipline will eventually provide you immense confidence.

Yeah. People always ask me "what will you do if the US outlaws the use of Bitcoin?" The answer is I'll move somewhere that didn't outlaw it.

If they don't become a leader in Bitcoin adoption it will be a sign of much worse things to come.
@_date: 2019-12-01 20:00:02
I think that's a very popular opinion. Most people don't expect the halving to have any real price effect. It is generally expected that price increases will happen around 6 months later. That is based on the behavior seen in previous halvings. Obligatory "past performance does not predict future activity." But if anything will change it will be well after the halving.

I see people not wanting to spend Bitcoin as a good sign. It's already proven that Bitcoin can be used as a currency. This ability is being greatly enhanced with Lightning Network (which the Bitcoin community does talk a lot about). 
What needs to be proven now is that Bitcoin is sound money. There is an idea in Economics called Gresham's law which basically means that people will spend their worst money first. If you want to buy a car and the seller will accept 4oz gold or 340oz silver, and then makes the strange stipulation that they saw 8 metric tons of dirt in your yard that they will also take as payment, you're likely going to unload the dirt first, knowing that it's the worst form of money among those 3. But if you can only choose between gold and silver, you're likely going to unload your silver as you probably consider it a worse form of money than the gold.
In more practical terms it seems that when poeple have the choice between spending their Bitcoin and their USD (or other fiat currency) they are choosing to spend the USD. "Increase adoption by spending", "spend and replace" and other similar ideas are at odds with Gresham's law. I take it as a good sign that people are mroe willing to part with their fiat.
All that being said it's probably wishful thinking, the lack of spending is probably best explained by hopeful hodlers.

Don't know about Cash App. What you're describing about Coinbase is standard though. You can buy instantly on Coinbase only with some pretty crazy fees. Or you can wait about 7-10 days to transfer to Coinbase pro and but with much lower fees.
