For stocks maybe. Crypto is 24 hours? There will definitely be a spread and that's how they'll make their money.

You know it's not really zero fee right? It's built into the price i.e. bid/ask spread, similar to when you go to a bank to exchange one fiat to another.

Quality shitpost. Take the damn upvote.

What does Putin think though? Everything else is moot.

I find it odd that at the bottom such an article there's a referral link to trade crypto.

Great news, but it's not free. Fee is built into the price as spread i.e. it's the illusion of being free.

Bitcoin is. Coinbase is not.
It's the customers who abandoned "bitcoin principles" as you call it, by giving up their private keys and entrusting their coins to a central authority in the first place. Coinbase never pretended to champion those beliefs. If you read their terms of service, you'd know they never adhered to any of those principles from day one.

What hotel/taxi reform? It's just healthy competition at best. They will adapt. And what finance reform was caused by Bitcoin? It doesn't even provide competition at this point.

Yes they do.

I think innovation will outpace data size i.e. drives will get bigger/faster, internet will get faster.

It’s a joke. Learn to take it. I couldn’t care less about your project.

Not to my knowledge. I hope others follow.

Because bank have never knowingly sold dodgy or fraudulent financial products to clients?

Not sure why everyone is getting so excited... What happened to owning your own keys, being your own bank, decentralization, etc.

Convenience, laziness? Why're are people still using windows?

Unfortunately, you are a minority. When it comes to money, people can be (are) awful.

It’s like people completely forgot the last month or so... **THERE ARE NO EXPERTS!!!**

It's not possible, because I will literally sell everything I own to buy if &lt; $1 as I'm sure many others will.

Those are financial products securitized (essentially packaged/created) by JPM and then sold to investors without what was deemed to be "sufficient" risk disclosures. BTC is different. JPM Is merely a middleman. If the client is requesting/demanding the transaction, a simple waiver signing would suffice.

I presume due to the increased volatility and uncertainty
