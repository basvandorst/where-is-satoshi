People choose paytm over bitcoin because, paytm allows to pay utility bills and support many other online shopping sites like Amazon, flipkart etc. We will need more bitcoin payment processors!

Note, bitcoin is ready but people aren't due to lack of understanding

This is really good :) although I had 1 question, for a transaction which has been done a long time ago and is embedded deep in a blockchain, does the bitcoin software takes too much time to trace back and get the coinbase information?
@_date: 2016-11-17 14:45:56
It is highly unlikely that exchanges such as circle are needed once mass adopted

Can u also help us visualise what signing a transaction means?
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:15:50
Good point, I believe your wallet software checks for coinbase first before initiating a transaction.. not sure but experts can comment.
