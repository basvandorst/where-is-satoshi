Yeah, this is really just a case of user error. You can load multiple 2FA’s into Google.

I think you've misconstrued my point. Take kids for example. They don't know what's socially acceptable to talk about, and what's not, so they inquire about anything and everything. I mean, how else does one learn if they don't ask the uncomfortable questions?
As we get older, (and by we, I mostly mean the poor), we get conditioned to avoid topics like money because the poor don't have a lot, and therefore it's an uncomfortable topic to discuss. However, ignorance doesn't teach good lessons; just like teaching abstinence doesn't educate people on safe / proper sex.
My original point is that we as a society should be able to ask all the hard questions regardless of whether they're polite or not. You won't learn to be a better person financially, or in whatever areas you seek to self-improve if you don't have someone more knowledgeable, or someone who's made more mistakes to steer you away from the poor choices.
I'm not sure what tangent you went off on, but it's not where I was going with my original comment.

The “fake it till you make it” outlook? ��

Yep. The rich talk about money and wealth all the time, and that’s how they get richer. Put your focus on it, and get more of it.

I feel like it’s this kind of mentality that keeps the general population down. Nobody gets to the top by being kind.

Right... cause centralized banks are rule followers and not shady at all.

Hindsight is always 20/20... ��
What would you be saying if it kept going down?

Well, I missed out on the most recent dip cause I set my limit price low, but I have faith it will go down again at some point. Time will tell if I’m right. ��
