Sell once futures go live - Wall Street's about to short them HARD to buy significant amounts of coins for (metaphorical) pennies; buy in again when you see the climb, etc.

fuck man, really sorry to hear this, must be devastating. But at the same time, you can think of those moments where people bought a lottery ticket and just *barely* missed out on riches. Got one ticket too early or were one number off, etc. Instead of accounting that you lost your money, might make more sense here to just realize you may not have had it at all to begin with in another world.

Could be celebrating and then...opposite-of-celebrating?...like every 10 minutes the way today's been going

Same. Was really hoping for a touch-and-run on 5900 but broke *wayyy* last that unfortunately ����

Quality comment. Def overinvested but good to get this POV in a clear and matter-of-fact manner haha

I've been having some shaky hands during this 7200-7900 range...don't know when to sell!

I understand the author's bullish view on the tech and use of Bitcoin (even if a big piece of their $100k valuation is predicated on offshore accounts / tax avoidance uses of bitcoin...which I doubt will happen given this 'currency's volatility). But this step-by-step addition to a $100k valuation is way too methodical and I think idealistic in an *extremely* sentiment-driven market.

Yeah, I can afford to lose what I put in but it's still been a devastating drop. Was okay with like 25-30% corrections even from $14-15k but this is nuts!

Bitcoin has been nothing *but* pump and dump and...whatever the opposite of pump and dump is. Just have to try your best to get some returns while that's happening

We blasted through that wall like the fuckin Kool-Aid man

In the same boat here...damn psychology always driving me to a full coin vs something way more digestible haha
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:20:15
Can afford to lose this much, sure, but it's making me sick to my stomach...how are you guys planning to recoup losses? LOL

It's because people are more worried by negative news than they are encouraged by positive news. Given 10 great headlines and 2 negative ones, people will get hooked on the downsides and pessimistic sentiment will get boosted.

well it's at $6200 and dropping now...

Yeah this is pretty much my situation. But isn't it everyone's
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:33:19
Pretty sure I just saw 7750, blinked, rubbed my eyes, and opened them to 7915.
