I don’t know why but since I woke up this morning 8am GMT+1 I had the feeling that today is a turning point and that we will go up, maybe even reach a new ATH soon. Just feeling very positive with everything that’s going on atm despite the decline the last few days. 
Can’t really explain it rationally though. Maybe it was seeing a big Bitcoin logo on BBC business news at breakfast this morning connected to Kodak

Haha oh well. Unfortunately you were wrong as well. Up and down we go...

How exactly is volume correlated with the price?
As the volume is quite low during this current drop, how is it possible that the price is effected so strongly?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:07:47
Obviously I know that I don’t predict the future or that my feelings are special and can predict future prices (I would have invested a lot more a lot earlier).
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:21:09
Yeah, same here. Bought quite a lot at 16k. After that freakish ride down to 11k I see everything quite relaxed now. Watch parabolic Trav’s Videos on YouTube.

Unfolding of downtrend?
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:18:52
Bitcoin is quite oversold right now.
RSI is almost at 30. Every time it has been below 30 it had a massive bounce back up.
It will probably be the same again but with a higher bottom. Last time Bitcoin hit 30 was in the mid 6k range.
What I hope is that the bounce up passes 10k.

I see, if you can afford it, i would not sell at this price.
Do you still have access to your bank account? Sorry, I’m not a native English speaker and not a 100% sure if depleted means that your access was blocked.
If you still have access and need the fiat right now, transfer your bitcoin to an exchange and redeposit fiat to your account. You will pay fees but it’s the ‚safest‘ way.
If you don’t have access to your bank account I’m not quite sure. Maybe try one of those bitcoin machines. I haven’t seen one personally so I am not sure how they work

All the comments make me believe we are rebounding very shortly.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:12:33
What has bitcoin got to do with your bank account?
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:12:21
Bitcoin is backed by a huge community and developers. That’s not NOTHING

It's not even lunchtime in Europe. Plenty of time to catch up :)
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:15:46
This is beatuiful
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:58:13
Would it matter to you if BTC isn’t king but another crypto would play a serious role in the financial system?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:01:26
I didn't invest more than I can afford to lose so it's not money I need for my daily expenses. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 20:55:25
Not too worried until we go below last bottom ~6k. If it rebounces back up before that and above 12k we are probably on a good way
@_date: 2018-03-06 19:55:31
I don't think RSI will go below 50?! would be a good sign if it bounces back off that; I believe. But then I don't really have a clue...
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:36:29
What else is getting destroyed?
@_date: 2018-03-14 16:54:23
Although I am seeing my portfolio shrink by the minute, it's kind of exciting. Those last few months have steeled me. Hodling on with the perspective to buy more if it falls really low. Long term I am believing in Bitcoin and I don't need to worry being in the red for a couple of months.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:43:53
Where are you based?
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:28:28
Just been on a plane for 4 hours. Whats happening? 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:56:23
Thanks for mentioining the Lindy effect. Reading up on it now. Do you see bitcoin adopting ‚higher‘ layers without changing its core values?
@_date: 2018-02-03 15:15:17
Fly Eagles Fly!
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:29:22
Are we actually still worried about the price at this point?
 We have been below the current price recently and new investors or people who believe in the technology got in. Many people who invested in December got out or are holding on for dear life. People who got in early either know the game and HODL or sold to get a nice gain. People sitting on the sidelines are comfortable waiting to see a clear move in either direction. Most weak hands have sold by now.
Long term I believe in bitcoin not only as an investment but as a solid alternative to conservative monetary systems. For any major move upwards, media coverage has to pick up again and we need a few weeks of a solid upward trend.
So instead of checking the price every five minutes I am now trying to do more reading on the tech side and explore how I can actually contribute to Bitcoin and cryptos as a whole. Because ultimately, the motor that is driving bitcoin is the community that has to develop bitcoin into a valid currency for daily usage or a solid store of value.
Where do you see the future? Is bitcoin gonna be digital gold or can it be a serious currency?
Edit: sorry for long text but just trying to get a discussion going that involves more than moon and doom.
@_date: 2018-03-13 18:12:06
I think it will be more stable in terms of percentage. So it might still go up or down by a 1000 dollar in one day but only account for 1%.
But obviously the market cap and value has to be much higher so single people or groups can't influence the market so easily.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:30:24
Well define value then.
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:34:29
I moved some more fiat on my exchange last night. If it really drops that low it’s a great buying opportunity i won’t miss. 
Right now I have no idea where it will go. I hope it bounces back up at around 6k like last time for all the people who put too much of their hard earned cash into it but if it goes below 3.5k i will buy more.
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:37:46
Really depends on your financial situation. You could invest 10, 100,1000 or 10000. golden rule is not to invest more than you feel comfortable losing. Especially if you’re new to cryptos.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:37:19
Dont know why I even feed the troll
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:21:14
If it’s money you can afford to lose, just leave it in there. Follow the market, get to know it better and learn more about the tech side. The more you research about the technology the less you might worry about the price. I think in the long you will make a profit. Of course I don’t have a crystal ball and can’t say if this will be in a month, a year, x years or never. However, I personally think it will, because of the potential of technological advancement of Blockchain, bitcoin,and a few other coins.
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:38:10
I had something similar- I  didn't have money on my exchange and missed the opportunity. First thing I did when I woke up was to change that.
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:39:40
You're welcome. If this your average coin price you're doing better than a lot of people! (including me ;))

Seems like sentiment has changed for the better. We’ve been from 11k back to 6ish not too long ago. Then it was pretty much straight down. Now it seems we turn old resistance into new support. 
So let’s see if we can get to 12k before the next significant dip. (If today’s dip is over I don’t consider it significant in crypto terms)
