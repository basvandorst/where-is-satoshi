No no, I completely agree that Terracoin is the cheapest :P
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:18:25
With exception to Devcoin - all are still alive and kicking! Question is, which coin is the most undervalued today??!
Edit: Spelling
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:50:49
Okily dokily lol. Let me re-phrase that. Which one is cheapest....

No my friend. I'm an Albatross. Not a mouse. Some people think forward before the criminals. This is dericulious. There are no natural predators f0r Albatrosses. Tech is my love. Eventually that's where humanity will be either free on a beach or inside a machine

Corruption is everywhere. A transfer of power and wealth is what's going on here and they fucking hate it. They can't take coins from us and those that know, love it

Seriously. We invented the technology. Tell me we can't protect our shit. Some people are stupid and don't know how to defend but that is evolution at work

No i do not view myself better than my fellow human, we are all one. I try to educate and help wherever i can. We shouldn't even need to understand how money works except for i have this and need that, then an exchange take place. Crypto's facilitate that on a global scale, privately, unlike the current financial infrastructure.
Education is the key however no matter how much we explain some people hear but they do not listen unfortunately and sadly, that is a fact of life

Bless you, sir. We should all say a BIG Thank You to Mr Jamie Dimon for his part in causing massive banking fraud over the years. The banking industry's Asteroid is coming....

aaaaand having ~$850,000,000 worth of Mastercard shares on the books of Berkshire Hathaway has absolutely zero to with his "totally asinine" opinion nor the ~$1,276,000,000 in Visa shares. Nope, nothing. What a quote though: “Our government’s more lax approach to it is wrong. The right answer to something like that is to step on it hard.” Stick to analysing shares rather than suggesting government policy. Another classic quote.... “I never considered for one second having anything to do with it. I detested it the moment it was raised. It’s just disgusting. Bitcoin is noxious poison.” Wow, dude's really got it in for Bitcoin / Crypto's.

Of course, this person has absolutely no reason to slate crypto's. I mean, it's not like the BIS would cease to exist or anything should Fiat currencies become legacy assets in world finance, relics of an archic, broken system.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:25:22
That's twice I've seen you post insulting remarks to some random stranger on t'internet in reference to the very same topic. Funny really, the coin wasn't even mentioned by OP yet you still call names. The exchange (a Bitcoin exchange) was hacked not the coin/blockchain - whichever coin that might be. It's still relevant to as it is a Bitcoin exchange.

I actually read the document in it's entirety -
 it's not linked in the Tweet so I'll kindly link it here -
  I do admit to having a bias towards crypto hence lurking around However, I have known about and been researching the BIS for well over a decade (since before Bitcoin even existed). I am as akin to one of those tin hat wearing conspiracy theory folks as anyone. In a simple sense, his opinion is: DLT / Blockchain very good *thumbs up*. BTC / other crypto very bad *thumbs down*. How they managed to include Bitcoin into their wonderful "money flower" illustration is beyond a joke. Crypto's live outside the Fiat system. This is the problem with Crypto's - they don't fit in with any of the BIS's models and therefore cannot be quantified into an ever expanding black hole of debt. In other words, they like to be the issuer of money, and no one else. i.e. The BIS does not like competition. Who would have thought?
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:41:47
Yep, just another random retweet from the CXO @ Poloniex displaying  trading volume for Poloniex just very slightly exceeding $1b
LOL indeed
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:13:00
Agreed its not valid proof but is tantamount to evidence. However the focus should not be any one particular coin.
Trollbox removal, lack of comms on Social Media, EMC2 has been disabled and still is, which really isn't a shitcoin. Maybe its just a small possibility the margin trading has completely ruined their liquidity hence lack of expansion but that's just a theory
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:45:24
Sure hope it's not true, mainly because a lot of people will lose their coins. However, the silver lining will be cheap coins for everyone and that's not a bad thing. It does seem like  is active on Reddit.
Mike, any chance we can see some images of Poloniex's offices and people celebrating all the hard work and success you have accumulated over the years?
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:24:02
Interesting. Please do your research. Personal attacks aren't nice for anyone
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:51:29
Absolutely! Teething problems are part of any new industry and what an industry it will be but I'm not sure Poloniex should be considered in a teething problem stage considering its age. In my opinion, and I am certain many others will be in agreement that cryptos are not just some random trend.
This is a transfer of not just wealth but power also. No more control over people's money. This is money for the people. What a show to watch
@_date: 2017-07-07 13:28:17
Very interesting. You seem somewhat educated in BTC markets, yet never heard of Poloniex - On 8th of May this year their trading volume reached 1 billion dollars - no-name shit exchange. Not sure I would call it that. Definitely flaky at the moment though
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:27:56
Might very be true about BCN but that does not negate the fact that it has been disabled for weeks. Apparently a Billion dollars worth of trading in 24hrs on Poloniex on 8th of May and can't get the maintenance finished for multiple coins not just BCN so go call that a shitcoin but there are others. Poloniex are either willfully negligent or its becoming the second Mt. Gox
@_date: 2017-07-07 12:17:11
Not fud, just my opinion. I could be completely wrong but err on the side of caution. Didn't say you cannot withdraw..... Actually, I'll go back on that about withdrawals. Yep go on then withdraw Bytecoin (BCN) from the Exchange to your own wallet and show me the TX ID? Yea, thought as much. I'm saying that something is fishy. Too many coincidental issues over a short period of time for something not be up
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:13:16
Never said I had built or was building an exchange. I do own a group of interrelated cryptocurrency organisations that the industry will benefit as a whole not just the area that most speculators focus on, Exchanges. Think bigger, we all need to spend these digital tokens in the real world and currently this is very difficult without the use of BTC debit cards. Love the the sarcasm tho : )
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:39:23
Yarp, me too. I advise others do the same
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:18:27
I think the game is up. Unless we start to see some real substantial progress, Poloniex is over. I said this a few days ago and there's been no response. Check mate unless we see the real figures behind the scene who are made accountable should anything go wrong
Where's the Board of Directors and Office pictures boasting their success? Something is up
I suspect the margin trading on the alts messed up their cashflow but that's just a theory
@_date: 2017-07-14 14:16:21
Exactly. If Poloniex was as legit as people think then we would see boasts of success with office pictures and people smiling, instead. Silence
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:29:02
I can. In fact you can verify yourself with  You can also look at the HTML code
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:37:54
First rule of business. Protect your investment.
No, nothing is perfect. Anything worth having comes at a cost be it time or coins. I completely agree that building something as complex as a cryptocurrency exchange is absolutely not simple but Poloniex has been around since 2014 and still don't see much in the way of expansion only slow dilapidation. By now most large organisations would have, at the very least a telephone number on their website.
I truly hope I am wrong, nothing would make me sadder than have this be true. Been with Poloniex a long time and found everything to work perfectly until issue after issue popped up, its not just me experiencing this. Others have experienced problems too
