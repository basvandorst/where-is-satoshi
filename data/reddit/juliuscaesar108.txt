If Bitcoin is doing just fine, why is it too expensive to make for normal purchases? The TX fees are an issue. The altcoins will eventually face the same issue later, but right now its cheaper to use them than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:30:05
I disagree. Altcoins are great alternatives to use for different purposes, especially in moments like these when there are high fees.

I personally think cold storage on paper wallets is one of the best way to store your bitcoins if you're going to invest. Then again MyCelium and BreadWallet seem great alternatives, too.  But you should also store the passcode on several encrypted flash drives.
@_date: 2015-12-03 00:25:42
You're more at risk leaving money on the exchanges than any of those. You could put the paper wallet or Trezor in a fireproof safe.

People are smart, uninformed, or just stupid. Either way, don't put energy on the bad reputation as you see it - think of the good and talk about its potential. Instead, look at it as a sales position I've learned from working in a call center, "Never anticipate a refusal.  When you reach it, say what you need to say, then move on."
The people I've talked to in my experience don't see Bitcoin the way you described it. Most of them don't know what it is and they have yet to hear about it! (And those who doubt it are just afraid to do something new).
At the same time, be honest of its shortcomings (like the volatility, and not storing the majority of your BTCs in web wallets), you've got a reputation to keep.

Things take time to get confirmed.  It doesn't always take 10 minutes to get a confirmation.
@_date: 2015-12-17 13:36:36
Make sure you have the private keys. If you don't have the private keys move it to a wallet that you have them, and be sure to keep them safe there.
With Coinbase, you buy coins there, then move it to a wallet like Bread, MyCelium, or Electrum.
@_date: 2015-12-02 12:38:15
It's a better idea to buy in small amounts rather than all at once. Happening to be lucky is not everyone has the knack for and is risky.  I buy small amounts around 10 bucks a week rather than focusing on increments of bitcoin.
If you're going to buy 1 bitcoin a month, it's a better idea to buy 0.25 BTC a week, and it would average out quite nicely especially since it's been more volatile lately.
Make sure you don't keep it on your exchange but move it to a brain wallet, paper wallet, or Trezor.
@_date: 2015-06-08 09:04:19
If you use Gyft.com for gift card purchases, it's a little bit cheaper when using Coinbase. I recommend keeping if you use their service.
@_date: 2015-12-03 14:22:31
Uh ... no. They're almost free as in not free, but low cost.  A transaction price varies, but in my experience, I've paid 0.0001 BTC usually to send for every transaction.  That starts around 0.02 British Pounds for you.  Not much, but will add up over time. You want to send 0.0001 to somebody, that will cost 0.0002 including the transaction fee.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:14:09
This is why if you hold on to a large amount, you store it in paper wallets (where you hold the private keys), and have some available in a web wallet for spending money.
Or, use MyCelium, where you have easy access to your money, and hold onto your private keys.
Either way, it's up to you!

Coinbase, like Circle, is a US exchange for Bitcoin.  It's linked to your American bank account which is also regulated.  They are strict about following laws so they can provide a service, but not used to launder money for illegal purposes.
Yes, they are going to snitch on you.
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:59:35
Understood - if you have anything cheaper, by all means suggest a cheaper alternative.  For me, I've found Circle to be my best option for remitting money.

That's an interesting way to look at it! I don't go evangelize Bitcoin, I just talk about it because I'm so interested in it, and whoever is interested in it follows.

Why do you wish to argue?
Regardless if Circle charges for that, I use an international wallet to transfer to Circle. Then Circle to my bank account. Still saving money!
@_date: 2014-12-06 11:28:50
I also live in Korea. As others have mentioned, I buy bitcoins from Korbit  because they have lower prices than Coinplug, then send it to Circle  (assuming you're American) since they usually have the best withdrawal rates. If you live elsewhere, find a wallet that your country can use.
If you live in or near Seoul you can join a Bitcoin meetup at Sedona Coffee on Wednesdays and Saturdays 
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:03:24
Bitcoin is volatile if you're using it to make money. You're best option for using it is for transferring money for international bank transfers (which saves money from foreign transaction fees). Transfer it within an hour to your bank account for there to be little change.  Otherwise, think of it like the stock market.
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:24:21
That's an interesting perspective. Why are you so angry?
@_date: 2014-10-21 05:45:00
Bitcoin doesn't make me wealthy, although I wish I got into it before to make me a huge profit.  What I use it for is to stretch my dollar or other currencies to avoid fees.  If I was losing more money, I would use the more traditional system for remittance and not say how great Bitcoin is.

I must be lucky not to have been requested of that ... yet.  I registered when they first became public.  And for those who distrust/don't use Circle, they gripe about issues like this.
Personally, I find their withdraw rates pretty good. But no, I haven't experienced this.

I hear you, man. I feel the same way. I love the technology for what it is and that it saves me fees in rebitting my money overseas. There's still a rebel inside me, but I've learned not to vocalize it as much because a wider audience will listen to you more if you talk about the benefits instead of demonizing the government and the banks. I think there needs market research on how to implement this on the end user side and the business side to where people would get this going more mainstream.
Let the rebels on the side speak out, but this documentary is probably something for the hipsters and less for getting it more widespread.

@_date: 2014-09-29 14:43:14
For me, I live in Korea.  Transfer money to Korbit (a Korean BitCoin wallet).  With Coinbase, I pay a 1% fee plus 15 cents to transfer to my US bank. I haven't used Circle yet, so I will see if there are actually no fees.
Regardless,  I no longer pay my US bank for accepting international bank transfers. Neither do I pay my Korean bank for sending international transfers. I'm saving money because of BitCoin.

Well Fargo is horrible.  I consistently had fees to worry about as a college student.  They sold my information to third party advertising companies, and found out they were the source.

Bitcoin doesn't have an enemy, but it does have challenges to overcome.  It's a relatively new currency and is yet to be seen as something that people would be willing to exchange cash for.  Since it's new, it needs time to see what it really is and if it can last a long time.
I love what I've been able to use it for, but only have very limited options in using it. I hope for this to change.
@_date: 2014-11-30 12:01:52
My experiences have been different than yours when price checking between Circle and Coinbase.  I am not intentionally misleading anybody, and I don't know why it comes across to you that I was.  While you are giving me the benefit of the doubt now, it would have been nicer if you had asked me questions than thinking I would mislead people, and saying I have not done my research when I have.  It came across to me like I didn't know what I was talking about when I said I have.
I don't need to be told to keep checking the prices because that's what I already do.  Do whatever you think is best in how you handle exchanges, I was just recommending to people what I found best for me.
@_date: 2014-10-27 05:49:19

@_date: 2014-11-30 01:35:42
CoinBase does sell for a cheaper rate *before* their 1% fee, but afterward they charge either the same or more. I compare between the two when I buy Bitcoin from US based wallets.
I usually just use Circle to remit my money from another country since Coinbase likes to shave off 1% of the money when withdrawing to a bank plus a 15 cent fee. I do my research to see what's best, and most of the time Circle has been my best option.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:55:21
How is it not ready for remittance? I ask because I've used it before where I got more than the current exchange rate between two fiat currencies.
@_date: 2014-12-02 14:53:51
Very well thought out post.  Thanks for your reply.  Yes, there is volatility - just as there is a chance of losing from the exchange there is also a chance in getting a profit.  The percentage fees depend from wallet to wallet.
In my case, though - I don't even pay 1% interest, closer to 7 cents for the entire transfer (more or less) to transfer from my Korean wallet to Circle.  Circle doesn't charge an interest to withdraw (unless it's hidden).
Just one more clarification based on your two posts - is your focus on remittance more based from a company doing the Bitcoin remittance for you, or you managing the remittance yourself?
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:09:39
In my experience, the payment was much cheaper. I paid about 16 bucks to send 600 US dollars. My bank would have charged 15 bucks just to receive a foreign transaction fee plus the extra fees involved with sending it. It's much cheaper with Bitcoin.

I used it to pay off my debts to remit money quicker by avoiding bank charges. I also use it to make small arbitrage to get more than what I make from my bank savings accounts.
My ideal is hoping to either have savings get passed onto the consumer or helping business owners make more profit to help boost the economy. Competition with banks and credit cards is helpful for society, where the people have more freedom.

I don't try to "convert" anybody when talking about Bitcoin - I simply talk about it because I enjoy it.  After attending a meeting from a Bitcoin meetup, a friend of mine wanted me to introduce her to it because she was interested, and I said sure without even approaching her about it.  I showed her the meetup and she thought it was interesting.
Then I talked to some people from church about it, and they seemed interested in knowing more about it.

The ins: You could earn profit.
The outs: You could lose (and spend time watching the rates like a hungry predator).
What you should know is that if you live in the US, Circle is probably the best to use because it's easy and there are no fees.
Use Bitcoin to buy gift cards on Gyft and you get 3% back on future purchases (no matter how small). You can also use it to shop around on Overstock and NewEgg or make donations to websites that will fund their organizations (like ThePirateBay, WikiLeaks, or What.cd)
tl;dr Investment always has risk, but you can still use it online to save money without investing or donate to interesting organizations.

You need to work on a wallet where you can set your own price, then make a profit.  Korbit, although a Korean one, you can set your own buying and selling prices.  You wait for it to to be bought and sold at the prices you set, then buy and sell again.  It's a more efficient system.

The key thing to remember is to never put in more than you're willing to lose. Having said that, when investing don't put in much all at once.  You can wait later to invest. Or, if you do something like a dollar a week, that's like putting savings in the bank, without the bank.
@_date: 2014-11-25 13:50:26
While it is true the downsides are the volatile rates when comparing with fiat and the bitcoin price changes base on the current market rates, there are also benefits.
* No bank fees or WU fees for remitting money with Bitcoin (and with Circle, there is no 1% fee for withdrawing).
* No government ID needed - it's like cash!
* Even with fees with other wallets, it beats the prices compared to credit card merchants.
I never needed Western Union so it doesn't fit my demographic.  Having said that, it's virtually free to send and receive bitcoin currency.

As a Bitcoin enthusiast, I would recommend it simply because I want this technology to expand.  Some of us would use your service just because they want to help others using this technology.
How it helps you is that there are no fees in accepting Bitcoin, and you can either profit from it or pass the saving on to customers. Bitpay would make things easier, they are an exchange that would cash the Bitcoins into money on a daily basis.

I think you need to watch your tone before firing back false accusations that I haven't done my research.
It does appear cheaper **to buy** at the moment, but based on the majority of occasions I have compared Circle is cheaper.  Just because Coinbase is cheaper now, doesn't mean it will be later on.  Also take into account while Coinbase is 377.84 to buy, it's 375.29 to sell - it loses value! Also take into account there's a 15 cent fee each time you deposit or withdraw bitcoins to the bank.
When I want to buy and sell bitcoins within an hour, Circle is my better option.
When I remit money from an international wallet, Circle is my better option.
The sell rate and buy rates at Circle are the same, I get no 1% deduction, no 15 cent fee.
I *know* what I'm talking about. Do you?
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:22:31

The purpose of Bitcoin should primarily be the strength of the network ... the Blockchain and its open public ledger and to bypass the systems the government put into place.  Hoping to make money by investing is gambling.
Andreas Antonopoulos advised not to do this ... if you are to invest, it's better to buy a little sporadically.  For example 10 dollars a week.  It's like saving money in the bank, without the bank.

Coinbase has strict rules to enforce to lock you out. Even if you are a law abiding citizen and don't gamble, if you send it to someone who gambles you will be considered suspect and they will lock your account.
They have the private keys to your money which means they control your money, and you don't which isn't what Bitcoin is for. You're supposed to have access to your private keys.
Even if they are honest, the question isn't if they get hacked, but when they get hacked.
If you want to spend your money and still have the private keys, mycelium seems to be a great app. The downside is you have to rely on a phone officially released from the company.

I actually have Reddit Gold so I don't get ads here anyway. The way the Internet works is a cat and mouse game. People don't use the Internet to support a business model, they come to do whatever they want.
YouTube's ads are shows which are bad for productivity. They force you to watch video ads before it starts - you can't just ignore it with a banner ad.
This is why AdBlock or AdBlock Plus is needed.

That's gambling. If you are to invest, invest a little at a time.  Like maybe 100 dollars a week, more or less. The same author who wrote the book you read (which I have yet to finish) advised not to put so much money all at once.  Andreas Antonoupolos told the Seoul Bitcoin community in a Skype chat that he buys 10 bucks a week from Coinbase and transfers it to a Trezor. Paper wallets are also advisable ~ do the smart thing before investing your life savings!

Blockchain.info is fine. There's nothing wrong with using it to keep track of your transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:41:41
You have to wait for blockchain confirmations which is why it says pending. Sometimes it takes faster and slower depending on the age of the coins and other factors. It will happen like that with other exchanges too.
I found the other responses interesting since I don't use myCelium other than to test it.
Coinbase to Coinbase transactions should be instant since they're off-blockchain transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-09 15:00:24
This is what I want to happen, but the way this is worded sounds like faith in something lacking evidence it will "succeed." I have my reasons for liking it, but investing your life savings demonstrates a severe gambling problem.
Buying Bitcoin in small amounts spread out (like 10 bucks a week, for example) is the way to go if you invest, but don't put in more than you're willing to lose.
Otherwise use it as an alternative way to spend or transfer money.
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:01:30

True. The beauty of these exchanges is that it's built on top of Bitcoin, so if you don't like these exchanges, you can still use a different wallet and send it to people who have Circle and not be limited to Circle to Circle or Coinbase to Coinbase.

There are different ways to do it.
=&gt; Easiest Way: Buy Bitcoins from an Exchange like Circle or Coinbase, or others if you live in a country outside of the US
=&gt; Local Bitcoins is another website you can use, but I haven't personally used it.
=&gt; 2 Way ATMs are also another option. Even if one is nearby, they charge you fees usually which won't be worth it if you are selling a lot. If it's a small amount, it should be fine.
Even though you buy bitcoins, make sure you have your private keys.  (A password is not a private key)  If you buy from an exchange, you don't have your private keys. It's okay to buy them from there, but afterward transfer them to a wallet where you're the only one that has access to them.

Riiight ... and it's so much easier to mine them or buy them from an ATM.  /sarcasm
The great thing about Bitcoin is that it can be used for everyone. You don't have to buy Bitcoin this way (I usually prefer Circle), but it's one way to acquire them. If you have another way that's better instead of complaining about centralization, feel free to offer said idea.
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:35:42
One dollar is a lot cheaper than hearing other comments in this subreddit saying it costs 50 dollars for a transaction. Right now I still prefer Bitcoin (BTC) since it's the conventional one. And with all the volatility of the price going up it makes it as though it were almost good as free.
Since people are asking you about why you still have BTC I would also like to know.

Raising fees is not good for the Bitcoin community if they want adoption to increase.  One might as well use a credit or debit card for a coffee than using Bitcoin. I purchased coffee yesterday with Bitcoin.  If I had to pay $0.26 more, I wouldn't have wanted to pay in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not completely anonymous.  The exchanges require your information to buy bitcoin, but exchanges are not required to have Bitcoin. Secondly, IP addresses can be linked to your transactions which can be traced to you. Transactions remain permanent and available to anyone to see it forever. The Silk Road creator got caught, and ironically a fed got caught stealing his bitcoins instead of properly confiscating them.
You don't use Bitcoin necessarily for avoid being traced but for it to be used as a non-discriminatory way to send and receive money. This is not a bug, but a feature.

I like this option.  Remember, Circle is not bitcoin - it's an exchange which uses Bitcoin.
Circle has its limited drawbacks similar to Paypal.  The plus is Bitcoin users can transfer their funds from Circle and be their own bank, or use their Bitcoins to transfer to Circle users.
@_date: 2015-09-28 18:04:31
It's already a given you're supposed to report your income if you receive Bitcoin.  The challenge is how they will enforce it if you don't receive it on an exchange.
The point of Bitcoin is since you can have the private keys if they are off an exchange and the government has no say how to control your money.

I don't think we can be united. Bitcoin is a tool for decentralized use, where people are free to modify it based on what they want.

I realize I will probably get downvoted for this because many people don't want to consider this sinful, but it is harmful to society.  Bitcoin should be used for good to make the world a better place, not for evil.

My bullshit meter is running wild with that idea.  Blockchain and bitcoin being separated? Blockchain is decentralized which for the moment isn't the optimum speed for mass adoption (which can change).  Companies wouldn't want decentralization, but centralization.

If you can find friends who are willing to buy from in Colombia, hats off to you.

It does go up, it also goes down. You don't know the outcome, this is why it's an investment.  You put the amount in for a later time to use.

It's decentralized ... meaning we have different reasons for owning it. For some we have it because it's cool and different, for others it's take away the power from the central banks and government, and/or we hope the value of it goes up.

You do realize Bitcoin is for everyone, right? That's what makes it decentralized. The average person can use it all the way up to mega-corporations.  The beauty of this is even with all the exchanges out there, you aren't limited to them when using Bitcoin because anyone can use it.

Watched it already thanks to BitTorrent ... and have Amazon Prime.  Glad it's available to other users. I'll hit watch while I'm away so the creators can get paid!

Put some on reliable lending exchanges, such as Bitfinex to make interest to earn more Bitcoin.

Man, I could use some Bitcoin right now. Do you need another pizza sometime soon?

Porn shouldn't even exist.  It's a deluded fantasy which dehumanizes people, desensitizes the mind, and it is very harmful.  It's wrong if it's consensual, it's evil when it's forced on people if they don't want to do it.
Having this brought into the Bitcoin subreddit is shameful.  Bitcoin is a technology, which just like cash can be used to buy anything - why advertising using it for unethical purposes?

The first rule of BitClub is: You do not talk about BitClub. The second rule of BitClub is: You do not talk about BitClub. Third rule of BitClub: Someone yells ponzi, falls flat, and squirms, the investment is over.

I like using Bitcoin, too, but at this point it's only speculation. People made speculation last year that it would be worth astronomically more this year and they were wrong.
Let's keep using it as a tool to transfer money, and make of what it is now than making unrealistic assumptions.

The same reason some people are afraid of change.

Find a meetup to join if there is one in your area.  If there isn't, create one.
For me, my friend talked to me about Bitcoin before I became interested.  Be that friend, and keep trying!

Bitcoin is working more under the hood. Adoption is increasing and soon people won't realize they're using Bitcoin. This might be of more value than 100,000 people buying 10 bitcoins.
Bitcoin is being used in more ways than directly owning it.  Two examples of this:
* There are remittance services (like Bitwire, a Korean company) that uses Bitcoin to transfer money overseas without the process the user manually buying and selling.
*  Circle does a similar thing. People can hold onto US Dollars without having to own Bitcoin so the price will be stable.

Being wrong is only an indication of the current moment.  It doesn't indicate the future of Bitcoin from now - time will tell.
Just like stocks, it has its ups and downs.  Unlike stocks, it is decentralized, and that's what gives Bitcoin its power and more resilient as time goes on.  Take away its decentralization to make it faster will make it just like any other centalized bank.
Long live Bitcoin - long live the anonymity of Satoshi Nakamoto!
