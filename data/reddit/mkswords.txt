Mobile wallets are safe if you hold your own keys and practice good password security. I recommend [Airbitz]( for a mobile app that is highly secure and allows you to buy and sell bitcoin easily. You can also set up password recovery questions and it synchronizes across devices so you won't lose access to your btc if you log in with the same credentials on another device.

Airbitz is one of the most popular bitcoin apps and yes there are a few people building apps with it. the SDK was just released so we're trying to get more people to give it a try. :)
@_date: 2016-04-14 18:37:27
really like being able to hide the balance and more easily refer people! the Matterhorn mountain theme is stunning as well.
@_date: 2016-04-11 17:47:50
I use Airbitz for its many features and easy on boarding process for new users. And it was ranked  for privacy in cross-platform apps in the Open Bitcoin Privacy Project's report.
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:34:13
stoked to see this available for Mac OSX. it will really open up opportunities for desktop applications. looking forward to the projects created from the SDK.
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:19:19
[Airbitz]( is what you're looking for. Limits are low now but will be higher soon and you hold your own keys. Your account won't be shut down for mysterious reasons either :)
@_date: 2015-12-05 01:51:56
have them try out Airbitz for an easier experience. they can buy/sell directly through the app and i think they'll find it less frustrating.
@_date: 2015-12-09 00:01:41
anyone else totally unsettled by this implication considering the value of the trust involved? Dr. Wright and Satoshi both seem to want to be left alone and i doubt anyone would want this kind of attention. really careless "journalism"
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:04:49
I'm not fully convinced of that.
@_date: 2015-12-04 02:51:09
so maybe Coinbase doesn't deserve all the hate but there are other easy ways to buy and sell bitcoin in most states through a bank account. Airbitz just launched buy/sell and it works similar to Coinbase but doesn't monitor your transactions and you hold your private keys. they do this by partnering with Glidera, a third party, and it is Glidera that handles the KYC/AML side. Airbitz knows nothing of your identity. it's worth trying out if you have privacy concerns related to transaction monitoring. the regulations currently do not require transaction monitoring so Coinbase is being hyper-compliant in an unnecessary way.
@_date: 2015-12-09 22:53:47
to be fair expecting anything more than garbage from Gawker media sites is setting yourself up for disappointment
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:57:37
Airbitz and formerly Mycelium. Hard to beat being able to buy/sell within the app and get discounted gift cards for Starbucks &amp; Target. :)
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:05:34
maybe prior tax disputes with the Australian authorities or maybe the "reveal" started a new tax dispute.
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:43:46
I use it really often as I get paid in btc. Easiest ways for using it is buying gift cards for Target and Starbucks through the Airbitz app and supporting local merchants listed in the Airbitz directory. I also really like Gyft for almost everything else. Now if only I could convince my landlord to take it...
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:00:25
gotta co-sign on Airbitz. it's really sexy for IOS and very feature heavy with buy/sell &amp; Fold App integration that gives you awesome discounts for Starbucks and Target.
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:22:26
this is the most interesting theory so far.
@_date: 2015-12-10 21:51:32
Still a disconnect for me. The guy seems too smart to endanger his life and family for those things. And he's gone into hiding. If those were his intentions wouldn't he be trying to get more attention? I'm hoping more details come out; this whole this is fascinating &amp; strange. Can't help but think there's more to the story than the options we've been given.
@_date: 2015-12-09 22:55:31
a source close to the situation told me that Biddle was worried WIRED would drop it first. but yeah anything is possible in this situation. not sure dangling crumbs was worth getting a home raided for :/
@_date: 2015-12-10 22:21:24


right! I linked to that in the text. the plot thickens!
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:39:09
I didn't find the details of those posts convincing. Maybe it was his deceased friend and he was outraged on behalf of him? I don't know, just speculating.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:43:00
localbitcoins.com is a good source for same day transactions and if you don't mind waiting just a couple days [Airbitz]( has a buy/sell feature within their app. there are no fees to buy and sell at the moment via your bank account. it's also a very newcomer friendly wallet :)
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:20:37
love love love Fold already and this just makes it that much easier!
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:21:27
Airbitz is easy and feature heavy without being intimidating for new users. they have a cool merchant directory where you can find people locally that take bitcoin and you can easily buy and sell through the app. if you choose to buy/sell within the app Airbitz has no knowledge of you account. HD wallets come standard and you hold your private keys. One Touch Two Factor makes it even more super secure. :) 
@_date: 2015-12-10 01:55:51
yes yes yes. you better be damn sure of your evidence before you claim someone is Satoshi. the raid by the government is bad enough (whether or not it was related to the story) but now he has to worry about other criminals. i don't think he's Satoshi and i'm not fully convinced he was hoaxing either.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:51:51
cool idea Doug!
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:02:29
You can buy &amp; sell through the [Airbitz]( app. No fees until the New Year so you have a couple days to take advantage of that :)
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:57:53
and check that classy AF headline! ugh Gizmodo
@_date: 2016-01-08 01:48:38
The official answer is that they only offer in-store gift cards, and don't have a way to export the card PIN for now.
@_date: 2016-03-29 18:10:17
web wallets are more easily attacked. you might try a mobile wallet where you control you own keys like Airbitz or Mycelium. with Airbitz, the data is encrypted locally on your device and has one-touch 2FA that makes it very secure. it's very easy to start using too. i've also used Trezor for cold storage.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:57:37
Not sure about Breadwallet or Mycelium. With Airbitz you always maintain control of your bitcoin even if all Airbitz servers go down or the company disappears. We connect to our servers and many other nodes including Electrum ones. Your coins are encrypted locally on the device and you can also export the private seed.
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:42:36
instead of transferring between services, Airbitz allows you to buy/sell and btc is deposited directly into your wallet.
@_date: 2016-03-30 00:13:41
I use Trezor and Airbitz primarily. Airbitz is great for a hot wallet and synchronizes across devices so you don't have to worry about losing your btc if you lose your phone. you can simply log back in with the same username and password on another device. also, your btc is automatically backed up so you don't have to worry about long passphrases. the Trezor is great if you have large amounts you're not going to need to access for awhile. :)
@_date: 2016-03-28 18:58:26
great suggestions! I really like Trezor for a hardware wallet and yep Airbitz is hard to beat for a hot wallet. I liked Mycelium for the longest time but find the on boarding process with Airbitz more newbie friendly. used both BitGo and Coinkite for multisig but need to try out Copay.
@_date: 2016-03-14 22:30:46
[Airbitz]( supports several different currency options and has a merchant directory of all the places in different areas that accept bitcoin. You can buy and sell through a bank account (only 1%) within the app and you hold your private keys. Really convenient for traveling and super secure!
@_date: 2016-03-23 20:31:41
As a merchant you might want to give [Airbitz]( a try. You can easily sell bitcoin within the app and the money is deposited to your bank account in most states. The app also has a merchant mode that slightly changes the flow to be more friendly to merchants and data is automatically backed up. Glad you found your bitcoin and I would caution against storing a lot of bitcoin on exchanges. You can also be added as a merchant in the directory of the app. Best of luck going forward.
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:19:02
this has helped me stay organized soooo much!

hodl your coin &amp; hodl your keys.
@_date: 2016-01-05 23:29:23
yikes. when you get access to your coin again I suggest trying [Airbitz] ( for a hot wallet. more intuitive than blockchain.info and more features. one touch 2FA is also way simpler to set up.
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:41:11
if you're looking for an app where you securely hold your keys and can buy and sell bitcoin through a bank account, try [Airbitz](

from Airbitz engineer William Swanson:
"We use cURL 7.44.0, so we are good.
We used 7.34 up to ~September 2015,  so we have been immune since day one."

Chris is one of my favorite people and ProTip is excellent. I really hope this takes off and kills the tacky &amp; intrusive ad based revenue model.
@_date: 2016-01-08 18:24:49
Sorry to hear about that. They've been very responsive to support emails so far and I'm sure they are working on it. The Target gift cards for some reason seem to be having the most issues. I'll see if I can get to the bottom of it :)
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:50:54
I've run into this issue with Gyft and had to look into the details section to find the access code. I realize this isn't an option with Fold but I reached out to them to find out more info for you. I also recommend contacting support
Apologies for any inconvenience, we're working on getting to the bottom of this.
@_date: 2016-03-10 20:38:08
because of how popular the integration has been, cards have been running out. working on fixing this.

great to see bitcoin being used in Indonesia!

no one is claiming that Airbitz was committed to privacy before Apple. he is saying that this was a stance that the company was founded on not something that came as a concern later.
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:45:39
it is open source.
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:57:44
Try [Airbitz]( You can buy and sell bitcoin through your bank account and you hold your private keys.
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:34:19
Great discussion on zero-conf txs.
OP: For a good app to use as a merchant, try [Airbitz]( It has a merchant mode with a slightly different user experience that I think you'll like. For example if multiple people are paying one ticket, the request QR code will change as different people pay to show the updated balance. You can also easily buy and sell bitcoin within the app if needed. And if you would like your food truck featured in the merchant directory, you can fill out a [short submission form](
@_date: 2016-02-17 04:56:45
LibertyX and LocalBitcoins.com are good sources for more anonymity and if you want to buy through a bank account [Airbitz]( is your best option because you hold your own private keys.
@_date: 2016-02-20 02:21:16
right. and they are providing the possibility to extend that level of security to other apps. still huge fans of Apple over at Airbitz.

Willwaukee nailed it. yes, it is similar to Venmo since Airbitz has partnered with Glidera. here's an interesting read on SPV privacy concerns:

you may want to try the Airbitz wallet. it offers automatic, encrypted backups of your private keys, your account can be synchronized across multiple devices in case of loss or theft, and One Touch Two Factor Authentication protects you from logins from other devices that may have successfully guessed your username and password. here's the FAQ to alleviate your concerns: [

I prefer the mobile app [Airbitz]( you hold your own keys, there is an option for password recovery and easy PIN login, and you can save money when you spend btc to buy gift cards for Target and Starbucks. it also has a cool merchant directory so you can see who around you accepts bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2015-11-09 21:55:49
mk at [Airbitz]( here. our mobile app is very easy to use, secure, and has a directory of all the places that take bitcoin that is constantly being updated including vendors that no longer take btc. we also just added buy/sell (in beta mode now) within the app. i totally share your concerns and think bitcoin is very close to reaching a level of usability suitable for nonbitcoiners. :)
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:56:38
great job, Thomas! Purse is awesome.
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:49:34
you can also link your bank account to buy and sell in Airbitz' app but you hold your own keys unlike in Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-11-12 23:45:33
congrats on your first spend! it feels just as good every time. if you're looking for more places to spend bitcoin, check out [Airbitz' extensive merchant directory]( built into the mobile app. it allows you to directly support small businesses who love bitcoin. i hodl a little and spend a little; it's all good ;)
