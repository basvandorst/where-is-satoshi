to be sure it’s just a shiny metal with a few industrial uses.  but at least you know that no one can get anymore of it without spending lots of energy
and yes, anything  that is expensive to mine costs like gold, platinum for example or less analogous since it has more uses palladium 
iron ore has about 50 percent ore grade, so when you dig some up? half is iron, half is waste. copper is closer to 1 percent, so a truck carrying 100 tons of copper ore has about 1 ton of copper in it.  maybe that would be worth $5-10 thousand dollars.  gold ore grade is more like 0.5 grams per ton, which i guess would be something like 0.0000005 percent, so a truck carrying 100 metric tons of ore has 50 grams of gold, so maybe 1-2 ounces, or $1,500 to $3000
anything with a similarly low ore grade is going to cost a lot, because of the cost of the truck, driver, diesel, etc

i can’t tell if you have a good point or a bad one, maybe you can
it doesn’t matter if the fee is .0001 satoshi since it could always be moved to .00001 if it were profitable; and in dollars it looks like it should be since it is more and more money 
but perhaps since the fee is in bitcoin there is a high energy cost to processing it, and so it has to remain high?  that would seem to indicate a cost problem since delivering more value comes with more cost
with fiat, fees are percentage based and don’t scale down as well as they could, but some of that extra cost is for security and audit protection, which should be scalable with bitcoin and so not inflate

by energy.  it takes a few hundred dollars of energy to mine and process an ounce of gold, similar to the difficulty designed into mining bitcoin with energy

yes the IRS gets notified about mutual funds.  when you sell not when you buy necessarily but of course they know, otherwise no one would pay taxes.  or at least no republican

I am curious if you could do a million in a day or two or three and not move the price much

What part? I've heard rumors for some time but this is the first time I had personal proof of words used in a two day period showing up as Facebook ads.  No question on that part
Could have been  waze still open in the background but to me it is close to equivalent.  Apple gives me no way to control microphone and listening usage from its App Store and so either it or approved apps listen 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:07:50
Excitable and dickish.
But ok let's think together.
Let's say to an advertiser only the top 1 percent are worth it rather than every single person.  Let's say of 100mm households that makes 1 million interesting potential targets.  
Let's say advertisers are less interested in the 12 hours of sleep and shower time and would find your 24 hour spec wasteful and a little stupid.    Let's say with a little testing you could narrow hours of interest down to 1 a day.  That's more time than I talk to my spouse typically.  Alternately scientific American says the average American speaks 16,000 words per day.  Conversation speaking speed is maybe 125 words per minute which gives you a total of 2 hours of speaking in a 24 hr period.  Let's stick with an hour, so you now have 24 million hours to deal with in a day.
With better targeting you could do a lot better than that.
Say you only record after the word "want" or "love" or "need"or"god willing"
Several sites I see say you can get 17,000 hours of music on a tb.  Probably that is high quality vs a single voice.  Not sure why you seem to be much lower. Anyway to make it easy let's call it 24,000 hours of voice.  So you need 1,000 tb to store a day, which would cost $30,000 or so at retail.  Probably you could discard it all every couple days, convert to text, or otherwise simplify.
Alternatively there's a four year old gizmodo article suggesting 1,000 tb could be stored in a DVD sized device.  Not sure how that panned out.  Either way it seems likely you could achieve the storage partfor the price of a shitty car in a device no bigger than what you could shove up your ass.
What'd I get wrong?
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:08:45
You said video, I said audio.  Why you changed is unclear.  I said Facebook, you said NSA.
Why you think 24/7 instead of an hour or minute or whatever a day is unclear.  Why you think all people are equally of interest to interested parties is unclear.
In the end I am making an observation more than any particular claim.  That observation is that after having spoken excitedly of some products new to me, not having searched or emailed about them, that I was served Facebook ads a few days later.
I have no knowledge of bandwidth required if this is a thing, nor of storage required, nor of compression nor of storage available. Not my field. 
I have no knowledge of all the studies on this not existing that you claim without citing them exist .
I'll note from our interactions that you are knowledgeable and intelligent but excitable and kind of an ass. From a glance at your history you seem to use the word retard a lot and insult others a lot.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:23:42
Nope.  What exactly is bullshit about the fact that your phone or its apps listen and sell data? Had apple even denied it?
@_date: 2017-03-07 21:43:42
You dont think Facebook or google apps do this?
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:56:12
I don't think it is jumping hoops at all, i think targeting and analytics is the basics of any business or endeavor, and the targeting I have was simple.  THere are many more sophisticated cuts.
Most of your points are easy, if I am an advertiser I could test and pick which hours of the day to listen and the total speaking time being low narrows it further.  My two hours of talking time versus one chosen in my example is not a conflict as you somewhat condescendingly point out; it was a simple reality check on the assumption.  Double it and you had two shitty cars and two asses needed to hold the data if you like 
I don't know whether a loop as in a dashcam that would be only activated to save or record the previous two minutes when signaled would be energy efficient. My phone though has 21 hrs of talk time of which I assume a substantial portion of the energy used is to reach the tower.
This nyt article from this week is slightly interesting in that it shows Alexa records and retains at least all direct interactions 
I assume the packet sniffer is a more serious objection.  Should I assume all traffic sent from My phone is easily seeable and not encrypted?  Such that I could see what it all means?  Is the destination of all of it seeable?
I'm off to bed. Parts of what you have written are educational for which I thank you, more are angry, for which I suggest you consider a calmer state of mind

Recording app?  There are some apps that require you to enable the mic like maps but they shouldn't be listening
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:34:18
I didn't think so. Sent no emails.  I did just re think it all and I wrote a related term in the notes app on the iPhone which could be it, not the same term but it may have been related
Still think it is the mike based on the other term though 
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:14:40
Companies obviously have an interest.
I understand bader meinhoff and believe this is different even so. Could be mistaken.
Had not been aware it has been so thoroughly investigated.  Good to know
Have all the investigations revealed the camera blocking feature is active on the 7? It is.
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:59:53
Yes it did.  Three or four words I have never used before and not writtenshowed up in ads
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:14:43
Well I don't have the Facebook app but a day after using some very obscure terms, no email, no text, I get served ads for those terms
Perhaps some other app was running that apple lets to default use my microphone but I try to close all apps regularly and I use very few
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:57:30
I hear you.  In this instance it was two new ideas to me that I saw on a tour, and they were more ancillary to my work.  So I wasn't  researching or anything but I was talking excitedly about it.  Just a couple to 5 day window where I and never heard of or more accurately thought or talked about the products to where I talked about them and got served ads
Usually it would be hard to know as I understand we use search a lot and gmail reads words too,  but in this case I remain fairly confident that I didn't search, or email
I understand the skepticism but I think it happened nonetheless 
As a sidebar I've also been in a place with an iPhone 7 where the camera was disabled...blurred out.  A colleague with an older iPhone had no issues and the camera worked again when I left
I know that was discussed as a potential feature but I never read that it was released 
It has been though
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:22:16
In what way is it proven that apple doesn't use the mic?  They certainly let apps do so
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:58:20
I'm not sure I made a claim
If I did I'm not sure it was about software
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:47:25
Maybe apple is fighting them
Maybe making a public show
Certainly allowing my iPhone to listen to all my conversations and selling the data and keywords within a day or so to anybody who wants them
How is that different from having the CIA as a customer 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:16:03
For one I didn't use the Facebook app
For two apple could easily require restricted mic usage to when the app is open or such.  It does not, you have to give total permission in order to use some apps at all
You cannot disable it so if I want navigation, I presume I have to give google a microphone in my bedroom 
Though it is impossible to tell

kind of by definition most people cannot have bought bitcoin with fiat at those low prices and seen tht much appreciation

I don't believe I am confusing anything.  You can look at the JPM earnings presentation and decide for yourself what portions you want to call consumer, traditional business/corporate, and then investment banking.  My point however is that blockchain could disrupt many of any of the underlying systems in any segment, but if so banks of all kinds would use it to lower cost
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:26:38
I'm not arguing and it doesn't matter either way but I was curious.  
2q17 consumer and community banking and services net income $2.2 bn. 
Corporate and investment bank 2Q17 net income $2.7 Bn
Commercial banking 900 mm.  You could I guess call this either investment or traditional but I would say traditional banking
Asset management 600mm.  Not really investment banking or trading, just asset management 
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:51:52
JP Morgan is both
Also trading and clearing can be dramatically simplified and reduce back office work
J.P. Morgan would be more likely to use blockchain to reduce cost though and keep the business one assumes

Is bitcoin shortable? If not comparing to a market of offsetting hedges that net to a smaller number wouldn't seem to make sense, nor really would it fit the sense of what people mean in the above comments on how high it can go

My impression was the above compared market cap of bitcoin with total notional value of other instruments 
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:14:55
the fact that bitcoin cannot seem to displace exploitative stuff like that and instead has a primary useage base of hodlers and speculators is a continual demonstration of its failure
