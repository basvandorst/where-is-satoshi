Just cashed out all my coin from Binance, just in case.

Yeah I get it, ive heard everything you said shoved down my throat since I got into Crypto 6 years ago. But the truth is for noobies trying to create their own software wallet I have seen some people lose all their coins because they dont know what they are doing. And as far as a hardware wallet, they are the best, but why would someone invest $100 in a wallet when their bankroll is only $200? Its not practical. So using exchanges is a viable cheap alternative for those that are new to crypto.

Keeping your money in Coinbase or another exchange is not a bad idea if you know nothing about keeping your own wallet and only invest a few hundred dollars. I had .25 bitcoin on coinbase for over 4 years with no problem. I cashed out and received my money. The only time I would really worry about getting away from exchanges is when you have alot of money invested in Crypto, chances are your crypto will be safe with Coinbase.

Yes what he says is true, why worry, theres no point. Be prepared for another drop, but it will go back up, HODL!

HODL - This is what happened 2014. There are double the crypto users now. Just Hodl. It might take a year or 2 but just HODL.
