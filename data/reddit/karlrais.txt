No, we will not keep growing in this rate forever. That's an absurd claim and you must understand that it won't happen. Some people will never use Bitcoin, most likely the majority of people will never use it. 
Also You seem to assume that the choice is between huge blocks(1gb+) vs 1mb+LN. It clearly isn't. Fact is that the current block size is not functional long term, no matter how you do the math it still won't be enough, neither will SW. At one point we will have to raise the block size itself. Even the core devs admit it. That's the most absurd part of this all and shows that it's more about politics than the tech. 
This is where the conspiracy thoeries start that the people who work for Blockstream are intentionally trying to hurt bitcoin adoption or atleast slow it down by not raising the block size.

If there is a real demand for something(water,food etc), cause of the use cases then yes, you can say that everything works like that. But if the item in demand has limited use cases (but is told to be the source of UNLIMITED POWER in the distant future, once the plebs understand its potential. Cause you see, they just too stoooooopid to get it right now) then it falls under a Byramid Stream for me.

You really believe that no other devs could have made bitcoin support the current 1MB limit, are are you just typing shit for the lols?
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:09:53
If by all time high you mean speculative high then yes it's an all time high. 
As someone who uses bitcoin as it was intended (p2p cash), I can also say that we are at an all time low when it comes to usability. Highest fees, longest confirmation times. 
The current high is purely speculative and not related to any real use. The people that need bitcoin the most as a store of value don't have access to it cause it's either unknown to them or the fees are too high. People in the west don't need Bitcoin as a store of value, they buy it mostly for speculative greed. To that I say, go buy stocks.

After reading a post on the other sub, I have to admit that this indeed is starting to look fishy. Still doesn't explain why nullc held onto this "bombshell" for 4 months though. But at the end of the day it doesn't matter, cause SuperNerd doesn't have influence any more?

Talking about Blockstream, not core. There is a difference and you seem to deny the obvious conflict of interest. If there weren't any then they would be open on how they plan to make back their investors money. Even if it was solely to attract new investors. They aren't doing this and this is a real concer.

I did not buy any bitcoins because of developers. I bought them because of what bitcoin was and promised to do. I couldn't give a flying f who the developers are aslong as they follow the path and I'm willing to bet on the fact that most bitcoin owners have no clue who the so called developers are. Likely wouldn't even be able to name 1 of them. You really need to step outside of your bubble.

You can use estimates, but assuming that the growth will continue in the same pace is stupid, especially since we are at capacity. There isn't anywhere to grow. You want to limit bitcoin cause of estimates that we won't even be able to test in the current state.


Stop trying to strawman me, as if I said that all transactions need to be on the blockchain. I literally said it's retarded to think that the choice is between 1mb+LN or huge 1gb+ blocks, but you seem to have ignored that part.


Nothing to discuss here as this is a strawman.


And I could also dig up the numbers showing that we can support 8mb blocks easily. Odds are that you have already seen those numbers aswell. So yes, it's politics not tech talk. We can support bigger blocks, but we won't cause politics and artificial fee market...


It won't grow forever and it will never reach 100% or not even 50% of the people, solely because centralised systems are more effective than the blockchain. Stop thinking as if Bitcoin is best at everything, it just isn't. "Everyone will want to use Bitcoin blockchain" isn't an argument, it's insanity. 
We can see from 21.co micropayment system that there isn't much need for it atm. This can easily be projected over to LN as there just isn't a lot of people who need to do many transactions at a time. Just a lot of people who want to do a few transactions and for this we need bigger blocks. No other way around this. LN is only effective when a person wants to do a lot of transactions in a short period of time.
Instead of strawmanning like a boss, you should address the fact that the tech can support 8mb blocks right now, but it isn't. The "8mb blocks will just fill up in 2 years" bs is not an argument. it doesn't address the fact that we can support those numbers right now and that we are at full capacity.
And just as a sidenote. Being at full capacity doesn't mean blocks have to be 1mb 24/7. It means that there are often periods when the backlogs take hours to clear. This has a chilling effect and people will stop using Bitcoin for a few days so the backlog will clear up. Claiming that we are not at capacity, cause backlogs clear up eventualy is dishonest. Backlogs are becoming more common. It's no longer something you see once a month.

The thing is that the people on the other sub would say exactly the same about the leaders of this sub. I'd rather not lable others based on the actions of 1 person. For now I'll continue to read both subs as there is uniq info on both subs. 
My biggest problem about this sub is Blockstream and how you are not really allowed to discuss this. I'm suspicious of the motives of the firm. I don't think they have a public statement on how they plan to make money for their investors. As long as I don't know that I will be very suspicious about any new upgrades that the people working for blockstream proposes. The investors of Blockstream are not your average Joe's. They are pretty much killers when it comes to the finance sector and I can bet that they are not in it for the greater good of us, the average Joe's. They saw this investment as more profitable than simply buying bitcoins and I really want to know why.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:18:29
My personal fear is that we will not get to the adoption rate that is needed for stability as we are pretty much at maximum capacity atm. Need to start opening vents to release some pressure. Hopefully it happens soon.

I'm amazed, there still are reasonable people on this sub. Tired of these "go back to rbtc, you shill" sort of replies.
Your arguments sound solid and are actualy quite similar to my own. I sort of understand why you used the strawmans aswell. Because as it is with everything, the most extreme people are also the most vocal. 
I'm quite sure that a lot of people on the other sub share your views, but the difference is that they (including me) believe that miners will be smart enough to pick the right block size as most of them followed the parameters given by core in the past and some still do. I believe this because their income depends on it. 
Was Bitpay that proposed the model where the blocksize is raised by a small % every year? I liked the idea back then and I still like it.

But for some reason the wise people of this sub are eating up unprooven facts and don't even see the irony in it. "We must keep everything safe and only cryptographically legit proof is accepted". Unless we like the unprooven facts? xdxd

Real demand = people know the use cases of said thing and value them enough to pay more. With bitcoin as is, this doesn't stand. A lot, I'd say most have bought into the hype, not the technology itself. As someone who uses bitcoin to do business I appreciate the technology a lot more than any promises of a greater future that is just 1 BIP away. I was basicly using WU before and Bitcoin is just that much better. 
The businesses you just named use Bitcoin to earn Fiat. For them Bitcoin is a technology and not a store of value. Same for me. Bitcoin is still way too small to be considered a store of value. Foul play or slight stupidity might cost you your whole wealth. It can be seen as a store of value, but it would have to be one of the worst ones out there. Risky investment, sure, but store of value, hell no.

We will see bitcoin under 800$ or even 600$ as the battle continue. People will just cash out their coins and wait to see how it all plays out. Then buy back in, but the problem is that they might not buy bitcoins. 
Bitcoin price will continue to go down as the possibility of a hardfork goes up. I will not be betting on which chain will be worth more in the end, but I have a feeling that it would be smarter to sell before hardfork and rebuy later as 100 BTC will cost more than 100BTC+100BTU after the fork. Might even be able to buy 150 of each, post fork.

@_date: 2017-03-04 16:26:35
No, it would not plummet to 0.5$, but don't act like you got millions to spend on Bitcoin, because you don't. The problem with Bitcoin is that if you buy 5k coins the price goes up 100$, if you sell it drops 100$. Meanwhile the market cap changes by 2bil. Basicly putting 5m $ into BTC makes the market cap go up by a billion. Hope you understand how small % of the current 20bil market cap is actual value and how much is air.I'd say a good 90%+ is air.
@_date: 2016-03-07 14:18:07
No plans on spending, just hodl.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:38:42
People really don't seem to understand that it only takes someone to dump 5000 btc on any of the bigger exchanges to drop the price by ~100$. At best I'd say Bitcoin is holding around 2bil in real value and if someone sold 1m coins then he would suck out most of the value stored in Bitcoin. This is why they keep pushing for an ETF. Knowing very well that they can't even cash out 10% of their coins without plummeting the price. 
ETF is basicly a way for the super rich (whales) to cash out their Bitcoins at highest possible price. Without an ETF it will be impossible to sell any significant amount of coins without triggering a panic sale. Do not fool yourselves and think that the people pushing for an ETF have your best intress in mind. They just want to cash out without plummeting the price.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:53:57

This update will not steal your coins or mine. It's just an upgrade to the protocol and idc who provides it. Bitcoin is in need of upgrades and if Core won't give them then there will be others who will. This is why BU happened in the 1st place. I'm personally not impressed by the BU code quality, but I do support EC over 1mb blocks. In all honesty I think any scaling solution is better than the 1mb cap that we have right now. This includes segwit without any discounts. Segwit should compete fairly with other transaction types, but Core understands that there isn't a huge need for segwit atm and that's why they are forcing people to use it via discount. I can't support that.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:26:50
If it's so efficient then it doesn't need a discount. 
Pointing out how smart you are really makes me trust your opinion that much more. Really, no joke.

Here comes the conspiracy theories. Got anything better or that's it?
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:24:16
If BU became the leading dev team and they refused to lisen to what the people wanted then they would just get replaced by a new team. 
This is why Bitcoin can't be hijacked. If something like "BU becoming the lead dev team" wasn't possible then it would be that much easier to hijack Bitcoin by just compromising the Core devs. And trust me, you can dig up or make up dirt on anyone if you have the powers that the American gov does.
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:58:56
Bitcoin is not worth 20bil, just to start with. Go sell 100k coins and see if the market cap is still 20bil or will it be more like 15bil? Most likely even less.

I'm a EC supporter not BU.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:20:40

They should give us the code and let us vote. Who are you to talk for the industry or the community.

Go strawman somewhere else troll. 
Sure there are altcoin pumpers on rbtc, but they are so obvious paid shills that they make me cringe every time I see one. I'm waiting for the moment that a dev team works out how to scale infinitely. Then we can add it to Bitcoin and make it the one and only coin, cause we can do everything that other coins offer, by just doing them off the main chain.
Bitcoin as just gold will die a slow death and you are a fool if you don't see it.

Just for the record, I'm a user.
@_date: 2017-03-19 10:15:47
At this point many people, including me, would not accept a simple blocksize bump from 1mb to 2mb. If we did that then Core would get us into the same situation in a few years. Blocks will be full and the circlejerk will continue. 
The solution that I'd accept is an upgrade of the blocksize that would either make it grow in a timely manner (with conditions that must be met, such as a growing amount of transactions in the last x blocks compaired to the y blocks before those). 
It could just  be based on the amount of transactions included in the last x amount of blocks as something like this:
IF average_blocksize(x amount of blocks) &gt;= 0.75*max_block_size THEN max_block_size = 1.25*max_block_size
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:49:00
I agree, I just don't agree with giving it a special discount. If it's the superior transaction type then wallets etc will start using it anyways.

@_date: 2017-03-25 14:02:01
When BU nodecount started to go up then people on this sub  said that hash rate is all that matters. Now people are saying the opposite which is very shady if you'd ask me. 
And I can also play your game where you follow your  ~~all knowing supreme leaders~~ Core devs like a religious person.

@_date: 2017-03-26 14:43:02
Then don't cry when other devs give their code instead. It may be lower quality code, but atleast it's something. And from the looks of it there are a lot of people who are okay with something vs nothing.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:55:17
Segwit is at 25%? Even if BU fully switched to segwit then it would not be 95%. Segwit isn't getting my support cause of the unfair discount it gets and I'm sure that there are more than 5% who agree with me. Meaning segwit (at 95%) is dead on arrival. Segwit is a capacity increase with addons and I personally just want a block size increase for starters. Then we can start looking into a segwit hardfork or combine the two.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:53:17
No point in argueing with a person that thinks forking to upgrade is default a negative thing. Your stand is religious and not very logical.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:46:55
How much would it cost to set up 10000 nodes? Not that much compaired to mining. I don't trust node counting for this obvious reason and neither should you. And running Core software doesn't mean the person is anti-EC. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:03:29
Sold at 1140, bought back at 930$ roughly.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:40:55
It curently takes ~5000 coin dump to drop the price by 100$ or more. Now imagine what would happen if someone actualy dumped 50k. Add another 50k from people who would panic sell and you could see bitcoin well under 500$. Bitcoin does not have 20bil invested in it. At best I'd say it's 2bil, most likely even less than that. The market cap is a very misleading number to use.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:14:35
Miners can vote with hash power, regular users can't. It's that simple.
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:25:34
No, forking to upgrade Bitcoin isn't a bad thing. A fork isn't hostile to Bitcoin by default. If the fork confiscated coins then that would be hostile, but an update to the protocol is just that, an upgrade. It doesn't attack anyone or steal coins from anyone. Noone would support such forks.

Or you could just accept that there are people who don't like updating Bitcoin with a transaction format that  is discounted from the others. If the transaction type is that much better then it can compete with others, without the discount. 
And don't act as if there is no logic behind BU. There is logic behind both implementations and miners are voting on which they want. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 14:52:53
Once BU has enough hash rate (I believe they were aiming for 75%?) it will surely happen. I doubt BU would be succesful without the 75%+ margin or any other HF. We are in for a ride and once the dust settles it will be MOON :D
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:48:39
Somone should do the math and check if this could possibly be a miner. Depending on how much this thing cost vs how much more in fees were paid cause of it might be interesting. Would a large mining pool profit from artificially boosting the fees for a period of time? I find this a lot more likely than blaming BU supporters.

Thank the 1% for the current price. If all those coins that they hold would be traded freely then Bitcoin price would be at ~100$ or less. You want the 1% to hold as much coins as possible if you want the bitcoin price to surge up.  
The only reason winklevoss brothers and other whales want their ETF approved is because they know that it would be impossible to sell even 10% of their coins without plummeting the price. 
You'd have to be a fool to think they really care about the average person and "freedom". They don't know what it's like to be an average person and could never relate to us. They just want to cash out a safely as possible.

I'll believe the LN hype once it's up and working. If this moment comes tomorrow then everything will be great, but if LN won't be ready in the next year or 2 then Bitcoin will continue to bleed users to alts and possibly lose the nr 1 status it has atm. I can see that whenever LN happens the nr 1 coin will stay as the nr 1. There would be no further need for other coins as scaling is the is all end all problem of crypto. I want Bitcoin to stay nr 1 by growing its userbase and EC will make that possible. 
Also you must understand that miners will not make massive blocks cause of the risk of getting them orphaned. You can make a 1gb block but that doesn't mean other miners will accept it and you will just lose your block reward. It will be a try and error by the miners to figure out the optimal size to minimise the risks. There is no need to panic.

There are people who want a code with HF blocksize increase. BU is offering that code and Core isn't. If Core gave their version then the situation would settle fast.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:10:19
A fair amount of people are dissapointed in how core has handled the whole scaling issue and are now looking for other options. BU offers something core doesn't, namely raising the block size via hardfork. For some reason core isn't interested in providing the code for a hardfork so that the miners could vote. From the looks of it this might end with Bitcoin having a new lead development team. Only time will tell.
And then the whole digital gold vs digital cash debate. Core supports want digital gold but BU supporters want a payment system. Both sides are at the extreem end of the spectrum, but idealy the two will meet somewhere in the middle.

Not an argument.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:00:55
People are desperate for a change even if the change is a "non-compatible, incompetent, buggy codebase that is over 4,000 commits behind core". And as people keep saying, it's the users that matter, so maybe Core should start lisening. BU supporters are not evil central bankers, people like you really need to start considering that the problem might not be with BU. It might be the lack of options to choose from.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:22:51
Maybe once Bitcoin market cap goes to 5bil then we can start upgrading :)
@_date: 2017-03-25 10:11:53
I have a feeling that there are a lot of people waiting on Core to say something along the lines: "Here is the HF code and if you guys want it then vote and we will continue working on the new code that we just provided". Sure, it might have issues, but those can be solved. 
If Core did that, then people would see that it's not about politics and about what the users want. I'm sure it would get consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:11:07
People are cashing out to wait on the sidelines. All it shows is that like it or not but BU is real and people are acting accordingly. Laughing it off won't work.

Then he would add 100k worth of wealth to Bitcoin, but the market cap would go up a lot more than that. This is why the market cap doesn't show much.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:20:44
The number of things that have been used as store of value is HUGE. Bitcoin or gold 2.0 as you put it, is nothing new and it will more likely than not be replaced by new "things". Only way for bitcoin to survive is to evolve and reach the masses and at the current state it just isn't possible. So it won't happen.

Segwit as is doesn't have 95% support among the community or the miners. Remove the unfair discount and give me an option to vote for a segwit HF/SF, cause I will not vote for the current version of segwit no matter if it's via SF or HF.

Wouldn't it just make more sense to sell it now for 2 btc and when btc hits the magical 1mil per coin then you will have a solid 2mil. Keeping the coin seems like a loss if you are banking on bitcoin going up. The only reason to keep something like that is to make a bet for bitcoin to fail. If bitcoin fails then stuff like the Cas coin will be worth more, cause that's how things work in this world for collectors. Once its dead it goes up in price.

I doubt that. I actualy use bitcoin daily and have gotten quite a few people into bitcoin. I use bitcoin to earn wealth and I don't see it as a get rich quick scheme, but as the price has gone up a fair bit then it's time to cash out some profit from the digital gold fools. I have even stopped suggesting bitcoin to my customers/friends as with every passing day bitcoin is changing to something I didn't sign up for. If I wanted a store of value I'd buy land.

Who are we fooling, there will be a massive dump pre 1000. Believe it or not but a lot of bitcoiners (especially the newcomers) are in it to make a few bucks quickly and once a whale dumps they will panic and sell. I'm selling ~30% of my coins as we speak, but gl!

They use bitcoin to make money. It's like using currency to do business. Saying that "I'm holding bitcoin cause it will soon be 100x it's value" sounds very much like a ponzi scheme which really does require a lot of "fools" to buy into bitcoin as a store of value. There is just no other way if we are looking at it from a store of value perspective instead of utility. I don't consider bitcoin's store of value as utility because there are plenty to choose from. Most of which are a lot safer than owning bitcoins which can just go to 0 at any point. Bitcoin the digital gold is 100% a ponzi scheme that requires more people to buy in and the ones that bought early will profit the most, this will come to bite us in the ass at 1 point. Bitcoin the p2p money is not a ponzi in that sense.
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:51:22

I personally think there is a combination of intelligences that makes a person "smart" and based on what I have read I can quite safely say that Ver is "smart" by those standards. Does this mean he would be consdered smart when tested solely for visual-spatial intelligence, I don't know.

Absolutely nothing I assume? Instead of having a reasonable discussion all I see on this sub are witchhunts based on statements taken out of context or just plain lies.

This was a reply to the "incoming 4k per coin" bs. I personally see btc spiking a bit past 1k, then dropping to low 900s (that's when the people on the sidelines jump in) and then jump past 1100-1200$ after which a few whales will offload. Where the price goes after that is uknown. Unless China passes some anti-btc laws, then it will be a hard fall back to 500-600$, also we will have to wait out Trump. That will surely be a bust or boom moment.
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:37:07
If you can give me the figures of how much he spent on those mutiple times then it would help your argument a lot. If the amounts are significant then I guess it's fair to say that he has run multiple times.
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:27:50
Cause doubling from 10 cent to 20 cent is really the same as going from 800$ to 1600$. You must see the problem with this.
Bitcoin isn't a ponzi, but the digital gold part sure does look like one. If you are working with a fixed def. of ponzi then bitcoin won't fit, but so won't all the new ponzies that are created nowdays. In that sense they are legal ponzies as the person under you can in theory earn more than you etc.
You can't really think that I was refering to currencies as store of value? That's some nice strawmanning I must say. There are plenty of store of values around which are more safe than bitcoin.
The tools that goverments have will only get better with time. Also governments seem to bet getting more authoritarian by each passing year so atleast an attempt to ban bitcoin is very likely and I can see digital gold being a good way to justify it.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:23:54
In theory yes, but in practice it's more likely that I'll use the profits I made to earn new bitcoins and end up with more bitcoins than I had in the 1st place. I don't see bitcoin price jumping 25-40% every month or so, but I can make a 25-40% profit on every $ I have, up to a point atleast. ;)
@_date: 2016-12-20 17:56:29
How out of touch are you? 2-5x profit? There is a very real chance bitcoin will go to 0 at some point. The more I read replies from people that see bitcoin as digital gold the more I understand why some people from butcoin etc are convinced that bitcoin is nothing more than a ponzi. I don't think you can even argue against it if bitcoin's main utility was the store of value. More people need to buy in for the early investors to profit. I can see the media spinning this once the governments start clamping down on cryptos and there won't be anyone else to blame than the digital gold folk. This is a very real possibility.
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:52:39

@_date: 2017-04-12 08:50:33
I think you have no clue how low the UASF support is. Even BU likely has more support behind it. Just face the reality. This UASF will not happen, cause it won't get the 95% support that is required for a fork. You can give me all them downvotes, but it will not change this fact.

Are you stupid? He was not interested in me giving him any facts. if he had been then he wouldn't have used the SJW tactics.


Is this a rational way to debate? The default mentality in this sub is that everyone who doesn't support segwit is unrational so it doesn't matter how many names I list. You are starting to seems like a SJW aswell.
@_date: 2017-04-28 11:54:59
The original vision included large data centers. Keeping the blockchain small in size wasn't the plan and if there is value in doing so then Core should start their own alt with 10kb blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:07:33
Adding a discounted transaction type surely is nothing controversial and doesn't need the 95%+ consensus? I hope you are joking. If anything then such a change should ideally have 100% of support.
But about the 95% mark, what % is the correct one? I personally agree with Gavin on the 75%, which is plenty to make the 25% chain irrelevant. Miners will abandon it, cause the block rewards will come in very slowly compaired to the 75% chain. Plus the price of the 25% chain coins would likely plummet, cause of the lack of usability.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:44:41
We will see, but I have a feeling that the average redditor overestimates the impact that they have on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is something way bigger now and I see great things in the future :)

The 1st was my intent.
@_date: 2017-04-20 08:59:52
And to continue with your analogy. We will now have a bag of 1kg of nuts and a huge bag containing 3kg of shells. This all has to be stored somewhere and it will be more expencive to store these 2 bags than it would be to store 4kg of unpeeled nuts, just cause they take less space.
///Advocting for segwit as a way to save space is wrong in so many levels. If you want to argue for segwit then stick to the things that it fixes, cause in overal segwit transactions will need more space than the old format.

No idea tbh. But I don't see why it wouldn't be compatible with Core as they are basicly the same and the only major difference is the blocksize limit.

It's such an overhyped term that's being thrown around. Do you think that the majority of Bitcoin users really care about decentralization? Do you think that even 10% do? Decentralization might be something that the devs/tech savy people care about, but it's not what gives Bitcoin its value. The value comes from people willing to put their money where their mouth is. Decentralization is a wet dream of people that are anti-government or plain tax dodgers. This is by no means the majority of people and for Bitcoin to MOON, we will need the majority to start using Bitcoin.
We clearly have different visions when it comes to Bitcoin. I want money that is used globally. This doesn't mean that it "could be used if you paid the right fee", but actual money that is useable by even the people living in 3rd world shitholes.
You want a decentralized store of value, that you could use to make global payments(in theory), but likely wouldn't use often, cause of the fees.
I'm not sure if we can have both. It likely won't be possible.
@_date: 2017-04-29 22:05:32
Nothing wrong with the original idea. Core devs are trying to change the original idea behind Bitcoin. Small blocks is a new idea that is being pushed by Core and if it has value then they are welcomed to try it on their alt. I personally want to follow satoshi's vision and I am willing to put my money where my mouth is. 
There is no "being right" or "being wrong" with block size. There are obvious downsides and upsides for both and I prefer Bitcoin with datacentres. Some other coin can be the Digital Gold with small blocks and even smaller blockchain.

@_date: 2017-04-20 09:41:32
If someone doesn't upgrade. Does the block size limit get "eliminated" for him or in that case it stays?


How is the peeled data stored then? It would only make sense that if you separate 2 pieces of info then you'd have to add another variable to be able to link them later. This would result in a higher cost of storage overal compaired to keeping them attached. Or is segwit disposing of some data that will never be used/reffered to again?


If you take a normal transaction and turn it into a segwit transaction. Will the overal storage required to store the entire info about this 1 transaction go up, down or stay the same? I don't mean the info that gets store on the Bitcoin main chain, but everything linked to that 1 specific transaction.
@_date: 2017-04-20 11:06:48
Fair enough. If that's the case then I personally don't see a problem with segwit. 
I have 1 last question though. Why does segwit need the discount if it's the superior transaction type? Wouldn't people just start using it, cause it would enable 2x tps compaired to old format? What would segwit without the discount be like?
@_date: 2017-04-27 13:04:43

@_date: 2017-04-20 07:24:29
Wrong. The current devs are no longer working on Bitcoin. They are trying to make Bitcoin into their own altcoin. The original idea involved having a datacentre as a node and guess what people still liked Bitcoin enough to invest into it. Keeping the blockchain small was never the plan, it's something that the Core devs are trying to push. They should honestly make their own altcoin with small block size and if it's that much superior then clearly people will invest in it. The size of the blockchain was never the issue before Core made it into one.

@_date: 2017-04-20 09:12:19
Miners have more to win from Bitcoin succeeding than an average user. It's a bit amusing to see you claim as if miners operate on purely profit and users don't. The magic of Bitcoin is that everyone should operate from the view of maximum profit. Maybe instead of avoiding centralisation we should focus on making centralisation a non-issue. I hope that's a possibility as it would make Bitcoin that much better.
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:16:54
Why so? I basicly boosted my stash by ~25% with the whole SEC joke.
And please stop with the BS that Bitcoin will go from 1000$ to 1million overnight. Only way this would happen is if USD/EUR lost all it's value overnight. And even if that happend it wouldn't mean that the buying power of 1 bitcoin would change.
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:26:54
Ideally yes, but I can see why they wouldn't. Just so you know even if 75% miners switch to BU it doesn't mean that if BU nodes all shut down at once then Bitcoin goes offline. Miners/Businesses run multiple different implementations to avoid just that. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:15:08

If same work can be done at 85% energy usage then I don't see it as a bad thing. More miners should look into these sort of advantages as that's what I'd expect from a miner. To get as much profit as possible while securing the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:37:59
Vast majority will go with the miners. I think you overestimate the % that tech savy redditors make. The average person/investor does not read reddit daily and will just follow the longest chain. As much as you dislike it, it's the reality. The average Bitcoin user will not care who is in control as long as the transactions keep confirming. Bitcoin isn't geek money any more.
If Bitcoin acted based on reddit then the price would be likely way under 1000$, cause lets be honest we are in a stalemate with little chance on getting anything done. The current 1200$ price tag is more than enough proof for me that Bitcoin is now larger than the reddit subs and the importance of reddit is diminishing with every new bitcoiner. 
Soon the amount of people demanding for cheaper transactions will take over. This is also becoming more clear by the day. The market will do its magic and everyone not on board will just be left behind. The more Core stalls the faster they will be replaced and I see this as a good thing for Bitcoin the p2p cash. Not that great for Bitcoin the digital gold.
/// Another good way to measure how small the % of tech savy people make compaired to the average user is the very low amount of full nodes Vs users. No matter what implementation, Core, BU, Classic or w/e.

It amusing to read how all you hardcore bitcoin experts are convinced that segwit = LN. Let me burst your bubble, segwit != LN. 
Noone is against the ideal LN (as it's been sold to people and miners), but a lot of people understand that the real LN might not be as godtier. More often than not things that need massive advertisement are useless or shity products. Good things sell without the need of advertisement.

If I'm missing something then tell me. The overal impact of segwit will be that we will have blocks that can go up to 4mb, but it will not boost the tps by 4x. At best it will boost it by 2x?

If you honestly believe that you understand Bitcoin better than a miner who has managed to survive in the mining scene then you are either a narcasist or just an useful idiot.

@_date: 2017-04-20 08:55:15
So you agree that it does nothing about block size. What it does is add a new transaction type with a new variable called block weight limit. You go off track with 


It only does this to segwit transactions. There will still be a hard limit of 1mb for old transaction type. In a rational world everyone would agree that this means that the block size limit doesn't change.
You continue with 


This is peeled nuts vs unpeeled nuts. Just cause you have a way to add peeled nuts into the mix of unpeeled nuts doesn't mean that the bag gets bigger. What it does mean is that you are going to have to have 2 bags instead of 1. 1 for the mix and another 1 for the peels that in overal will use more storage than just leaving the nuts unpeeled.

I think they have another fix that achieves the same results as segwit.
@_date: 2017-04-20 15:57:18
I was not that against the idea of segwit as it does fix some problems, assuming you stop using the old transaction format. My main issue was about the discount and I had the impression that segwit transactions are actualy fair bit larger in size. That for every 10 segwit transaction in a block you could fit 10+ normal transactions. If the extra size is just a byte or 2 bigger then it's a non-issue. And about the discount. If this is true then I can accept the reason behind having a discount:


@_date: 2017-04-20 09:18:25
There is no Bitcoin without users that mine. If you exclude these users then you'd make Bitcoin useless.
@_date: 2017-04-24 10:54:00
I'd agree with you if I thought the miners were hostile. But as the Bitcoin hype is actualy bigger in china than anywhere else then I don't believe they'd be stupid enough to shoot themselves in the foot. I trust them to choose the best block size that the network can afford and even if they didn't then they'd risk getting their oversized block orphaned and lose the block reward+fees. 
I don't get it why people assume miners will be making massive blocks. It just doesn't make any rational sense to me.
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:05:19
But why can the blocks go as big as 4mb while the tps can't go up 4x? This sure feels like using more space and being able to do less transactions.
@_date: 2017-04-12 10:48:08
Nuking a piece of land makes it unusable, going nuclear with Bitcoin would likely make it unusable aswell.

I'd say the main fear is that once Core devs get segwit it will be the end the line when it comes to onchain scaling as some devs claim 1mb is already too big, but I bet there are other reasons aswell. 
I'd personally sum this all up as loss of trust in the current Core dev team.
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:06:36
If there are Core devs saying 1mb is already too big then I'd say the fear is justified. Don't you?

Wrong, miners are there to protect us from hostile changes to the code and from the looks if it I'd say it's working as intended. SegWit isn't a done deal. Just cause the most active people on this sub support it doesn't mean it has that support with other users aka the vast majority of users that never us reddit.






You are going into lalaland. If a miner did that then they would create an altcoin and it would have a life if its own. This isn't an issue.

LN is still a dream that was sold to the community as THE SOLUTION. With every passing day it seems to me that the end product will not deliver and then Blockstream will somehow sqeeze itself into the model. At that moment the PR machines will go to heavy work saying how wonderful everything is and Bitcoin banks will be a reality.
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:20:48
It's amusing to see how all the rules are ignored when something is pro-Core. Is this place now an altcoin pumping sub or what happened? Not shady at all.
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:19:03
Don't think so. Most threads on r/btc have some sort of evidence. Like following the money or something. This sub only accuses without providing proof.
@_date: 2017-04-09 08:30:45
Basicly it's a scaling method that promised the same security as Bitcoin's blockchain, but with the transactions being done off-chain with cheaper costs and higher transactions per sec. It's a neat thing if it actualy happened as it was sold to the community.
I personally have a feeling that the end product of LN will not be as it was sold in the beginning. Assuming LN even happens. Worst case cenario is that we will have lightning hubs that are regulated by law, banks technically. Bitcoin transactions will be faster and cheaper, but also strictly tracked by governments etc. LN done wrong can be the best thing ever for the alphabet agencies.

You don't see to understand how long people have waited for a blocksize bump. It isn't a new thing and the debate has gone on for years. These people have seen devs, who supported bigger blocks, get pushed out and vilified. It's no longer about segwit, it's about the loss of trust in Core team.

Now imagine if Bitmain didn't sell hardware that was ASICBOOST viable. How many people would buy this potentialy inferior hardware?
Does this mean they use ASICBOOST? No, it doesn't. 
Does this mean noone uses ASICBOOST? No, but aslong as you have Bitmain hardware, you technically could. 
Just because Bitmain sells top notch hardware that is capable to use ASICBOOST doesn't mean they use it, but what it does mean is that everyone who buys hardware from them could potentially turn on ASICBOOST if it was required. Idk why people lie and claim that this means they use ASICBOOST. It's just a conspiracy.

But it's equally possible that miners will ignore these economically important nodes and those nodes would get forked off instead. I assume that will be the case unless there is a clear consensus on the matter.
@_date: 2017-04-12 09:11:17
It's pretty clear that this will not get the 95%+ support which is supposedly needed for a fork. So are we advocating for a treshhold under 95%?
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:40:27
UASF without miners support will not work. It will have long waiting times between blocks or if the majority of miners decided to mine empty blocks to protest against UASF then the UASF would fail as all of the minority hashrate blocks would be orphaned(doubt this would happen, but it's possible). If this was followed with a hardfork including a PoW change to counter the miners protest then it would likely be the end of Bitcoin and ETH (or something else) would become the new default crypto.
/// Also I don't trust the average user to not be subject to propaganda and UASF would basicly show that you don't need to invest hundreds of millions to take over Bitcoin. All you'd need to do is get some dirt on the most influencial people in Bitcoin and then run a well paid propaganda campaign, maybe costing a few million. The majority would follow like sheep. So no, I don't trust a user who doesn't have real skin in the game. Miners income depends on the success of Bitcoin so I trust them a lot more.

@_date: 2017-04-20 08:25:56
BLOCK SIZE is not being increased. Stop using the term "block size" when talking about segwit, it does nothing about the block size. The difference is same as buying peeled nuts and unpeeled nuts. Both bags are same sized but 1 bag hold more peanuts. Peeling the nuts doesn't make the bag bigger. So no, segwit doesn't raise the block size. it only adds some peeled nuts to the mix of unpeeled nuts. It also doesn't replace all the unpeeled nuts with peeled nuts. I like nuts :D
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:31:31

WTH are you on about? The asic boost drama is no more than an unprooven conspiracy. Since when has it become the default reality?
Miners are also users. Keep this in mind. In most cases they are way bigger users than a group of people. Not even talking about the investments that miners have made into different startups etc. Since when has it become the new norm to bash the people that have invested the most into Bitcoin and related businesses?
And please go sober up, cause this "they tried increasing the block reward" is as crazy as it gets. The lowering supply of new bitcoins is the main reason why the price keeps going up. Changing this would break Bitcoin.

I don't consider skyrocketing fees, functions like RBF etc as a "great job". 
It doesn't matter how many people you have when they all support 1 way of thinking. If you continue pushing out people with different ideas and only include/promote the ones that think like you then in the end you will have a team made of many individuals, but is that alone enough?
Please stop painting Core team as 100 independent thinkers, cause it is patently not the case. There are only a few devs that even try to communicate with the users and if those few say something clearly controversial then the rest of the devs stay silent. The ones who havn't stayed silent have left the project for some reason. Not a good trend if you'd ask me.

As a somewhat EC supporter I don't really see the attacks on BU as a bad thing. The more attackers = the more bugs will be found.

@_date: 2016-09-30 15:14:11
Lisen to it again. He said that both scaling methods are needed and Segwit aswell. The reason he doesn't support hardfork RIGHT NOW is because it would most likely result in a 70/30 split similar to eth. If that wasn't the case I'd imagine him just prefering the cleaner implementation. I'm not a programmer (and neither is he?), but I'm quite sure a softfork version of Segwit would not be the cleaner code. Should probably take his advice and stop with the drama.

It's a shame that people who think like you are currently in charge of Core team. Everything would be so much smoother if you had forked off to a 50kb max block size chain and left Bitcoin alone. Instead of making Bitcoin into an altcoin why not just start your own? It's almost as if the people in charge are not interested in cryptos succeeding, based on the funding sources it wouldn't surprise me.
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:10:29
So you are happy that people aren't using Bitcoin as much as they used to? 
Maybe someone can make a graph on how many Bitcoin transactions there used to be vs altcoins and if/how much  has it changed during the last year or so? 
I for example have stopped using Bitcoin alltogether for my transactions, as it's not a viable means of payment compared to other cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:12:51
altoin transaction amount is going up, Bitcoin is going down. Bitcoin market dominance is falling. So yeah altcoins are getting more valuable  and I'd guess that this will continue.

There is no such responsibility when it comes to Bitcoin. Noone has signed any legal agreements on what client we must/should use. 2x is serving to the needs of the users, Core is not lisening. If Core won't provide users what they want then someone else will. Same applys to 2x.
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:30:32
He is correct. Redditors are only a very small subset of users, if you think that the majority of users won't welcome the 2mb then you are either stuck in a echo chamber or being paid to say stupid shit.

My view is very practical, utility based. Yours is more about faith and conspiracy. If the governement wants to get your wealth then nothing will stop them from doing it. Instead of being a conspiracy nut, try to look at new technologies as means of doing business more effectively. Bitcoin has the potential to become the first international money, which could bypass a fair amount of currecy conversion fees, absurd bank fees etc. Digital gold is so absurd that it it hurts to even think about it!

It's not viable for any payments, other coins outcompete it by a mile when it comes to payments. You'd have to be angry at your money if you plan to use it instead of other cryptos.

To you it's more of a get rich scheme, "buy some coins at 1k and sell them in 10 years for 1mil ea". People like you don't give Bitcoin value. It's people like me who actualy got people to use Bitcoin when doing business, but don't worry I am not longer telling people to look into Bitcoin, but rather cryptos in general.

It's simple. The original idea and vison that got the first people on board isn't what Core is trying to do now and hasn't been for a while. People are pissed off. It would only be fair if Core forked off and focused on their vision, which seems to be "Bitcoin Gold". 
There are still people out there that see the endgame as 1 coin that rules them all and Bitcoin Cash just isn't that coin for them.

You can get fiat in matter of minutes when sending via WU. Sure, btc is cheaper, but can you can't turn bitcoin into fiat in 5 minutes after recieving it. Taken this into consideration then Bitcoin will not have to match WU fees before being worse than WU. If we continue on this path then WU will surely become more useful than Bitcoin. Sure you can still send 10k+ via Bitcoin and pay a lot less fees, but how many people really do such transactons? Maybe 1/100 transactions are that large, I'd imagine that most transactions are under 500$.

All the miners they sell are asicboost viable. Would you buy hardware that wasn't able to run asicboost? No, you wouldn't, you'd buy from the competition that sold miners that supported asicboost. Them selling the best hardware out there, which supports all solutions, isn't a bad thing. They have to do this or buyers would take their business elsewhere. Why are people ignoring this fact?

If all this was true and possible without compromising the security that onchains trnsactions have then I'd be the 1st person to support LN.

Everyone can use it, cause they sell the best hardware out there. This conspiracy was started on the bases that he makes 100m in profit, from asicboost alone. Now that it's prooven that it's more like 2m, which isn't even 1% of the overal profit Bitmain makes, it seems like a bad joke. To risk it all for a less than 1% extra profit would be retarded. Just imagine how easily the covert asicboost would come out. It would only take 1 random worker to do so.

I'm interested in discussing about Bitcoin and right now it was about why we have the 10min per block period. To me it makes sense in a world with bigger blocks.

Should measure how much money is coming into Bitcoin right now and how much came with the last bubble. That would give a sense if we are infact in a bubble.

It will come down as fast as it went up.

If you have a buggy transaction type and you add another transaction type (segwit) then it doesn't make the old one go away. You now have 2 transaction types, old formal, which is still open to attacks and the new format. The attacker will use the old format so as a result segwit doesn't fix quadratic hashing. If we did a hardfork and replaced the old format with segwit then that would fix it.

BItcoin was on its way to becoming the "Paypal of the people", but there was a change of plan at the dev level. The reason is not that it would have been impossible. In all honesty I have no clue(and I'd guess only a handful of people do) what was the real reason behind this massive change of plan, but it's clear as day that every dev that supported the idea of "Paypal of the people" has been pushed out of the Core dev team. 
It's fair to say that Bitcoin was hijacked by the new devs, but I personally believe that this will change. Either Bitcoin will lose out to a competitor or Core will get replaced by people who are willing to lisen to their customers.

Or it can be followed with some bad news and go under the 1500$ mark, which is possible. As the price drops, more people will transfer coins to an exchange and follow the next dump. After Gox Bitcoin lost 3/4 of its peak value, I doubt any exchange would have such a large impact on the price nowdays, but losing 1/2 of the peak value would be in arms reach. Considering that, even 1300$ would be an amazing new floor and the next high could very well be around the 4k mark.

Doesn't really matter about what we'd discuss. Core would still do their own thing and that's why we need multiple implementations. If Core or any other team refuses to code solutions that the users want then another team will do it. The real problem that needs to be solved is having a centralised dev team. We need to fix this asap and after that we will see all sorts of new and interesting upgrades and not just the ones that Core decides that we should have.

LN will only be useful to you if you do a lot of transactions with 1 person. If you don't do that then LN will not save you and if you are the majority of people then the overal fee will not drop. If you need to pay someone, then it would require 2 payments if done via LN and only 1 when done onchain. Using LN will only make sense if you plan on doing 3+ transactions with the person. How large of a % do you think such transactions make? I don't know, but I'd guess that at best it's ~20%. If you now cut down the 20% into 2% then in overal you only get 18% smaller blocks compaired to no LN. In reality I bet this % would be even lower. I don't understand why people refuse to face the facts that LN will offer close to nothing at this state of the game. If we had 100mb blocks then LN would make a lot of sense, but atm it's useless tech.

The limit was added to prevent people from spamming the network back when 0 fee transactions got included in the blockchain. You could in theory add 100mb to the size of the blockchain for free. After the limit it was only 1mb for every 15min. It wasn't an issue back then because the average block size was like 20kb. The limit was added to prevent an attack and not to raise the fees, but Core devs are currently keeping it in place to raise the fee and this is hindering Bitcoin's adoption. Raising the fees wasn't the reason why the limit was added and it was supposed to be risen as Bitcoin's usage grew.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:51:47
Can't you really sense how few people support UASF? This won't be the thing that unites us, if anything then it will split us into 2 groups, pro digital gold Vs pro digital cash and I don't even see it as a bad thing any more. It's clear that there are 2 different visions for Bitcoin and a split will likely happen. 1 chain will follow the digital gold and the other 1 will suck up all the capital from alts that are currently doing what Bitcoin was ment for. Considering that Bitcoin is losing market cap to alts atm then odds are that the digital gold will lose market cap to digital cash aswell.

You are dense in the head if you don't understand that for the average person it's cheaper to spend 100$ to send money via WU than invest the time that it takes to start using Bitcoin. As the fee goes up there will be less motivation for people to start using Bitcoin, cause even if it's cheaper, it will also take a lot more time to turn Bitcoins into fiat. With WU you skip that step. That's why it's "cheaper". Plus in most cases you have to pay like 5% fee to turn Bitcoins into fiat, assuming you are in a hurry.

For now we need adoption and I agree that we need layer 2/3/4 etc, but it's just too early to worry about it. We 1st need to hit the critical mass when it comes to users, after that we'll have more devs and more pressure for layer 2 upgrade. With more users the layer 2 upgrade become viable. With the current userbase they won't see much use, that's the main reason why the progress is so slow.

Don't buy it. The common thing about small blockers is that they expect their less than 10 coins to be worth 1mil each if they just stay quite a follow the party line aka Core propaganda. This is why it feels so 1 sided, you have 1000 people with 100+ coins Vs 20k people with 1 coin. While the 1k people have more invested their voices still yelled over by the horde of lowballers aka twitter trolls.

Did I say that it's large blocks and only larger blocks? I said that for now all we need is larger blocks. The network can take larger blocks. It's been tested with 8mb and even 16mb was supposedly fine. By now I'd guess that the network would handle even 16mb+ blocks easily, if not more.
And no there isn't an infinit demand for blockspace. Do you know how long it took to fill up 1mb blocks? 8mb blocks will buy us enough time, grow the userbase and dev space. This in return will make the demand for 2nd layer solutions higher and make them actualy viable. The current 1mb blocksize limit is hindering adoption amount users and less users means less coders.

It becoming clearer by the day that the whole asicboost story was a hitpiece and has no backbone. If it did then we would have proof other than Bitmain supplying its customers with top notch hardware. Would you, as a customer, buy a miner that wasn't asicboost capable? You'd have to be a fool to do that and Bitmain understands that people who buy miners are no fools and want the best hardware out there. Else they'd go to the competitor.
Since when has a sane business plan turned into "proof" of them running covert asicboost. It's a hitpiece without proof and it's becoming clearer by the day.

I won't even start argueing with someone who's default mindset is that it was some sort of planned backdoor. There is clear documentation that it was supposed to be a feature + the code was open sourced. What else do you need? Was it bad coding on the part of Bitmain, ofcs, noone will argue against it, even Bitmain itself said it was a bug and they patched it. But this notion as if it was a planned attack on the part of Bitmain is nothing more than a conspiracy theory which this sub doesn't seem to lack when it comes to propaganda against bigger blocks.

So Asicboost could in theory be worth 100mil per year in the future, but currently is more around 2mil per year. I'd still say that it wouldn't be worth running asicboost for PR reasons. In future it might make more sense if there is 100mil profit to be made(by then I doubt it would be just Bitmain who'd think about running it though), but accusing Bitmain of using covert Asicboost atm isn't justified by the numbers.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:15:36

Cool story, too bad Bitcoin only holds a few bil of wealth and no the 30bil market cap doesn't mean there is 30bil invested into Bitcoin. For example, if Satoshi suddenly dumped all of his coins at once then the market cap would not go down by 2bil, it would go down more than 20bil.
And ponzi as in the promise of a 100k per bitcoin to lure new people that will push up the price while Bitcoin becomes more troublesome to use. It just doesn't feel right to me.
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:19:12
How many people send 100000? Saying you can send 100000 via Bitcoin while most people send less than 500$ isn't really an argument. Once Bitcoin fees go to like 3-5$ then WU will be more useful as you get fiat in matter of minutes, not the case with Bitcoin.

The potential profit is not worth the risk. Claiming they use asicboost is just nonsense and there surely would be some ex-worker to turn them in by now if it was the case. The whole asicboost thing was way overblown by twitter trolls.

This will require a lot bigger blocks. LN will only become viable once people start using it in a daily mannor, when shopping on ebay,paying taxes, groceries etc. Currently the was majority of transactions are p2p 1 time payments and if we did those via LN then it would take more space and more fees than doing the 1 time payments onchain. Hopefully you do understand this problem.

By the time we'd hit 8gb blocks it might still just take a 10k $ PC to run a full node. Sure, it wouldn't be able with the current 10k PC, but we don't have 8gb blocks atm or do we? It took years to reach 1mb, will take a lot more to reach 1gb or 8gb and technology will get better+cheaper as we progress.
Conclusion: It's still possible.

Please do yourself a favour and read about how profitable is Asicboost and how much Bitmain could make from using it and how much they'd risk if it came out. The 100m per year is a bold lie and in reality the profit would be about 50x less. They have a lot more to lose if people stopped buying their hardware, which is their most profitable business.
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:28:03
People going full drama mode over Wu pointing out that you don't need a multi million dollar datacenter to scale Bitcoin to Visa levels, a 10k PC would do the job. If he is correct then I see this as a great thing and not worth all this drama. If people think that going from 1m to 8mb means you have to buy a 10k PC then Bitcoin is RIP. Very tech savy people...
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:00:01
To a whole 1.7mb :O 
8mb was safe years ago. I'd imagine that by now the network can operate with up to 32mb blocks. And no this doesn't mean we will see 32mb blocks tomorrow, maybe in 5+ years.
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:46:56
Bitcoin, the global payment system, has value for everyone, even if this includes centralised server farms with 1gb+ blocks. The main aspects of Bitcoin would still stand even if nodes are mostly ran by governments. I personally would want them to try it, cause with mass adoption there would be a lot more crypto savy users. If governments tried messing with the fundamentals(21m coin limit etc) then people would just fork away from their version. A centralised version of Bitcoin, the global payment system, would still be a lot more useful than the current Bitcoin. 
I really don't understand when people forgot about the real value behind Bitcoin. For me it was and will be about replacing the current fiat system. Once we achieve that, then we can start thinking about digital gold, although we wouldn't need to at that point. It feels as if the current Core devs are already prepairing for failure instead of dreaming big. How can people not see that once cryptos go mainstream with mass adoption then it would be the end of the current fiat system. There would be no reason for people to go back to the old system. For that we need to hit critical mass and if LN gets use there then great, but I know for a fact that bigger block will get us there 100%. With bigger blocks we would likely have to sacrify a large chunk from the current state of decentralisation, atleast for this version of Bitcoin. But this would be just the start. 
Lets go back to dreaming big and coding for success instead of failure.
@_date: 2017-05-14 07:17:10

Bitcoin's growth has been artificially limited by the small blocks. At this point we should still put everything into hitting the critical mass and after that we can try these "maybe" solutions like SW+LN. Bigger blocks will do the job 100%, SW+LN is a maybe and will still require a blocksize increase. Keeping the blocksize small at the current stage of Bitcoin is nothing more than insanity.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:44:06
That Bitcoin will have segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:23:11
Once governments start promoting crypto then it will quickly move outside of their reach. They can try to control Bitcoin, but they will fail as they fail with everything.
Cryptos have not reached the critical mass yet and I want to make this as easy as possible. Bigger blocks won't add any new requirements for newcommers and will be great for adoption in short term and long term. LN is a maybe, bigger blocks would be a sure thing and I'm not willing to gamble on this.
You seem to think as if everything will be at their extreme end. The choice isn't between 100% decentralised vs 100% in governments mercy. It would just mean that an average person, who in in dept and has noting to "protect", would not be able to run a node and he wouldn't be interested in doing so anyways. Why would he, he lives from payday to payday. This still leaves a good chunk of population who are able to run a node, which is plenty.
Can we stop with the fairytail that "decentralization" is the magical thing that gives Bitcoin its value. The value comes from people putting fiat into Bitcoin and aslong as it's impossible to make easy and cheap global payments with Bitcoin then this won't change. Fiat coming into Bitcoin will remain the driving force behind rising price. Decentralization will not add value to Bitcoin. Making Bitcoin easier and cheaper to use will add more value than the ability to run a node on your phone. You must understand this simple logic. No matter how decentralized Bitcoin gets, it will add no value to the vast majority of people. Sure, we will lose some people to crytos like Zcash, but in the long term it will be nothing as those few people don't add any serious value. Like it or not, but most people are not anti-government tryhards and actualy somewhat like the current system.
I actualy use Bitcoin when doing business and the fees are really starting to hurt. I don't think of Bitcoin as an investment that will make me rich if I just hold it. I want to keep on using Bitcoin to do business and if Bitcoin price keeps going up as more people start using it then I'd welcome it with open hands. I loved the days when I could tell people to look into Bitcoin cause of the instant transactions, no chargebacks, low fees, being your own bank etc. I can't do this any more and I'm wondering how much longer can I even keep using Bitcoin as a means of payment, cause the fees are really getting out of hand.

Asicboost is a none issue. The real profit that would be made from it would not outweight the risk of getting caught. Imagine how much bad press a company would get if it came out that they used it. Especially if the main revenue for the company was selling hardware. It would not be worth risking 100mil+ just to make 2mil more per year.
@_date: 2017-05-18 10:40:47
Miners can activate a fork whenever they wish. It doesn't mean that users and companies will follow, so I'll disagree with your statement that it doesn't apply to all 4 options.
Miners are a subset of users, they aren't a different group on their own. Just so you'd know, miners still hold a lot of the coins that they have mined, they don't sell everything the moment they mine some. If they did then I'd agree on them being a different group from users.
@_date: 2017-05-17 11:06:43
Please read this 
If you are really interested in how much/little Bitmain would make from running asicboost then you'll read. They have a lot more to lose from bad press and if people stopped buying their hardware as they make more from it than from the mining business. If they didn't then why would they even sell miners. Wouldn't it make more sense to just mine and let everyone else use inferior miners?

I'm pretty sure the 15min period between blocks and the estimated block size are correlated. You wouldn't need 15min between blocks if your intention was to keep blocks small. If Satoshi had intented for the blocks to stay small then he wouldn't have made it so that new blocks take ~10-15min to find. If he had then 1-2min or less would have been plenty.
@_date: 2017-05-05 11:59:41

Does the 10min for a block make sense when we have small blocks or would it rather make sense to have that time period for bigger blocks? The answer is obvious.

It will just get harded to get people interested in Bitcoin as fees go to the MOON. But if we had Bitcoin with low fees and enough capacity then the WU offices would be replaced by Bitcoin ATMs. Running a Bitcoin ATM requires users and to get those users we need more capacity. Bitcoin has the potential to replace WU, but if we continue on the current path then I can see Bitcoin as a way to transfer large amounts of wealth at a time, but it will not replace WU in any significant way. That's not the Bitcoin I signed up for tbh.

You might call it shady, but I have over 3000 postive feedbacks there and guess what, noone has been ripped off by me. If you go on any marketplace and buy from someone with 1 feedback then expect to get scrued. My advice to all the haters would be to buy from sellers that have high rep. This logic works on g2a marketplace and pretty much everywhere in life. G2a does not have 1 seller, there are sellers with 500k+ feedback and if they were in the business of scamming others then their account would have been disabled a long time ago. As a seller on g2a I know that they take this shit seriously. 
Also they allow withdrawals to webmoney and webmoney can easily be exchanged for bitcoins WITHOUT any risks (this is what I do). 
The last thing I have to say about g2a is that their live support is the best I have used. This comes from someone who has been in the online selling/buying business for a good 6 years. No live support has come close to theirs. If anything then I'd say their security is a tad bit too much. Logging in from a new IP can get your account locked quite easily.

But for some reason the current devs, who got into Bitcoin too late to have bought/mined significant amount of bitcoins or devs who lost their coins on gox etc, are refusing to leave. Because they just want the best for us common folks. I don't buy this. It stinks of foul play.
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:28:50
Governments can still ban Bitcoin, no matter what the blocksize is. Internet service providers can be forced to report everyone who even googles the term Bitcoin, not even talking about running a node. That's a more likely cenario than Bitcoin taking a huge chunk from the store of value market. Governments will not stand still as a large chunk of value gets moved outside of the system and I'd guess the effect on Bitcoin will not be great and can possibly make it worth nothing.
Also the tracking tools are only getting better and as time passes it will be easier to identify people who hold significant amount of coins. You might say that this isn't going to happen and I'd agree that in the current climate it won't, but if you'd add a civil war within Europe or a larger war with N-korea to the mix then the odds get higher.

Just pointing out that average people use Bitcoin mostly and not everyone is a millionare who sends 100 000$ per transaction. Fees will never go high enough to justify sending 100 000$ via WU, cause people will stop using Bitcoin before that and just send it via wire or something. "100 000$ can be send via Bitcoin at a margin fee" will most likely stand forever, but if you replace the 100k with 500$ then the argument wont stand for long, even with 1000$ it will be outpriced comparied to other options. Remittance via Bitcoin is not going to happen at this pace, some other coin might get the business instead.

Nope, it was never the aim for everyone to run a node. The vast majority of people are basicly in dept and don't need a store of value. They don't need to run a full node and people claiming otherwise are plain morons when it comes to life (doesn't matter how good programmers they are or how many degrees they have). 
There is a very small minority of people who have enough assets to invest heavily into Bitcoin and they will run a node to protect their investment. Most people live from paycheck to paycheck and should not care about running a node. It's a waist of resources for them to run a node and you'd have to be a well wishing moron to not see this.
@_date: 2017-05-18 12:41:22

You don't have to reach blocksize limit for the bidding war to begin. If the network can only handle 10mb blocks, but the limit is set at 100mb, then there won't be 10mb+ blocks else miners would risk getting their block orphaned. The point of bigger blocks and ~constant income from fees is that miners can continue to operate without huge spikes or drops in their income. The current spiking fee is unsustainable if you expect new users to join. 
Also bigger blocks don't mean no L2 scaling, L2 will see usage once there are enough use cases for it. Currently the main transactions are 1 time payments and if we used LN for those type of transactions then we'd have to do 2 payments instead. Once Bitcoin is widely accepted in all sorts of stores then LN will see usage, but there just isn't much demand for those type on transactions atm.
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:55:12
Different from you I actualy use WU as a means of payment and don't have to rely on theory. Since most people don't know how to turn Bitcoins into fiat or how to do it quickly then as a result very few people like being paid in Bitcoin. I have even stopped suggesting Bitcoin to my average customers, cause the fees have gone up 10x+ in a short time and if this continues then it won't be that cost efficient for them. If you add in the hassle of learning about how to store Bitcoin and how to turn them into fiat then Bitcoin really does lose its shine. For large scale returning customers I still suggest using Bitcoin, but idk for how long that will last.
You seem to not get it that for an average person it's easier to pay 50-100$ WU fee instead of learning on how to use Bitcoin. With the raising fees the situation just gets worse and no they don't give a flying fuck about being able to run a node. 
Idk why I even spend time responding to someone who clearly doesn't use Bitcoin to do business and only talks out of their arse.
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:17:50
Big blocks are the most straight forward way to scale. No matter what fancy technologies will be implemented the blocksize will still have to be  risen. There is no other way and even the Core devs understand this. If there is a way to "scale up hundreds or thousands of times in capacity to achieve mainstream adoption" via 2nd layer then it will happen and the main chain will have less stress on it as a result. For now bigger blocks are tested and viable method to scale Bitcoin. This will make it possible to hit the critical mass for Bitcoin and to the MOON we go.

Just do it, split away with segwit and if it really is such a great thing then people and miners will follow. I'd happily dump my UASF coins so you can buy them cheap. Just do it!

No, it isn't. Step outside of the echochamber please.

Buy the rumor, sell the news. That's how markets work :)

Ofcs, bugged out, yet a large chunk of the network run them. This is why I can't take someone like you seriously, cause you are on your high horse and either lack the ability to sense reality or willfully ignore it.
You can say stuff like "BU,XT,Classic etc are dead", but it will not change the fact that for example 40% of hash rate is directed at BU. 
Just so you'd shut up about the quadratic hashing. SegWit does not fix it. It only adds a new transaction type. The old format will still be there and it's open to attacks, as unlikely as it is, but it's still there.

Gl with your altcoin. I will stay on the more secure chain.
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:30:23
Well speculation will likely keep both chains alive, just like ETH and ETC. Both are quite useless, but alive and kicking.

How long til the asicboost conspiracy dies? Does any sane person really believe this 100m fairytail? Use your heads, if it was so profitable, then everyone would be using it.

I have a buy offer set for 1st of August, that's about all I think of it.
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:15:06
I'm more than sure that there would be an easy solution to prevent governments from doing it(even if we only had a few dozen nodes, which isn't realistic) or there would be other goverments that would green light everything Bitcoin as a middle finger to the ones trying to ban it.
And even if every government agreed to shut down Bitcoin then I don't think it would be impossible to implements a system where the blockchain is split up into 100s of pieces and stored all over the world in a way that you can use cryptocraphy to confirm that they have not been edited. Not an expert, but this doesn't seem like something that can't be done.
@_date: 2017-05-29 07:53:47
So you don't even have 10 bitcoin but act as you're a top tier Bitcoiner. People like you make me laugh, but it follows the trend that small blockers don't really use Bitcoin and don't need to worry about the insane fees as a result.
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:25:12
Funny, because most big blockers are the early members. The new members mostly have ~1btc and expect the price to skyrocket with limiting the blocksize and making Bitcoin into digital gold. You don't seem to understand what you signed up for, cause I was perfectly fine with having datacentres that run nodes. If you want a crippled crypto with small blocksize then feel free to fork. Bitcoin was not designed to have a 1mb limit on it. It was only added to prevent people from spamming back when you could send transactions with NO FEE. This is no longer possible as miners don't include 0 fee transactions. Small blockers are the lambo guys, not the big blockers. Please don't get this mixed up. Bigger blocks = more utility = more value for me.

Reply to the argument and stop the nitpicking.
Does the 10min for a block make sense when we have small blocks or would it rather make sense to have that time period for bigger blocks? The answer is obvious.
///and if you want to know why i used the 15min, it's because for me that's how long it has usually taken for me, 10-15min.
@_date: 2017-05-01 09:46:06
Then we would just fork or they would fork and we'd have 2 coins.
Your vision of Bitcoin is something that is unusable for the vast majority of people. A plaything of the elites. My vision is something different and involves the majority of people, even the ones living in 3rd world shitholes. Yes, it would have downsides, but idc about that. If the devs really thought their plan of keeping blocksize as small as possible is worth something then they could and should start their own coin with a 300kb blocksize limit. That's not what I signed up for.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:22:03
Since when did the number of nodes start mattering so much? Anyone can set up 100+ nodes with little cost. They don't do this, because it's useless and doesn't give them anything, but as soon as we start thinking of the node counter as a significant measurement then we have a problem. 
The moment when running a node becomes important is the moment when people will start doing it in hordes, but advertising running a node as "important for Bitcoin", cause of bip148, is stupid and reckless, cause node counter can easily be manipulated. This can't be done with hash rate and that's why hash rate is and will be king. 
Want to make BItcoin more secure and harder to manipulate? Buy some hardware and start mining/voting. Advertising a cheap method to bypass the mining aspect is reckless and moronic for the security of the network. I don't even mind if bip148 ends with a split, if it gets the node counting folks out of the main project. Go set up as many nodes as you wish, I will follow the most secure chain.

It's cause there are so many people who think "investing into Bitcoin" &lt;-&gt; "being smart" and don't want to face that it's more like 
"investing into Bitcoin" &lt;- "being smart" 
and 
"investing into Bitcoin" -&gt; "being smart" rarely if ever applies. 
Reality is that it's a high risk, high reward investment and I can talk from experience. I have a ~3x return with this investment, when measured in Bitcoin it's more like 2x. I understand the potential that Bitcoin has, but I can also see it ending up worthless. I usually keep my Bitcoin assets equaly split between Fiat and Bitcoin, but not atm. Too much air in the current price so I'm on the sidelines with my 3x fiat return for now. Even if Bitcoin price skyrockets(2000$+) right now then I will be happy with my profits, but I sense a massive correction incoming and all I can say is "buy the dip". Going to throw out some numbers aswell for the lols. I personally think we'll bottom to 13xx$ soon, but I also fear that I'm being a bit optimistic about the bottom. That said it wouldn't amaze me if we actualy went under 1000$ again and stayed there for a while as there would be a lot of bad press over the suicides after such a correction.
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:17:21
It's actualy not nonsense. He is sort of correct as Luke has said that HF is a horrible idea, but at the same time he is talking of HFing and even changing the PoW. That's called a double standard.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:16:32
Already did, but for some reason the current Core devs are trying to change it with an artificial fee market etc. The market will prevail, I'm sure of it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 10:28:53
I want a secure blockchain, would not accept a chain with less than 75% hash and this is why a UASF aka Sybil attack will not fly with me.
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:50:13
Sorry, still sleeping. Bitcoin is currently handcapped by Core software, time to remove the handicap/Core and I'll happily bid for a place on the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:25:01
The argument still stands if it's 10min or 15min. Plus I somewhat corrected myself with the 10-15min range that I gave before you came in on your high horse. I also explained why I used the 15min. You have yet to respond to my argument and are still nitpicking on the constant, which is obvious trolling. I'm not even writing this to make you change your mind, just doing it so others could read what sort of a troll you are.
@_date: 2016-07-07 06:15:03
The reason they dropped it was because my countries IRS wanted to double charge every bitcoin transaction. Buy 1000€ worth of btc, then the seller has to pay 210€ in sales tax. So please do stfu if you know nothing about the issue.

Why do people upvote these? I get it that the halving added a few pump&amp;dumpers, but seriously... These posts about "the price skyrocketing any moment now" are some real fine shitposts. I came here for informative posts, not this shit.

Some people really need to stop this hate on coinbase. For a casual reader who used coinbase without any issues(before my country was dropped from supported countries) this really seems like a big pile of horseshit. Just makes this subreddit look bad. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:09:06
No, it doesn't. It only does that if you use segwit transaction type. It doesn't remove the old transaction format aka malleability bug.
