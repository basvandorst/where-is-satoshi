Isn't that a really improbable?

Check Daniel Quinn for similar work but in more novelized forms.

Gotta love a post with the pitch "skirting gambling regulations" 
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:55:51
This is what andreas antonopoulos highlighted recently on the Joe rogan podcast. I highly recommend it for bitcoiners new and old.

I would say about half or more people working with bitcoin are primarily interested in this. Nobody is stopping you from doing this, however nobody is stopping the value to plummet overnight. I wouldn't recommend it. However aside from being a bad financial ploy it's not in the spirit of what we're trying to do here. Sure enough people can get 'rich' off bitcoin but personally the true value lies in its transference. Use it as you would any other currency and as a result of this among thousands others will cause its value to rise. So, win-win situation for you and me.

No but lots of bundle sites do, and recently  just opened its doors to Btc. So there's definitely a precedent in this realm.

Thanks I'm coming into this thread blind about the current news.

Truly a fable for the ages.

Welcome, I'd tip you if I had any magic Internet money in the tip bot

Spread it around and sponsor proper projects.

Is there any audio of him saying bitcorn? I'd love to sample it.

It's a term in film to represent something very integral to the plot and that the characters care so deeply about but really when you stop and think about it, either it doesn't really make sense, or it really doesn't have a huge impact on the larger world. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:01:20
Well now I'm just curious AND hungry! 
@_date: 2014-07-18 03:24:45
Supernintendo Lawsky sure living up to his character.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:26:52
Apparently word is he was shadowbanned. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:56:04
Do you have further reading or information about? I'd like to know more. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 03:27:04
This is crazy, but soooo fascinating and intriguing! Who is doing the ddos attack? What do they have to gain? Or are they just enemies of bitcoin? Or trying to cause a price drop? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:06:13
Does he get you kitty Frappuccinos? 
@_date: 2014-01-30 14:36:40
This is super special awesome, huzzah!
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:31:14
Because.... They're nice people who believe in bitcoin and feel it deserves free advertising? 
@_date: 2014-01-30 12:55:56
Should have put a silly hat on him
@_date: 2014-01-30 12:55:11
Ah so the trick is to put on something bleeding edge before banks catch on that it's a 'thing' 
@_date: 2014-01-07 14:51:30
I've always been interested in art and visualization revolving around "The Blockchain." Kudos for you and your inspiration; I hope in the future to do some paintings and other multimedia work surrounding the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-01-30 12:51:59
True, but just remember to excersise your lefts so you don't get imbalanced and too strong on one side of the body 
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:47:31
Wow this breakdown helps immensely!
@_date: 2014-01-30 12:59:30
Are there any reputable viable ASIC miners or even companies one could point to that aren't pulling this sort of stuff, yet still producing a viable product in relation to current difficulty 
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:24:54
BitVampires only appear in BitMirrors
@_date: 2012-09-10 19:03:27
What does this mean by 'washed'? Laundered?
@_date: 2012-09-09 03:49:05
In the same veins they went after Megaupload. I don't know how it'd affect Mt. Gox. And I realize bitcoin technology lends itself to avoiding stuff like this; but still they'll try as best they can.
@_date: 2012-09-09 14:39:16
Hey I'm not saying their tactics are effective or even worthwhile but they will do what they think they can. 
@_date: 2012-09-09 03:28:35
It's been a fun run but I really believe there's going to be some legislation and/or mandates related to bitcoin within the next presidents term.
@_date: 2012-09-22 14:41:22
Yeah, um, why don't you explain what the reward drop is for... *other* people
@_date: 2011-09-12 18:38:37
I believe for your second comment they wrote Instapaper. Although this isn't the best solution as it's cloud-based.. instapaper encourages printing or backing up of what you save to read it later; so...something like that.

Can someone summarize NPR's thoughts and opinions or at least the main argument of the piece?
@_date: 2016-07-22 00:06:00

Can i do this without a kill a watt?
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:54:09
You're just going to wear out your computer components that way. I don't know exactly where the difficulty is at but I doubt you'd earn ten cents a day if that. Mine something other than Btc
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:49:08
It doesn't mean they want to work "with" bitcoin. They surely want to take advantage of it, but I doubt they'll integrate it past this alternative investments that seem to cover lots of strange things. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:34:09
Can you elaborate on this a little more?
