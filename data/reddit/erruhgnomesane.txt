I don't technically need the transaction reversed though, I just need to change the address that I put down. Everything about the order is correct except the address line, is there no way to just edit an existing order? I definitely agree with the rest of the comments I'm very confused as to why Bit Instant hasn't sent me any kind of email questioning why the money never got delivered since the address was invalid.

Ok cool that's what I'm hoping.  I haven't heard back from Bit Instant yet so hopefully once they see the error they will contact me.  I know it was a really dumb mistake on my part so I don't expect any miracles, if the money is gone then lesson learned, but I am hoping that I can work something out with Bit Instant since the coins have been paid for but the address is wrong.

Any idea how long a while is? I was planning on using the coins this week and I'm also concerned that since they've already got my money that my problem will just pushed farther and farther down to the bottom. I'm sorry if I sound naive but my money won't just dissappear and be impossible to find eventually will it? Because the only documentation I have is all from ZipZap I have nothing from Bit instant. Thank you for your speedy response btw

Ok thanks so much for your help. Last question I promise: my money is safe right? I'm both concerned and surprised that the site would let me enter an invalid Bit Coin address. Obviously it was my fault but I don't understand why during this whole process I never once received an error message or something so im confused as to where exactly my money went

I put down my home address instead of my Bit Coin address
Edit: just to be more specific I selected Bit Coin address from the drop down bar and then put down my home address in the line that says Bit Coin address
