We use roughly the same payout method that Spotify uses.
Readers are paid according to this equation (readers upvotes/total readers upvotes)*(total site revenue/6)
We are currently trying to attract readers, so we can't say what an average reader makes per week yet.  But the hope is that like musicians on Spotify or drivers for Uber, readers will be able to make good money reading in their spare time, or full time if they are popular enough.

Audio gets voted on by the listeners and the higher the votes the more it moves up the page.  So it's more or less self regulating.

We could do that but then we would have to hold the readers accountable in some way, say you need a certain number of submissions per week to keep your account active.
We are hoping for readers to be completely independent, like Uber drivers, work whenever you want, get paid only for the work you do.

There is a free trial with offer code "TRIAL".  The pay out is based on how popular your readings are, so it will vary, but the goal is for readers to be able to earn significant money like an Uber driver would.

In what way?

Audball is trying to turn the written internet into the spoken internet for people who don't have time to read themselves or just prefer to listen.  We are a bitcoin only company and pay people in bitcoin to read from our partnering publications.
If you want to earn bitcoin in your spare time then sign up for an audball account and click "become a reader!" at the bottom.

Hmmm.... indeed.
Right now we are trying to attract readers.  Readers are paid in bitcoin based on how many "upvotes" their readings get compared to other readers.
We have partnered with Lewrockwell.com, mises.org and other popular libertarian sites to supply the content.  We just need readers right now to supply the audio.

I wish I could give a good estimate but the goal is for readers to supplement their income like they would if they were driving for Uber.
They payout is a function how how popular the reader is compared to the other readers.  This is how Spotify pays their artists.

I updated the blurb at the bottom to say it basically how you just explained it!

Recorders maybe?

Thank You! I'll will do that.  FEE is on my top ten but no one returned my emails there.  I'm sure FEEs inbox is a job to sift through though so I'm not surprised.

Yes, the articles are curated in one location.  For each article any number of readers can submit audio.  Listeners can up/downvote each reading so that the best moves to the top.  Readers get paid based on these votes.
The audio is hosted by SoundCloud and we recommend Audacity(free) to record your audio.  After you sign up to read we send you a 5 minute video that shows in detail what recording editing and uploading looks like.
