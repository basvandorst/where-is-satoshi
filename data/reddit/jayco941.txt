I'm on the same boat, BIP148 is the way to go. I changed my server over 6-8 months ago and haven't looked back.

I just went through and compared Hal Finneys speaking characteristics to Satoshis. Just looking for the some what distinct phrase "screwed up" or "screw up" is a common term between the two or one person. I'm sure others can find similarities if searched. Grammar usage between the two is very similar as well. Take that as you will.
Satoshi - "Very much not.  Using multiple copies of wallet.dat is not recommended or supported, in fact all of Bitcoin is designed to defeat that.  Both copies will get screwed up."
Satoshi - " It still lets them, it just screws up if they do."
Satoshi - "Is VC trying to use precompiled headers and screwing it up?"
Satoshi - "You can always delete blk*.dat if it gets screwed up and let it re-download."
Satoshi - "If the second version screwed up"
HF - "The thread links are screwed up after the first two messages; skip to:"
HF - "Sorry! I did screw up the encoding."

I kind of wish I would have purchased somewhere else, I've heard of some sites that deliver in no time at all - I'm not planning on playing the market but not having the bitcoin in my pocket worries me. A lot could happen in 10 days :/

Wow this is great. I am still laughing.

I know /bitcoin isnt a support forum I was simply wondering if others were experiencing this

Interesting... Well hopefully everything works out smoothly and the value continues to go up in the next week or so.

I don't know if I'm liking coin base. The instant verification was nice compared to places like MTGox. However, I bought in a few days ago and my bit coins are going to arrive the 2nd of next month. Wtf? If my bank was insta-verified why do the transfers take so long? Also there prices are always marked above Mtgox by 20-40 USD. What's up with that? I hear about people making instant buys and sells through Coinbase, any explanations?
