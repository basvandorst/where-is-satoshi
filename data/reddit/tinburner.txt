The link for "merged mine," is broken - "1. The Sidechain is merged mined (with the Mainchain as PoW-Parent)."

I would love a 2hr special. I would need a conclusion though. If they left it hanging I would not be pleased.

"Leech" was harsh...
You probably do pay more in taxes. By no means am I in the 1%, however it would be dishonest of me to say I identify with the 99%.
I understand, without explanation, that you pay a significant amount of tax on what I assume is a nice chunk of assets - that you have rightly earned, through hard work and merit. Work that most others could not do. I even understand the feeling that should be paid.
We just disagree on the steps/actions to reform gov't/taxes.

My personal belief is Gavin wanted to believe because it backed his fork argument. What he wanted to see, he saw.
@_date: 2016-05-08 01:02:18
What book? I may be dumb. Someone once told me 10% f my ideas are genius. The other 90% crazy. The problem was he could never tell which idea was which.
What am I missing?
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:46:26
Who cares if no one was hurt. It's about correcting an injustice. 
Injustice angers me, and others, to the point of fanaticism. Don't ask me why.
The whammy of this is, Gavin runs a crypto security protocol. Who was then scammed using techniques he should have known.
And if you see this as a character attack... why? He ACTED. He made bad decisions. What part of that is character related?
Damage done: Gavin lost his credibility. JVP did too. So did Matonis. And BicoinBelle. Dave Kleiman's family is now in the limelight and possibly a target of extortion.
Why are you angrily defending someone who got scammed? How do you know Gavin did give Craig root access to bitcoin? You need to protect the system and not defend the actors.

In short, the media. Just because the Bitcoin community has enough technical know how to spot bs in the media. This has been happening in finance, current events, political coverage, etc forever. People in those communities could spot it, but di any of us? Nope.
It's just more acute to our know how to see it was bs form the start. Not everyone has that capability (technical or logically).
As for Ethrium and other "roll your own chains." I know its not poupular opinion, however, my belief is Bitcoin will not benefit form first mover status. And yes, other blockchains will come out that have better security, better proofs, better scalability, etc.
No business will ever use Bitcoin if 51% of the community decides to be nefarious. Would you use Chase bank to hold your life savings if all it took was 51% of the other account holders to say, "na, wdo as we say or everyone loses everything, worldwide." No way. Bitcoin is a consumer app. That is a mistake if they want to be a currency.
@_date: 2016-05-05 01:00:48
Agree on all fronts. What's wrong with Bitcoin being another commodity on the market of commodities. Gold doesn't hate Silver.
@_date: 2016-05-05 20:34:00
As I read it, and understand it, the headline is not correct.
Basically what is being done is allowing a judge to issue a search warrant for devices whose location is unknown.
If you use Tor, a search warrant is not automatically issued. If you come under investigation, in that investigation the police find some reasonable suspicion you are committing crimes, they can request a search warrant for your device.
In the past, the device's jurisdiction would have to be located first, the jurisdiction clarified, then the warrant issued. 
Now, the court can issue a warrant without knowing the jurisdiction, only AFTER the crime has been found to reasonably have been committed on the device (NOT if it uses TOR).
To me, this seems logical.
However, it seems though the US gov't is now able to reverse crack Tor to find a device if this legislation would be useful.

Have you ever watched American Greed? It's amazing what a scammer will do to avoid reality. It's beyond my grasp how they can continue scamming when they know it's all falling down - they are motivated to scam harder, not give up the ruse. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 13:53:41
While I do not disagree with his hopeful sentiment - I do take issue with his logic.
If a company makes $1bn based on it's users, the company has a vested interest to retain the users - hence you SHOULD trust the company. The more the company makes on your trust, the more validation it has (users who pay), thus more trustworthy.
@_date: 2016-05-11 20:05:15
I do not think I am more honorable. It probably makes me a fool.
However, I believe in fairness. I believe the law does not reflect the fairness that I require of a sound legally taxed system. If I was able to create that system, I would not look kindly on someone taking in the benefits of a taxed system while not paying their taxes.
I am simply stating that Erik is acting unfairly - legal or not.

I see ebay as a marketplace for one-to-one connections between users. Not a one-to-company transaction - which requires trust in the company (if I pay will they ship; if shipment is bad will they replace or return).
One of the things the whole Satoshi debacle reminded me of, was his genius in understanding the human economic motivators in markets. The tweet above just seems "poser-ish" to me - some grand statement that feels true, but makes no sense.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:56:18
The internet goes both ways.
Arguing over details is nice sometimes as well.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:47:08
Yup. He is building up reaosnable doubt to present at his tax fraud hearing. He needs to prove he was using super computers for R&amp;D, and this would be the perfect cover.
That said, I would assume the real Satoshi, whoever that is, would most likely be in a tax fraud situation, as they were motivated to create bitcoin, which is essentially tax evasion.
@_date: 2016-05-05 19:49:16
Ha, sorry. ok.... it was exaggerated.
I was just trying to say that we all make mistakes, but that statement breaks down for mistakes at this scale (another couple scales up would be Irag/Bush).
@_date: 2016-05-05 22:36:17
Yup. I read that as someone explaining to their family why they keep working for a cult/pyramid scheme/etc...
Why would the trustee of the Tulip fund auction off her time? To regale people of Satoshi? Or workshop how to be a good trustee?
The auctioning is just beyond words. What?
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:02:08
Reading other peoples description of her, yes she is a groupie. She has not created "content" in the form of code, analysis, design, sales,  etc to a project in Bitcoin. 
Groupies can also be guys, Matonis for example. JVP too - though maybe to lesser extent.
@_date: 2016-05-08 01:01:13
haha. Thank you. The woman's insults felt personal.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:20:27
The implied concept of Bitcoin makes it so it is not a gov't auth'd currency. So by extension, all transactions are not taxed thatneed to be taxed. So the platform itself creates tax avoidance (sales tax, income tax, tax credits, etc).
I am just stating the law, not stating my personal belief's. 
@_date: 2016-05-14 04:24:11
Are you playing devil's advocate? Do you really feel that way about taxes? I would actually like to know what society looks like to you with a legal code that equates tax to theft. 
My "benefits" are purely theoretical. I was simply stating that the morality of the action can be viewed independent of the tax code. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:44:08
Ha, I dig Bitcoin. I respect Edison and Tesla. I love new inventions (I tinker). I'm was just trying to make a simple point, sorry it went askew.
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:30:22
Well, while agree with the sentiment, I do not agree with what you say in context of the current state of affairs. 
Whether Erik was doing something shady, or doing what he mentions above, he is avoiding USA taxes. I pay my USA taxes in full. So basically Erik is getting the benefits of the USA (economics/security) while not paying his full share - like I am.
Simply put - he is a leech. And I don't like leeches.

Dave Kleiman's name is only associated to Satoshi via CSW leaks - leaked by CSW.
There is no proof Kleiman is Satoshi. None.
@_date: 2016-05-03 15:57:44
Is there a write up on suspects and how many collaborators there were using "Satoshi?"
I am very, very new to the mythology and have enjoyed reading up on it. As I have read the archive of Satoshi's old emails and forum comments, I can see two people's thought processes in the writing's; a big picture guy with some dev chops, and a hard code developer with no big picture chops. I would be curious if this is a common thought in the conspiracy theory community.
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:07:39
Hadn't thought of this. Maybe CSW did invent bitcoin, but the guy presenting himself is not CSW.
Wowsers. 
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:01:16
Why say this?
He should not have commit access. Him saying "it's not a big deal," makes it a big deal.
No way he has commit access. Period.
One. He is not a core developer. Only active Core devs should have commit rights.
Two. He has said Saoshi can have access to the code. He is not trustworthy to make that decision, as shown.
Three. He doesn't get to choose - the Core devs do. In reality, all Bitcoin owners should vote.
4th. Bitcoin is a commodity, not a currency. The revolution will be bitcoin inspired, but not bitcoin
have you given access to CSW?
have you received money, or given money to CSW?
how did Satoshi bless you to be the lead after her exit?
in a clear message support your desire to have or to have no access to Core code.

Interesting read. My first thought was Mt. Gox. What if there really is 2.2 million bitcoins in his possession; AND that amount has already been spent.
We may all see, and believe the money is there, but in actuality, these two, being the only ones who could, coded in a resting state for the account balance, and moved the funds immediately.
Now they could have used the bitcoin to transfer to USD back in 2009/10/11/12. The reason they kept the fixed bitcoin total shown in Satoshi's account was to continually use those bitcoins to transfer to USD at better, future, rates whenever they wanted. Free money.
Tinfoil hat was on, and plugged in.

If you treat it as an asset holding (stocks, commodities, etc). If you pay for an ice cream cone you have to pay sales tax, and the vendor has to report that as income.
@_date: 2016-05-05 18:40:09
Very few people have made a mistake this big. I don't look at George Bush and think, "boy he made a mistake invading Iraq, wait I make mistakes, so I guess it's ok." 
Ownership and accountability. You run a bitcoin group that controls bitcoin.
He should be fired. He should be ridiculed.
All assuming he is wrong.
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:17:34
I have some idea. Not a ton. 
Bitcoin (like Amazon in the beginning) doesn't have sales tax. And at no point do you declare your Bitcoin holdings as an asset with the local tax law.
All I am saying is the Bitcoin platform is not regulated, nor does it fall within the tax code. So every transaction is technically "illegal."
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:15:07
Not saying that. I am saying a person who invented Bitcoin would not surprise me to be in a tax "situation" with their gov't. What I am trying to say with my comment is debunking the correlation of CW is not trustworthy because he has tax issues. 
As for the reason of creation, I have no idea, but like you suspect the same.
