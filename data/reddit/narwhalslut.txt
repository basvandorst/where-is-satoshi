I don't even know what the fuck that means.
Everyone can read that thread. You still can't enunciate what your point is. You're a troll.
Coming at you like I had baby rabies? You made a jackass of yourself in that thread and I politely asked the first time*. Good god you're falling over yourself retreating and yet still making up a trail of diarrhea style bullshit as you do.
\* Oh. I'm sorry, I said, "I'm willing to bet you're clueless." Actually, no, I'm not sorry, you're pretty much confirming that to be true.
Ta ta.
(BTW, Following someone from thread to thread like you do is TROLL enough. The fact that you also tried to make some joke like I'm after cp on the hw is what makes me want to call you a 12 year old child.)

I'm sorry, can you back this shit up with some screenshots? This would demonstrate extrememly gross incompetence on gox's part.
Moving bitcoins... is an identical process regardless of what wallet it's being sent to, or which exchange's wallet you're sending to. 
randombtcer is right:  the blockchain is verifiable proof. if you got screwed somewhere... the information is there. It's literally impossible for bitcoins to disappear like cash.

tha_funkee_redditor is right. If I really *NEEDED* those coins, I could rebuy them on Gox and then move them to my BitStamp or Coinbase and sell. But yeah, that's:
- 118.5 on Gox (especially considering half of my money there is already in USD)
- 107.5 on Coinbase.
So I lose money to rebuy those coins and sell on Coinbase, and even if I sell what I HAVE on Coinbase, I'm taking a "psuedo-loss" then from not having sold on  Mt.Gox.
See, if it were easier to get USD out of Gox, I would buy 50BTC every day on Coinbase and sell them on Gox for a +$10-15 on each coin. That's $500/day, but there's no way to get the USD out of Gox back into Coinbase....

Man, I went out of my way to imply I was probably missing something since you clearly understood the tech behind it. Think you're being a bit defensive. I even intentionally used "personally" to underscore that.
Anyway! After getting some needed sleep myself and reading the rest of your post... I think I agree with you. I don't know what I was thinking last night. 
Hhm, I can think of a way to make OTP more secure for this scenario, but it destroys the ease of use of OTP and would pale in comparison that could be used anyway.

It's like someone locking and lock and then clipping the key onto the lock. (The following describes symmetric encryption, not asymm, obviously)
(key) + (plaintext) = (encrypted text)
and 
(encrypted text) + (key) = (plaintext)
Makes it pretty obvious, right? Ugh, maybe I'm expecting too much?

Although, his answer concerningly implies that a hacker can still gain a valid MtGox session id without my Yubikey -- that has to be a misspeak on his part, that should be technically impossible.
~~Fucking idiots. The core dev deserves to be mocked for not using two factor auth~~, especially since MtGox was sending the tokens for FREE for months and months and months.

There's no reason at all for the salt to need to be per-site. It could and often is per-user for additional security.
For example, if you were running a bitcoin exchange, you'd salt, you'd do it per-user and you'd use bcrypt/scrypt with a high high inter count

@_date: 2013-03-26 07:18:40
Not to be a jerk, but if you read more of the wiki and really understand BTC, you'll find that to be impossible. The ledger tells you the balance of every public address. Each public address has a private key t that allows spending out of that address. If those private keys ate lost, their values are forever locked in at those addresses. Never to be transferred ie spent ever again.
@_date: 2013-10-27 09:04:39
This would be... pretty elaborate to be honest. Like, this is a good (and so far the only I've seen) explanation that could actually work and break a TFA protected account.
But think about it. This is an interesting idea and i have very serious moral questions about the ideas I've been thinking about for the last few minutes. Hm. I'd say the extensions are worth checking. This would be something very dangerous if real.

These sites should be auto-deployed from a GitHub account and the commits to the GH account should only happen from public computers. Git lends itself to this nicely. Develop off line, push commits from a public place to a public repo.
Get your prod site to deploy from Git. This forces you to do everything through Git eliminating touch surface of your identity with the server being run.

Yep! Or use it as a simple second-factor auth for a phone-based wallet or something. Sure, there are valid uses for this, especially in cases of low risk data. But I wouldn't have my primary access to my wallet on it.

Wow, there are some fucking stupid people in the world. I don't get what it is about Bitcoin that makes some people so smug about trying to smear it.
I think they're envious that they don't understand how FX works and envious because they think they might be missing out on a chance to make a quick buck.

As someone who looked at embedding NFC in rings for a long time... there is almost no way this can be done in a truly, truly secure manner that properly leverages PKI to protect your secrets (aka, your wallet).
I wouldn't put anything Bitcoin related on an NFC tag to save my life.
edit: This uses the NTAG203. NFC Type 2. Meaning there's no encryption (and if there were, it would be symmetric, not asymmetric). Meaning the "auth" component of this will be the unique RFID ID.
And yes, all you need is access to an NFC chip manufacturering plant and ask the guy to reproduce some of the unique IDs... and now I've cloned your ring for all intents and purposes.
The way to prevent this is to use an NFC tag that does asymmetric encryption so that it can have a secret inside and can only respond to challenges and thus can't be cloned. Unfortunately, these effectively don't exist and/or wouldn't be readable with commodity readers and so wouldn't be practical.
Obviously this topic really interests me. If someone knows otherwise and can tell me, please let me know.

Oh god, "drama" already in this subreddit. Don't make me regret subing. Downvote and move on.
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:22:29
Right. But per wjbonner,


does not contain: MITM or [some other way of stealing session token]. (I agree. I discuss it with someone else in this thread).
I don't understand what wjbonner is saying. He clearly understands how TFA works, and OTP (and I agree with him completely about his statements regarding OTP).
But phishing and keylogging isn't enough, unless phishing means "steal session cookie". I personally don't think it does.
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:31:03
What does this mean? That's not the first/only...
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:40:42
Wat? I am my own CA in this case.
I mean, I'm agreeing with you for what it's worth. The important part is the "PKI" part. The specifics aren't important, but yeah, obviously I'm not going to have someone else untrusted as a root(er) CA for my cert.
@_date: 2013-09-13 23:06:33
Well, yes. That's how it works. That's why you can't review that shared secret once you've scanned it into your phone.
You could rip apart the phone rom and try to inspect the app data and maybe pull it out of there. Probably going to need root for that though. The GAuth data is blocked from backing up via USB to prevent that exploit.

Anyone have that turn around for US Banks? Got 10K I'd like to move.... :/
@_date: 2013-04-22 06:20:32
Wow, I had an ounce of respect for you before your edit. Can't resist the chance to make one last pathetic attempt at an insult even while running out of your last insult-started shitfest. Congrats bro, you're in a class of your own.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:36:49
Sounds like a great idea based on how well they work now. Not to mention the poet usage costs with the BFLs.
@_date: 2013-09-02 19:30:00
Dude, you're an idiot.
I'm on reddit for like 10 hours a day and I've never heard of this shit. You're very transparent, btw.
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:17:59
LMAO. I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make here. I'd really love to hear you try to explain it
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:46:54
I wonder what will happen when it finally falls apart. Will it crash upward or downward in price?
@_date: 2013-08-25 01:23:48


ding ding ding!
@_date: 2013-07-31 04:01:12
Man, overall, I'd characterize this thread as completely diskish and rude and shitty.
Good job guys.
@_date: 2013-08-24 07:43:54
I assumed as much. But that would be fine too... because then the fucked up part of my psychology would allow the practical side of me to actually... you know... get some fucking USD back.
@_date: 2013-09-27 19:24:52
;) I was going to give him a chance at least.
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:23:32


Man, if or when that shit happens, the value of your Bitcoin isn't going to be even on your radar of concerns.
@_date: 2013-08-29 00:17:56
Why? That's dumb as hell. A paperwallet doesn't force you to make raw manual transacts.
@_date: 2013-08-25 01:54:37
Mhm, that's indeed what I thought you'd meant.
All of the sudden, he decides to stop selling coins. He decides to retire to some random island.
6 weeks later..... he unlocks his vault where he's been keeping track of the private keys. He cashes out.
The best thing is, no one will notice immediately because it's not like people are tearing these things open every day. It could be days, weeks, months before any even knew what happened.
@_date: 2013-08-01 18:42:09
How about no? If you're stupid enough to fall for this, then go ahead and just send your coins to me, you're going to be parted with them soon enough anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-25 04:05:08
Can I run it in an emulator?
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:25:51
Only three days? I'm still getting nearly a week even on my third transfer, maybe because of the amount?
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:18:02
Can you explain what "routing trades to mtgox" means? Why would you want to? Why would we want you to?
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:40:20


Try again. It's ONLY allowed to be accepted if it's a form "OTHER THAN CASH" having a value less than $50.
Sorry, still illegal.
@_date: 2013-10-10 18:57:24
Too bad. Stop being idiot users and downloading EXEs and running them.
Or stop using Windows. Whichever is easier.
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:57:27
1. Stop fucking using Java.
2. Stop letting any plugin auto run.
3. Stop manually enabling malware access to your computer.
@_date: 2013-04-22 03:45:31
"Mostly useless"? really?
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:06:39
WAIT, WHAT'S BFL???????????????
edit: On a sidenote, no offense OP, but your friend sounds like a foolhardy idiot with too much money and not enough common sense.
@_date: 2013-08-26 21:58:51
* I suppose I don't know...
edit: Set up my merchant profile and generated a button. I'll have a friend buy a pair of socks from me for 40BTC and I'm set to pay out once a day in USD. We'll see if I get charged the 1% or not. This would be pretty nice to get money out of BTC w/o a fee.
@_date: 2013-09-14 00:56:58
Is this secretive for a reason?
@_date: 2013-07-10 04:29:11
Oh, so they can mail you a money pak faster than they would have done an ACH xfer? Makes sense, I guess I understand!
@_date: 2013-03-22 06:17:48
ddrescue or dd_rescue (the former is better, imo) if you can't read the disk well.
Also, you know, back up your private keys next time.
@_date: 2013-09-28 19:31:15
Uh, duh?
@_date: 2013-03-23 04:11:47




Man, which one of these is funnier.
@_date: 2013-10-01 00:14:30
So, using PKI for a second way of identifying yourself to a site?
Sure, but if you give them your public bitcoin address, you might as well give them the thumbprint to a Certificate you hold.
@_date: 2013-04-27 06:45:07
Who the fuck falls for this type of shit?
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:45:14
Holy shit. I don't know why everyone is congratulating. It seems like a very foolhardy time to jump in with that much money. But good luck, of course!
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:46:34
lol. Have fun with all of those values being floating point.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:17:31
Can we also get people to shut the help up about "Oh my god, I day traded and failed, no one else should try even though they've heard the same warnings I had heard!!"
aka, "I'm a unique flower!!!"
@_date: 2013-03-26 05:39:25
If there were no risk, everyone would be putting every USD they have into BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-26 13:49:14
Yeah, you can't do that... for a number of reasons
@_date: 2013-11-20 05:13:23
Haha, that's awesome. Hadn't considered that. I quite enjoy this.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:56:30
hahaha, sure, I'm laughing because it's too little! yes! muahaha, more like $50,000! 
@_date: 2013-09-13 06:41:33
What Tor Links page? Oh god, that's a good reason to triple check things.
@_date: 2013-08-29 00:16:47
And computers should be magically easy to use. Git should be as easy as SVN and I should be able to tell the computer "Make the heap not get corrupted on this one user's machine for this shipping blocking bug".
But then again, things don't work the way we wish for.
@_date: 2013-08-24 07:46:09
aren't these the ones that were cracked not that long ago?
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:02:31
Unless you're being sarcastic, go fuck yourself.
