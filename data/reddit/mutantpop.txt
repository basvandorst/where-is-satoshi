not a smart move. taking a 4k$ bank loan is the far, far cheaper option in the long run. hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:53:09
check back in a few years bro. obviously this is just starting to happen, that's why this is such a great investment opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:33:11
as can be witnessed in many tanking economies around the world - argentina, venezuela, zimbabwe...wait.
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:11:35
love it!
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:43:12
beautifully argued. thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:44:21
so you think the likelihood for making more gains is small and bitcoin is pretty much maxed out and about to crash, with bleak longterm prospects? if so, i am interested to hear why.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:02:01
maddening but maybe the life lesson he needs.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:20:42
government bonds as safe haven? damn bro, i just had a flashback to the 90's. danger of government default due to insane debt levels are substantial. this is an end game situation.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:12:37
This is starting to look more like a stampede than a normal rally. It would amaze me if we will ever see bitcoin go below 4K again.
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:05:04
and lambos
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:30:13
not so long ago goldman sachs called 4k by the end of the year. their guess is as good as yours.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:23:56
at the least, a cryptocurrency is replacing today's money. money is all about trust. more and more people are trusting bitcoin. happy days.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:21:04
not true. check the bilderberg attendance lists. royals are still deep in it.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:30:00
or you could just hold some bitcoin and make way more with next to no effort. the long term trend is obvious.
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:21:19
correlation &lt;&gt; causation.
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:28:39
wait, don't exit.
@_date: 2017-08-13 09:17:39
this. in the long run, these reward purchases will prove to be extremely costly. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:16:50
how do you short bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:33:35
he's perfect for the counter-movement. no show, just content. like crypto.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:09:00
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:10:16
you will very likely regret this in hindsight. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:26:04
we gotta move past the gloating and hostility. as correctly stated elsewhere, it's like obsessing over an ex-girlfriend. i know where i put my money but i respect others for choosing a different path. the real opponent is fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:06:41
but it raises the floor.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:32:05
i hope you are right but it sounds like wishful thinking rather than a real life scenario. to me this looks more like the broader public is starting to wake up, creating a momentum shift. the bitcoin brand is powerful.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:09:33
times are changing my friend. would you loan out money to an already highly indebted friend just so he can service other outstanding debt?
the fact that we are moving into negative interest rates should tell you that this isn't business as usual anymore.  default risk is real. but go ahead and keep lending money to broke governments at miniscule returns while the rest of us enjoys the ample bounty of the crypto 'bubble'.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:12:11
welcome to the club.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:40:58
this never gets old haha ��
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:08:21
just look at the long term fundamentals. a scarce, finite, trusted resource in rapidly increasing demand and amazing real world applications. crypto is going to change the world and bitcoin is by far the strongest brand in this business. i don't think it's a bubble at all.
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:10:44
how's that working out for you?
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:05:08
love it!
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:45:39
correlation might not be reproduceable. big difference.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:44:03
this. not over. we're continuously pushing 3800 resistance. that barrier will fall soon and we're at 3700. rinse. repeat.
everybody, this is good news. the market is getting rid of some dead weight before the next big rally. buy now and you'll score some cheap btc. wait a little and you'll score even cheaper. after that it's upwards and onwards for everybody. 10k is waiting.
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:39:48
look at the fundamentals: 
- limited supply
- a global monetary system on the verge of collapse
- total lack of lucrative investment alternatives
- a wealth of exciting new functionality of cryptocurrency
10k is nothing. stop thinking that small and hodl your seat at the table once we blast past this mark in a few months. avoid cashing out early as it destroys exciting future earning potential.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:39:48
obviously. on that note, can we expect more or less linear growth or exponential growth?
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:16:33
if we're lucky it will hit support at 3000$, the previous cycle's line of resistance. have your fiat ready boys!
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:21:12
let's agree to disagree on that.
@_date: 2017-09-10 08:23:24
this move would make sense for so many third world countries on the planet. when that happens btc will go through the fucking roof.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:44:15
your math proves nothing bro. if bitcoin replaces the dollar as world currency then 100b $ will look like childs play. which it will.
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:44:32
Degenerate gamblers buy at 19K. Smart dip buyers know that there is a ton of easy money to be made if they catch the bottom of the dip. So I don't really understand your title.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:26:01
wait! this is hundreds away from the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:01:07
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:25:55
he knows that squandering money on useless nicknacs right now will cost him a lambo's worth of coin down the road. i applaud him.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:06:28
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:01:16
maybe bitcoin is part of their plan. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:26:52
coinbase has no functioning customer support, a buggy verification process and very high fees. 
on the plus side, the interface is simple. their credit card option provides a fast way of buying coin. good entry level platform that you'll outgrow as soon as you want to get serious about altcoin trading.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:50:19
so is ark. quite massively so.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:03:38
good man, representing the community in style.
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:07:49
for some people it's simply unimaginable that there are people out there who don't like to become debt slaves for 30 years. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:44:57
below 2.8k is a dream scenario but unlikely. i just want for you all to get the most bitcoin for your fiat, so please stay put a little longer.
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:40:46
you took my comment way too seriously
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:27:54
will be lower probably.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:16:40
no, about those strong support levels. they got crushed today. we went from the 38th floor to the 34th floor.
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:03:45
With their current level of nonexistent customer service they will have no chance to compete in this market place in the long term.
My buy/sell option suddenly got disabled for no apparent reason. Contacted them yesterday. Have not heard back from them since. With the kind of money that is at stake this is simply unacceptable. A phone hotline is a must, an automated chatbot simply doesn't cut it. I pulled all my funds out. Plenty of competitors to chose from.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:35:59
i'll take that over 5000$ but really am more interested in quality altcoins that took a harder hit.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:27:16
this correction is triggered by china, not caused by it.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:46:05
wait a little longer. 3k is the magic number. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:42:04
Don't you just love the ambition?
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:05:45
@_date: 2017-09-25 15:00:09
since when does the ecb care what's within their power? didn't stop them from illegally buying up a ton of euro bonds. which makes this statement all the more remarkable.
@_date: 2017-09-14 11:33:44
about that...
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:13:35
Terms like "I went all-in on [insert coin name]" make me shiver. Gambling is going to get you broke in the long term.
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:07:31
gals, gender fluids...everybody is welcome on this ride.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:58:49
it would be like taking candy from a baby. even from an interface point of view you could easily improve upon the coinbase user experience. the whole validation process is flawed. transaction fees are opaque - you keep ending up with annoying small change after almost every transaction. decentralized exchanges are going to rape and pillage the current market.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:38:57
btw, all my favourite youtube crypto experts predict this to go down to around 3k. for what it's worth. just don't blow your load prematurely.
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:01:01
at the current growth rate of 100 bucks a day we will crush 10k inside 4 months.
