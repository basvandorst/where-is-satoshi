What if the channel gets destroyed or lost before it settles / updates to blockchain? What happens to the transactions on that channel (and therefore the bitcoin moved into that channel)?

Yes I know that, but the transaction itself isn't made on the blockchain initially.
Just like gold-backed currencies, you still "transact in gold", but not the physical gold, just the little notes that say "this piece of paper is worth X gold". Eventually when someone has enough paper they'll go back to the gold store and redeem their gold, or have their gold moved to their own gold storage (wallet).

What would the size of this be? if it's an Android wallet, and I have multiple channels that might be open (think Starbucks channel, walmart channel, amazon channel) with potentially millions of transactions, does my wallet hold all those transactions as well? Or only the channel creator?
Also, updating the channel to the blockchain, does the channel remain functional and can continue to be transacted with, or once it's closed it's closed (sorry, I'm sure this has already been answered somewhere). E.g. Starbucks has their own LN channel. If I go in and buy one cup of coffee, and decide to close the channel, what happens to the channel?
(if it's easy to point me to an explanation than to respond here, please do so!)

So basically bitcoin is gold, and the LN nodes are like currency backed by bitcoin.
Same thing happened with gold back in the day, which lead to gold-backed currencies being used, because directly transacting in gold was impractical. Guess we're seeing the same thing now for Bitcoin and LN.

Theft is theft, fraud is fraud. Surely there is something that can legally be done.
Pretend for a moment that I have bags of sand, and sand is unregulated. I give my bags of sand to someone to hold for me, as they facilitate the lucrative "sand trade exchange", but I still own it. They take it and don't return it ("Oh shit, there was a hole in the bag and it all leaked out and the wind blew it away! Oh my, so sorry"). Is there no legal responsibility attached to this?
Just because crypto's are a new thing, doesn't mean that aren't a thing of value - and anything that has value can be stolen (or lost by a responsible third party).
Stealing something is a crime, and therefore illegal. We may be building a new financial system, but fraud, corruption and theft has been around for a little bit longer, all of which can be dealt with in law.
I don't know if MTGox had any disclaimers on their site covering their asses, which stated they are not liable for the loss of any funds or Bitcoins they hold on behalf of their clients, but if they didn't, they should be prosecuted. Just because "sand" isn't regulated, doesn't mean stealing it is not a crime.

Does state = government in this article? I don't understand how Bitcoin will co-ordinate the building of roads and infrastructure, handle social welfare etc etc. 
You'll always need a government. Bitcoin can help bring that government to be accountable I'd imagine, but please, enough of this "government be gone" stuff. How is a currency going to run a country?  
@_date: 2014-02-13 07:49:03
*EDIT: I think I have misunderstood your question, so here's another response - no big business will lobby for the end to exchange controls, as the Rand is a comparatively small currency and will likely end up hitting the floor if people were allowed to transfer all their wealth offshore into another currency. It's unfortunate, but a country like South Africa needs exchange controls to survive in the global economy.*
My guess is that local businesses do not yet fully appreciate the change cryptocurrencies can offer, and there's likely little incentive at this stage to deviate from the norm (read: big business is making enough money, why change a thing when it's working well?)
When it's clear how business can actually earn income from cryptos, that's when change on a large scale will happen. Although this development by Standard Bank is a good thing for cryptos, they are a bank, and therefore can freely hold foreign currencies - so they really don't care if the SARB declares cryptos to be foreign currencies. 
This then also puts them in good stead to make money from cryptos by offering South African bitcoin (or other crypto) denominated accounts, and earn their delicious bank charges like they've always done. 
I wouldn't be surprised if the large banks in RSA end up lobbying for cryptos to actually be recognised as foreign currency.

Your response is so wrong and assumptive on so many levels.

The problem with social welfare is a social issue. Tackling that issue is partly done using money. Bitcoin is a form of money. I don't follow how a change in the money we use will lead to a significant change in social cohesion and a sense of community. I mean, whether I'm spending bitcoin or dollars, it doesn't change my perception of society, nor how much (or little) I care about community. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 08:53:37
Now this is a fantastic response! Thank you so much for taking the time to offer an explanation without resorting to naming me pro-government.
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:52:21
SARB is still mum on how they'll treat Bitcoin.
My guess is that if enough lobbying happens, they'll take Singapore's approach and treat it as an asset of value (and not a currency).
We don't want SARB to consider any crypto as a "foreign currency" otherwise our draconian exchange controls kick in.

Bitcoin is a currency that facilitates the movement of value. It's not a store of wealth (yet). People will buy Bitcoin, transact, and then sell back to their home currency.
Think of Bitcoin as a train. Is is a mode of transport for value. In this analogy, buying Bitcoin is buying a seat on the train. When you get to your destination, nearly everyone will leave the train (sell their Bitcoin for local currency). Right now, there is absolutely no reason to stay on the train. People buy bitcoin, transact, then sell bitcoin for their local currency. The only people staying on the train are those who believe they could be mugged when they leave (or something like that). Bitcoin's value hasn't improved because there are so many seats available (i.e. their is supply to meet demand).
Until Bitcoin becomes seen as an actual store of wealth, it'll only ever succeed as a medium of transferring value between two parties.

What a douche. Asking to "ban bitcoin" is like asking to ban Coke - if you ban coke, people will just drink Pepsi. Or Fanta. Or Sparberry. Or Mountain Dew. Or any of the OTHER MILLIONS OF FIZZY DRINKS OUT THERE.
@_date: 2014-07-25 21:17:25
I'm not pretending anything.
But if you think a change in currency is going to create a utopian state where everyone loves everyone and helps out, then you need to get your head checked.

In South Africa's case, any currency that's not legal tender within South Africa defaults to being a foreign currency, ergo only the Rand is a local currency and everything else is foreign currency (regardless of whether it's the US Dollar, the Martian Mitvah or the internet's Bitcoin).
So you're right in that "it's not from around here" is exactly how the definition of a foreign currency is applied to all currencies in South Africa to determine their status as local vs foreign.

No one in Venezuela can afford the fees at the moment, unlikely they're using Bitcoin for small daily transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:07:10
Thanks, I'll start treating addresses as "transactions" instead of wallets in my head. Appreciate the response!
I also have one last question if you wouldn't mind - I think the old multibit has set the transaction fee too low (0.000001) for my latest transfer, and it's still sitting in unconfirmed after an hour. Should I wait longer? If it never confirms, how can I go about upping the fee or cancelling the unconfirmed transaction (not sure this is even possible?)
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:39:01
Thanks, I'll start the resetting option, but also wait a bit longer. I read about transactions that never confirm, and the process of RBF not being available in some wallets sounds very much like a problem with particular wallets.
This has not been a very easy exercise I must say. I can't imagine how annoyed a new user would be if they inadvertently set their tx fee too low and their transaction doesn't confirm (or only confirms days/weeks later). 
Can you recommend a wallet that allows for RBF? Perhaps one that might suggest a proper fee to ensure faster confirms?
@_date: 2017-01-05 16:40:29
Thank-you for all the links! I can see why using Bitcoin still requires a bit of sophistication ^^
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:51:13
Thanks! So every time I want someone to pay me, I'll need to give them the new address generated when I click "request"?
For recurring receipts, or something like a donation button on a website, it's okay to keep using the same bitcoin address? I know some clients will see a bitcoin address as a "bank account number" and keep paying into that, so I need to be certain that bitcoin addresses can keep being used for many transactions over a period of time.
Thanks again for your time!

The sooner LN becomes pervasive, the sooner Bitcoin can be used as a transacting currency.
@_date: 2019-10-15 09:25:31
We have a similar approach from our local tax agencies. 
Once bitcoin IS being used as a functional currency, they will have no choice but to treat it as a currency (in this country anyway).
For me the uptake in Bitcoin usage is limited by the complexity of use, and the fees for use. LN being pervasive should solve the fee problem, and complexity should reduce as wallets become more "safe" (like seeds instead the actual file from a few years ago). Once the "average" person can use Bitcoin to transact with little fear of "breaking" or "losing" something, the more people will use it. My hope, anyway.

Couldn't central exchanges like this simply blacklist a wallet address, and then blacklist all subsequent wallets any coins are sent to? Having access to the public ledger, the exchange would only need to blacklist the original wallet, and from there would be able to see all other wallets to which coins are sent that should be blacklisted.
The only problem with this would be where the coins go through a mixer I suppose.
Also, this is the Bitcoin community, I'm sure this has already be though of / done already.

The "exit bitcoin" value will always be tied to the ability to sell when desired.
This "value" that people are attributing to Bitcoin based on these exchanges (e.g. MTGoX)is flawed in that if all the exchanges were to crash tomorrow, so would the value of your Bitcoin.
What Bitcoin needs is not only holders who believe it's value is not in the option to exit for a government currency (e.g. dollars), but in what else it can allow you to convert it in to (goods, objects, things - end consumer type goods).
Until such time as Bitcoin's value is independent of the operation of exchanges, you will always be at the mercy of the exchanges when determining the value of Bitcoins as a store of wealth (given you'll exit Bitcoins through converting to a government currency). 
We need more exchanges. And then we need ONE website that will allow you to link to all your accounts at the various exchanges (someone do this, you'll make a pretty penny I'm sure).
Right now, the biggest profit to be made in Bitcoins is through  arbitrage between exchanges. The fact that you can buy a Bitcoin for $75 on one exchange and immediately sell it on another exchange for $85 is symptomatic of how Bitcoin's value is dependent on the operation of exchanges - because there are only a handful of them. 
EDIT: for clarity

I was considering what's happened in Cyprus and the discussions of many deposit holders contemplating Bitcoins as a valid asset storing vehicle, and now all of these business dealings being exposed by the ICIJ, Bitcoin would be a perfect new vehicle to anonymously stash wealth.
