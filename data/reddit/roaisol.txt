Transactions that are larger in terms of bytes per btc are not prohibitively expensive there.  People with a use case for complex transactions that use a lot of block space will perform them there where block space is cheap. Its that simple.

The more sensitive people at the other subreddit will crucify anyone there for calling it bcash rather than bitcoin cash and just about everyone there calls that name an attack.  The name triggering on both sides is hilarious and I poke fun at it and really don't care, just pointing it out in relation to 'calling something other than what it calls itself..

BCH is right in that the BTC chain is pretty damn crippled and unusable as a payment network and most of the proposals do nothing.  They are wrong in that they think they have a solution that is anything but a (MUCH NEEDED) bandaid.

Because anyone who implies that the BTC currency should be made more functional is called a concern troll and a shill and BCH fan and shouted down and sometimes deleted by the local overzealous moderators.

@_date: 2017-12-18 18:17:29
You don't understand my point.  Comparing it to the other network is pointless.  For WHAT IT DOES, trying to be a global payment network, the BTC network is broken irredeemably, as is the BCH network, just with a 8x higher theoretical throughput.  The throughput is just too low and there are perverse incentives for various stakeholders and proposed second layer systems are all either something that you can do just as well with dollars or only have niche use cases.  
One can make an argument that a block as small as 1mb is MORE broken than a block as big as 8 mb, and one can come up with counterarguments (that I am by and large slightly less convinced by).  The concept is still broken.

@_date: 2017-08-27 02:13:55
I think the price increases are really an in spite of rather than due to thing.
A Segwit 2x fork, on the other hand, would have the best elements of both current chains.  I think it's a great idea that actually WOULD create value.

@_date: 2017-08-26 17:46:58
The much more interesting thing is it advances the halvenings by a factor of 10 and increases the rate of miner rewards by a factor of 10.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:58:01
That seems like an entirely valid and likely conclusion, not a conspiracy theory.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:11:33
I give it 8 hours before getting nuked for no good reason, followed by the other Reddit having a crowing thread about it with conspiracy theories that are far more convoluted than they have to be to explain it.

Well if that isn't a signal to sell I don't know what is.

Rule-enforcing nodes are nothing without miners.  The miners have all the power in this negotiation, unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:11:18
But hash power is what matters.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:38:22
My 48 hour wait has been a week.  Gonna contact support. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 13:13:55
It actually would work.  It would also represent a huge opportunity cost to the miner, who is already operating on very thin margins.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:13:53
It has happened to me on this sub.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:57:14
Quite possibly!  This being said the hash power oscillation makes the problem more intense for the BTC chain while making the BCH chain unusable for one day out of four in the short term and likely to lose much support in the long term due to the halvening schedule.  Nobody wins.
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:52:07
Felony tax evasion?

Dependent upon a new transaction format there is not much usable software for despite that long lead time.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:17:30
Near as I can tell there is nowhere on reddit to discuss bitcoin that doesn't have an agenda that favors a particular small subclass of stakeholders or another.
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:13:41
A user is not the same as a node operator.  The former vastly outnumbers the latter.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:08:18
Why would they be any different?
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:06:28
~0.075% more, according to _fork.lol_ .  It had 0.125% less five days ago, and has thus produced ~0.2% in five days.  This is approximately ten times the intended average block rate of both BTC and BCH, and something like seventeen times as many blocks as BTC, with a sixteen ish hour gap in the middle of it when almost nothing happened.  
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:14:22


I am told that frequently here, and sometimes that the block size should be reduced, to decrease centralization. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:54:16
Eh, I'm pretty sure both forks are irrevocably broken at this point.  Or at least stunted.  And captured by powerful constituencies.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:08:05


You can't use this to send a transaction
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:24:16
The inflation rate is not enough to mess with BCH, the total coins in circulation is very high compared to the block rewards even at the current large rate.  The interesting thing to watch for is what happens after its next halvening, which should come ~10x sooner than the next BTC halvening (~3-4 months from now).
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:35:04
The reason it is not profitable has very little to do with the price, it has to do with the fact that a minor interrupted the emergency difficulty adjustment oscillation by minding several blocks before it could go all the way down to being significantly easier to mine than the BTC chain.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:07:59
Every online community inevitably falls into a downward spiral this one and that one included.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:27:57
What is the slope of the relationship between network under-capacity and fee size?  Might they be making it back in other blocks with increased fees?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:07:27
Eh, still takes up 1000 of hard drive space.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:50:27
The system has been basically figured out for a long time...
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:04:20
Hence the word 'half'.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:05:11
And this one is rapidly approaching parity.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:02:15
Why do we have to care who is the 'true' bitcoin, its all just protocols and chains.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:07:02
If you speak out against the group think of the other sub you get downvoted into Oblivion speak out here you get deleted it's quite hilarious.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:54:22
Half the reason for the current high fees is the hash power oscillation induced by the difficulty change rules of BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-19 21:30:48
Yes but why all this yammering on all sides about 'what is bitcoin'.  It doesn't matter.  It's just chain 1, 2... n using protocols A, B... X.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:25:45
Why would it be a useless alt if 90% of the hashpower went to it and all the big companies used it?
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:06:28
That would probably be best for everyone involved.  Won't work, since miners would never knowingly kill this oscillation.
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:48:51
I'll edit an address in if need be.
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:04:03
You aren't alone.  The groupthink here is astounding.  Different from the groupthink at the other reddit, still hilarious.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:18:35
That they've noticed there's nowhere on Reddit to discuss Bitcoin without some form of bullshit or other happening.   Severity and exact form it takes varies but there's bizarro policing just about everywhere. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:02:43
They are possibly using the asicboost exploit to get more blocks than their share of hash power would suggest, which has side effects including not having segregated witness transactions and empty blocks.
I predict that if this is true, this behavior will be seen when the BCH profitability is only slightly higher than BTC profitability and will vanish when the profitability difference is larger, and the rigs that were asicboosting get pointed at BCH.  There should be enough variance from cycle to cycle to test this.
@_date: 2017-08-27 00:42:15
Removing some money from where it accumulates also helps moderate some of the instabilities engendered by the concentration of too large a fraction of money in few hands.
@_date: 2017-08-30 14:33:49
That's not the causal reason.
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:08:43
Yes and yes.  During the gold standard era after the Industrial Revolution when economic growth became normal there was a major financial crisis every 10 years or so due to the mismatch between the slowly expanding money supply and the rapidly growing supply of goods and services.  An inflationary currency has its own issues but normal financial crises is a unique issue for deflationary currencies.  There is not and never can be such a thing as apolitical money.
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:26:02
Profit taking and normal irrational human herd behavior. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:13:12
That really only works for platinum. Gold and silver and copper on Earth are concentrated by hydrothermal processes to very high levels in ores. In the asteroids, you are seeing raw asteroidal iron with impurities mixed in that, yes, do have higher levels of gold and other such things than random Rock on the surface of Earth does, but orders of magnitude lower concentration than on ores you find all over Earth. There is a small subset of iron meteorites that land on Earth that have higher platinum levels than platinum ores, although no one is really sure which parent bodies they come from or why they are different.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:02:19
Alternately, symmetrical upwards and downwards adjustments could work.  But the shared hash algorithm is just asking for interesting dynamics.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:05:23
You won't find any place on reddit for civil bitcoin discussion, sorry.
@_date: 2017-08-19 18:42:57
I am referring to a prospective 2x fork, not something that already exists, and the notion that if it happened it would be 'useless'.  Practically, no matter who was maintaining it or how carefully it was coded, if it took 90% of the hash power and all the big companies were using it the other chain would be the useless one. I am not talking about what should happen, just if the current signaling is to be trusted then that chain would go on and the current chain would not, practically speaking.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:29:01
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:09:45
Honestly I wish the brackets went that high over here for very high incomes, and that there was no distinction between income source for personal taxes.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:01:26
But the segregated witness transactions are entirely voluntary.  Without any such transactions the limit is still 1000 kb.

Deflation due to economic growth was the rule during the late 19th century. This causes the rate of growth to become wildly unstable and encourages spectacular booms and busts. A stable or mildly inflationary currency causes the growth rate to be more stable on average, there are still busts but they are not as catastrophic.

Beneficial and desirable is the easy part.
As a real economy of goods and services expands, the monetary economy must expand at roughly the same rate.  You get pathologies when the growth rates are too out of sync, although the pathologies of deflation are on the whole worse than the pathologies associated with the same amount of inflation.  The supply of total dollars must also expand when the savings rate increases.  Another way to think about it is that if the private sector runs a surplus, the sum of the public and foreign sector must be running a deficit (and the foreign sector gets its dollars from the public and private sector in the first place).  
The money supply increases either when the government spends more than it takes in, or when the banking sector lends more than it gets in repayments.  The latter is destructive because private debt always comes with interest and if private debt gets too high repayment sucks all the oxygen out of aggregate demand.  The former not nearly as much, because a government that controls its own currency need not default via small changes in the money supply, and because government investment tends to create more economic expansion than bank debt in recent years (which largely goes towards asset speculation rather than investment or wages).
Governments spending more than they take in creates money in one of two ways.  Under normal conditions, it creates money because even as the government issues bonds it simultaneously spends exactly the same quantity of money the bonds represent, but usually in a part of the economy with a higher velocity of money than the bond market, effectively more than funding itself.  Under other circumstances, the central bank monetizes some of that debt by buying government bonds.  This is significantly less destructive than some people think but must be done intelligently to actually produce good macroeconomic outcomes - giving all that new money to banks does almost literally nothing to the money supply whereas putting it somewhere where it would be spent on goods and services would cause the quantity to multiply up and the velocity to increase.
One cannot think of money as a substance that is conserved in flow like water or air flowing through tubes.  It appears, disappears, and multiplies depending on where it is and how it moves.  It isn't something REAL, it's bookkeeping.  Even under a gold standard.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:41:54
In what universe would China institute monetary policy as disastrous for an industrial economy as a gold standard?
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:16:22
In a growing economy a government should run a deficit to allow the money supply to expand and the public to save.

To rephrase, the average state of the government should be running a deficit.  With changes in the size of the deficit with the deficit larger in a recession.  Arguments can be made about the size of the changes.  But on the net, there should be a deficit in order to create the money that the private sector saves and uses so they do not create the money via private debt.

Signing something with a bitcoin address can be made to work identically to burning coins from an address.  Sign from it, and at time X that person gets access to a quantity of the new coin proportional to the balance of the address accessible via that address's private key.
