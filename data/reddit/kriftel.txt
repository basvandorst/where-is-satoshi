Not if you have to use the window beside the door to get what you want. Giving permission to do something, does not include permission to use "faults" to get something you normally would not.

The fact that the law defines a door as the legal way to enter a house, does not allow you to enter an open door and steal what's in the house. 
Taking something from the owner of this something without the consent of the owner is theft, no matter what way you use to access this something. It's about ownership and not access.
The fact that miners are able to reject specific transactions is in their discretion by design. The only way to avoid that is to have a lot of miners ie. a higher entropy as base of consensus. Since most "miners" are mining for profit and not "for the consensus" thus are using pools to maximise profit, they accept that their "voice" is used by the owner of the pool. 
Having a decentralized system does not mean "no control", it does only mean "no central control". In case the consensus defines an operation as illegal, they have the power to undo this, and this too is by design. 
Blockchain is not about anarchy, it's about decentralisation. Nuance! 
Concluding: everything that happened in this affair shows how well Ethereum actually works! Whatever happens, it will not decrease confidence in the network, it will increase. It works perfectly a designed, in all aspects. 
When it comes to TheDao, this might be different. One thing is for sure, Smart Contract development has learned on the hardway what classic software development knows for years: never trust code that has not at least 10x the same amount of code lines written in (automatic) regression tests!

Please don't forget that the mining farms are mostly not subjected to the same constraints than we are, which is... they get their energy mostly for free.
