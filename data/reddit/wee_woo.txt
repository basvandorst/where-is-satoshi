It just dropped down to $229. LOL.
It's still in a downtrend, and we'll be seeing lower prices pretty soon.

If everybody sold their bitcoins to themselves it could work!

No, YOU NEED REMEMBER that Butterfly Labs caused the crash today, as they cashed out literally millions of USD worth of bitcions they mined with their ASICS
Reminder that I Fortold This Happening.
Literally tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars rests upon what Butterfly Labs does
They have a massive, MASSIVE amount of ASICs, and even MORE preorders. They have at least 20,000 pre-orders for 60 GHash/sec units. 
They have MORE then enough wafers to make that many asics
If BFL starts shipping, the BTC difficulty will increase by more than an order of magnitude
This will very likely crash the price as the market will be dominated by these miners, driven INSANE by their 10 month delayed greed that BFL has been holding out on them while prices go up up up
meanwhile, literally every single GPU (hundreds of thousands worth) will move from BTC to LTC overnight, causing LTC difficulty to go up by 50-100x more. This will also crash LTC.
Then GPU miners will have nothing left, and the video card market will be FLOODED in used AMD 5xxx - 7xxx cards. You'll be able to get a 7970 for 100$, maybe less. But you run the risk that it's a destroyed piece of junk.
IT is fucking ABSURD that hese chucklefucks who have NO idea what they're doing LITERALLY HAVE WORKING ASICS AT ~35 GHASH/SEC DRAWING ~150 WATT, AND ORDERS UP THE ASS TO BUY THEM.
GOD i wish BFL didn't actually have a working ASIC, but it's objectively confirmed - THEIR CHIPS WORK, AND THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF THEM.
A big part of me thinks that BFL has been mining with them, and will cash out literally close to 10 million dollars of Bitcoins right as SOON as they start shipppig fucking over EVERYONE in a magestic death blow to bitcoin as a speculation / &amp;quot;investment&amp;quot;
