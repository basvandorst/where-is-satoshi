100% agree. Another interesting development will be the ability to transact in ultra micro payments, enabling an economy that simply cannot function due to high transaction fees in existing currencies.

Oops! Thanks for catching that. Fixed [here](

Fair enough. Where specifically is it incorrect? Happy to improve the accuracy.

ok, I see how that could be misread. We've just launched and are looking for genuine employers that want to use the service to  hire freelancers and pay in bitcoin. The 0.001 BTC is a small encouragement to add new jobs.
and thanks for the laugh...

Excellent description! "Bitcoin is an outlet for consumers and small businesses to connect globally with zero friction. Trust is placed in an online network that is the result of a scientific breakthrough in mathematical security that cannot be interrupted by outside forces."

You and this group may know all this, but the majority of people I interact with have no idea where to start. It's up to us to us to communicate bitcoin in simple terms to generate interest and curiosity in language most people can understand. Happy to suggestions for improvements if you have any?

Agree. If 2014 is to be the 'year of the merchant', then it's up to us to buy from them. I don't think hoarding vs spending is the argument, or whether the fees are in line with or more expensive than credit cards. We need to spend, even if the fees are the same and we lose a fraction here and there. This will create more visibility, better software, even more merchants and competitiveness to drive fees down. Our goal is to drive adoption. Who cares if we lose a few dollars?

Hi, fair point. We do not display the email of the company so that we can help screen the applicants. The point of paying the 0.001BTC is confirm the the person applying has a wallet, which indicates that they are already in the bitcoin economy. It also serves as screening for serious candidates, as it's a trivial amount. It's an experiments and we'll evolve as we get feedback. Thanks for the feedback.
