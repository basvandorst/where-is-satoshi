That's not what reciprocity is. Reciprocity would be if I show you respect and you follow suit back to me.
If I want you to respect me you reciprocating would be you wanting me to respect you.
Government is expecting trust without extending it... Giving it trust without being extended any therefore is called obeying or submitting; not reciprocating.
Edit: misunderstanding; this chain is all in agreement.

Ohhh, gotcha. I took the "This" which you stated disagreement with as the previous guy's comment.
Don't know if interesting to others or not but taking Java programming classes so I've been primed lately to use certain logic. 
"This" must point at something. Since it's the first thing you said and you were replying to a comment, that comment would be the presumed "this" and 'lack of reciprocity' gets assigned as a descriptor of "this".
It can cause trouble many places; recently I've been trying to stop using 'he' for everyone when 3 different male names/figures have already been initialized.

Which is why you simply pick a random reason, regardless of its relevance, and say you choose not guilty because of it. 
If they accuse you of attempting nullification, just do as the Romans(politicians) do and lie/play dumb.

I agree entirely with the 2nd statement. As far as the first, you may very well be right. 
I'm just not ready to rule out one of the reporters who "interviewed bitcoin's CEO" seeing one of the exchange's postings, not bothering to absorb or understand what they're actually seeing, then scribbling out an article about how silly people were for ever believing in Bitcoin.

If you'd like to have a conversation on the subjectivity of value I'd be happy to oblige you. 
Otherwise, good luck with believing in permanence and universality.

How do we know he gave it back? He doesn't say it specifically in the post and didn't make any further comments in this thread.
Or am I just missing something?

I'm not of the viewpoint that anything anywhere has what you define as "intrinsic value" in the first place so....

Because at least in an anarchy the businesses can't pay the government to write corrupted morality into existence to be enforced against a complacent populace. Bankruptcy, corporations, and other legal fictions wouldn't exist to protect bad businessmen.

What's that? Since people use tools to do bad things so we should hand the keys over to special trustworthy people who are freed from such human nature through the magical powers of "Democracy?"
Great plan! It's brilliant! 
I especially loved the part where you presented absolutely no evidence or studies showing Bitcoins level of corruption to be anywhere near the corruption of the current, horribly mutated economic system.

That doesn't mean "issue with Internet protocol" and "Everyone panic, bitcoin exchanges admit to massive security breaches" can't be written as two separate articles.

It's sad that I honestly can't tell whether you're joking about that being the lettering of the charge or not.
Neil Degrasse Tyson has a [story]( about how he went out to be on a jury but got kicked out after asking why the judge decided to read the possession charge as 2000 milligrams instead of 2 grams.

While I'm sure risk is some part of it, the precious metals business is a very low margin game where CC fees are most certainly passed on to the consumer as well.

Buy price with precious metals is the price paid by the mints and whoever else getting it from the mining operations and is generally known as the 'melt' value. 
From there it must be transported, minted, distributed, and then shipped to a customer. 
20% does still sound like a pretty big markup but I don't know whether you were looking at buying a tiny gram bar or several ounces and whether you're looking at government issued or generic so it's hard to tell.

I never said or implied I demanded a gold standard, hard money standard, or even a Bitcoin standard. I don't want any standard foisted upon me. If you, I, or others want credit based currency or otherwise, we should be free to choose whichever we see as best fitting our needs. Why do you insist on arguing with phantoms? 
Regardless; if deflation is prevalent it's ridiculous to assume people won't fix debt to rates of deflation when taking out loans just as they do when fixing them to rates of inflation when inflation is prevalent.

I see you either didn't read or ignored most of my response in order to build a strawman so I'm not going to go through the trouble of responding to your points either.


I very clearly did not deny that more goods and services are available today than 60 years ago. If you don't want to respond to what I actually said initially then we're done here.
@_date: 2016-09-15 11:58:30


Printing dollars does not increase availability of a limited pool of goods and services; it just raises the prices of those goods. Sometimes across the board, sometimes in specific sectors of a market which the newly created dollars are funneled towards.
Supply increases and the resulting deflation (hidden by such money printing) comes from increases in population, advances in technology, and further specialization/division of labor.
How about **you** think about your statement for a bit because your insinuation is ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-09-15 15:49:36
I address the fact that products deflate in absolute cost over time in my response. 
I was simply arguing against his insinuation and now your assertion that the creation of more dollars leads to the total pool of dollars having a greater purchasing power due to the printing of more dollars. 
Bread costs less in absolute terms due to advances in technology such as grain mills, advances in farming techniques, a greater population and therefore pool of laborers, advancements in transportation, the capital accumulation that allows people to pursue such technologies and advancements, etc., etc. 
It has nothing to do with us having more tokens vying for the overall pool of supplies than we used to. 
@_date: 2016-09-15 17:06:44
OK, I give up on trying to figure out who the hell you're arguing with since it's clearly not me.

You haven't met a **L**ibertarian who doesn't want such things but a good portion of **l**ibertarians don't want any institutions based on initiating aggression.
Even those anarchistic libertarians though do want institution**s** of enforcement against those who do commit aggression. You can still call that governance but most definitions of government include a unilateral monopoly on initiating force in a given/claimed territory.

Ah okay, thanks. I work in 3rd party gift cards so I'm  not familiar at all with CC systems but do have to keep up with what devices are being/can be deployed. 
Didn't have to keep up with PCI at all before but all these new Gen terminals block 3rd parties by default to help consolidate everything down to the big players.
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:31:11
Recent PCI  compliance changes dictate that all merchants processing transactions must upgrade to chip-enabled EMV  terminals by October or they will not be insured against data breaches or malicious network actvity.
That being said, the new PCI compliance terminals are terrible and there is a ton of push-back against the changes.
Some are placing their bets on the October deadline being pushed back but there's definitely a ton of these terminals being deployed across the US over the past few months and will be many more in the near future regardless of the deadline.
Edit: Though I'm not sure EMV is the same as what you're needing. I've definitely heard them referred to as 'chip-enabled' though

1920, 2560, or 4K? One, two, or three monitors? 
60Hz or 144Hz w/ Gsync? 
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say 1920, 60Hz and one to two monitors. 
That's what I run but I don't go around trying to act superior to people who are looking at beefier setups while pretending my "max" settings are universal. 
Edit: plus he may need to buy monitors and peripherals and I doubt you were including prices of those for your $800 quote.

From what people are saying, it's not just speculation that China is feeding Bitcoin, it's adoption. People are making large purchases in Bitcoins. The more people who use Bitcoin for the purpose of circulation, the more value that is needed to exist in order to fulfill that usage.
Adoption of Bitcoin directly leads to the increase of value of Bitcoin. It's as simple as that.

Regulations mostly I imagine. Forget the website but saw someone mention a startup website whose goal is letting people buy/sell on multiple exchanges and cash in/out in multiple currencies.If they manage to pull it off equilibrium should be gained incredibly quickly. I'm not positive the exact factors preventing such a thing to exist already but people are definitely working on making it happen.
