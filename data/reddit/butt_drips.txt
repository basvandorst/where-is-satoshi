That's also false and not what we were talking about (how the world views presidents). Regardless, Trump is still the least popular president in decades (from a domestic standpoint). Clinton being the closest to his low approval, but he managed to bounce back before the end of his first year in office. Careful where you get your sources from. Trump is wildly unpopular, except for in parts of America.

There’s no one authority for bitcoin. It’s a network of users who keep it running on a voluntary basis. If one person drops out it doesn’t matter. A lot of other cryptos do similar things to bitcoin (like use Blockchain technology) but they have a central authority which could be tampered with, destroyed, blocked, etc. the one thing bitcoin has going for it aside from being the original crypto, is that no one person can fuck with it (unless they acquired 51% of the hashrate)

Move $11,500 from your bank account to somewhere else as fast as possible and report back the cost, and speed. 
$1 is cheap as hell to move a large amount of money safely. 
It's too much for buying coffee, but that's not something you should do with BTC anyhow, until LN comes out. 
$1 to move 1 BTC though, very nice.

I keep seeing this argument, and it doesn't correlate. Bitcoin shouldn't be compared to companies, it's not a company. 
How many bitcoin holders do you know? Not talking Brad who bought $50 worth in late November and still has it. Talking the first 5 years of bitcoin. They aren't worried. They don't care that some startup coin has solutions that have carried them through the first six months seamlessly. Not to mention the number of them that are or will be centralized (bcash). 
They are waiting, and will continue to wait. They are confident in bitcoins ability to upscale, to the tune of $13k per coin.

You know how bad it looks to have Assange linked to bitcoin ? He’s not a good dude. 
Assange has wasted his credibility throwing in with the Trumps. He’s no Snowden, an actual hero who gave up his life here in America so that we could know the truth.
Assange wants nothing more than to return to his old life and he’s seeking avenues that will lead to him getting out his f that embassy. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:54
Snowden yes, but Assange is a stooge, who meddled in our election. Read up on him and Don Jr. He lost all credibility. 
And I don’t know why I keep seeing his name in this subreddit. It’s not a good look for Bitcoin to be linked to him. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:42:10
For now. As a person with an online store I support their decision. When the options for using bitcoin are better, faster, cheaper, they will take it again, and I'll start using it as well. It's just not there yet, but I'm confident it will be. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:57:04
Don’t let your bias get the best of you. I once thought Assange to be a hero/vigilante, but I was so very wrong.

And to add to this and try and answer more specifically, news and developments change the price. If amazon announced they were accepting btc in 2018 the price would skyrocket, if they announced another coin would be accepted, it’ll go down. It’s supple demand but way more volatile

Good time to buy then. 
Edit:if a major correction is coming that is. I think we’ll hold 10k+ but If it drops below that I’m ready to buy. I’ll be buying all the way down to 10 and beyond.
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:11:04
Did you read any of what he said? L2 is required. He’s not talking about Bitcoin now. L2 is coming and when it does, Bitcoin will be many things beyond just a store of value. 
There’s no reason to assume what he’s referencing in these tweets is ETH.

It sounds to me like they don't understand. Lightning will turn thousands of transactions into just one transaction on the chain. A side chain that manages all the LN transactions, and updates the main chain.

Another bad comparison. Laser discs never took off, and like all physical media (aside from vinyl which is making a comeback) it was inevitably doomed. 
The only way to compare Bitcoin to laser discs is if you imagine a world where those laser discs can be converted to 4K movies, and then to whatever new resolution is being used down the road. 
Is there coins with better options currently? Sure. But they aren’t decentralized, they don’t have 10+ years of development and security and they don’t have anywhere near the base that Bitcoin does. 
Bitcoin could plunge tomorrow but that won’t stop the people who have been championing Bitcoin from the start. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:18:04
It costs more to do a wire transfer and takes many hours and sometimes longer (non business days). It’s not convenient to move small amounts but when talking about a full Bitcoin, it’s still cheaper and faster than moving from one bank account to another.

I keep hearing this comparison to AOL or MySpace.
Bitcoin is The Bible, and everything else is written by L Ron Hubbard. 
Not that I agree with the Bible but it’s got sustaining power and that’s due to a base that kept it alive, that believes in it. Scientology is a means of getting rich.

Literally any and all of it has been disputed. Hillary is your typical big business politician with no charisma. She’s not some NWO antichrist, and she lost, so why are people still talking about her?
The allegations against Trump are actually based in reality. He’s everything they said Hillary would be and so much worse.

There’s some good answers in this thread but browse this and other crypto subs with high skepticism. 
I like the idea behind btc. No one person has say or ownership. It’s a very methodical (albeit slow) democratic process. Aside from “Bitcoin” being synonymous with crypto, I think it’ll continue to be the money of the internet. There’s a million dudes trying to pump up the altcoins they own but it’s hard to know what their end goal is (getting rich). Bitcoin has been successful because of the millions of people who believe in it. For every dude cashing out to buy a Lamborghini there’s 10 hodlers shaking their head. 
I highly suggest reading up on btc and other cryptos. There are a lot that have features that btc doesn’t currently. 
End of the day, BTC and USD are essentially the same in the sense that there’s nothing but faith  to back up the price, but BTC is deflationary and usd is inflationary. If you had $100 of btc in 2010 you’d be rich (150-200 million) if you had $100 in 2010, it’d be worth $100 but its purchasing power is weakened. If you invested $100 a month ago you’d have $150ish. You might have $50 tomorrow but who knows what that’ll be in 2023. 
There’s also an obscenely low amount (16 million btc atm) and only 21 million total. If the whole world used btc, that’s less than one btc for every resident of New York State. How rich you think they’d be in a worldwide scale? 
I don’t think btc will replace all other currencies, but I think at worst it’ll worth along side them. 
This is just some random shit out of my head. Again I’d spend some real time researching it, with a heavy amount of skepticism. There are altcoin shills everywhere. There are also some decent altcoins out there, just make sure they are serving a purpose and have a business plan.
