Im a regular person that was trying to invest.
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:25:41

@_date: 2019-12-02 03:17:19
Is that supposed to be what happend to me?

I'm in the US though and the person stated she was in Philadelphia. She was having me use blockchain also
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:54:34
I lost nowhere near that much

Don't feel comfortable saying publicly... But not enough compared to how others get scammed

Thank you! It was my own ignorance that got me into it.. I wanted the profit to help my family out
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:36:00
Yeah i have screenshots and what not im just gonna block her and leave it alone.. She's just adding price after price it doesn't take much to realise. I'll just be more careful in the future.

You're absolutely right! I'll make better choices, stay out of crypto and focus on what im good at
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:54:28
I just want out of the situation. This person is asking for more and more money with promises of profit. Im very uncomfortable and STRESSED
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:10:58
So i can just go to the police station and talk to them about it??? I have screenshots the different wallet addresses and everything
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:39:54
Will do! Thank you. No one in my area knew what to do at all. Im just gonna move on with my life.

What about taxes? I have only 3 receipts from the bitcoin machine.. I don't want to be taxed when im not even in the market. Do I just file a police report ?
