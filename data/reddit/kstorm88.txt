A cheap way is to get hunk of steel, and a cheap engraver. I had a piece of aluminum handy, so after I did it I made a sort of sandwich out of drywall to protect it from heat in a hot fire if your house burned down. You could also buy a small cast iron pan even and engrave it on that. Discrete and fireproof. Just make sure nobody throws it out

I had a limit buy at 9650, feeling pretty okay with that now. If I dumps below 9k I will put in another order at 8750

Big oil is going to kill Bitcoin? How? And I don't know if you know, but electric cars are doing quite well now. And I did watch that movie when it first came out.

More like $1000

$9200 will be the low to match the other Bitcoin time traveler.

There's a lot of people who do. He does real journalism and isn't tied to a network pushing some agenda. He's a proclaimed libertarian, and does great investigations.

You are correct, I should have specified that

Buying $1000 worth of Bitcoin is the costs $1000 wether it's in 2016 or 2140. Bitcoin is never "expensive". You will always be able to buy even a dollars worth if you want.

Don't know why you're being downvoted, but yes if it has appreciated in value, since your purchased it, you are responsible for capital gains tax

Don't put it on paper, paper burns, ink can fade, water damage etc. Engrave or stamp into something metallic, something that will survive fire. One recommendation I gave before was a cheap engraver on the bottom of a cast iron pan. Totally inconspicuous

I guess you can look at it that way. But it's like if you bought a collector car 20 years ago and all of the sudden it rises in value by 200k, you need to pay taxes on those gains. Crypto in the eyes of the IRS is treated as an asset like gold and not currency.

Damn $100? No thanks. I'll stick with my $10 engraver and a chunk of steel

I would probably add Infiniti into that. You can't really go wrong with Japanese luxury. May not have the quality of materials as the Germans, but the reliability is far better.

When I was suggesting infinity I was thinking q50 or 60 if you want to go fast or qx80 if you want a big boy

I just dumped another grand in at 12500

I enjoy my 2000 Subaru life.

You don't get bitcoins though. It's on an exchange. Not your keys not your coins

Wow, I didn't think people traded Bitcoin with leverage. You are very bold, or stupid
