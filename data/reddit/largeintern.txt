Holy fucken lol, you are delusional. If a US bank fucked off with $4M you'd at least get 100k back from the FDIC.

How is this forum not just constantly inundated with ambulance-chasers? Bitcoin must suck from an evidentiary perspective, because it seems like this place is short a few dozen leeches. 
If I was a practicing attorney in Hong Kong, I'd set up shop on just the fraud that Bitfinex allegedly commits every week.

Bitcoin addresses don't have a name associated with them, and it's trivially easy to split your coins into multiple wallets and recombine them dozens of times, completely obfuscating your trail.
It's possible to be anonymous in a way that's not possible with international banking. 
And even if you're in front of a court willing to accept the blockchain as admissible evidence, there's absolutely no guarantee the court will decide that data is worth anything if you don't hire an expert witness to explain it clearly to some cranky old judge.
I understand that Bitcoin has prioritized anonymity, and that people are paying for it when the exchanges steal from them.
'You fool, cryptocurrency is completely transparent, that's why we named it crypto'

Especially for possession of an untraceable asset that you may or may not be able to prove you own under the evidentiary guidelines of an overseas court operating by case law you don't know speaking a language you don't understand.
Bitcoin is the money of the future, for sure.

Good call, it's absolutely 250k since Dodd-Frank in 2011.

I'd be way more pissed off that the exchanges are stealing millions in untraceable assets but whatever, blame the guy for taking their claims at face value and trusting an established business not to commit fraud and grand larceny.

You're fuckin crazy, then. Nobody is going to take that shit on contingency.  They're out of Hong Kong and you're trying to recover untraceable 'currency' with a wildly fluctuating value. 
What if it takes 5 years to get them into court and by the time they recover any assets they're worthless? What if the only way to recover is to hire a legal team out of Hong Kong (it is) and coordinate with them on filings and discovery? That's a mountain of work, and much of it will have to be done in a language you don't understand.
This is not a case that will be worked on contingency in a million years. This is a shitshow.
