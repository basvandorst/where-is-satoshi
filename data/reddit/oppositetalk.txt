I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:41:36
i have not yet been able to do so
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:38:56
this sounds like the way to go, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:17:27
the one i use still exists
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:17:52
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:47:39
tried this and nothing. guess it's gone. 
thank god i didn't purchase more. 
this is why i think bitcoin is fucked. so damn complicated to use/hold/get liquidity on. 
yes, i'm sure you'll all say i'm a fool for not being more responsible, but this is why i only spent 300 bucks on it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:22:52
i will pm you a question now
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:06:05
i would get occasionally emails from my bitcoin wallet provider that there were requests to gain access (likely phishing) , but that if i didn't 2FA, that it was likely ok.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:04:56
is the probability reasonably high that it could have been stolen? if so, glad i didn't buy more.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:20:54
i just have the wallet identifier number 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:51:57
yes i think you are right. now i just need to figure out the standard bitcoin address
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:16:37
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:20:08
i'm probably doing something wrong
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:54:49
i felt the same way a few years ago when it peaked at 1200. i only bought 1/3 bitcoin. kicking myself majorly for not buying more then. haven't bought any since, either.
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:06:19

I hope my wife and I die together in our 80s.
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:55:16
i've been waiting for 14 days now
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:59:55
Also very kind, thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:23:24
There is no mail service.  I could open a PO Box but I have no need to receive anything from anyone so I haven't bothered.
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:38:07
that's how a lot of the world lives my friend.
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:06:55
Agreed.  I just can't in good conscious buy right now.  Seems like a frenzy.  Could be a smart play even despite the frenzy but I just can't do it.  
I'm just now making plans to buy in when the time is right.  I guess best to go with MtGox?  I would hope that its possible to put money into an account where I can put in an order to be filled at say 300$, and another at $200.  If they fill, great.  If not, well, I guess I missed the boat.
Is it possible to do as I just described?
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:46:37
thanks but i'm afraid btc is a little too scary for me.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:17:32
thnk you E75, very kind!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:49:42
This will be my backup plan.  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:46:25
point well taken, but these exchanges could try a little harder to come up with ways to verify me and millions of others like me in this position.
edit: didn't fully read your comment. yes, you are right.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:59:51
That's a very good point.
Now, how would a local bitcoin in person transaction go down?  Would this person have some sort of physical item/wallet to give me in exchange for cash?  How would I know its legit?
Sorry, I am just unfamiliar with how that would work.
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:23:11
No joke, my way of knowing when to sell an asset is the first time it makes the cover of Time magazine.
However, with Bitcoin, I'm holding and will continue to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:46:53
I agree.  Verification is absurdly difficult.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:13:39
What would you recommend?
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:55:46
replying to your edit - same issues with btc-e.  Given my location, it requires proof of address which i cannot provide.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:55:30
Because not carrying stupid paper money is better than carrying stupid paper money.
@_date: 2013-12-01 11:52:59
I am in the same boat.  Just trying to get in now but having massive problems getting verified by both Mt. Gox and bitstamp.  I live in Laos and don't have an address.  Very problematic.  I wanted to buy in at 600 a few weeks back and in the time its taken to get verfied (and i'm still not) bitcoin has doubled in value.
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:31:48
Why would I lie about living in Laos?
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:14:47
I was interested in mining litecoin but I just dont have the means to do it.  I just have a laptop and to be honest its really all over my head.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:57:12
I will definitely look into this.  Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:06:58
why hath satoshi forsaken me?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:53:06
exchanges probably aren't happening anyway, but yes, you are probably right.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:58:24
I am the world's wimpiest investor. i just see the losses.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:11:23
I'd love to set something like that up here but I think its a bit early in the BTC game for that to take off.  So few people in the world have BTC, those that do want to hold them, and even if people visited where i live would they really think to try and exchange them for Lao Kip?
Sorry, just thinking out loud.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:06:15
It's one of the poorest countries in the world.  If you live in one of the cities (and i use that term very loosely) you can get a POBox.
Most people are subsistence farmers, they don't have much need for mail as everyone in their family lives with them and they are far more concerned about trying to survive another day.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:18:37
same here brotha.  i would love to buy more right now but virwox is at its limit with me for the next several days.
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:20:47
i love goooooolllldddd
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:55:12
I fully expect it to work.  I believe its an automatic 48 hour waiting period the first time one uses it.
I would never  use it again bc the commission is really high and you can only do 80 USD at a time.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:58:06
price is $250 less than it was 10 hours ago, so who knows...
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:04:02
How would an in person meeting go down?  Would the person I meet with have the bitcoins in  some sort of physical wallet?  How would I know its legit?
Just curious, as I'm not familiar with that sort of thing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:35:48
That might be worse!
I surely would have sold as well had I bought in.
I will keep an eye on things and if it dips down around 200 again I think i'll buy a few and just hold.
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:06:27
typical shitty mcfaggot move

Would help if I didn't ask a bot, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:11:00
much appreciated sirius!
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:56:13
how long do unfilled orders stay up? for example, could i put in order at $200 and hope that one day it will fill if the price somehow dies one day?
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:23:07
I cannot verify my address because I do not have an address.  I guess I am probably just screwed.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:08:39
i'll have to look that up...
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:22:45
thank you.  id tip you if i could!
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:21:26
There is no mail system
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:04:35
You must not live in the US.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:58:03
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:37:25
How did you wire transfer the money?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:45:30
Mail offices exists in a few of the 'cities' but good luck getting a letter sent to a specific person's house.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:24:13
I can understand that I would be considered a risk, certainly.  I will look into btc-e.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:08:53
I pay in person at their office.  if I'm late on payment, they send a person to my house.  when i signed up i drew them a map of how to get to my house.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:25:06
My internet gets about 2MB/s, or is supposed to anyway.  It's generally pretty reliable but has its moments.  It's also capped at 40MB month and drops to 256k once you surpass it.  This costs 100 USD a month.  I've heard there is a new service that gives you 10MB/s for 40 USD a month with no bandwith caps.  So, I'm going to try and get that.
The average income of my village is probably 1-2k USD per year.  
I dont particuarly want to post pictures of where I live because this is the internet.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:17:51
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:53:36
Thats very nice, thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:52:19
this is good advice.  thank you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:29:47
try living in laos.  i'm forced to buy terribly small amounts with very high exchange rates from virwox.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:44:39
the irony...
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:03:53
No, the bank I use here does not require an address.  I deal with them by going to the bank directly.  I cannot ask them for a bank statement with my address on it because I do not have an address to give them.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:40:00
THERE IS NO MAIL SYSTEM IN THIS COUNTRY.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:40:00
I have a passport yes, but I'm the problem I have is that of residency proof.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:50:43
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:05:06
Yeah, I dont think that sounds like a good idea.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:27:22
All of these options require residence verification that I cannot provide.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:48:09
Being in Laos, they are requiring Tier 3.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:59:38
i will maybe try and buy .1 bitcoins every so often.  as i mentioned in a previous post its really tough for me to get verified because i live in the middle of a 3rd world country with no scanners that are good enough for 300dpi.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:47:37
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:43:04
there is no tax authority for me as this is a communist country and foreigners are not allowed to own property.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:07:24
Olaf, metalface!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:48:33

@_date: 2013-12-02 04:54:01
That would be wonderful.  I just got word Mt. Gox will not accept my paid internet bill because they consider it an 'invoice' and not a bill.  Fucking idiots!  Please let me know your email address and I'd really love the help!

@_date: 2013-11-19 11:30:54
that's my plan.  just need the price to come down...alot...
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:53:11
I suppose it would depend where he lives in Thailand.  I've never traded over localbitcoins so I'd have to research how to do that.  Sounds like a possibility though!
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:50:48
will pay this forward, thank you!

When its on the cover of Time magazine, sell some.
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:10:20
I absolutely understand why this is the case.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:13:09
FYI, btc-e does for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:47:32
You are not alone in this cancer shit.  I live in Asia and am flying out tomorrow back to New Jersey to be with my dying father.  He can't eat, shits himself, and cries because he is so scared.  My poor mother is watching her partner of almost 50 years die very quickly.  It's just awful but I'm glad I can be there for both of them.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:01:24
Someone helped me get started on one but i don't have photoshop and i still need to make a few changes to it.  would you be able to lend a hand for a small btc tip?
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:53:33
i'm looking into btc-e but it has the same required residency proof that the others have, so I am not hopeful there.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:49:33
ha, sounds about right.
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:00:45
care to help me do t his?  someone was nice enough to help me get started but still need a few more fixes to it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:43:45
surely i would have sold before now but not at 20 bucks.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:49:44
I am so moved by your story.  I really wish you the best.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:43:32
i own some btc but desperately want to see the price plummet one more time so i can buy a few more and then call it a day.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:28:22
I am not comfortable with this.  Sorry.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:04:58
Same exact problem there.
Edit:  I'm trying bank verification.  That seems like it might work but may take a few days (which is fine).
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:42:01
there is no tax process as i dont own a house or business.  in fact, as a non-lao, i cannot.
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:15:10
why on earth did you do that?
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:47:23
Which exchanges/sites have you tried to buy them on?
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:12:20
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:32:25
I am not asian and this is not a cash dealing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:30:28
that sucks but hindsight is 20/20
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:38:17
I have but since I am in Laos they require tier 3, which is residency proof.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:02:40
Northern Thailand is almost viewable from my house.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:18:19
Nah, no worries there.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:28:09
I just bought some SLL and quickly got some BTC.  Looks like Ill have to wait a couple days for verification but looks successful.  thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:03:05
If I know Elizabeth well, and I do, I'd be surprised if you'll get much bitcoin action.  Anyway, I will visit your restaurant/shop.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:09:13
I am set up to recieve tips through the bitcointip function, but i don't want to post a wallet address until I know I can have it verified and actually use it (if that makes sense).
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:27:26
I don't think Schiff is 'wrong' for having a different opinion, even though it is wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:00:40
I have gone back and forth with the MtGox people probably 10 times already.  It's a real pain!!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:32:48
I am here helping to de-mine the country.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:36:33
Btc-e also requires the same type of residency verification, so i'm not sure the outcome there will be much different.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:05:37
You would think so, but no.  My driver's license and government ID here do not have my address on it, as I have no address.
It just says the name of the village I live in.  To get places here, you tell people the name of the closest temple and meet them there.  Crazy, right?
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:17:54
Long term, believe where bitcoin is going.  Short term hysteria due to being in the news...wait another week and we'll see some dips into the 2 and 300s.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:40:00
Thank you.  I have several documents written in ink (but also in Lao not English) with proper government stamps on them.  Perhaps that will work.  I will send some over and see what they think.
I have a vehicle registration with my name on it, but its written in Lao.  I'm going to show that as well of picture of me holding today's Lao newspaper in front of the bike with license plate.  
Desperate times call for desperate measures!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:23:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:55:09
Have you read anything I've written?  
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:20:52
I will be out of the country starting the 17th.  When will you be here?
Edit: If I'm here while you are here, I would be very happy to meet up with you.
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:54:48
Lots of things can happen and the vol is crazy so I am cautiously optimistic.  I just have a sense it will take a bit dip for a very short while before continuing its upward trajectory.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:26:28
I just did this.  Said it will take 2 days for verification since I'm a new account (and surely bc it saw my IP being from Laos).
It looks like it will work just fine but holy moly do they rape you on transaction costs.  
@_date: 2013-12-04 09:18:04
I would suspect that there are large portions of the world that do not have mail delivery.
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:12:14
Are you being sarcastic or is that how it works?  
I have never invested before, so I really don't know.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:41:27
totally agree.  but most people don't have access to a computer so that could be a problem.
but since about 2 stores in the whole country even take credit card, this would fill a big void.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:20:15
It's so volatile that I think I will have a chance to buy in again at 200-300 bucks.
I can't fathom anyone buying right now.  Hopefully the hype dies down again in the next week or two and we see a nice big selloff.
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:30:35
I dont know you either.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:06:58
Yeah, woops, sorry I messed up those figures.
It's 40GB a month.
@_date: 2013-11-20 08:09:35
I am the in the exact same boat as you, looking to get in at the same price you mentioned.  Let's friend up and keep in touch!
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:58:26
ha, well thanks for making me feel very slightly better.  and thank you for the tip. 
hope you have many bitcoins and are otherwise hoarding them!!!
@_date: 2013-12-24 12:20:48
i dont want nor need gold. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:54:56
What I wanted was an ability to purchase bitcoins electronically through one of the main exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:45:43
I doubt it but I'm at the point of begging them to come up with an idea where I can prove I live where I say I live.  
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:57:00
Happy and ready to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:40:30
yeah, sorry man.  they realized right away it was no good.  thank you for trying though!
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:29:27
awesome - keep me updated!
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:20:14
THANK YOU!
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:57:36
i would like to but i am having a lot of issues getting verified by both mtgox and bitstamp.  i live in a 3rd world country with no scanners capable of 300dpi.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:45:16
same.  these same people, many of them, bought in within the last 2-3 weeks.  inevitably there will be some big and temporarily bad news that will cause a big drop.  those people that bought in will  freak and sell out and i will gladly step in to buy at a discount.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:00:46
this is why i'm holding off until it gets back into the $100-200 range.  I think a lot of people are doing this. 
No offense, OP.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:12:42
FAQ ---------------------&gt;
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:20:30
this is why i can't get into bitcoins.  wtf are you people talking about?

Whaddya a black guy named phillip or thumpthin?  tssssskkkk....
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:50:28
I agree.  That book has really help me as well.

this is interesting but probably out of my comfort zone.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:14:15
I have been watching/reading about bitcoin since its worth was about 10 dollars. Never bought, assumed it would flop.
I am jack's soul crushing regret.

@_date: 2013-12-01 14:25:49
For many reasons, that is unfortunately not an option.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:11:07
and because fuck the international banking cartel and the whores it rode in on.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:07:55
1000-1500 USD worth
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:10:53
They require that I have tier 3, which includes residency proof.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:52:27
that is a bizarre graph
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:33:15
that's very kind, thank you.
i am very excited about the future of bitcoin and will pay it forward.

I feel the same way but have only $23 USD in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:12:56
Is there a website where a person can 'earn' bit coins? Surely, there are people who would pay me in bitcoins to do things.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:01:14
Are you being sarcastic? Am I completely off base thinking that?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:27:35
You pose some interesting questions.  Looking forward to answers from people much smarter than myself.
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:06:46
i'll take a look.  thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:35:59
I agree.  I'm just not rich so I'm hoping to buy at a more reasonable price (for me).  
I fully believe in the long term gains bitcoin is sure to see, but I do believe we are seeing a short term mania and as such thing the price will dip and dive wildly, particularly this week.  I realize its not a stock, but the levels of excitement and publicity are pushing this up to overinflated short term heights in my opinion.

I'm sure that localbitcoin works, but I'm just personally not comfortable with it.  I would only do it through what I view as a very reliable exchange.
The bank account process has also proven very difficult for a variety of reasons relating to my current location.  Not impossible to get it sorted out but would take more work than is really feasible.

Can I get in on the bitcoin tip action.  I am killing myself for not buying in at 10 bucks when I had the chance.  And I hold zero bitcoins right now :(
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:59:42
Also, don't i have to register for an account, get checked out (id check, utilities statement) which takes a few days, and then getting orders placed takes a few days.  Isn't like a week from now if I decided this minute I want to buy?  Also, do I get the price I put in for through that exchange or does the delay in placing the order affect the price i get it for?
sorry for all the questions!
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:40:56
thanks i am going to look more into this should the exchanges not approve me in the next few days.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:43:41
I think you will be able to.  Given the volatility, its not at all unreasonable to expect severe price gyrations.  Once this is out of the news again, I'm hoping to buy in at around $200-300.  I'm going to buy 4-5 of them hoping that in 30 years I can retire on what those 4-5 are worth.
@_date: 2013-12-03 17:15:40
I'm not quite sure I understand enough about this to do such a thing, but it is intriguing.  Maybe I can talk to you more about this somehow?
Edit: And truthfully, I only have about $1000 at most that I'm able to put towards bitcoins.  And, I'd probably only buy small bits at a time unless the price went down to about $500 (which personally I still think may happen given a big scare hits the market and shakes the noobs off the tree)

people here barely have running water, let alone phones and computers.

@_date: 2013-11-19 06:25:24
Is that for sure what is going to happen in the future?
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:44:22
also every document is just written in pen and will not be taken as clearly they think i could have just written them myself.
most airports in this country don't even have computers for check in.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:12:27
There is no mail system.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:38:23
I will look into bitstamp.  Tough to figure out which exchange is best to use.
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:07:37
I had a paid bill (ie. paid invoice) from the internet provider I have, which had the name of my village on it, but neither exchange would accept it.
This is really frustrating!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:07:49
if i had photoshop i would!
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:11:54
Almost every bill I pay, either the company sends someone to the house or I have to drive to the companies office to pay in person.
Also, there are virtually no stores/companies/services that accept credit card.  So, if you need money you have to go to the bank or ATMs.  Half the time the ATM's are out of money or not working. 
It's a real hassle.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:51:23
I think what I'm describing is a serious drawback to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:48:38
we shall see.
