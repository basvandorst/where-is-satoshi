Yeah... never gonna agree on this. Your "free society" would fall apart in a matter of hours. I wouldn't give it a week.

It's the ideal. It's what we should strive for. It's why we let people vote, so that they can theoretically vote for the common good.
Real life is *never* perfect. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be striving for it and trying to move towards it.
And in reality, there is no way to replace the state. It is necessary. Private interests *cannot* represent the common good.

Come on, I can do the same. So f*ck you people with romantic views on capitalism.
The real answer is that neither system alone is sustainable. A healthy balance must be achieved, with one becoming a constant check on the other.
In Poland, you were too far one way, and in moving towards capitalism, you're moving back to where the ideal point is. You'll probably swing the opposite way eventually, and have to deal with that. That's where the US is. It's swung too far to capitalism and away from socialism. It needs a check back to the middle.

But... that's not the definition of capitalism. And even if it was, that's an ideal that can *never* be achieved in the real world, at least not without *incredible* government intervention to maintain it.

Nah, they could just hire roving bands of mercenaries to take things from you.

I read through what's posted there, and honestly, my opinion has only fallen (if that's possible). I'm sorry, but it reads like something a college sophomore (I use that term on purpose) would come up with after partial exposure to ideas, without thinking things through.

How do you ensure the perpetuation of a free market without a strong outside influence (the state)?
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:12:04
Do you honestly believe that people who attain wealth will somehow just sit back and compete fairly? That they won't form monopolies, fight to keep competition from occurring, and even go so far as to actively harm their competition? Government, in it's ideal role, prevents these things from occurring and enforces a fair playing field.
I really don't understand how you can be so naive as to think that everything would remain fair without a government in place to ensure it. The world just doesn't work that way. If it did, we never would have had governments form to begin with.

Because there will always be people who abuse whatever power they have. Without a check on that power, it will cease to be a free market.
A perfectly free market relies on people being just as uniformly good as a perfectly communistic society does, and is thus just as unrealistic.

And this attitude sickens *me*. Food stamps are the *best* thing the US has ever done. They've ensured that their population never needs to go hungry. That's the most noble goal possible.
So I get that you're burned out on anything socialist. I get that capitalism has helped, and brought you a better quality of life. But don't think that a perfectly capitalistic society is some dream. It's not. It has problems, too. Let's all be rational and pick and choose the best parts of each so that we can get the best outcome possible, with all people taken care of, but strong rewards and incentives for people who work hard and rise above their peers.
@_date: 2014-12-15 14:16:07
Exactly. How can you ever have a perfectly free market in the real world? It's impossible. A pipe dream.

Just the right amount of bullshit mixed with false sincerity and even a "mea culpa", all with no actual concrete response or solution.
Someone's spent too long in the startup community pitching to investors and not nearly enough time actually making a working business.

He's been living in the world of talking to investors and pitching an idea. Now he has to deliver, and he has no experience at all in that area.
His investors need to seriously reevaluate their choices. Even if his business plan was solid, they should have put someone else in charge with a track record of building up difficult supply chains.
