Learn your lesson and keep playing the game.  If the opposing team scores a goal against you, do you give up?  Keep playing and never give up.

What we need is a wallet where you can temporarily lock up funds, just in a very short term way perhaps by putting them in a smart contract.  Say you lock up some of your coins in a 24 hour smart contract and others in a week long smart contract that only releases them when that time has passed.  Then you have what you want for spending available now and if someone did this to you they still wouldn't get them unless they actually kidnapped you for that long.

I have had moderate ME/CFS for almost 7 years now at age 28.  It started after a lyme infection.  Had to drop out of University and have suffered greatly since.  There are around 6 million bed ridden ME/CFS suffered worldwide.  If you put them all together that would be an entire city of bed ridden people.  You would think that would warrant a huge amount of funding.  Guess how much we get in research funding?  Approximately $3 per patient per year.  That is the WORLDWIDE funding budget.
This is an unfolding humanitarian crisis that has slipped through the net.  We are too ill to even protest properly for our cause.

Where are you getting this $15k a coin from lol?  BTC can easily go to $150k a coin in 3 years or maybe less than that.

What does this mean in terms of the lightning network?  I thought we were getting that in Q4 2018.  Is that still happening?

Source that 93 hedge funds bought BTC?

Exactly, $50k is more like 2019 prices.

Is this an ETF?  I thought there weren't any Bitcoin ETFs yet.

Interesting.  What effect do you think that will have on Bitcoin price?  Sounds like extremely bullish news long term to me if the Chinese government are going to end up with with a fuckton of BTC they are going to want the price to be sky high, and are perfectly capable of making it so.

Nothing is bad about it.  ETH had one it skyrocketed afterwards (probably not because of the split, but the point it is the split didn't make it go down, at least not for long).
