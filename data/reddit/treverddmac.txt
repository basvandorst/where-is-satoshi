Some simplistic additions to your analogy;
Compare a gold miner selling gold to buy more mining equipment to a bitcoin miner selling bitcoins.
Gold mining has a geographical location attached. You can stake a claim on an area and take your time mining it, confident that your investment in mining equipment will be put to good use.  Bitcoins seem more like a free for all. *
If a lot of people invest in gold mining, production increases, more supply for the same demand. The price of gold may go down but you end up with more gold in the end than you started with, and the price will recover. 
If a lot of people invest in bitcoin mining, the supply of bitcoins doesn't really change that much (50 in 10 minutes is extreme, and it also means you get to next adjustment twice as fast). But the price of bitcoins would probably go up, because everyone wants to get the USD value out of their hardware. They end up with more in terms of USD but less in terms of bitcoins. 
This says nothing for or against cointerra or bitcoin mining, just wanted to think out loud. 
*reminds me of a story from an old prospector who told me that back in the day staking claims meant nothing. If your neighbours heard you smashing rocks one day, the next day they would all be there with you, smashing rocks. 
Free from government intervention.

At first I was like "what's the point?"
Then I tried it and I was all like "wow that was awesome"
So hard to get people to signup with cavirtex to do the bank thing...
Quickbt was Instant, easy...  If you can pay a bill online, you can buy from quickbt. I was really impressed, and it is how i am going to introduce everyone to bitcoins from now on.

I think rather than bother with a 51% attack, it would be way cheaper to slowly buy a few hundred million dollars worth of bitcoins over the next year or two, and then totally destroy the price with massive sells. Rinse, repeat.

The other day I was in a building supply store, Interac went down, place cleared out so I went to the grocery store, which had a sign on the door "debit/credit down". The whole town was shut down. 
It's just so common. That is what happens when the government enforces banking monopolies, I guess. No need to provide competitive service.

It's a pretty small amount.
