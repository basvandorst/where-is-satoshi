If he's giving out pizzas and your backhandedly accusing him of fraud based out of total ignorance, then guess what?
He's better than you. As a person. Its not even close. So again, he's right. Assholes don't like being called assholes, but they are, and the guy who calls them one is not also an asshole for pointing it out. 
You asshole.

Guy donates to charity, organizes charity and accepts donations to further said charity. People show up calling him all kinds of hyperbolic evil stuff because *they* don't understand how bitcoin works, so they take actual data they know nothing about, interpret it wrong, and proceed to hunt witches and pass out pitch forks. Your hiding behind the "I was just asking" defense is flimsy. I'm just asking, is Obama secretly a jihadist Muslim socialist? Oh I'm not saying he is, I'm just asking. Please.
I can see how he was defensive. I don't know if "overly" really applies, and you're clearly the cunt. Read through this thread with the hindsight that all of the mouthy iToughguys are wrong and this guy legitimately gives free pizzas to people. He donates time and money to make the world a better place, then let's you get involved and handles all the paperwork and hassle. Maybe that's grandiose. I dunno. Seems like a generally altruistic gesture to me. And if that 1,000 number is accurate, that's legit. 
If you're shitty to someone, and they're shitty back because you were shitty in the first place, that's on you. You come at people like that you get that response. Actions and reactions tend to be equal and opposite.
