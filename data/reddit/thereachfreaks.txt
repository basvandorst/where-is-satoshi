Not only the transaction fee...
Think about the transaction post\-time. How far does that money move? Lol

Congrats, you've done your part to ensure adoption. Now, if only everyone else on this subreddit did the same thing... BTC would be worth 50k right now.

Also, many people thought the block was a genesis block... Just because of the zeros.
This is an eye opener. A lot of people really don't understand how blockchain works, yet "support" it.

If that's the case, why do people up vote it in subs like this?
