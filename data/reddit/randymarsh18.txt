Just don't let the HODL blind you. Take out profits and be happy with your gains.

I don't think there's anyway you can explain result-oriented thinking to him for him to agree with you. you clearly explained it, if he doesn't get it now he won't get it anytime soon.

i agree with your point, but i think the point these people are trying to make, is you will get more of the alt currency per $ you put in, so  20 eth gets you 20 etc for the same price as 1 btc getting you 1 bcc.

2500 to 2000 is a 20% loss and 200 to 150 is a 25 % loss...
