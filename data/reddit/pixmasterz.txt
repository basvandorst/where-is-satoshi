I'm talking about someone targeting bitcoin generally, not just 1 person's address. It creates one giant incentive to crack bitcoin's cryptography.
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:53:48
Doesn't bitcoin then make all the cryptography it uses less secure by creating an incentive to crack it ?
@_date: 2015-06-06 18:54:06
No warranty or official support for the software that holds my money? Gee, where do I sign up!?!
@_date: 2015-06-13 16:29:20
By the same line of thought that reusing addresses makes the network less secure, bitcoin having value makes anything else that uses its cryptography less secure.

What happens to the blockchain is irrelevant to buyers and merchants, they only care that it works. If bitcoin cannot handle a certain number of users, then it's adoption will be limited by that number.
Off chain transactions? You mean like PayPal? We already have that, so why re-invent the wheel for bitcoin? They are hardly an "innovation". And side-chains? You can't call something that is non-existent an innovation. I'm calling vaporware until proven otherwise. Also, side-chains are just alt-coins designed to not reduce bitcoin's market cap. How convenient.
Increasing the block size is necessary for any wide-scale use of bitcoin. Just because it also requires a method for compressing the blockchain doesn't mean the problem should be ignored. You can't fix everything just by building more stuff on top of the problem, sometimes you have to actually fix it.

So your solution is to have 1000 mini PayPals? That is the dumbest idea I have heard in a while. So will they all compete with eachother, yet operate for free somehow magically, or will they charge a fee based on data like bitcoin? If they charge based on data, how will making 1,000 separate transactions decrease the amount of data sent or lead to lower fees? Have you thought this through even a little?
@_date: 2014-11-17 17:31:04


But it's also bitcoin's loss. So why should I and &gt;6 billion other people just adopt a system where the coins were effectively premined when the bitcoin protocol is infinitely reproducible? Every new generation of adopter will just make and mine their own coin and oops, that explains the 100+ alt coins!
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:16:55
What actual features have been added to bitcoin core?  And I don't mean in the last year, I mean, like ever. I always hear about these great new features coming to bitcoin(true anonymity, floating fees, multi-Sig escrow, sidechains, colored coins, merkle root hash), but they are always just talk, and never materialize (or are never part of bitcoin core). I've never even seen any update in basic performance to bitcoin. No block time reduction, no block size increase, no faster difficulty retargeting. Those are just basic things that every random alt coin has managed to improve. Bitcoin has shown it cannot solve even its most basic problems, and has become a bloated, slow moving bureaucracy, not unlike the banking system the community derides so very often. The fact that the community is dead-set on not changing anything ensures bitcoin's future as a technology that will never be able to adapt to anything or ever gain mainstream adoption.
**Getting back on track**: except for dark wallets, what do these 3rd party services do that you couldn't do with money? And if these services are centralized and 3rd party, how are they better than using regular money with banks/PayPal?
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:19:22
How can you not see a problem with bitcoin being unable to handle 1/500 of the world's transactions if it's supposed to be a global currency?
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:53:09
In a world where government tries to shut down cryptocurrency at every turn... They called him the creator of Bitcoin, because they can't prove he's not. Now, he must find the REAL Satoshi Nakamoto, in order to clear his name!
@_date: 2014-10-10 01:22:49


So, they will be trading litecoin and dogecoin? :p
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:53:49


"Reversible transactions will grow bitcoin's user base!" Ironic.
@_date: 2014-12-27 20:43:08
According to 


It's a cypto signature dance that's pain in the ass to do.


It's totally not trustless, and requires manual verification


Those micro payments aren't even "real" payments; Alice can't use them until the end of the day anyway, where she gets her total payment in full, so the whole thing is a waste of time.


So basically, in the end, it doesn't even really work. This is an even worse idea that 1000 mini PayPals. Not to mention this doesn't even solve the problem we are talking about, which is not micro payments, but a high number of transactions. You definitely can't reduce the number of transactions by splitting them up into 100 more transactions, so I don't even know why you brought this up. We're not talking about Bob needing to pay Alice 100 times a day, we're talking about Bob needing to pay Alice and 99 other people, and those are completely separate transactions. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 20:54:48
Read the comment below, even 500x isn't enough to compete with Visa alone, and yet you're gonna fight a measly 10x increase? This is precisely why bitcoin is going nowhere fast.
@_date: 2014-12-27 18:20:33
You don't have to tell *me* that, you're preaching to the coir here.
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:50:06
Bitcoin is a human right? I'd love to know your opinion on water.
@_date: 2014-12-28 01:48:51
Did you miss the part where I said micro payment channels doesn't even solve the problem we're talking about? Wanting to keep the block size low just so your pet project gets implemented is incredibly shortsighted when it's only helpful in certain use cases.
@_date: 2014-12-27 19:38:30


Yes, and they all involve not using bitcoin.


If you want to use a third party service, we already have PayPal and other payment processors.
@_date: 2015-05-22 04:36:00
Withdrawing from my savings account costs me a grand total of $0.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:47:59
17 dollars? Now that's gangsta!
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:58:27
I'm certainly not willing to pay extra because of an arbitrary cap. That's even if I did believe bitcoin would lead to a better world, which I don't.
This is incredibly ironic considering the number of times people around here criticize banks for "charging people to access their own money!" Bitcoin does exactly that.
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:05:28
I'm not invested in bitcoin in any way whatsoever. I just find it, and its trials and tribulations interesting. The max block size is an arbitrary cap *because* it increases fees and increasing it 10x would not require anywhere near an unreasonable amount of bandwidth.
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:44:36
So then in this scenario, what does bitcoin do?
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:25:15
So basically Paypal, but for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:40:58
TL;DR Don't fork bitcoin. Buy litecoin!
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:32:21
No, I was pointing out that while your funds can't be frozen with bitcoin like they can with Paypal, bitcoin can be stolen without recourse unlike with Paypal. Bitcoin has advantages, but its disadvantages are much worse.
@_date: 2015-08-10 04:29:46
I have no idea what that is supposed to illustrate. Hard forks are bad because they are bad?
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:20:10
Cards? Yes, and the same would be true for PayPal, which is what bitcoin was being compared to, not physical cash. My point was PayPal might have its inconveniences, but bitcoin has its own issues which are far worse.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:07:06
So in the end the customer has a choice between something that has the same benefits and drawbacks as Paypal, and bitcoin which has worse drawbacks. There is no case where bitcoin is the superior option because it can't blend its advantages with other services. Bitcoin can't depend on a 3rd party service to make up for its faults because not needing 3rd parties is the point of bitcoin. The fact of the matter is at some point bitcoin is going to have to be redesigned if its community actually cares about it being feasible.
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:45:07
No, you were moving the goalposts/changing the subject. I was continuing an ongoing comparison, so you can't blame me if you don't think Paypal and bitcoin are comparable.
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:11:17
So any update that requires a consensus fork is an altcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:14:53


Well, you sure convinced *me* with that excellent sales pitch. Where do I sign up?
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:58:32
Yes, it's a good thing the decentralized bitcoin has a small number of big, known mining pools that can be held accountable (because in a world with a large number of tiny pools, a small pool wouldn't care about its reputation since individually they are all unknown anyway).
@_date: 2015-08-14 23:16:35
Money sent to the brainwallet "greg" was stolen within 1 second as well, but the transaction took over 10 hours to confirm.
@_date: 2015-08-06 06:58:08
The issue is that bitcoins can be stolen over the internet without recourse, and it happens [more often than you think](
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:59:08
You still haven't answered the question of "why would a customer choose to use bitcoin in the first place?"


I've already explained this before, features can't be layered on top of bitcoin. Using something like Coinbase just recreates the experience of Paypal without the benefits of bitcoin, so it's completely pointless.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:14:36
Remember that time this guy's Bitcoin wallet was emptied so he called Bitcoin customer support, and they said "sorry it was our mistake" and the coins were released back to his wallet? Oh wait, that shit never happened.
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:24:03
Why would customers want to get rid of their consumer protections?


So what is encouraging the use of bitcoin here? This can be done with literally any cryptocurrency. I'm sure you wouldn't mind though.
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:43:17


Those are not an issue for customers. The thing you are missing here is that you are going to have to convince consumers first.


Bitcoin theft.


Apparently you didn't read or understand what I wrote about people not having a reason to do either of those. People who want "PayPal-like consumer protection" (which is most people, so it's hardly pointless) have no reason to use bitcoin and will use Paypal. They will not use Paypal but with bitcoin, because it has no benefit over regular Paypal, so it's a waste of effort. Most people are not going to put up with the risks of coins being lost without recourse or the hassle of cold storage. The end result is there being no major use case for bitcoin.


It's not my responsibility to make you understand. I am not here to evangelize. If you refuse to see things for how they truly are, there is nothing I can do.
@_date: 2015-08-10 02:26:41
Not to read too much into your metaphor, but on an actual tree, which branch is the "trunk branch"?
@_date: 2015-08-01 03:55:16
Good thing it's all about the technology so it matters not which token they settle on...
@_date: 2015-08-10 02:52:28
So then if bitcoin forks, both core and XT will be altcoins, because branches aren't trunks.
@_date: 2015-07-29 21:10:00
That's what Square Cash does, it instantly transfers money using the debit card networks.
@_date: 2015-08-06 02:38:12
Storing money in a form that allows it to be stolen over the internet without recourse sounds pretty irresponsible to me, personally.
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:10:18


Fair enough, but that is a far cry from the "i cannot wait for that fucking day when btc takes over" line of thinking because:


Most people are not going to put up with that.
@_date: 2015-08-07 02:45:52


Merchants already have multiple payment processors to choose from that will let them process credit cards.


But they can already switch and still accept credit cards, which is how everyone funds their Paypal purchases anyway.


You can accept credit cards without using Paypal.


Yes, one that doesn't involve bitcoin, because why would they? They have nothing to gain by using "Paypal but with bitcoin" because such services already exist with regular money.


No, the point is such a security solution doesn't exist, and nobody is going to use bitcoin when their coins can be irreversibly stolen over the internet, and using a 3rd party with bitcoin discards its main value proposition. There is no use case for bitcoin other than people who dislike 3rd parties **and** don't mind their money being easily stolen without recourse, and that is a limited target demographic.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:32:43
So you're saying his problem could've been solved by not being robbed in the first place? Genius solution.
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:20:58
Remember back in the day when if all else failed you could always just mine your own transaction? When will you people finally admit bitcoin has failed at being a decentralized platform?
@_date: 2015-07-29 00:40:09


Or you know, they just hide their hash rate. Also, there will always be *someone* who centralizes before everyone else, and they will *always* benefit before the fork kicks in. Also you say it like forking again and again is easy, but history has shown that politically it is not. **You even express this later on in the comment!**


I would love to see this proven.
@_date: 2015-08-05 23:49:08
That sounds like an interesting service, but if your coins get stolen from such a vault, does Coinbase reimburse you?
@_date: 2015-07-29 01:49:43


First, I assume you are talking about the 2010 incident. Weren't there like 100 people running the software then? There will always be someone who benefits from the delay between recognizing malicious centralization (which is impossible anyway) and the fork. You would have to fork within 1 block to stop anyone from taking advantage.
This is all beside the point, I put a PoW algorithm that solves centralization once and for all in my hypothetical scenario to make a point: the bitcoin community cannot generate the political will to fork to a new PoW even once.


I really didn't want to get into this because this is something I already know we disagree on, but whether it's harmful is irrelevant. That's not how democracy works, a powerful few can't just override the people and decide a certain idea is dangerous. If you want freedom, you have to take the bad with the good.
After your first comment, I realized something, my idea of a decentralized system requires that everyone on Earth be able to mine their own transaction once per day. [According to WolframAlpha]( that would require a block every 12.34 microseconds. Bitcoin would need a revolutionary change in design to make this possible. It's just not going to work as a decentralized system anywhere close to the way it is now.
@_date: 2015-07-29 03:32:55
Why is that unreasonable? Just because bitcoin can't do it? That sounds like sour grapes to me. I don't see how bitcoin can be considered an open protocol when a person can't even mine their own transactions. Otherwise, it's just an oligarchy of miners that get to decide what transactions are allowed rather than the protocol, making the whole system pointless. What if someone wants to send a transaction that is valid, but has an effectively zero chance of being mined?
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:45:23
Let's pretend that such a centralization-proof PoW algorithm existed right now. Would the developers even try to implement it, or would they bow to the power of the miners?
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:53:23
Sorry for your loss but it has nothing to do with Bitcoin, so it shouldn't be a cause for you to lose faith. I understand you're venting but you gave your money to a stranger. Accept that you share 50% of the blame for not being cautious enough, with other 50% on the fellow who took your dough. That leaves no blame for Bitcoin, by the way.
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:19:51
Now now, there's no need to be reasonable here.
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:04:53
The rest of the world might be able to "use" bitcoin, but they aren't getting any money out without an exchange. It's not like there's a trustworthy exchange in every country around the world. Bitcoin is even worse for international money transfers.
@_date: 2015-02-10 17:50:03


So then basically, PayPal?
@_date: 2015-02-07 02:00:47
How do you aquire bitcoins without a trusted 3rd party?
