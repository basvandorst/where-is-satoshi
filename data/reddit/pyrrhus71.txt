I’ve been doing this a while. You’ll get there.
@_date: 2019-07-02 05:00:43
Feeling better now. Almost like I’m not stoopid.

No! 8550!

Coinbase always deposits my fiat within 2-3 days (excepting weekends).
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:29:13
Deposits into my bank account when I withdraw from Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:56:53
Either up, down, or level.
@_date: 2019-07-17 21:50:01
Heh, heh, heh...

Bid/ask spread

Think solar flares of the strength that can wipe out all electronics. Reference the Carrington Event in 1859. Read about it, and then think about how that would effect us today. Still, buy BTC, but only what you can afford to lose.

That’s the most stupid comeback ever. There’s also about a .01% chance that you’re talking to a Baby Boomer, but you’re too stupid to even understand the reference, and thus use it incorrectly.

I agree, I was merely trying to clarify what the other poster might have meant by “phenomena from space”.

Tell him you’ll do it, but that there will be a hold put on his check until it clears, plus ten days. He’ll go away.

Coinbase is an exchange rather than a wallet. The safest wallet would be one stored offline.

It seems likely that the path upward, if it exists, will be full of peaks and valleys rather than a geometric increase. Nobody can tell with certainty when the next dip may be—they’re all guessing.

You’d prefer disorganized religion?

Jack Dorsey can eat a bowl of unwashed dicks.

Looks like I really nailed the call to sell at $10.6k. Maybe I should start a crypto consultancy. /s
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:07:44
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:47:37
Probably. If you did it, it’s done, so there’s no use questioning it. I suspect you’ll be happy you bought at $11k when it hits $20k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:47:37
Then just say that.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:46:21
And the other thing.
@_date: 2019-06-13 12:04:23
This guy probably drinks heavily.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:31:14
Probably about .001%
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:43:43
I did sell some at ~$10.6k with the expectation that I’ll be able to buy it back at a lower price. I’ve been right every time I’ve done that, but at some point I’m sure I’ll be wrong.
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:11:01
I’m going to guess that a recession will inflate, not deflate, the USD price of BTC. So in that case, you wouldn’t want to get out of it.
@_date: 2019-04-10 04:38:05
A real bitcoin would “feel” like electrons, not a token.
@_date: 2019-04-11 11:40:31
I don’t know. I only dabble—I’m no bitcoin billionaire, but I’ve paid for Christmas a time or two for my large family and bought some fairly expensive stuff with gains, but I’ve been happy with them. 
Like I say, it might be that new users are having to deal all at once with verifications and holds that I dealt with piecemeal over 2 years. You’re not going to be able to take advantage of a run on BTC if you don’t already have an account set up, so that might also be why people are mad. Who knows.
@_date: 2019-04-11 02:00:44
I’ve seen some of the complaints about holds on Coinbase. I don’t know if that is for new users, but I never have holds like that on there. There is a 6-day period before I can withdraw crypto’s, but I can sell them and receive the funds very quickly for anything past that time.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:56:45
Still a good call.

I know 90% of this sub will revile me for this, but just try to dollar cost average your investments. Investments should be diversified. I’m into crypto, gold, stocks, and bonds. I had a pretty good arbitrage deal going with gold and btc for a while. When btc was low, I’d buy. When it went up, gold would inevitably be down, and I’d buy gold with my overvalued btc. Rinse, repeat. While I’ll concede that those who bought a bunch of btc at $.03 are better off than I am, I’m not mad. I didn’t have that opportunity because I didn’t know about it then. I have to work with what I know. 
These days, I’m sort of convinced that btc is here to stay, so I won’t go below the .25 btc threshold, regardless of arbitrage opportunities. The one caveat is that if btc got high enough to pay off all debt, I’d sell every satoshi in a heartbeat. 
So good job. Don’t get into debt again and count yourself a wise man.
