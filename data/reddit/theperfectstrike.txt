Saying, "You're just a dumb Indian" is racist. Saying rural Indian villagers living without smartphones are uneducated and not likely to use e-money isn't.

What about all the people who aren't connected? The people who live on around $5/day? The vast majority of the world lives in poverty still and we're over here talking about e-money....what a shame.

For some reason I can't imagine people in rural India exchanging bitcoins for rice...or educating them about it for that matter when most educated American's need someone to sit down with them and explain what it is. Try that with someone who never went to school.

Bitcoin replaces fiat currency. Everyone tries to buy bitcoin to make more fiat currency? Same with gold. People buy gold thinking it's going to be worth more down the road? When fiat currency is replaced by e-money, what will a bitcoin/gold oz be worth then?
1 oz gold = 1 bitcoin?
1 bitcoin = an airplane ticket? 
Also, people realize the bubble in 08 was simply inflated again right? Everyone knows there is a greater recession on the way because of the bailouts? It's amazing to me that people go around acting like it's all sunshine and rainbows and will always be. 
The financial advisor to trump is ex-CEO of goldman sachs? How can anyone have confidence in wall st. these days seeing that their seeing more deregulation than ever?
