Paxful is good service, but there are a lot of scammers and coinlockers.

My english isn't very good vut I will try ;-)  
So, basically "coinlocker" is a scammer. He's trying in every possible way to force you release BTC first.
Example. You're selling BTC. Scammer open a trade and force you to release BTC first. If not -- you must wait few hours for the end of a trade.  
NEVER! NEVER release first BTC until you receive a complete payment!  
Few months ago I tried Paxful, here is my account -- [  
But I have only ONE real trade, other several dozen was from scammer that want to scam me.   
I hate goddammit scammers, so all these accounts was locked by support. I had all proofs and screenshots to prove that these few dozens wanna to scam me.  
Mostly they have a very bad English and they have the SAME TEMPLATES.  
Also, never look at "reputation", many scammers have many accounts, and they are making "a trades" with the sames accounts and leaving positive feedbacks.  
One thing you should know about Paxful -- it's a good service, but there are many scammers.  
You should never release your BTC first!  
Cheers!

You cant use some little exchangers. There are two good monitors for those:
BestChange.ru  and  Kurs.expert, then you need to choose the direction (you'll see feedbacks about every exchanger) and that's it.
About LBC, many people use it in Ukraine.
