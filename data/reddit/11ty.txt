Who knows, I had 8.51BTC on there that were lent on margin, so technically I didn't have coins but USD or an alt with my name on it.  Total coin toss as to whether that means I'm safe or not. FWIW I only had a margin lending account.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:12:27
I'd be really cautious about buying right now.  I've been through this sort of thing with BTC way too many times to have not learned the following lesson:
We are in the center of the communications channel.  When news breaks you have approximately 45 minutes to react to best protect yourself.  In the few hours following the news the rest of the people in the center of the comms channel will react.  It will then stall or recover while those in the center find their footing.  Anywhere from 12-48 hours after news release there will be a "round 2" where those not continually checking BTC related news feeds get wind of the situation and react.
Now, I don't know if it will play out *this way this time*, but from my experience that's how it has played out almost every other time.

And yet, SW only has 10% adoption.  Had abysmal miner adoption, and was touted as having OVERWHELMING CONSENSUS.  The only reason it was ever activated is because of SW2X, which actually had overwhelming consensus in the only non-gameable metric - hashpower.  The small vocal majority then scared market participants to start reneging on commitments to larger blocksize.
It would be really nice if you guys started being honest about the history here.  SW is OPT-IN.  These companies are OPTING-OUT.  That is their choice.  You have yours.

I'd only say you think it's the 'best way' because it aggravates them.  Perhaps the better move is to not try and start a naming war.  If we all just accepted that they want their project called Bitcoin Cash, instead of BCash, maybe things would be clearer.  Now we have Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash (which claims its the real bitcoin), and BCash (which Bitcoin people claim isn't the real Bitcoin.)
You've now turned two into three.  But it's only really two, because some people don't like what other people called it, and then there were all these political games amongst exchanges.  So I'm a new guy and don't understand which is which and what is what and what the fuck is going on.

It is and it isn't.  Core chose not to be a part of SW2X, but they were are part of the NYA which is what preceeded SW2X.  Here some members agreed to code a 2mb hardfork patch and then miners would run that and SW and everyone would be happy.  Those members at NYA failed to write the patch and/or get it merged.  Then miners said fine, fuck SW.  Then some dumbfuck vigilantes made some hats and tried to force miners to activate SW, at the same.time they told ~~small~~ big blockers to fork off.  They did and now Core crew whines about scams and all sorts of bullshit because people finally did what they asked and it all blew up in their faces because none of them have any fucking clue how to manage this thing properly.

The people who are responsible for what we have today left Bitcoin in 2011 and 2014-2015 with the exception of Peter Wuille, who is probably the last Core dev that has my respect.


Core could have disbanded three years ago and Bitcoin would still be here, and the idea that the price growth is because of the Core Devs is completely laughable. I would argue they have done mostly fuck all for value in 2 years.

Well considering block size increase talk has been going on since 2011 then maybe Core should have, at some point, started working down that path, no?

It follows until the ATH, at which point the price drops for near two years and the hashrate continues to climb.  If the parent statement is true we should see a lagging decrease in difficulty for the entire time period that the price was dropping.   
I'll concede the hashrate is dependent on price to some effect, but IMO it's not true to state that hashrate follows price because we have the empirical evidence that suggests it is untrue.

IMO breaking it into those two arguments is short-sighted.  Further, I don't agree with this BS concept of "more stress tests", especially not in the capacity of forcing one's hand.
The block size does need to be increased, a floating cap should have been implemented a long time ago, long before the average ding dong of heard about Bitcoin.

Again, it doesn't need to outcompete every user, just the attacker.  
If your argument is that you need to outcompete everyone (which isn't the point I was addressing) then you need a public fee market, or your wallet needs to let you know what a competitive fee is.

No, we got some bullshit that only works for specific types of transactions.  These specific types of transactions that people can't even use because everyone here keeps getting noobs to run a full node and send their coins there, except even Core didn't have their shit fully developed prior to activation, which took months longer than was planned.  And then fees rose so now all these noobs who bought $100 and sent it to a non SW (gui side) supporting wallet can't justify paying 30% to move it to some other SW supporting wallet or exchange.  Thats not even considering the pain in the ass for them to even find what wallets support it, or exchanges do.  And thats assuming they even know WTF SW is and/or how to use it.
Your precious Core "engineers" fucked up, and the welcoming party of fucked up.

The 200PH comes from them stating not to mine with more than 5% of the total HP they've sold.  If one makes the assumption that KnC will not turn off their farm if they have no cloudhashing customers, then that implies they are (personally) mining with ~10PH.  Why ~10PH? Well because this is the approximate total HP of their entirety of their Neptune sales.  Thus, 0.05*X=10PH, X = 200PH.

[This guy]( figures the bitcoin network uses somewhere between 83.54MWhr and 8.354MWhr annually.  [These guys]( figure the city of Las Vegas used 180,000MWhr in 2009.   In fact, [The MIT review]( figures Google used ~260MWhr annually as calculated in September 2011.
Food for thought.


It doesn't *need* to be this "inefficient", as you put it.  Human greed has pushed it there.


I agree from the consumer side, but from the merchant end: it's a godsend.


This is a legitimate problem.  Hopefully whoever is involved with P2Pool makes it a little more palpable.


What does this have to do with Bitcoin being a bad idea?  Life is full of learning lessons.  Here's an example:  In the mid/late 90's there was an overlap between the Internet and Internet like services.  One of them, which I'm sure you've heard of, was AOL.  Now, AOL at the time was quite popular and one of the (ridiculous by modern terms) things they did was store the complete credit card number of the account, in plain text, in the user's management profile.  Not only was it stored in plaintext, but when you went to your account settings it actually listed the *complete* card number and expiration date associated with the account.  Now, people were "tech saavy" back then, but they weren't necessarily smart, and many, many AOL accounts were compromised through phishing (AOHell ring any bells?).  As a result, many, many people's cards were used for fraudelent purposes, and many, many teenagers across America received "free" shit ordered offline.
The point here is that yes, there will be learning lessons.  But having to learn those lessons, in the case of AOL, doesn't mean that the underlying technology was a bad idea, or that the concept of operations was faulty.  It just meant that the lesson had to be learned, and eventually it was.  Just like it will be here.
You credit yourself as a "Computer scientist", but I fail to see the scientist in your justification for Bitcoin being a "bad idea".

About 3TH should get you there if you were setting up today.

And by purchase price, I mean you ideally want to earn your $1,000 a month, plus the $3,000 outlay.

Depends on the operator's settings.  To sell you punch in a value in fiat and the machine gives you the rate.  If you say "yes" to the rate, it prints a receipt with an address/qr code for you to send the coins to.  You send the coins to the address and wait for one confirmation.  After the confirmation you scan/feed the printed receipt back into the atm and it spits out the cash in a mad fury.

If you go back in time and look at the exchange rate you'll see that Gox was always a good percentage higher.  People amounted this to Gox having Fiat withdrawal issues, and that was likely a partial driver.
In this space there's always a leader, and that leader was Gox.  It's no surprise that a drop on Huobi triggers a drop on Stamp and BTC-E.  Well, just take the biggest exchange and artificially crank the price up.  The rest will follow.

Huge risk.  Just sell miners and get rich today instead of betting millions on BTC's future tomorrow.

IIRC the protection was going to be held in place unless other manufacturers shipped in that time.  Seems like the network has grown some 14PH since then.  I'd call that other manufacturers shipping in quantity.


Is that supposed to put me at ease?  A big part of the issue is that at least with BTCGuild and ghash.io (to some level) individual miners like myself can leave to better balance the centralized pools.  With KnC, there is no such control.  That 20PH is controlled solely by them unless people opt to have their hardware pulled from free hosting and sent to them.  It's the same concept as the traded hashpower of cex.io.  How many people are buying there and then having the hardware shipped out to them?


I already have 1.2TH running and have been mining since late 2011, early 2012.

You're correct, however let's not forget that Bitcoin is more than just "digital money".  Further, what Bitcoin is today is not what Bitcoin could/would be if Google had gotten behind it in any sort of official capacity years ago.

Tragedy of the commons.  Specifically greed.
* The miners are greedy so they mine at GHASH.io because huge network share = moar profits (idiots).  Mine at GHash.io because of merged mining alts.
* GHASH.io doesn't limit its size because, hey, they're (miners) lining my pockets.

Which is fine, and I agree with you there.  It's the centralization and control of a few hands that's an issue.  Case-in-point: look at how responded recently to the ghash.io debacle.  That's nothing compared to what's going to happen if KnC comes to fruition.  At least with ghash.io individual miners had the power to leave and mine elsewhere.  Anyone being supported by KnC's mine (read: Neptune customers) does not have that control.

I disagree that the price exploded due to the halving.  The price shot up in April, four months after the halving.  People were well aware and was thus believed to have been priced in.
This one may be different in that previously the composition of miners was from smaller independent operators who were more likely to hold their coins.  Now we've got larger 'crop' mines who don't hold.  Their continued selling along with the increase of value since 2012 have made the effects of their selling that much more visible.
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:36:19


Anyone with half a brain in their head knows that the OP's comment is retarded in the context you place it, however it's not the context the OP published.  The title clearly implies he's talking to the people that were involved pre-$85.  For each and every person involved prior to that point, assuming they didn't try to daytrade themselves to riches or gave into capitulation, is sitting on a profit.  So in that aspect he's correct.
Further, you could have said the exact same thing in 2012 at the drop from the 30's, again in 2012 in the drop from the mid-20's, again in 2013 at the drop from $266.  I don't advocate people buy into BTC as some magical investment, but there's a real question as to if what *you're* parrotting has any value either.  Maybe *you* consistently have open shorts and it's in your best interest to steer people away and get them to bail.  FWIW, I doubt you have any open shorts, but it leads me to wonder what exactly your motivation is.  What is it that you have to gain from fighting the herd at every possible turn?  Are you just here to say "I told you so" when some people inevitably do poorly due to lack of understanding and experience?  What good does that do anyone?

First, my cost to mine a single BTC for is ~$103, if we get that low you can start to worry.
Second, Bitcoin operated just fine on a fraction of the hashpower that is now present.  I think you're grossly underestimating how much power is being thrown at the network.  You could take half of it away and it would still be a mind-blowing amount of computational power.

Please explain.


Pardon?  I am specifically talking about the TGB predictions *up to a year* from now.  The results are still garbage.
 &gt;Also, TGB not longer predicts the difficulty increase in months steps, but in 2-weeks steps (just like the bitcoin network).
This is a moot point.  It doesn't matter, the fundamentals of this calculator are flawed.


I have in the past.  You can check my post history.  In Nov 2013 I argued that the TGB was bullshit.  At that time it estimated that the diff in Jan would be 4B.  Further, it predicted that the diff would be 8B this month.  I countered with the prediction that it would likely be half of that (2B) for Jan.  
Whilst everyone here was throwing TGB results around yelling no ROI I purchased 1.2TH of Antminer S1's.  I've mined back 82% of the BTC I spent and will be in the black within the next 3 weeks.

OR:  I'll fork cgminer/bfgminer to withold wining blocks and spread it out to the miners and tell them to mine at GHASH.  We'll all get paid shares, but eventually GHASH's luck will be so shitty that you'd be a moron to stay.

I do, however it's trapped inside my skull.  Sharing it isn't so easy and I loathe people who need to be spoon fed.
The problem with the calculator is the fixed linear growth forecast.  It's extremely inaccurate and people push 'calculate' and then say: look, look, look at the numbers!!!  without giving a moments thought to how the numbers were generated and what they mean.  Of the people I have seen using that calculator, only a single (one) person has given any critical thought as to what it would take for the predicted values to come true.

One should really look at this from the other side.  If you were KnC would you spend millions of dollars to build a datacenter so that you could mine for your customers?  Keep in mind that this is costing them millions, and they'll be gaining/earning *nothing* while mining for the customers.  It would make way more business sense just to refund every single Neptune order and build it for yourself.  
KnC isn't doing this for altruistic reasons.

The difference is that AMD is not in the mining game, they are in the manufacturing video card game.  Thus, they would likely not go out and build some huge personal mining farm.  Anyone who could afford a video card could join and they wouldn't be at the mercy of AMD to produce more cards or start their own farm.
TL;DR: AMD does not have an incentive to control production and sales like mining ASIC manufacturers do.

Perhaps it is your arrogant tone that is soliciting these types of responses to your post(s).  


Because people are livid, and you're putting yourself between them and the people they're angry at.  How could one be surprised that this is what happens in such a scenario.  You're damn right they're sucking at communication.  They hired someone to rally the masses into their corral and make purchases.  Perhaps, just maybe, they should take some of the millions of dollars they've collected and hire someone who's job it is to take care of these things.  I'd bet they have someone on staff who's available to answer questions and take your money if you're thinking of ordering.
They'll take your order, even after they publicly posted that they were closing new orders.  On a Saturday night no less.  Oh, but once they've got your money, they're way too busy doing whatever it is they're doing to sit down for 10 minutes at the end of the day and post an honest transparent communication.


How about this. You're a guy that designs, builds, and sells gold mining equipment.  Of course you need to test this equipment to verify proper operation, so do you roll your excavator and washplant down to your customers claim and start mining their gold?   Or do you just go out back and dig holes and run clean dirt through the plant.  Need to test the plant?  Dump a (known) quantity of gold into your dirt and run it.  
They're obviously welcome to do what they want, but they're screwing their customers even if they aren't mining with customer units.  There is absolutely no need for them to be on the network mining real BTC short of their greed and unethical operation(s) which are becoming more painfully obvious every day.  There is absolutely no difference between the live network, test-net, or test-net in a box outside of the fact that you cannot spend coins from one network on another.

Then come up with some of your own.  Don't claim to be a scientist of sorts and then post a bunch of subjective opinions on why Bitcoin is bullshit.  Yes, the mining algorithm could run on a NES, but your comment makes me think you don't really understand the reasonong and requirement of mining outside of what the logic process of SHA256 is.


What are you even talking about?  What is this "head in the sand" business, and what are the lessons of the past?  It'd be nice if you actually had some points to defend instead of some blanket opinion you can't qualify.  It saddens me that you're laughing your ass off at people who have had unfortunate losses.  I suppose if all I cared about is monetary losses or gains I should be here laughing my ass off at you while my BTC has appreciated in value 100x and you're sitting there kicking rocks telling everyone how stupid Bitcoin is.


I disagree, and think you'd have to be "neck deep in some broken ideology" to think that disallowing chargebacks hurts everyone.  Why don't you go talk to the ebay sellers and see how they feel about your statement regarding chargebacks.

I don't care about network growth as a whole.  I care about the concentration of hash power under the complete control of a few hands.  It undermines the ideology of Bitcoin and puts the whole experiment at risk.
I didn't buy from KnC and I did not purchase a single "pre-order".  I have nothing to gain from KnC shipping as they promised, but the fact that they have apparently not held up their word to their customers doesn't put me at ease as they talk about creating the largest private farm in existence.  Especially when they openly state that the miners in their control will be run in a manner that "mines directly to your wallet".  
You can call me a petulant kid all you want, but I've been involved for a long time and am driven more by the ideals of the experiment than the quick money most of you/they are chasing today.  I am against their plan to manufacture and **centralize** what would now be considered **&gt;50%** of the network.  


Were you around when KnC announced their plans?  Did you witness who the majority of the people buying from them were?  In case you weren't, or need a memory refresh it was largely people who joined Bitcointalk during and immediately after the April 2013 runup from 13$ to $266.

Yeah, right.  Because on a no fee exchange I can buy for $200.00 and sell for $200.01 a hundred times a second and make money.  Go ahead and try that on an exchange with a fee and see how far you get.  So yes, trading is trading, but trade volume on a no fee exchange vs fee exchange are practically different.


And I suppose you have all the hard data from all of the exchanges to share?


Wait, didn't you *just* say that "only a tiny percentage of ..." implying you have all this mystery data?

No, you spewing words out isn't evidence.  It's hearsay.
Here's some help for you: 


If this were a court of law the defence would make a laughing stock out of you.  The defence would say something along the lines of: "Do you have any evidence?".  They would then ask if you were fired, and likely paint your statement as the actions of a desperate man seeking revenge on a former employer.  Note, this is outside of what I believe.


You're a crack-pot. 


No I am not.


What does that have to do with anything?  I'd hazard a guess that I'm closer to being a certifiable "expert" on mining than yourself.


No, I do not.

I would concede that it *can* be viewed this way, but in this context we're talking about the market absorbing the 94k without flinching because 250,000 BTC were traded.  That 94k would make a miniscule dent if 99% of that trade volume were market purchases, but would be further disastrous if 99% of that traded volume were market sells.  Without knowing the ratio of market sells to buys, it's hard to say what the effect of adding 94k BTC on the sell side would be.

Having lived through all of the crashes in real time, with the exception of the $32-$2, I can say that at least *I* am becoming less emotionally tied to drops and I can only surmise that it's the same for others as well. One could view it like this: what's worse, losing $10MM and only having $1MM left, or having $1MM and then only having $1?
As per the 20, I'm talking about the number of times Bitcoin has been officially declared dead in the media, not the number of times it's crashed.  If it's crashed 3 times and we're now at number 4, it didn't really die the other times, did it?

Some, sure.  *All*? Certainly not.  This also should not be an us vs. them situation.  


We are all in this together, and by the very definition of "users" the miners are users of the Bitcoin system too, even if it's for short term gains.  Further if "short term gains" is the division of where one's input matters, then you better start taking tabs on all of the speculative traders involved since that's why most of them are here too.


Are you saying that you honestly believe that miners aren't in to see a long and useful life of Bitcoin?  You should send a shout out to Bitfury and see if their views align with your interpretation.  While you're at it, ask Bitmain and KnC too.

The cold reality is that eventually we need a fee market to support mining.  The question is when and how should that develop.
If you make BTC so it scales to infinity holding only 0 fee transactions then the mining infrastructure falters until subsidy reduces to zero, where it ultimately fails.
The question is whether we need to focus on building a fee market *now*, or whether that can can be safely kicked down the road in lieu of increasing the userbase.

People already had large GPU farms prior to ASICS.  The upper bound for most of these farms was ~100GH.  There were real physical limitations on the scalability of these operations.   
These upper bounds meant that the gap between the casual miner and professional miner was much, much smaller than it is today.  Effectively this prevented centralization to the scale in which we're facing now.
So the point I'm trying to address is that we *were* all in the same boat and had equal access to mining hardware.  Sure, if you had a bunch more money you could buy more GPUs, but those with the money were still paying the same rates that the hobby guys were.  *It was an equal playing field*.

If the total cost to develop and implement the widget is X, the recurring cost to offer the widget for sale is Y, and my profit for selling the widget is Z...  THEN:  offering the widget is profitable (and I should continue doing so) iff Z\*(arbitrary unit of time n) &gt;= X+Y\*(arbitrary unit of time n).
Edit: So, while it seems that people don't understand there are costs involved, you're making the assumption that if it didn't pay off your initial costs in some small arbitrary amount of time you should quit selling it, irregardless if it will actually earn you money over a larger arbitrary amount of time.

Once it has stabilized:  Have Hearn draw up his post, get it to the media and have them all prepped.  Then BAM.  Hearn's leaving, Bitcoin has failed, and as icing on the cake R3 clears their books to paint the picture we see today.

In order to fire someone they must first be employed.  Get that through your head.  The majority of Core developers are *volunteers* on an *open source* project.  The only people that can be "fired" are the employees of Blockstream, and the only people that have the power to fire them are the administration of Blockstream.


If Core is full of devs who are going to take their ball and go home because they don't get their way, then they are part of Core to its detriment.  In the real world when you work in a team you compromise to move forward.  People that refuse to be a part of a *team* should be removed.


I have made no such assertion here, don't put words in my mouth.


Again, no it's NOT.  Core still has its repo and can do what they like.   If everyone *else* decides to use a competing implementation then great.  If that means that the Core devs want to throw in the towel, then they really don't give a shit about Bitcoin and its future.  If they care, then they will continue to develop on the platform that wins out.  To say and/or expect that they will all quit because they don't get their way is childish and amateur, and no amount of FUD hyperbole from reddit accounts that are 15 days old changes that.

Second, then, you're also stupid for not being on top of what was happening there, because pretty sure the vast vast majority was aware of what was going on.
My guess is either you didn't actually lose anything there, because you don't have anything to lose, or you sold off your BFX tokens for pennies on the dollar because you fell for the FUD, like an idiot.

Me and my ilk, how wonderful.  I don't subscribe to a "side", and I'm not here parading political bullshit.  I'm here saying that I can handle larger blocks, and this concept of keeping things so the lowest common denominator is looked after is fundamentally flawed given the network we have today.
Oddly enough, a year ago you were pissed at Blockstream for " taken upon itself to decide that block size doesn't need to be increased".
The fucking irony.

@_date: 2015-08-14 22:58:55
We can't see the number of 'hashers' assuming that's what you're using to describe an individual that mines.  But, we can see that there are more 'miners' if that's what you're calling entities all attempting to mine a block with the same set of transactions.


Truthfully we can't say for certain that centralization is happening because we don't know the composition of the 'unkown' slice, but if we say the 'unkown' is one or two entities, then we can say that decentralization is in fact what's happening.  Suffice to say, we don't actually know enough information to say *with certainty* that it's one or the other.


Anecdotal evidence doesn't count for much.  I'm the only person I know that was hashing in 2012, and I'm still the only person I know hashing.  Certainly we can't conclude much from either of our personal experiences.

Oh that's right. We ended up with the SW "compromise".  I remember when all these services had coded it up and it was ready, just needed to activate it.  Except entities weren't ready, pepole aren't using it, and it took your "behind closed doors" NYA to get it activated.
Then we have the whole "forks are hard and take a long time" which may be true, but Core isn't *really* working on any fork related stuff now, for activation *years from now*, are they?

Only a child would believe this.
Edit:  And no one is highjacking anything.  The users and Miners choose what code to run.  If no one agreed with SW and opt-in RBF and refused to upgrade to 0.12 and anything beyond, would that be a highjacking as well?


The majority, yes.  If a core devs leaves because of it then that shows that they only care about power and control, and Bitcoin does not need those type of people in those positions.  If a core devs accepts and moves forward with the project, then it shows that they care about Bitcoin, its potential for society, and (hopefully) their passion.  These are the kind of people Bitcoin needs in  these positions.
This us vs them, and the "I'm taking my ball and going home" mentality is childish and foolish.  Real engineering requires user input and compromise on both fronts.  There are things that I really don't like about Core, but I'm willing to compromise in favour of the things I do like.  If I lived my life stuck in a my way or the highway mindset I'd be miserable, nowhere, and likely an unemployed bum.

What kind of stupid is this?  Since when is a petrodactyl a "flying rainbow unicorn"


Maybe you should actually take a look at what the "core nodes" statistic is comprised of and use a little critical thinking of your own.


I have had a Bitcoin-QT node running since 2012.  I also now have a Classic node running as well as the QT node.
In my sample size of 1, it is a guarantee that people running Core nodes are running Classic nodes.   I'll concede my argument is premised off a shitty sample size, but at least I'm using real data instead of assumptions I've made up in my head *wink wink, nudge nudge*


A little premature, that.

@_date: 2016-02-27 22:03:25
Since you're interested in Economics: Miners go through "halving" moments all the time.  By this, I mean the rising difficulty.  A miner, assuming they have not increased their total hashrate, is earning 50% less than they were 2.5 months ago.  The halving can be reduced to a ~~50%~~ 100% increase in difficulty in one shot.  So look at history.  Identify the period of time where the difficulty has doubled and look at how miners adapted in those events.  That's, more-or-less, what they'll do when the halving happens.

You should look into the version of those core nodes.  From my node statistics the vast vast majority are 0.10 and older.

@_date: 2016-02-18 04:19:23


Oh it does?  Perhaps you have a source for that, but I fear it's just something you've made up to poorly bolster your untenable position.


What you continue to fail to see is what *versions* and *implementations* are included in your metric.  The vast, vast majority of those are either not standard core wallets, or versions 0.10 and older.  This doesn't support your argument if the existing nodes have been abandoned or are not maintained.  I want to see the number of people running a 0.12RC vs Classic.  But certainly you won't present that information because it would show the truth.

Are you speaking in the hypothetical scenario that there are enough consistent transactions to fill 20MB blocks?  Just want to make sure you're not of the mind that blocks would instantly be 20MB if the block cap was raised to that.
That aside, if you do your due diligence in choosing a VPS provider you can find affordable options with unlimited bandwidth.  Residential providers might get a little pissed though.
Edit: I just reread your post.  HDD space is quite cheap when configuring a VPS, RAM is much more costly.

It's not exactly clear. Core means Opt-in where I as a sender can opt into sending an RBF transaction. It does not do it by default. A lot of people feel it should be named opt-out since your Core node would be configured *by default* to relay RBF transactions.  It's a semantics argument.

There are varying methods of creating an ASIC.  IIRC what BTCFGA is doing is what's called structured or cell ASIC.  Essentially they'll take their FPGA bitstream and have it implemented in ASIC using standard logic blocks.  This is sometimes referred to as hardcopy, and doesn't require a mask set to be created.  
What BFL is (supposedly) doing is redesigning their bitstream from the ground up which involves 'hand placing' each transistor and interconnect on the metal layer.  This method is much (much, much,) more expensive and time consuming but has a greater payoff at the end of the day.

* They have run out of their supplier so they are now swapping to a new FPGA chip.
* Their solution only works with specific pools of their choosing, 
* The pool owner Inaba is an extremely dodgy character so I would not be surprised if they are skimming from the clients.

If he wants investors, then he should have waited until the legalities were settled and he was ready to move forward with that.
If he wants to give the community a heads up, he shouldn't have posted anything until he can say something along the lines of:  On XXX date, I'm starting my ASIC mining empire.

* Is your Mt. Red worker showing any submitted shares?  It's going to take quite some time before one shows up, I'd leave it running for at minimum an hour and see if any shares have been submitted.

When they had pre-orders available months ago it was pretty much vaporware.  Then they actually produced stock and shipped them out (Rev 1).  Rev 1 were essentially copies of the original prototype.  They were overheating and the power control circuitry wasn't up to par.  They then re-did the PCB improving the power circuitry (Rev 2) but heat was still a growing concern. 
 In the beginning of January BFL realized that something had to be done about the shitty heatsink they started with.  Since they had built but not shipped a lot of their January orders, they removed the heatsinks and replaced them with a proprietary heatsink design.  This however required the heatsinks to be designed, manufactured and shipped to BFL.  As the new heatsinks rolled in (And new-larger enclosures) they fit them to the original January orders and started shipping them out.  This is why the orders from January which should have shipped months ago didn't.  They held back the shipment to  upgrade the heatsinks. 
 Now that the current Rev (3) is a go, they're ramping up production.  They've cleared their backlog up to orders placed in the first week of February; it appears as though they shipped 4 weeks of orders in a week and a half.
  My 6 week deadline is April 25th. It's possible I'll see it by May 2nd I figure.

*  I have singles mining at a pool of my choice [!!!PROOF!!!](  If *you* had done your research you'd know that BFL's proprietary firmware update program has a built-in mining function which passes to Inaba's pool should you so choose to use their offering.  Any miner worth their salt is going to use an open-source miner and point at a pool of their choosing.
* What are all these signs?  Heresay != proof.  What findings that were posted directly implicate BFL utilizing previously deployed hardware?  Care to back that up?  I'm going to assume you created this whole imaginary concept from nghzang in [this thread](  That's great that you're using heresay from someone who's not (and never has been) associated with BFL, who's English is not their primary language as your source.
*  What does that have to do with their supply of chips for the singles?  The singles =!= the mini-rig.  It's a different product.  That's like getting pissed off that the V8 in the chevy pickup isn't the exact same V8 that's in the Corvette, they're both Chevies after all.  For all you/I/we know they'll create a second offering of the single at a greater price with the new hardware.  BFL never intended to use the Single's chip in the mini-rig.  Furthermore, it's been speculated [here](  Shouldn't you be out screaming to the world that GPU's are dead, ASIC is finally here!!!!  This seems to be all you need as factual proof.
*  From what I can tell Inaba knows how to properly debate and you.... not so much.  You have no facts to back up your proof and he called you out on that time after time. Your response is/was to resort to ad-hominem attacks and re-stating your arguements (again with no facts). [This about sums it up](
*  You claim that people are investing in BFL the company, not the product.  What options are being awarded to these "investors"?  What type of returns are you claiming that they're making?

Most mining pools have a built in wallet, also any exchange you use will have a wallet address for receiving transactions.  However, any sane person would have wallet and not rely on the exchange and pool to hold their BTC.

Bitcoin is quite the speculative investment vehicle.  Buying 60,000 BTC at 4.75$ and then selling at 5.25$ would net a $30,000 profit (before fees).  Obviously that's assuming you could buy and sell all of those coins at those values (which you can't by buying and selling the whole block at once, but if you throttle it obtain an average of those prices...
That's a return of ~10.5% if you manage it right.  Let's see your standard non-btc make a return like without completely fluking out or being privy to insider knowledge.

He operates a pool.  His options are limited, but I do agree with your sentiments about transaction verifications.   FWIW, 3k BTC is like 2-2.5 days worth of pool earnings, so it's not like he's left it there growing for months.  AFAIK, it's still unclear whether the hack happened in house or not (an employee of Linode).  Short of encrypting the drives by having initial access to the server, it's a risk you run with *any* cloud service.  Say he had been at em2, some employee there could have done exactly this. 
I'm not condoning the business practices on either side of the table, but it's less black and white than the operators were idiot businessmen.

What do already have available to you as a foundation for a miner? Do you just want to add some cards to what you have, or do you need to start from scratch?  I just built one, spent a bit over 500 though.
* 375$ 3x 5850 (6 months old @ 125usd ea)
* 90$   MSI 790fx-GD70 (Open box sale NCIXOutlet on ebay)
* 4gb   ram I scavanged from another machine
* 40$   AMD Athlon II 160u + heatsink 
* 100$ XFX 850W PSU (NCIX Online Sale)
* 5$     4GB USB Key 
You really need to know what you want out of this whole bitcoin mining thing and do your research.
The most sought after card is the 5970 due to it's achievable hash rate per card.
Best Bang for the Buck in order: 5830-&gt;5850-&gt;5870-&gt;5970.
The 6 series cards are much more expensive her MHash than the 5 series, but you can buy new 6 series w/warranties, not so on the 5 series.  5850 has a pretty stellar MH/J, not sure on the others but the 5830 and 5870 use quite a bit more power per hash than the 5850s

I'm not sold.  Partly because of what P4 has been asking (I have the same questions), inconsistencies in what Vlad has posted and other figures that just don't feel right.  Ex: "up to 2-3 orders of magnitude more power efficient and dense comparing to GPU based Bitcoin Miners"
He's implying that he's going to hit ~2.8 GH/W  Is that even possible?
Furthermore, he talks about how he's not greedy and will not try to 51% the whole thing, but previous to that he talks about how the futures of the company will be by investor vote.  Do we really think the players who the have money (the same type of guys who drove the US economy into the shitter for their profit margins) will all of sudden be so respectful of something like the 51% problem?  What if he gets removed from the board by the investors and they drive the thing into the ground?  
Aside from that, so he posted that he's selling equipment.  So? Maybe he's getting out, and as a last f-you to the community pulled this stunt.  Maybe he's going FPGA.  Maybe he's not actually selling anything but threw up the FS post to add fuel to the fire.
Either way, I'm pretty skeptical.  That doesn't mean it's complete BS, but shit just isn't adding up.  That aside I've no idea who's going to invest heavily with some random guy from the UK with some supposedly brilliant idea surrounding some crypto-currency in its infancy. Especially when powers like the US haven't definitively ruled on its legality as far as they're concerned (I'm not American btw.) when a majority of the users of BTC are American.
@_date: 2012-05-02 10:46:27
Yes and no.  You're correct up until "one day per BTC".  I have a moderate sized mining farm and I "produce" ~2.75 BTC/day at the current difficulty.  That aside. The model calls for a block to be solved every 10 minutes.  Of course the actual time varies but the target is, in fact, a block every 10 minutes.  Competition is fierce, so people join co-operative mining pools.  Miners of said pools get payouts depending on how much work they've done in a given period of time in relation to the method in which a pool decides how proceeds are to be dispersed.  Furthermore, you don't *need* a wallet, but it's highly recommended but, as you put it, a miner is required.

Mining a block creates the next link (block) in the block chain.  It is theoretically possible for someone to create a branch (chain splits into more than 1 path).  The math behind it states that the malicious chain will be behind the legitimate chain by a value of 1. (Chain = n, fake chain= n-1).  This idea lends to the probability that the fake chain will always be behind the legitimate chain by 1 and if it starts to fall behind the liklihood that it will catch up and pass the real chain (grows faster than the real one)  decays exponentially.  However, if you have &gt;51% of the hashing power its becomes possible for the fake chain to build faster than the real chain, and overtime the n-1 placement of the fake chain overcomes that of the real one and now you've got problems because the fake chain will now build faster than the real chain and the whole thing falls apart.

If your budget is 100$, you can either a) buy a used 5830 at your convenience, or try to find a good deal on a used 5850 locally for 100$.  You might find that you can get a 5850 for 120 in which case I'd say find another 20$ to buy it over a 5830.

*  They're not making any claims that are unmet with the exception of shipping times which they've addressed.  They have no requirement(s) to disclose or disprove any information relating to your allegations..  The problem is, you're making statements as if they're fact, not specualtion and you've absolutely nothing but heresay and assumptions to back them up.  If you want to make your claims that's fine, but you cannot state them as fact when they're not factually verifiable. hence my request for citations.
*  My own proof is a damn sight more than anything you've provided to back up any of your wild accusations.  As Inaba asked, what would constitute acceptable proof?  Do you need me to connect my two units to a pool worker of your choice for 1000 shares? Doubtful, it seems you need to feel/hold/molest one in your own hands with your own machine to accept these ideas.  You're simply not going to get it unless you buy one yourself, which you won't.  More so, you simply refuse to accept the fact that you may be wrong, and have approached this whole topic with a closed mind.  You *refuse* to be proven wrong, that is not my problem or anyone else's but your own.  I don't need to further defend myself or refute your claims because anyone with a sane mind will reach this conclusion on their own.
*  Again, end of life chips doesnt mean second-hand.  End of life means old technology that is no longer being manufactured and/or actively supported.  In computer-speak they often call these things legacy hardware.  IMO 6 months of warranty gives the end-user a warranty that lasts long enough for the unit to pay for itself, after that it's fair game.  Furthermore, try to find any publicly posted MTBF numbers for these FPGAs in a continually stress-tested environment.  How is BFL even supposed to make estimates that may potentially sink their business?  IMO, Chip lapping was done in efforts to protect their IP.  One fact (source available on request) is that they removed the required resistor that enables JTAG querying.  The missing resistor lends more credibility to the protecting IP possibility than your outright assertion they're using hardware that was previously deployed.  Maybe if instead of lapped chip surfaces there were odd markings on the chips that were inconsistant across samples you'd have some empirical data leading towards your assumption, but there just simply isn't any.  As for the price, perhaps the engineers at BFL saw the inefficiencies in the current SPARTAN bitstreams and knew it was a matter of time before the spartan speeds approached the BFL's.  Who knows, not you or I.  If you're talking about the purchase price of the chip, then you've already been educated on supply and demand and how it relates to EOL hardware,  I'm not going to re-iterate what you've already been told.  Hiding the chip, again IP protections.
**Summary**:  Finally!  Your last sentence is all that was needed.  In your original post the sentence structure you used implied all of these things as fact, not as "reasonable conclusions based on all evidence available".  While I think using the term reasonable is a far stretch, I'll accept it since you're probably not privy to the inner workins of that whole industry.
@_date: 2012-03-26 17:57:08
IMO No.  If you want to count Tradehill, Linode attacks, FinCEN rulings, market manipulation and subsequent lemming reactions then maybe you could find some basis for the reduced price.  It's a small volatile market.  So it dropped 25%, it also went up 350% Sept-December. It's going to go down, then up, then down, then up. 
TL;DR:  Bitcoin price is a yo-yo.  It does what it does.

* The inability to use it as a payment method for normal goods isn't a design flaw.  It's just not been adopted to the point where it's a globally accepted method of payment.  Try to buy your groceries in US with Euros or Pounds, see how far you get.  Go to Russia and try to buy vodka with CAD and see what happens.  If you want to go a step lower, go anywhere and try to buy something with a gold nugget.  I guess that means all currencies have a massive design flaw if you need an exchange at some point to use it.
* That's their own fault, not bitcoins.  Furthermore, I don't think "all businesses", as in: every single one; has been hacked.  If they have, then they shit the bed.  Are you going to blame the government when someone pick-pockets your wallet, or robs your local bank at gun point?
* I don't think wallet encryption was a  huge concern when they were designing a fucking *currency/commodity system*.  Maybe people who are trying to protect large stashes of coins should be pro-active and encrypt their own wallets.  Microsoft has backup features built-in to windows, but unless you, the user, set them up, they're useless.  Why can't someone protect their wallet properly?  Surely you'd at least buy a safe if you were keeping a crap load of gold at your house, wouldn't you?  Or would you just keep it in a kitchen cupboard and then blame the universe when someone steals it?
* Transfers happen near instantly.  What you're waiting for is for the block holding your transaction to be buried under enough future blocks mitigating the risk of the one holding your transaction to be orphaned before letting the coins be available for re-spending (preventing double-spending).  Have you ever sent a bank-wire?  You could send your coins and have them confirmed before the average person could get to the bank, wait for service, fill out the paperwork and commit the transfer to the network.
*  I personally don't think it was ever meant to replace the dollar.  In fact, thinking that BTC could replace something like the USD in its entirety is pure lunacy.
* It seems you're trying to apply a model to bitcoin for which bitcoin was never intended to fit. 
     In 1995 the internet was a weird wild place.  First, it was extremely technically involved to get onto it.  In fact; before Windows 95 came along, you had to have a specific release of Windows to even have TCP/UDP functionality (See Win 3.1 vs. 3.11) which are the fundamental protocols on which the net operates.  Not only that, you couldn't actually *buy* anything on the internet either since in its public infancy it was essentially just a massive blog-fest.  Finally, when e-commerce first began, people had *no idea* what they were getting into.  Credit Card fraud was RAMPANT, there were virtually no checks and balances.  Want to know another funny tid-bit?  At this point AOL was still massive (remember when they would send out 11ty CD's a week to your house?) and people would go on there phishing for other people's passwords by acting as AOL staff.  Once a password was phished you could log onto the victim's account and get their credit card number... AOL STORED THEM IN PLAIN TEXT IN YOUR USER ACCOUNT SETTINGS!  This was long before Joe Averaged started "surfing", before anyone knew better let alone understood what it was that they were even using. Shall we even introduce the credit number generating apps that were floating around during this period?  Not one piece of the e-financial puzzle was linked in real-time.
     My point is this:  While your concerns may have some validity (albeit small), your issues with bitcoin are nothing less than those people had about the internet in the mid-90's.  How many people do you think laughed at others over the mention of "the internet"?  I'll give you hint: A LOT; but now look at what this place has become.  The internet has changed the *world* in a way that at the time was inconceivable, and maybe, just maybe, bitcoin can do the same for at least some part of the monetary system.  Like the internet, it's going to take quite some time to make or break, and in that time all the issues you have will erode.  I don't know when it was exactly, but it wasn't that long ago (months?) where the first plug-and play implementable bitcoin transaction modules were made available to e-retailers.  I'm real curious to see where BTC will be in 5 years, which if applied to the internet growth timeline is about the time the first broad band connections became available.

High end?  5970's.  Low End? 5850's.
So 3 5970's would be ~ 2400 MHash at $1200 just for the card.,
Or 6 5850's would be  ~ 2400 MHash at $750 just for the cards.
The 5970's would theoretically use 1.05 kW/Hr,
The 5850's would theoretically use 1.05 kW/Hr
Figure  at least 250 for a PSU,
150 for  Mobo,
45 for Proc,
15 for Ram,
10 for USB Flash Drive.

If there isn't enough liquidity then guy a's force close may push the price higher than guy b's force close price so then *he* gets forced closed which force closes C and so on...
That's a short squeeze.

@_date: 2015-04-26 19:14:26
was correct, I think you're missing my point.
Exchanges don't make buy/sells on the blockchain.  
Ex: user a deposits coins on exchange, user b buys coin from user a, and user b sells to user c, and user c withdraws said coins.  In this example there is no blockchain link that goes a's address -&gt; b's address -&gt; c's address.  What you see is a sends to the exchange's address, and c receives from the exchange's address.  What occurs in the middle happens internally to the exchange.
At no point in the internal transactions do any of those coins have to actually exist until c attempts to withdraw.  This is what I mean by an exchange can naked short.  They have complete control over a database that *represents* user deposits.  As long as the exchange trades against a, which they can because they have (near) complete knowledge of a's position such that at the end a has less coins on file (read: a has less coins to withdraw than originally deposited), they can keep the difference without have ever actually having had any coins.  Hence, the naked short.

I don't think this is so cut and dry.  There was the alleged scrypt mining which was never proved, and there was BTC mining which the HW order was verified.  There were two mining locations and the one in question is the facility that the BTC mining was said to be housing.  So we know some mining was occurring.  We also know that GAW was charging users maintenance but not paying their power bill, nor were they giving users mined BTC.

I would hazard a suggestion that the fractalization of exchanges has aided them immensely.

Here's a possibility:  You run this '21 Miner' on the 21 pool.  21's DB backend tracks your earnings but keeps the entire pile of coin (all users mined earnings) in one address.  You use the 21 HW to make a micro-transaction.  This micro-transaction is recorded in a centralized database at 21 Inc.  Perhaps once a day, or Once a week, or on demand, a person *collecting* micro-transactions from 21 HW users can request payout.  On request, 21 Inc collects all the micro-transactions listed in their centralized database and makes a single on-chain transaction to the recipient with a total value of the sum of all collected micro-transactions.
I think people need to start thinking outside of the box on this.  There was a Whaleclub teamspeak where a 21 Engineer joined and chatted about it.  The implications of his input were pretty amazing.

Option A:  I can sell the machine for 20% less than I could potentially mine with it if all of *today's* mining variables stay consistent across time.
Option B: I can mine and *hope* that I make the theoretical max income as long as all of *today's* projections remain valid.
In case of option A, I am guaranteed my profit, here and now.  I don't need to assume the risks inherent with mining, of which there are many.
In case of option B, I'm *hoping* that my projections are correct, that an "act of god" doesn't destroy my farm, that my farm operator isn't skimming BTC off the top, that I can maintain uptime, that I can pay the overhead of a facility, employee fees, and power fees.  And above all of that, that my HW remains competitive enough over time.
If your risk appetite is low, it may be a much wiser move to sell the HW to end users at a slight loss on potential profit than to take the risk of mining a bit more over time.  This doesn't even consider the FV vs PV on the potential profit, nor does it address the possible opportunity costs of option B.
Also, many people have made a shit load off of speculation with their mining rewards (holding vs immediately selling).

Forget electricity costs.  The purpose here is to mine with a device that you would normally not give a crap about the power.  Do you look at your elec bill at the end of the month and break down how much your modem used? Your TV?  Put this in the same class as those devices.

If it's embedded in a connected device but cost you $0.25 a month in power, regardless of what it mines, are you ever going to really notice or care?  Let's say your answer is no.  Then multiply that by a million (billion?) people and there's your large numbers with people mining at a loss.

You're making the assumption that I didn't sell off when they were $15, $100, or any price up to $1100, and that I had, at any point, a significant amount of BTC.


It's not just a motivational speech. It's the *truth*.  Did you think that the successful people in the world got there by saying, "oh I wanted to do x, but I couldn't because y".  No, they got creative and did what they had to do to achieve their goals.


Same sentiment people had in 2011 and 2012.


Again, you're assuming that the people involved in 2011 saved through all of the ups and downs.  I believe the opposite, I believe that the bulk of people who were involved back then have sold off their hoards, and only a few remain.  
Further, you have no idea where BTC is going, and neither do I.  If OP manages to get 20 BTC and in 5 years they're worth $10,000 a piece then does that equate to "pocket change"?


I agree that it's an oversimplification, but I don't think think it's largely untrue.


It's not incredibly funny. It's the foundation for a lot of things in life.  I wanted a hopped up import. I couldn't afford to buy one, so I worked hard and built one.  I wanted to become an Engineer so I went back and redid high school level classes, worked my ass off and became one.

Not exactly.  I took a risk, and it paid off (yay) but what I didn't do was sit there and come up with excuses as to why I couldn't get involved.  Maybe OP has some skills he could provide and take BTC as payment.  Maybe OP could get $25 of BTC and learn how to read markets and try to start trading it.  Maybe OP could do what my sister did and visit faucet type sites everyday until he/she has amassed 1BTC from dust transactions.
There are a lot of creative ways to get coins, some riskier than others, but the largest thing standing in OPs way is excuses like 'I'm still in college'.

Further, Bitcoin wasn't necessarily supposed to provide settlement.  It is supposed to be a cash system.  The whitepaper is literally titled  "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"
Bitcoin already functions like a currency, we dont need LN for that.  What LN strives to do is provide a settlement layer *on top* of Bitcoin.

The miners with 95% will keep mining and the XT and Classic nodes will keep validating.  The Core (and other non 2MB) implementations will stay on the small block chain.  Given that there is only now 5% of the original hashpower on the slow chain, the slow chain will not find blocks for a long f'ing time.  The chain will grind to a halt and transactions will no longer be processed in a reasonable amount of time, if ever.  
If the 95% miners go to 2MB the small chain will have to fork to reduce the difficulty and likely switch PoW algorithms so "nefarious" actors don't fuck it into the ground.

  Others are either in the same place you are and making the same gamble, or have been mining for some time.  The April bubble brought hoards of new people all looking for a slice of the "free money", and you're now contending with them for a slice of the pie.  Conversely, a lot of us have been mining for a (relatively) long time which put us in position to be the early adopters of new tech.  I'm not sure when you heard about Bitcoin, but ASIC pre-orders started in June of 2012.  Historically, bitcoin has favoured the early adopters and in terms of the ASIC game, you're near a year late.
  
  As someone who's been mining for almost 2 years, both with a fairly substantial GPU farm and (now) ASIC powered hardware, I will not be ordering anything else until mid 2014.  
  
  
  &gt;Bitcoin is young and while 3600 coins are still being mined per day, I think its worth it.
  
  The real question is: is it worth it to buy a miner and gamble that you'll earn back the amount of coins, or better to just take your 2K and buy the coins outright.
@_date: 2013-12-21 05:08:35
Not really.  I've been in BTC since the mid 4$ range.  Sounds like the lot of  Dogecoin users are the butthurt ones.  To each their own I suppose.
But really, you should probably go hard on Dogecoin.  Like, seriously, because in 2505 Brawndo is going to start taking DGC for sure.

Gear down big rig.  If you order some silicon, you're going to get some silicon.  Time will tell if the design and all of the supporting hardware and software works.  We're still a long ways off.  It also concerns me that KnC is committing to inflated hash rates as if they were a certainty when they have yet to receive an ES of their device.
@_date: 2013-11-01 04:44:05
Firmware, Bios etc != hardware.  Unless you can tell me how written code can alter the physical structure of hardware I'm not buying it.  Secondly it's a hell of a stretch to assume that some random snippet of code is going to be able to update your system BIOS.  Why don't you download the bios for a random ASUS board and then try to flash it to a random MSI board, let me know how that goes for you.  Or are you implying there's a master somewhere that has a database of every possible BIOS variant used in consumer PCs and just selects the one it needs?

I orderd a B2 Avalon and was one of the chosen ones to receive them during their "test shipment", it has long paid itself off in BTC -&gt; BTC terms.  
  
  It's been very difficult, but I haven't pre-ordered anything since.  I saw this coming, and IMO the difficulty increase is only getting warmed up.

  I'm curious as to what this homework you've done consists of.  
  
  &gt;I think it's more likely they'll ship on time than won't.
  Why? Because they employed ORSoC for their design?  BFL used Chronicle Tech (who often works for Boradcomm) and yet..?


  
  So you're going to ignore the development history of those who have run through and completed their designs already in lieu of 'small sample' size?  Tell me again about this homework you've done?

  We don't have a way to say either way, but I'd hazard a bet that a lot more is actually *spent* through silkroad than the rest of the bitcoin economy.


  &gt;The price is unstable, because the market is constantly changing and we lack the liquidity of more mature financial instruments.
The price is unstable because it's easily manipulable by those with either a) enough BTC, or b) enough fiat.  The market is also unregulated which opens it up to all sorts of devious market tactics that are barred from traditional trade markets.
  You're correct though, that through using coinbase there is marginal (near, but non-zero), risk to the merchant.  However, there is great **risk to the consumer**.

You raise an interesting point.  I earned much less per day during the GPU era than I do now, but the key difference was that the difficulty was fairly stable and predictable.  You could purchase hardware and have a reasonable expectation that it would reach a postive return in ~3 months.  The scene has drastically changed since then.

It would seem that yes, the author is implying that these groups of mined coins were done on a single machine by the consistent rate of increase (and del_t to overflow) of the extranoncevalue.
However, the author is not implying that all coins mined that remain unspent must belong to the same person.

How has the first already been set?  AFAIK, Pirateat40 is the first person to be charged for committing state crimes in the Bitcoin economy.  The precedent set is that if you're American and operating schemes/scams like these, you're not untouchable just because the alleged act occurred in a virtual economy.  This just might deter some other asshat from doing something similar since they now know they're not immune to the law because Bitcoin.
  
  I'd take a look at the big picture.  The American government can and will intervene wherever they damn well please.  It doesn't matter whether you're operating in a virtual economy, if you're American, you're subject to US laws...  Hell, if the US had their way, everyone on the face of the planet would be subject to their laws.

It hasn't been stated directly, but it's pretty obvious.   Chips are made in Taiwan.  Units are assembled in Shenzen and ship from Hong Kong.
Edit:  Obviously lack of communication is the real issue here.  Did Bitsyncom ever state that the Avalon ICs were shipping directly from TSMC?  I would have assumed they would be bulked shipped to Bitsyncom's China headquarters, re-packaged and then shipped out.

Hardly.  Sounds more like some arbitrary trend you've developed.  


  
  So you're openly okay with being ignorant with the big picture?  This isn't an Avalon thread, if it was, I'd probably be here boasting the same opine.  
  &gt;Your definitely blowing out of proportion the effect that a 30k purchase would have one someones long term livelyhood. Hint, almost 0.  
  
  How brazen of you to think that making financial gambles of $30,000 dollars doesn't/won't effect the livelihood of every single person who ordered.  You sound like an American of the "I want it now" generation.  


  
  That's laughable.  There are certainly more than the 2 arbitrary types of "ragers" that you've so eloquently outlined.  Fact is, it's highly likely I've been mining long before you even heard of bitcoin.  I'm not easily blinded by greed and certainly wasn't stupid enough to purchase anything from BFL from June 2012 to now.  I left that to the uneducated people who's eyes are bigger than their brains, the same type of people who keep calling all of the modern miners "ASICs".  
  
  
  &gt;A real business man knows how to roll with the punches. Doesn't over extend. Doesn't over invest in any one thing. Knows what risks he is taking when he parts with his money. Accepts when shit happens its not the end of the world.
These types of people are the grown ups. The guys that have successfully run large businesses and make lots of money in the long run. They don't let temporary setbacks or delays ruin them or their emotional state.
  Maybe in a standard business, sure.  Again, this isn't a traditional business and you know it.  Mining is a race to the bottom.  You can sit here and justify the delays and blindly smile all you want, but this rhetoric of "don't let temporary setbacks or delays ruin them" is a fallacy.  How much longer are you prepared to wait?  Are you going to be okay at the end of September when BFL says: "Sorry guys, we're just missing some parts because this box broke open on shipping and well, IDK... Looks like two more weeks."?   How about when your unit still hasn't arrived by end of october and KNC, Hashfast, and Bitfury Ph2 are shipping?  What then?  Still just going to roll with the punches as your ignorance to the state of affairs whittles down your investment to nothing?


  Good luck with that 10x return.  I sincerely hope you purchased in April when BTC was at $260, because if you didn't:  you're not going to make anywhere near a 10x the BTC it cost you.
I share the same sentiment as the last three paragraphs.  Then why, pray tell, are you here trying to instill confidence in BFL when people are inquiring about purchasing from them, or whether they should (or have) began processing a refund?  You admit that it's primarily a fool's game, do you really find pleasure in fucking the innocent?

  BFL didn't claim to be finishing their design for the ASIC last OCT/NOV.  They claimed to be shipping in OCT.  That means the ASIC design had to be complete *at minimum* by August of 2013.  
  
  
  &gt;  2) they are like OH shit, thats not good. We have to re-design the board and cooling to accommodate our real world tests that didn't match what our theoretical model predicted.
   No, they were like: "OH shit, thats not good.  We have to change from QFN to BGA."  They then laughed at Bitsyncom because they were continuing with QFN and so was ASICMiner and speculated they were going to fail miserably.  Well, in hindsight we all know how that went, don't we?  They didn't even realize they had power issues until the BGA packaged chips were received *after* dealing with the temperature issues.  
  
  
  &gt;3) 6 month delay ensues while they start over from almost scratch to redesign PCB, Case, power supply, etc.  
  
  It does not take 6 months to redesign a PCB, case, or power supply.  Further, BFL themselves stated they could re-design and have new-boards back in just over 48 hours.  That couldn't have possibly been another lie, could it?  
  
  
  &gt;4) bitcoin community the majority of which isn't able to read between the lines doesn't understand what just happened and how fucked the situation is, but they will. Pitchforks and torches get taken out of storage.
  That wouldn't have anything to do with the fact that the community was continually lied to, would it?
  
  &gt;5) in the meantime, I wait, knowing exactly what is going on for the tidal wave of dumbasses who were expecting 5000% returns on their money in the first 30 days all give up and cancel. I laugh because in my line of work, getting a return on your money in the first 12 months is fucking awesome.  
  
  Unless you have insider knowledge, you *don't* know what's going on.  You know what they tell you, and the assumptions you make along with the conclusions you reach from the misinformation and assumptions you're operating from.  
  
  &gt;So in short, I am not defending BFL more then I am calling out dumbasses for getting into a "business" that they had no ability, understanding, or patience to be in the first place. This amuses me to no end and I thank you for your words. It validates my existence on this forum.  
  If there was any truth to this, you would have nothing to do with BFL.  You would have done what I did and refused to get involved.  The opportunity costs lost by each and every person who was blinded by greed and outlandish claims is insane.  This isn't a traditional market, you and I both know it.  Everytime you spew your support for BFL you further strengthen the impulses of the "dumbasses ... getting into a "business" that they had no ability, understanding, or patience to be in the first place."  You share culpability in their poor choices.

Then why aren't you telling people to go out buy GPU's.  They can start participating TODAY.  Sure, they may have to "wait" until they earn much in the way of BTC, but that's okay right?  Why don't you tell them to go buy ASICMiner gear?  They can start participating within the week, hell, they'll even earn BTC faster than with the GPU!  But, noooooo, you seem to think ordering from BFL is a brilliant idea, because they told you it was.  Hell, you're more than happy to wait, since that what this game is after all, isn't it?  Go ask any miner who was actually mining pre-2013 and ask them what the most important factor is when considering the purchase of mining gear is, then tell me again about how happy other people should be to wait after being lied to time and time again.

Dogecoin didn't even exist last month.  Are you saying that there's been 10,000 people who have been wanting to get involved with digital currencies since before dogecoin existed and *none* of the hundred other alts fit the bill?  People can still mine Bitcoin, litecoin, feathercoin, BBQCoin, Quarkcoin etc.  
Edit: Could you fill me in a bit on the "actual push" part?  I get a headache every time I try to read the "doge" broken English.

And here you are making a lot of assumptions.  The point you're missing is that you're comparing a product ready to ship today (profitable or not) to a vapourware device that's "shipping in September".   
   
That is what I'm circling as a poor example.    
  
  As for KNC. There's no guarantee they'll have anything to ship by September. As per them being "profitable",  let's not even go into the realm of the possible difficulty come September, which will be long after Avalon ships their chips, BFL (maybe) ships their queue and chips, Asicminer sales (and internal mining), Bitfury/Metabank finishes their production run (of which they have working engineering samples), and who knows what other company shows up with hardware for sale.  How profitable will KNC units be if difficulty is through the roof and the price of a coin falls below 50?

That assumes that "most people" were members of bitcointalk at the end of June.  That "most people" had the capital right then and there to make a purchase.  That "most people" acted blindly without doing any due-diligence.  That "most people" ordered that week and that week only.  I'll concede that a large volume of orders were placed then, but to say "well over 50% of the order book has already shipped" is fundamentally flawed in so many capacities I don't even know where to start.  That's *aside* from the fact that even if your numbers were correct, you're implying that somehow they're going to ship the same volume it took them four months to get out the door in under 30 days.  There has been some speculation that BFL has ~6PH on the books. We haven't even breached a single PH from everything shipped by every vendor thus far.   You really should go back to the numbers you're using to generate your assumptions and try to find where you fucked up.  
  
  &gt;With all this information combined, it would allow me to extrapolate the reasonable timeframe they claim to be fairly accurate.
  Your information and assumptions are flawed.  I'd hazard a guess that if you *actually* did any extrapolation you used linear models.  That's not going to suffice.  Unless you can produce  a differential equation and all of the functions you generated to form that DE then you might as well be pulling numbers out of a hat (or your ass).

I don't have enough information to make an educated guess.  Earlier is always better, the question is: by how much?

Saying that more orders were placed in first 7 days than the cumulative 260 days that follow is not logical.  
  
   &gt;I'm not implying it, they straight up said it in official communications multiple times. The latest being a mass email to all the customers that happened just a few days ago.
   And they're "straight up" full of shit.  That's the point.  You're here attempting to defend and validate their BS when any rationally sane personal with an IQ even remotely above that of the US average would immediately realize otherwise.
  
  &gt;I assure you, I have all the most up-to-date info available to the general public.  
  
  I assure you that the information you've been given is BS.  You're the same type of person that would have been here in October "assuring" everyone that BFL *will* delivery by the end of the month because they said so.  The same type of person that would have "assured" everyone that they would be delivered just before or after christmas because "they said so".  You fail to realize that they'll tell you whatever you want to hear, and you'll believe it because of your blind optimism.
  
  You're welcome to your personal optimism, but if I see you posting this garbage here, I'll make it my duty to oppose what you say.  I do not want people getting caught up in that shit show.  
  
  &gt;it is in the realm of possibility, and therefore would like to think positively that they will actually not fuck this up.
  You suffer from stockholm syndrome.  Please, do us all a favour and stop trying to trap others into whatever vicious cycle of false hope and promises you're currently experiencing.
@_date: 2013-06-17 17:34:31


And there lies the problem.  People ordered on Feb 2, 2013 under the presumption that they would delivery by April 15, 2013 at the latest as advertised.  The earliest units ordered on that date started showing up at the end of May.  1.5 months of lost mining during that time is worth ~168 BTC, or ~$20,000 of lost earnings.  If production was delayed, so be it, but to find out you lost $20K because they were mining with your unit is a little tough to swallow.  


I suppose you'd be totally cool with buying a brand new exotic car, receiving it 2 months later than you were told only to find out it has 10,000KM (6,250Mi) on it because of "testing".

Yeah, BFL creates shill accounts and starts buying the orders back at fractions of the purchase BTC.
@_date: 2013-09-09 18:42:27
My understanding is there's a cach to that.  A sale is not considered a "sale" until the product has changed hands.  Since BFL has not delivered on their end of the agreement, no sale has yet been completed.

There's also btcfgpa which folded but had missed their dates as well.  So far, only one, if any, has managed to conceivably meet their own deadlines.  How many other groups are out there?

I may be mistaken, but I think Canada's stance on BTC is that it's more like a virtual token than a currency.  Effectively, the exchanges, according to FiNTRAC are not required to follow our version of KYC and AML laws since you're using your CAD to purchase a "token".  Thus it is a good and/or service, thus the GST (and PST if applicable).
I don't know if you listened the podcast where CAV CEO talked about their operations, but they're trying to comply with all laws and regulations, even if FINTRAC has stated they do not need to.  Which pretty much explains their inclusion of GST and following KYC and AML laws even though (at this time) they're not required to.

To be honest, a lot of people take Bitcoin pretty seriously because (IMO) it is.  I haven't really taken a moment to even look at or think about Dogecoin, but from the outside it looks like a bunch of highschool kids running around blurting out their inside joke all day long.
I once dated this girl, she and her friends had in inside joke where the word 'purple' was synonymous with 'meh' or indifference.  They'd go around answering peoples questions with 'purple'.  Ex: I was thinking of making some rosemary chicken for dinner tonight, what would you like for sides?  Their answer? PURPLE.
Now, to anyone who's not in their teenage clique, the response is useless, and to be honest, made them look like idiots to anyone who wasn't in on the joke.   That's how  I view Dogecoin.  It strikes me as a bunch of kids joking around.  It doesn't seem (to me) to be on the level where nation states are having hearings with their top officials trying to figure out what the hell to do with this new, possible threatening, technology.
