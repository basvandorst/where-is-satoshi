If, by 2020, one million USD is about what 10k is now, the value of BTC is the least of our worries.

"everyone loves America" you're stating this as fact, you're clearly totally sheltered if you truly believe this. 
Ever travel outside the US and have many people agree with you? Thought not.
The Americans are by no measure the most free, nor are they the most happy, nor are they the most healthy. I'm excited to see what shilly argument you can come up with to make your point.
You're what normal people call "too far gone", or maybe in certain places they'd say; " this guy has his head so far up his own ass he can breathe through his esophagus."

There's a documentary about how defense money was spent under Bush, watch that if you haven't yet. It's called Iraq for sale.
These things are not just happening once, they're the main reason this country is at war; it helps the gdp and on a much larger scale the military industrial complex.

Watch the documentary, it's not about spending vs not spending, it's about what it's spent on.. private contractors and mercenaries who have no oversight.. preeeeeeetty sure there's not a mention that a certain amount of military spending needs to fund mercenaries in the Constitution.
I don't have the same reverence for a document that's over two hundred year's old and was written in a very different global state. Treating any one source as the end all be all is intellectually lazy, and so we have different starting points.
I will not robotically follow text just because it's written by people I respect. 
The Constitution is meant to be a living document, the people who came up with it were absolute units. But this was written when Britain was breathing in the US's neck, when larger forces were threatening the US, the US is now unambiguously the largest force on Earth. Strategies change. Context changes.
Lastly, I hope you're up in arms about what's happening to Julian Assange and why the US hasn't dropped any and all support for MBS, since the first amendment has been pretty violated lately.

I believe Bitcoin's energy use is for the larger part renewable energy. It's about finding the cheapest way to mine, which happens to be; find a really cold place and use renewable energy.

Did you get a small loan of a million dollars?

You're freaking out over taxes while people die of poverty/lack of affordable healthcare or suffer under unreasonable, inequality has never been bigger. What good is all the money in the pockets of the owner class when the normal people can barely pay for their next doctor's visit, or dread the results from an 'expensive diagnosis'.

Citation needed, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about. 
Ever even been to Europe?
Congratulations on proving that the most expensive hospitals could be top hospitals, I would damn hope so.

the Netherlands and Germany, Finland, definitely known to be very un-innovative countries depending on the US..
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:17:35
Yeah, crazy stuff like this happens in northern Europe and Western Europe all the time! /s

Lol, have you? I've been to Finland, Norway, Denmark, grew up about 500 yds from the Dutch border, in Belgium, y'know, where there are basically no natural resources and a large population in comparison. 
"The Nordic model is extremely new and really hasn’t been put under much stress."
This 'neo-American' oligarchy hasn't either, and it's already not working for about x% of the population. 
GM just stripped all it's workers from healthcare for going on strike, and the government does nothing.. you want corporations to have this type of power over people, where policy is implemented in favor of the highest bidder?

Ofc the stock market isn't..

Be prepared to hold until retirement, not sure how old you are.
