GreenAddress supports segwit. 
I like Bread also, but no segwit support yet.

PerfectPrivacy is a bit more expensive, but exceeds PIAs security. 
ProtonVPN is a viable alternative, and comes “free” if go go with a visionary plan for email.

Mining with Nicehash is very profitable, and all fees can be avoided because they have some integration with coinbase. 
So nicehash miners get paid directly to an internal nicehash wallet -&gt;Free withdraw to coinbase wallet-&gt;free transfer to gdax-&gt;free transfer to external wallet.

You restore from the seed words that you get when you first set up your wallet.  You write those down and put them somewhere safe.

Mining bitcoin is not possible, but mining other crypto currencies are viable with a decent Graphics card. 
Check out and check the stickies for some walkthroughs. 
You can auto convert your mined alt-coins into bitcoin if you want.

I'm looking for a bitcoin friendly inexpensive/free merchant service that will allow me to build a small web based store-front.  I sell a few custom items/services, and have very low traffic.
I'm currently using squareup.com, and they only charge 2.75% per transaction.
Anyone have a recommendation?

When I was interested in trying out bitcoin, I just went to coinbase.com and set up an account.  I then linked a seldom used savings account that I hold at a bank with coinbase, and have been using that account to buy bitcoin.
it takes a while for the transactions to process (because I have not linked a credit card) but it allows you to get started!
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:10:25
bitpay sounds good, but since I only to one or two transactions a month, seems too expensive.
I didnt see any way to set up an online market on coinbase.  Did I just miss it?

There is zero hassle to move it to breadwallet. Also, it's $500 now. When it reaches Mcafee levels, he'll be sorry if it's still sitting in Coinbase.

Do you control the keys with GBTC?  OP does.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:54:36
If you happen to have a nice graphics card in a gaming machine, you could download nicehash and see how much it predicts your daily payout would be. 
This isn’t really mining bitcoin, but you get paid in bitcoin, so if that’s tour goal (acquire bitcoin) you can try it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:19:45
Coinbase has auto-buys on any schedule you like.  They charge 1.5% on purchase, and if you use GDAX to withdraw to your hardware wallet, you don't need to pay any fees to transfer out.  I'm not sure who else may do this, but I've done it in the past with coinbase.
I've only used a Trezor, and it does not come with firmware loaded, so the first time you plug it in, it downloads firmware.  It also has tamper-evident packaging.

There you go!  If you can afford another gpu, add it in.  
The btc will most likely rise in value, so if you hodl you could have decent gains.

What is the drawback to using something like breadwallet on my phone?
The convenience factor is nice since I have it with me at all times. 
Right now I just have a small amount in bread and cold storage is paper wallets.

I picked it up today.  Seems fun!  Not many folks online, but the one or two I ran into were helpful!  =)

The problem is trust. If you mint these, you will know the private key. 
Why would I buy it from you knowing you could take the Bitcoin at any time?
Has also been done. See here:

* Download breadwallet on your phone immediately.
* write down the random words this gives you, and keep them somewhere safe (this is like the keys to the bank, don't let anyone see them or access them!  Storing them on your phone with a screenshot, or on your computer in a document increases your risk.
* Transfer all your coin from Coinbase to that new wallet.
* Research Hardware wallets like Ledger or Trezor, or how to create an offline paper wallet.
Here is a good place to start:

Breadwallet on a mobile device is sound. They just published a blog post about the upcoming possible fork, and how your coin is safe there.

The simple "merchant" interface on Square is pretty professional looking.  It offers order tracking and email receipts.  Is there anything like this for bitcoin?  It would be hard to switch without it.

I'd love to try drive and jump!
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:27:03
I like this idea!  I suppose there is a bit of risk not being able to wait for transfer confirmation.
@_date: 2013-12-03 16:39:35
He can probably cite nothing.  This was most likely a knee-jerk reaction.
The good news is, after reading my reply, he asked how he can learn more, and he's on the way to creating his first wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:05:46
Yep!  So far very friendly, just a delay had me concerned.  Yanni responded to my email, and all is well!

Loose can also be a verb!   Maybe he loosed his hardware wallet into the wild.  Now it is off frolicking with the other hardware wallets that were lost.

I need to learn about this!  Seems like a good way to get people learning more about bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:55:09
I'm working with my family also!  The first thing that one person did was email me a pic they took with their phone of his private key.  0.o
I explained that he just put his most secure password on a postcard and mailed it across the world.
Back to the drawing board!   ;)

Thanks!  I'll give it a try tonight!

I had to look that one up.  ;)
I agree with your second paragraph.  Most of that probably flashed through his mind when he was reading the letter.  The good news is he is willing to learn more about it!

I used SnapCard on blackfriday.  They allow you to make purchases on Amazon, ebay, etc.    Extremely easy to use.  It was so easy, it actually made me a bit uncomfortable!  
I think they were overwhelmed with orders, and had a bit of delay replying to my customer support request, but have since responded, and seem like an easy way to shop with bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-04 23:52:41
If you could pay rent, buy food, pay utilities directly with bitcoin, this is a great move.  This early in the game, its too difficult to use bitcoin to pay for necessities.  If I was given the choice to get my salary direct in bitcoin, I might have to decline (as much as I love bitcoin.)  I would have to have a big stash of fiat just in case I ever had problems converting in a timely fashion to pay my bills.
It would be a fun experiment to live for a few months on nothing but bitcoin to see what kind of challenges one would face.
