No, there are definitely better options out there. I have heard good things about Bread Wallet, I haven't used it though so please DYOR as well

This discussion yesterday was hilarious. Shout out to everyone who was in here helping the noobs stay steady, my phone was blowing up with them thinking it was the end.

@_date: 2018-01-13 22:07:43
Excellent idea, this would be huge in Canada

when is this supposed to happen?
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:25:49
Haha the comments are hilarious, if each of those people had spent 10$ to learn about it'd they'd be able to go on an awesome vacation.. instead they are likely writing a similar comment on a different video in the same place as 6 years ago...

Makes sense! I am near Toronto and have some ties here for now, never hurts to be open to new ideas though! No coding experience but love sales and marketing. Im thinking I will learn asap just to fully understand every aspect of the concept as a whole. Thanks for the reply!

Id personally love to see him reveal himself in 2021, after bitcoin breaks $100,000 a pop. Then, in a stunning move, he distributes all of the bitcoin he holds across the poorest 25% of the world, effectively bringing them all out of poverty. World changes significantly over night, Satoshi goes down in history as the man who erased poverty, for however long that would last..

Awesome, just finished getting my business diploma and have 1 co-op position left before graduation. Any suggestions of where to look for work in the crypto industry?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:26:08
Whos to say it isn't already fucked.

Solid, he would've enjoyed crypto kitties more thoroughly as a boss.

Thats awesome I'm glad you were able to convince him. I should have never mentioned alt coins, as soon as my father saw them he wanted nothing to do with it. Unfortunately I can't show him any serious movement as I am running with .05 BTC right now.. College gets more expensive every year...
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:31:08
Same here, although I never really clued in until 2011, at that point i was in college and fully invested in school and had no $ to put in. Unfortunate but you can't go back.

Awesome work. Whoever is holding this wallet is likely not happy, but we sure are.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:32:44
Haha it certainly will be worth less than crypto in the future as well 
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:27:29
This is great! Banks get worse every single day. If only that gamestop account allowed you to spend the money at some restaurants or something... 
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:13:14
interesting take.

This screams of fear on their part. They're just fine with you heading to the horserace track and letting you bet whatever you'd like though.

Did anyone else notice the reference to Lightning Network in the first mission of the new GTA:Online After Hours DLC? Rockstar writers love making crypto references lately. They should accept crypto for micro transactions.
