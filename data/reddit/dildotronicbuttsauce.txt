How much are you up?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:33:21
Yeah me too. Would be nice to be able make 100k just from dividends after selling btc I bought at $1.

Could have pulled the trigger earlier on some small buys no? Anyway, you're probably wiser than I was at that age.

Here's a new phrase you should learn: margin call.

Good luck.

You really think it will go below 5000?

Relax guys. As long as you are employed, you'll recover. Not to brag, but when I started paying more attention in the spring, I started buying. With such an obviously risky "investment" I started small. I've bought in lots, I think no more than $200 per lot. Mostly paid little attention. I bought the 20k -100k hype, so I wanted to accumulate at low prices. It went exponential(obviously unsustainable) so I sold it all around $6900. Missed the top by quite a bit. 700-800, more than 10%. But it went near vertical. NEVER GO ALL IN ON AN INVESTMENT, SPECULATIVE OR OTHERWISE THAT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EXPONENTIAL JUMP. Especially when there is far less liquidity than in the stock market. 
Why did I sell? I still like btc, but I thought I could take the money I had committed to btc, sell, then buy back for less. Same cost. So far it's working. Btw, I only had 0.346 btc at max. Buying back in small lots now. If it eventually goes to 100k, or higher, I'll have more without risking more. So I like btc, but I WANT it to go lower, so I can have more btc for same money. 
Many of the posts here make me cringe. Obviously made by people with no investing experience expecting to make way too much money too quickly. Understandable, as I've sucked as an investor and I'm probably 10 years older than most here, so my mistakes have been less excusable.
If you bought big for the first time at 7k+, and it droppinh to 5500 makes you have to change your life, or cancel vacation plans as I saw one poster suggest, I can't comprehend what you thought would happen. It would go to 50k in a year and you'd miss it? Anything that can make you rich quickly without work can wipe you out even quicker. Bears and bulls make money. Pigs get slaughtered.

te'm 35. The depressed posters who went big near the ATH sound like early 20's. No disrespect, but that's what it sounds like. I could have bought btc 5 years ago. Or AMZN. Or GOOGL. Or APPL. Or NFLX. Or FB. Didn't buy any of those even though I had the funds such that I could be a millionaire, or multimillionaire right now, if I had any forsight, even doing the small incremental lot method (dollar cost averaging). If you think something is a great long term buy. Buy a portion now. If it goes down, you aren't fully committed and you lost less. Better yet, you can now buy more with same money if you still believe in it. 
No one invests without learning lessons the hard way. 
If you're in your early 20's, you can afford a few big screwups.

Lol, still believe the Russian collusion hoax? Trump won fair and square, get over it.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:21:59
But you could not live on it for any significant amount of time without going broke. To me rich means never caring about money again. 400k might be 10% of that.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:14:32
Lying scumbag.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:58:04
Nope. I know of pizzagate, but never looked into it, so I claim total ignorance. There is no proof of collusion, except by dems with Russians and Obama illegally spying on Trump's campaign. 
Russia changed no votes, hacked nothing. It's all just the dems doing what they condemned Trump for, possibly not accepting the results of the election. They blasted him for saying he might not accept, then they went and actually did it. Typical leftist behavior, being guilty of what you accuse others of. 
Do you the the election of Trump was actually illegitimate?

400k isn't rich af. It's not even rich at all. It's a good start on a retirement fund.
