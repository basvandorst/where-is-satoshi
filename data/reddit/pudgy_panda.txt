For some reason Im having an issue downloading openbazaar 64bit on a win 7 system. Any common fixes for such a general issue?

There always seems to be a lot of subliminal messages of whats to come in the future with Hollywood movies. There are people who have looked into it more deeply so I wont give examples, a simple google search will show you the way, but I wonder if its a sign that Hollywood has been using bitcoin in its films more and more often for no apparent reason. I realize this is conspiracy level stuff but I find it interesting.

Paper wallets. Just make sure you make two copies, one for them, one for you, incase they lose it at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:40:44
Also, check out opendime, I just read about their product and it is more user friendly I believe. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:47:09
Yeah, you’ll need to send btc to each address generated for a paper wallet.  is a good site with info on how to make/use them.

I thought it was weird she said she liked that it was anonymous. Its like she was trying to trick him into agreeing that it is to make bitcoin look sketchy.

I saw this same joke about the Russian ruble. A child asked his father for 5 ruble to go to store for milk and vodka and the father said "20 ruble? What do you need 50 ruble for?"

You can't put cash in the bank without being suspect, you can't take cash out of the bank without being suspect. Wtf dude.

Couldn't the actual miners just switch to a pool mining the 1mb version if the pool theyre in switches to xt? Seems like a bad move by the pool to switch to xt or classic if they lose all the miners.
@_date: 2016-03-17 05:29:35
This is what i suspect, too. The same thing happened to LTC before the halving. It doubled in price and is now at a profitable level for miners to continue business as usual. BTC has reached the price at which it will remain profitable for miners to continue mining at 12.5 BTC per block. 
In the future there may be small speculative increases in price, but for the foreseeable future, BTC will only be worth what miners need it too be worth to make a profit. Maybe in another 4 years it will be back at nearly $1000. 
It is actually a reserve currency now that will increase every halving.

You don't understand how it works. That's the point I'm making. You can send a segwit tx now, you don't need fancy GUIs 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:23:35
You all are retarded. You cheered for segwit for years and now don't even know how the damn thing works. That's the definition of a sheep.

Why do people try to divorce Bitcoin from the blockchain when they go hand in hand. What use is the blockchain with out the Bitcoin token

Don't trusts prevent anyone from accessing them until certain criteria are met? How could anyone remember the private key to sign a tx?

It was also the involvement of Wikileaks

I’m not saying I believe he’s satoshi. I’m just saying come 2020 or whenever he supposedly gets access to his keys, then we’ll know for sure.

BTC appears in the beginning when she firsts looks at her balance. It says 4.14 BTC underneath the dollar amount.
Subliminal indeed

Sounds like white collar summer camp, not prison. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 04:44:30
Noob here. So miners can just purge transactions and all the btc will return to the original address? 
@_date: 2015-09-07 06:53:46
I think you miss the whole concept of digital currency and decentralized ledgers. LTBcoin was and is just a method of utilizing the blockchain

Because miners will secure the network out of the goodness of their hearts. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 17:08:49
About $30,000
*I think. Someone posted a list of transactions that started at 998. Could have been a lot more. Some say $330,000 or a quarter million

This is a good point. Consider how 'stable' BTC has been the past year. 200-300 is consolidating/accumulating

A couple of things.
"Bitcoin is useless with out electricity and the internet" 
-No shit Sherlock. If the apocalypse happens and we lose both of those, nobody is going to want gold or silver either. Likely, humankind will revert back to the barter system as we need things like food and water and shelter and tools (of which gold and silver provide 0). 
"What is really innovative about bitcoin is the 'le underlying technology of the blockchain'" 
-Holy shit, when will these people understand that a decentralized ledger means nothing without a token (btc) to transmit upon it and a large individual user base to protect against the centralization and tampering of the ledger itself?

Since when do we shame someone for having a different perspective? The grace of bitcoin is the ability to vote with your action and know that your vote counts. Roger believes he has a solution and he shouldn't be put down for advocating it. If it is compelling, then so be it. If not, then it isn't.
Not thinking what everyone else thinks is not malicious.

I meant how does ETC effect ETH? It doesn't right. People are just fudding coin base because they can and they don't like Brian
