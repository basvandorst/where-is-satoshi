for sure, homie - i really hate the stigma(s) that BTC/cryptocurrencies are indubitably yoked to...
  but why isn't this happening to PayPal?  how were NiceHash's servers/wallets/etc exploited?  why in the everloving fuck do you (OP) do you have to suffer because these smart idiots don't have their security game up?  i mean, 2FA is a tough cookie...
  it just stinks; but NiceHash is, and should be held to the same standard of PayPal, let alone an FDIC-backed institution.  it is a company/corporation/entity.  if/when they have any assets left, you are absolutely entitled to your loss--$3k is a lot of money...please don't roll over.  i'll do a little work; call my lawyer bud tomorrow if you wanna pursue it...but this shit is fishy, and the fuckers/owners shouldn't 'sit back' (very...very fucking comfortably) whilst you, and many like you have taken a substantial hit.  
  it reaks either way, but keep on keepin' on.  peace.

- i'd be following any 'crumbs' if possible, but also keep very detailed records (btc val. @ date/time/II) for tax purposes as mentioned)
  don't give a shit if this is unpopular opinion...or if i get drawn and quartered for this one:
  *but this 'hack' looks a lot like a 'tumble.'  &lt;-- another reason to keep your records, OP...if it comes to a CALS, that'll make your time worth it as well,* but either way be screenshotting/saving this stuff...it is deductible USA-wise.

the architecture hasn't changed nor will it ever, so there's essentially never been a 'flaw' per se.  but you're right about the 'investors' thing...now's not the time (as in; right now) to be "investing"
  i may have misinterpreted the last part of your statement so forgive me if need be--were you talking about the makeup of bitcoin or said foolish investors' methodologies?
