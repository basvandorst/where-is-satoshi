Downvoting because of your italian name. And because there’s no iOS version.
Just kidding, upvoting and I love pizza.

No shit! I gotta get one!

At least, those papers are there somewhere. You only need to find them, don’t you?

You can trust Amazon or even eBay, but be sure to initialize the wallet before using it.
If you find a "scratch" card, initialize it and report to the official website ;-)

Actually... people buy and rent homes with bitcoin. Just FYI.

Yes you can. You're referring to exactly what I was talking about: the "scratch" card. The important thing is to initialize the wallet BEFORE using it, and you'll be fine.

You are double saving your money, not buying cigarettes AND putting those $7 into btc. It’s a win-win-win.

How about spectrocoin?

That’s always been my fear. Things like this do happen. We can’t trust our wives, how can we trust exchanges? Upvoted. And good luck.
