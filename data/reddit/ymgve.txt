Looking at that address, the transaction sources are unrelated and don't rely on each other. There's no requirement that unrelated transactions have to happen in the order they are made.

For your second question - if I remember correctly, pools ask individual miners to find blocks with lower difficulty, so they should in theory "find" a block multiple times per hour which acts as validation that they actually did the work.

What was the fee you used when sending? If it was too low, it's possible that Bitcoin nodes simply refuse to propagate it on, and it never hit whatever block explorer website they link too.

Transactions are finished when they are included in a block. What you're saying makes no sense - if no new blocks are started, no new transactions are processed.

The block reward destination address is included in the block hash. Changing where the block reward goes also changes the hash, and then it's not a valid next block anymore.

Why would they? Rescuing (some) Mtgox customers would cost them millions, with no gain but slight positive PR.

Did Multibit change recently? Last version I tested it sent change back to one of your existing addresses, and didn't create a new one.

Real hitmen would only take a job from you if you are a friend of a friend or something like that. Taking jobs from people you don't know is a sure fire way of ending up in court.
Considering this, there is *no reason at all* why someone should actually go through with a job if someone "hired" you online. You already got their money (or at least half of it), they don't know who the fuck you are, and actually doing the job gives you nothing but more risk.

Are you talking about in the context of mining, or are you talking about when you use your computer for non-mining/non-gaming tasks? Because in the latter case, you are just wasting electricity if you run your GPU at 3D clock speeds.
@_date: 2012-09-08 17:38:33
Why don't you ask your power bill? Most GPUs work at much less than full power as long as you're just browsing the web etc, because it makes no sense to engage at full clock speeds when the power isn't needed.

Make up your mind, Richard. Are bitcoins overvalued, or are they [vastly undervalued like you claimed a few months ago?](

So how did they find that out? It's not like the exchanges give away information to anyone who asks.
@_date: 2013-05-10 00:40:50
After decoding the numbers there are two small tasks left (That, given the hints, were much easier than the numbers)
@_date: 2013-10-19 13:42:18
It seems to be using Mtgox prices at Bitstamp for some reason. Maybe some badly made arbitrage bot?

Actually, seems like the simple password was broken almost immediately, it just took some time to show up on blockchain.info.

Here's a quick walkthrough:
First, answer to the first clue is the word "Screen". This decrypts the cryptobin in the second clue (Note that capitalization matters).
In the cryptobin there's some weird code which claims to be a "MEGA CLUE". This hints that it's a link to a Mega file, like [this](
This gives you a zip file "openme.zip", which contains the files REadMe.txt and secret1.zip. The text file contains a line of digits plus dots, and this is where everyone got stuck. It's actually a list of tone frequencies, which you can get by splitting the numbers into lines with two decimals eack.
When you've found out the notes, you will see that they are A,G,E,D,C,A,B,B,A,G,E, with some of them tuned in sharp (Don't remember exactly which ones right now). The solution is the word "agedcabbage", with capitalized letters when the notes are sharp.
This opens secret1.zip, which again contains two files, key1.txt and wired.mp3. The text file contains the first part of the private key for the address. wired.mp3 is full of red herrings, what you are supposed to do is to look at it via a spectrogram, which will reveal the words "Black Silence" at the end [kinda like this](
This is the password for the second cryptobin, which when opened contains the text "The body is the key where the Key is over water." and a link to a new cryptobin.
The solution to this is the [Francis Scott Key Bridge]( which goes over the Potomac River, which means "Potomac River" is the last password. Using that gives you the second part of the private key, and you have now solved it.

Volume has nothing to do with it. When MtGox didn't have cash problems, the lesser exchanges were mostly one or two dollars away from the MtGox price.
If MtGox didn't have withdrawal problems, lots of people would do the MtGox-&gt;USD-&gt;Bitstamp-&gt;BTC-&gt;MtGox arbitrage cycle and the price would normalize between the exchanges. The price is higher on MtGox because the only surefire way of getting what you own out of them is through BTC, which increases the buying pressure.

A 25 percent chance of passing the captcha by random guessing? Spammers would rejoice.
@_date: 2013-08-12 09:59:07
So is this the number of attempts that gets only the username correct, or the number of attempts that gets both the username and password correct?
In the former case, who cares unless your password is something like hunter2.
In the latter case, *where the fuck did they get your password from*, you should probably check your shit for malware and/or stop using the same password everywhere.

On Bitstamp there is a small lag in the matching engine so you can some times see the orders in the book before they get matched.

If you really think BTC will rise to 500-1000 USD again, it is better to buy them directly now instead of going the roundabout way with mining. You get more BTC per USD that way.

What about the *other* hit, on an ex-employee because he was caught by the cops?

I think it was just a normal thief. The Avalon ASIC looks pretty much like a beefed up standard PC, so that's what he took.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:21:19
Well I figured out the numbers (I think), but not sure what to do with the result. No variants on capitalization allows me to use it on either the cryptobin or as the zip password.
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:43:10
Interesting that the addresses were emptied almost the very second they were funded.
I just did a few brain wallet tests a few hours ago - one with a 6-char upper/lower/digit password, and one with a stupidly simple password that will be in the top 100 of any password lists.
So far both wallets still haven't been touched.
So either the people doing this only go for the larger amounts, or they don't do it 100% of the time.
@_date: 2013-05-09 23:46:50
Are the numbers supposed to give us two words, one with 4 characters and one with 7 characters, or is this just a giant coincidence?

It's normal behavior for some clients to send the change back to an existing address instead of creating a new address for the change. I know at least Multibit and blockchain.info does this.
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:21:07
When running a service that sends Bitcoins (like SR did when someone initiated a withdrawal), you need access to the unencrypted private keys in your hot wallet. There's no way to avoid this problem.
