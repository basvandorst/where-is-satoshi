'You will be fine' is not an estimate.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:28:33
The exact price depends on current fees, but yes.

How can you be an Ethereum bagholder right now anyway? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:28:06
USD Tether. It's supposed to habe the same value as USD, but is not actually real dollars. Bittrex issues them if I remember correctly.

Do Coinbase have any Ethereum projects?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:59:04


What? Not sure what you mean by that.


And if you asked Bitcoin Cash's communities, do you think they would want to name it BCash? I probably don't need to remind you that is not one of Bitcoin Cash's comunities.

No one can exploit your wallet with the receiving address. Some wallets create new addresses, some don't. You can use the same as many times as you'd like.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:30:55
You're probably right.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:00:18
So it's being used how it was intended.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:43:22
Hah :p
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:22:22
Well that changes *everything* /s

They're still driving a larger truck though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:15:54
You did a good job randomly insulting someone, but not so much in justifying the fees we have to deal with.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:19:35
Oh, I thought you were being sarcastic, sorry.

We’ve already corrected to 14k-15k though, but even if we pump further, which is a real possibility, we could drop 80% in the future still. An 80% retrace would be the result of a long term bear market, not daily or weekly fluctuations.

To stop thinking in fiat is almost impossible at this point, because at the end of the day, fiat is still king. For the vast majority of people Bitcoin is only the means to an end (getting more fiat). That could change in the future of course, but probably not for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:55:38
Everything is possible, but no one can really tell the future, so the best we can do is guess.

Oh, cool. It'll be interesting to see how their dapp browser works out. Do you know what the erc20 tokens will be for?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:22:50
Technology is not that much different to what it was in 2013-2015. Lokk at what happened after that pump. Doesn’t mean it’ll happen again, but I personally don’t know what makes this time so different that it’s not a real possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:14:28
It's a lot cheaper and a lot faster.

I know you said you wanted to. My point was that to stop thinking in fiat as things are now is nearly impossible when the whole proposition of Bitcoin for nearly everyone is its future value in fiat. That's the main reason people buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:24:54
Who else would decide the name then?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:10:30
Binance is USDT, so you can't pay with real dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:50:44
There are cryptos, or at least one, with more transactions, lower fees, and less wait time than BTC though. BTC is not at the top of the chain when it comes to utility. 
At the end of the day, all blockchains, as far as I know, still needs to scale (or at least needs a lot of work), so Bitcoin and everyone else still has time to fix their own problems, but at some point, blockchains will start to truly become useful (I hope), and if Bitcoin is not one of them, then that could be fatal.

A fork doesn’t happen by itself, so «official source» obviously means those who made the fork happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:09:11
I'm pretty sure Coinbase is not average. Coinbase is Gdax price.

How are people in Afghanistan today able to circumvent fees?

Ah, thanks for the answer! Say I bought stored some coins on a phone. If I lost it, or the phone itself stopped working, my coins would be lost, right? Am I understanding it correct that you would ideally store your coins on several different devices all at different locations (preferably devices you don't use)?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:50:59
What are some good options?
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:24:49
I see people mentioning losing their bitcoins because of sites being closed down. I have nearly no knowledge about bitcoins, but is it as risky as it sounds? Are all of your bitcoins, worth thousands and potentially millions, really in the hands of a platform/site ran by people you have no knowledge of?
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:11:40
Thanks for the link! I see Blockchain for Android is not listed there. Is there a good reason for that? Do you not have private keys on Blockchain?
@_date: 2017-01-04 08:17:52
Why do people want to see the price go down? Because they want to buy or they are invested in the competition? I'm assuming people wanting to see the price go down is a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:51:38
Why do they try to push the price down? So they can buy even more for a lesser price? Also, how do we know people are doing this?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:20:16
So everyone that has a regular Apple device then.
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:27:58
Well, how were things a year ago, and a year before that? And then a year before that even?
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:01:42
I'd say a decade or so at least. Everything will more or less be the same in a year.
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:47:52
When's the next update coming?
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:49:37
I'm not skeptical to Bitcoins potential, but I'm skeptical to the developers ability or want to innovate quickly and well enough. I'm more confident in the Ethereum developers, but I'm not convinced about its utility as a public chain yet. I'm not overly confident about any one coin really, so I'm currently holding 15 or so different ones.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:15:54
I'm curious how you are able to ytravel if you didn't sell?
