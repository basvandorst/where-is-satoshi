Regardless of the release date this segwit "rebirth" has nothing to do with the original segwit and is basically shit, not sure what hype is all about
have anyone actually researched and compared?

So, as you might know there was that New York agreement that planned to implement the original segwit back in November in order to deal with BTCs problems such as scaling (not enough transactions per sec), yet the mining community was divided on how to solve those problems: some advocated for segregated signatures, some proposed simply increasing size of each block, then they came together and decided to do both, and long story short - it didn't go through so after hitting 2k per segwit it dropped down to 0, after Jeff (founder) officially cancelled it.
So this fork hasnt come out, however we received the announcement recently that segwit2x is back in action. Well, look at what they plan to do for yourself so I don't misinform you here, and compare it to what original segwit had promised. Literally everything is different, starting with a completely different team behind it, ending with their tools.
