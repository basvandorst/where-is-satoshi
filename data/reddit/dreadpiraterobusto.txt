So when you slap yourself for not hodling it actually hurts.

I thought it was interesting to see how each central bank is approaching things differently.
Gave me a good view of the potential landscape.

Only by people who have a poor understanding of wealth.
Warren Buffet hates having excess cash and you should too. Cash is designed to be a depreciating asset on purpose. That's what the target inflation rate is. 
While you may measure your net worth in fiat but you should try to have very little of it in your portfolio. Stocks, bonds, real-estate, gold. These things are not "fiat".

Your gf has told other people bro. You can count on that. Also I'm willing to bet there'll be a day you wish she knew nothing about it. Hope I'm wrong.

Since cash moved from gold standard to fiat it has been, by design, a depreciating asset(AKA liability).

How does it get valued for people who don't currently use USD?

The question was what people outside of the US would call "Rhetorical". 
The purpose of which was to prompt you to think and consider your own answer. 
Q."How the fuck do Un-murican's  buy shit?" 
A. They must have something other than greenbacks. Holy shit, who knew?

This site helps 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:11:17
Indeed that's how the original post read like however it was obvious that the person you replied to had said "IN 2018".
Which is possible if the level of adoption goes along with it.

You would be surprised where your pictures are stored without your knowledge. Cache etc. Don't do this.

I don't disagree with you. But your focus is simply on the consequences of unsophisticated investors engaging in speculation. 
I'm taking about those with a vested interest in controlling monetary policy seeing crypto currency as a problem for them.
Consider, if you will, the differing attitudes toward cryptos from various world banks. Some are cracking down hard on it because it disrupts their power structure and control of capital. Others are racing to get ahead of it.
You're right. The wealthy don't own cash, they own assets and will always be rich. However moving the control of currency away from their central banks is definitely something they either try to dismiss as nonsense or feel threatened by. 
Crypto currency may very well be the start of a global power shift, perhaps no less revolutionary than the internet or the printing press.

Bitbuy.ca not the scam site bitbuy.in.
I've not used it. Not a recommendation. I just wanted to help some future person avoid the nasty.

Basic income. How is that supposed to help anyone?
It's utterly pointless making Rock bottom no longer be $0.00.
It's like Fahrenheit vs Celsius. Just two scales for the same measurement.

The very ones who have the most to lose with the rise of cryptos are the same ones who literally own the media.
This should not surprise anyone.

The FUD is strong with this one.
