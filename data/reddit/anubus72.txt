it did go from 11k to 9k, it just went back up within a day or so

just so i understand, you wait for it to dip below the price you bought at? what if that doesn’t happen?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:37:57
it’s still kinda a thing on the local level though

but it is safe to keep them on your own hardware which could be destroyed or stolen? nothing is safe by that logic

honest question, why is this considered safer than using an exchange? Yes an exchange can get hacked or some other disastrous thing can happen, but you can also lose your wallet, it can get stolen, some disaster can happen to you, etc. Is one guaranteed to be safer than the other? Seems like accepted wisdom that your own wallet is safer but I'm not that convinced

don't you assume that bittrex's forecasts are based on the same information? Except that you don't need to interpret the data yourself and potentially make a mistake

that doesn't sound simple at all. Background checks and selling insurance, all made by one programmer?
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:19:55
i think you overestimate the competence of a half competent programmer

that doesn't really answer the question of where the money for the house came from

how did you buy your bitcoin? i assume using fiat currency?
