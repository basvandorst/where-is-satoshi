Please please please do this and make a thread.  I'll have my popcorn buttered and salted.

Deal with it.

Great idea.
Definitely going to set up something like this.

Right on.  I think the delays may be caused by people trying to close their accounts - I've heard horror stories on but if it only took an hour for you that gives me some hope.

Nope, I need to train myself to not see is as USAF.

Buy a Ledger.  I wouldn't trust using CB as a holding account.

I got into cryptocurrencies May 5th.  This year.  I'm currently kicking myself for not giving it any thought any sooner, especially considering the gains since last year, ETH hitting moon levels and LTC being LTC.
FWIW I'm basically keeping my spending/bill paying money in fiat, and dumping the rest in crypto now.  I dunno how smart it is, but.. MOON!

Thanks.  Once my Ledger Nano S comes in I will be transferring all my coins from Coinbase to that.. *hopefully*.  I've been hearing it could take weeks, so I might get boned.

This I don't necessarily agree with.  Not all of gov't is filled with idiots - I'm sure they already have people working on understanding the entire mechanics behind the blockchain.
Remember in Mr. Robot when E-Corp creates E-Coin?

A very important lesson to us all, I think.

My God that's frightening.
