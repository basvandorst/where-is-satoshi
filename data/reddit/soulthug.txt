Name ONE THING that doesn't get deprecated and worth bitcoin. 


Paying ransoms or buying drugs or gambling doesn't devalues bitcoin. Paying camgirls does that.
Paying all above in FIAT doesn't devalues FIAT ?
What is bitcoin more than a currency ? The more is used the more successful is ?

You have a big issue, a really big one. Since when camming is prostitution?


Those camgirls are marketeers not prostitute, they are just selling images not sexual relations.
And FYI camming is an industry. A really big one. Take your brain out of the box and look around. You would be surprised on how many new things you will discover.

I witnessed that and here's the proof [8.888](

they really had a genius idea and time to make it available to public. I've seen one of [RoyalTiffany's]( shows and participated on some really good discussions on her channel there. 
And yeah, you should give it a try to trading [RoyalTiffany](

Seeing you repeating the same stupid affirmation twice tells me that you never crossed path with programming and **you are not higly technical**:




Anyone can see on first view that the only flash element on the site is the player (and that only when you use flash player because the site has the HTML5 player option).
About the color there are a lot of sites that use offputting colors and never seen someone complaining about that. Is bright red a better color that doesn't burn your eyes ?


As far as I have seen all the streams are NSFW. A bitcoin podcast can turn NSFW as long as it present nudity or offensive language. 
I respect anyone's opinion about anything but seeing stupidity trying to pass as smartness makes me think twice about one's opinion.
Edit: 


Is "nginx" better to spell and remember? (just an example, I can come with many of these)

Yeah, you missed the essential but what can I say. De gustibus non est disputandum.

I don`t know what you mean by "lifetime watching" but "Disclaimer: Streamium is in beta and there are known security issues. You may lose money, use at your own risk.[...]Streamium does not offer anonymity nor privacy from law enforcement nor malicious actors."
Unless the privacy and anonymity is provided it's useless for me as a bitcoiner.

Just because you don't do it that doesn't mean that ALL the people are acting the same. Actually some girls do earn more than you or anyone else is doing from trading or mining. See the reply of the_Lagsy above.

You can find this girl live on [XOtika]( and ask her anything you might need to know to satisfy your curiosity on how a girl ended to promote bitcoin and got involved that much into bitcoin. Also you can read this article/interview on [coinlife](

You should check out [NSFW - XOtika.tv]( too see some real bitcoin tipping action. Haven't seen anything like it yet and already made me spend some bitcoins.
