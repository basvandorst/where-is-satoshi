The design is for all people, but you don't think there should be any consequence in doing so, which is impossible. Who managed the infrastructure it takes to bank, before blockchain? The banks. Who manages it now? You. That isn't about "privilege", that's the change, plain and simple.
So now we have gone from "blockchain is the greatest idea ever, it puts people's money back into their own hands, and so many other things!" to "Only the privileged can enjoy it, unfair!"... pick one.

100 MB blocks shouldn't even be an issue, if you plan correctly.

Divide the core size into your bandwidth, add 15% more time, and understand how long it will take to download, ahead of whatever arbitrary scheduling you decide to create for yourself.

I would counter that your failure to plan is not the fault of the technology, or anyone else using it. You have challenges in rural BFE? That's not unique to Bitcion Core, that means you have challenges with anything at (extremely small) scale.
Looks like you found some solutions, good for you!

Lol, I don't hold anything except for BTC. This isn't about emotion for me, just you. I look at it from a logical perspective: this is exactly like ipv4 vs ipv6, we will find an end, let's get it fixed now, or you'll really be upset about the inconvenience it will cause for rural areas.

I really don't think that I've missed the point at all. 
Now you're segueing from bandwidth, to disk space, which are two separate issues. 
I'll say it again, if you don't plan this stuff, you're going to have problems. If you plan it with realistic expectations, you'll be fine. The disproportionate disadvantages you speak of are not the technology. It's the conditions at which people live. They've* found a way to accept cash, and debit cards, and credit cards-- they can find a way to get a 1TB hard drive, and write the blockchain to it. That's a HELL of a lot easier than managing merchant services, or managing cash, and it's also cheaper.
