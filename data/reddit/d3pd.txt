There are individuals that have *enormous* resources. They absolutely have the resources to sustain transaction volumes that could cripple Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. I call any transactions like this that are designed to damage the currency spam transactions.

Is it open source tho? If it is closed source then it cannot be considered secure.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:16:49


I would view that as a claim, a hypothesis. Weak evidence might be that you have a long history of writing in the style of Satoshi or that you had the necessary programming and cryptographic knowledge to write Bitcoin way back when. Strong evidence would be signing some data that hasn't been signed before using a Satoshi key. Even stronger evidence would be signing some data defined by me using a Satoshi key. It's not "proof" if this last thing is done, because the possibility would remain that you managed to acquire the key by hacking, for example.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:09:17
The reason the blocksize limit was brought down to 1 MB was to avoid saving spam transactions. Till we have Schnorr and LN Bitcoin remains vulnerable to spam attacks. Bitcoin Cash remains vulnerable and has no plans to defend against this attack, and it isn't experiencing the attack because so few people use it.

Fidor UK, a crypto-friendly bank
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:14:03
Fidor UK is indirectly connected to the Faster Payments System. The bank cartel running the FPS makes it very, very difficult for any bank that isn't one of the big four to access it directly, so Fidor has to do things a bit manually, meaning that its FPS transfers end up taking up to like 2 hours to complete (and that's during business hours).
So, to be accurate, Fidor *is* on the FPS, it's just that it is not-quite-so-faster payments. ;)

If it turns out that Ethereum really has an environmentally-friendly way to ensure decentralised digital scarcity, I'm in doubt about the ethics of running Bitcoin as it is with its current mining infrastructure. Ethereum is arguably more decentralised than Bitcoin too at this point.
And I'm saying this as a Bitcoin holder and miner.

Liked hearing your thoughts there. I'm of the view that Bitcoin is far more environmentally-friendly than the existing banking system (which runs servers, employs people, mints coins, prints notes and needs all sorts of machines built to read coins, notes and cards). However, it's looking like Ethereum has some plausible routes forward that are way more environmentally sound. If that's the case, then I think Bitcoin either needs to change in this way or people should change to Ether. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:31:31

That's the right attitude, but they could easily lock up your funds while closing your account. The real goal is to get away from entities that can prevent you from controlling your own money and a way to do that is to buy Bitcoins, Ethereum or whatever and then just not look back. Actually just use the cryptocurrencies in daily life and never again permit anyone to show you an "AUTHORIZED" notification when you are paying for something.

Why did you call the video evidence?
If you want to be technical, I want to see good evidence of a mathematical operation, the signing of some new, public data using a private Satoshi key. A simple blog post with some current newspaper headline hashed using the key would suffice.
A video requesting that I trust the guy or the journalist isn't evidence. "Signing" some already-signed data isn't evidence. Everything I have seen of this guy is precisely what I would expect a scam to look like.

Here's to hoping, but again this is a dubious claim.


Bitcoin is small in environmental impact compared to the internet, the grid, the banking systems and so on,  so, sure, this argument can be FUD, but it may well be true that Ethereum gets to be way more efficient while still protecting digital scarcity. That makes it possibly more ethical I think. Also, it is plausible that Ethereum is more decentralised than Bitcoin:

Nah, 2008. Read the original paper. It has large parts concerned with making it as easy as possible to have a majority of *honest* nodes and it does make estimates of how easy to store the blockchain it'll be with advancements in storage technology. It's super important to try to future-proof this stuff.


It's not a fair comparison because no other cryptocurrency has anything like the volume and velocity that Bitcoin has. To run into scaling problems, you have to have scale. Happily we have good solutions about to be widely available, with Schnorr and Lightning Network.


Well, that was accurate till a few months ago. Also, it isn't Satoshi's website. He registered it originally and then gave control of it away.

I'm a scientist. "Proof" is a word that isn't used in science really.
And no, a video by an uneducated journalist interviewing someone who claims to be signing some data that has already been signed publicly isn't evidence. It would be extremely simple to take some current, publicly-available data (say, a headline or a photograph from a recent newspaper) and to sign it using a Satoshi key and to publish that signature for anyone to verify. He has not done this.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:40:56


I get what you're saying, but Ethereum is open source too. It would be straightforward to create a branch of it and people would have the option of using the branch if they think it is technically better or more in line with their sense of ethics.


I wonder. I feel that there was a contract set 9 years ago with Bitcoin and it's very hard to change that contract, even in terms of changing the proof-of-work approach. Absolutely Bitcoin can do lots more but I'm not sure if it can really take steps to decentralise itself out of the mining farms and into more environmentally-friendly hardware.


Dude I'm with you. I'm happily mining Bitcoin, holding Bitcoin, mining Ethereum, holding Ethereum, but if we really can have the best of what Bitcoin has in terms of decentralisation and security of digital scarcity in a much more energy-efficient way, isn't that a better version of the Dream?


Yup, I've heard of this type of approach, effectively using seven-degrees-of-separation to solve Sybil attacks. I think it's cool. It kinda happened in Ireland in the 70s already. Here's a quote from Rutger Bregman's *Utopia for Realists*:

@_date: 2018-01-03 15:17:40
It's not normal, no. The reason why it happened is because Bitcoin was under spam attack right when you sent it and basically the minimum needed to get a transaction through at that time was 100 sat/byte.
The mempool is pretty ok right now, so you may want to give it another day or so and rebroadcast the transaction, but if it doesn't clear by then you may just need to bump the fee to something over 100 sat/byte.
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:26:23

Bitcoin Cash does not have defences against blockchain spam attacks, the ASICBoost attack, is already susceptible to the 51 % attack, and is being lead by a bunch of creeps: 
It is already way too centralised (because it is very difficult for anyone but wealthy organisations to run nodes for it) and has had dodgy bugs like its emergency difficulty adjustment algorithm going completely nuts.
Bitcoin has SegWit which de-facto enables more information to be stored in a block and SegWit enables the Lightning Network, which has been well-validated and has been running for months on Litecoin and is running well on the Bitcoin testnet. The Lightning Network basically allows you to get the hash of a whole bunch of transactions and store that in the blockchain instead of having to store a hash for every single transaction. It's also superfast and cheap -- certainly way faster and cheaper than Bitcoin Cash -- and prevents the ASICBoost attack.
So, in a nutshell, Bitcoin protects you more, particularly by defending the most important aspect of Bitcoin: decentralisation. Bitcoin Cash was started by some powerful miners to continue be able to make more money using the ASICBoost attack and they come out with a whole lotta junk reasons for it that don't really stand up to scrutiny.
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:51:37


Well, most of my transactions are sent at a cost of around one or two Euro, but they do take a few hours then to confirm. So, yes, I am concerned at the fees required for fast confirmation (another way of saying it is that I want Bitcoin to scale well) but I have seen the Lightning Network in action and it seems to be a very decent solution. For something like Bitcoin Cash, it's important to remember that the value of a coin unit is much less than that of Bitcoin, so while their fees can seem lower, proportionally they aren't all that impressive.


It can help to bear in mind that the fee for a Bitcoin transaction is paying for a lot more than the fee for, say, a VISA transaction (which is usually paid for by shops rather than customers). A Bitcoin transaction isn't just a payment; it is a little piece of information stored on the most reliable record ever created in human history. It is a digital signature of not just financial information but *any* information. That's why it is used for notarisations, for example, where you can confirm that you took a photograph or wrote something and did so at before a specific time. You also get that information stored on millions of computers in perpetuity. In that context the fees don't seem so crazy to me.
But still, let's not just make it awesome and decentralised and secure, but also super cheap and super fast. The best option we have right now for this is the Lightning Network and that's on the brink of being switched on. :)

The main mining pool for Bitcoin Cash is the one controlled by Roger Ver of Bitcoin.com. You can see the breakdown here: 
Ver has many vested interests in seeing Bitcoin Cash succeed so is mining it at a loss.
Remember that there actually isn't much interest in mining Bitcoin Cash ideologically at all and, of course, it is more profitable to mine Bitcoin, so most miners do that.
It's worth comparing the distribution of Bitcoin miners to that of Bitcoin Cash (linked above):  In short, Bitcoin Cash is dangerously centralised.

Very good point. For Venezuela, even with high fees (or, conversely, low fees for slow transactions), it absolutely makes sense to store savings in Bitcoin but for places like Kenya it is more of a problem. Like, it needs to be cheaper than M-Pesa basically.


Yes. I'm super keen to see it get started. It'll certainly be fast and cheap. Where we need to be careful is in decentralisation. Happily it is pretty easy to be careful about this, and even a relatively small number of nodes can result in very large numbers of possible connections. Right now, even in only this testing phase, there are over 800 channels, so we seem to be on the right track:

Because Bitcoin already had a large blocksize and it was attacked by spam transactions. It had to reduce the blocksize to defend against this attack. Bitcoin Cash remains open to such an attack. Lightning Network is an attempt to scale to a superfast, supercheap system wherein groups of transactions are saved under a single hash on the blockchain. It not only uses the blockchain more efficiently (rather than just blindly increasing blocksize) but also defends against spam attacks and makes transactions fast and cheap.

Just as an additional recommendation, it's super important to do your own research on this because there are so many liars and shills out there. You cannot simply trust people. A common lie by the Bitcoin Cash people is that Bitcoin is overly cautious by keeping its blocksize at ~1 MB, but they conveniently ignore the fact that the blocksize used to be much, much higher. A reduction in size was needed because it was found that people were able to attack the blockchain and spam it. Just blindly increasing blocksize as Bitcoin Cash did does not solve security problems.

We know that Apple, as well-intentioned as it might be, cannot expect its users to trust it because we know that the US government is regularly using gag orders to compel technology companies to lie to their users about backdoors. Would it not make perfect sense for Apple to open source its chips, hardware and software *completely* if it cared about its users' security?

macOS and iOS are *closed source* operating systems. macOS and iOS use open source components. Darwin is one component and it is mostly open source (but remember that it is open source in the sense of the APSL, which means that it can link to closed source code).


Apple uses open source cryptography software like OpenSSL and it has its own Security Transforms and Common Crypto. I do not know how genuinely open source these components are.


What? Every modern operating system is hardened.


Sorry, no. macOS and iOS are **closed source**. Darwin is effectively just the kernel. If you want to argue otherwise, then feel free to link me to the code of Quartz, Cocoa, the Apple BSD extensions, Finder, the user binaries, the applications etc.

Decentralization would mean that there isn't a small set of computers or people that a government or group of governments could get their hands on, as we saw with AlphaBay and Hansa recently. Onion network routing offers only so much protection and people require decentralization security when big money is involved. You need to be thinking in terms of [BitTorrent]( [OpenBazaar]( [ZeroNet]( and [The DAO](
It's a cool idea, btw, and the website looks good. You could try moving it to ZeroNet...

Your friend is likely better off just buying a large amount of Bitcoin and either using it or just waiting, if their goal is just to make profit. If they wanna make Bitcoin work better and to get a nice payback while doing so, then maybe mining is a nice thing to do -- get an Avalon 741 miner because that'll give lots of control.
The bandwidth used for mining is minimal, but the latency from a pool is important in order to avoid stale shares, so make sure a decent pool is nearby.

Yes, because it is a single, identified entity. Anyone else you are dealing with is anonymous and could themselves be state actors anyway.


Banks can absolutely reverse transactions, particularly if they involve stolen funds. For example, you could be selling Bitcoin to an anonymous person. This anonymous person sends you funds and you release the Bitcoin. A day later, your bank contacts you to tell you that the funds have been transferred back to their original owner whose account had been hacked. Your Bitcoins are now stolen.
From a legal perspective, you have no protections in this case because you were dealing with a criminal. It is almost like buying stolen goods, where, in this case, the goods are stolen fiat currency.


Identity theft is a major problem.

@_date: 2017-11-07 20:11:15


I see what you're saying. I'm not sure. I think that it depends on the cost of mining. The mining *difficulty* that provides us the proof-of-work integrity does not have to correspond to high electricity or hardware costs, at least in due course, with advancements in hardware and -- maybe -- changes to the POW algorithm. I suppose a kinda similar idea is how people are happy to store movies and so on in a decentralised way on the BitTorrent network. So long as the costs are small (for BitTorrent that is mostly storage space and bandwidth, as opposed to hardware and electricity for Bitcoin), people are happy to pay because they see the benefits, like being able to share a movie or other data easily in an uncensored way. I'm saying that Bitcoin could be seen in a similar way.


Oh wow, that's hilarious! It totally seems like a contradiction to me, but I'd love to hear how you end up mixing the ideas together.
For the DMT I get the inherent sense that there are hierarchies of intelligence or consciousness everywhere, whether that be in the emergent behaviour of a flock of birds, groups of cells forming organisms, or groups of people working together.

Sorry? Bitcoin is already useful to me. An SQL database would of course be way more efficient, but it misses the point of the blockchain. I like that for a tiny fee I can store a hash of any data I want on a massively distributed record. No one has to trust me. I find that useful. I already am willing to pay for this utility (in the form of a small fee for the transactions to store the hashes and in the form of expending effort on keeping the mining hardware up and running).


Em, to some extent. I mean more that mining rewards will drop a lot while hardware efficiency will go up. I see a sort of stead state emerging that makes mining neither a profit nor a loss. I guess we'll need it to be profitable for the time being. In due course, perhaps we'll see miners and nodes running everywhere efficiently. Imagine a miner in your wristwatch for example.


Hehe, I'm totally using my miners for heating right now. :) Sure, they're making only a little. I get a kick out of running them, though, and on voting on the future directions of Bitcoin via Slush Pool. I don't have to personally find blocks as part of a pool and I *do* have a small role in defining the Bitcoin blockchain by voting in a pool. I'm all for Core btw.


Haha, indeed it is very forward-thinking. Still, though, we are nowhere near the limits of physics. ASICs will continue to advance a great deal and we'll see massive advancements when quantum computers get their error rates down. It'd be great to see the Bitcoin network get more efficient and decentralised.

I'm more familiar with EU job markets than US, but you can make economic estimations based on scarcity, like this:
Many jobs that are not economic contributors (at least directly) can have huge value to society, and nursing is a good example of this.
In the UK, nursing absolutely is underpaid, and indeed salary has effectively been dropping over the last ten or so years in real terms: 


This seems like a terribly vague statement.


Do you mean that men tend to do more risky jobs? That is the case, yes.


It isn't just raising children that is undervalued, but it seems you get the point that economic contributions are not the only type of value for a job.


Why would we try to push people to do things they didn't want to do? It's far easier to talk about simply increasing the salaries of jobs that tend to have more women doing them, the rough goal being to ensure that women, on average, have a similar economic power to men.

Savings accounts are a scam. There are the obvious objections like the interest rate being massively less than the rate of inflation (which means saving in this way is a net loss). More than this, though, is that putting money in banks is a pretty big risk. Just look at how life savings were destroyed in 2008 USA. Look at how the Brexit vote devalued the Pound by more than 20 %. Storing value in banks is very risky and you should be paid waaaay more for accepting that risk.

I value someone who saves lives more than I value someone who places bets on Wall Street.

When you ask a question like "Why aren't they hiring women only if they are cheaper?" it shows me that you don't have a grasp of the economics of pay gaps. Women are not paid (much) less than men for the same work; no qualified economist says this.
The gender pay gap arises because the jobs that women tend to do tend to be paid way less than the jobs that men tend to do. In the US specifically, there are other factors like paid maternity leave being terrible that add to the gap too.


In the context of this thread, I'm saying that the fact that women have waaaay less economic power than men should hint at there being a systemic pay bias against jobs that women tend to do. Nursing and teaching are two professions that are illustrative of this. They do not provide high economic contributions (directly) so end up undervalued, in spite of the fact that they are incredibly important, even for developing an economy. Just look at the economies of countries with no schooling or no health systems. Undervaluing women is extremely shortsighted.


Are you trying to make the point that people who go through a longer education should be compensated for this? If that's your point, then sure. I don't know where you are, but in your particular example, nurses tend to receive about 4 years of medical training and then go through clinical accreditation, while your average bank branch manager might have a 3 year degree in something like accounting or business. Nursing takes more time and is more difficult. Obviously nurses also accept far creater risk (of being sued for causing harm etc.).
Again, I don't know where you are, but where I am university is free and postgraduate education is funded, so the need to "pay back" those who spent longer in education isn't really there.

Can you consider for a moment that you have actually been mislead? There was a time decades ago when women were paid less than men *for the same work*, but that isn't the case so much now.

Nope. Women have much less economic power than men do. The gap absolutely does exist.

Sure, the acceptance of changes to Bitcoin code is mostly decentralised (it could be much better though, with an alternative to miners voting, because it takes wealth to be a miner) but acceptance of a fork is dependent on people actually accepting the fork (probably the better option?).
The ideas are under development. The internal ideas for the currency (basic income, demurrage and perhaps a sort of decentralised control of weightings of each individual's coins) are perhaps the easier ideas; more of a challenge is making the ideas that encourage use of the currency (so perhaps paying people to convert to the currency and charging people to convert from the currency and then the more difficult task of convincing a large population to use a currency that serves most people rather than extremely wealthy people).

The idea is that people with larger hoards are encouraged to spend it more strongly than people with typical savings, and indeed people with larger debts see those debts decrease in value. So if you're not extremely wealthy, anti-hoarding measures are likely a good thing (in tandem with printing of money in an checked way that is controlled by the users, which Bitcoin largely addresses).
@_date: 2019-04-17 21:12:15
Inflation is often helpful to poor people tho. It helps to make hoarding a little less likely. Bitcoin doesn't have obvious protections against hoarding.

Yup, you can see that happening here with nurses: 


Is it reasonable to expect a UK nurse to leave the country just to get a fair wage?


Just for a moment, imagine saying that to a slave. If someone feels they are not being paid fairly there are two possibilities: either they are expecting to be paid more than their job is worth to society, or they are not being paid what their job is worth. UK nurses are underpaid because they are not direct economic contributors. That doesn't mean what they do isn't incredibly valuable. As was once said, GDP measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile.

Well Bitcoin code would be the place where that is defined, then the people could decide whether to accept the code or not. That is decentralised, not centralised.


Well in the case of Chiemgauer it is a cash note that isn't spent within three months.




These are concepts that would depend on the ideology supported by various groups of people. So I, for example, would oppose the notion of having to save for a pension or having to pay for education; something like basic income would be used instead. There are good arguments to prevent inheritance, such as the argument to try to improve equality of outcomes.


This depends on lots of things, like whether you implement local currencies or whether you end borders. I tend to prefer the latter because it opposes the idea of forcing people to sell their work for much less than it is worth.
@_date: 2019-04-23 11:37:03


Bitcoin can pretty much be divisible to any degree we like, so that comment doesn't make sense. Someone hoarding indefinitely would be equivalent to Bitcoins being lost and the value of all other Bitcoins would thus increase. But people hoard so that they can use that financial power at some point. An early example of that happening in Bitcoin is whales manipulating the market, which is not in the interests of poor people.


Consider that you think this because you live in a capitalist system.


Or using threats of various forms, buying laws, buying political power, buying land, buying information and surveillance capabilities. Indeed with sufficient financial power Bitcoin itself could be defrauded.
Bitcoin addresses some issues associated with unchecked printing of money. I don't see how it prevents wealthy people from controlling the ability for others to be wealthy; actually I would see it as entrenching financial elites.

Anyone can release a Linux kernel... ?
Obviously the "official" Linux kernel has hundreds of thousands of coders contributing and the eyes of all of the world's security researchers are able to see its code.
Windows is closed source so there are only a tiny number of security experts assessing it. That ain't secure. To have even a chance at security it must be open source.
@_date: 2018-03-25 15:18:34
I mean... just store your data encrypted on it, like in VeraCrypt.
@_date: 2018-03-13 11:41:46


Ok, now tell me about how long bugs in Windows exist before they are fixed. You cannot. You cannot because it is closed. At least with Linux we know that more eyes of security experts can look at the code and we have full transparency. With Windows we know nothing and are expected to trust a for-profit company that we know is compromised by the US spying regime.


Again, you have no information on Windows so cannot make this claim. We can qualify the security of Linux. With Windows we cannot (well until it is too late and we see the results of a hack or something).

@_date: 2018-03-25 22:38:22
Well, sure, but if you want to use computers today you end up having to compromise. TrueCrypt and its descendants are about as secure as we can get. They might have bugs but we have at least excluded a large number of ways in which they are insecure. *Everything* might have bugs.
So, TrueCrypt should not be the priority. A priority should be to stop people from using closed source software, like applications, Windows, MacOS etc. That at least protects people from mass data collection to some degree. Obviously there are still hardware backdoors, but spying regimes would find it hard to target all computers via IME backdoors and the like.
Other priorities are the security and privacy motivated moves to entirely open source computers. That means entirely open source chips, entirely open source microcode, entirely open source hardware, entirely open source operating systems and entirely open source applications, hopefully with all of them security audited. Open source chips (Intel-compatible CPUs etc.) are harder to achieve of course.

An issue is that while you could have a currency that issues to everyone a basic income of an ever-increasing amount, megarich people usually can discover ways to shield themselves from that type of inflation that disincentivises hoarding. In good cases, they invest their money. In bad cases, they store their money in the form of empty buildings. It's hard to see how a currency can solve this problem, unless the currency somehow has open source intelligence built into it for monetary policy.

TrueCrypt remains a very secure piece of software. It is entirely open source, so it does not matter what the motivations of the creators were when they quit. TrueCrypt went through a thorough security audit ([OCAP]( There are some shortcomings of TrueCrypt security on Windows, but no one uses Windows who is competent at security anyway.
TrueCrypt isn't supported, but VeraCrypt is, so the general recommendation is to use it instead for reasons of preparedness mostly. This is the view of [ANSSI]( anyway.

I do criticise the existing system.
However, right now, the Bitcoin economy is tiny in comparison to the existing economy. That means that it is way, way more at risk of manipulation.
I'll be more specific. The existing global market cap is around 80 trillion USD. Bill Gates has a net worth of 86 billion USD. If he were so inclined, he could have control of around 0.1 % of the world's economy. Now, the existing global market cap of Bitcoin is around 190 billion USD. That means that Bill Gates could have control of __about half__ of the entire Bitcoin market.
So, in the first case, the richest person in the world can, at absolute best, take control of about a tenth of a percent of the world's market. In the second case, he could take control of about half of the Bitcoin market. That is an absolutely enormous degree of economic control and it is a very great risk.

Why? Windows is backdoored spyware. TrueCrypt may run mostly well on Windows, but Windows is a compromised platform, so it doesn't really matter if TrueCrypt runs well on it.


Actually, there was the security audit of TrueCrypt. That is about as much as you can do to verify the software is free of defects. It goes without saying that *anything* could have bugs. To have even a chance at security, you need the software to be open source so that as many eyes of security experts can see the software. Windows is closed software so isn't secure. TrueCrypt (and VeraCrypt etc.) is fully open source and is security audited.

Bitcoin is awesome but it is simply true that it is too centralised by ASIC mining (and I say this as a Bitcoin miner myself). Centralisation compromises Bitcoin. I am very glad to see decent attempts like Ethereum trying to fight this type of centralisation. I don't know that they've got it right, but good on them for trying. Perhaps Bitcoin can draw in these ideas when they are validated, just as the Lightning Network is being drawn in from Litecoin.

To make changes to the Bitcoin ledger, you need a public and private key. We call the public key a Bitcoin "address". In order to be able to send Bitcoins from an address, the private key is needed.
You can generate a Bitcoin public and private key pair using a tool like [vanitygen]( The steps on Ubuntu Linux are something like the following:
    git clone 
    cd vanitygen
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
    sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev
    make
    ./vanitygen 1Super
Here, just for funsies, you're asking the software to generate a public address containing some fun bit of text (here "1Super"). You don't have to do this.
Alternatively, you can use some software called a wallet to generate public and private keys for you. Make sure that the wallet gives you the ability to back up the private key in some way. Also, to have a chance at security, it is best to use only wallet software that is open source. [Electrum]( and [Mycelium]( are decent wallets.
LocalBitcoins is a nice Bitcoin trading site with a clean history and decent security. If you sign up to it, you get a wallet assigned to you which can be used to receive and send Bitcoin. Note that you don't have the private key in this case. While LocalBitcoins has a good reputation, this gives you less control and security.
My recommendation is to generate a public and private key pair using vanitygen, store them very securely, and then to import the private key into a wallet like Electrum or Mycelium. You can give the public key to whoever is paying you.

It is trivial for someone powerful to purchase a vast amount of Bitcoin and to have control in that way.

Yes, and it works fine. I'm quite aware that it was specifically designed to be limited in scope.
I also want a decentralised system like Ethereum in existence that tests ways of decentralising Turing complete coding.


If there are better approaches to proof of work that are more efficient, that is a good thing. I'm glad that alternatives are being explored. There is a balance to be struck between network efficiency and decentralised trustability. Bitcoin network efficiency is great, but it is definitely under risk of centralisation because ASIC hardware is way out of reach of most people. Bitcoin should be for most people.


It also allows people to consider options like running mining on their phones. You should not be so quick to dismiss the dangers of centralisation.

We should verify as much of our security as possible. Writing some TOTP code in Python doesn't take much time, as you can see in [this]( comment. Writing an operating system is not a realistic expectation for someone. For something like that, an open source operating system that has as many security researcher eyes looking at it as possible is recommended. So, for example, something like seL4 would be ideal, but in practice Linux is pretty good. Then, following that, you keep good checks on hashes at all levels of the computer you are using, everything from programs to operating system to hardware to chips.
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:44:38
It was open source up till around 4 years ago when it went closed for no stated reason. To have even a chance at security, you must use things that are only open source. I advise you to assume that Google Authenticator is backdoored and that you should roll your own little 2FA equivalent in Python.

It's not necessarily a bad thing. Dictatorships like Russia that have endorsed Bitcoin are thinking very short-term, because ultimately crypto takes economic control away from dictators. Better governments could see that as a net good thing. Like, for example, the US recognises that Tor is a net good thing, in spite of the fact that it undermines some of its control.
Governments do also have lots of experience in economic management. So long as a proposed cryptocurrency is open source and part of a public blockchain, I think it is entirely appropriate for governments to contribute ideas to the development. One key idea I'd like to see more thinking on is inflation or other measures to try to reduce the power of the megarich and to reduce wealth inequality.

Anyway, in all of the unconditional universal basic income experiments (run everywhere from New Jersey to Pennsylvania to Iowa to North Carolina to Indiana to Seattle to Denver to Mincome in Manitoba, as well as some smaller ones in Africa) it increased health, increased education, boosted the economy, and literally ended poverty. Apart from new mothers, people didn't tend to work less when they received UUBI. In fact, particularly as seen in the African UUBI experiments, having a solid income enabled people to have more free time to educate themselves so that they could advance to a new form of work or to start businesses.
If even the like of Nixon and Rumsfeld were pretty much convinced by it, then I think that means it is compelling:

It is essential. Open source is the bare minimum to have a chance at security.


Cool, sorry I could have been more polite there.


The key point that you need to get is that you cannot be a critical component in the chain. The contract __cannot__ fail if you turn out to be a fraud or if you decide to censor it or if you get hacked or if a government decides to shut you down.
What I could imagine your website being is a way to document your approach to contracts, to provide or generate code for a contract, to provide torrent links to contract code and to provide a way to store hashes of data on chain. It could also be a way to show the status of a contract. It could also run the contract (as it does now) and could provide an API, but it is absolutely essential that a user is able to run the code of the contract themselves, so that if you or your infrastructure fails for any reason, the user can make the contract work.

As far as I can see, these are supportive of Bitcoin. Neither is damaging to the Bitcoin blockchain or how it is defined, and neither is fraud.
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:48:15
I suspect it is mostly a question of confidence. We know approximately how much it costs to mine a Bitcoin (let's say around 1000 USD for a big mining operation). We know how much value a network like VISA Credit or VISA Debit transfers each year. Like, in 2016 in the USA alone, VISA Credit was used for about 1.6 trillion USD in purchases and VISA Debit was used for about 2 trillion USD in purchases. So, that's about 3.6 trillion USD being used for purchases on VISA systems in the USA.
We know also about how many Bitcoin units are in use -- some fraction of about 16.7 million BTC. Let's say 10 million. Now, if Bitcoin takes up 1 % of what VISA is doing in the USA, that means that all Bitcoins in use (say 10 million) would have to be able to cover a value of at least 36 billion USD. That would require one Bitcoin unit to be the equivalent of about 36,000 USD.
So, that's 36,000 USD for one Bitcoin in the US alone if it takes up 1% of VISA. It doesn't even take into account the increasing scarcity of Bitcoin or other financial transactions or even the rest of the world.
Will Bitcoin be used for the equivalent of 1 % of VISA transactions or something similar? I don't know. It is a question of confidence. Everything else about scarcity we mostly know.

Google Authenticator was open source up till around 4 years ago when it went closed for no stated reason. To have even a chance at security, you must use things that are only open source. I advise you to assume that Google Authenticator is backdoored and that you should roll your own little 2FA equivalent in Python.
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:59:07
It went up after the last fork. Why would you figure it would go down? Surely people who get their free SegWit2X coins will sell them for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:18:51
If code is open source, then there is the possibility for more eyes of security experts to look at it if it is open. More importantly, *I* personally can look at the code to verify it. I should be able to know what is running on my computer.


Sure, but I didn't claim that open source is perfect, did I? I said that *to have even a chance at security* we need open source. If I cannot see the code, I will not judge that code to be secure.

Nah, unconditional universal basic income makes excellent sense and has worked wonderfully in all of the trials of it. That's for the general population.
It goes without saying that every US individual that derives from slaves is also due about 200,000 USD in compensation and damages.

I am advising that rather than trusting closed source software like Google Authenticator for 2-factor authentication (2FA) security purposes, one should write one's own code. You should read up on how to generate TOTP and  HOTP tokens. This can be done in a few lines of Python.
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:16:15




The whole point of this domain is that no one is forced to trust anyone else. You are forcing someone to trust you and your code and your server and that you won't suffer connection or server or legal problems. That is completely unacceptable.
Now, if you created a hash of your code and stored that on the blockchain and made the code available in a decentralised way, such as via BitTorrent, then maybe you'd have something.
I can't find your platform's code on GitHub and, as a more minor point, you appear to be using Python 2 ffs.


Solidity isn't some company expecting its users to trust it. Solidity is decentralised and run by everyone. You have some Python 2 code that is run only by you.

Running an Avalon 741 is profitable.
It should also be mentioned that it is entirely possible that mining at what is a slight loss today could well work out as being profitable in the future, as the mined Bitcoins become worth more and more over time.

... for 1/3 the upfront unit cost.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:27:45
I explicitly mentioned computational capability per unit power used. It's kinda a given that you pay for power, right? You calculate how much the power would cost you based on where you are. I don't want to assume too much (you made the assumption that dollars are the currency to be used when I am not in the US, for example).
@_date: 2017-07-24 15:49:57


Not really. I use checksums all the time.


No, trust isn't compatible with security. Verification is. Use open source automated systems for verification.


It is worse because with open source you have all of the eyes of the world's security researchers able to view the code. If it is just Apple, not only are you trusting a for-profit corporation, you are also trusting the US spying apparatus, which has a proven track record of forcing tech companies to lie to their users about backdoors.


Well, that is what you are told. It is entirely legal for the US government to require tech companies to lie about these things, and it has done so many times. You cannot simply trust Apple when it says that it has not been compromised, because it is likely that it is being compelled to say this.


Well, you shouldn't use a modern computer. A modern Linux is fine. All modern major chips have backdoors, the biggest example being the Intel Management Engine in all modern Intel CPUs.
I'm not saying that using open source operating systems is inherently secure, but it is certainly more secure than using closed source operating systems compromised by the US spying regime, the major examples being operating systems by Microsoft and Apple.

Even the name "Bitcoin Cash" is scammy. I cannot imagine anyone actually informed buying it.
Obviously I am making the assumption that anyone buying "Bitcoin Cash" doesn't know what they are doing and they are uninformed. Can we agree that it would be wrong to take advantage of someone like that?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:29:42
Do you have a reference for that S9 price?
It is listed as ~2100 USD here, for example: 
It is listed as ~2550 USD here, for example: 
2100 / 714 is about 3.
2550 / 714 is about 3.6.
So, the prices I'm seeing suggest that the S9 is like 3 to 4 times the cost of the Avalon 741.
@_date: 2017-07-26 13:46:37
Where can one easily sell Bitcoin-Cash?
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:53:33
Ok, then. There is the cost of the miner itself and there is the cost of running it. The S9 costs like 3 to 4 times what the Avalon 741 costs to buy and then also costs a good bit more to run, except it is a lot more efficient at computation per unit power.
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:21:35
You buy 100 bucks today. Tomorrow, let's say that the Bitcoin you bought is now worth 120 bucks! Cool, that means that you can now sell 20 bucks worth of the Bitcoin and then what you keep in Bitcoin is 100 bucks, what you originally invested. Congratulations, you've just made 20 bucks. :) Now, you can wait till tomorrow.
After 5 days (based on the increase in value in your assumption) you have 100 bucks back in your hand and 100 bucks worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-31 17:05:16


Of course it has nothing to do with efficiency! It is the cost of the piece of hardware.


There are many things to be compared when buying a miner. There is the upfront cost (in this case, the S9 is about three times the cost of the Avalon 741), the efficiency (i.e. the computational capability per unit power used) (in this case, the S9 is more efficient than the Avalon 741), the control you get over the machine (in this case, the Avalon 741 is mostly open and you can plug basically any computer, including a Raspberry Pi, into it to control it as you see fit) and the ethics of the company (for example, ASICBoost, an idea promoted by Bitmain, might be seen to be damaging to Bitcoin).
I prefer to deal with a more ethical company that gives me more control over the device I purchase.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:21:53
Apple operating systems are closed source too, so cannot be considered secure. To have a chance at security, use only open source operating systems.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:41:33
Mycelium gives you some control over the miner payback. The current options I see are as follows:
- low-priority: &gt; 98 sat/byte, ~3 hours
- economic: &gt; 120 sat/byte, ~2 hours
- normal: &gt;162 sat/byte, ~30 minutes
- priority: &gt; 198 sat/byte, ~10 minutes
I agree that you should be able to set the number yourself though.

The Avalon 741 is a nice Bitcoin miner that is reliable, supportive of open source and gives you plenty of control.
A GPU alternative is to mine other coins like Ethereum and then to convert them to Bitcoin, or you could use something like NiceHash for this.

Any hints at why this might be? It's a pretty good pool with nice support from Canaan. I would've expected it to support the Bitcoin core developers.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:47:50
The upfront cost of the S9 is 2100 USD to 2550 USD. The upfront cost of the Avalon 741 is 714 USD. So, the S9 costs more than three times more than the 741.
The hash rate of the S9 is ~13.5 TH/s and it runs at ~1375 W. The hash rate of the 741 is ~7.5 TH/s and it runs at ~1000 W. Obviously, the profit value here depends on where you are. The US is at the more expensive end of the scale for electricity, for example.
It is entirely reasonable to factor in the upfront cost because these machines have quite a limited lifespan, and remember that we are now briskly moving to 10 nm fabrication.
I personally am in this not just for profit, but to make Bitcoin run better and to support companies that give me more control. Canaan gives me more control.
@_date: 2017-07-12 17:40:21
You're just listing problems that exist with storing funds with banks. I use Bitcoin because I like to have control over storage of some of my stores of value. Remember that banks provide many, many functions that are not just basic storage of value. They can do trading or investments for you, for example. It is fine to pay people to do trading for you, to make you profit etc.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:23:43
Or, y'know, buy from Canaan, who use pretty open stuff that you can control yourself with a Raspberry Pi running cgminer. The Avalon 741 is lovely.

Let's make an analogy. Imagine that you own a car that appears to be running fine, but you actually know that its engine has been running on far too little oil for a year and is about to seize up and fail. Would it be ethical for you to sell that car to someone if that someone thinks that it is a perfectly healthy car? I say that it would not be ethical to do so. In fact, I'd say that selling the car without saying that it is about to fail is basically fraud.
