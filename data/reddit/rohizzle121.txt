hopefully ill get my coins in my account before bitinstant goes up
@_date: 2012-11-21 04:33:51
i did the instant method because i trust that my bank will refund the transaction if somthing unwanted happen. i always wash my btc with blockchain as well. 
@_date: 2012-11-21 04:14:54
have used it two times so far
first time was awesome and went with out a hitch
second time (today) i was supposed to have funds clear by 5pm and its been 5 hours since then and it says my transaction is completed but i dont have the btc to spend. i sent an email to the support team waiting on a response 
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:05:27
yes there is a lag when selling as well.
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:22:55
i would hate for you to ruin your macbook in an experiment! 
@_date: 2013-04-22 05:33:40
so why is cloudfare not able to stand up against this abuse? (on behalf of mtgox)
@_date: 2013-08-24 23:16:54
Old android phones can't generate pseudo random numbers, there's a bug where it generates the same number over and over again. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 22:54:45
how is the "atm" sending the qr code any different? i am curious
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:32:27
What if the number was something like .000473882727. Does the clients have something like anything greater than &gt;, or does it have to be exact number. I'm having trouble explaining this, I hope you get it. Thanks for your answer
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:49:17


what! that would be so awesome for bitcoin trading.. might move to japan now
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:21:40
they have a resellers section on their website, but i cant find any other info on this other than it being a proof of concept 
@_date: 2013-10-05 04:19:33
No way. They would have to do a 51% attack and that would cost way more than 80 million. Either that or brute force 
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:31:08
anti money laundering 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:53:06
i would always be looking at my pebble if i got this! haha
@_date: 2013-08-25 16:19:28
well the key word is OLD, if the phone is too old to receive updates then the fix would not be applied, right? 
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:57:05
what if you also have an asic rig that you have set to accept only if the fee is a small (less than .00001) random number and use that number for the fee you want to pay when you make a transaction? 
@_date: 2013-03-07 01:45:12
im so sorry :(
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:24:12
dark pool trading doesn't effect the market either 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:15:12
Have you ever tried the P2P direct methods?
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:27:49
Ah ok, that makes sense. I just wished i could have the speed of bitinstant with the fee % of using an exchange. 
@_date: 2013-02-18 07:09:10
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:12:54
Might as well run for president at this point :)
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:37:00
@_date: 2013-02-14 07:41:33
we need a kevin rose of bitcoin.. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:21:30
wow its already at 43, was it just a minor correction? interesting... 
@_date: 2013-08-25 16:32:09
Oh well that makes total sense, i just thought those phones were SOL. thank for clearing that up for me! 
@_date: 2013-03-06 07:21:36
wow i remember back in my day that 5 internets was only 1$! 
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:04:59
why not bitfloor? the % fee is WAY less than bit instant
@_date: 2013-03-04 18:23:21
is Anodized Aluminum what my macbook is made from? 
@_date: 2013-04-01 05:25:55
you summed up the reason why i think btc is gonna fail. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 17:14:55
I got verified to use this feature but its not showing upon the website :(
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:55:46
Why doesn't mt gox use them?
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:35:45
That's why I use it with two fact and not an local client. I trust that they know more about this security stuff than I do. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:32:03
What does this mean? Thanks for the answer 
@_date: 2013-03-05 07:54:08
welp! thats scary. should i sell soon? that is the question 
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:17:46
there is?? could you link it
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:25:34
If you see stuff like this, ignore it. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 03:23:32
This exactly what I was looking for! My friends and I were looking for a place in Europe to stay but most of the hostels are booked. This works out to be cheaper!
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:23:41
I will be visiting Netherlands this summer, I will definitely stop by and use some coin!
