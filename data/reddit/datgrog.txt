The message you reply on just answer or explain your answer. Either you didn't read or care but for what it worth I will highlight it for you:  


\- As Spot get recently redesign with new features such as the segwit compatible wallet, the landing page is not longer relevant, so now it just redirect to the producthunt upcoming spot page.  


\- It will be refresh in the near futur  
\+ Which means it is **only temporary**  


Well, can't arg this much against that, but at the time this webpage was live Spot was really brand new, think about early iteration of a startup's landing page, so It does just go straight to the point of the app feature.   


Thanks for this relevant feedback ��, I assure you next iteration of the website will be better than the basics and hope you will eventually give a try

It's weird it didn't shows up first time you install sure, so I understand your feeling.
Does your android device rather recent? Also, issue like this may occur because of the play store (e.g play store doing many apps update...). Regarding to the wording, there is many app named "spot" at some point. You could understand that it's an unbalanced fight to be better ranked that "spotify" for the word "spot" for this startup... but "spot crypto" which makes sense works.   
It's nice from you to complain about potentially scam so that others don't fall into but I assure you that it's 100% [legit]( (techcrunch article)

The website is "*spot.so"* . As Spot get recently redesign with new features such as the segwit compatible wallet, the landing page is not longer relevant, so now it just redirect to the producthunt upcoming spot page.   
It will be refresh in the near futur but in the meantime you could check what [it looks like before the redirection]( (wayback machine, takes few sec to properly load)

Had the same years ago. Just wink at them without investing yourself by arguing, spending your energy. If you need just throw one or two punchline but not more.

Does it store the seed phrase encrypted or in plane text?
Does it use a custom words list as electrum or the standard's one?
Does it stores bitcoins using bip84 for segwit?
Sorry, I'm building a wallet.

Given this tweet [ it's highly possible it would support lightning as it show multiple startup as crypto gateway   &amp;
