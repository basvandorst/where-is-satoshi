Yes and yes to the above questions. You're right I should put a password on these things. I'm just so lazy. Is buying a trezor easier?

I sold some at $68 made a quick 2k profit in my Roth. If it goes up another $5 I'm getting back in. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:57:59
Holy fucking shit. That's a lot.
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:03:47
Ha I got in at $48 and I fucking crushed it. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 03:06:11
I agree. That's why I'm on the sidelines for now 
@_date: 2016-04-24 03:34:44
I thought that too, but I don't think it makes sense for them to completely ignore us. They know the system can't sustain.

I keep 50 BTC in coinbase's vault. So much easier and honestly I like having someone to yell at or sue if the shit totally hits the fan. This guy has zero recourse.

@_date: 2016-04-23 02:12:11
People undervalue GBTCs long term benefit. The thing about GBTC and hopefully the winkelvoss coin ETF is that in a Roth you won't have to pay tax. Which means in a moon scenario where you had say 50 BTC that you held personally and 50 BTC that you held the paper for (in a Roth) and bitcoin goes to let's say $1,000,000 a coin. You now have $50,000,000 that you don't have to pay taxes on. Which in Bernie sanders America is something like 28 million dollars. So you end up with roughly $75,000,000 instead of 50 mil. That's the real longterm value of these types of funds. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 02:05:55
Same, got out at $68. If it goes to $75 I'll get back in and ride it to $90
@_date: 2016-04-26 05:04:54
I bought in at $210 in early 2015 definitely not an early adopter, but it still feels damn good to have doubled my position. It's all gravy from here on out, unless we implode, but that doesn't seem likely.

We need banks to scale. What's your ultimate goal for Bitcoin, to be used by a small contingent of crypto anarchists, gold bugs and libertarians? Or do you want to make this easy enough for your mom? im definitely in the second camp.

I know this is an unpopular opinion, but bitcoin needs identity. The reason Facebook won the battle for the Internet was because they got identity right. Being anonymous is scary and foreign to people. Transacting money anonymously is still not a concept many people are comfortable with. Now it should be opt in of course, but like Facebook is to the Internet, it's my opinion Bitcoin needs its own walled garden... Eventually. It's too early yet.

You'd be a multi billionaire. If it ever went to a million you'd be able to buy your own sports team and think nothing of it. Crazy shit. At least you had the balls to buy back then. I heard about it and totally ignored it. I thought it was a scam, now I'm evangelical about the tech and the future.

Most people are still largely arrogant/ignorant of bitcoins potential. Fat cats most of all. Plus imagine they do co-opt Bitcoin and cause it to rise to the moon. Then all of us become part of the wealthy elite. The only question then is do you continue the cycle? I know I won't.

Like someone else said, a lot of people here are naive about finance. Obviously the British aren't fleeing into Bitcoin, same as it wasn't the Greeks fleeing into it last year. The instability and uncertainty are driving the price from investors around the world who are losing confidence. The worlds financial markets are linked, a rouge trader in India or South Africa or where ever could bring the world economy crumbling to its knees. It's the world we currently live in. The way the FED runs itself is on the poor premise that an equilibrium model can stabilize markets and keep them in control. They try and create that equilibrium by controlling rates. A little up, a little down until everything is just right. Think of it like the yoke on an airplane. The problem is the world economy is so complex that the airplane could instantly trans morph into a butterfly mid flight and then back to an airplane and then into a giraffe and fall from the sky. Essentially, anything can happen. This is why most of us Hodl, we believe Bitcoin with its simple mathematical rule based system is a rock in this ultra complex world.

Being homeless is quite different from being poor. Poor people have homes/families/support/jobs they're trying their hardest often times to better their situation. Homeless people burned all their bridges long ago. Think about it. Even if you had absolutely no money, I'm willing to bet theirs a friend or family member who would feed you and let you sleep on their couch for an extended period of time. No your plan won't work. If you wanted to create meaningful change find a smart kind from a poor family and give it to him. Your intentions are noble, just misplaced.

I have often wondered the same question. I'm not as technical as a lot of other folks on r/bitcoin, but it seems to me quantum computing would end up enhancing the blockchain.

It's equivalent to giving Jeff Bezos money for Amazon back in '94. It probably looks stupid to outside investors, who aren't well versed in the blockchains potential.

You're right, and he's a really smart guy. Part of the problem may be that I'm the wrong messenger for the message. I mean him taking investment advice from me is a little backwards in how our relationship has been historically. Plus success is a killer, it tricks smart people into thinking they can't lose.

I'm not being dishonest or delusional. Truth is you're 100% right that there is a way to do everything currently in the banking system. I'm not saying there isn't a way to do it. With forethought and planning i could have made things easier and cut out steps. But i didn't think ahead about this purchase. I decided to buy the car on a friday night, posted it to craigslist and made it happen saturday morning. Im not asking you to blindly defend because I'm a bitcoin proponent. But come on, Can't you admit that this would be easier in bitcoin say 10-20 years from now when we could peg the car itself to the blockchain and transfer ownership that way. I'm not saying BTC beats traditional banking right now, but bitcoin is getting better all the time, while banking is stagnant.

I wear an "I accept bitcoin" shirt around frequently and people have 2 reactions. 1. What is bitcoin?  2. Oh, that's a scam. I'm always polite to both and just tell them bitcoin is money for the Internet and it's going to change the way we do commerce.

I agree. Fiat has to be upfront more in this first wave of innovation. People are still scared of bitcoin. Forget everything else, most people just can't stomach the volatility. Basic psychology holds us back in that regard.

I feel like 2015 is the year of "blockchain technology" based on how often I see the incumbent institutions say that. "Well bitcoin is for pimply faced teenagers, but the blockchain..."

Crowdfunded or not most startups will statistically fail, I mean we don't even know if bitcoin will ultimately succeed. So the things being built on the blockchain right now are of course going to be on shakey ground. However I feel the Factom team is hardly running a scheme.

1. ATM was inside the bank. And the dude seemed like he does this a lot. He was buying a truck from another guy the same time I was there. Must have a high limit? We only used the atm because the bank line was long when we were doing the transaction. 
2. Well the car cost 12,000 and I had roughly 6,000 in the joint account I share with my future wife and 6,000 in my personal account at a different bank. If I had sent it there would have been a fee and it would have taken 2 days in my experience. 
3. It could have, but homeboy wanted to pay cash. And my main objective was just getting the car sold. 
Also why would I make this up? Lol it's not like it's that cool that I bought a used car for 12,000

I got in back in january, i flirted with bitcoin back in 2011/2012 somewhere in there. I wanted to buy DMT or something on silk road. Didn't go through with it. Heard about it again in 2013 and kicked myself for not buying some. 
Started making good money for the first time in my life this year and decided to buy some as an investment back in january when the price was around $220. Having that skin in the game really helped educate me on BTC, Blockchain etc... 
I became obsessed and devoured everything i could read. Digital gold by Nathaniel Popper was a favorite of mine. 
At first i diversified, I'm a decent investor and i saw the need to buy crypto's as a space. So i bought BTC, XRP and DOGE. About 80% BTC 20% for the other two. After reading more about the ALT's and the lack of a network effect, 51% attacks etc... i consolidated it all back to BTC. 
After going through the rabbit hole the last few months i've become as hardcore on Bitcoin as anyone from the beginning. It has changed my worldview, Turned me into a raving lunatic at parties and become over 50% of my total investment portfolio. 
Im a stark raving lunatic like the rest of you now, and i went from full on skeptic to believing we can change the world in about 6 months. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:06:27
I don't really care about the price when it's up. Only when it's down so that I can buy more coins. I bought 6 more at $208 USD yesterday. At this point I just count the number of bitcoins I have instead of their USD value. If Bitcoin succeeds, you'll become a millionaire in bits not in USD. I have millions of bits at the moment. This is the digital gold rush, and I'd kick myself if I didn't have at least 1,000,000 bits. HODL down young ones.
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:32:05
It definitely could. I guess we will have to wait and see. 
@_date: 2015-07-26 04:01:34
Lol good point. I don't know if I thought this all the way through.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:49:12
You know what? The more I buy, hold and use bitcoin the more convinced I am of its utility. I hold a decent amount and so while I'm going through this bullshit I'm just thinking Jesus why can't bitcoin be mainstream yet? 
I didn't even get in to it, but the amount of paperwork in my state that has to do with the sale of the vehicle you have to submit to the dmv is ungodly. Imagine if you could just exchange a colored coin and the dmv could check the blockchain and see that the coin was transferred from one drivers license to another. That would make things so easy.
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:53:54
Not a popular opinion, but bitcoin may stay a speculative commodity forever. 
I'm not saying it will, as i think it can compete with the payment processors once the network is more robust. 
I do think theres a possible future where bitcoin is just the commodity backing the widespread use of the blockchain for a host of other purposes. Think of the blockchain like the combustion engine, a true game changer. However it has a symbiotic relationship with gasoline. Bitcoin is gasoline. Now you tell me who had more money, John D Rockefeller or Henry Ford. The commodity that powers the engine has extreme value. 
So while your girl may not buy her shit online in bitcoin anytime soon, it has no effect on the longterm outcome. It may just be different than people realize. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:18:31

Well I have incentive right? I believe bitcoin is going way way up. And I inherit his coins 30 years from now, hoping he holds out that long. Bitcoin is very incentivizing. I even tell my stupid computer illiterate friends about bitcoin, because I want to infect their brain with the word and the thought.

And no I wasn't in back then, so I don't know how hard it was.

Bitcoin will take over the world. It's users are literally invested in it. Once the exodus of the traditional system happens, you won't be able to stop it. It will be exponential.

I had 53,869,500 bits so I bought enough to round out to 54 BTC and help the rally. Did that around $420 so I'm down slightly on those coins but the rest of my coins I acquired around $220-$230. Best decision I ever made was to keep all of my coins in coinbase' s cold storage account. It takes 48 hours to get them out which prevents me from letting my emotions get the better of me during times like this. Promised myself I'd HODL til at least 2030.

You really should be putting 15-20% of your take home pay away for retirement. Not 8-10% as some others have suggested. I guess it depends on what kind of retirement you plan to have though. I'm planning on having a nice lady in a grass skirt bring me booze in a coconut til I pass out on the beach. Lather, rinse, repeat. I don't receive a paycheck though, so when the market is low for Bitcoin a couple times a year I throw $3,000-$5,000 at it. I like to buy 10 coins at a time.

Things don't entice me that much. Why buy a Ferrari when cars will be driving themselves in a few years? You know? Most ferraris are depreciating assets. When the bitcoin market matures there will be multiple opportunities to loan your bitcoins for a healthy bit of interest. Wait til that happens, then you can buy a Ferrari with the interest.

Thinking Bitcoin will have an exponential growth curve is hardly infantile or cultish. I'd describe it as factual. Look at the networks overall growth patterns. It would also be very hard to stop due to its decentralized nature thus "you won't be able to stop it".

Been doing it since last January. I don't know what my average is because I don't care. I get paid sporadically and when I'm paid I like to acquire coins. I want to hit 100 coins. Right now I have 57.7

I'd really like to know the answer to this myself. I'm also purchasing a home and when I found out I have to give almost $2,000 to a private company just so they can tell me I own the home I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars for I was pretty pissed. That's like 6 BTC I could buy instead.

On a regular IRA or 401k that is definitely true and taxes only go up. So it's worth it to have the Roth because you pay the taxes now while it's cheap to do so.

@_date: 2016-05-04 05:58:12
The problem with a lot of early bitcoiners is that they are technical people who don't understand social interaction as well as they should. Look pretty basic... Craig was shifty as hell during that interview, he stonewalled, he used anger to mask lies and his body language was very telling. He's not satoshi.

@_date: 2015-11-04 05:05:41
what's your definition of substantial. Because I'd say it's 100 million+ in which case I think you'll need minimum 100 coins. But good enough to retire on and live an average life not having to take shit from some crappy boss? 1-2 should do the trick ;)

It seems counter intuitive to me that we get excited our Bitcoin is worth a certain amount of fiat. Don't you generally believe if you hodl BTC long enough you won't have to exchange it back to fiat to spend it? Because that's what I believe as a fellow bitcoiner ahem blockchanier... Be happy you have however many BTC you have.

Expected. Bitcoin is open and Russia prefers things closed.
@_date: 2016-05-03 23:16:52
A living satoshi is bad for bitcoin. Especially one like Craig who looks and feels like a sleazy con man. Perception matters, there's this feeling in bitcoin that perfect engineering will fix everything. You still have to sell the general public on bitcoin at some point and Craig makes that harder. So if Craig really did invent Bitcoin then thanks, but we haven't needed you for the last 6 years and we don't need you now. 
P.S. I don't believe he is satoshi, all we have right now is anecdotal evidence to go on

I stopped talking about it awhile ago. I remember giving my aunt a long impassioned speech about why it's great and her telling me there was no intrinsic value and treating it like it was invisible fairy dust. I just sort of was like "ok you don't get it". Funny thing is she really values money and it's going to be hilarious to me when the value hits 100k a coin and I send her a bottle of Dom P. With a note that just says "bought with Bitcoin :)" basically anyone you tell now is getting a golden ticket, but most of them are just crumpling it up and throwing it in the trash. Oh well I guess that's human nature. It takes a certain type to see which way the wind is blowing.

I could have probably paid less, like around $500.

@_date: 2016-05-05 22:45:35
I think it goes against the spirit of bitcoin. Immutable blockchain, move the keys or go home. Plus i've dealt with enough con men in real life (I live in Las Vegas) to know one when i see one. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck and cant move the keys then its probably not satoshi. If he moves the keys tommorow though i will change my mind tomorrow. I'm open to truth, but satoshi has to move the money around or he's not satoshi. Simple as that.

Roth IRA's are extremely powerful investment vehicles due to their tax up front nature. So powerful in fact that the government limits you to $5,500 a year in contributions. With a 401k or a traditional Ira you are paying deferred taxes, this is worse in the longterm because taxes only ever go up. So a lot of us hodling GBTC and eventually the coin ETF (hopefully) in our Roth's are expecting a tax free moon. Which if you believe in the longterm viability of Bitcoin means that we will not have to pay any tax on massively substantial gains. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:53:08
This guys going to be pissed in a few years. Like really? You work for the Wall Street journal and you're super stoked about $450. This is why power always consolidates at the top, because weak hands sell. They sell when it's up and they sell when it's down. I've made 40k profit off my Bitcoin since last year. Could I use that 40k for daily life shit? Yes. Not only on wants but on needs. I sold my car and now I ride a 50cc scooter around like I'm in India. Despite living in a half million dollar house in the nicest suburb in Las Vegas. Want to know why? Because the house is appreciating, the car was not. I made a commitment to being rich, and I don't care if I have to look stupid in the meantime.

It would be awesome if we start exploding right before. Then we can have a bitcoins back podcast.

Think about it like this, if some poor teenager in a slum in Brazil had access to a computer and the internet back in 2008-2009 and was massively interested in Bitcoin, he could be a multi millionaire today. From the poorest of the poor to the richest of the rich all because he used his knowledge to gain wealth. Similarly some Kenyan who saves his extra dollars today in Bitcoin instead of m pesa and is consistent with his savings has the chance to be a millionaire in 10-20 years time. I can't think of a system that's more fair than that.

Just use coinbase and buy some. The Bitcoin community has its roots in extreme libertarianism, but if you're not super duper hardcore just download coinbase and buy some. Easy peasy... And if you're an upstanding citizen who pays their taxes keep your coins with coinbase too. Honestly it's crazy easy.

@_date: 2016-07-01 23:26:55
Your math is off. There will never be 21 million bitcoins available OTC. Probably 3-5 million at least are lost forever and many large holders and institutions will not sell even at a million a coin. So the market cap would not need to reach 21 trillion to have million dollar coins. Even if the market cap reached what gold currently sits at you could have million dollar coins. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 04:58:49
Oh don't get me wrong, I'm excited about that industry. Just think it's too early to call right now. Even though I know there are 100 trillion dollar asteroids out there. In my eyes satoshi has the best shot right now at this moment if he's still alive.

Buffet can buy coins at a million a piece like its nothing. It's best for him to wait until it's a sure thing. Going from 1 million a coin to 3 million a coin on 10 billion dollar investment would generate a 20 billion dollar return. So when it doesn't matter whether they are $1,000, $10,000 or a million a coin. Why should he care yet? Berkshire Hathaway could buy 5 million coins at 100k a piece if they wanted to. When you have that much, you wait.
