Ouch dude that sucks. I also missed a ton of opportunities. The .com address registrations, tons of stock options opportunities, buying a house a few years ago for 30% current prices, missing bitcoin, missing bitcoin AGAIN...
In the end though, 2 things helped me. My down to earth, frugal wife, who really doesn't care much about money. Though I think I'm starting to rub off against her, shit.
And the fact that I know theres another opportunity on the horizon. I'm sure its gonna be as big or bigger then cryptos. Sounds like you'd be the type to not miss that one :)

And if they cash out of BTC, BTC still keeps going down right?

Because a lot of people don't really discriminate different coins. Sure coin x may be more promising than coin y, but in the end all of them are investment vehicles, nothing more to a lot of people.
And in a panic market, the difference between coins matters even less.
