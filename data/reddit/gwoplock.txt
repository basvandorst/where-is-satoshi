How many signatures do you have currently. Estimated or actual is ok.

That's not what I said. What I said was *MOST* searches fall into those 3 categories.

Anyone could build a website, post to Reddit, ext. claiming that they are running for x office in x location but without the number of signatures that is worthless. I'm not calling you a lier but can you understand my skepticism with the number of political campaigns posting here.

You where right till you said that focusing on the 3 would hurt them. Those 3 are usually what people are going to want to do. Google knows this and they shape their search result page to this. For example if I wanted to know about Bitcoins Google does an image search finds the most common image and puts it In a box or I grabs the wiki page picture. They then take the first paragraph of the wiki article and put it below the picture. Then it grabs any other relevant information from the wiki page and puts it there too. and thats doesn't even talk about how results are ordered.

Do the same, after BTC I now use USD or us dollars when talking about money.

I think it is in a Wallet. But I don't think there is one for each person signed up. What do you mean by "bitcoin account"? I haven't heard that term before.

Yes, you don't have a btc wallet through bitcointip. If I remember correctly it just knows your balance. For more info read Sent from mobile

i just read this and they make some valid points but i have some questions.
1. how credible is this site / author
2. is this an article made to scare people, and keep them out of BTC
3. if ? is true, why
4. why do we get no media attention when we are growing but when we fall we get a lot of media attention (ex: the most resent crash, mt. gox ddos/tech issues, bit-floor closing) 
5. along with ? bit-floor closeing is like a biz closing, normally when a biz closes they get no media attention, what made bit-floor different other than being tied to bitcoin
6. my mom says "bitcoins are monopoly money" how true is this statement and how should i respond
7. what is the dividing line between "monopoly money" and "money"
8. USD is a currency bitcoins appear to be the same thing, what makes bitcoins not a currency

The US debt ceiling kicks in.

i don't think we are at the top. look at the log scale. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:56:16
yes but i can then instantly fund my mt.gox account from my bank account. second if paypal ties to by wallet then i can use BTC for anything that accepts paypal
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:20:17
what was wrong that question

I see 3 ways this can work:
1. (Bank &lt;-&gt; )PayPal &lt;-&gt; mt.gox &lt;-&gt; BTC
2. (Bank &lt;-&gt; )PayPal &lt;-&gt; BTC
3. PayPal uses BTC
Just for refrence how it is now: bank &lt;wire transfer (0:30 -1:00 hr)&gt; bitinstant &lt;-&gt; (mt. Gox &lt;-&gt;) BTC
For the first way I can have instant transfers to Mt. Gox. For the second way I can have instant transfers to BTC. The third way I like the best becouse BTC now is my standerd $. Any way they chose a few things hapen:
1. BTC gets noticed
2. It is easier to get BTC
3. It shows (for lack to a better word) trust
4. I can use BTC for anything that excepts Paypal.
