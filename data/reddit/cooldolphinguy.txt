Birds is really just a cool way to spread the word about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. You're really overdramatizing it.

They really don't like "bcash", since they see themselves as the original Bitcoin. 
They see BTC as a coin corrupted by Blockstrean, and BCC as the coin sticking to Satoshi's original vision.

Close. They read the whitepaper.

I feel like Bitcoin Core is the one riding on the Bitcoin name, seeing as it is sticking to the original view of Bitcoin while Bitcoin Core's direction has been changed by Blockstream.

Let me explain a more accurate analogy:
Imagine if a couple guys joined Ford as engineers because they loved cars. Then imagine if Henry Ford decided to make boats instead. Now these couple of guys decide that they want to make a car again and decided to name their business Ford Classic.
Bitcoin Cash exist because people don't like the influence of Blockstream on Bitcoin Core. Tbh, the mass censorship and change in direction for the worst is the reason why I'm leaning towards Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin Core.

I like to know the market I'm investing in. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:42:13
Nope. I did a very large amount of research and didn't go to bed until the early hours of the morning.

Official ticker is BCC, not BCH. Although Bitcoin Connect already has the ticker BCC, Bitcoin Cash has made it clear that they don't really care.

Couldn't I say the same?

It's insignificant. If you wanna claim to be Satoshi, that's fine. I can choose to not believe you. It's no crime to do so.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have a CEO.
Claiming to be Satoshi isn't a punishable crime by US law.
Wishing that governments would "crack down on Bitcoin" is the most backwards thing any crypto enthusiast has ever said.
Claiming that you want these people to get arrested reminds me of those stupid "Hillary for jail" type phrases people said during the 2016 US election.

I don't have anything against BBQcoin per se.
If you wanna use BBQcoin over BTC due to lower fees, go ahead. That's what the free market is all about: people choosing a commodity that fits their needs most.
The reason I mention BCH is because it's high market cap. A big factor in choosing a commodity as a medium of exchange (albeit not the only factor) is network effect. If I accept a currency, I need to know that other people will as well, otherwise I'll opt in for a more widely accepted currency. By accepting BCH, I can reasonably expect other people to accept it as well. I can't say the same for BBQcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:25:25
Then what did you find to be incorrect?
Also, do you actually think fees aren't an issue? Because if so, you'll never solve a problem you won't admit is there. The first step is acceptance.

I'm not spreading propaganda; I'm starting a discussion for open discourse. If you've got a point to debate or find something innacurate in my article, I'd love to hear your critique.
Otherwise, just because something counters your current way of thinking doesn't make it propaganda or shilling. Anybody who thinks so is resisting open discourse and is desperately trying to retain a closed mind.
If you'd rather, we can move this discussion over to the comment section of the article, where neither of our post are subject to censorship.

PM me your price before you dump, I could use a top-up on my stash.
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:23:02
You're condemning my work as propaganda without reading it, simply because it expressed a viewpoint that infringes your cognitive dissonance? That's some insecure level of closed-mindedness. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:18:42
If you've got any critiques or inaccuracies you'd like to point out, I'm all ears. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 02:07:57
Any critiques? Arguments? Inaccuracies you'd like to point out? I'm all for open discourse.
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:20:55
I think you're confused on how to use quotations. You see, when you place a sentence in quotation marks, that sentence must be an exact quote. However, you're stating that I used the term "bcash", even though I clearly wrote "Bitcoin Cash". 
I briefly addressed LN, however the shortfalls of LN are a topic for another article. Overall, LN in a complete, ideal state would be heavily inconvenient and representative of a modern banking network, as compared to a crypto currency who's mainchain is capable of scaling. LN does nothing to combat the banking powers that be. Not to mention that it's not complete and functional as is, and we don't know when it will be.
