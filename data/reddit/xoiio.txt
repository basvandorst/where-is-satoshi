Man, I just need to sell the amount I thought was actually good (about $900 cad) and be done with bitcoin, I mean jesus, enough to buy a house in two years.
I wish I had a job back when bitcoin was actually reasonable to purchase, instead of requiring an entire paycheck like it did not quite so long ago.
I figured maybe I could use it to buy a mid range video card or something and see if I could make it back, but I don't know if mining is even viable anymore unless you are loaded enough to buy like, 10 gpu's at once.

Man, I should have sold the bit I got that was worth about a grand canadian when I had the chance, I was hoping it would hit 1100.
Hopefully it goes back up at a time that I am not working so I can cash out, I don't have enough money to make money from bitcoin :/

Fucking hell, and I thought the fact that the puny amount I have which was worth ~900 a couple hours ago was a lot :/

At least you had that much money to loose at some point lol, plus it's likely to rise again.

I'm just wishing I had sold the little bit I've mined over like, three years on and off for the $1k or so it was worth when I had the chance.
Popping on to this reddit and seeing some of these posts just sunk in how shitty my life is, I was hoping to just be done with it and maybe treat myself to something, but I was dumb and was hoping to hit 1100.
Didn't help that I had to wait 3 days for an account to be verified on quadrigacx during the peak.
What really annoys me and I'm sure lots of others is that back when bitcoin was still relatively new/cheap it was really cool and I would have loved to buy some, but I had no money whatsoever, chances of hitting anything like bitcoin again are virtually none now, even if I put all the money I made from mining into some gpu's I don't think it would really have a decent ROI, and I can't afford an asic miner.
Guess the rich are the ones that get richer after all. Guess it's basically the same for stocks too. It just grinds me down more every day to see how much better most people around me, even in real life, have it, and sure, yeah compared to lots of people in third world countries, yes I have it good, but that doesn't change it, I'm not witnessing that every day.
Hell, there are comments in this thread alone about people spending as much as I'd make in an entire year on bitcoin, because they could "afford to loose it".

Ah, interesting, I didn't know there was a difference when it came to coinbase.
