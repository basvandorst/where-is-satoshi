If you do margin trade and you’re a beginner then when deciding what you do listen to what your gut feeling is and then do the opposite since successful trading goes against human nature.  Also professional trading isn’t exciting as you would imagine since to do it properly you’re only allowed to trade a very small percentage of your capital and the graph of your balance over time is supposed to have a very slight upward slope with no big spikes up and down and you only make money due to compound interest type effects so it’s actually very boring to do it properly.

No, the volume should be the same.  Leverage just affects how much you need to have in your account (margin) to complete the trade.  If you don’t have a high enough balance it will not let you complete the order so you can increase the leverage in that case (but increasing leverage increases risk in that your position will be liquidated much faster if the market goes in the wrong direction).  For example with 1BTC at 2x leverage you can make a 2BTC sized trade, but at 4c leverage you can make a 4BTC sized trade.  Don’t forget you have to pay interest (roll over fees) on the position size.
Keep a record of your orders etc. in a separate system, i.e. a spreadsheet.  You also need your own set of records in case they make any errors.

But if you do decide to margin trade then use it as a tool in the opposite way that you would naturally.  For example with 4x leverage, instead of making your order size 4x larger than you normally would keep it the same size.  This will mean you can do 4 times the number of trades with the same amount of money and look at trading pairs that loop around in the same exchange , e.g. BTC/USD, BTC/ETH and ETH/USD in case the pairs become mis-priced relative to each other.
The problem is the mis-pricing would have to be large due to trade spread and trade fees.
