You need to mention that apple unlimited makes cheaper products, just like btc cash fees are lower.

There is an element of risk in all investments, let's not forget about Mt Gox. Bitcoin is not immune to price fluctuations.

No, I didn't specify which altcoin. There are a few good ones out there that have potential. 'High' is also subjective, the prices one year ago was also quite high. Bitcoin is also considered 'High atm, so you making no sense.

Bitcoin will only survive if it's scalability issues are resolved. Atm it is not and confirmations are taking forever. 48 hours is not acceptable.

Bitcoin is unlikely to change your life significantly as your late to the game, especially when it's only 5% of your salary, unless you are a millionaire. The price and transaction fees are too high and its market share is dropping day by day. There will eventually be a day when btc will be dethroned, unless segwit &amp; LN happens.

Altcoins are better investment with low starting capital.

This is bullshit. Ledger is selling these devices without telling us that only 5 coins can be installed at anyone time. They are being dishonest about the capacity of their devices.

What do you mean by going after those who done it? It's  rather vague term. Who exactly? Civilians? Terrorist recruiters?

Depends on which community, not the bitmain community. Majority users wants faster and low costs.
