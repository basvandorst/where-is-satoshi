I hope it goes to negative 1 so I can buy a billion. If your in this to get rich tomorrow your in it for the wrong reasons. Miss the old days of Bitcoin on here. Nowdays it's a bunch of scmucks who can't even take the time to research 1 article on Bitcoin but will invest their life's savings because their friend said it will make them rich. Just remember. To the moon����

The end goal is the original goal, not some get rich scheme. I love all the people who have bought into bitcoin as we wouldn't be here today without everybody. But I am getting tired of new people hopping on and asking what to do, or when to buy or sell. Keep scrolling, I promise you you will find about 1btc equivalent of posts����

You don't own it theoretically until it's secured by you only

Oh my God sell sell sell!!!!!
I'm so tired of new people who jumped on the bandwagon to make a quick buck come on here posting this Shi every ten minutes. It's Bitcoin, it's what it does.����

Not with how the media is treating Bitcoin currently

People are going to tell you no way blah blah blah but I agree. Majority of people only got into bitcoin to make a quick profit instead of it's intended purpose. Blockchain is an amazing technology, I wish we put more emphasis on why Bitcoin is bitcoin
