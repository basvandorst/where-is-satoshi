People have very strong and different opinions on this. Personally I would say mining with a cpu and several gpu's is worth it. It is versatile enough, blockchain technology is not going anywhere and even if it does you got yourself a nice gaming/rendering /ai training/whatever rig. Not counting electricity cost you can't lose money imho. Just don't buy asics.

Application-Specific Integrated circuit. Those boxes that can only mine a few or even only one currency. They are extremely expensive, become less and less effective and if the currency you mine with it goes to shit you can't even use it for gaming or working. Also the resell value is horrible. So just don't. Buy a pc.

It became a meme after some guy tried to type holding while drunk of his ass.

The idea sounds interesting, but didn't we all come here for the money (if we are really honest to ourselves)? So spending money here, potentially more than we won, wouldn't make sense to me.
Still would donate tho.

I think it is the only solution as it saves you a lot of money and gives you the opportunity to specialize it for its purpose. That's what I meant by buying a pc, buy the parts and put it together yourself. I did that for 3d rendering and when I don't have to render it mines for me. Might take a while to break even, but I have an awesome pc when I need it and when energy is free, why not take it and turn it into money?

I hodl long term so it doesn't really matter for me. But I was excited about the 20 000€ btc, which was unfortunately obviously an error.
