Sorry for the delay in responding . I just added it up for July and they took about 4.4% of my monthly take home. I have it set to one level more aggressive than the default setting -- you can adjust it however you like. Highly recommended!

OK hold on a second here. Forget about BTC for a second (hard to do). If I do my friend's taxes (a service) and they "pay me" with a six-pack and a pizza, i'm supposed to report as part of my income the fair market value of the six pack and pizza?
What about them reporting the value of having one's taxes done?! 
Are both goods AND services received taxable?
This seems crazy.
Unless you're just talking about sales tax. But when one party pays the other in currency, it seems quite clear who made the sale, and therefore who owes tax. But in a barter situation, which side owes tax? Both sides??

What is the difference between my wallet and my friend's wallet? If my friend wants to buy .01 BTC from me and I agree to accept $150 in USD for that .01 BTC, and then I sent the BTC directly to my friend, wasn't there a sale?
But I guess that's no different than any other cash transaction between two parties. Isn't that one of the things we all liked about BTC from the beginning?
So is the only difference between a peer-to-peer transaction and a deposit or withdrawal to/from an exchange is the fact that the exchange is a regulated business and therefore under some obligation legally or otherwise to report this transaction?

This isn't really Bitcoin-related, but I notice several commenters mentioning being less disciplined when they used traditional savings account. I had the same situation. Aside from having a similar experience with Bitcoin to you all, I also found a service called Digit which is super helpful for saving fiat. It takes money out of your account automatically without ever overdrafting you, by analyzing your transaction history (you can tweak its aggressiveness as well if you want). The algorithm is very smart. It's separate enough from my checking that I don't have the temptation to try to transfer it back in or cash it out, like I did when my checking and savings were with the same bank. And it takes a small enough amount at a time that I never miss it, never notice it's gone. And yet in just a few months there's already several hundred there! I highly recommend it for those whose diversification still includes fiat.
edit: i am not affiliated with Digit in any way, i just honestly believe it's helped my money management.
