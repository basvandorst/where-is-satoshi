Read it a long time ago. You've misunderstood a few things and made several assumptions but not to worry

I don't see that many miners switching off unless the price is stupidly low. They may have a window of like two months where they keep persisting but what i can't see is Bit Fury, BTCC et al all switching off at once. They will be planning for all eventualities in terms of running costs i imagine.

Many thanks. Will get back to you soon or in the morning. Had a lot of messages all at once

I certainly was

That's all helpful thanks. Regarding your first point, i intend to demonstrate this with two transactions. A high fee and no fee so that whoever im talking to can see it on a block explorer. 
Your second point - i'm not going to pull the wool over anyones eyes in regards to volatility. I'll be recommending businesses use Bitpay to mitigate the risk if they are concerned about it. 
I admit i fell into the change address trap in the past so will be making people aware of this too

I'm in no way expecting to do this full time and no i did not quit my job to do it. I think the tech can help alot of people but organizations need someone with a better understanding to get the best out of it. It is quite complicated to newcomers

If you don't think the tech helps people or value it why are you on this sub?
