As a non-bitcoin person, what is the difference between [this]( and [this]( image? I like to read up on bitcoins, but I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at when it comes to this tweet. Is the information presented in a way to make it seem more favorable or am I missing something?

Everyone keeps giving me a physical comparison. This is hardly accurate.

I'm assuming I meant linear?
Edit: I don't think he should be getting downvoted. He corrected me.

But what kind of compensation would you expect if someone stole something with almost zero intrinsic value? If someone stole monopoly money from you, what compensation would you expect?

If someone stole your monopoly money, what compensation would you expect?

I understand much better now thanks to your post. I appreciate the response.


Would you say this a fair representation in this situation? Why not use a ~~algorithmic~~ linear (excuse me if this terminology is wrong) chart?

Is $10 to $20 actually meaningful in this situation? It feels like anything sub-$100 per bitcoin was a pretty different time.

Hmmm... Very interesting. This seems to be something that is more relevant to stocks, correct? Why does return on investment matter? I was under the impression that bitcoin should be viewed as a currency. Isn't the general consensus that people treating bitcoin like a stock is a bad thing?

If we're being honest, you need to choose between regulated or unregulated. Can't have your cake and eat it too as the saying goes.
Edit: Didn't except these replies so quickly. My question to these replies is, "What compensation would you expect for the theft of bitcoin? What compensation would you expect for the theft of monopoly money?"
I'm making conversation. My mind is open to a change of opinion. No need to get upset.

Except those things actually exist in a physical way. Bitcoins are information. It really has no intrinsic value.

Thanks for taking time out of your day to reply anyways.
