Three responses so far and none of them can explain it.  What was their point in responding?  Don't be like those dicks.

Thanks.  I'm going to try to understand this but it looks above my head and doesn't go into the Bob sent Alice x kind of scenarios I was hoping for.  I really don't know what they are talking about when they say input/output.
All I know is I was sending people x amounts of bitcoin and now, it just doesn't feel safe anymore.  Why should I trust electrum?  Why do we use this change address bullshit?  This seems like a hack.  Basically they invented this concept because they don't trust that some other method is available to hack bitcoin if people send from the same addresses.

Whatever man.  All I can tell you is hundreds or thousands of folks are losing bitcoin each week because of this kind of thing.

My brother just emailed me and told me about the bitcoin bowl.  He knows nothing about it and it interested him.

I tried understanding this but the way they are using the terms input and output just makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:57:51
Nope.  I guess there's no need to keep bitcoin then.  
The funny thing is I doubt you understand it either.  Is that your life?

Explain or stfu.  Don't be a simpleton pumper.

I think they are reusing the same addresses they sent from but I have no clue why that even matters.  It appears to me that if you can't even do that with bitcoin then it's just plain faulty.
Thanks for the first decent response.

Thank you.
I don't disagree but it's hard as fuck and there are no simple tutorials.  You basically have to have a phd in math to understand bitcoin and then know what's going on as the shit hits the fan with all the clients, etc. over time.
I don't consider myself non-technical but the problem is the math and the explanations NEVER take into account people like that.  I guess if you have to have a PHD in math to be considered technical then I'm not technical.
Also, things like change addresses spook me.  This seems totally hackish--almost like they gave up on security.  Basically change addresses are saying, "We can't get security right if you use the same address more than once so we'll make things infinitely harder by requiring you to have a shit ton of addresses to do the simplest of things."  That's the way it appears.
Also, it's only a matter of time before coinbase fucks up.  I mean blockchain supposedly had an industry guru working as the Chief Security Officer and they mess up something this important?

Warren Buffet is the Lance Armstrong of the financial world.  He's a criminal that has cheated, lied and stole his way to the top.  Google it if you don't believe me.

So says the Lance Armstrong of the financial world.  
Warren Buffet is a fucking criminal.  This has been proven time and again but people ignore the evidence. 
When Warren Buffet tells you to stay away from something, 9 times out of 10 it's because he knows he will influence a lot of idiots blindly following him and he makes his money off of something that would compete with what he's telling you not to invest in.  
Don't invest in bitcoin in 2015 and watch what the fuck happens in 2016.  Bitcoin will certainly be over 1500 by the end of 2016.
