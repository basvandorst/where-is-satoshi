That isn't true. Most overdrafts occur because of pokery/jiggery of deposit credits versus debit timelines. Irresponsible bookkeeping is not the primary cause.

To the contrary, the definition of waste is totally relevant. Example, you raise chickens, and put heaters in the coop with your peeps, to keep them warm when it gets cold. Let's also assume you sell no chickens, and you neither sell nor give any eggs to anyone except you. Now here's a Family down the road that has no heat, and no electric, and asks to plug in a heater on your energy supply to stay warm, and you say, I can't spare the electric, I need it for my chickens. Would the Family that's cold think your chicken heater is a waste of energy? The point is, your argument is based on what your definition of waste is, that's where the entire argument begins, and also where it ends. Who are you to determine what is waste and what is Value usage of energy consumption for everyone else?

I agree with you, a blind man can see it, I have friends that used to have thriving retail, and it's gone. The only places still operating are the big corporates who can leverage economy of scale, even the little insurance people can't make it, because people use the websites of the behemoths, cut the middleman office out to save money.
Everyone one of these closed shops has a magnifying effect on everything else, and yet Wall Street is whistling past. I appreciate the part where you said trading back and forth with themselves, they're already doing just that. There's so many fingers in that Wall Street pie already, the trickle the guy on the street gets is shrinking. That's why crypto markets are so attractive, because the small investor has a chance to line up at the trough and wet their beak. But that's also why many Wall Streeters and Banks are envious of it. Not only is US money flowing to it, but currency from all over the world, 24/7.

I agree with you, and if not for technology that empowers the ruling class, these metals would still skyrocket in value. The problem I see with precious metals going forward is they don't assist the ruling class in surveillance and control of world assets, but digital tracking does.

The fact that Stripe is not relevant to the success of Bitcoin, just as Circle wasn't either, a business model that seeks to become an additional layer of processing for Bitcoin usage.
I remember Circle stating similar arguments about Bitcoin during the Segwit war with big blockers, and of course at that time Bitcoin was considerably less valuable than now, and I recall the same Bitcoin type obituary being cited as reason for Circle pulling out.
Instead of an objective article on this latest announcement by the author, it is skewed with negative bias towards Bitcoin. 'nail in the coffin of Bitcoin?', how ridiculous.

They were obviously have no shame, even some openly flaunt their vacation pictures, even now, bragging about their wealth from selling for Fiat, while telling people strong buy.

Sure the alterior motive is to keep you locked in the debt-money- from- nothing plantation. That's why Banker Coin Ripple seems to rally while others are not. Ripple the Bankers Coin, unlimited amounts of digital pump, backed by unlimited amounts of Fiat currency.
Bitcoin has helped thousands to right themselves financially, that's why the Debt Money System is fighting it every step. The Debt Money creators want to pick the winner's, not the people, that's the only reason Shit Banker Coins rally, the Banks are pumping them now to try and stop Bitcoins rise.

Yeah sure, Bitcoins growth has been organic, by and for the masses of people that want a place better than a Central controlled rigged ledger, that don't pay squat to savers.
Banks, on the other hand, LOVE some of the Coins that compete with Bitcoin, that are also centrally controlled. The problem is, these fake people's tokens can't pass the smell test from the World's Best developers, you cannot BS the developers, they know what is really a liberating vehicle, and what are fake coins, that are really the same as the rigged Central control money we have now.
The advantage the Banks want is to pump up the value of the Banky coins, and misdirect the public, to chase Fiat gains and not look under the hood. Do Your research on these Coins, before you invest, don't just look at the Marketcap.

Because the Banks are buying drinks at the ripple bar, and they can print any amount of paper money they like to run the board on ripple. It will pass all market caps, but there's so much of it, just like Fiat, only the banks will win. Check Mate.

I hope people begin to understand what Atomic Swap means, that works with Segwit. It means Peer to Peer cash system. A Central coin Mining and Node Cartel, that enriches a few big insider's and exchanges, who all take a big bite out of your crypto pie, is NOT the original scope of Bitcoin. 
These other coins are not trying to replace Visa, they are trying to BE Visa. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:41:15
They're obviously not interested in properly informing people, epic fail on the medias part. Of course why would they? They know Fiat is dying, but they have instructions to Pump the fake crypto instead, the coins that can be controlled by Central Authority.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:52:54
True that, they're pumping Ripple hard to try and entice the dumb money. As long as the buyers don't look under the hood of the vehicle. They got gobs of Fiat to throw at it.

Yes, it's interesting that they mostly comment about Bitcoin, and absolutely Zero is mentioned about the Banker coins on the market. Zero, no matter how much of a rip-off they are. I say that because some of these other coins are just like Central Banks, and hence why the Media stays off the subject of their pumps.

Lower cost to mine Monero, then you could use the Monero to get Bitcoin. To my knowledge unless you joined a mining pool for Bitcoin, the cost to set up enough mining rigs and power them up would be considerable.

Yeah, I saw this post early this year, back when the mempool was being spammed before the NYA was signed.

It's sad, but honestly guys like crame carry the water for the rigged juiced up markets, cuz, well that's his job, that's what he gets paid to do, carry their water, and only report what he's allowed.

@_date: 2017-12-28 23:43:04
Umm, ripple has already uncrowned BCash for 3rd place.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:42:59
Yes, Yes, and Yes. If people would just open their critical thinking,(which most will not), they could see clearly what motivates these people. They listen instead to the 'Satoshi Vision' lines and completely miss the point.
These advocates of BCash want a coin their Asic Miner's can benefit mining.
They don't want a Segwit Bitcoin because it eliminates these Miner's advantage.
Some Exchanges don't want Segwit because it enables Peer to Peer coinswap, without a Middleman, (the exchange).
They have invested capital in these Legacy crypto systems, and they enjoy their dominance over same.
Don't listen to the 'Satoshi Vision' lines, where these peoples treasure is, the heart is also. Just ask yourself this question, Do you honestly think that these people are going to dominate Global Finance going forward? Enjoy the ride.

I listened to this broadcast and Lopp does a fantastic job explaining the difference in security models.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:57
I have to agree with you, this is what greater adoption has brought from rising prices. Many that have arrived the past month are because of FOMO, not because they wanted a better means of exchange. The forums remind me of the penny stock forums from days of old, with the Same get rich quick, lemme pump my coin mentality. They haven't studied Nakamoto consensus, they have no idea who Ver is, or Jihan, AsicBoost, or the NYA, or even No2x. Nor do they seem to care, only how much Fiat they can cash out with, as quickly as possible.

One very important reason is so that someone doesn't sell you Bitcoin they don't even have. That's why it's important to take possession of your private keys after purchase. Same as having the deed to your land. Then you can use a full node to verify yourself of the transaction taking place. See Lopp on Twitter, and read His pinned tweet.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:12:53

The Central Bank can create as much money as they like, so no, I don't believe they're in a neutral corner when it comes to a threat to their product. Anyone that accepts that neutral notion is being naive. Do I believe they are against all crypto? No, not if they can control it. There are alternatives to Bitcoin right now that would be ripe for Central Bank usage and control, the key is making the masses believe they chose it, not central planners. This is already happening now, as people chase the coin with the price in the green, with no regard to pre-mined free coin to creators, nor the fact that some of these coins are not immutable ledger, are not DeCentralized in control, and have terrible security features. These coins, not being permission less, offer no real security to the individual holder, if the coin masters decide to shut them off. At that point, why not just use the system we already have?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:57:19
That'll be about the time certain BTC owners will start dumping BTC. IMO

Agreed, the store of value part is a given, in fact, current events only reinforce the utility of Bitcoin, e.g., Saudi Arabia, etc. In a world of Oath Breakers , Bitcoins have greater value. Those guys in Saudi just had their financial clocks cleaned, and this won't be the last instance of these types of money grabs. As the instigator gets favorable press coverage from this grab of wealth, it will embolden more despots to take action against the wealthy.

Actually, Bitcoins system brings people economic freedom without chains. If any coin out there was the Beast Coin, I would say ether for sure, not Bitcoin. Ether used their system with the UN to retina scan people in the 3rd World. Never heard of Bitcoins doing that, have you?

I think the Narrative lately with Amazon and crypto is to drive interest towards the Banker Coin, ether, because it is centralized, with no cap on coins, so it's basically just like Fiat, I really don't see any difference, that's why it gets all the corporate love. That's why it's being pushed by paid marketing teams, where Bitcoins growth has been organic, ether is like a car commercial during a sporting event.

Yes, their coup has failed, now it looks like some different FUD coming, and now miracles of miracles, Banker Coin just had millions of customer funds frozen by an oooops, and look and behold the value of Banker coin rises anyway. If that was Bitcoin it would have been in the news cycle everyday, and the Fud aftermath constant. Since they're competitors, you cannot help but to draw parallels from how both are treated in the court of public discourse, and it's rather obvious which coin is preferred by the Corporates.

It's quite easy to see where we are different as I'm obviously more willing to be open to differing points of view, whereas you stated that alternate viewpoints to your own, should remain silent. Just because we wish things to be or remain a certain way we like, doesn't mean their isn't other people that want to change it for their own personal advantage. The latest drama of Bitcoin is a prime example. The only reason I shared my point of view is so people would be aware of the possibility of the outcomes of some of the efforts underway, in my opinion, that perhaps seem  mysterious and unexplainable. I see many actions being taken to not empower the individual, quite the contrary. I never said there was a big bad guy, maybe that's what you envisioned when you read what I wrote. I think everything always comes back to people of course, and not just social networks, but in all types of mutual human endeavor. There are people that do very bad things to others, and some of them no doubt are involved in crypto currency and the many other realms of financial pursuit. I care about the Bitcoin community and I share many of their beliefs in economic empowerment to the world, and wouldn't want to see it damaged by bad actors.

Confusion is exactly what I'm talking about. Difficulty Adjustment brings Miner's back to BTC, the mempool starts clearing, the uninformed investors are only looking at the price, they want to see hope in higher prices, and then Bitcoin Cash Cheerleaders start a selling wave to drop the market, hoping to further damage Bitcoin. All I'm saying is in my opinion that may happen.

But that's only with open lines to arb those events, that's why there's trip wire/circuit breaker type protection to prevent that type of gaming. Just because there isn't a standard written that these circuit breakers exist for crypto exchanges, doesn't mean they have zero means to halt game theory, they do, they can just call it something else.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:56:54
Costs to mine versus fixed price of future coins in contracts. Allows Miner's to guarantee a price to market, like Farmer's and their crops.

Even though your post is littered with insults, and unfounded accusations, I will take a moment to share the link so you can read different perspectives on the loss of net neutrality, and what net censorship is bringing. It's also been widely covered by the EFF and others so it's not really clear what you're referring to. I don't believe in a good future for Ethereum, and if you read some of the information put out by Whale Panda on the subject, and others, perhaps you may view their efforts differently. Maybe you've reached the maximum information that you are capable of processing.

It's the dumbing down of the internet. Instead of the Andrew Carnegie school of thought, that knowledge should be accessible for anyone no matter their station in life, we are going to regress to the age of cult Feudalism, where only gilded members of society have access to advanced knowledge and economic advantage. That's what you're going to see.

Agreed, People are buying because they want a future return on their investment, NOT because of a fork. How can you tell? Cause they show up here asking what this fork stuff is all about, AFTER buying Bitcoin.

I'll tell you what I think, if this was supposed to be good for BTC, then Ether would be getting the same attention, but it's not. The same with gyrations in the BTC pricing, very volatile at times, ether on the other hand, even with no buyers, the price hardly moves. Look at the auction data for ether on gemini, it's abysmal, yet the price isn't adjusting down to meet buyers price? No, I think Bitcoin will overcome these obstacles, but don't be mislead, the Banks hate Bitcoin.

I can't answer that, read the CME announcement, Andreas was an adviser on the BRR, and he made it clear on Twitter that was all the extent to his involvement, and CME mentioned that Kraken was one of several different venues for reference rate.

Can't dispute that, the timing is suspect because the LedgerX listing provided the underlying parts for btc, so ETF could be approved. Now suddenly out of nowhere, CME steps up, and it's going to make it a cash settled future, not with BTC. Considering how they've helped hammer gold and silver, what can we expect? Another red flag is Ether isn't getting the same attention. They shield their little banker coin from volatility and it's obvious.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:22:34
As for the Miner's, they really have no financial reason to push for a potential unstable upgrade to blocks, with Future contracts coming on CME, they can protect their mining investment, just like Farmer's protect their future results.

Okay, we seem to be done here. I pointed out several places you can find out that informational flows are being curtailed, and you insist on refuting these issues with nonsensical responses like 'weird ass phrases', 'doomsday predictions', your words, not mine. I think you've adequately demonstrated your lack of any tolerance of differing points of view, and since we began this dialogue,  you've attempted trying to attack the messenger because you don't like the message. My only regret in this exchange is that you were not equipped with enough skills at debate to point/ counterpoint on an issue, only to put words in someone else's mouth and use words like 'insane', etc.. Based on your own remarks that some people should have no voice or venue, perhaps indicated that you prefer echo chambers surrounding you, so that you may have a more comfortable internet experience. You have not demonstrated that there are no serious actions currently underway to suppress information on the web, and to the contrary, I have provided some credible links that expose these efforts, and yet here you go once again, back to insults. Good day.

You're very correct on store of value, as we heard last week, news of fake gold, a product of the mint itself, it only highlights the security of Bitcoin versus tangibles that are not Tamper resistant.

I see alot of positives heading in Bitcoins direction. The developers have some really excellent upgrades to introduce going forward, and I see an end coming to this drama. What we're seeing is small players being pushed aside as we go mainstream. The alt coins are going the way of pink sheet stocks, and the leaders in Crypto have been crowned. The Failed ICO market is a stain on the industry, but that will also be pushed aside. The business model was doomed from the start, you cannot reward People with cash for something they haven't done yet, it doesn't work, because the incentive is gone. The Bitcoin model is the best, we have the greatest developers in the world, collaborating on a payment system, that is literally, a gift to the World.

I formulated my opinion on the Banker Coin by watching what transpires around it. I don't give much credence to lip service because actions speak louder than words. If I carefully watch the market and see anomalies that can't be easily explained, that can be a flag of something going on. When you see a coin suddenly spring forth to grab the number 2 spot against something so obviously better in everyway, but yet number 2 is somehow gaining traction in the race, at the same time as slamming into the walls and making out stops, you have to start asking why is it that it's price doesn't move? I extrapolate auction data on number 2, and even with almost no volume, the price barely budges? Then, it just makes a giant oooops, and locks up millions of customer funds and the value is suddenly higher? Why would an incident like that instill confidence in the banker coin? Answer, it wouldn't. Maybe in the Bizarro banker world where all error is papered over.

What I learned about block chain from Andreas Antonopoulos was incredible, he's just about the best public speaker in the space. One of his speeches he addressed the fact that a permissioned, centralized block chain is just a database, with a new catchy title. If 3rd Parties can alter the chain anytime, then the benefit to the end user is minimal. That's the part I understand the best, and why it's difficult to change Bitcoin. Bitcoin requires consensus of the majority of participants, so therefore it can remain as the people's coin. I see that as a feature, not a bug, but power/profit first People don't like that idea. They want to hurry up and compete with Visa/MasterCard, even if their changes are buggy and risky to the Blockchain. Look at Bch, they're already forking and they haven't been running even 90 days. They don't have the calm steady technical prowess that Core developers possess. We, (Bitcoin participants) have the greatest software coders in the World working on our behalf.

Meanwhile Ether waits in the wings, their Corporate Banker Coin, that has been shielded from volatility for months on end,  in my opinion , to boast later about how stable it is, and how unstable Bitcoin is. Meanwhile all this drama around Bitcoin, because it really is the people's coin, with allegiance to no corporation. Make no mistake, if their corporate coin prevails, it will be used to enslave humanity, not make them free.

Just the fact that you have to ask a question like this, highlights the total disregard of Bitcoin users interests from the S2X Camp. Is this an actionable claim against those that are forcing this action? That remains to be determined because that NYA that they became signatories to, may just be all that's needed to demonstrate intent to disrupt the established existing protocol. I say this with all my knowledge that I am almost certain that if S2X hurts people financially, then there will perhaps be much to reconcile for later by the S2X Parties.

What is nonsense is the entire premise that somehow when it comes to Bitcoin mining, energy is wasted. The same can be said about any energy use, its basing the debate no on another's opinion that it's a waste. I may think your energy use to heat your home is a waste, because I'm not using it. You see where this goes?

Eth is bullet proof, it's not allowed volatility, and now that the Banker 2x coup has failed, now eth will get pumped again.

Eth= Bankers Choice/ Bitcoin= Bankers Scorn.

Gee, Pension Funds built Las Vegas, and got a nice return. You got all this pension money invested in BS Corporate Stawks, with book cooking on Steroids, Ceo's blowing money like stuff thru a goose, sub prime garbage auto/home loans, etc., etc,. and the market is at record highs, yet all these States with sinking pension investments, where's that money going? What kinds of fees have the States been shelling out for that Garbage? Bitcoin is the Blue Chip of crypto, you know how I can tell? By the History of lives it has improved, not a history of scams like ICO PumpADumps,  etc. I don't want to hear about Mount Gox either, that's not a failure of Bitcoin, it's a failure of an exchange. I know there's gonna be staunch resistance to simple Bitcoin investment, cuz it cuts out the greedy 3 parties skimming every economic transaction known to mankind.

Thank you for the response, I had been wondering why or what possible motive some of the US exchanges had for supporting what 2X is doing, when they cast shade on Bch and Bgold, and that's kind of a big deal to tell everyone they're gonna decide who gets the branding. I found that to be an arrogant posture towards the customer. Similar to something a major bank chain would do. I couldn't understand why they would ever assume customers would want a Non-Core Bitcoin? I certainly don't.

In many aspects that's what is different about Bitcoin, it's marketing is all organic, there's no official Bitcoin advertising dept. or Public Relations staff. That's why people end up in subs looking for some input as to what's the latest in Bitcoin. Since it's not a tightly controlled Corp microphone, you gonna have different aspects brought forward. Compare it to ether, which my take is this, under the hood the engine and mechanicals not so good, but they have a marketing team working consistently to build a brand, meanwhile spouting off about their corporate love affairs, even though it's mostly fluff, to the casual observer, it sounds fantastical.
With Bitcoins marketing being organic, homegrown, the people here who counter the fake fud, are performing a valuable service to the Bitcoin brand, and I hope this continues full bore, and allow me to say thank you to all the helpful folks that decide to throw in their valuable knowledge. Thanks ��

You can easily tell which crypto is the real deal because Bitcoin is under constant attack, the others hang out in the sunshine, with no negative press. Even in the face of obvious ICO scamming, ether price barely fluctuates, no negative attacks, and now Vitalik goes on a road show, walking back the absolute junk he helped put in place. With no scathing critique like Bitcoin constantly receives. The point I take away from this fact is that Bitcoin is the 'REAL DISRUPTER' Of the untrusted systems, and some of the others are decoys.

If you take the time to study the Central Bank in the USA, you would undoubtedly discover that they're not just going to allow themselves to be peacefully and quietly usurped by competition. Read about Sen Louis McFadden, who took on the bank during the depression era, read some of his remarks on the house floor, read about the documented attempts to take his life, and then perhaps you'll have a clearer understanding of just how serious these people are about protecting their 'captured' market. Rockefeller once said, 'competition is sin' , and I'm sure it wasn't out of context. Don't allow yourself to be dragged in to these skirmishes about other crypto, China bans, and all the other FUD, cause it's going to happen. Some legit concerns, some not. Only try to concern yourself with those things that you control, not the things you don't.

The bottom line is this, you like to say Hodl? I'm good with that. You like to serve Kool Aid? I'm good with that. Why would anyone get emotional about someone else's position on Bitcoin? You want to short it? Go ahead, that's one option. You going long? That's another option.
What is Bitcoin gonna do today or tomorrow? It will either be there, or it won't.
The same is true for any investment, any. While we're on this side of the grass, we can make choices, some good, maybe some not so good, it depends on who's doing the measuring.
One thing that's obvious with the small float of Bitcoin is that if majority of owners buy and hold, it's hard to swing down the value because there isn't many selling.
This will be more evident as true, no exchange, peer to peer transactions become easier to facilitate. For instance, an exchange says today's market price is $????, But the peer to peer shows $?????, so if I need to swap, where am I going to swap? El Cheapo exchange price, or Fat City peer to peer?
Power hungry are looking for ways to tame this tiger called Bitcoin, and I don't see it happening, it's kind of like roping the wind. Anyway, it's all good.

If you got in at a good low price, it's sometimes helpful to cash out your initial investment, and then play with house money. This will give you a stronger hand to wait out the storms. This is Not advice, just an opinion, everyone has to do what's right in their own situation. There also may be a good chance of some favorable tax legislation in the USA, to encourage cryptomarkets. The same was done for internet commerce back in the day.
Remember, China is not the prominent leader of Bitcoin markets anymore, and not mining either. I've seen big changes in the Bitcoin ecosystem since watching in 2013. Just be prepared for big dips, cause it surely can happen, this doesn't have a big float, and when the buying action is quiet, the sellers can easily move it down.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:41:09

There in lies the problem. When the Fed meets in private, the consensus they agree on does not include people from different walks of life, and also doesn't include people's elected Representatives. A semi or fully private Banking Cartel was not included in the documents that founded this nation, nor was it intended to. When Andrew Jackson ran the Private Banks out, America experienced an era of unprecedented prosperity, this is all historical record. Again, when these Bankers meet up, the only voices they hear are their own, and this should not be. I agree they don't want to be influenced by politics, at least admittedly so, but they're humans, and they are influenced by outside forces, everyone is. If they were doing such a good job, then why are there so many wars, and fights, and displays of greater and faster ways to destroy other people? I realize they probably don't assume responsibility for these things, but when you control the capital flows, how can you feign ignorance of what's going on? Why does the Fed allow certain businesses to be considered too big to fail? That's the type of rigged game I'm referring to, the one they've allowed to be created where bad decisions have good outcomes via bail out, but others can just twist in the wind. Thank goodness for the Core developers, who carry on the mission  of keeping the exit door open, because to me, that is what Bitcoin is, an exit door from a rigged game.

I can see where most of this is accurate, except the part where some of these detractors are probably supported by Central Banks because everyone has a price? We have no idea what kind of alliance these people have struck in private, all we can really go by is their actions, and it appears alot of what they're doing does look to be a negative to Bitcoin value. I count ether and ripple in the mix as well, because it's fairly obvious that they receive support from an unseen hand. I mean c'mon, all the bugs and insecurity, and lack of decentralization, and these 2 Crypto's still maintain their  and  spot on the chart? That's more than just marketing, that's being propped up by an unseen hand. Why? I think the logic here is simple, Bitcoin is really the money for the people, so let's inject a couple fake people's crypto in the mix, maybe in the long run we can convince them to switch to the crypto the Central Banks can subvert and control. Based on true stories of Ethereum missteps, the token doesn't even drop below 200? What about their announcement about POS? A Total rigged system and no mining reward? Still it holds  cap value? I call BS on that for sure. They even used ether to stake Tezos, whose claim to fame is to do exactly what ether already does, and the price doesn't drop? Yep, there's alot of shade being thrown on Bitcoin, but as we see, Money Badger don't care.

Excuse me I had to step away for a few minutes, I see you agree Bitcoin has some value, but I have to point out that one of the most compelling features of Bitcoin is not just moving wealth back and forth cheap, but the fact that it's Permission less, and doesn't require approval by 3rd parties that want to exercise control freak power over everyone else. I like Bitcoin because of what Obama said, you can carry your own Swiss Bank in your pocket. When Swift system tried to block transactions of people they disagree with, I found that to be extreme overreach of their power to abuse the market place. To become Sovereign ourselves, will usher in an age of freedom and creativity to benefit all of us. 
I cannot comprehend though why you defend the Federal Reserve with such vigor, some of the systems they have set in place are ridiculous in their usurpations of people's freedom, and the more you gaze at the economic picture they paint for average Americans, the more crooked and rigged it becomes. The Fed isn't controlling inflation at all, the metrics have  been changed to alter official numbers to even count inflation and employment, and this has been widely covered. I could go on and on with examples, but really what's the point? You seem intelligent enough to already know what's going on, unless you're willfully ignorant of it. I do not presume anything about you, perhaps your a banker yourself, perhaps the system serves everything you need, I don't see it that way, I think these rigged systems are wholesale ripping hard working people off everyday, and I hope they can all find wealth and happiness thru Bitcoin.

It seemed like the Buzz that was Bitcoin has kind of fizzled a little (is that poetry?) in the past couple weeks, kind of like a soda loosing some if it's Fizz. I think alot of FOMO money was rushing in up to 5000, and then when a big profit taking took place, new adopters slammed on the brakes thinking , gee I could lose money here. Several mainstream negative vibe articles got circulated, and voila, here we are at low 4000.  The problem with FOMO money is when they don't see this paying off quickly, like a slot machine, and then actually see drastic moves to the downside, then you have FOLE (fear of Losing Everything) kick in, which is completely understandable.

Yes, and just get used to the idea that there's no such idea as a free market. Crypto is pegged to the price in Fiat currency, therefore it's subject to manipulation by Fiat. One Bitcoin is, and will always be One Bitcoin.
This is critical to commit this to memory when you see the Fiat price swings, Bitcoin CANNOT be counterfeited, it's record is immutable. When the Fiat printing presses collapse under the weight of Oath breaking and rampant fraud, and geo-political chicanery, Bitcoin will remain, with Zero debt issuance, up to the point of 21 million Bitcoin.

TBH, I never expected to debate someone on a Bitcoin Reddit sub, about the truth of Central Banking, and how they've managed to become the most powerful institution in the World, unelected, and accountable to no one. I have to ask you, do you believe Bitcoin to be a valid replacement for Central Banks? Do you believe that a Public, DeCentralized Ledger makes the World more honest and open, or are you in the camp that enjoys having your economic fate determined by Bankers in a back room, that pick all the winner's and loser's?

Yes for E-Mail, in fact I expect once cash is dispensed of, maybe sooner, we will see Google and the other big e-mailers charge for their services. Of course what I read the other day about Josh Browns trip down the rabbit hole of Bitcoin, Lightning transactions on the side chain will very much become the defacto method of fast transactions. Josh mentioned further that instead of protocols that don't earn, in the case of Bitcoin, the value of Bitcoin will be immense, and the ancillary services that run beside it will have a smaller slice of the pie. This would explain Google and Branson's investment in wallet technology.

I agree, the exchanges operate partially like a bank, except they don't want to take any responsibility for the product their facilitating and providing storage of same. The similar business model most certainly is a securities brokerage, because like a stock product, there are material changes that occur to crypto, that can alter it's value, beyond just what the second to second price determines. These changes, like a fork, is something being programmed by people, not some imaginary force. From what I see in this space, are exchanges that want to act like a NASDAQ of crypto, and reap huge reward for their business, but they want to punt any liability for the position they chose to be in.

Don't assume that just because the Central Bank is backstopping the Dow and NASDAQ, that they're somehow smarter than you or I, or even luckier. It's a completely rigged game, and like all games, at some point, it's gonna stop. With the amount of treachery and the breaking of social contracts, that day is not far away. Look at what Equifax just did? How about the expensive Govt agencies that are supposed to watch them? You can see where this system is headed.

Not your key, not your coin. I have heard that over and over, and I understand the reason for part of it, but I don't buy the argument where Exchanges are concerned. They chose to be in the business of an exchange of product for deposit of money. It would be the same if you owned shares of company X and when the stock split or distributed shares of a spin-off, Your broker informs you that you have nothing, that wouldn't seem right would it? There is zero reason that an exchange cannot credit a specific Bitcoin to a customer's account, they sure seem to give it an identifier when moving it around. The notion that they can't do this or that is just a half baked excuse for not doing the work of being a professional exchange, that can properly and efficiently handle the clients business. Where are the   Prefork BCash from the exchanges? Have the they been sold at the ATH? Who is holding the money? The exchanges are bringing themselves litigation like they've never seen, and it's not going to end well for some of them.

Go back in time to 2016, and watch the interview with Chandler Guo, Bitcoin Miner. Chandler made the remark concerning Bitcoin then, which was 700.00 , he said at the conference Everyone was talking about making a new coin, and I recall Chandler saying, you don't need a new coin, and as for Bitcoin he said you only need to buy one. Just one enough. He also talked about the other coins being like son of Bitcoin, and so on. Chandler is an exceptional forward thinker.

Sorry, I'll have to disagree with part of what you said. The exchanges most certainly make a 'market' for certain crypto, and therefore have some control over what happens between the time they accept Fiat, place and fill orders for crypto, etc. To say Bitcoin is not controlled by exchanges is not true. At different points it most certainly is. In fact,  the examples you cited in the first part of your response clearly demonstrate that they do have Control,.albeit those examples demonstrate control through negligence.

I agree with you on draw, but I think it's going to move up regardless, because of what it is right now. Yes, it's nice to have it improve, but I don't see it as essential. The math behind it makes it so. I've said before and again, In a World of Oath Breakers, Bitcoin is trustless and permission less. That's why IMHO, It's worth so much more than these insider controlled fake Blockchain databases. That's the reason MIT is using it for it's certifications, which is a HUGE endorsement btw.

I agree, this point of view is from a position of being one of the hamsters on the wheel, chasing the chunk of cheese, that always seems out of reach. I'm not trying to be rude, I find my circumstances the same. It takes transcendental thinking to see things the way the power brokers do. When thinking in terms of Government power, it's virtually the same as the Central Bank, they don't lose any money either on anything, they are the force multiplier of the Central Bank, and thus it matters not how many pieces of Fiat they receive for BTC. It's a stark reminder to all of us, that they are truly on another level. What is reality? Increasingly it's what they tell you it is.

One thing these Princes are not, is stupid. I believe him when he says he doesn't understand it, because I at first didn't either.

Someone posted a long time ago, I believe when BTC was about 700.00, that there were different types of Investors that would enter and exit Bitcoin at different points. Basically what this person pointed out, was that some 3 digit buyers would bow out when it hit 4 digits, and be happy. Some would enter at 4 digits and leave at upper 4 to 5, apparently thinking that's it. Then he said that people that already know and have wealth would hold on longer till Bitcoin prices reflect it's special reserve status. I am of the camp that believes that there may be a problem concerning a too early exit, and may prevent re-entry at a comfortable price point. The coin you sell today, may be the coin you never have again. In fact, the notion of whole coin ownership, I believe will possibly become a rich man's market, just like Berk A is today.

One thing I always remember when it comes to investment risk,  Figures don't Lie, but Liars can figure. That said, Bitcoins  is an immutable public ledger, trustless, and as many know, the same cannot be said of many investments people consider secure. I don't share their optimism.

Look at the valuation of Amazon, they don't pay any dividends.

The money return in stocks, unless it pays a dividend, is coming from speculation in the market, that someone is willing to pay more for the share ownership than you did. This is the same as many other investment, even precious metals that you keep at hand, you buy it in the hope that someone, someday will give you other and hopefully more value for it.
