Oh ok, gotcha. Thanks for clearing that up!

This is awesome!

Wait, I thought a month ago on this sub everyone was against Segwit2x. Is this Segwit2x different? If someone would be willing to clue me in on what Segwit is and why it's desirable that'd be cool.

I'm glad I bought more BTC a couple days ago at $5,800/BTC. I figured I would lose some money since I was buying it at a high price. Glad I did though.

EDIT: sorry m8, that was uncalled for. Had a terrible day at work. We bitcoiners are in this together.

I moved mine to an app called Bitpay (Android) since I just have a phone.

Wait, I was told earlier to move my BTC to a wallet instead of holding them in Coinbase. With this news, should I move them back on Coinbase to get some B2X?

Noob here, does HODL just mean holding onto your BTC?

I'm a complete noob to Bitcoin, and just downloaded the coinbase app on my phone and bought some BTC. Why exactly is Coinbase warned against on this subreddit? Where should I be starting? Like I said, I have very little knowledge regarding BTC.

What movie is this?
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:19:08
Thank you for the info. I downloaded Bitpay on my phone and will transfer my BTC to there from Coinbase.

I'm aware of the toggle which switches between buying/selling BTC, but I've made purchases with BTC which subtract from my total BTC amount without me making any profit. Whereas selling BTC I would make some fiat. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:53:39
Awesome app! Thank you! Any way you could add an option to record purchases made with BTC?

I entered 0 fiat, that seems to be what I'm looking for, thanks!
