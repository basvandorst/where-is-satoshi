You are an idiot. Bitcoin stores every transaction in a public ledger. It is the worst crypto currency for criminals.

South Koreans 
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:51:24
Yes 100% scam
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:15:29
We are waiting for a proper dip. Sub 3000 USD by end of April my prediction.
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:48:15
Somebody already embedded a virus signature on the blockchain. People are dicks unfortunately.

You are a fuckings moron if you use lended money for bitcoin. It might go back to 6k tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-21 13:14:53
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:44:57
Under 10k now on GDAX!

That is the point when it is so volatile you don't need to hit absolute bottoms or peaks. You will still gain. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:14:41
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:53:10
Good for ya!
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:54:42
If you sell now and buy at the dip you get more BTC for your money.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:28:43
6k in 7 days. I am afraid.
@_date: 2018-02-22 11:48:25
Remember to spit in your googles to avoid fogging.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:47:58
People here are mostly common idiots. They are the people who sell at bottom and buy at ATH.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:14:34
I prefer the finger in the air method. But seriously this rapid growth is unhealthy. The day Tether topples it is going to get ugly.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:53:13
What Crash? Btc up on GDAX 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:24:42
This guy predicted the crash two weeks ago down to 6k USD, in January! ... 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:30:40
They are safe on coinbase keep them there until you full understand wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:09:17
We have to make a double bottom before the moon. Expect 7k USD within a week.
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:53:01
6k next
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:59:06
Thanks here is an interesting proposition: 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:21:00
Back to Bear: 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:52:15
They are going to sell.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:10:09
Watch and learn 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:24:09


The BTC will still be on the blockchain. But they will be unusuable without the private key. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:56:51
There is only 2 weeks since BTC was below 7k USD. Sell now and buy back cheaper in a couple of days.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:09:56
Into the Abyss!
