This is a documentary I would definitely watch

Yeah, the latter is recommended because then you're in control. An exchange can be susceptible to hacks, shut downs, etc so people try to leave their money on their as little as necessary.
Coinbase at least is pretty safe but you never know.
Having your own wallet comes with its own vulnerabilities but those are ones that are in your control.

Yeah, I definitely wish me and my friend had more foresight before trying it out. For some reason the site is currently down, but it's really interesting to look at all the statistics on our accounts when it is up.
Thanks by the way, making the bot was where all the fun was. I suppose it was nice while we were winning as well haha. Some of our bets would jump to what would now be crazy amounts. 1.8 bitcoins on one which I personally would never risk nowadays.
Poker would be far more complicated... not to mention I don't even really know how to play. The nice thing about this one was all you had to do was crawl a webpage and figure out whether it was a win or a loss and adjust accordingly. I don't even know where I would start with a poker one... probably with a book on poker haha

But... What about the electricity fees? I mean I enjoy mining for fun too but there seems to be a fee no matter what method you obtain them with

My friend and I lost about 7 bitcoins a year ago after we created a program to automatically use Martingale for us on 
We learned the hard way that gambling is bad

Is coinbase back to giving bitcoins quickly? I haven't bought in a while but I remember when people were complaining about waiting weeks to receive their bitcoins
@_date: 2013-06-09 19:31:00
Yeah, I can see it still taking a few days for the money to transfer, etc. But that's good to hear. I've been needing to buy more

Yeah, I guess it goes both ways. Never really thought about it that way.

On vacation so I can't find the old address I used since I don't have my computer on me but I hope this address I just got on my mobile phone works fine:  1Q4c58RgUBxFBsLXJbvMN61LcQrpR4bZSv

Thanks! I guess I'll have to look into it. It would definitely be something interesting to experiment with
@_date: 2013-07-07 17:14:27
Thanks! I really love the site, and not just because I actually won money when I played but because the design is so fun.

I know that all too well. A month ago a friend of mine built a double down program for  and we used it on my account to test (I had a linux virtual machine and it worked with the terminal's bitcoind program). Plus he had already lost his bitcoins from manually attempting to double down. After some long losing streaks I lost all 3 bitcoins of my initial investment. So yeah, props for coming out on top. It's nice to see someone beat the house haha

I've been around for a year. The instability is what brings me in. And I'm still at a net profit. But with recent happenings I just haven't been spending like I used to is all

That's a fair point I had forgotten. To speed up the process one could always buy with the btc they have and purchase more immediately following that so they don't have to wait for the bitcoins to come in to make the purchase
