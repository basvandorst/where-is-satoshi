Thanks for the info.
Isn't matching the production of a nuclear power plant overkill? Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't these plants operate under conditions assuming they need to cover average peak usage instead of actual usage? I was told one of the advantages of solar combined with battery is that it can accommodate demand in real-time and be decentralized across many buildings, creating sort of an Internet for energy.
The average US home needs a production of 1,187 Wh (much higher than international average) each day. With your estimate of solar production this means a person in the US needs about 12-15 square meters of solar panels and an effective energy storage system to cover their energy needs. From what I've seen, to cover this a setup, it would cost about $10k for the panels and another $9k for the battery setup. In the past 10 years alone we've seen the cost of solar modules go down 80%.
Even if we're generous, isn't it far more likely that in 30 years we'll see another reduction of price by least another 80%? If so, this would put the very same solar setup at around $4k. This is assuming that there are no major battery/solar breakthroughs and it continues along the average 6% price reduction that it has had for the past 30 years.
I'm not an expert so please excuse my ignorance. I find this topic fascinating.

Will solar cell + battery storage costs and efficiencies make fusion irrelevant by the time it comes out? ITER not expected until 2050. That's a significant amount of time for existing alternative energy systems to expand, innovate and optimize. I have a hard time believing that solar and wind won't dominate the world by the time we see a viable fusion reactor. I'm not an expert, what am I missing?
