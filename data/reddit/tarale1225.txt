It's risky, Bitcoin can go to 6k again or it could go on a moon mission. But historically, bitcoin has always rallied after crashing so I do believe we will see new highs, how high, I can't say. But all in all, please don't spend more than you can afford to lose.

that's good advice, I lost alot of money as well here and there, but could have gain some here and there too, I actually sold some during the dip to try and not look at my portfolio, but now all I can think of is how much potential money I missed and I lost with BTC going up lol
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:02:02
it'll go back up, but it's hard to predict when
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:47:34

@_date: 2018-02-21 22:03:13
So if I sent 2500 BTC, it would go through now? I remember BTC was slow in the former year

Same, i've been in bitcoin for a long-time. I've seen the highs and lows, and have faith that this project will grow to something amazing

haha true true, I never expected a 1k dip in a single day like this tho, it fell through 3 support levels and its still dropping
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:02:30
