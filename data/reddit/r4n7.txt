Cloudmining? (I mean the real one)
It is all about risk management, these type of contracts give them guaranteed profit every day!
For average person I would never recommend these services if you have internet and time, you can do huge research about anything in 5 min.

Bitcoin dropped by some % these days so...
Quiet pricey is both good and bad for investment.

Rip... his reputation
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:43:17
Umm it’s 50/50.
From first sight it is fine service, everything works and can gain some profits BUT after you realise how actually it works, your personal risks on paper, control options which is limited for you... you might see it as not worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:30:22
If my friend is using phone to mine. What will be comparison for gold? :D
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:18:59
True, especially in this price dancing moment
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:21
Go deep in the dip so next dip will be deep ;)

Money is nothing if you can’t spend them.

At least -300$ is expecting
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:27:14
because lambo is expensive

Same but after doubling I’m withdrawing starting capital +1$. So no matter what I am with profit :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:58:30
Don’t tell. They will insult you to take cash it out of bitcoin. You won’t do this ofc
Then theoretically bitcoin drops to 5k, for whole life they will abuse you bcs of this imo
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:32:08
Starting dec 27+
So better sell it on dec 30

There is always manipulation. You just dance around it trying to scalp some profits or HODL and don’t care.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:24:13
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:52
Technically yes. 
If you ever consider to leave, wait for first grow and sell. Because market almost never just fly down, it bounces down.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:53
Heh. When market grows people call it investment, when dips - gamble :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:43:47
