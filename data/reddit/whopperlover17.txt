I mean it’s up 50%, more than most of the top 10 coins. I’m not saying anything but there was opportunity there for some $$

1. The downvotes.
2. They got HACKED, huge difference. On top of that, they’re paying everyone back. Payments already started. This has never ever been an accusation made against them except for you pulling this information out of your ass. Try better next time. Better yet, don’t post untruthful information, it’s not cool.
