Sure let's 51% attack the DB that has your identity. Or waste energy on application's where it's not necessary.

Robinhood does charge a commission. 
Check to see the price they show and then click buy. Same with the sell, check the price and then click sell.

It says it in the chart up at the top January 23rd 2019. It is outdated

It might. Don't use absolutes on investments, because that's when you will panic sell.

It's called recession, not regression... Regression is a stat technique.
Nobody could predict when it starts. If you're so sure, you should short the market and real estate.

They're just hiding their commission. If the buy limit is 11000, they won't buy it for you until it drops to 10980. 
So they are still getting the commission when it happens and you're not getting your bitcoin if it never gets to 10980.
You could do the same at coinbase (pro). Put your limit order at 10980 instead of 11000 and you get your same bitcoin and they get their commission (which is less on limit orders). 
Do the test. Buy 10 dollars worth of btc in robinhood and sell it right away. Even if the price doesn't change you instantly lost about 1% of your money. 
I hope this makes sense, I'm just trying to help.
