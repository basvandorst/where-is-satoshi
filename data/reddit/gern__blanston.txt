So you are saying that people make investments to not make money? Not saying you should go against your morals to make money at all, just that making more money is better than making less money, all else equal 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:06:23
One post is from 3 days ago. And to try to bury this stuff is ridiculous, people should know what has happened and should obviously avoid this exchange like the plague. Saying you should hide bad news when people are losing thousands of dollars is so shitty of you
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:11:37
In the US the exchanges are subject to bank regulations, thats what i was referring to. Specifically "know your customer" laws, basically laws against money laundering. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:33:15
No comment on the bullshit you are saying, just wanted to say that you seem like an amazing asshole
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:25:59
Haha yea I definitely said that. What the hell are you talking about? We are talking about investments, I said you should make investments that make you more money than less, nothing more  
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:47:11
Haha again, I did not bring up oil or compare it to bitcoin in any way. And cryptocurrencies are being manipulated more than any stable currency, its become a joke. And unless you are actually promoting the development of a crypto, you're not doing anything or adding any sort of value, you're just making the system less stable by speculating and driving up the price.
And you keep saying all I care about is making money, I really love the weird assumptions you are making here. And all Americans and Europeans have a narrow world view? Huh?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:19:53
Well most people don't really pay attention, but a whole lot of people, myself included, are not at all fine with it 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:52:50
Yes by saying to invest in profitable things I definitely meant become a criminal and get into child sex trafficking, good call. And yes, you are right, people who bought in early are making a ton of money, thats how pyramid schemes work. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:11:13
No I think bitcoin cash is really dumb as well, although the quicker and cheaper transaction fees do make it more appealing than bitcoin. But outside of that, its the exact same thing, which is still deflationary and non-functional as a currency or store of value
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:13:26
And holy shit, I just read that link, and bitcoin already uses 1/3 of the energy of the entire global financial system?? And its only going to get less efficient as mining gets more difficult. Thats fucking insane, and it does nothing. I really had no idea it was this bad, holy crap this is dumb. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:42:49
Well it is going to that person, since they froze the account. I am sure its just the procedure of the bank/laws in your state or whatever. They aren't just freezing it to make her mad, the intent is to take the money I am sure. It sounds like your girlfriend needs to understand more about this judgement and how it is being executed, because you clearly don't know the full story. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:04:20
He moved that shit on public wifi? At an airport lounge? What the fuck??
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:12:47
Read what you said above, its complete nonsense. What use does bitcoin have other than speculation? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:25:56
Yea this is insane. Risk is much lower than accepting credit card payment hahaha. Pure delusion here 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:08:00
What? No money isn't created by printing it, its by lending. That last sentence is nonsense. I still dont see in any possible way how bitcoin even could do any of that stuff, even if hypothetically the us government accepted bitcoin for taxes, nothing else would change 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:33:56
Oh its basically a ponzi scheme at this point. And the tech is interesting and has worth, just not in this application 
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:18:07
0 points by the way. And you never responded to my last post, no backbone huh 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:16:48
Well I obviously can't give you any advice, you're the greatest investor in the world from what I can tell 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:41:19
That doesn't mean much coming from a guy who just said a deflationary currency would be beneficial 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:57:03


What the fuck does this mean? Your entire response is complete nonsense. There is no purpose or future and it is a shit technology 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:44:08
This sounds like a problem of miscommunication then, your girlfriend needs to talk with the bank to try to find out what the restriction is and why, there is clearly a lot more to it
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:05:03
It doesnt use as much electricity as the banking system, thats your argument? It does literally .0000000000001% of what the banking system does, how is that a comparison? 
And coal actually powers teslas in most places, thats where your electricity comes from. Now some is shifting to natural gas, but its still mostly from coal. 
And to say that the oil business hasn't gotten more efficient is laughable, its one of the most competitive and biggest businesses in the world. Look what has happened in the last 20 years with horizontal drilling, the technology is pretty awesome. 
I didn't try to compare bitcoin to oil or whatever is happening here, oil was mentioned by someone else and I responded. Bitcoin is useless though 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:10:14
Yea I am in the US, so cards are ubiquitous. And yes I think internet cash is a really neat concept, thats why I am so interested in bitcoin and other cryptos. Are you restricted from wiring money where you want to? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:59:07
Yea hes a really talented banjo player, has done a couple of tours where they just play music and he hardly even talks. I will check out Just for Laughs, thanks for the tip. 
By the way here is the Gern Blanston bit, it was from one of his biggest albums so I bet you did hear it at some point 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:48:28
Haha you think Warren Buffett is a trader? Jesus Christ you people
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:20:05
Haha no, im just jerking off with lotion while laughing at you guys fucking pies 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:27:19
And how on earth does this mean all I care about is money? I've been following bitcoin from pretty much the beginning, if I were that into getting rich quick I would have invested a million times. I don't because it's wrong, in my opinion, and insanely irrational. I don't think people are rational, but this market is absolutely not. If you mean that all I care about is money in terms of financial investments, then you're absolutely right. Obviously assuming it's all legal and moral or whatever. I just buy index funds instead of gambling on bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:45:04
Haha you really think a vote matters? I don't give enough of a shit about it to go fight some unwinnable fight. I'm in the best country in the world as a whole, literally no better option. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:48:13
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:31:06
You realize this is a complete joke that is actually intended to mock bitcoin, right? Click on the link, its a bucket with a constantly changing price and copy that makes fun of bitcoin. Lovely news indeed, right?
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:25:32
They probably aren't, just like a lot of the recipients of money from this fund. This is one of the most poorly thought out charity schemes I have ever heard of, and this guy has wasted millions of dollars. He even paid a $1100 fee to make one transfer haha. And gave away money based on comments on the first post he made without any sort of research whatsoever. Such an amazing waste of potential
Edit: I can't spell
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:16:52
Volatility is something that can be measured very simply. Bitcoin is one of the most volatile assets ever, and the USD is one of, if not the, steadiest currencies in the world. They are not even on the same planet as far as volatility is concerned. And crypto is a whole lot less mysterious than dollars? Thats because you clearly don't understand anything about money and what it is and how it works. 
Edit - Erroneous question mark 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:10:46
is amazing. Its mostly pointing out insane and ridiculous things bitcoin people say, but is actually the most honest discussion of bitcoin on reddit. Definitely check it out 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:55:52
Well I don't, I just used bitcoin as an example because it's far and away the largest by both number of "users" and amount of activity. But the same thing applies to other cryptos as well. So instead of just trying to insult me, maybe answer my question?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:06:54
HAh so just the novelty, got it 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:28:13
The only deception and manipulation is highlighting the limited number of coins as a positive thing. You're just trying to recruit more bag holders to make a buck off of, thats deception and manipulation 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:45:46
Yea I missed the VPN part, but I would think even establishing a connection to the public wifi could be problematic. But I really have no idea, have just been spooked about even logging into websites on public wifi 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:34:06
0 of those were funny 
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:45:03
Because its fascinating. Have you ever seen this many people get misled and buy into something so meaningless? Its a natural ponzi scheme crossed with a cult, and like both of those things its filled with idiots. Economically the whole thing is very interesting and I have been following it closely since the price was in cents. Just unfathomable to me where we are with this speculative mania 
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:02:36
Yea they more than any publication/website would pump bitcoin articles for clicks. They are the worst
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:35:36
Haha keep thinking that, I am sure your coworkers think you are very smart and not at all annoying 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:15:27
Or invest in things that will make you money? To not invest in anything related to oil because of potential future sources of energy is silly. And most everyone here is just here to make a quick buck, the number of bitcoin owners who "fundamentally believe" in bitcoin is very, very small 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:42:07
Thats a lot of imagining based on nothing, pure guesswork 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:44:11
This is just silly nonsense 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:55:21
Well how "should be ok" are we talking? Would you move, say, $100 million like that? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:56:08
For the novelty? Or do you want to own it because its worth a lot of money?
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:46:31
Yea but so much so that we can never mine all of it, and the rate at which we pull it out of the earth will remain relatively stable over time. Bitcoin won't 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:24:35
Haha I didn't even bring up oil. And I have good conversations here all the time, and understand bitcoin better than most people who are invested in it. You're just not responding to anything I am actually saying that is contrary to bitcoin and ignoring it all, like a proper bitcoiner 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:05:23
Well theres only so much you can do to actually affect it, pretty much nothing. You can do things to protect yourself from being tracked and all that, to a point, which a lot of people are very aware of and do. But yea, theres not really much you can do about it as a normal person. So you have no option than to have it both ways 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:27:15
Oh good point, that makes sense 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:14:59
Ah crap, I had blocked out the whole afternoon and made a pot of coffee 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:34:53
Not correct
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:25:59
And ~~miss~~ now you have the exchanges questioning what you're doing with your money with the exact same kyc laws. So less experienced and effective people doing the same job, not good 
Edit - Typo, stupid swype

Haha what the hell is sports ball?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:16:56
She should have paid it off before the company went through the courts to have her account frozen. I assume they are going to take her money now to pay the debt, so thats how she pays it at this point. If she were responsible and did not let it get to this extreme, ridiculous point, then she could have just written a check, used cash or whatever the hell she wanted. But since they got a judgement and took control of her account, that is no longer her money until she gets it cleared up. And by the way, I can't just walk into a bank and have your account frozen and funds locked, I would have to have a judgement from a court or something similar, you make it sound like the bank just arbitrarily did it to be mean, when its really all your girlfriend's fault for being irresponsible. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:27:37
Yea that is an interesting way to look at, just a test of this type of system and how it might work in practice.  My banking experience has been different, I dont pay any fees and in fact make money with points etc., but I know thats not everyone's experience. And ATMS, Venmo and the like really make all my use cases for cash very easy. But again, I know thats not everyone's experience 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:48:14
Old Steve Martin joke from his stand up days, I dont think anyone really gets it at all haha. I had one person recognize it one time, but it was from a graphic novel or something they read where they were also using it also as a Steve Martin reference. But if you haven't seen it, his old stand up was hysterical, his style was very unique and he is one of the funniest comics ever, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:24:55
Haha wow, I haven't seen this many buzzwords in one paragraph since business school. Most everything you said is nonsense. The dollar is not literally cloth paper, actually only a small percentage of dollars in existence is printed on paper. And how on earth do cryptocurrencies reflect reality more than dollars? What does that even mean? And you know currencies aren't intended to appreciate, right? That is a horrible quality of one. A war tool? What the fuck?
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:00:45
I meant that it grows at a predictable rate, not that we know how much gold there is. Bitcoin is deflationary, the opposite of gold given the supply expansion. And bitcoin is going to magically get rid of taxes and government control? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:53:48
The only reason, there is literally no driver of demand other than traders
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:07:48
Hah yes you give yourself an out with "almost". Just spreading bullshit to hype up the price, its pathetic 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:31:26
This comment is really confusing, I have no idea what you are trying to say 
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:37:12
 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:23:05
I meant because we were talking about financial investments, then you randomly bring up having kids out of nowhere. Personally I have no interest in kids, but that's a personal decision. Honestly I wouldn't ever consider that an investment though. Yea, you invest time, money and all that, obviously, but I would never think of that in the same vein as buying stocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:10:03
So you have no idea what Buffett or Berkshire Hathaway do, or how the stock market works. Is that right? And you call people "money worshippers" when you are involved in a get rich quick scheme. Like he said, thats not going to end well 
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:35:14
Haha yes this is definitely how you should think about investments
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:36:17
I didn't mean this one specifically, but a lot of the donations have been very suspect. And regardless, the hastiness and lack of organization of this whole thing has left millions on the table and done much less good than it could have
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:54:00
I meant to say crypto, meaning the ecosystem.
And saying that about Americans is a pretty narrow view there as well 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:18:22
So the value is for actual users, so none? No one is using bitcoin except to speculate with it, so its actual value, if based on its number of users, is basically 0. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:42:23
Hah really? What else are people buying bitcoin for, other than to make money? It's not useable as a currency, it's not any sort of digital gold or store of value like people are trying to sell it as now, its only use is as a means of speculation
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:50:34
But it stops growing eventually, thats not the case with gold. Bitcoin in deflationary, gold grows in supply every year at a very predictable rate, they are opposites in that case 
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:53:36
Well she legally owed it to another party it sounds like, who probably went through the courts to collect it. So you would rather live in a world with unenforceable laws/judgement and terrible banking services then by mildly inconvenienced in a situation that sounds like it was her own fault? 
edit: Said word twice
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:07:53
Thats why deflationary currencies are idiotic and bitcoin can never, ever succeed as any form of currency
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:27:00
Because that's what you had, and no one uses the Zimbabwe currency, just like no one actually uses bitcoin for anything other than speculation
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:03:29
Hah what is this, the old testament? Its the free market, interest rates are interest rates. I love how bitcoin people think debt is the worst thing ever no matter the type, use or reason, even though its what makes the world go round 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:54:47
No I didnt say that, I said I have been following it since the price was in cents. I got on the silk road and all that. Just never bought it because I never thought it was a good investment. And what about anger being bliss? I didnt say anything about anger
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:46:49
But crypto isn't useful to anyone except for speculation, that was my point. Just ironic he said that about an app relayed to crypto, something that is completely useless unless you're buying drugs
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:52:23
Good point, I've never heard of anyone making money in the oil business /s
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:51:12
Haha I didnt bring up oil, just the idea of dismissing it entirely because you heard about experiments being done is really stupid, which it is. And the whole thing about "social impact" and crypto and all that is nonsense, people are just in it to make a quick buck. And talk about an environmental impact, it uses an insane amount of electricity and produces literally nothing. Oil flies planes and powers cars. To compare the two is ridiculous hyperbole 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:43:50
Totally, thats why so many people are using it as money now, right? I mean, everywhere I go takes bitcoin and its easy and cheap to use and I wont lost half my money on the way to the grocery store, where I can definitely spend it. And its good bitcoin has taken us away from the darn banking system, its so frustrating having my money be safe and easily accessible. Everyone knows this, its so obvious /s
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:54:34
10% haircuts for the wealthy? What world are you living in? Take away the currency issuance from the fed, the government would still control us and surveil us, to think otherwise is insane. And why would the fed ever give up the issuance of currency? They would have to accept bitcoin for taxes, which they would literally never do. Its not scary for banks or "big gov" at all, no one is issuing their own money, they are just speculating on made up internet tokens that have no real use or purpose
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:04:02
No to use bitcoin someone would need to pay the $40 fee on top of the cost of the sandwich. And business license and hourly rate? I'm talking about the feasibility of bitcoin as a currency, which is what you said. It's completely non functional as a currency at this point, literally zero non-criminal use cases
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:52:45
Could literally never happen. Other than inflation, everything you listed would and could never happen in the US. Thats just insane ramblings. And yea, smaller countries with shitty governments have money problems, but over 90% of world contracts are drawn up in dollars, everything is done in dollars, and these things could and would never happen to dollars. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:06:05
Banking and fiat is a mass delusion? I think you have that confused with bitcoin, or you honestly dont understand how the economy works. 
Appreciation of a currency is horrible, a deflationary currency is completely non-functional. You understand that, right? And no one has to have a banking license to hold bitcoin, thats not a thing. Your whole post seems really delusional, are you just one of those conspiracy theorists? And how is the US dollar a day away from crashing at every moment? Thats insane and absolutely absurd 
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:02:38
So like 4 businesses? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:52:51
Yea, its definitely not the decades of market beating performance surpassing pretty much every other large investor in the world, not that at all 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:30:32
Oh yea, it was definitely a long standing bit of his. He also did one early on where he did the same set up, but instead of Gern Blanston he just made a goofy sound with his finger and lips. It was on another album as well. I need to go back and watch his late night appearances, too bad we didn't get more of his stand up over the years 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:35:28
Hah your argument is basically people use pets.com because they want to buy pet food easily. Most every use that people are trying to shoehorn blockchain into have no need or get no benefit of it or of having a coin, it's trying to apply one tech to things that don't need it at all
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:32:12
Yea this is pretty much bitcoin in a nutshell. Assholes who think they know everything preaching to each other about stuff they dont really know all that much about in the end
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:32:27
Its not even that, its entirely a joke. They are mocking bitcoin and people who invest in it, they arent actually selling a "bitcoin bucket" as in the link
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:19:45
Well that idea is ludicrous. There are very free things that could happen that would turn America into a third world country anytime soon, and they are all insanely unlikely. They would be right
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:51:06
Haha where? And why would you ever pay a $40 fee to buy a sandwich?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:14:01
But you only did that for the novelty presumably, it is never the easiest and best option to make a payment, ever. Slow, cumbersome and expensive, it makes zero cents. And 99.99% people are only using it for speculation, its undeniable. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:19:26
I already replied to the rest of the post. I have been following it for years, since the price was in cents. Have always found it interesting from an economic perspective, but that bitcoin is a very poor solution for a problem that isnt really there. But since the price went insane its been so entertaining reading bitcoin stuff, people are absolutely insane. The delusion is too entertaining to miss, its a lot of fun 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:11:37
 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:29:10
So constantly talking about bitcoin at every turn and bragging about how well you have done, trying to pressure other people into getting into it, now you feel dumb that their talk of it all being bullshit looks correct. I would be rubbing it in your face as well if I were them 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:53:38
This is the dumbest thing ever, who would ever care about having a "whole unit" of a currency or commodity or asset or whatever they are calling it this week? This is just silly and makes absolutely no point or sense. Maybe think about the utility bitcoin could potentially provide (not much) and the giant issues of it being deflationary. Having only 21 million coins ever is very, very dumb, and the reason why it would NEVER work as a currency
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:16:52
No, they operate on a fractional reserve system and go to the central bank if they need cash, like he just explained 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:30:38
I am sure its just a period of time they have to wait until they take it. Or they give her a period of time before they take it and close the account. But regardless, what they are doing is right and is entirely your girlfriends fault. She was irresponsible, and now shes paying the cost for her actions. She is using her money to pay the loan, just not voluntarily. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:31:04
You mean do I have faith in Visa to make transactions with? Of course. And I do see the potential in it, just not through bitcoin which is incredibly inefficient.

Go sport ball team! Play well and good! 
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:41:13
The deleting of posts related to this is hilarious, can't let the new bagholders know how insanely insecure this whole thing really is. Same thing with tether, you can't talk about that here at all even though its propping up the entire system and is likely a complete fraud 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:50:12
That's exactly what it is at this point, people buying in expecting to find a greater fool when they need it
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:30:59
Haha well those are the intended uses of these coins, but no one is actually using it or buying it except for speculators. If anything, blockchain solutions will only be superior to non-blockchain solutions in tiny, niche areas. Blockchain tech is wildly inefficient for almost all applications.  And all those things you say above are what people "want" them to do, they dont actually do those things at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:33:29
Dollars do not reflect the value of the goods they buy? What are you talking about? That current price levels are not consistent with inflation or something? Because thats not true at all and really can't be. To say that a deflationary currency would be beneficial to the world is insanely stupid and wrong, by any standard. You clearly don't know what you are talking about and are very far off from reality here. Good luck with your funbucks 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:12:31
Haha you have no idea, this is great. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:54:49
Got it, thats good to know, thanks 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:51:19
They are freezing her accounts to take the money, since she was so irresponsible and didn't pay back her loan or seemingly participate in the court proceedings, they now have the legal right to take that money to satisfy her debt. If you think this wont still exist if bitcoin becomes our currency, you're an idiot.

Hah anything remotely negative about bitcoin is somehow spreading misinformation. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it misinformation. And its true, over 99% of the activity on any "coin" out there right now is pure speculation. Honestly, what is the legitimate use case for bitcoin (or other crypto) outside of tiny, niche applications? Its inefficient and being shoehorned into everything for no reason at all. Yes, a lot of software developers might be using it, but they are doing so out of novelty for the most part. I mean, I can jerk off with an apple pie if I wanted to (according to the movie American Pie), but its a hell of a lot more efficient to just use lotion and a tissue. In most applications, crypto is the unnecessary pie that your dick has no reason to ever go inside, just like it is being forced into applications today

So you're a speculator like everyone. But why would anyone want to switch to bitcoin over current solutions for exchanging money, in 99% of situations? The volatility of it all is what makes it so poor for money exchange, and when combined with it being deflationary it really won't be functional. Then throw in how expensive and complicated it is to use, along with its inevitable neutering by regulation from governments around the world, what is left? Speculating is fine to gamble on, but I think betting on it long term is very short sighted

I just can't believe he did it on public airport wifi, that seems insane. I know bankers who literally aren't allowed to use public wifi at all with their work equipment, and this guy transferred that kind of money, on his own with public wifi?

@_date: 2018-01-12 20:42:22
Hah so bitcoin is stable all of a sudden? Really? And if that person converted their money into bitcoin for the purpose of using it as a story of value, and then the value then went up and down wildly and at random, then that did not accomplish what they were trying to do. They were wrong in that scenario, even though they made money doing it, just like most bitcoiners are today 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:29:15
I completely agree, its just so insane to read. The trading gurus are funny, but my favorite are the economists who suddenly understand the entire world financial system, the history and purpose of money and how they can recreate all of it in a better way with their magic tokens. Just so much delusion and deception, its constantly amazing to me. And they think they are right because of the price, thats the craziest part. But I think what you said at the end is what is happening, people are lying to themselves because they want the price to go up. Its just this hysteria that is causing reasonable people to be very, very unreasonable, and it has to come crashing down at some point soon

I dont think you understand, if they have seized her bank account thats not her money anymore. If I am reading this correctly, a company or bank or person got a judgement against her, and is using that to collect the debt from her bank account. She fucked up, badly, and now they are legally taking her money. Bitcoin could never change this feature of the legal system, unless you are evading taxes and breaking the law and hiding money from the govt and her collectors using bitcoin, which is about the only use for it at this point

Yes, I understand how buying and selling things works. But if my assertion of use cases is incorrect, what are they today other than speculation? Its not functional as a currency or means of money transfer (ie Pineapple fund paying $1100 for a simple transfer). Now its "new gold" but it has 0 properties of gold or any other store of value currently in use. Its just a giant speculation machine pumping up the price of something without any value or point.

I did give advice to him in his intiail post to hire an attorney, look into setting up a foundation or similar vehicle for tax purposes, and to take the time to look into the organizations he wants to give to so that he can make his money work in the most effective way. Im not here trying to push some particular charity, just effective and efficient giving. There are a lot of online resources and organizations that vet charities and other groups for legitimacy, efficiency and overall effectiveness. Thats how I would start to figure out where to give that kind of money, and the person running this pineapple fund is not doing any of that from what it appears.

@_date: 2014-03-05 23:44:00
Is that a joke? The internet is nothing like bitcoin. Thats like saying the internet offered a more expensive, less efficient and more difficult way to access information. Obviously it was only used by experts at first before it was introduced to consumers, but the benefit and advancement was immediately apparent to ANYONE who knew what it was and could use it, no matter their level of expertise. That is a horrible example.
Again I ask, what value does bitcoin provide? It can do certain things, but it does nothing better than our current options. It can function as a store of value, a sort of commoditized currency, but we have better options for that which are actually useful to people. Things like gold, they function as a store of value because those goods have actual use and will be in demand regardless of its use as a store of value. Our current commodity currencies also will continue to be produced and mined over time at a pretty predictable rate, which will allow it to maintain its value and expected supply over time so that there is no fear of real inflation or deflation. Bitcoin will stop being mined after 21 million, which will encourage hoarding, discourage use as a currency, and lead to deflation. That is a horrible charactaristic of something intended to function as a currency, as a means of exchange. 
So again, whats the point? What value can bitcoin provide today or in the future that is above and beyond what we already have in place?

You couldn't even give me a reason to use it. Bitcoin "succeeding" would have to be a lot of things. But more than anything it has to offer a tangible benefit over our current system for most people. Why would anyone use it other than to speculate or for illegal activity? The only time I have ever thought about buying them was to use on the old SR, I can't thing of a single other occasion where they would be beneficial to own. Right now you have people accepting bitcoin via coinbase, but that is only for marketing and to capture the spending of the early adopters who need a way to cash out. It is not because they think everyone is going to start using bitcoin, or that they honestly "believe" in the system, its just so that they can get the spending of suckers like you. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 15:20:48
So if you take away bitcoin's purpose other than money and you have nothing. Its a "new form of property" that does literally nothing and provides no inherent value. You are right that gold is partially valuable because of its monetary aspects, but it only has those because it is used for other shit and will always be in demand. Why not just do what he is suggesting and create a digital currency based on gold? It would solve every single problem you listed with gold and be a lot cheaper 
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:59:19
I get that you are convinced of that, but why? Why will this small and technologically competent group of people use bitcoin for transactions? What benefit will it provide? You say bitcoin is at least as big for currency as the internet was for information transfer. That is nonsensical bullshit. You have made no argument and are simply regurgitating constantly repeated cheers from the bitcoin community. 
My example about gold was to show why gold and other commodities have been used as currency throughout history and why bitcoin is not that at all and never can be. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:12:00
OP said that "Compare this with the new NFC credit card technology we have (in the UK at least) where you just tap your card against the reader and the payment processes instantly, no QR codes, no confirmation waiting time, no passwords or numbers - I don't even need a mobile phone. Credit card fees aside, why would a supermarket ever adopt Bitcoin over this?"
Thats what I was referencing. And please answer, why would they? 
I agree, bitcoin is not a perfect comparison to NFC as they solve different use cases and are inherently different technologies. But his point is valid, what benefits could bitcoin offer over fiat and current technologies if "used correctly" as you say? 
So you are saying that bitcoin being successful as a currency is not with mass adoption but niche use? I think that is the only chance it has really, given how it is structured there is no benefit to bitcoin over fiat that I can see. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:26:08
So a lot of people have gotten into bitcoin, that does not mean it will work as a currency or be adopted in the long term. Those companies you mentioned are not actually accepting bitcoin. They are allowing a third party payment processor to accept bitcoin and give them cash. Their prices are still in dollars and the company will never actually own a single bitcoin. Not to mention the wide majority of the volume (probably 99%) is from speculators and traders, not from actually giving money to coinbase to get bitcoin in return. 
Even with a bunch of people speculating on it, you are still stuck with a commodity trying to function as a currency that is unstable, deflationary and cumbersome, with no real way to change that. And really, you need to read some opinions outside of those in this subreddit and from other bitcoin cheerleaders. You clearly dont understand any of the counter arguments or the downsides of bitcoin, and there are many that are very legitimate. I find bitcoin very interesting. I think the protocol has some value and am very curious to see the blockchain concept applied to real things and what can come of that. But from everything I can tell bitcoin isnt the answer to any of the problems that face currency today and I have yet to hear a reason why it is. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:40:48
But why would the progress ever happen if it provides no advantages over the currently existing protocols?

Please explain how deflation is "actually very good"
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:56:59
But you can't remove the history. And you are wrong about it having little industrial demand thats simply wrong. The thing you are not understanding is that the only reason a portion of golds value comes from the monetary side is because it has value on as a non-monetary instrument. There is industrial demand and there will be for the foreseeable future, along with a very predictable and increasing supply. Thats why its good. Bitcoin has no industrial demand and is finite, two bad things for a store of value or currency. Those properties you listed for gold, bitcoin literally has none of those aside from being useless to industry (which gold is not). 
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:30:36

@_date: 2014-07-23 19:52:44

No it is not, thats incorrect. Gold is being mined at a pretty predictable rate, and the supply is always increasing as new gold comes to market. That is one of the properties that makes it function as a store of value as it does. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:21:46
It does not override any undeniable reality and I didn't say that, stop trying to twist my words. I just said that NFC is a brand new payment technology that is already working much faster, easier and more securely than bitcoin in the real world. Also, this isnt a learning curve problem, its a functionality problem. Bitcoin just doesn't add value. Once you add in all the security, protections and everything else you need to make it competitive with fiat currency it will be more expensive and more difficult to use than fiat. Whats the point?
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:48:13
So you're saying its a currency, but you dont want it to be stable because you like making money off of it as a speculator. You can't have both. Stability is a necessary element of a currency, if you don't have it it won't work. Look at countries with unstable currencies, everyone goes to the dollar. 
Deflation is an amazingly huge problem. To say its not is really dumb and shows how naive you are. 
Why would I try to use bitcoin? There is literally no benefit for me to use it whatsoever other than if I were to buy drugs online. I buy drugs locally, so I don't need bitcoin at this point. I do not want to speculate on it because the risk adjusted return is horrible (I haven't done the math but I am sure it would be). But really, why would I use bitcoin? What benefit does it have to me, a normal american person, over using dollars? 
You can't say currency stability is bad and deflation is good and then call me ignorant, thats the dumbest thing I have ever heard. And yea, some companies might be holding a tiny bit of it, but its nothing real and nothing substantial in the grand scheme of things. Outside of speculation, there is no reason or benefit derived from actually holding bitcoins.

What? If your point is that people don't know what they are talking about you made it very poorly. No one ever thought the old buttons were better than the click wheel.

This reads just like a delusional christian trying to convince someone there is a god. Good luck with your cheerleading. Maybe take a break and take an economics class or two so you can have a constructive conversation with someone about it. You say I am stuck on something I will never change my mind on, all I have asked for is any sort of evidence as to why bitcoin is better than what we have in place. Why it has value. Why consumers or businesses would adopt it over available alternatives. I have asked many more questions than you are saying, you are just choosing to ignore them and "believe" in something without evidence. Have fun investing in bags of piss
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:31:52
Ok jesus christ this is probably the stupidest conversation I have ever been a part of. First, you said "Apple has a long history of attempting to sell products to customers that they didn't want." This is actually misstating a Steve Jobs quote, "A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them." What you said is not that at all, you said that people don't want the products Apple creates after you show it to them, and sales figures over the past 15 years proves that to be very untrue. Yes some people will hem and haw about products going the way of the dodo, but in no way does any meaningful section of their customer base actually wants those products back or stop buying from the company because of it. 
Then you said that people wanted the original iPod back in 2011. The iPod that was removed from the market in 2002. Really? I am sure people were dying for a 5GB firewire only ipod that couldn't scroll when they could have an ipod touch. 
You were trying to make the same point Henry Ford made when he said "If I would have asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses", the same way Steve Jobs did, but you said it completely wrong and made no sense. Thats why everyone downvoted you and I disagreed with you. Now grow up, and go fuck yourself for making me type this.

The great thing about it is that there is no need for belief in anything. This isn't a relgion, its an information exchange protocol that you can understand and witness. I feel I do understand it, and if you honestly think that ridiculous page you linked correctly refutes any of those points you are mistaken. Read some stuff from third parties, stop just listening to other bitcoin cheerleaders who have everything to gain from more people adopting it for no reason. 
I have asked you multiple times and I will try once more, where does bitcoin provide value?

What is a goddamn hassle? Cash? Or bank accounts? Can you honestly say that carrying around a credit card is more of a hassle than getting paid in bitcoin, using a service (that costs money) to buy a gift card on your phone through another third party? If you really want you use your phone that bad, there are options to do that with money. No need to involve a third party commodity to make the exchange 
@_date: 2014-08-14 10:40:00
1. You're an idiot. Don't sell your car to buy bitcoin, thats fucking retarded. 
2. If you lose your house in a tsunami, you likely have insurance to cover it. Same with a bank, you don't just "lose" your money if it goes under. When has that ever happened in the US? 
3. No one is investing when they put their money in a bank or under a mattress, thats idiotic. All they are doing is holding, and the money is losing value due to inflation. Buying currency is never an investment, you get it so you can use it. This isn't the case with bitcoin, because no one uses bitcoin. It is simply a vehicle for speculation, a commodity that lacks intrinsic value more than anything.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:56:08
Honestly, what are you talking about? I am writing off your ramblings as yet another brainwashed bitcoin junkie. Learn basic economics (and grammar) and then reevaluate your investments. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:07:00
First you need to separate the value of a bitcoin and its usefulness in life and in reality. Just because the value of the "currency" has appreciated does not mean it will be adopted or be valuable in the long term. This is not like the internet, the comparison is stupid. I do not advocate gold either, I was just explaining to you why gold is used a store of value and why bitcoin itself does not have those same characteristics. Just because you and others have made money on it does not mean that it is a viable thing. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:12:51
Bitcoin is special because its getting popular right now? And bitcoin has the same infrastructure in place as gold as a unit of currency and store of value? Are you mental? Listen to your last paragraph. The only reason the price of bitcoin has gone up is because of people speculating like a lottery ticket. Its irrational, based on nothing and will not last. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:21:31
Wait you are saying people liked the original buttons on the first ipod more than the click wheel? You're an idiot 
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:58:07
No the whole reason gold makes sense as a "monetary commodity" as you are using it is because it has an intrinsic value for making actual goods and because it is mined at a very predictable rate. To have intrinsic value as a monetary commodity it has to have intrinsic value on its own. Not saying that bitcoin cannot, but unless it can provide real value above what is available today as a means of payment it does not. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 16:05:17
Jewelry is the main reason for the demand, and just because you might see that as "frivolous" doesnt mean its not a real reason. People wanting to look nice and have nice things and appreciating the look of gold is not going away. Thats its natural usefulness, along with its other industrial uses. 
Bitcoin is in no way special. There are a bunch of other cryptocurrencies, bitcoin is just the most popular one right now. Bitcoin is not digital gold, that makes no sense whatsoever. Good luck with your speculation.

Haha there isn't one, thats the problem. And by the point the infrastructure gets built out so that it is usable, and it is as easy and convenient as it is to spend money today, it will be as expensive or more expensive than our current system. You need to learn more about why we have currency and its purposes, it would help you a lot with your speculation. 
@_date: 2014-08-14 07:18:17
That is really, really stupid
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:15:02
You keep saying I dont understand bitcoin, but it is clear you don't understand currencies or economics. I didn't attack you at all, if I attacked anything it is bitcoin. Lets compare it to something, take gold for example. Gold is a commodity that is used as a store of value throughout the world. Why is that, did people just pick it a long time ago for some reason and just stick with it? No, because gold is used all over the world and actually provides value to people. If you have an ounce of gold you can go anywhere in the world and sell it to people because they, in turn, can sell it to people who need it and will use it to produce things. The reason people continue to use gold for things, and don't just horde it, is because there will be more mined tomorrow. Having that increasing supply is the reason it will be used instead of held, the watchmaker will go ahead and make the watch and sell it to someone instead of holding it and waiting until next year to make a watch with it when there is less gold and you can get more dollars, euros, darics or whatever local currency you will sell the watch for.
With bitcoin, no one needs them for anything. There is literally no use for them whatsoever. Yes, you can use them as a means of exchange, but that is not an inherent use of the coin itself. I could use a bag of my urine as a means of exchange if someone would take it, but unless a bunch of speculators started buying up urine bags and increasing their nominal price, the only true value of that bag of piss is the water and minerals it contains. It would cost you money to seperate those, so arguably its worthless, just like an unpumped bitcoin. So lets assume for some reason bitcoins became a prominent currency over the next 5 years and hits $50k as people like the winkeviossesses say it will, once they are all mined why would anyone continue to provide the processing power to back the transactions? Why would anyone use a bitcoin if there is no more going to be made and you can just sit on your "cash" and have your worth increase over time? If its a commodity and the supply is limited and the demand is increasing, as the population will be, why would you use it for anything? In reality, without speculation, bitcoin cannot be leveraged because there is nothing to leverage. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 07:09:01
The point is that there is new gold being created (mined) every year and that it is being created at a pretty predictable rate. Bitcoins will stop being created after a point, gold wont. The relative rates of growth are irrelevant. The fact that bitcoin will stop being created and the supply is finite is really, really bad for it being used as a currency or store of value. 
@_date: 2014-07-23 19:26:55
What is so simple about it? I have to buy bitcoin, put it into this wallet app, then buy gift cards for specific amounts before I go to a store and then spend them through another app (I presume). Seems a little too difficult since it offers no real benefit to the consumer above just spending cash

The fact that your speculative gambling on a currency worked out for you is not a reason why its a good currency. Its a bad currency in every sense of the word, and shouldn't even be called that at this point because no one uses it as such. Its purely an instrument for speculation and nothing more 
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:31:11
Its not a gold substitute. How on earth can one of the most voliatile "currencies" ever be a reliable store of value? Regardless of the price stabilizing, it has no qualities that gold has such as natural demand and growing supply. Thats what people dont realize about gold, the reason why it works so well as a store of value is due to the supply increasing every year, not because we only have so much of it. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 23:44:18
What do you mean by the burger thing? 
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:43:57
There isnt any natural demand for bitcoin, no. How many situations can you actually say bitcoin is superior to regular money&gt;? How many people actually use bitcoins for things because its better vs doing it for the novelty of it or to push their own speculation? And the gold supply grows every year at very predictable rates, and there is consistent and real demand for it for use in jewelry and electronics. Bitcoin is deflationary and there is no natural demand for it. It doesnt function as a currency or store of value. So what are they going to try to re-brand it to next? Just say screw it and call it what it is, speculative gambling? 
Oh, and tons of people have lost money on bitcoin. And what makes it so great is that its a closed system, so the only way to make money with bitcoin is to take it from some other bagholder who lost money on their speculative gamble. Great system there, really advancing technology and the world 
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:59:41
Gold isnt necessarily scarce and the supply is growing constantly, so its not deflationary at all 
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:18:36
Haha thats not natural demand, thats artificially created demand and pretty much the definition of it. And on the second part, you're talking about criminals right? Good argument
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:24:59
Gold isn't supposed to be currency, no one argued that. Its the idea that bitcoin can "replace" gold as a means of investment for a store of value type asset. My point was that bitcoin has zero qualities that gold has, even with that frame of reference. 
And bitcoin can be used as a currency, its just a shitty one that doesnt provide any real benefit
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:54:17

Censorship resistant? What do you mean by that? And if you think that bitcoin isnt going to be regulated by the government you are very sorely mistaken. And deflationary is a horrible thing for a currency, not a benefit

Dude none of what you said is legitimate. I am not keynesian, thats such a dumb and ignorant insult to try to throw at someone who disagrees that bitcoin is the savior of all humanity. Advocating anything non-deflationary does not mean that someone is a subscriber to Keynesian economics, and to try to pin that down as a giant school of thought rather than a few discrete ideas is disingenuous. Your arguments against other cryptos is just you trying to defend the scheme you will make money on. Yes, most all of crypto is a scam, along with bitcoin which is just a natural Ponzi, but a lot of them are more fundamentally sound than bitcoin and there is absolutely no argument against that. And I have been following bitcoin since the price was in cents, its an interesting experiment but it has completely failed and its flaws and poor design has been exposed for what it is. Worthless. And the broken window fallacy is so stupid, and none of your examples are of real economic activity. Youre talking about eating shit. And again, not defending Keynes or his ideas, just believe bitcoin is wrong and misguided without that entirely. You realize there is a whole hell of a lot more to economics than Keynsians vs others, right? Thats a tiny slice of one tiny part of the field 
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:23:02
Haha you really missed the point. A company selling a share of stock is an exchange of cash for the rights to a portion of the profits for that firm. Thats an investment. Of course, that share of stock can be sold to someone who is speculating, I said as much. Bitcoin is only speculation, there is no investment in anything, its a closed loop system. You can speculate on both bitcoin and stocks, as well as currency, but the stock market isnt a means for speculation, its a means for firms to sell shares to the open market. Speculation and investment are very different things 
And you thinking you are investing in the ecosystem by providing demand is hilarious. The only idea of an ecosystem is the pipe dream that speculators have. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:33:38
People can speculate on Google stock, yes, but thats very different as you are actually investing in a company and they make money with the money invested. You betting on bitcoin only trades it with another person, that money isnt being taken and invested and multiplied like it is when google or someone issues stock. I dont think you understand the difference between investing and speculating. You can speculate on both bitcoin and google stock, yes, but you can't invest in bitcoin itself, doesn't work like that 
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:18:49
Hah they really dont though, but keep telling yourself that. And bitcoin isnt anonymous and there are better tools for that. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:56:37
Deflationary currencies are insanely stupid. Why would you want a currency to siphen off value from assets? Thats insane. And talking about returns is really, really stupid when talking about a currency. Its not a security, its not a bond, its a currency. You don't want crazy increases in value, its intrinsically bad
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:54:31

@_date: 2018-06-20 16:29:37
Cash is an asset buddy. Its a superior asset to a house in certain ways, particularly its ability for its value to be realized in a much more efficient and quick way. On the other hand, its an inferior asset class when you want money to grow. Are you saying that investment shouldn't occur? Your rant doesn't make much sense. What is wealth to you then? And is a dollar not an asset to you either? That seems like a really dumb argument based on semantics. Deflationary currency is insanely stupid and would be horrible for any economy 
@_date: 2018-06-20 15:10:19
Haha you really need to understand what "peforming" means with respect to a currency. If you mean the relative value has increased more and faster than any other currency in history, thats actually evidence that its the worst performing currency of all time. Record breaking instability is not a good attribute for a currency, period.
@_date: 2018-06-20 18:34:42

@_date: 2018-06-20 18:33:28
Honestly this is just so far off on so many things, I am not going to go beat by beat. But it is deflationary, and its very clearly spelled out how that will work. And a centrally controlled currency does not necessarily mean bailouts. And printing more money? Do you even understand how money is created? Most all money is created by lending by banks. That is manipulated by the fed by them changing certain interest rates, but its mostly all done through loans. And bringing up loans is really funny, that is basically impossible in a deflationary environment. No one would ever do that. And your understanding of value is very hard to grasp. Deflationary currencies are dumb.

The general users have zero power here, what do you mean? And the barriers to entry can't lower as fast as the complexity and difficulty of mining is increasing. It will never catch up, thats the whole point. And its not that they would intentionally destroy it, but they would cooperate with one another and keep fees high and stop changes from being made to the ecosystem that would disrupt their businesses. No regulation, no reason why this wouldn't happen at all. And Canada and America have higher electricity prices and higher taxes, terrible move and will only make the system more expensive (for no reason whatsoever I might add, bitcoin still accomplishes absolutely nothing)

@_date: 2018-02-08 22:25:48
Haha so a group of individual miners can choose to destroy the entire system, thats my point. They will only become more concentrated over time, with the increasing cost and complexity of the calculations the investment required to mine will be higher and higher, so the industry will consolidate to a few large firms who control everything. Then they operate like an oligopoly and bitcoin is even less useful and more pointless than it was before. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:31:59
This is so stupid. Scarcity alone means nothing. There is only a certain number of everything, so scarcity alone doesn't mean shit. What bitcoin has to have is demand, thats how it has value. Unfortunately it pretty much does nothing worthwhile, which is why there is basically zero value to it outside of being used for speculation.

A couple groups with a majority of mining power can, its super easy and takes like 4 people.

Haha nice to get it done in a reasonable amount of time, read his post. His other transactions weren't going through. And bitcoin is so fucking dumb, he has wasted tens of thousands of dollars vs using actual functional banking
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:43:34
No it was done by taking money from other people speculating on it, its a zero sum game. The only ones who will net a profit on this are the miners, any trader making a profit is matched with a trader losing that amount of money. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:55:38
Yea and they don't understand how and why it is, nor the reality that most money is actually created by commercial banks, not the government. Their world without debt would be a hellhole to live in and could not function as it does today

Haha only a month ago, what a joke. $1100 for one transaction, its mind numbing how stupid that is. The only reason transaction fees have gone down is because volume is at a 2 year low, no one uses it for anything at all except for speculation.

Seems like there is a shitload of trust involved int this "trustless" ecosystem. And why wouldn't the big miners form a cartel? Its painfully obvious its being consolidated, and with increasing complexity and cost of mining rigs it will only be accelerating in the future. They will cooperate with one another and fees will cripple the entire system

Absolutely they are, it could never be a currency and it was obvious from the very beginning. No transaction volume, too expensive, its silly. Now its a "store of value" when it has zero qualities that a store of value needs to have, its baffling to me. Whatever it takes to recruit new bagholders I guess 
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:17:37
That analogy is retarded
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:22:34
Yes, its quite funny to recognize that the laws are still needed and that bitcoin has done nothing to make them obsolete
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:25:21
Not US, very different situation
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:03:52
You mean the most widely used currency in the world and the basis of 95% of contracts around the world? Yea, that won't pose an adoption problem at all
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:42:21
Incredibly hard to get when compared to any other currency. Anyone in the US can get other currencies from around the world much, much easier than bitcoin at this point. We are talking laymen, average people, not people who are obsessed with technology like most bitcoin owners. 
And look at above, where is the privacy and anonymity in that?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:28:27
In a "currency" that effectively has no use 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:30:02
I am making the same realization. Once you read the insane and nonsensical arguments you see on realizing they are just a bunch of kids makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:16:26
Guys, OP is 15. No wonder hes so dumb and short sighted. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:12:21
No, he is just exaggerating to make a point.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:09:09
So the fact that bitcoin is incredibly hard to get using the most widely used currency in the world isn't a problem? And the benefits of privacy, anonymity and tax avoidance are gone, and that's fine?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:24:25
So, you mean a bank?
@_date: 2013-11-30 13:26:31
No, ultimately, for it to work, it has to be worth the investment for everyday transactions. Bitcoin is purely speculative at the current moment, and without that changing it has no future whatsoever and will crash down very soon
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:43:56
That you lose money working as a pizza delivery guy. No matter what happens they have to pay you up to minimum wage and you most likely make a whole lot more than that on any given night

We love futility?
