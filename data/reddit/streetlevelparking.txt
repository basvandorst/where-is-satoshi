So what's the actual process here? There seems to be an unspoken structure of rounds, votes, and points, but none of this seems to be articulated in any way. Then it says that the shareholders get the final say, but what are they choosing from? These finalists? Anything they want? What's the purpose of the voting then?

No need to formalize it, it just would have been nice if any of this had been communicated in advance, or really, at all. I feel kind of stupid responding to your call for more submissions in the last thread by wasting time on an entry just for it to be ignored.

I agree that the sub community should decide the sub logo, but I think the bounties should go to whomever the shareholders like.

I didn't mean for that to come off angry. Sorry if I came off as a dick. I appreciate you trying to improve the sub. Just some communication would have allowed me to plan my time better.
As for just submitting it in this thread, that fixes it for me, but not really anyone else. What about the non-finalists? Can they try to get back in? What about others thinking of entering who have yet to do so? Should they submit along side me?
My suggestion would be to reopen submissions with a clearly communicated deadline (GMT 00:00 one or two days for now). After that have a new thread where a top level comment is made for all submissions, and all other comments are deleted. Users can vote on all submissions, and only up votes are counted. I've seen other subs handle voting this way, and since it replicates approval voting, it is pretty fool proof. The bounty contributors should decide and announce ahead of time when they will choose the winner.
Just my 2cents though. If you want to continue this way, I'll just throw my entry in a comment here.
