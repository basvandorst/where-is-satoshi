It could, but right now you can't.
The unconfirmed transaction handling and new blocks processing runs together in ``btcplex-prod``. If you run it while building the db, it will mess things up.
Building the database is not that long, you should give it a try.

Or

When it make sense for sure.
It's different from an "web app", since no data is user related (block chain is public), and I want Google (and other search engines) to be able to parse the website without overhead.

Why it should be a single page app ?

No you won't see it if a transaction happens while it's down, you'll miss it for now, but I think it's possible to get (only) the latest transaction when coming back up, if you're interested by this feature, please open a new issue on GitHub.

I would love to try it out!

Thanks for the feedback!
When blockchain api goes down, it wait x seconds with an exponential backoff before it tries to reconnect (1, 2, 4, 8...).
I have it running for weeks whithin a Flask app and had no issues so far.

I wanted a lightweight solution that doesn't require downloading the block chain, and I don't use this library to validate sensitive payment, just for monitoring some donations addresses.
For sure if you use this module, you have to trust blockchain.info, I agree that I should use SSL, don't know why I'm not using it yet.
Why should I verify the signatures of the transactions ?
Thanks for the feedback!
