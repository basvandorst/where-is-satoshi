na, bitcoins pow is sha(sha(...)), so these machines are only useful for cryptocurrencies

Regardless of the authenticity, these things can happen and the discussion is interesting. So who cares.

Tech is simply not his thing. The guy has his principles and following them made him rich. One of them is that he only invests in what he understands. 
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:32:30
As far as I know, yes

Poker is not random. Poker is about estimating probabilities and guessing how other people will play. The better you are at it the better you play. Sure you can get lucky against a pro, but averaged to playing many games, he will win more often than you.
I started to play tournament games with friends and I wasn't very good at the beginning - made the typical beginner mistakes, playing too many hands for example. I was out of the game very quickly and lost every time. Practicing online made me a very good player, almost winning every tournament with my friends because they didn't play and practise online, giving me an edge in every game.

And fear forever that someone is following the money train up to you. Doesn't sound like a good retirement plan.

At 7 tries per second, as suggested elsewhere in this thread, that would mean ~23 days.

The very people pouring in droves might also sell their bitcoins in panic. There's no reason it can't continue - and theirs no reason it should continue. One big player cashing out will burst the bubble - and that's a good thing, because then we might return to lower prices and lower fluctuations and we can actually use the currency outside of speculation.

You preordered one, I'd assume. You can't order them atm.
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:09:14
We should put your theory to the test and just post it straight away to TIL

Most deliveries will charge you a shipping fee (even if you call your local pizza place directly) if you're below a certain amount. Or you supposed to tip the driver.

We could also be very well in the denial phase - with the real crash ahead. It's rising too fast again.
Edit: Downvoting me for saying that this is a possibility... pfff guys, how ironic
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:37:46
I don't think that's a good thing though. We see huge fluctuations in value these days and that makes it harder to actually use the currency, other than for the purpose of speculations.
Also: When a unit of currency rises in value from $13 in January to $150 in April we are witnessing the very definition of a speculative bubble. 
Sell your precious tulips while you still can.
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:33:46
You're right. So please OP, crosspost to TIL
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:57:39
I also ordered with bitcoin and didn't have a "shipping fee", because my order exceeded the minimum price (10€).
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:07:30
Do yourself a favor and wait this rally out... there is no reason it can't go on, but there is also no reason that it must go on like this.

You're right, FLOP is floating point operations per second. The whole bitcoin network power is actually 0 FLOPS, as not a single floating point operation occurs in its proof of work. An ASIC does SHA256(SHA256(x)) and just that. They are specialised machines to do that and only that, they are not computers. So comparing it to computers makes not much sense. And measuring something in FLOPS even less so. But hey big numbers!

Zero-confirmation dollar payouts? How is that not asking for trouble... or do you have to wait 10 min in front of this thing to get your money?
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:12:14
I've used it and they are now my  choice for ordering food online. Wonderful. Bitcoin payment is accepted with 0 confirmations, my food came in 30 minutes. 20-30 restaurants to choose from in my city.

You might also be able to simply grep your bitcoin adress - it's only a few bytes. Then you can run +/- a few kilobytes around it through pywallet recovery.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:52:35
I hope you did heed my advice! You might get your bitcoins soon for 70$ or below...
@_date: 2013-11-19 10:46:39
Mining the miners,  that's what they did.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:16:58
Thanks, I didn't notice that!
@_date: 2013-04-26 10:06:20
Well you would test with a smaller amout of money first?
@_date: 2013-10-31 11:19:35
I think they try to avoid any exchange risks.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:52:58
Forget the tulip thing, what i wanted to say is the 10x price increase is not due to highly increased usage of the currency (people buying and selling goods), but due to speculations. And the high fluctuation makes is harder to do actual business with bitcoins, because its value might change hourly.
@_date: 2013-05-13 13:11:41
There was actually a whitepaper on an idea to do arbitrary randomised algorithms in an alt-coin, where best results are rewarded through additional mined coins (alongside traditional mining to secure transactions). Coins can be used to buy computer time on the network and would have intrinsic value.
Unfortunately I can't locate the paper, maybe someone else has it? They wanted to used a sandboxed lua client as interpreter for these algorithms.
I think some people are also working on CancerCoin, which would donate some of the computing power to cancer research.

Theory disproven then. They understand it!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:31:11
Yes. But no one has proven that SHA-2 is secure, nor that brute force is the only and best attack. It's not a law. Actually, collision attacks are there for up to 24 rounds of sha-256 ( decreasing the security margin to the full 64 rounds. 
Not to speak of the fact that before bitcoin most security researches focused on Collision,	Second preimage and Preimage attacks. The proof of the work in bitcoin is that certain bits of a SHA-2 hash are zero: which might be easier to exploit and attack than the usual cryptographic hash properties.

Why did you cry? You still made a decent profit!
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:27:17
The ATM is an exchange machine, if bitcoin moves into the wrong direction they give out bitcoins cheaper than what they had cost to put in the hot-wallet. That's the exchange risk and considering the huge volatility of bitcoin it's only understandable that they don't want to take it.
