Tell me what you think of my response to vbenes, which would constitute my same response to you on this point

'Users' does not equal transactions. Most Bitcoiners are simply HODLers looking to get rich quick, and not actually use it as a currency, but to use it as a speculative vehicle. 
I've tried reading through your argument there, but it was quite opaque to me about what it is supposed to demonstrate. What I think I can gather from it though is that you have not included a crucial factor in your thoughts, which is blockchain bloat. For Bitcoin to be able to process 1000 tps is absurd to begin with - 1 million tps is simply ridiculous.
I assume you do not know about blockchain bloat and its implications, so I will briefly explain. A Bitcoin transaction is on average, around 500 bytes in size. It's a tiny size in itself, but multiply it by the number of transactions taking place, and it becomes a substantial figure. 
Today the size of the blockchain is approaching 20GB, and if you look at it's growth over the past few years, it's been growing exponentially.
Now at the moment, Bitcoin is only processing 1 tps or less. It has an artificially capped limit of 7 tps I think it was, and an artificial block size limit of 1MB. This is designed to prevent blockchain bloat, but obviously if transaction numbers grow, then either these caps will have to be removed or the network will come to a standstill (transaction processing will become severely bottlenecked).
Now if you do the math as I have (and I can explain the math by which I came to it if you like), then to match Visa, each block would need to be approx. 437MB in size.
Now a node, which is a machine connected to the network of nodes who broadcasts the blockchain (absolutely essential to Bitcoin's continued existence!) and does it purely for free, has to both download the blocks and then upload them to other nodes. So every ten minutes they would need to download at least 437MB, plus (much more importantly!) upload at least 10x that (so, ~5GB).
Now multiply that by thousands of nodes per nation or continent. You'll find that infrastructure, such as submarine optic-fiber cables connecting countries/continents simply wouldn't be able to cope - not even a decade or two from now! This infrastructure is both extremely money and time consuming to build, put in place and maintain. That amount of internet bandwidth would also be extremely expensive to the end-user, who I remind you has to run the node for *free*!
Plus, and this is perhaps easier/cheaper to solve, storage for ~20TB+ per year would be required. Seagate have said they are not releasing 20TB drives until at least 2020.

Care to explain yourself then, if you think I've got it wrong?

Because you are never informed of it as a Bitcoin user. You don't get asked once every ten minutes if you consent to giving away your money to miners for processing a block. You don't even have a choice in the matter.


I think most Bitcoin users know that miners receive rewards for mining blocks, and even perhaps the exact reward in BTC - but I don't think that it would register to them as $25 every second. Or ~$15,000 every 10 minutes.
I also don't think they realize how small the pool of active BTC actually is. For instance, they might think it 21 million (even though 13 million is only currently mined), or they might think that 13 million is 'active' - whereas it's much more likely to be perhaps ~5 million or around that. 
A figure of 5 million 'active'/'accessible' BTC would mean that 25BTC every ten minutes is actually having quite a profound inflationary effect. I might be mistaken here in my quick calculation, but that appears to be 26.28% p.a. - that's dangerously high inflation!

You can use whatever terms you like!
The fact is that people are paying $35 for the privilege of being able to conduct a transaction. Those who don't conduct any transactions at all, are simply giving away their money for nothing.

It only costs you a small amount to send the transaction, but other Bitcoin users have to pay for it - they have to pay for the 25BTC block reward every ten minutes (it dilutes the worth of their own Bitcoin HODLings)
So say you have 1 transaction every second. That's 600 transactions per block. 25BTC divided by 600 = 0.0417BTC per transaction = $25.81 per transaction.

The fact remains that a Bitcoin transaction currently costs $35. That is what Bitcoiners are paying for. If they make no transactions at all and simply sit on their money, they are just losing it for nothing.

Last I checked, Bitcoin is down over 50% in the past few months


But Bitcoin holders would nonetheless lose $25 per second - even if there were no transactions. That's just the base cost of maintaining the Bitcoin transaction network. Seems expensive to me.


So what happens in 2040 when that distribution effectively stops? In fact you could argue it really stopped back in 2011, when ordinary people ceased being able to generate their own Bitcoins without buying some $10,000 specially-designed machine to do the work for them.
Isn't the whole point of people buying Bitcoins now, to make money by selling them to people later who missed out on the initial distribution?
I haven't consulted the latest figures, but wasn't it something like 0.01% of Bitcoin addresses hold 75% of all Bitcoins? How's that for fair distribution?
And there are only about 2-3 million non-empty Bitcoin addresses right now - even if all of them had substantial amounts of Bitcoin, then that would only be ~0.02-0.03% of the world population! So much for being distributed!

Do you know why Bitcoin has inflation?
The fact is that Bitcoiners are paying $35 per transaction. If you are a Bitcoiner who makes no transactions, you are simply giving away your money for nothing.

That's because it acts as an indirect stealth tax, rather than something you have to pay up front and are notified of.
I bet many Bitcoiners aren't conscious of the fact that their Bitcoins are being inflated/diluted at rate of $25 per second.
The cost of a Bitcoin transaction, not just for the one doing the transaction, but the cost to all users, is important when making a comparison to say, fiat transaction networks.
How much does it cost to do a transaction using Visa vs. Bitcoin for instance. Perhaps when we think about it, we might come to the conclusion that paying $35 per transaction simply isn't a good deal.
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:34:53
You comments are irrelevant, or are least not counterarguments, to the issue of a transaction costing $35, but for the sake of humor I would like you to explain to me why Bitcoin has inflation in the first place (as a separate topic)
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:18:45
Don't Bitcoiners believe that the price will continue to go UP, UP and UP!!! as time progresses?
If so, what difference would block reward halving make then?
Keep in mind also that the next block reward halving isn't expected until the end of 2016
Even then, you'd have a reward of 12.5BTC - which if you apply it right now would make the cost of a Bitcoin transaction $17.50
