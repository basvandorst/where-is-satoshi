Does anyone know who McAfee really is other than the developer of McAfee security software and quack presidential candidate he is a very shady, unstable, paranoid guy with some very questionable goings on and almost definite connection to the murder of his neighbor in Belize (Allegedly ordered the hit)
There was also all kinds of other bribing of public officials and shady things you should learn about before he fled Belize and eventually made his way back to the U.S. and decided he was suitable to become a presidential candidate(WTF?) 
Long story short:
John McAfee is not some sort cryptocurrency oracle...
That being said if this brings more people into the bitcoin or crypto world that is great i just hope they don't take him for anything more than an enthusiast

If i may add i think these debates and discussions are important and healthy for users of cryptocurrencies and and buts it is important to educate yourself and have your own opinions based from that education...
