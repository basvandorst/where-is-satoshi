[Still you:](
You: "Hey guys look at my Rem body pillow I'm retarded!!!"
Everyone else: "Fuck off retard"
"Hahah Jokes on them I only pretend to like anime body pillows!!!"
Seriously though, I don't give a fuck what your hobbies are. I look forward to your next strawman against me.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:22:58
I said nothing ill about machine learning in general. ML is very broad.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:40:31
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you're one of those nutjobs that think you can use neural networks to model bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:12:13
Show me your github and then we'll talk.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:21:02


Dude, this doesn't mean jack shit over whether or not NN worked out well or not. Seriously...


I mean, I don't think it's a big deal but was it that hard to look it up yourself?


This doesn't make any sense. I have bad reading comprehension because you choose to act of "wild nonsense" on the internet? And I'm autistic because of this? What? Didn't you literally just link me a meme about this? Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Jesus fucking christ that's one of the worst comebacks I've ever seen on reddit.
Edit: Apparently you [linked yourself](
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:17:42


Uh sure. Really easy to google that one dude.


I'm saying nn don't really do well outside of computer vision. Was it that hard to read that from my post? "...in the context of computer vision, which is kind of why NN haven't left that domain."
Doesn't seem that hard to me.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:45:35


@_date: 2018-01-17 21:32:52
Cool, now explain to me how you'd use a neural network to make your fortune with bitcoin, which was my fucking question in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:42:59
Can't say I've never seen this before. Your very own insults ended up backfiring, and now the only thing you can do now is cup your ears and scream "I won I won I won!!".
I've seen these kind of arguments before. You know your insults don't make any sense so now're your just projecting yourself onto me. 
You link me a meme, yet you claim to be that very meme in defense of me pointing out some stupid post about anime body pillows. Apparently I'm the one super upset about all this?
If that's "winning," then by all means take it. I don't want to be *that* kind of winner.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:25:04


I bet you don't even know how to write a tiny program to perform linear regression.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:37:45


Found the charlatan.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:20:48


Behold, the defense of a charlatan backed into a corner.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:08:25
No, I'm just sure you're one of those idiots that think neural networks  and machine learning are synonymous terms, so I don't need to waste anymore time arguing with a charlatan.
Not that this topic mattered anyway, since it was bait in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:37:25
Again, it's no different than screaming it in a theater. Anyone can read it.
And yes, please keep me out of your online subreddit friend group. I definitely don't want to be a part of it.
Also your remark on Meltdown is a bad take.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:21:40


It's on reddit, viewable by anyone in the world with access to reddit. That's as public as it can get. Did you seriously think otherwise?
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:35:07
You using your own meme against yourself is a thorough beat down? Your mama is going to be proud.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:54:03


So... [still you](


More strawman


More projections? I thought I addressed this in my last post. What am I to be confused or scared of? You made yourself into a fool with your petty insults. They backfired. I called you out on them. Now you're tellling me your strange behavior is "just getting entertainment" ([which reinforces this as you](
Whats amusing is that you brought all of this upon yourself. I don't care if you're the biggest weeaboo in the world, but you were the one that ended up getting all defensive about it when I brought it up. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:25:44
Dude, no amount of mental gymnastics is going to rationally explain why you joking about an anime body pillow makes ME autistic. 
Also, this [is still you](
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:52:27
I think you need to take a good look at yourself before you start judging me.
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:58:37


That's a pretty bold assumption to make off three dots. I was floored by how hastily you brought up a tangential topic. Hence my further assumption that you didn't know jack shit about machine learning. It's clear now you know somethings, but not really so much about NN since that's out of your domain, which is fine, I don't know much about yours either. 


Maybe they were, but that doesn't mean they were necessarily successful. Any non linear features learned were probably all trash anyway. I also doubt they had this much computing power as it wasn't easily obtainable at scale until 2010+, unless you're telling me they had state of the art chip designers.
Lots of people throw tons of different techniques at different problems, but that doesn't mean its correct. It's usually just indicative of someone who A. doesn't understand the technique, and B. doesn't understand the problem.
Also I don't know why you keep assuming I google shit. I've actually implemented many algorithms from scratch in the several courses I've had to take. Try actually deriving the learning rules for a neural network by hand, and you'll see why the commonly loss functions are used.
I also don't understand why you always bring up some stupid strawman about video games. I could find any number of your hobbies and do the same, yet I don't do I?
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:05:16


But it never made sense... I don't go on reddit pretending to be a retard, but you **literally** say you do.


Wait, this sounds oddly familiar "I've got you so upset that you've regressed into a child going "i know you are but what am i?""


You know when you say inside jokes publicly, it just makes you look retarded. It's like screaming "I LOVE TENTACLE PORN" at a movie theater. Everyone but your friend group will think you're retarded. Hence why I keep linking your own meme against you, again, and again, and again...
I find it fascinating how you keep digging yourself a deeper hole.
This is [still you by the way](
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:59
You didn't really explain anything specific to why neural networks suck. Backprop makes a strong assumption that errors are normally distributed around the underlying deterministic model. They do this to make the derivatives nice, and generally doesn't matter in the context of computer vision, which is kind of why NN haven't left that domain. 
Also a simple "No I don't think they are good" would have sufficed.
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:10:31


Citation please.


Again, I think you need to take a long hard look at yourself...
You pompously take pride in your ignorance of what "FUD" is because it wasn't immediately relevant to your shitty day job.
Also enjoy your Rem body pillow. Yeah, I can look at your post history too.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:55:03
I think it would be a great pick, especially with all the mystery surrounding this individual. It's fascinating and tragic, with the fact this person can never sell their coin without forfeiting anonymity.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:14:58
Not a real tree. Does not compute. Hodl until end of universe.
