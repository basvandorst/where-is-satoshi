Thank you. I have been trying to post to r/bitcoinmining and it's not letting me yet. I guess I have to wait a while. If I knew about it before hand, I definitely would have posted this there.

Great! Any idea where I should start learning how to mine?
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:06:01
I have hundreds of billions to spend on ASIC hardware.

Please don't pretend to be sincerely addressing my question. I made a mistake asking here apparently.
There was nothing more counter-productive than my asking this question here, or you "answering" it, so I doubt I'll take you very seriously.

Thank you. It sounds like ASIC is the way to go. Do you have any suggestions as to where one might learn how to set it up once they get it?
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:04:57
Thanks for the advice. I do want to mine for 1 BTC in 5 years (or any number of bitcoins greater than 0). I'm feeling pretty lucky, despite this thread..  lol
Any advice as to where I could learn how to mine that 1 BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:38:11
I have. It doesn't concern me.

Holy shit people..


Since I'm asking about purchasing a miner, and I've stated several times that I'm not interested in transacting for bitcoins, only mining them, I have no idea why this is so hard to understand.
I was actually hoping to spend at least $50,000.00 on a miner that would get back .00007 bitcoins, so this will have an unintended consequence of being more profitable than I imagined! All the more reason!
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:22:08
So there are returns, ever diminishing as they are, right?
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:08:25
Whether it pays off 500,000%, or 1.5%, is not something I'm concerned with. I'm not concerned about the difference in cost between mining bitcoins, and purchasing. I'm only interested in mining bitcoins for the sake of mining bitcoins. If anyone could help me learn how to do this, I'd appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:52:08
Is there any miner I could get, &amp; power, that would produce Bitcoins? If so, I'd like to do this.
The only money I'm interested in making is Bitcoins. I'm not interested in transacting at this point (other than for a miner).
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:33:21
I don't want to do that. I've hinted toward what I'm looking to do a few times in this thread..
I'd like to mine them.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:37:08
I want to have an income of bitcoins that is dependent on my management of the mining rig, and not jumping through any other hoops. Also, I'm not looking for short term, or maybe not even mid term, profit. I'm not really concerned with "profit" at all right now. I'm interested in acquiring bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:26:43
Thank you!! You're a beautiful human being!!

It won't be laughable to me, and I'm not doing it for anyone else.
I don't have the option of going back in time to order a miner, or building my own manufacturer, so I can only act today. I'd like to take the best steps as a miner *today* that I can. If there are no options that won't be "laughable" by delivery time, then who has the non-laughable miners? Those building the miners? That wouldn't surprise me, and that makes some sense, but I don't see how I could start building miners in the next 2 months. It may be a far inferior alternative to buy one, but it's the only other one I'm aware of, given my goal to start mining asap.
If there is no step to take that makes sense for miners, than no one will take them. What will that do to the difficulty? It's ever evolving, and I know the miner I hope to purchase won't be effective forever.
Perhaps I should check my premise. If purchasing a new miner isn't the best way to start mining asap, and for a decent period, then please tell me what is.

It's too late to mine bitcoins? I don't believe this is accurate.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:05:05
I'd like to mine them, and not transact for them.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:23:01
That's a good point.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:34:33
Also, when looking to buy a miner, you're looking for the best ratio of mining power, to power consumption, right?
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:36:23
I do understand this. Some of you have some preconceived notions in your head about what my goals are here.
I just want to mine for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:37:37
What he said, too!  :D
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:12:16
Thank you. I've realized how mistaken I was. Trying my luck at r/bitcoinmining now.
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:03:29
Especially in my case..  but I'm not interested in modeling. I'm interested in mining.
With that in mind, wouldn't buying a new miner result in me acquiring more bitcoins than would using a CPU &amp; GPU miner right now (which I'm interested in, btw. Thanks!)?
