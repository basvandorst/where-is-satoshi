Meh. Rather have Bakkt BTC-settled futures market and related products.

There are like 4-5 commissioners, those are the main people like Hester Peirce. Below them they have other people who have been handling the ETF stuff due to so many applications, which they then review and make their own decision on (either reject the lower group's decision or agree with it).
What happened recently with the applications is that they decided to review them (this was for the non-Van Eck ones) and for Van Eck they decided to open another comment period, and then a comment rebuttal period before deciding.
They also made some really dorky/dumb statements about the Van Eck ETF, like "worrying" about retail small time investors being able to get in, which doesn't make sense given it's a 25 BTC buy per ETF share.
I don't pretend to know the entire structure of the SEC though, just that there are the main appointed Commissioners, and that right now they have a larger group of people under them doing ETF evaluations due to the high workload.

Such a clever comment /s

Rewards? As if they're good enough to use Visa over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-16 20:13:39
They vary based on the number of inputs - so if your wallet's balance is the result of a lot of small transactions coming in, that would be more expensive than if it were the result of a single transaction.

Yeah they need to add Amazon.
That said, Microsoft being on the list is really good, since MS sells a variety of third-party PC hardware (prebuilt PCs, VR headsets etc).

Bakkt is exactly that sort of adoption.

It's still censorship. It's just not censorship that is illegal.
Words still have meanings.

Not edgy, but accurate. It's called having self-defense laws.

Shit tier boomer comic.

TL;DR: Bitkee or Crypto Key Stack are the winners with good robustness to damage in each category and minimal/no data loss.
Personally I'd go for Crypto Key Stack because you can engrave existing seed phrases.

Gay and pointless.

If Trump said "I hate Bitcoin, it's bad and no good at all!" the MSM would run 24/7 coverage of how great Bitcoin is for at least a month.
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:27:39
Yeah I find the not your keys argument silly when you're talking about massive shared-ownership accounts where someone is managing a big pool of lots of peoples' money.
Eventually there will be ways to do that and distribute the keys (I know the tech is already there) but it's not frictionless as it needs to be right now, so these institutional investors need an intermediary solution.
Will it eventually be better to distribute some sort of multi-sig key scheme? Sure, but we're not there yet.

I'd like to see PayPal at least produce *some* semblance of evidence. Of course they have none at all and we're expected to just 'listen and believe'.
Fuck PayPal, and anyone who thinks this is a good thing.

Comments rebutting the initial comments, is my guess.

If this were some sort of fractional reserve lending you might have a point, but it isn't.
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:30:13
It should, at least in theory, given that this will mostly be money that didn't have access to the existing Bitcoin market. 
That said we're talking about a futures market (long and short) and a custody product, rather than a Van Eck style ETF or something, so there will also be downward pressure from shorting. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:20:56
Completely agreed, I'm over this shit, even with the VanEck ETF. I bet it will be approved eventually, especially given as you say their arguments are hilariously weak.
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:43:40
Pretty sure it's a straight approval like CME and Cboe were for CFTC, so not a lot of fanfare. I don't see any reason they would deny it given it's the same thing as the others just with Bitcoin settlement.

Sending cash by way of donkey is practically faster than SWIFT, and Bitcoin is easily faster. 
Never had a Bitcoin transaction take a week. SWIFT, that's the norm.
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:33:00
Yeah it's bullshit, they send it to people hoping they will be scared enough to send money, not because they can back up the threat.
Got a couple of these myself and just replied telling them they are now known to the FBI for attempted wire fraud and blackmail.
I knew it was fake because I don't have a webcam on any of my computers, so how did they supposedly get video of me jerking it? 
@_date: 2018-09-27 22:35:02
They're propagandists and are barely even hiding it now.
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:30:11
Drug dealers don't really use crypto. Most transactions are cash. Of the crypto that is used, Bitcoin isn't one anymore.
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:05:59
Yeah that seems insane... it's obviously not aimed at small retail investors given the initial buy in and accredited investor requirements.
That should be obvious as you mention, OP. SEC is being disingenuous, seemingly on purpose, here.
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:32:04
SEC blocked US customers from buying ETNs, I heard.
Not that I disagree with your point.
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:38:37
Do you have any reason to believe the CFTC would deny Bakkt despite already approving similar futures markets that are cash-settled?
I don't.

You can believe in blockchain, while pursuing a centralized "blockchain" scam?
(X) DOUBT
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:32:21
Centralized, and with none of the benefits of Bitcoin.
Top comment is all about how they love blockchain though, just trust them, guys.
@_date: 2018-10-01 17:45:15
Not unless they can prove you committed a crime, which receiving 'tainted' funds doesn't count as.

They're accumulating, and keeping BTC in the price range they want to accumulate at, while buying OTC and selling small amounts on the public exchanges to keep the price in range.
That's my theory, based on nothing much except the weirdly stable price range, and the rumors of lots of OTC traffic.
