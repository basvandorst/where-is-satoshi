Hmmm... we went from 17k to 14k in 3~4 days... I think the wave can go up again... there's still time.

Sir, to the moon is the dogecoin theme. Such shame, much copy.

I was stupid, and lost 0,01 BTC trying to trade on this recent "calm belt"
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:26:22
Did a little trade right now with this oscilation and got 0,02 bitcoin. Better than nothing =x

I just wish our problem was bitcoin regulation... not everything else.

"Firstly, if bitcoin is meant to be 'decentralized' and somewhat anonymous, why do I have to provide so much information about myself, including ID, to random websites, in order to convert it to anything useful (GBP)?"
Sooo, you want someone or something to pay you for your digital coins, and want this magical being to just trade with you, giving "real" money without any identification? REALLY?

Which chart do you guys check? The one I use (coinmarketcap) seems to have a delay on the fluctuations...

Well... if you lose your Ledger... you lose all bitcoins, right? Or you can do backups of it on your pc/phone?
But at least it would be YOUR fault, and not because some random dude hacked something... and that's positive.
