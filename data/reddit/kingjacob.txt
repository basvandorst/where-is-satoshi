I'd say you understand my point, you just disagree. Why do you think ethereum has everything to do with bitcoin? They have separate value props, different monetary policies, and different features. 
Additionally, a coalition of major ethereum projects created wrapped bitcoin so it can serve a function in the evm. And this was well received by the eth community. So while I'm sure there's an eth maximalist out there, most people view them as serving separate functions.

Hard drives are pretty good. It's just one part of it though. Could make it more detailed by adding a series of tubes lol.

Storing is less of an issue as block propagation.

They're running a promo with trezor ( so you might want to email them to see if they'll still give one if you order via the wrong link.
