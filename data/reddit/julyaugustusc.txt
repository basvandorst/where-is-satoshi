I get your point which wasn't exactly the logic I was referring to, and I understand that using the debt as a scare tactic isn't the best.
But are you not too using a fallacy insulting the intelligence of someone who is concerned of the rising debt in American and the value of an American Dollar that is backed by said government that is in so much debt?
Your metaphor is way too simple for many reasons and I honestly just think it's bad, but you and I both know that. 
The point I'm making is that like other people in debt, there's sometimes a point to which they are TOO far in debt and can't make the minimum payment and there's the fallout from that. "Every single time they come up" no longer happens. I understand that the US can borrow money for less that it can make on that money. But when that all falls apart or stops being true? Or it can't borrow what it needs? Your argument falls apart.

Um "world's first billionaires from Bitcoin"... Doesn't the creator have something like 1mil Bitcoins somewhere? Which is now equivalent to 10bil+? 
First known I guess...

I don't follow your logic

Was just living there, ah that rent sucked! Are there any sources for the bay area specifically?

Ah yes just made this point as well. THE CREATOR is worth 10bil+ cause he has 1mil coins to his name.
