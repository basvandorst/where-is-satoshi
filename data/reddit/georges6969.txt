“The middle-man is there for a reason”, he says on r/bitcoin, with no self awareness whatsoever

My FDIC insured deposit account at a reputable institution?

��������&lt;— this is you jerking off on some buzzword salad, random technology with no chance of actually being implemented, and wishfull thinking concepts with no real use case
See what I did here? I used the Internet latest development, the emoji, to insult you, your lack of critical thinking and your doomed hopes of blow and hookers. That’s one more legitimate use case than bitcoin will ever have

Well no you clearly don’t, look

Bro now you’re just being childish

Lol nobody cares, unseizable custody is not a thing and smart contract has already been debunked ten million times since the DAO: if it’s a simple transaction it’s already automated, if it’s a complex one you need humans to interpret intent when disagreements arise. Also, smart contracts only apply on on-chain data, making them useless for anything actually meaningfull.
Get your head out of your ass.

Well you can, what do you mean? People with 2m+ in assets usually don’t though, cause that’d be fucking stupid.
People for a long while have intuitively understood that not yoh dolla dolla bills not your money, so they’d rather have their assets under their name in custody at reputable institutions, under the protection of the law, rather than stashed somewhere for anybody to steal or extort.
Incidentally, for any reasonable investor to touch your shitcoins it would take some of the same reputable institutions to finally launch crypto custodian platforms, which of course would ultimately defeat the whole purpose.

Lol cool story bro, if anything you’re inside your own ass.

Do you have the master’s degree in electronics engineering to don’t trust verify that your trezor was not tampered with at any step of the supply chain though?
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:51:10
Yeah, do put them in a mix of productive baskets under custody at reputable institutions rather than untrustable shit baskets with no value, that would require expertise in computer science, IT security and electronics engineering to make even marginally safe, and with no recource whatsoever when shit eventually hits the fan.

Oh my fucking god. For you to understand how much of a morron you are, you’d have to be guided through what actually happened in 2008, what kind of behavior led to that situation, and how it has little to do with fractional reserve banking and literally nothing to do with any problem bitcoin actually pretends to solve. You’d also have to look for a sensible explaination of how a bank actually fucking works, which of course you have no intent to do as you already seem to hold your flawed understanding of so called fractional reserve banking as a perfectly sufficient model of our fucking economy.
After years of flawed research in the crypto space you managed to convince yourself that your understanding of finance, comp sci and infosec makes you savvy enough to hold an enlighted opinion, but you’re wrong: your knowledge is subpar at best in some areas, and completely off in the other. You’re not a lion, you’re a fish in a small tank full of sharks and you’re going to get eaten.
Enjoy the ride moon boy.

Wait you mean to say that Bitcoin would be better suited as a currency if it had a low, centrally managed inflation rather than a constant deflation?
