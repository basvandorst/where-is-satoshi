On the flipside, why does anyone other than me and the merchant need to know what I'm buying?
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:39:24
That's strange. It seems like giving up an encryption key would be self incrimination....

But Bitcoin is actually a messaging system. When someone buys bitcoin, what actually happens is that a message is sent to the network saying this wallet is giving this other wallet bitcoins. It's literally just a message. And the blockchain? It's a chain of every message ever sent. There's nothing actually being transferred. Just a broadcasted message
@_date: 2014-01-24 05:32:39
Any articles to back this up, or is this speculation?

I actually really hope that the evidence gets dismissed because of fourth amendment violations. I would love to be able to say that drugs are what helped us restore some of our constitutional rights

Nope. Its going all the way TO THE MOON!

Not really. For your mugging example, that's a clear threat to someone's life. If you don't give them the money, they would stab you and that's clearly not a message. That's an attempt at someones life. 
For the digital transactions, money is actually exchanged. If a bank sends money from accounts internally, it looks like nothing is exchanged, but money is actually exchanged. This is much more clear when you send money from one bank to another bank. The receiving bank is going to want actual cash from the first bank. Not just an IOU. 
Bitcoin is different. It literaly is just a message. Nothing needs to be transferred. Nothing exchanges hands. Just a message.

If you are so inclined, you can sell them on coinbase for a good bit of money. However, I would suggest you hold onto them for  a little while longer. Bitcoin is going down in value currently, and isn't as high as it could be
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:19:24
What I was saying is that someone then would try to produce and allow that would mimic gold in weight and color that would be much cheaper to produce. If the coins are of a trivial denomination, like $2, then you wouldn't check them because they would be so commonly used
@_date: 2014-12-25 15:35:29
Not necessarily. You could produce an alloy that would have the same color/look/feel as the real coin, but also is much cheaper than the original
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:11:11
Which exchange are you looking at? For most of the exchanges that allow quick, easy, and cheap selling of bitcoin to USD, the price is much lower. At some exchanges, like Mt Gox, bitcoin sells for much higher prices because of the difficulty associated with withdrawing money from them. It can take weeks and a large fee to get your money out of Mt Gox if you live in USA

I disagree that it's not unenforceable. Since apple controls both the app store and the phone, they could possibly build backdoors that grab user's passwords on apps that provide encryption then store them somewhere. For encryption to work, you need a lot of trust.

We would probably have 6 to 10 miners up at a time
@_date: 2012-12-17 03:06:23
With my 670 overclocked to 1345 mhz and the miner I have now, its only getting ~120mh/s :/

When im at class and stuff, the computer just sits around, and i'm not paying electricity. I figure its at least put to good use with this

And it totally worked on me for a minute. I read this and got really sad that we pushed the possible creator away, but then I realized that he hasn't proved it. It would be trivial to prove it, and he refuses. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 04:19:46
Damn man, maybe he really wasn't a troll 
@_date: 2015-10-20 14:46:40
I think it's amazing he even got 6.5 years. There has been a huge push recently to hold LEOs accountable, and it's been starting to happen. No, this guy didn't get burned at the stake for treason, but can we all agree that it's a good step that he is going to jail and not suspended with pay?
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:23:08
But who's responsible when Bitcoin fucks up!?!?
@_date: 2013-08-06 17:52:13
I'd hate to interrupt the circle jerk about a woman on reddit, but that breifcase is actually really neat. It's things like this (pretty cool and able to convert USD/BTC and vice-versa) that can really help the adoption of BTC. 
Also, why did they feel the need to mention the tail...?

Based on the upvotes on this post, people seem to agree with blocking the site
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:33:03
The only thing is that could get confusing because i think there is actually a way to donate your processing power to help process transactions
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:12:44
So like, I dunno, is it entrapment if an unfrienslyChemist who is actually a cop tells you he's going to rat on everyone and another undercover cop, let's call him redwhiteandblue, comes around randomly and says he will kill the unfriendlyChemist?

Thank you, at least someone realizes that once a coin is lost, it's lost forever. I sorta get mad when people waste coins like this. IK that whole argument that it'll increase the value of their coins, but it's still the principal. There is a finite amount of coins that will exist. I'd prefer to not lose them if its possible
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:15:11
It's still alleged. Nothing has been proven. And I really doubt the governments story...
@_date: 2013-10-03 16:07:08
The more I read over this stuff, the more incredulous I am of this story. I understand that everyone makes mistakes, but this story just doesn't add up. They caught fake ids going to his address is new York, and he didn't think to move. They got him to hire a man, who contacted him first, to order a hit on another man. They have him saying he ordered at least one hit in the past. All the evidence of him making small, silly mistakes in the past. I ~~think~~ know they didn't catch him they way they claimed to have caught him. Our government couldn't even catch bombers that other countries warned us about (boson bombers). I hope he has something up his sleeve and I hope he can prove the prosecutors violated the law in catching him so he gets off Scott free

[Here's a link to the source code and some binaries]( The binary file doesn't seem to work for me either. any thoughts/suggestions?
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:26:55
For the mining section, I was under the impression that mining was generating hashes, not processing transactions
EDIT: but for the slogan, may say something like be apart of history in making and its the currency of the future
@_date: 2013-06-03 07:27:16
In all seriousness, that miner looked sexy as hell, but never looked remotely possible of being real. From the renderings, the miner looks like it may have been around a cubic foot in size, which is pretty damn small to be drawing/dissipating 2800 watts. It also didn't appear to have any sort of power supply or brick which would have been necessary for that sort of usage. Plus there is no way that anyone in the USA produces the proper processors for this machine (the site says it is 100% made/maunfactured in the USA). It looked shady as fuck from the start, so I'm not surprised in the least bit
@_date: 2013-02-18 05:44:34
Not to be a debbie downer, but mining is becoming much less profitable with the ASICs coming out. They already have doubled hashrates in most major pools
@_date: 2013-08-19 20:55:32
IMHO, I think that some users would be a little scared to buy into this device if the source code isn't released immediately. I'd personally be afraid there is some sort of network traffic analyzer thats collecting all my info

Also, if this article had any truth to it, then everyone would withdraw their money from the banks and just keep their money in cash form. Corporations would stop using banks would pretty much just cripple the whole banking system. Once the banks are crippled, the only way to get paid would be in cash. Employers could pay employees off the books and stop recording their profits accurately. In the end, the government would lose a lot of their income from taxes and it wouldnt be worth it

I feel like the government cant really shut down bitcoin, so they are trying to control it now. They cant really do that, though. No matter what, bitcoin will be completely anonymous and , correct me if i am wrong, you cant really prove that someone paid someone else with them
