That transparency was a technical necessity because devs didn't know better. Now, after ~10 years of research, devs figured out how to do privacy while still keeping blockchain safe.

look here: 
there are currently ~30k transactions being put into blocks before yours. Thats 10-13 blocks. but: new transactions are pouring in every second. So its going to sit there for a long time and could potentially never confirm. But: this transaction has nearloy 300 outputs, some of them are valued at hundred thousands of dollars. Chances are that one of the other receivers loses patience and bumps fee with CPFP or similar techniques or funds a TX accelerator or whatever. The TX emitter could bump fee with RBF as well.

situation is not ideal for sure. What about the following strategy: the users wallet sends a low fee transaction first, and raises fees via RBF regularly until it confirms. Eg fee is getting 10sat/kb higher every hour.

My experience as a user: I switched to segwit. The real one: bech32, not P2SH nested crap. And holy moly was I fucked :D Basically all I can do now is transferring cheaply between my own wallets, because no service in the world supports bech32 yet. 
Even claiming airdrops is so complicated now that I really think about moving all coins back to a legacy address, I lose way more money by not being able to claim and sell airdropped coins fast then I gain by cheaper transactions :/ 
Business view: Why should I, as a business, rush out segwit support now if my backend does not supports its final form yet? sure, we could add P2SH, test everything extensively and go live in 2 months, but bitcoin core with final segwit support comes out in 3 and we would need redo everything which is expensive and risky. So nope, we are waiting and will implement segwit once  bitcoin core 0.16 is released.
While we are waiting for core to release, there is still a lot of work to improve: Intelligent UTXO management and batch processing saves _a lot_ of blockchain space too, needs its time to be done correctly and can be reused with segwit.

I made a low-prio &amp; low fee transaction a month ago which did not confirm eventually and was kicked off the mempool about 3 days later. However, max age of transaction before it drops from mempool is a node config variable and can differ. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 13:48:53
sure, check the VIA BTC TX accelerator and google how to RBF and CPFP. But that won't be cheap (as in: hundreds of dollars) because this transaction is huge. Only thing you can do is accelerate it for everyone, not only for you. Thats why I recommend to wait and hope that one of the other receivers or the sender accelerates.

@_date: 2019-07-02 22:55:33
You can do that and it will work but you won't profit. 
Let's say you fork the network to bitcoin2 now. Then you can make a transaction on bitcoin2 and replay it to Bitcoin easily. Only problem is you still need the valid keys to move the Bitcoin which you won't have unless it were your own keys in the first place. 
If you somehow hack bitcoin2 so that you can transfer BTC which you don't own and then replay this transaction to Bitcoin it will be rejected because Bitcoin still enforces the rule that only the key owner can move his BTC.  
So you basically win nothing UNLESS you find other people which install and run bitcoin2 with it's new rules.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:47:20
I already received a b2x coins from my bech32 electrum wallet with help from someone who created a raw transaction from my bech32 address and sent it via sendrawtransaction to the blockchain with the b2x client, which is a fork of core 0.15.2.
So its possible for sure, only I'm to stupid to do it myself :/

block explorers are just sites which allow to look up data in the blockchain easily. thats public data anyway  so there are no real security implications, however this site could track users and log their searches.   
to mitigate this the usual web privacy enhancing techniques can be used: runnign a privacy respecting browser, tor, vpns, etc pp.
Or one can run a blockchain explorer locally, afaik at least blockstreams explorer is open source and available via github.

send all your BTC to a new wallet with the lowest valid fee of 1sat/byte. this way you will consolidate all your small UTXOs into one big UTXO.  
Its a good idea to create a segwit wallet so you save on future fees as well.

Saving on fees is a strong incentive to optimize transaction size and strategies for every user. All stakeholders profit from that. However, paying some fees does not automatically mean paying huge fees, there is a sweet spot somewhere between too low and too high.

51% attack on bitcoin could happen if hackers overtake 4 of the biggest mining pools in a coordinated attack: 
That is not easy but doable. 
Biggest "candidate" for a 51% attack however ist bcash imho. Its a coin with much fiat value, and hackers would only need to hack one of the top 5 BTC mining pools (or a few of the smaller ones, or small parts of a few big pools, or a significant part of one big pool, etc) to gain control over 51% of hashrate. 
I think initial big-scale attacks will target BCH for practice, before going for the big one.

Bitpay is exceptionally expensive in BTC because they want to push bch, but however, BTC transactions are not free.  In times of high usage it costs a few bucks to be included into one of the next blocks. 
For transactions which are not time sensitive you can usually get away with a fee of 1sat/byte but have to wait hours/days to confirm.

First you need to split your coins. To do it safely, simply ctreate a new electrum wallet and transfer your BTC from the old to the new one. Now you transfered your BTC only. The old wallet looks empty but still contains the forked coins.
You can now install an BCH wallet, eg. electron (which is a electrum fork which is modified to support BCH), import your old wallet and your BCH will show up. 
Additionally you cam claim Bitcoin Gold coins the same way, by importing your old, now empty BTC wallet into a bitcoin gold supporting wallet

you can run a node in prune mode which somehow does what you described. However, some people still need to have full nodes because you can't use no averagyes like you suggest. lets assume I transfered 100 bitcoins to you in block 1000. 
If you want to transfer this 100 bitcoins somewhere else, you'll use the output of my transaction als input to yours and a node will _look_ into block 1000 to make sure you really own this coins. ITs the same with all transactions, the blockchain is not dead but is used contantly by nodes to verify and make sure that no one cheats.

Exchanges deal with huge numbers of input and output addresses and repeating bulk transactions. There are big block space and tho fee savings possible if you do it right. And hell of a lot possibilities for subtle bugs which lead to expensive/slow/inefficient transactions in the best case and losing bitcoins in the worst.

I too only use BTC payments from known sellers where I'm very sure they won't fuck me over and paypal for all others. 
However, Bitcoin is meant to be used with escrow. 
Satoshi writes it himself on page 1 of the whitepaper: "Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers."
Whats currently missing are the easy implemented escrow mechanisms. I silently hope paypal adds bitcoin support soon or there emerge some other players offering reliable escrow services for BTC.

AFAIK you can transfer directly to onchain addresses from an lightning wallet, so transition should be painless. And incentives for the big player to update will be strong, because when people will be able to send basically free and instant to some vendors and slow&amp;expensive to others, its obvious which they will chose

Imho ths is the corresponding PR:[
Its possible to crash a node with a special manipulated block.  I'd like to read a risk analysis for this bug. On the one hand crashed nodes won't propagate this block, on the other hand there could be a well connected miner serving bad blocks via FIBRE crashing main miner nodes around the world or a bunch of well connected nodes targeting exchange backend nodes randomly.

@_date: 2017-12-16 14:48:49
that depends. many levels of detail are possible. the most superficial answers which show that someone at least roughly knows how bitcoin works are: 1. a script with definition of inputs, outputs, opcodes which wire ins to outs, a timelock and signatures to secure that whole thing. 2. a block consists of its parents hash, coinbase, transactions from mempool and a nonce. 3. latest blocks are broadcasted via BRN (nowadays FIBRE) networks.

With RBF (replace by fee)you can raise fee after transaction was sent but is not in a block yet to get it into a block faster or to redirect it back to the emitter. 
It works the other way round as well: with a CPFP (child pays for parent ) transaction the receiver can bump up fees to get a stuck transaction into a block.

Im sure you'll find some desperate btc holders which will fuck your gf for btc.
Or another idea with much more reward potential: you can lure the guy into being alone with the both of you and then hit him with a wrench repeatedly until he gives you his private keys. then transfer everything to your addresses, hit him for another 10min until first confirmation and you are good to go.
EDIT: Lets hope for the guy that the mempool is empty and confirmation times fast

Two questions:
1. WTF did you not use a self hosted bitcoin core node as the backend like every sane person does?
2. Do you have the  BIP39 mnemonic to your [blockchain.com]( address so you could have generated the private key for this address yourself?

implementig segwit correctly is _a lot_ of work. plus there are simply not many developers in the wild which are experts on this topic, so progress is slow :/ Aditionally all exchanges are overrun by new customers, there were the various forks and alts to handle, all in all: this takes time. I'm sure they could have done more but it is like it is :/
People are bitching the exchanges but don't forget, even bitcoin core does not support 100% of segwit in their current release. Its planned for 0.16 mid 2018. I assume most companys planned a big backend segwit upgrade, but what they need to do now doubles the work: partial upgrade now and final upgrade in 6 months
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:04:24
np, you need to export your private keys from your old wallet and import them into the new one. I guess best is you google how exporting works for the software you use. important is: keep your private keys secret. 
@_date: 2018-09-17 13:31:46
yes, an ISP sniffing all traffic will see private transactions come in and go out from this node in stem phase and will see no transaction come in while still seeing one going out which indicates that this node created the transaction with high probability.   
Dandelion was not invented to counteract midm attacks.

depends on the miner configuration. Its most probably a few weeks. However, you can return the transaction or speed it up by using RBF.

the test suite is used to test various lightning implementations for compatibility, its bascially the spec in code. 
However, to pass all tests you need not much more then a proof of work, and this is basically the state of LN currently. However, most devs say LN core network will be usable somewhere in 2018. the big question is how fast the ecosystem around it (wallets, clients, payment processors, etc) will pick up. If you look at the state of segwit adoption I guess we are talking late 2019...

Although the fee situation currently is not ideal for user, we have to cope with it. Cryptocurrencies are generally not easy and won't be until the ecosystem matures in the next few years.  So this is my direct advice: Learn how to bitcoin. Bitcoin is a complex, immature and not idiot proof system. It will save you a lot of future headache if you now learn now how it works. How do I know that you don't know yet what you are doing? Because someone who knows does not use the term "medium to high fees". How high were the fees? What do mempool- and blockchain explorer say what your transactions are doing? 
If transactions are still in mempool, you can speed them up or return them back by RBF or wait till they expire naturally.

block size increase is inevitable and its a point on the official bitcoin scaling roadmap since 2015. So yes, block size will be increased if its needed. But until its needed there are many, many options to increase information density in blocks which will be exhausted first. eg. signature aggregation, various swap techniques and future updates to BOLT which focus on minimising on-chain traffic to name a few and most important the magic of channel factories, which could be seen as level 2 itself making LN level 3 lol
TL;DR: another block size increase is on the table for years now and it will be done when needed.

classical use case: generate 20 addresses, one per customer and run a script which detects missing payments and sends reminding emails if no btc arrived. you can do that using bitcoin core as backend.
lightning version: (this is theoretical, never did it myself). AFAI you can't reuse addresses so every payment needs an invoice. Run a script which checks if last weeks invoice was paid and creates a new invoice for next week and sends it per email to the customer.

1. Electrum is one of the oldest wallets, its open source and battle tested. very secure. For it being a cold wallet you should not go online with that pc at all. best is you install a secure and stable OS, eg a LTS version of the flavor of linux you like best. if in doubt use ubuntu 18.04 and don't go online with this computer at all.download electrum from its homepage on a different pc, verify signature, put it on an usb stick and install it from this stick to your cold pc.
2. yes, extremely secure
3. that depends. all wallet encryption does is it encryts the local wallet file. If you encrypted the whole OS in the first place, another encryption of wallet file is not really needed imho.

blocks are meant to be full. users  need to learn how to use btc the right way: 
* use lightning for small payments. 
* decide if you want your transaction to be fast or cheap
* don't hesitate to broadcast transactions with low fee and let it sit in mempool unti it confirms in times of low usage
* use rbf to change fee if you change your mind 
* minimize transaction size be using segwit and multiple outputs
full blocks and a somewhat higher fee levels incentivise users to learn good habits,and  developers to modify their software for better blockchain space utilization. Thats a good thing. empty blocks lack that incentive because its cheap whatever you throw at the blockchain.

hardware wallets are pretty useless for long term (as in +5 years) storage. why? you need to backup your keys anyway because wallet could fail and with the backup you have your private keys copied: in HW and in backup and you need to store your backup safely anyway. so why do you need the hardware wallet in the first place?HWs are useful for frequent transacting while keeping a good security level. but for cold storage? bip39 mnemonics secured by multisig or a shamir scheme is king.Most people won't have any compatible USB ports on their devices in 10 years, wallet will need  a firmware update over multiple generations to be useable IF they are still supported so people with their HW in cold storage won't take the hassle and simply use the good old bip39 to access their coins

Its possible but for BTC not probable. You need 51% of hash power. That is more sha256 hardware then currently exists unless the attacker somehow gains control over multiple huge mining pools for multiple hours without them noticing. and even if: the gains somone can make with a few big sells and chain reorgs are probably much lower then the gains of honest mining.Its the smaller blockchains which are at real 51% risk. eg bch. It has about 3% of btcs hashrate. that means an attacker needs control of 1.5% of btc hash rate to successfully attack bch. Whether one could make that attack profitable I don't know but attack costs are low enough that a big miner could attack that small chain just for fun to see it burn

@_date: 2019-03-17 16:28:45
The trick with 51% attack is to produce valid blocks and play the system. Eg you secretly mine your own chain faster then the rest, transfer btc to an exchange, sell the btc for a different currency and then release your own chain for reorg. It contains fully valid blocks, but your transaction to the exchange is missing so you still have your btc while you sold them for profit
@_date: 2018-10-17 10:27:26
I don't like it because:
* while "slow" and "fast" have virtually no meaning other then slow is slower then fast, any value on the slider between slow and fast  has even less meaning.
* you show the user the fees/byte which are meaningless because you don't show him the size of his transaction
Honestly, I have no idea how to do this fee thing dumb-user friendly and still somewhat meaningful.
How do I do transactions? I check the urgency first. If its not urgent i send it for 1sat/byte and recheck in a few hours or next day or so and bump fee a little if its still in mempool. If its urgent i check Johoes mempool stats and estimate a fee which will get me into one of the next few blocks, set the fee and recheck after a few minutes it it confirmed or I have to raise the fee to confirm.With this strategy I pay 1sat most times and a lil more sometimes.
Could one pour this into a newbie friendly gui? I gueass one could if you fucus on the confirmation time and not the fee gui-wise. Here an idea top of the head:
* you dont ask for fee, but for max confirmation time. steps eg: 30min, 1h,2,h,6h,12h,24h
* lets say user chose 1h, sou you have 6 blocks to get his transaction into a block. start with 1sat/byte. check if its next block, if not RBF it to 2sat/b and wait for next block, if not confirmed 4sat/b, then 8sat/b, 16sat/b, 32sat/b.
* lets say user chose 24h then you have 144 blocks to work with start with 1sat, wait for a few blocks and raise to 2sat, then to 3 sat then 4, etc. pp until it confirms
* of course you can check mempool state initially and come up with some more intelligent fee raising steps for every block then my examples
I hope you got my idea: let your app work it out for the user in background. You don't need to let him set one fixed fee, put it into mempool and hope it was by luck not to much and not to low to get confirmed in justifiable timespan.you can readjust fee after every block and could visualize the process in intriguing ways, gamification and what not: "boom we missed confirmation by 2sat this time, blocks are coming in fast, hashers are crunching like crazy today, 32 blocks to go, we'll do 2.3sat now wish us luck go go go go yeah we did it it took 1.2h, you paid 2.3sat/byte thats 0.000002345 btc fee in total, heres your overall stats"

Segwit adoption charts are misunderstood and overestimated imho. Smart systems won't use segwit currently because blocks are empty, they will use it as soon as mempool fills and fees rise. The same goes for batching. Current batches are small and will grow in size and slow down in frequency as mempool fills and fees rise.  The same is valid for utxo selection. Systems use dust now because its easy and will chose fewer inputs if its needed.

So yeah, in a future where Bitcoin became the world currency there still will be PayPal's and bitpays around which will offer escrow services and an easy user interface for people which are to stupid to handle their life saving Private keys, which are most people I'm afraid.
And of course there will be good old banks, because people need loans to buy stuff which they pay later.

Hey, just a side note: we discussed segwit extensively on every channel in 2015, 2016 and half of 2017 and everyone was tired to repeated the same arguments for years. in mid 2017 discussion was not stifled, it was finally over, there was nothing to discuss anymore and it was time to act which people did. big majority went with btc including segwit and a few people forked off with bch - this way everybody was happy.

most important part is that you get a wallet generator that nobody tampered with. I use [ release v2018.01.23 but you should not believe a stranger on the internet (me).    
Then you need an offline pc without malware. many people buy an old laptop off ebay for a few bucks where they install linux on ,use it offline only and only do bitcoin related things with it. So get one of these, copy&amp;run your walletgenerator to create a paper wallet. Its a good idea to make a testwallet first and transfer some small but not insignificant amount to it, lets say an equivalent of $100. Then wait for a week or so. If nobody empties it you can be pretty sure that you have built a secure setup and can generate as many paper wallets as you like in future.

1. You are the one that fucked up and the only one to blame
2. Its very likely that coinbase simply can not access any BTC on that address anymore. The fact that they moved already does not mean coinbase moved them.
3. Even if coinbase has access to that key they can choose not to help you. having a team of employees ready to help (ex)customers solving their problems is expensive. If estimated costs of running such an operation exceed the revenue of doing so, a company won't set that up
4. You could sue coinbase and you could win. In that case coinbase will be forced to retrieve your bitcoin if possible and charge you a juicy amount for their service.
5. Coinbase is a bad company nobody should do business with. however, in this case they are not in the wrong.

there is no such thing as  "a legit mining site". To mine bitcoin profitably you need electricity at &lt;5ct/kwh, then you need a few miners, say 100 x Antminer S17-53TH/s which cost about $300k, then you need to prepare your mining facility to handle power draw and heat emissions. Then you join a mining pool, eg slush pool is a nice one: [ And you are good to go!If you have less then say $100k available and/or electricity costs of &gt;5ct/kwh simply buying bitcoin and hodling will be more profitable then running a mining operation. however, people from time to time don't mine for profit but for fun.  Then the idea is simply to get a few used miners, set them up somewhere and let them run. You won't make much money but help the network.

The easiest way by far is to find someone who gives you cash for your paper wallet. Second easiest way is to buy something for your bitcoin. If you don't find anything you want to buy, get amazon giftcards etc and spend them on stuff.  
The correct but not so easy way is create an account at a reputable exchange, eg. [Kraken.com]( then install a reputable Bitcoin wallet, eg electrum from [ then use electrum to swipe your paper wallet and send your bitcoin to that exchange, sell for your local currency and transfer to your bank account.

all this investing schemes are scam. all of them, no exception.What you do to invest in bitcoin is
1. make an account on a reputable exchange. I recommend Kraken bur there are a few others.
2. define which amount you want to invest every month and then buy BTC for this amount every month
3. Get a hardware wallet and transfer BTC from exchange to your hardware wallet regularly
Thats it. All you need to do is buying regularly waiting for next mooning which will happen in a few months, a few years or never.

you can download, modify and run the sofware to your liking. If you made a change which you think will benefit all users you can propose to add it into master branch of original project. You do this by creating a pull request. A pull request is basically a description what you want to change and why. 
The projects development team will discuss whether you change is to be included in future releeases, will review your changes and finally merge it into master which means that it will make it into next release. 
However, if your change is not accepted you can still use it in your own repo. You can tell other people about your repo with cool features and make them use it. There are many examples of Open Source projects where a fork ended up being way more popular then the original project.

I'd give you your $1000 back because I'm a nice guy but this is not how companies work. assume I was a company with say 10mio customers. lets say every day I get 1000 messages from (ex)customers which claim they wired money wrong or whatever. Lets assume handling one case takes an hour, then I need to employ 100 people doing only this. this costs me $50000\*100 = $5mio per year.
Lets assume 90% of all claims are pure nonsense, and 10% of the non-nonsense claims have some significant money at stake then 10 people will sue to get it back.
If my lawyer and processing costs per year are lower then $5mio on average per year then doing nothing until I get sued is exactly what I'm going to do.

You can achieve a very high level of privacy today as a user by educating on and following good practices. Additionally bitcoin will get a good load of fungibility enhancements with next soft fork (taproot, schnorr, mast &amp; friends). 
real buildin privacy features face 2 main problems currently: first there is the problem of transaction size. private transactions are huge compared to conventional transactions. second problem is a systemic one: software has bugs. inflation bugs can be detected easily on bitcoin, because one can always count all currently existing bitcoins in the utxo set and verify that no one has created any bitcoins out of thin air. but if you have a privacy blockchain, where no external instance can check how many coins were moved between which adresses at all hackers could exploit bugs and create coins and nobody would notice for a long time. Then there is the aspect of reliability. people will rely on the privateness of their transactions. what if 5 years later a bug in the implementation is found which would lift privacy of all transactions ever happened? many people would be in much trouble. That is why incorporating privacy into bitcoin is widely seen as impractical and to dangerous currently.

@_date: 2019-10-08 14:55:47
The most comfortable customer experience is most of the time not the most profitable.  
See it this way: If your customer support reacts quickly and is a competent and pleasant experience people will use it constantly to ask stupid things so you need to employ many, many employees which don't don any productive work.
If your reputation is that customer support is slow, harsh and incompetent people will only contact it as last resort and solve 90% of their problems themselves without bothering you. This way you can keep your support team busy, small and cheap.

For small amounts which you are ok with to lose: do not use Windows. You can use eg a (non rooted) smartphone. Way safer then win.
For big amounts you do not want to lose: use a hardware wallet.
For you life savings: use cold storage. airgapped devices &amp; multisig.

I guess you did. Your list is not complete as there were many more forks and airdrops to BTC holders. Check forkdrop.io for a full list. I claimed and dumped them all asap and ended up splitting my free money: I used one half to raise my BTC stash by ~10% and the other half to wildly buy nice things. 
However, many of the shitcoins were not easy to claim and not easy to sell. I'm subscribed to many many very obscure exchanges now lol.  
Some forks never materialised, many had a very short life and networks are dead now. Multiple clients had malware in them.
On the bright side there are still new forks and airdrops coming along from time to time nowadays but the golden age of free money for BTC holders is gone for now at least.

Thats not a question of technology. Lets say bitcoin payments get some mainstream usage and a vendor gets an order from iran, Russia or whatever country the US has trouble and imposed sanction at that time. Then buyer from this countries will get the exact same message when paying with btc because the vendor won't risk jail time.

People use the pis because they are very common, available and cheap. However, they are not very well suited as Bitcoin nodes tbh. 
Eg all that multimedia capabilities are not needed for a node you access by ssh only. No graphics but waaaay more ram and faster storage connections would make a better performing node for sure. I made a fully sync with my pi 3+ a few weeks ago. It took 21 days :)

I get your point, buts thats not how the world works. Lets assume we project your image to the extreme. turbo capitalizm. there is no government, everyone pays for everything out of his pocket. So what will happen to the new born witty guy which is born into a poor family? There is a high chance he will die because his parents can't afford basic healthcare like tetanus vaccines or or a few weeks in hospital when he got pneumonia after playing outside on a cold autumn day and falling into a pond. So his parents will do the same parents in 3rd world countries do: produce babies as fast as they can just for the chance that some of them survive. So lets assume 3 out of 10 children of poor parents survive their first years, what will they do for a living? not much, because they can barely read. School is fucking expensive and parents could not afford. 
On the other side, what will children of rich parents do? They will survive because of top notch medical care. They will get great education and extra tuition and will attend to top universities because parents can afford. And they will get great jobs because of their parents network and education background. See how I never mentioned they need to be smart? because they don't need. Not completely retarded is enough for a successfull life if you have a rich and well connected family. 
So where in this picture is the fairness? the survival of the fittest, the smartest, the best of the best? There is none. If you were lucky at birth you win, if you were not lucky at birth you lose. thats it.
Social security, universal healthcare, free education and stuff was simply invented to make the competition evenhanded. Only if someone born into a poor family still can survive and get a good education to start his live, he is able to compete with the richer guys for his slice of the goold ol' capitalizm cake in life.

good. But I don't believe you because someone pays for it. If you mine bitcoin and want to earn 100$ per month it will suck thousands of watts and will cost the person who pays for your energy multiple hundreds of $ per month unless you are located at a remote place in the middle of nowhere and have real excess energy availabe.


bad. One Antminer S17-50TH/s costs about 1500$ and will make you \~ 200$ per month for the next weeks IF you really have no power costs. Whoever pays for your power will have to pay about 185$ per month assuming power costs are at about US average of $0.12/kwh.

bitcoin is self regulatory and infrastructure agnostic. Current consent is a block size limit of 4WU. This runs fine on current infrastructure which is mainly the medium internet. If lets say a disaster happens and internet goes poof, people will start finding workarounds using black fiber, local mesh networks, satellite uplinks, long wave radio, etc pp. Miners will keep on mining at current consensus rules, but lets say a miner sees his 4WU blocks being orphaned often because they don't propagate fast enough and other miners frequently build on other blocks and he is basically losing money. In that case he will gradually lower the size of blocks he emits until he found an equilibrium where he pockets most transaction fees and his blocks are small enough to propagate fast enough and not being orphaned. This could be 100kb. or 500 or 50 and will adapt because the underlying infrastructure changes.
@_date: 2019-06-15 12:24:40


No. miner will put the set of transactions into a block, which pays the most fee per vbyte. That is an important difference.  What you personally could do is take precautions to make your transaction as small as possible so you can afford to pay enough sat per vbyte while still not paying much, because your transaction does not use many vbytes in the first place.
A common user can do 2 things to shrink his transactions size pretty easy:
1. consolidate your UTXOs. every time you transfer some btc to your wallet, a UTXO is created. lets say you did this 3 times. then you create a transaction to send all your btc somewhere. the transaction will look like this:`(UTXO1+UTXO2+UTXO3) -&gt; UTXO4`  
The number of UTXOs involved is  what makes your transaction big or small. So when you consolidate your UTXOS in times of low fees at 1sat/vbyte (the lowest fee possible in BTC) by simply spending all your UTXOS into a new one, then you can create very small transactions which look like this in times of high fees:  
`UTXO4 -&gt; UTXO5`  
which will stay relatively cheap because of their size.
2. Use bech32. Bech32 is a segwit native address. segwit transactions get an extra discount in block space usage and fee calculation to promote usage. to be more specific, you can put 4 bytes into 1 vbyte in specific parts of transactions (the segregated witness part, thats why its called segwit) . So segwit makes your transactions use  (=pay for) even less vbytes.
tl;dr: move all your funds to a single UTXO when fees a low from time to time and use Bech32.

sorry, my post was not meant to be offensive. english is not my first language, most probably I got some subtle nuances wrong. But back to topic: yes, this approach would work fine for most airdrops out there. In the most simplest form the user would share private keys of a (hopefully empty) wallet and a valid address where to sent his free bitcoins to and the site would do everything in the background: check what alts the key can claim, do the claiming, exchange alts for btc on an exxchange and finally sent btc back to the user.

don't calculate in "rigs"because there is no single rig. Calculate in exahash/sec. so b = cost of 1EH/s for 10min and n is the number of EH/s you need to attack (around 50 currently)
That said,  this is going to be purely theoretical yes? Because mining hardware is a rare good. basically every miner which is somewhat capable of mining bitcoin is mining already and you can't just buy more. All you can do is bribe miners to let you command their existing fleet or make a deal with bitmain et al to buy all of their mining hardware for the next year or so which won't go unnoticed.

never claimed some altcoins? what the altcoin devs do is either take a blockchain snapshot at a specific block or the fork at a specific block. All the user needs to do is transfer bitcoins to a different wallet _after_ this block. Then you can share you private keys of the now empty old wallet which contained BTC at the time of fork or snapshot.
However, i think that won't work with GBYTE airdrops because you need to claim before snapshot is taken but still, maybe someone will have a clever idea how to automate this process.

1. no one is going into BTC for 20% gains. You go in to HODL or to buy stuff with BTC. 
2. You should specify which country you are from or ask you question directly in a channel for this country's users. I for one pay 0% tax when I can proof that I own that BTC for over a year which is easy via blockchain. 
3. capital gains taxes are not that much, 20% in most areas of the world. thats $40 in your example. simply wait for your gains to be 250 and not 200 when you pay out and you are good to go.

mining is a risky business and not "essentially free". Minig 1 BTC costs slightly less then 1 BTC if, and only if you somehow made great deal on power and build facilities at remote locations with excess electricity.Operating costs force miners to sell most or all of their mined BTC to stay afloat and this is how BTC is distributed.

Lets say a big block needs a minute to propagate so all of the network is aware of this block, then the following happens: The miner which mined the block, has a one minute head start on mining the next block because he knows first that it was mined. In the mean time other miners were still mining the old blocks and eventually succeeded. now there are multiple chain heads which different miners mine on simultanously and all are valid until more blocks are mined on the different heads and one chain wins because it is the longest. 
The chain the biggest miner mined on will win usually because the biggest miner can build upon his own blocks the fastest which grants him an unfair advantage and most profits so he can invest more into hardware and mining is centralising even more.
That is basically what happened on BSV the other day. 2 blocks were mined at roughly the same time and propagated from 2 sides of the network. then 2 other blocks were mined on one side and nodes started to reorg to the other chain and while they were reorging the miners which were unaware somehow managed to mine 5 blocks in a row which made the other chain the longest again and everyone again reorged to their chain head. so basically while code worked as expected users saw confirmations of their transaction vanish and reappear again and the best interconnected and most powerful group of miners won 6 block rewards.

I'm sure you can do the math! hint: its 1008\*10min
@_date: 2019-04-29 10:16:06
yes. But it will be hard to fund upgrades if the bigger miner earns more then he should judging by pure hashrate and can upgrade faster to keep his advantage. The only winning move is offer to merge so they both have an even bigger piece of pie and even more profit for both. and this way you end up with one miner only.

You miss an important point here: incentives. A business does what a business does: Generating revenue. Implementing transaction batching costs money. Implementing intelligent UTXO management costs money. Implementing segwit costs money. We needed the pressure of high fees so their calculculations resulted in that its cheaper to invest into devs now which implement batching, UTXO mgmnt and segwit then paying high fees forever and risk that their customers move away and now everybody profits. If the blocksize had been raised significantly and fees went down, they simply would have had no incentive to implement this stuff.
Don't forget bitcoin is the frontier. Progress is painful. Newer coins will get batching &amp; other blockchain utilisation optimisation for free because BTC handling code will be reused. New businesses will start with optimised blockchain utilisation because thats the standard now and devs know best practise approaches how to implement it. 
Many other painful fights are to come on the way to world wide cryptocurrency adoption, because bitcoin is paving the way altcoins walk on.

when a new block arrives a miner will download &amp; validate it first, throw out all mined transactions from mempool and  create a set of transaction which will go to the next block if he mines it successfully. this actions need some time to complete. but its more profitable for a miner to start mining on a block immediately and from time to time a block is found faster then validation of prior block is completed and an empty block is broadcasted to pocket the coinbase btc.

Predicting fees is not as easy as you think because future is future. I think electrum will have a very sophisticated fee estimator in next release iirc. But how about a transaction fee minimizing tool: you use it to make a transaction. It automatically sets a low fee, eg 75% of the lowest fee of last block. Then one block later if transaction was not confirmed, it raises the fee a little via RBF and waits for another block. This keeps going until transaction finally confirmes et voila - you made a pretty cheap transaction .

First of all: Cryptocurrencies are extremely high risk investments. Whoever invests more fiat that he can afford to lose completely is an idiot. period. 
Second, people often don't understand what HODLING means. I already watched bitcoin lose 70-80% of its fiat value for 2 years in 2014 and 2015 and bought more from time to time while it was tanking. In times of ATH I solde a fraction to buy nice things like cars and holidays, as a REWARD for taking the RISK of HODLING. 
That game won't go on for ever, thats for sure. But it can go on for years, up to the moon and down the drain. Patience is key. And the key to patience is that you never invested so much money of yours, that you are forced to pull out when the price is low.

After the RFC is finished everybody starts building their nodes, test nets go online where devs and users test functionality and interoperability and as the software matures it enters main net eventually. BOLT 1.0 is the current specification and people are working on BOLT 1.1 for the next iteration. Check the BOLT RFC repo:

You can spend unconfirmed utxos no problem, but the child transaction won't confirm until parent is confirmed. This allows a technique called cpfp (child pays for parent) to speed up transaction confirmation. If you set a big fee for child transaction a miner will mine the low fee parent as well because otherwise he won't be able to confirm child and get the fee.

I disagree (mostly) :)What bitcoin core uses its cache for when syncing is holding utxo entries because it has to check every transaction in the block whether its inputs exist and are spendable or not. If utxo is in cache the lookup is fast, if its not in cache the node looks into utxo db on disk. but notice: every utxo is spendable exactly once and is then marked as spent and basically of no use anymore. if you have much ram available and assigned for caching you are king: newly created utxos are put into ram, found in ram later on when referenced in subsequent block and marked as spent. this is blazing fast. Sadly the raspberry only has 1GB of ram. If no swap is used, there is about 360MB of cache available. this cache builds up while blocks are consumed and is synced back to disk and emptied once full and starts filling up again. If you assign a swap file and increase cache size not much changes: ram access is still fast and when ram is full and swap is used utxo lookups will still be slow because they go to disk, only inside the swap file this time and not in the leveldb file - no big difference, other then you have sometimes 2 slow disk loopkups: first in swap, second in db file. And if the cache is full or the node is shutting down still everything will be synced to leveldb file, only this time the stuff will be copied from ram+disk(swap) to disk. so the copying will be much less frequent but take way longer - no real win here.So while reserving some swap for bitcoin core could looking like it makes syncing process faster it really does not. however, having some swap on the pi is still a good idea: when the bitcoin daemon runs and occupies 800MB of ram, there is only 160MB left for everything else and if the system needs more for other processes everything comes to a halt and kernel starts killing processes which will be the bitcoin client in most cases because its the biggest memory hog. Eg I'm not able to compile a new version of bitcoin core while running the current one - if there was some swap available thing would not run faster but I could do more things at once at the costs of some swapping induced performance hits. So I'm looking into somehow resizing the btrfs partition by a few GB and creating some swap :)

update your PC for faster sync. An SSD sped things up extremely for me. only about 2 days for a complete sync. 
That said you can export your private keys and import them into electrum, this way you gain full access instantly. Then create a new electrum wallet and transfer all your btc to the new address.
Then download and install Electron. Thats a bcash fork of electrum. import your OLD keys of the now empty BTC wallet and your BCH will show up. 
There are many other forks to claim which forked like bcash did. I'd dump them fast because they are all losing value. Here is a overview:

There is no  major flaw in Bitcoin design. that title is stupid. However, when you are your own bank then you are your own bank and have to sue if someone, in this case bitkassa, robs you.
I'm ordering stuff world wide all the time paying with paypal. If a shop does not deliver, delivers the wrong stuff, customs won't release it, does not answer my emails or whatever, I go to paypals website and get my money back. this is a strong incentive for shops not to fuck around, because paypal will pull my money without hesitating. 
If BTC is going to be the mainstream currency for the web we'll need a paypal of some kind I'm afraid. I'd glad pay a small fee to be sure I can always get my money back if a shop from the other side of globe is going to misbehave, because I for sure won't sue someone in another country for a few bucks.

First of all: Cryptocurrencies are extremely high risk investments. Whoever invests more fiat that he can afford to lose completely is an idiot. period. 
Second, people often don't understand what HODLING means. I already watched bitcoin lose 70-80% of its fiat value for 2 years in 2014 and 2015 and bought more from time to time while it was tanking. In times of ATH I solde a fraction to buy nice things like cars and holidays, as a REWARD for taking the RISK of HODLING. 
That game won't go on for ever, thats for sure. But it can go on for years, up to the moon and down the drain. Patience is key. And the key to patience is that you never invested so much money of yours, that you are forced to pull out when the price is low.

You are right, so here it goes:
Imagine there is a bus coming to your bus stop exactly every ten minutes. You know bus is coming often and when ever you wanna go to the city you simply go to the stop and wait. you'll wait almost 10min max if you missed it shortly or you'll have to wait 0 minutes when the bus comes exactly when you arrive as well. Because the times at which you arrive are random, the times you will have waited over the years will be distributed evenly from 0-10min with an arithmetic mean of 5min.
Now lets assume the bus will be sometimes late and sometimes early. That will change? not that much, you will wait longer then 10 minutes sometimes and sometimes you'll catch the bus you would have missed if it was on time. As long as there are not fewer or more busses in a day, or a week or whatever your reference timeframe is and their distribution is equally random, youe average waiting time will still be 5min. 
That is not true anymore if bus distribution changes: eg if busses tend to arrive in groups: eg if 6 busses tend arrive at the beginning of each hour and then no bus for the rest of the hour. Then you mean waiting time will be 30min, because distribution of events changed. Thats not true for mining. The probability to hit the desired hash format and mine a block is equal for every hash process.  Ideally at least. There are block propagation issues n' stuff we'll fade-out for now.

If you really managed to lose 71% of your money in a market which went up continously for the last few years, there is only one advise for you: DO NOT TRADE. 
Buy half a coin for your 2.9k$, put it into a paper wallet and put it away to a safe place which is far away and complicated to get, just in case you get the idea of start trading again. 
Then just HODL. Watch BTC charts not more then 4 times a year, not more often because then you will get the idea of start trading again and check how your investment worked out 10 years later.

What makes you think that blocksize increase would solve anything? Transaction count drops currently because full blocks and high fees produced enough pressure on stakeholders to finally optimize their transaction strategies which benefits everyone.

It would increase transaction capacity, but it would not _solve_ anything. Afaik there are no technical reasons preventing going 2mb other then more network load on the nodes. Current status is: transacions are fast and cheap, no need to increase size. only in times when someone is spamming the mempool we get in trouble. The same guys could spam 2mb blocks as well - so nothing would change.

about the dropping after few days. are you sure? I had a low fee transaction for over a week in the mempool once and googled whether there is a max age after they are dropped and found out there is not. Bad info?
About RBF: This can be switched off so the user has no way of modifying the transaction once its in the pool. So wallet apps could have 2 buttons: "Fastpay" with RBF off for zero conf transactions like buying a coffee or whatever and "Secure Pay" for bigger purchases with RBF and waiting for confirmation..

Why for heavens sake should I first draw a few thousand euros from a normal ATM, run with that money in my purse through thecity only to insert it into a btc atm? makes no sense. even for small buings. maybe if one lives in a 3rd world country, does not own a bank account or whatever, but for the usual citizen of a western country this is pointless. Everyone will do it exactly 1 time just to make a selfie posting "wow i got btc at an atm!!11" to facebook...

the downside is that this would destroy bitcoins main value proposition, the chain would split into the censored and the real one and the censored one would die. you should not assume no one thought of this before you. people did for years and no state pulls this off because bitcoin is antifragile and censoring does not work.

if you don't want to spend now then let it sit where it is, its perfectly safe. All you need to do is backup the private keys eg by writing them down and storing this piece on paper in a safe place, just in case your old laptop won'T wake up when you need it.   
If you want to transfer all you have into a new wallet then install Electrum from [ to your new pc and create a wallet. Then you can do it in 2 ways:
* use electrum's sweep function (Menu Wallet -&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Sweep) to transfer everything from your old addresses to the new wallet. You need the old wallets priovate keys for that.
* Let your old laptops wallet software fully sync up and transfer everything to the address of your new electrum wallet.

The idea behind LN is that it can, will and should be somewhat centralised, because thats the whole point of making it magnitudes more efficient then on chain transactions. 
Its a layer _on top_ of bitcoin, designed for frequent &amp; small transactions. Should it go down the drain due to centralisation, bad actors or simply not working as intended, people can leave it and fall back to transfer on-chain or build a better alternative. 
Thats so nice about layers: if one breaks you have still a fallback beneath. And thats why its crucial that the lowest layer is bulletproof, decentralised, permissionless and secure, while the others can concentrate on to usability, speed and convenience.

you are describing bitcoin at its beginings. Every node was a miner as well, blockchain was small so everyone held it completely. 
Nowadays mining nodes are still the purest definition of node in a peer2peer electronic cash system. But today you can choose freely: Don't wanna use power? don't mine, but validate only. Don't want to spent your disc space? run a pruned node which only holds a fraction of the blockchain. Don't wanna validate? Run a light wallet. 
You see - its currently all you described and more :)

It could work this way but I honestly think it won't for the average joe. 
I think the average user will have a bank account and the bank will manage 95% of his finances for him.
It will receive his wage, pay his bills, will manage his private keys and banks will have agreed on refund rules and costs of service. Eg that a transfers are reverseable for 2 weeks or so because people make mistakes from time or try to cheat each other. 
All the customer will do is fill up his (lightning) wallet from time to time to have some cash at hand. 
However, this is pure convenience and fine by me - the revolution is that whoever does not want or is not able to get a bank account can still participate by utilising blockchain and/or lightning directly. 
EDIT: I forgot to mention... What I call "bank" in my post could be pure software, eg a dapp, no humans involved.

Can you think of an alternative priorisation algorithm?how miners select transactions into a block is no consensus rule, they can basically do whatever they want and change it at any time. However, including transactions which pay most gives the miner most revenue thus is the preferred way. 
IIRC correctly there once was a compatible node implementation called Bitcoin Unlimited which allowed a few 0 sat transactions to be included in a block for fun, so people could broadcast a feeless transaction and wait for a few days and weeks and it was included eventually with a bit of luck. However, Bitcoin Unlimited is no more on BTC and current node implementations don't do that  anymore by default. It was just a fun lottery style setting and basically lost miner revenue for the kicks.

It does not matter how much it is worth next week or yesterday.what matters is how much it is wort at the point in time you bought something. I bought xtc pills for 1 btc per pill a few years ago and a car for \~2 btc last year.

makes no sense for you - but for me. Im at average 113€ buying price per BTC right now which is \~150$. Doesn't want to raise it to much buy buying more for thousands and made 500 my personal limit so average price won't go above 200.

Thats a valid point. I synced the blockchain successfully on my laptop in 2 days last year but I'm not in a hurry. that lil pi is already at 30gb of blockchain. Only problem is that with 200mb of cache he's running at 850mb of its 950mb of ram and I'm afraid I'll have to lower it more if he starts exceeding available ram which will slow him down even more. However, it currently looks like he could finish before 2019 at current rate

Never thought about this because in my nativae language (german) there is a simple rule: If a word is a composition of two words eg. Bit and Coin ;) its simply pluralised by pluralising the last component, so Bitcoins it is :) But english runs on different rules I guess\^\^

How long his node took I don't know. most guides tell the user to sync on his desktop device and copy everything over to the pi, however I went the full sync pi route. Its running for a week now and is at 48% currently (nov 2016 blocks)

Im pretty sure there are less then 1000 people which understand bitcoin in the world. however, there are a many people which have a simplistic view of some dumbed down concepts of crypto currencies and think they understand it.There is a simple test to check if one has a basic understand of how bitcoin works: ask him what a transaction looks like.

this is a fallacy called suvivorship bias: [ don't see the tons of people which invested in new and exciting technology which failed. you only see the few guys which by luck invested in the few techs which survived. you dad runs a low risk strategy which is the most successfull in the long term for not unusual lucky people.

this post ist somewhat overly dramatic as 10% difficulty jumps are not that uncommon but still roughly right. We are in times of an empty mempool for the last few days, its the perfect time to open/close LN channels, consolidate utxos, finally mote segwit etc pp because you can use 1sat/b fees.

I can't recommend the fork claimer script enough: [
It's so simple that one can audit it and all following commits easily. And its one tool for 90% of forks.

nope I have not and I've no plans to read it, have currently a way to high stack of other must-reads at my desk :/However, I'm in bitcoin since 2013, I've a master in computer science, and am working on a command line client currently which will realise dynamic fees for duration-to-confirmation constrained transactions in my spare time.However, I still feel I truly understand only about 90% of bitcoin and always am bewildered how fast people tend to claim they understand a topic while they clearly do not.Maybe its simply the language barrier but isn'T there a big difference between truly understanding something and grasping a concept?

Profit from their children. The more descendants you have the higher is the chance that at least one of them gets a decent job or criminal career without being catched or gets some money by pure luck so you can live of his income.
Because people tend to support their elder parents. This is the survival strategy of most humans for the last 300k years

I'd love if someone does the math how big blockspace usage difference is if you use splice-outs/splice-ins for  transfers compared to simple 1-in-2-out bech32 transfers and normal channel openings. splicing transactions should be bigger but by how much? I'm not smart enough to calculate myself :/

not really. there is a new checkpoint every block. it always the tenth block from the current tip of the chain.   
You can't call it PoS beyond block 10. there is simply no reorg possible deeper then 10 blocks.

its great indeed.However, i'd like to change 2 things. FIrst I'd love to being able to use it eerywhere on reddit, nut just r/bitcoin. Second I'd like to being able to tip less then 10sat. IIRC tips of 0.01sat should be doable via lightning. I know this makes not really sense but ell why not just tip someone 0.01sat just for kicks :)

in the early days bitcoin people not even had addresses\^\^ I'm not joking, really old transactions are of type p2pk (pay2pubkey), which means transaction adressed directly the public keys of receivers, which is way easier to correlate analytically then todays fancy key-/script-/segwitprogram hash addressing schemes.
