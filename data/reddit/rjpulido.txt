I agree, but is undoubtedly the "face" to many. It has long been the de facto price index.

Thank you for the genuine response.
Anyone have any idea on current MtGox verification times?
I'm only at 5 business days so no complaints yet.

I understand its not an exchange, I'm not trying to buy and sell, just buy and hold. And when you can only have one pending transaction at a time, you need to pick you buys carefully. I only have AMEX, so no instant buy for me.

Besides increase in value to USD, how does one guarantee 6% monthly interest. Bitcoin is a currency, it does not erase the fundamentals of investing and capitol gain.

Not sure if you read all of this, this fund did not "invest is BTC" as part of its portfolio, its only asset is BTC. This is just a way to scam an annual management fee of 1.75%, as well as a 0.5 % transaction fee from investors too lazy / scared / ignorant to buy their own BTC on an exchange.

Can you explain this in detail a little more. In the past when coinbase buy price hits a price I like, I press buy and even though it takes a few days I get it at the price quoted at the time I hit buy.
Maybe I should clarify, I tried to buy when coinbase said 658.XX not the very bottom. Not sure if that matters.
