If you're a child and can't discern for yourself who to trust that's fine. Just don't force us all to be children of the regulatory bureaucrats.

Been silently wishing for this to happen because this is clearly the next step for bitcoin. This could be huge. Why not use it even if sitting on bitcoins for investment, now that bit-coins can be automatically replenished through coinbase. My biggest problem with spending bitcoins is the thought of exchanging bitcoins for anything that's not crypto-currency.
I hope this explodes so that people, consumers, will have more incentive to adopt, thus increasing the disruptiveness, making government take action, then raising more awareness. What's gonna happen?!

I sent bitcoins to an account that i had been "watching" and the money was debited but under the transactions tab there is the sign "Moved between wallet" and a 0.00 under "amount."
