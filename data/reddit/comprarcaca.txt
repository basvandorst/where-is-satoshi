Thin clients don't need to download full blocks already by requesting relevant txs only using bloom filters. So for full nodes in particular, isn't this increasing the bandwidth usage the same way it would by directly increasing block size?

Not correct, the average block size is still around 600KB. Fees have to be incremented until miners fill up all blocks instead of mining empty blocks from time to time.

I think it's in human nature to think first negatively about other's intentions, just in case. Maybe happens that is more useful to catch a negative behaviour early than a positive one (perhaps is related to self-defence) and sometimes we may stay with that initial feeling. If you think about how fast bad news spread in contrast to good news, there is really a difference. As you suggested, non-verbal communication lacks a ton of information that usually removes uncertainty from the message we want to deliver.

@_date: 2015-12-12 20:14:02
The block limit is there to prevent transaction spam, a fee market develops naturally from this constraint, it's not politics but a healthy scaling strategy. If blockspace wasn't highly limited, the most capable miners will drive others out of business, increasing centralization in a feedback loop while not rising transaction rates substantially.

The fact that there isn't a direct and clear answer to 'who decides what bitcoin is' is one of the strong features of bitcoin, so it can naturally become what the parties incentivised by it want it to be. Currently we don't have only bitcoin core, there are other alternative bitcoin implementations (I use btcd for example) which are as valid as core and understand what technical consensus is (what works, what not, what is not proven to work or lacks enough evidence), this is imho a superior way of organising ourselves than politics (even when pockets of politics surge around naturally because we're humans). Discussion is good and I'm sorry if I thought you were part of the continuous trolling I see around this sub, but still, we need more data than proposals, more proposals than discussion, more discussion than just ideas.

From the paper:

@_date: 2015-12-28 07:46:16
First of all, I never said channels are meant to be open forever but relationships between lightning nodes (people will in average keep opening channels with the same set of nodes). You maybe haven't heard about but segwit is gonna get activated before lightning is deployed so the blockspace will be incremented at that point, and it will be incremented further probably after the halvening (but I say this based on my own estimation). When you say you can lose the money locked in a channel because 'a hub gets hacked' you demonstrate you have no idea what you're talking about or why lightning is important at all. Thanks for trying though.
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:46:07
I'm sorry to burst your bubble but the power structures in our world may not work as you think they do, the dollar is not the sole world currency anymore and bitcoin actually had nothing to do with that.
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:20:53
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:19:20
Yeah I skipped that part because I think a network of relationships between participants will emerge really quick and its only then when it gets interesting to me in economic terms. Regarding the bootstrapping phase, it may be true that it could be disturbed if tx volume raises too quickly though.

@_date: 2015-12-28 06:36:46
I think he means in the hypothetical case that blockspace increments can't keep up with tx volume. I think it's more or less obvious for everybody that the blocksize limit will be incremented (probably after the halvening) in small steps until a proper formula is found.

I don't know what that has to do with the fact that miners pick the mining strategy that suit them better. Empty blocks will be produced when the benefit of including txs minus the cost (high orphan rate) of doing so is less than the cost of producing an empty block with low orphan rate. I'm sure many of those 12k tx have very low fees so there is no incentive to include them.

No, miners chose to mine empty blocks to lower their orphan rate (the possibility that a mined block is rejected, one reason is because bigger blocks propagate slower). Only if fees were big enough to compensate orphan rates then maybe miners would not do this at all, but that wouldn't be solved alone by just having unlimited blocks because, much more transactions at current fee prices will still be required to incentivise miners (and tx volume is not going to increase magically by just allowing bigger blocks).

If you don't lose funds I don't see the attack vector created by 'not playing by the rules'. The expiration time should be chosen accordingly to the settlement transaction fee.

@_date: 2015-05-21 15:19:40
You could do it the same way, pick manually from the longest chain a random block and hardcode it in the code, then sync from there. The issue here is that some transactions could have UTXOs that you don't know/cannot prove they exist without consulting other nodes (thus making this as secure as SPV).
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:10:24


We don't know how much power this chip consumes so that is pure speculation. 


Software must be installed, configured and maintained while these devices can be used right away.
Anyway, I'm just guessing like everybody else, let's just wait for more details.

I'm interested, where are you shipping from and how much  they weight?
@_date: 2015-05-14 02:19:46
100 bits
@_date: 2015-05-21 11:58:48
You can in theory use any other block as the genesis block (the genesis block is just hardcoded in the code), the problem arises when validating mined blocks (as I understand you don't have all the UTXOs). If you have all the UTXOs but not the blockchain then the solution is not better than SPV. In resume, you must have proof that all UTXOs are valid to have some security when you receive payments.

Heard about batteries? Jokes apart, what this provides is convenience, auto-recharging is superior to manual recharging. Think of this as convenient micro solar panels for smart contracts. It's about the value of tokens in the protocol, not the tokens monetary value.

Yes, I thought about it twice and you're right, my proposal will unnecessarily make multiple recipient payments hard to make (requiring multiple txs, which is worst than what we have now). Now I think your solution is the most elegant, perhaps in combination with stealth addresses.

I think he means the bitcoin "ecosystem", not the natural environment.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:01:14


I meant batteries existed when those calculators were made (lasting for years) and still they put solar panels, it's about convenience not cost.


In the IoT world, were you have many devices requiring tokens, replenishment itself takes resources and setup.


It's too soon to talk about what will be the use cases of this but I guess the monetary value (and thus the quantity) of the bitcoin mined is not really relevant.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:52:18

Depends on what do you mean by "stable". BitMessage uses its own p2p network so it needs specialised nodes. Using testnet for messaging increases the transaction volume which can be useful to test some aspects of the network.

That's mass-deployment, production and consumption are definitely different things.


That's what I was referring to, you cannot produce creative ideas at massive scales.


There are issues, this one is out of scope but nonetheless the field is a mess in other aspects, there's way too much fragmentation, unnecessary redundancy, dependency hell, bit rot, etc. Every giant  has their own set of problems, the number of engineers these companies employ and dedicate exclusively to fix issues is staggering.
@_date: 2015-09-27 03:28:06
I think the discrepancy may come from the specific definition of 'miner'. I think what you mean is this device is not producing more value in BTC than you spend in USD (energy) so not mining for profit. We can agree on that. Having that clear, mining for keeping the device loaded with a small amount of satoshis is a feature of this device and is what the buyer expects from it. 21 has not yet announced the possibility of loading BTC manually (that I know) so that's pure speculation. 
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:16:41
I was being sarcastic, obviously it doesn't minify (and also doesn't obfuscate very well). The sole idea of mass-produced software is plain wrong, software development is much closer to research than production, you cannot have mass-research, the field is just expanding as we work on it.
@_date: 2015-09-27 02:38:41

Again, you're looking at the finger. These may be failures, but right next to them, in the same category there are successes too. My example was an analogy, and like every analogy, it's not perfect. It was about human technology in general terms, and how bad we are when it comes to predict how it will be in the next 15 years.

There is a tradeoff between block sizes and orphaning rate. If fees don't add up above certain threshold, miners can be incentivised to produce tiny blocks to gain advantage on propagation time.

Nope, realistically it would be hidden on rubbish or trees, if you found a locked box somewhere you would definitely pick it up and force it, the best place to hide is in plain sight. And there are not that much hoops: goods are listed, searched and found, bought, dropped and picked up.

Facebook usage is not a unified "movement", just mass-consumption, those billion users are not interacting to each other in a novel way (there is very little interaction between strangers, apart of the occasional upvotes). You talk about "users communicating across borders" like there wasn't international communication before Facebook. In fact, Facebook has currently contributed to our society more technologically (some advances in web technologies and  software deployment practices) than socially (no long-lasting revolutions, no amazing ideas spawned from facebook).

I suppose this can hardly be used to sell big quantities of anything, the smaller the payload the safer the delivery. But anyway, framing vendors is extremely hard if they do things correctly in the btc funds management side.
About small metropolitan areas and that, I agree this is not helping, but in the future medium-distance drone deliveries may be a thing.
On a different note, dropzone is mainly a marketplace for information. One of its first practical applications is geocached deliveries for illicit goods but it will not stop there.

How it can be safer when you have to interact directly with somebody to get your goods.
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:19:48
Nobody has to go anywhere but the buyer, sellers of illicit goods already depend on vast delivery networks. This is just seller privacy protection (from competing sellers as well), it doesn't aim to improve the delivery issue, that's up to the seller and will always be, because you know, illicit goods.

You're missing that email wasn't widely adopted since the beginning not because nobody needed fast international messaging, but because virtually nobody had a computer to send them in first place (in fact those who had access used email heavily). When bitcoin came we all had computers and phones, and since there are phone and online wallets bitcoin is easily accessible to anybody. You're confusing the reasons people have to use something with the means to do it. Bitcoin still has to provide an obvious reason to the masses, and that has to come out of a need.

There is no need for bitcoin to go mainstream yet, just to be used in closed production/consumption circuits. The network grows in value when bitcoins are transacted, conversion to fiat just pauses this growth. Killer apps should then emerge from closed bitcoin economies.

All the high end spectrum requires maintenance and has elevated costs associated, there is no point using it for sending transactions (that require bitcoin to be spent in fees as well) when it can be used to mine blocks for profit. Transactions made by the low end should be only delayed by a couple seconds at most. Bitmessage doesn't require value to be transferred so the comparison is pointless.
@_date: 2015-03-09 00:16:43
I installed it when I was a kid with no difficulties. You made your point but the early world wide web was conceptually very different to bitcoin, in fact you can just compare them in terms of their network effect.

Very utopic in fact. We might get consensus on a set of rules but there will never be a system that is at the same time efficient and results in equality all the time via collaboration, the incentive is not strong enough. The pure open-source based economy is a myth.

You cannot predict how "hard" things will be for future generations, many have tried before and failed. Instead of that, I can just predict blockchain technology will drive us to a real global society, and perhaps slowly, but for sure there is no going back.

Internet was pretty usable in 1995. 
In fact we didn't have to know about any underlying protocol, I certainly was 9 years old and I was using it with no issues. I don't think the issue with bitcoin is the complexity of its protocol, but the risk of losing value if no proper security measures are taken.

It is not, is just another form of illicit goods delivering.


But it does that, it is intended for asynchronous delivery; as in the seller hides the goods somewhere, saves the location, creates the listing, somebody buys it and goes to the location to pick it up. It doesn't really needs personal interaction at all.


Read above. This is seller privacy protection, if he uses random drops there is no way to compromise him.

Every time a coinbase user "sends" another coinbase user bitcoins there is no real bitcoin transaction performed (coinbase does it's own internal real bitcoin transactions for other reasons than assigning bitcoins to another account), just a database update which cannot really qualify as a bitcoin transaction, mostly because it doesn't have any of the features for what bitcoin was invented in first place (prevent double spending, decentralized consensus). Counterparty just uses colored bitcoins, which in other words it's like calling your dollars magic notes, which is fine, but that doesn't make them stop being dollars.
