I was a Bitcoin Trumper... I choose Bitcoin. Fuck this guy.

Well, bitcoin's value comes from distributed trust and belief in the system. So let's look at the two scenarios.
1) Code is implemented to block Satoshi's wallet. A precedent is set that the Core devs can stop people from freely using their own money, and trust in bitcoin is lost.
2) The Satoshi coins move, people realise the value will probably dump hard, and trust in bitcoin is lost (briefly) since it's only the price that is affected and not the underlying fundamentals.
One is more dangerous than the other.

Lmfao this is good.

Ohh interesting. Didn't know that the bonus being there was considered skill. I thought the 99% luck 1% skill thing was just an advertising maxim. Thanks!

Even bustabit v2 fits that criteria if I'm not mistaken

Was expecting a picture of a pizza with cocaine and strippers on it. Disappointed.
@_date: 2018-10-29 10:55:47
Agreed... it's pretty stupid. They're just selling a less functional and less secure Nano S at a higher price. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:33:10
There are several bots out there that monitor and/or scan for weak private keys, or simply keep them in their wallets. The moment a transaction appears, they are programmed to sweep them into a wallet owned by the bot (which, naturally, does not have a weak private key). 
The "transaction in the same block" thing can happen regardless of whether the private key is weak or strong; it's possible with any bitcoin address. Unconfirmed inputs can be spent!

Do you have a source for this? I've been using blockchain.info for a long time and it would be a horrible shame if Ver actually owns it... would have to switch to something better.

For people such as myself who are a part of communities that use bitcoin to transact on a daily basis, by far, the most popular denomination is bits. 2000 bits for a meal, 20,000 bits for a new phone, 200k bits for this month's rent. Works for smaller things too, like 50 bits for a stick of gum. It's far more intuitive. Sats is wayyyy too small to use at $1mm per coin, let alone now
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:07:59
Bits is way better

.24 isn't much. You'll make it back
@_date: 2018-10-21 07:35:45
Stupid because most miners don't immediately sell all their coins.
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:57:27
This is a scam to steal your BTC. Watch out.
@_date: 2018-10-16 08:59:58
Yeah, I was surprised too. I posted a private key as a joke in a chat box, since a few dollars of BTC was being sent there, and was unconfirmed. To my surprise, a few seconds later, a transaction was created moving the BTC out, even though the first transaction hadn't confirmed yet. The moment the block hit, both transactions simultaneously got a confirmation.
@_date: 2018-10-15 23:04:47
It's basically spending an unconfirmed transaction with a high fee, thus it can be included in the same block. Totally possible.

ColdCard shills out in full force. Use Trezor or Ledger. Either is fine.

Sorry, that was a typo. I tried spending 0.003 as well as 0.001, nothing worked

Dude, you got busted. You literally posted fake fucking screenshots. You did illegal shit, it's over. Stop whining.

Well, to be fair, they do own Poloniex now.

Mixing is a thing.
So no.
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:13:55
Yeah this is perfect.

Stocks too are nearing yearly lows LOL

In all honesty it was a lucky guess... I use Mullvad too xD Great choice
@_date: 2019-01-06 23:49:04
I can see your payment to MullvadVPN.

Can't believe only one redditor caught him out.
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:07:54
It's undeniable that he did something that can definitely be seen as punishable in most jurisdictions, but the fact of the matter is that, as you said, there were no victims. He himself did nothing that caused harm to other human beings. I think the time he has served is enough, and he should be let free.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:36:38
Oh yeah nice catch
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:00:57
Correct, it's impossible to counterfeit coins on the Bitcoin network. It's also impossible to spend the same set of coins more than once (double-spending). Both are pretty easy with gold.
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:04:06
You mean society and the legal system punishing sociopathic frauds
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:30:49
"it's impossible to counterfeit coins on the Bitcoin network" is what I said. That's pretty correct.
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:10:50
Not a valid argument at all since past performance does not indicate future results
@_date: 2019-09-21 06:58:12
There's an online tool called DeBitpay
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:06:30
You're completely right in this thread. Just keep in mind that most of these people are very emotionally attached to their (large) investments in bitcoin, so they don't really see straight.
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:18:30
If it truly is the bottom, how does it matter whether you bought at $3k or $4k? It's going to end up at five/six digits anyway...
