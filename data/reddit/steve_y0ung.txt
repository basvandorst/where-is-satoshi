I think the easiest way is to ask your friends and acquaintances if they need any, you can use social networks, for example. I believe it is the most effective way, also you don't have to pay any comissions. Of course, if we are not talking about large sums

Until recently, the blockchain was perceived as inseparable from Bitcoin, because this technology is the basis for the functioning of the first cryptocurrency. Without trying to diminish the value of Bitcoin, we can say that this technology can be used for much more important things than just digital money. Citizens do not feel the feedback from their governments, which contributes to the overall level of bureaucracy.

I believe people who buy superyachts do not worry about such things. First of all it is a status indicator of a person who does not count small expenses

Bitcoin has been blamed for high power consumption since its inception. Most critics are in no hurry to share their reasoning, sources and calculations, which is why it is rather difficult to confirm or refute their position.

There is some confusion in this matter, since people often imply two different things under Bitcoin. The first is what attracts the most attention to this concept: Bitcoin is a currency, a digital unit of value used by people to exchange goods, services or exchange for other currencies, the rate of which tends to be very fluctuating with respect to traditional banknotes issued by the government. But this narrow definition masks the second, broader and reflecting a much more serious property of Bitcoin, namely: Bitcoin is not just a currency, but also a technology. The essence of Bitcoin as a technology is that it is a system protocol - a widespread concept in programming, denoting a basic set of software instructions that allows computers to communicate with each other.
The Bitcoin protocol runs on a network of computers owned by many people in different parts of the world and supporting its blockchain and cash settlement system. The protocol contains instructions for computers, as well as information necessary for monitoring and verifying transactions between people in the Bitcoin economy. The system is based on an encryption technique that allows customers to use keys to send digital money directly to each other in the form of special passwords that should not be disclosed to outsiders. It is equally important that the protocol describes the steps that computers must perform in the system in order to confirm the reliability of certain transactions. As the consensus on this issue is reached, the addressee of the transfer receives a guarantee that the payer has sufficient funds for settlement, and the digital payment made by him is not fictitious.

I absolutely agree with you. It is just the beginning and this example proves us that cryptocurrency is gaining its momentum. I am sure that crypto will dramatically change the payment aspect of each industry

Do not worry, if you are in the beginning of investing you may have such experience, however you need to make a lot of effortin order to succeed and learn on your mistakes

Since the beginning of 2017, cryptocurrencies have grown faster than any other asset class, and perhaps the past year was a record for many investors. Bitcoin rose against the backdrop of a falling dollar, which is now very cheap compared to other world currencies. Trump probably likes the weak dollar because it increases the competitiveness of American industry, but it provides cash savings, so investors are not very happy. Before, when the dollar fell, they, trying to hedge, bought gold, but lately for many it was Bitcoin that took its place.
Why bitcoin? The fact is that the limit amount of bitcoins is limited to 21 million coins, that is, it is a finite resource, like gold. And given the growth last year, it was easy to convince investors to keep money in Bitcoin, and not in gold. In early January, when Bitcoin dropped sharply below $ 10,000 per coin, sales of gold and gold coins rose.
You can hear that Bitcoin and gold are similar, since they are both finite - gold mined and lying in the ground, this is all there is, there will be no new. The same with Bitcoin - there will be no more than 21 million coins.

Virtual money is still not able to exist separately from real money. Cryptocurrency cannot exist without dollars, without euro, without liquidity, without a stable opportunity to turn into ordinary money. We need to create standards for the cryptocurrency industry, ensure transparency of trade, fight manipulation of the exchange rate of digital currencies.

Bitcoin expects rapid growth, but you need to wait a bit. There will not be a grand change in the price of Bitcoin, until the international investors enter the market. I believe that in 2019, if capital goes into the digital industry, we will see new highs. We did not expect it, but the process will take longer. Therefore, I do not see any prerequisites for the fact that Bitcoin this year will reach 10 thousand dollars

World government, the creators of cryptocurrency, criminal organizations and government agencies have launched a real struggle around the topic of anonymity cryptocurrency.
At the same time, ordinary users of Bitcoin and Altcoins, who simply seek to preserve privacy and protect their transactions from undue attention, are becoming victims of this struggle.
The original concept of Bitcoin, among other things, focused attention on its anonymity. However, the perception of this term by the world community was significantly different from the meaning invested by developers.
Rather, they just wanted to say that in order to carry out transactions, the user does not need to identify himself and can be limited to using a nickname.
At the same time, at the dawn of cryptoeconomics, criminal organizations perceived a statement of anonymity as an opportunity to simplify the implementation of illegal schemes, hackers as an additional way to make money, and ordinary users as a way to protect funds.

When organizing a referendum for autonomy by the Government of Catalonia, bitcoins were used to hide the participation of outside companies involved in it. I believe that's an obvious fact.
