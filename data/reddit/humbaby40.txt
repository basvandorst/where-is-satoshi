As of 10:12 AM EST GDAX price is $16,500 and Bitfinex is $15,299.  As Coinbase appears to buy and sell customer orders on GDAX, the US BTC ecosystem is causing a US centric price surge today.  Sorta like the South Korean market say a manic price surge yesterday.
If US residents could use Bitfinex, we wouldn't see such large price imbalances because we would buy it cheaper on that exchange.

If you believe BTC might revolutionize world finance, banking and payment processes forever, then its not too late to put in $500. 
If it goes bust, you lose $500.  If it changes the world forever, $500 in BTC now will stake you more BTC than 99.99% of everyone else on the planet.  Then in 10 years those people need to come to you for some BTC.

The reason all these crypto-exchanges have different pricing is they are in essence closed ecosystems where BTC price is being set by a pool of buyers and sellers that stay within their ecosystem.  Coinbase is predominately a US resident customer base and sends their orders to GDAX.  Since US residents cannot use Bitfinex, most of the buying action today for the US was routed to GDAX thus causing a pricing imbalance sending the BTC price much higher than Bitfinex.
There are also large price imbalances in the predominant exchanges people living in South Korean and Japan use for the same reason.  Since not all people can access all the same crypto-exchanges, these imbalances will continue as certain population bases restricted to one exchange provider or another surge into (and possibly out of) BTC.

Well deserved.  I was thinking that if anyone who is now a BTC millionaire because they were lucky enough to hear Andreas speak early on sent him 1% of their BTCs, that would be a fair reward.

Clearing is not "buying or selling" a futures contract.  It is confirming the price that two people agreed to do so in the market and logging that transaction between the two parties.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:07:23
- 1 BTC Futures contract will track 5 BTCs.
- 1 BTC Futures contract at this moment would be worth about $70,000 (5 *$14,000)
- Futures are bought and sold on margin with futures brokers that set the minimum money you need to put up to open a contract.  So instead of paying the full $70K, you might only pay $10 - 20K per futures contract depending on the broker.
- A Future is a contract, a buyer and seller are price matched in the market to open a contract.  One is long and one is short.  There are always an equal number of long and short contracts at any time.
- The futures contract is closed when the buyer sells the contract on the market again.  Likewise the seller of the contract closes the position when they buy it on the market to close their position.   
-Two US based exchanges will offer BTC futures in the next 10 days.  CBOE this Sunday night and CME the next Sunday night.

The futures markets can decrease volatility for BTC over the long term.  For this to happen the the CME futures markets will need to be the dominant price setter for BTC, not the crypto-exchanges.  
But how long will it take for that dominance to be asserted?  Not sure, but until it happens things could get even more wild in BTC world.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:46:30
It is a US based eco-system run on BTC caused by US resident Coinbase orders hitting the GDAX.  Bitfinex price is not moving the same.  US population can't easily buy using other exchanges, so its a local price push.  
Either the GDAX price will need to drop towards the Bitfinex price or the rest of the world freaks at the GDAX price surge and buys the hell out of Bitfinex to push its price to match GDAX.  Which exchange will move to meet the other?  No one knows.

Adam -
Quite simply Bitcoin could possibly forever change the world's financial, banking, and currency systems.  Whoever buys even a small amount of bitcoin feels they may be part of something revolutionary at its earliest moments.  
There is a feeling of excitement and hope for what this new financial world can be.  The emotions of excitement and hope that something good is going to happen are driving Bitcoin as much as the price rise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:34:58
The prices are different because each crypto-exchange essentially is a closed eco-system of buyers and sellers.  Pricing gets pushed around quasi independently by these exchange centric groups.
If the bid/ask prices from all exchanges were collected together on a master exchange like the NYSE or NASDAQ does for a stock listing, there would be a single worldwide BTC price.
But you are correct that if our current financial system allowed for immediate transfers between participants, arbitrage would eliminate these price spreads on different exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:21
Lack of a coordinated, single globally available exchange is causing GDAX BTC price to explode as the US population uses Coinbase to access the market.  The price surge is contained to the US BTC eco-system for now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:28:37
I usually see the coinbase price paired with the GDAX price.  As I type this GDAX is $15,617, while Bitfinex is $14,996.

If your friend used a bank ACH transfer to pay Coinbase for the BTC, it is taking about 7 days for Coinbase to put the BTC in exchange wallets now.  Most of the time is for the money to be transferred from a person's bank and then cleared at the exchange to confirm the transaction is "paid".
If the person bought the BTC with previously cleared money they are holding in their Coinbase account, it takes less time.  Not sure how long this type of buy takes as I have only done ACH payment with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:40
Correct.  Financial institutions cannot make their bets on BTC like us early adopters do on crypto-exchanges.  They must do so in a regulated environment, so the CBOE and CME created the Bitcoin futures so they can participate.  
My guess is they want to play the short side of BTC at some point, but may not do so at $15K.  They would probably rather short it at a much higher number - like $25K??

The higher BTC rises in value, hacking crypto-exchanges becomes more likely.  One insider in those operations goes rogue and partners with a hacker group and they can loot the entire exchange and all the accounts.  Once the crypto is gone, its gone. If Coinbase gets looted 100%, they are just going away and no amount of insurance hedging would repay people back fully if that happens.
It lot harder to steal large amounts of crypto if everyone stored it on a personal hardware based wallet like Ledger Nano S.  Probably not worth someone's time to kidnap you, force you to perform a two factor authentication from your hardware wallet and then transfer the crypto to their account.

If they know for sure that hard drive is in the landfill, the garbage is worth more than the landfill operation at this point.

Like Andreas said, the more you try to ban something, the more it will make people want it.  Now SKs are trying to figure out how to open their European based futures brokerage accounts so they can trade the BTC futures.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:29
No, these are not unregulated crypto-exchanges.  The CME and CBOE futures exchanges can only match make buyers and sellers, they can't sell a futures contract on their own.  
A futures broker is the conduit for people to access the exchanges.  Futures brokers receive a transaction fee for the service of sending your executed order to the exchange.  They are not in the business of buying or selling the futures contracts either, just sending your match making offer to the exchange and recording the fill price.

GDAX vs. Bitfinext exchanges battling today for which will be the market price leader.  Only 1 can win. 
When GDAX hit $20,000, the price difference was $4,000.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:18
In the last hourly price candle on GDAX
High - 19,697
Low - 15,101
That type of volatility will should sober people up a bit.

He is taking the position not to help make the BTC futures market, but to help protect the financial interest of Interactive Brokers in doing this.  He said because he does not want to risk that Interactive Brokers clients go short BTC, then the BTC futures price hits lock limit up, then the market gets in a run away up cycle not allowing margin called shorts to close positions, and then Interactive Brokers is on the financial hook to close these short positions at their cost.  But his company, his choice on that.
I understand his concerns as a broker as taking undue risk to allow short sellers, but adding market manipulation to not allow sell side order to this event will only cause more mania IMO.

No matter the age, if someone isn't curious enough or a willful learner, they'll only uptake something when it means their survival.
I had the BTC conversation each with my divorced parents, both about 70.  My mother was very interested and she didn't understand how BTC would work.  She did believe me that there is a chance BTC changes the world in a dramatic way and a also chance that it doesn't amount to anything and ends up worthless.  My argument was better to take some amount of money now and buy a small amount of BTC in case it changes the world.  She sent me what she felt she could lose and I now hold some BTC for her in my hardware wallet.
My father couldn't believe a non-regulated BTC would ever amount to anything because "the government and rich financial people" would never allow it.  He just doesn't believe radical change, uncontrolled by the elite is possible.  He will adopt BTC if he is forced to buy his groceries with it and will deal with that when it happens he says.

Agree that BTC price barriers in the 1Ks being set in the collective conscience is important.  Price swings up and down between the 1000 barriers will create opportunity for traders.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:39:08
No, if BTC changes the world's financial and currency system, a small amount of BTC now will give you a usable stake 10 years from now.
Buying even a couple hundred dollars today will mean you own more BTC than 99.99% of everyone on the planet.  That will be meaningful in a decade.

All of these crypto-exchanges are their own ecosystems as no exchange is available to all people depending where you live.  DGAX price is exploding because Coinbase is the main avenue for US residents to purchase BTC and the US market is making a rush.  The South Korean exchange is moving even higher as their residents are rushing into BTC on their exchange.
If US residents could us Bitfinex and buy BTC for $1.5K less than GDAX, they would.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:58:21
I don't think Wall St. proper has been able to buy much BTC yet.  This is why the CME and CBOE are launching the futures markets in the next week.  
They will use the futures to pump and dump to make their $$$.  Give them at least a month to pump BTC price with the futures before they start yo-yoing it up and down from there.

The "Spoofing" is happening.  Whether it is an individual "whale" trader on said exchange or the exchange itself is unknown.
As all these crypto-exchagnes are completely unregulated, so in theory the exchange itself could be spoofing with fake large buy or sell orders to influence market prices for their own personal day trading accounts.

You are missing the time risk that before you can get your bitcoin transferred to and from one exchange you will be able to sell it again for the higher price.
To do this right you need to be able to "short" a bitcoin on one exchange and then "buy" a bitcoin on another exchange.  Then as prices come back to alignment on both exchanges, buy back the short and sell the one you bought on the same exchanges as the original transactions.
Example:  Exchange A price - $10,500  Exchange B Price - $10,000.  Short exchange A, buy exchange B.  One sold for $10,500 (short) one bought for $10,000 = $500 profit.  
But to capture the profit you must unload both positions simultaneously as prices on Exchange A and B are the same again.  It doesn't matter what those prices are, so long as the are the same when you close both positions you will be $500 ahead when you add both account values up again.

So the bitcoin exchanges are basically buying and selling a "promissory" note that gives you the right to buy the bitcoin from the exchange when you want to transfer it to your bitcoin wallet then?
That means there are thousands and thousands of daily buys and sells kept as a ledger by the exchange of who bought and sold these promised bitcoins and who actually owns one..  Did anyone think that this is the exact opposite of why bitcoin supposedly holds value over other methods of currencies?  Bitcoin is valuable based on the fabulous "immutable, permanent transaction history verified by a decentralized group of nodes" and people are actually using exchanges to using record keeping the "old fashioned way" to access bitcoins.  Weird.
People buying and selling "bitcoins" that are not part of the public registry flies in the face of what bitcoin is supposed to be.  All sorts of ways for this to end badly.  The fraud risk for any exchange going rogue or individual working at one of these going rogue is high IMO and people who have "promised bitcoins" in their exchange account could be left holding the bag.

So long as you can find an exchange that will let you short, I'm not familiar enough with them to know if any do.  I was looking at both GDAX and Bitfinex simultaneously today and saw several large price discrepancies this afternoon $300 - $500 type differences.  Since these exchanges operate as "dark pools", prices are being set in their own ecosystem of users independent of other exchanges. Price can get out of alignment on crazy volatile days.
This type of arbitrage cannot be done on traditional stock exchanges like NASDAQ as all order flow is posted in the same bid/ask central exchange and visible to everyone in the same market at the same time.  So long as these cyrpto-exchanges operate independent of each other, there might be some opportunity to do this.  But like anything, the more people looking for it will make the windows of opportunity harder to take advantage of.
