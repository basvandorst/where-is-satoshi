That doesn't make sense. Either he did steal the coins in which case you wouldn't be getting them back, or he's managed to recover them and he's not the asshole you think.
This sub...
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:23:39
I'm being trolled right now. Nobody is this oblivious. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:16:14
It's been a much better investment than bitcoin so far.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:19:15
You're fucking crazy dude. Assuming you weren't lying about being contacted to be a paid shill then it was 100% some guy winding you up because you're clearly deluded enough to eat that shit up.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:20:18
But it helps him get his blog hits and that sweet ad revenue.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:25:34
No wtf are you talking about. They article didn't post any recording or video. At least the quotes where he said he wasn't involved have evidence behind them.
@_date: 2014-03-10 01:41:13
I wouldn't be better off putting my money in a river. I fail to see your point.
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:46:57
Chill out, nobody is saying that. It's just that it's in the spirit of dogecoin to donate it all away partly because of the fun community and partly because there's fuck all else to do with it :P
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:09:55
But their unproven evidence is that he said he was the creator. And we now have proof that he said he is not.
@_date: 2014-04-29 14:40:18
Please don't tell me you suggested bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:18:43
Sure buddy.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:58:43
The video interviews where he says it. That is proof that those words come out of his mouth. She has none.
How is this difficult.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:34:30
Sure, they could buy again when it's lower. Like now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:54:03
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:29:23
Why not panic sell? You just buy at the bottom and make more bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:42:26
Oh please.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:37:48
Cached site. That was a few hours ago.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:25:38
Yeah, you had the chance to double your bitcoins there.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:19:19
I did sell and feeling pretty smug about all the people on here yesterday saying "thanks n00bs for panic selling, I bought a load at $140".
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:21:41
Can't even sell at $120 lol
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:47:37
Exactly, it still goes up the same percentage.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:01:49
That would be a good statistic if bitpay was a standard of some sort. But bitpay was still pretty young then, of course it will grow.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:28:50
Good job.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:36:06
Considering all the trading engine lag and bugged MTgox then it's not a bad idea. It's certainly not going to recover as quick as it crashes.
I'm just salty because last time this happened there were people laughing at people who panicked sold, then the price crashed even more.
People are only telling people not to panic sell so the price doesn't crash as much.
@_date: 2013-04-01 15:49:52
That looks really cool, thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:11:12
Some sites are above market value since people know they will pay more. Which is in turn pushing the price up.
Right now the valuation in GBP is £150, but you can't buy them for less that £190 on bitbargain.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:18:24
Here 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:23:28
Oh god why.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:27:57
What are you supposed to do? Even if you buy bitcoins to spend it's going to be pointless keeping them there while the price plumits.
Getting tired of people thinking that selling coins during a crash = investors. It just means you're stopping yourself from losing a bunch of money.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:27:46
But you're losing money. Should have sold when it was higher huh.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:20:49
IM LOSING MONEY AND DONT WANT TO RISK SELLING MY COINS*
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:22:10
Of course if you were smart you would have sold at $260.
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:12:42
What? No.
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:37:26
I know on bitstamp lots of people put their bitcoins up for sale. Then each bitcoin goes to the highest bidder. Unfortunately the site went down and no orders could be placed or cancelled. So what happened was while the site was inaccessible a bitcoin went to the highest bidder at $200, then the next coin went to the next highest bidder at $199 then the next at $198 and so on. When the site came back online the price had dropped to $80. Which was a massive undervalue at the time, so everyone put in a buy order which re-populate the order list and the price jumped up to $170 again.
Huge mess IMO. I don't envy anyone who's hoping to sell when mtgox re opens and shit hits the fan.
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:47:50
But mods are totally corporate shills and us brave warriors wont be stifled!
Grow up you're an embarrassment.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:14:37
My trading experience comes from hats in TF2. It's surprisingly similar.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:38:33
I clicked sell on bitstamp while the price was high ish, then the site went down and by time it came back up it sold my bitcoins for $110.
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:07:03
Looks like it.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:10:59
Some of us didn't have a choice :(
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:48:50
Some other subs have tried to go no rules and let the votes decide. It's always been the subs full of idiots and children though because they're the ones who think "fuck adults, we can live our own life". Then of course the mods get tired of their shit so they remove the rules like you suggest and let votes decide.
There was a 3 week experiment on and after 1 week the users were begging for the rules to come back.
tl;dr, subs need rules to stop the subreddit turning to shit.
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:51:58
A lot less transparent though.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:44:20
I for one am glad people are actually spending them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:50:45
Yeah now sure what's going on there.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:28:26
Don't forget to spend them!
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:18:20


No they didn't. Anyone who didn't sell yesterday and buy back a few hours ago screwed up.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:28:31
DDoS supplied by people trying to sell/buy.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:15:28
It costs more in electricity to mine coins.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:38:37
Sorry but this sub is way below the average subreddit.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:15:48
Didn't those noobs make a smarter investment than anyone still holding?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:06:44
What price did you buy them at?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:42:59
I think whats most frustrating is that bitstamp has been buggy since when i tried to sell at $260.
And now it's $170 and still wont let me sell.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:24:41
Put my bitcoins up for sale on bitstamp when it was around $170 and having problems, didn't realise my sell order had actually been put up until the site finally came back online and I saw $110 in my account.
All this lag and poor server management makes it very hard to do anything in these crashes.
Would never recommend them again.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:54:02
But the current price is lower than any point in the crash.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:23:37
That's bitstamp, the price plummeted to $70 there which was upsetting if you put your bitcoins up for sale as the site was down from around $170 to $110.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:00:44
Didn't you get gifted a buttload of bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:13:53
I made the same mistake last time. I put my coins up for sale at $250 but the site went down so no new order came in. They kept auctioning off bitcoins to the bidders though and they sold mine for $90.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:42:25
If anyone has any recommendation for selling I'm interested as well. I bought at bitbargain but to sell you need a steady supply of bitcoins which in understandable.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:30:56
MTgox sold more today than all of January or something.
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:20:17
Most of it's propaganda to try and drive up their value of their wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:49:06
He didn't say only people who have bitcoins make bets...
Just it's a decent audience to target due to the nature of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:36:50
This is all I needed to dump a lot of money into bitcoin. Thanks Albert!
@_date: 2013-03-24 01:46:16
How did you manage that? There's could have been the users coins on that page.
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:40:27
Haha, good point.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:49:32
Reddit subs turn into circlejerks eventualy because it's a group of people who like the topic. But usually hyping up your game or TV show might get them a bit more exposure to improve the game. Thats why the internet if filled with Apple v PC and PS v Xbox.
So imagine how bad those circlejerks are for a tiny amount of gain for the user, and swap it for a user who stands to make thousands of dollars by promoting bitcoin. 
This subreddit is disgusting for the amount of bullshit they tell people in order to drive up the value of their bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:02:17
Yeah, no-one ..... ._.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:40:08
Same price haha.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:39:03
On mtgox with an hour delay yeah. Instant sales are $85 right now.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:19:20
Withdrew some money from bitstamp and it said it completed. Nothing in my bank yet.
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:51:19
I don't know how to acquire a private key for the denomination I used.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:27:52
Isn't that more like $16m?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:26:54
Did you sell at a high and rebuy?
