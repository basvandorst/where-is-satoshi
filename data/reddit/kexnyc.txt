I read the linked article. I understand now.

That doesn’t explain how it got its initial value. How would that pizzeria record that transaction on its books?

1.  Thanks for the link. 2. Is it really necessary to take a scolding tone when someone asks a question?

Ok. But it seems like a closed ecosystem which would have problems squaring itself with real-world financial transaction regulation. 
For example, you sell me a widget paid for in bitcoin. That’s a tangible good. You, as a merchant, have to report that sale to the government. How do you account for that sale using existing accounting regulations?

I disagree. But we can let it rest here. You have your way, I have mine. Thanks for your input.

I did find an explanation in the link someone posted. Makes sense to me now. Thanks.

Really, I do understand all that. My question is more focused on squaring bitcoin transactions with real-world regulations regarding currency exchange/transactions. 
As I understand it, a “thing” cannot merely purport that its a currency simply because someone says so. So, far, I have not found any facts explaining how bitcoin gained its value.

Because I did not know that I was doing so. I was looking for some explanation beyond that. I found it in the link someone provided.

I get it now. Thanks.
