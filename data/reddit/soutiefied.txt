i could go on. but im gonna leave you alone now cause clearly you have issues XD
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:30:35
all i can say is you would single handily make bitcoin price increase by some margin so you you probably never end up getting to 21 million bitcoin in the first place.

0.00000001 is one satoshi. There is no infinite. you are clearly misinformed XD  
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:06:24
simple answer yes
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:21:41

@_date: 2018-01-27 17:22:26
first of all your an idiot XD comparing them to roman coins XD as for mining them till 2140. Thats not what the user asked he said is it possible and the straight answer is yes.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:16:19
There are very few people that can give you an answer and the people who can wont.

the only issue is that if bitcoin is say 20% more expensive in korea it normally goes hand in hand with other currencies.

And how do you know if your transaction has been rebroadcasted 
@_date: 2018-09-19 21:08:46
it is basically gambling But if you are a gambler it has the best odds. and by odds i mean maker/taker fees.

Its funny cause i always feel you in a win lose situation. You gotta decide what you want if its USD or bitcoin(or what ever coin you are in) and go from there. If i at the start of this year said i wanted more USD i would have been smiling as it would have been my base line. but im in it for the bitcoin and so far this year its been rough pretty much down hill. Have some fun play with .1 of a bitcoin and see where it gets you.

And now you have a coinbase employee looking for 2 bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:47:26

@_date: 2017-11-14 06:06:29
Just FYI you are looking at the TOTAL amount of bitcoin i have sent to that address....i only sent 0.21474361 BTC on this occasion.
But i totally agree with you on that exchange
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:02:26
