The saying isn't judging the means, its *justifiy* the means. Jesus Christ man, open a fucking book.

You don't get it.

No, I get it just fucking fine. Look, here's an example. Hitler needed people to build his war machines because he started a war and he wanted to win it. So rather than have Germans build the tools of the trade, he forced Jews and other people from the countries that Germany occupied to build them for him without pay. He also did this so that when the armories inevitably got the piss bombed out of them, the Jews and other occupied slaves would die instead of the German citizenry. 
In the end, he was able to use this strategy to build a massive military which he and most other Germans were proud of. The means of creating this were absolutely deplorable, but the end result was successful so in Hitler's mind all of the means were completely justified. 
This is the exact same mentality that you are using with your ridiculous "social contract" theory. It's fucked and it is the epitome of the phrase *morally bankrupt*.

No, you just sound like an idiot.

None of his means were justified in any sane person's mind but they were completely justified in Hitler's mind along with the majority of the German citizenry. That is the whole fucking point. Neither is taking a 35% overnight from someone's nest egg with the bitcoin deal. That's not part of "the social contract" it's fucking thievery, plain and simple.

I think what he is saying is that in your mind, the ends justify the means, which is a classic tenet of statism 
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:15:49
And there you have it. That's precisely the way Mao, Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot and every other statist despot throughout history thought too. 
You're fucking nuts.
