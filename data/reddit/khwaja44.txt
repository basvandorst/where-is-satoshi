This is actually very good advice. Doing this is called collar cost averaging. You will likely not make the greatest return on your investment doing this, but you are also all but certain to not invest the entire amount you are going to invest at the market peak. On the flip side you also will not be able to invest everything when the market bottoms.

But actually you still have no airplanes, right? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 16:08:49

@_date: 2014-09-21 15:51:11
Amen. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:23:20
Awkward.

TedX finally decided to talk about Bitcoins...

Totally agree with you man
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:25:15

How do you know about firewall rules? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:51:24
No but i really want to start. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 19:10:49
I don't think there is a service that does that, but thats a pretty good idea, if they would do it in my Country, they do nothing, I might even be the only one mining bitcoin too XD
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:22:48
Nice that someone mentioned that. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:35:40
I thought that their passphrase is "guest" or something. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 17:35:26
What rollercoaster is? 
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:28:14
Imo we should forget about the chair of CEO of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-28 07:06:50
Mining is very risky, for trying to multiply it I would do Loans with confirmed users who are good on paying you back.
@_date: 2014-09-21 15:50:32
It's pretty fast. Trust me.

I think that if you could vote anonymously and online, being able to verify and audit the votes, it would be quite perfect even if you still had to use a central authority for registration. 
Decentralized identity and reputation systems are quite difficult to achieve but people are working hard on that, for sure. 
Still I think we overestimate the importance of secrecy in voting. And we should be preparing good platforms for when the time comes that we have the perfect voting systems.

100 bitcoins is a lot. I only wish I had that many myself to be honest that would be quite impressive. 
In answer to your question if I had 100 bitcoins I would definitely choose to store them in an offline cold wallet and store around 10 bitcoins in one wallet before opening another wallet to do the same as previous.

Most people do not keep cash fiat in this fashion for 100 years. They have no reason to. 
Someone that has put their fiat USD into an investment that is "designed" to be kept there for a long time (eg stocks, long term bonds) then would have done very well over this 100 years, even after accounting for inflation.

I'm about to become a fan of it. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:29:12
Why did you decide that bitcoin people are always angry?
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:29:11
Sounds like a great rule of how to find an angry man.
