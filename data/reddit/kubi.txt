No, no one knows.  The letter doesn't even say anything important, so if you did miss it you're not missing out on anything.  It just says you should report your trades.  If you've done that, whether you got a letter or not, you have nothing to worry about.

They have to wait for the funds to clear from the bank.  I hear if you live in the UK something changed somewhat recently with hold times, but I live in the US and I haven't noticed any change.  It used to be I had to wait for funds to clear before the coins appeared in my account (then they could be transferred immediately), but now they give me the coins immediately and don't allow withdraw until the bank transfer clears.

None will let you do that because then you can just cancel the bank transfer and they'll have given you BTC for free.  The delay is a direct result of you using the banking system and has very little to do with which exchange you use.

Yeah, the way I read it OP hasn't tried to login?

That's not good advice if you're dealing with exchanges.

Coinjoining is great advice if you're a privacy nut.  If you're just a person who wants to occasionally convert between FIAT and crypto then coinjoining is not necessarily making your coins safer.  It might make them harder to track, but it makes them more likely to be "confiscated."
As generic advice, I still disagree.  Coinjoining is not for everyone.

I see.  Good luck with your illegal endeavors.

I've seen a fair number of posts from people who had exchanges hold their funds after they deposited coinjoined funds, usually for transactions over $10,000, which in the US triggers a Currency Transaction Report which is submitted to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (the government).  So they're not really confiscated, they just get held by the exchange for long periods of time, or possibly indefinitely.  My understanding is this is likely due to money laundering regulations and the exchange has identified this as risky transaction because some of the outputs from the joined coins might have a sketchy source.
I'm still totally with you.  Privacy should be the default, and there should be no reason for these mixed coins to be considered tainted.  Sadly I think it's still true that coinjoining puts you at a higher risk of having a hold placed on your account if you deposit those coins into an exchange.
In an ideal world everyone is just making P2P payments, there's no reason to convert to FIAT, and there's no reason to be worried about who is sending which coins where.

You should absolutely buy a hardware wallet, which do cost money, and are significantly more secure than software wallets (which are free).
You can store your own keys with either a software wallet or a hardware wallet, but software wallets are much more susceptible to malware attacks.

I don't understand what you hope to accomplish by that.  Use your own account.

You're thinking of SSNs.  SNS in this context is referring to social networking accounts, like their myspace name or whatever.

Yes, it's just like sending it to any other address.

Buy on the exchange, transfer to your wallet.  People demonize exchanges a lot, but reputable exchanges actually are the safest way to buy cryptos.
Once you've transferred the coins off of the exchange and into a wallet that you control those coins are yours.

They said the hackers had access to API keys, they didn't say API keys were used to withdraw the funds.  It was a single transaction that drained their whole hot wallet, it was not pulled from end user accounts.

The part where you're sending money out of the country with the explicit intent of avoiding capital gains taxes.  You spelled it out pretty plainly.

If you can easily afford the loan payment of $200/month then just buy $200/month in Bitcoin.  Taking out a loan is a bad idea.

Why bother asking a question if you're just going to argue with everyone?  You are stating that you intend to commit a crime.  The law is all about intent.

Yes.
