I just preordered it from g2a.com, was 0.061876 btc, and seems legit yeah. 
I don't think it's like a prepurchase though, so I might have to wait until release to get the actual code, but we'll see.
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:05:17
[Here]( I'll help you out ;)
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:52:43
Why are you projecting your transsexual fetish on to me?
All I did was point out incorrect use of the word "theft". I honestly think you should calm down and invest in a dictionary.
Oh, and welcome to reddit, probably lots of "trap pronz" for you here ;)
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:02:43
Sorry, i forgot to specify that I'm after an EU battle.net redeemable code, as I live in Norway. Wish I could shop at Newegg :P
Thanks for trying to help :)
@_date: 2016-08-20 18:32:17
Mind sharing the details? I ended up buying from G2A, but like you said, delivery of the key won't happen until launch. If I find a better way, I might just hook my friend up with the key I get at launch...he is on the fence about legion anyways :)
@_date: 2016-04-06 16:02:51
Why is that video of Dimon talking garbage about bitcoin always included?
So many MSM articles just pop that in there, often without any particular context or good reason. It's ridiculous lol.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:26:11
That's not how this works at all...


The burden of proof is on you. Please show me data that clearly shows that "bitcoin is being rejected by merchants" at a higher rate than being accepted by new merchants.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:00:03


Well, I sent 25k+ yesterday for under a dollar in fees (a normal 1 input, 2 output tx), so that leads me to believe that you are. 
Either you are an idiot, or just dishonest.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:04:38


Made me chuckle ;)
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:17:46
So you don't have any evidence, got it!
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:44:29
I'm not misinterpreting anything. I sometimes like to check peoples history to see what they are really about. In crypto this is especially useful, because there are so many people with dishonest agendas.
Direct quote from one of your posts in r/btc (speaking of bcash):


I can't take you seriously if you really believe that the single most scammy altcoin out there has "real fundamentals", it literally invalidates every opinion you have on crypto...in my opinion of course.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:58:54
That link....yeah sorry, not touching that.
Edit: ...and yes, I realize it might well be legit. Just saying that it looks really bad at first glance
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:07:55
Nope, Bcash is still a total scamcoin who has gone through many cycles of pump and dump, and there will probably be many more to come.
It's still a centrally controlled shitcoin with no skilled devs and seriously scammy and unethical promoters. There is no reason for it to even exist. There are alts who are better at being "bitcoin cash" than Bcash actually is.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:49:53
lmao, rydan is still around. I remember this clown barking anti-bitcoin stuff back when it was like a hundred bucks :D
Mate, you were wrong, and you're still wrong. 
Hahaha seeing you here still doing the same ridiculous shit puts a smirk on my face. Comedy gold right?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:04:05
Right now, 20-30 satoshi/byte transactions are getting into the next block, so I suspect that's just blockchain dot info being big block propagandists as usual and are full of shit.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:16:52
Get this BCash garbage propaganda out of here. Nobody cares about your short sighted "scaling" lol. 
Bcash is completely pointless. It serves no purpose.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:30:17
I hate Hanlon's Razor, it's always used as the perfect excuse to let malicious crooks off the hook. 
Judging from your RES tag and your post history, I'm not surprised you would post this though...
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:13:19
This is so obviously a coordinated effort to discredit. This bullshit "story" is being run everywhere, and is completely unproven and old news. 
I have to say, the "then they fight you" phase is pretty frustrating.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:46:08
I think you answered your own question:


It went up a lot in 2017, so a correction was due.

Great job guys!
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:09:49
Sell it on an exchange, then withdraw to your bank account. Easy.
You can also do OTC trades or use localbitcoins if you need cash in person.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:33:36
You just contradicted yourself completely. 
It's funny how you actually think you are saving people lol. You are like a perfect example of that specific stereotype in r/bitcoin. We have had you guys doing the same shit for years. 
Hint: You aren't saving or helping anyone, and your arguments aren't balanced, they're one-sided.

[Relax, this is not the end.](
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:16:10
My guess would be that is was the language that Satoshi was most comfortable with, and would rather just start coding than learning another language/syntax before putting his ideas into code.
Also, C++ is not bad.

Fuck off troll.

This is obviously a lying troll post.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:40:05
1 million+ sold, and your support your claim of "many customers are far from satisfied" with 3 reddit posts?
There are always some customers with legit issues of course, but most likely these are local computer issues or something other than a fundamental flaw in the device or software. IMO.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:40:43
I'm not sure what that is to be honest. American news or something?

@_date: 2018-01-17 09:12:41
Well, I'm not employed by anyone, so in your simple world I must be a retard.
But anyways, do you have any evidence? I'm genuinely curious.

Obviously people testing LN on mainnet is only doing so with funds they are comfortable losing. 
The best test is actual use, so if they are OK with chucking some satoshis in there to test it out, good for them, and us.
I think they should be applauded as pioneers.

@_date: 2018-01-26 16:44:55
Actually, it's a garbage FUD article spending most it's time harping on about tethers and other shitcoins and how it's a bubble. Thanks for wasting my time...
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:22:34
OP, If you don't like Bitcoin, why are you here? Is it some misguided need to "save" us silly bitcoiners or what?
I honestly don't understand why you are posting here or engaging at all...Whats the point?

Yikes. First thing I see is an autoplaying video with notorious scammer Roger Vers face talking up bcash. He is such a scumbag it's unbelievable.

I'm surprised you manage to tie your shoes in the morning. 
Holy shit that was a proper garbage post if I have ever seen one.

I see nocoiners and r/btc numpties say this all the time, but never see any evidence of anyhting shady with Tether. Why is that?
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:15:29

...of course.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:42:18
Hearing about a lot of these cases. 
Feels like this dip on low volume is partly due to, or at least exacerbated, by an "operation choke point" for crypto of some sort.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:31:25
The amount of trolls, haters and shills in this thread is astonishing.
Someone really doesn't want bitcoin to continue its success.
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:53:44
You gotta love nocoiners who find it in their heart to come over here to inform us of the problems with bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:40:22


That you are a 1 day old troll account. Next question!
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:08:50


As an adult you can do what you want, but try to educate your parents instead of creating a feud over this.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:37:46
LMAO are you honestly this naive?
Please dude, explain to me what you actually think is going on here? I'm curious.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:40:49
BitPay being incompetent again, what a surprise!
BitPay pretty much betrayed the bitcoin community, so they can go fuck themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:14:37
Get this shit outta here. Reported for what is likely the 15th duplicate of this garbage.

I'm just not interested in any links from you.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:45:30


Are you fucking serious? You are doing the same thing lol.
So you are not part of the bitcoin community then I take it, so what are you doing here? Is your life so miserable that you have to sit in a subreddit for a tech you don't use or like and stir shit? 
Honestly, screw how I look, YOU look seriously pathetic.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:05:27
What went through your head making this post? What do you think it contributes? 
Although my questions are obviously a bit snarky, I'm genuinely curious about what made you think this post was in any way a good idea or useful to the community.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:53:45
Oh the irony, coming from a Bcash r/btc numpty. lmao

Cool. Good luck to you guys :)
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:08:14
lol, dunno what kind of answer I expected out of a known troll. 
Anyone with a serious answer? 
I'd love a link of any kind with evidence. It's a legit request, as I have not seen any. 
Obviously the idiot I'm replying to has no evidence, but there must be some evidence out there since so many trolls are harping on about this?
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:49:38

@_date: 2018-01-31 01:53:01
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:56:37
Probably stuck in mod queue for a while or something.
You're a pretty consistent anti-bitcoin poster, so perhaps all your posts have to be pre-approved by mods or something. This is just speculation though, and I don't even know if there is a mod feature like that, but I know they can give people "approved submitter" status, so it's not far fetched that there is a similar opposite status.  /shrug
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:36:59
Thank you for your valuable input.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:55:25
Of course it is relevant. It's exposes your level of knowledge in the crypto space.
Would you discuss science with a flat-earther? I wouldn't. I wouldn't take anything that person says seriously, in the same way I don't take anything you say about crypto seriously after knowing your position on said scam-coin. Have a good day.

It has been posted like 10 times already. Give it a rest, there is nothing of value in the article anyways.
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:24:21
He doesn't even get through the first paragraph without that completely unrelated and asinine stupid tulip comparison.
Paul Krugman is seriously a joke. Him and his fake nobel lmao.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:12:02


Why? What do you mean by two communities? If you are talking about the bcash/anti-bitcoin community, then you're doing that false equivalence bullshit again.
And no, I'm not going to waste my time reading any more of your twitter profile after this little preview.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:38:50
I've been asking the same thing from all the nocoiners and trolls claiming that Tether is shady. Nothing but crickets. Never a single shred of evidence. I honestly think it's just another angle of attack to cause FUD.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:30:53
Citation needed...as always.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:53:56
We tried like a week or so ago, and they actually removed it for like a day before putting it back. 
The scammer Ver most likely paid them off to put it back, and CMC are obviously corrupt. Sad stuff.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:38:39
Someone wants off the roller-coaster and needs to puke huh ;)
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:10:45
Well, for starters, the title says "Evidence is mounting..." and then the article proceeds to present no evidence at all. Does that not by itself qualify it as garbage?
How about this sentence, how is this not just laughable?:


It's not objective at all, in fact, it's completely skewed because the author is reaching a conclusion without any evidence.
I don't care about, or use, Tether at all, and I'm sick of seeing these garbage articles with no evidence of wrongdoing. As billions of dollars has flowed into crypto in the last years, why the fuck is it so hard to imagine a few of them flowing into USDT? It's really not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things.
Nocoiners and bears who have sold their coin just want it to go lower, and using any FUD possible to reach their goal. Simple as that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:27:17
Yeah, it was actually way under a dollar, I just couldn't remember the exact amount because it was so insignificant. I could look up the tx when I get back from work, but I don't think anyone would really care. These detractors aren't too big on facts anyways, unless they support their narrative.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:38:14
Who spent hundreds of millions? Citation?
Anyways, if you are referring to Lightning Labs, I'm not sure what their primary business model is, but have you considered that most people in this space are holding bitcoin, and any improvement to the tech will benefit everyone holding?
Also, some people do actually do stuff purely for the benefit of everyone. It's a little telling that you can't imagine this, I guess that's not something you are capable of?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:34:16
Yawn. Trolls, trolls everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:59:20
Not on bitcoin though. He is seriously ignorant on that topic.
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:43:27
You're not fooling anyone. Your posts indicate quite clearly that you have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:25:17
This is moronic. Everyone uses tech from even earlier than 2009 all the time. 
In your little head, what point did you think you were making here?
lmao, these morons show up with their completely ignorant "ideas" every time there is a dip in bitcoin. I guess we are on the right track :)
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:59:19
I don't support this at all. 
I don't think it's anyone but your own responsibility to make sure you benefit from every shitty fork out there. 
Unless the exchange or wallet is specifically advertising that they will release the private keys or release forked coins, you should not take it for granted that this will happen. At this point you guys are just crying after failing to take responsibility yourself. I'm sorry if that is offensive, but that's how I feel about it.
If you want to be able to capitalize on every damn scammy fork out there, you need to roll up your sleeeves, take some damn responsibility and take control of your own private keys. Do bitcoin right.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:01:35
The unique properties of bitcoin of course.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:34:15
What a child.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:30:07
I don't believe the percentage is this high at all, unless they include things like a kid who smokes a bit of weed and is also using bitcoin as being "associated with illegal activity."
I know a lot of bitcoiners, and none of them are criminals or do any illegal activites. I know this is anecdotal evidence, but 25% of all bitcoin users just sounds ridiculously high.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:25:54
lol, the good old "blerkchein, not bitcoin" and "I'm here to save the silly bitcoin investors" arguments.
You really have it figured out /s

lol, I remember this being part of the FUD cycle a few years ago. 
I guess it's being put back into rotation these days.
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:07:48
Bitcoin is not called Bitcoin Core, it's simply Bitcoin.
You should probably spend less time over at r/btc.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:49:28
lol, where do all you numpties even come from?
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:29:02
Aww, is your concern trolling and FUD not being effective enough for your liking?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:15:55
Yeah, if you could stop promoting scam ICOs on this subreddit, that would be great. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:38:11


Well, that right there is part of the problem. 
I honestly hope it works out for you, but you aren't doing yourself, or the exchange, any favors by spamming support tickets.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:35:39
Well if you had any evidence you would just link it, wouldn't you?
I now firmly believe there is no evidence, since you can't provide any, after all that. Hav fun being an asshole to people on the internet, I'm sure your life is amazing ;)
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:28:17
This must be a joke. 
Some of the very best cryptographers and computer scientist/developers in the world are on the Bitcoin Core team. The scaling methods in their roadmap are nothing short of genius. It allows us to scale up to mass adoption, while still maintaining the most important thing: Decentralization.
Remind me to never use any software you develop if you can't see this...
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:47:23
Bullshit. Try using it maybe?
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:43:57
Stop linking to that shitty scam site.

Still bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:27:43
...and still it's being blasted all over the bitcoin subreddit by these shitty blogs. Sigh.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:19:08
Nice try Jeffries....the article was a rambling mess of smugness and hindsight. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:56:07
lmao, you couldn't be more wrong little weeb. Early 2012 adopter here, so I'm doing ok, don't you worry about me.
The expression is "hodling the bag", not baggage btw. 
I love hodling these bags to be honest, they have literally changed my life for the better.

LOL, um yeah, no thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:35:13
I don't use Coinbase, and never have, but yeah I'd recommend everyone using some other service if possible.

r/bitcoin announces shitcoin scams as not welcome here.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:07:01
What is the point of this post exactly? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:35:40
Moron confirmed.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:57:35
They also list bitcoin dot com as the website for Bitcoin. 
Total scumbags, most likely corrupt as fuck, and paid off by Ver.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:26:11
If I had a great idea right now, I would be all over it myself haha :P
By all means, maybe your site will be miles better than any other and THAT is what will set it apart. If you think that's the case, go for it. 
I guess my comment was a bit of a reaction to the insane amount of new crypto sites/blogs being spammed on the various crypto subreddits these days.
Good luck either way :)
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:04:39
I worry about the idiots who have 60% in ETH and only 40% in BTC to be honest. I guess that's because I don't believe in centrally controlled coins, and so far Bitcoin is the only coin decentralized enough to care about. IMO.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:41:50
I mean that it is not a problem at all that bitcoin uses the amount of electricity that it does. 
There is no shortage of electricity on earth and now that we are moving rapidly towards solar and other renewable energy sources, this is really not going to be an issue at all.
We basically have unlimited energy from the sun, until it burns out in billions of years. Honestly, in a not so distant future, nobody is going to be caring about electricity use at all. The sun is a very powerful source of energy.
So to be clear, what you think is a problem, really isn't a problem at all. That's what I mean.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:26:45


What the actual f...
lmao where do these morons get their information?
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:58:51
No, it literally can't be argued....at all. Bcash hardforked and is incompatible with the Bitcoin blockchain, while Bitcoin did a soft-fork upgrade, and continues to be compatible, and continues to be Bitcoin. Like holy fuck how dense can you get...?
I don't understand how anyone can do the amount of mental gymnastics and spout the amount of total garbage that you Bcash trolls do. Is it all just greed or what? Help me understand.
You have been bamboozled by a very skilled conman, and you have no idea it has happened. I honestly pity you.
I will insult you all day long if you continue spouting this mindless garbage.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:19:19
Clueless shitcoiner rambles on about stuff he knows nothing about, repeats all the big block numpty rhetoric while predicting "the flippening" unironically. Could the author expose his ignorance and embarrass himself any more? I think not.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:34:35
Yes, seriously fuck any shitty company that is ready to throw Bitcoin under the bus to promote other scam coins like BCash. 
Luckily Bitcoin is so resilient and BCash is...well BCash lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:55:53
I wouldn't be surprised if they simultaneously also launched a Bcash buy feature, with the sell feature "coming soon."
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:15:05
Could you post a more obnoxious post at all? Holy shit. Fuck off.
@_date: 2018-01-31 14:22:34

Bitcoin is a lot more useful than fiat currencies in certain situations and less useful in some others. Saying bitcoin fails in every utilitarian test compared to fiat is just nonsense.
Your comments in this thread tells me you either know very little about cryptocurrency, or you are just trolling for a reaction. 
Maybe you are just hostile to unknown things, like most people. That's ok I guess, but you should really just research and learn more so you don't come across as uninformed/ignorant.

Umm, no, you didn't say that in your tweet, and your tweet makes it sound like there is some doubt as to who is trying to collude to undermine bitcoin. It's so transparent, and honestly, it's really offensive to the bitcoin devs.

You're seriously linking a Tether troll twitter account that just reports the same things Tether themselves do?
There is no question about USDT being created, what is in question, is if they have the USD to back it up.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:15:59
I don't understand what you mean. Why would you need to "redeem" it. Can't you just trade it for USD or BTC or any other coin on the exchange that supports it? Wouldn't that be the same as redeeming it?
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:46:50
More merchants are starting to accept Bitcoin than rejecting. 
You are completely full of shit. I'm not sure why you are being dishonest, but lets try something.
If you made a list, one with merchants who have rejected bitcoin in the last 1 month, or 6 months, and then make a list of new merchants accepting bitcoin in the same timeframe, which one do you think would be the longest?
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:33:54

I don't spend much time there, but could you explain what you feel their narrative is?
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:13:26
I don't like it, I LOVE it.
Regarding your other points, I think you are misinformed. There are more new companies accepting bitcoin than actually dropping their support. It's just that there has been some high profile companies that has (temporarily) disabled bitcoin as a payment method.
When it comes to Microsoft specifically, they actually restored Bitcoin payment shortly after they disabled it, so that was probably the worst example you could provide.
Anyways, as to my opinion, I think you should hold, since there are a lot of positive developments happening and long term I think the price is going a lot higher than right now. In the short term, I have no idea what is going to happen.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:29:05

I think it is correct that you'd have to open a channel to receive LN payments, but why wouldn't a merchant simply do that?
OpenBazaar devs are working on some cool stuff, but they are notorious big blocker numpties at the same time, just like you, so this kind of exaggeration of this "problem" is not surprising.
If a merchant has to open a channel with one transaction on the blockchain to be able to receive payments instantly with super low fees, what's the actual problem? Sounds like a great solution to scaling for retail adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:31:45

Be very careful and think this through properly if anyone is considering this. Might very well be a really shitty deal, and a straight up scam at worst.
Remember that nobody is getting their actual BTC back, but rather some share of the fiat value of the BTC at the time of the collapse (not too sure of the exact details, so look them up)

They could be setting up for arbitrage between exchanges, or a number of other reasons, I have no way of knowing without asking the people behind the deposit.
The thing is, USDT is no less verifiable than USD on Bitfinex, so it makes no difference really. It's all just FUD really...you could just as easily be screaming from the rooftops that all volume on binance is fake, or that the BTC price is artificially pumped on Bitstamp with USD that only exists in their computers. The reason for this is because you can't verify any of that either. You see when that USDT is "printed" but you don't see when some other billionaire user gets 50 million USD credited to his trading account from a deposit. So you attack USDT, when in reality they are pretty much the same thing, you can't verify the validity of either deposit anyways.
Just boggles my mind that you guys can't understand this simple concept: People put money into Bitcoin, Bitcoin price goes up.
Edit: spelling

You do understand that his lies are objectively and provable false right?

Of course Bitcoin could scale on-chain, it's just a terrible idea, as agreed upon by basically the entire bitcoin technical community. But of course, you know better... 
I can tell from your post that you have no technical understanding of the problems and limitations that Bitcoin and other blockchains face. Of course Bitcoin has deviated from the original design, it has been improved upon a lot as new discoveries are made and new ideas are thought up, implemented and tested. It's an evolving technology.
The whole spiel about "deviating from the original design" and "satoshi's vision" shit just makes you sound like a religious nut.

[Are you being serious?](
How delusional could you possibly get? LMAO maybe you should stop getting your news from Vers propaganda outlets and rbtc. You're like a goldfish swimming in your own small bowl of piss. 
So, out here in the real world BCH is the laughing stock of the crypto and cypherpunk communities, it's propped up by a conman relying on domain- and twitter-handle squatting, pay per tweet campaigns, and other shady tactics, to even keep the coin from tanking completely. Even with all that effort, it is constantly losing value to Bitcoin. 
It is actually pretty funny that you would accuse me, a BTC maximalist, of losing money, when the BCH/BTC rate tells a different story. In fact BCash is pretty much just bleeding out value to Bitcoin, slowly but surely.
So no, you aren't leading anything, except the race to the bottom.
Oh btw, there is [one address]( that appears to be responsible for nearly half of all Bcash transactions.
You know, the one thing that really kills me about the whole BCH and BSV scam/fiasco, is that a lot of young, impressionable guys and girls are getting bamboozled into peddling some sleazebags copy-cat coin. Some might go down with the sinking ship, and when they get older, they are going to look back at this whole crypto thing with contempt. Instead of being happy, and proud, about being part of the bitcoin revolution in the early days of the 21st century.
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:35:19

The r/btc shills are out in force I see.
Bitcoin dot com is certainly not trusted. Not at all. They prey on newbies in the market, and try selling a centrally controlled chinese knock off shitcoin called Bcash to them when they are looking to buy bitcoin.
Bitcoin dot com IS a scammy website run by a scammy criminal. That's the truth. Anyone can check the post history of those who are defending bitcoin dot com. Most are r/btc numpties.

Maybe I'm pointing out the obvious here, but if you haven't noticed, there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of accounts here in this sub that are all either brand new, or old accounts who just recently started posting about bitcoin.
They are all anti-bitcoin, and are calling it dead and over, a ponzi, a scam, a fraud, etc. etc. 
A lot of them are also very active in periods of  approximately 8 hours a day, kinda like a days work if you know what I mean.
There are some very powerful forces that want Bitcoin to fail.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:24:26
Well, yeah, eventually Bitcoin will probably have a hardfork to increase blocksize and implement a bunch of other things that needs a hardfork, but this post is about BCash and their numpty "scaling", not Bitcoin, and is therefore 100% irrelevant in this sub.

You understand that when Tethers are "printed", it's because someone deposited USD or other funds, right?
This tether FUD is getting seriously stale. 
Yeah, no shit, the price often goes up after a chunk of USDT is created...and why do you think that is? 
It's like saying "I wonder why the price always goes up on Bitfinex, right after someone deposits 50 million USD."

Honestly, it's weird how you "don't understand" this simple concept. It's like everywhere else on reddit, when an opinion is shit, it gets downvoted. Simple as that.
The whole idea that downvotes should only be used when something doesn't contribute to the conversation, is fair enough as a concept, but upvotes/downvotes have been used as agree/disagree since the beginning of reddit.

This false equivalence bullshit has to stop.

How can you pretend that your FUD theories have any value, or is of any interest to anyone, when you don't even understand how the technology works?
I just looked through your post history and I have absolutely no desire to continue any conversation with you. Go educate yourself before engaging please.
Strong opinions on subjects you know nothing about is not a flattering look. FIY.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:00:34
Pointless comment.
I don't use USDT. I don't promote USDT and I really couldn't care less about it.
What I do care about, is all these fucking numpties harping on and on about USDT in the bitcoin subreddit, all without a single shred of evidence that there is anything fishy going on.
Why is it so hard to believe that a few billion USD has flowed into the space through USDT, when that is only a fraction of the total that has entered the market?
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:13:56
Sigh, this again...
It's not censored, it's just moderated, like every other topic specific subreddit is.
r/bitcoin simply needs strict moderation because of all the shitcoiners and scammers trying to reach and exploit its wide audience.
@_date: 2019-07-12 18:27:46
Then we pretty much agree no? I feel that should have been pretty clear from my comment. Thanks for the instant downvote btw, I'll know not to engage in any discussions with you from now on.
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:01:05
Nice strawman there. You're attributing a lot of opinions and quotes to me that have no basis in reality, and that's not cool.
Anyways, I understand what you're worried about, but why is USDT different than say the internal USD accounting at Bitstamp or any other exchange? You have no way to validate or verify that those numbers aren't inflated with money created out of nothing either.
To be clear, I don't trust USDT and I've never used USDT, but I understand why it is popular and why it is useful and needed in the crypto world. 
Honestly, if you couldn't see when USDT was being created, nobody would have a problem with it, just like nobody has a problem when some rich asshole deposits millions on Bitstamp or Binance and buys Bitcoin, pumping the price.
This Tether FUD is much ado about nothing imo, but we'll see I guess. I'm not worried personally, as I am very risk averse with my coins, and don't need to use USDT for anything.

@_date: 2019-07-08 20:28:17
Yes I believe that.
I'm not relying on trust at all, because I don't use USDT, and most likely never will. I'm just trying to explain how it's supposed to work, and why it's natural that BTC price goes up shortly after new USDT is issued. How much trust or faith you want to put into that system or concept is of course up to you, but the way OP is framing it, it's like it just a pure scam to pump Bitcoin, which is a laughable take.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:20:26
There are already a bunch of sites like that, and new ones popping up at a fast pace. 
Seriously, my advice would be to scrap the project and focus on something unique, innovative and valuable to the Bitcoin space/community instead.
Sorry, I realize that is not what you wanted to hear, but it's my honest opinion.

Sure, think about it however you wish, but I really don't want LN as a part of bitcoin.
I feel it is actually really important to keep the codebases and dev teams separate. The bitcoin base layer should be just that, so we keep it simple, safe and robust. Then we build whatever on top of that.
Think of LN as a part of Bitcoin all you want, but I'll fight to keep it a separate thing. I do love LN though, just to be clear.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:42:02
It's not hard, any moron can do it (see Bcash), but it's not a smart way to scale bitcoin when much better scaling is on the way.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:04:36
That's a lie. 
Only the scammy forks like Bcash and B2X get rightfully accused of this, since they claim to be Bitcoin, while they are clearly not.

Word of advice, if you want to have any kind of discussion here, you need to stop with the "pyramid" bullshit. I commend you for trying to understand something before investing, but the little you think you already understand is comepletely flawed. There is no pyramid. Back to the drawing board.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:03:45
The problem is the intentions of the bcash scammers. It's basically created to fool newbies into buying it thinking it's the real bitcoin. They use astro-turfing campaigns and sockpuppets to spread propaganda and false narratives about bitcoin and prey on noobs. It's a complete shitshow and the only reason BitPay is doing this is because the sociopath Ver is and investor in BitPay and is pulling the strings to line his own pockets.
Yeah sure, this is a mostly unregulated market, but that just means we have to be vigilant and weed out the bad actors ourselves.

I didn't really "flip out" mate, let's be real here haha. It's just a pet peeve of mine that some people insta-downvote when having a conversation back and forth. 
Anyways, I absolutely agree that Bitcoin as a concept should include LN. Hell, there's a good chance average Joe won't even do a single on-chain transaction in the future. I think LN is great and see a bright future for it. I simply don't want it to be included in the reference Bitcoin client.
So yeah, we agree, I only made my comment because it wasn't clear from your OP that you meant separate codebases etc. Carry on :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:01:15


That's a quote from you a few days ago, but I guess I took it too far and it's a stretch to call you a Bcash pumper. My apologies.
Care to address my actual points though?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:34:10
It's just a coordinated effort, kinda like a pump and dump, but more complicated and more effort. Basically what they do is this:
-Buy Bcash
-Dump bitcoin
-Flood the bitcoin network with spam transactions.
-Spread FUD all over the forums about said transactions and make people believe the sky is falling (as you can probably tell here today)
This is not the first time they pull this shit though, and probably won't be the last time. After the last round of this was over, and Bcash was dropping and money was flowing back into bitcoin, we actually had a flood of posts afterwards from noobs having been fleeced by the pump and dump. A lot of them were basically just feeling really shitty from being bamboozled by Ver &amp; co.
So yeah, don't believe the bullshit. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:29:30
What do you mean "if" it turns out to only be a scam?
I mean, it's a functional cryptocurrency, there is no doubt about that. What makes it a scam is them using the "btc" subreddit and bitcoin dot com to promote it and trick users into buying it, thinking it's bitcoin. There is no "if it turns out..." here. This is happening today, now!
Ninja Edit: You are right about it reflecting poorly on all of us, but you should direct your frustrations towards them, and make them stop using the bitcoin name and subreddit to promote their altcoin. Instead you come here pleading for us to make peace with the people trying to fuck us over? Makes no sense.
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:16:52
Wired is really pushing this false narrative lately. I wonder why? 
I don't know anything about wired and their ownership structure etc., but it seems pretty clear that they are determined to constantly talk shit about bitcoin and make up imaginary problems at every opportunity.

@_date: 2017-12-15 18:54:55
Simply put, because there are very powerful forces in the world who doesn't like any competition when it comes to currency creation and control. If "Satoshi" was a known public figure today, he would most likely be persecuted. He disappeared shortly after the CIA got interested in bitcoin back in 2010. Probably a wise move.

@_date: 2017-12-13 22:14:52
eh, you still don't get it. 
I don't think I can help you understand this, if you're still ignoring the fact that Bcash doesn't have the one main property that makes Bitcoin so valuable and important: Decentralization.
Good luck with your centralized clone of Bitcoin, I'm sure it will be perfect for you. I'll stick to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:06:40
There is only one thing more pathetic than actually believeing the lie that Bcash has solved scaling, and that is the utterly ridiculous "Satoshi's vision" rhetoric.

I wouldn't be so sure about that. It is illegal to defraud, and I think Roger Ver and bitcoin dot com is treading a very thin line and he should be very careful of his actions. I think his extremely unethical and scammy behavior is going to catch up to him eventually, in one way or the other.

First of all your statement is factually wrong. It's far from 90% and I think you just pulled that figure from your ass.
Second, a lot of people have made a lot of money on Bitcoin, that's just a fact and people like making money, and people like talking about making money. Sure, I would like more technical discussions too, but I think you are blowing things out of proportions. There is a lot of discussion not only about price here, and if you spend more than 2 days here you'll find out. Welcome to reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:19:59
Dude, wake up. They are claiming that their shitcoin is bitcoin, and literally tricking newbies into buying their coin. Why do you think their sociopath leader gets so pissed when we call it Bcash? It's because that name prevents him from scamming new users with his copycat coin.
Why do you think there is not the same criticism towards other altcoin subs? Because their subs aren't called "btc" and try to sell their coin as bitcoin. It's unethical and scammy, and if you can't see the difference between the two subs, and still think we should "all just get along", then you are insanely naive.

You're making the mistake of thinking the two communities are engaged in some kind of ideological war between two equal parties. This logical fallacy is called [False equivalence.](
You have to understand that it's the scammers over at rBTC that is trying to hijack the Bitcoin brand and sell their shitcoin to newbies claiming it is Bitcoin. One of the ways they trick newbies is pretending that we are two equal communities who both have equally valid views and arguments. 
Unfortunately, I see you have bought their bullshit.

If you think the two communities are in any way equal, you seriously need to work on your critical thinking. rBTC is a scam community, run by a scammer conman, and their only chance of success is trying to maliciously hijack the Bitcoin name.

I'm going to ignore the fact that you're a Bcash pumper for a second and ask you this: 
Why is it hard to believe that hundreds of millions of dollars are being funneled into tethers, when the crypto space is seeing such insane growth? 
Is it not natural that a fair chunk of the money flowing into crypto will be in tethers, since they are used on some of the biggest exchanges?
What evidence do you have that something shady is going on? Your "writing on the wall" is not really conclusive.

That depends on the size of the transaction (in bytes). There is no "regular" fee in bitcoin, that's just whatever your wallet dev designated as "regular".

This has happened like 3 times before, and the tide will will flow back to normal once Ver and his moron army runs out of steam. I literally pity you for being taken for a ride by those scammers, but at the same time, you deserve it for helping the scam.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:43:29
So if you have recovered it with your old seed words, all you need to do is install the Bitcoin Wallet app onto the device.
1. Download the "Ledger Manager" and "Ledger Wallet Bitcoin" from the Chrome Web store thing. You most likely already have the wallet one installed.
2. Open the Ledger Manager app and connect and unlock your ledger device.
3. Install the Bitcoin wallet app onto your device from the Ledger Manager interface.
4. Open "Ledger Wallet Bitcoin" and start the bitcoin app on your device.
5. Now you should be back to normal and the balances should be correct.
Hope this helps, good luck :)

People can exchange their bitcoin for whatever they want, even the dumbest of things. Case in point: Bcash.
But again, what evidence is there that there is not actual USD backing up the tethers? If there is any, I'd like to know. I'm genuinely asking, because I see a lot of accusations, but very little evidence of wrongdoing.

You don't think someone who uses his wealth and his domain bitcoin dot com, to fool newbies into buying Bcash thinking it's the real bitcoin, is a piece of shit?
He is constantly using astro-turfing and sockpuppets to spread FUD about bitcoin and pump Bcash to line his own pockets.

sry, replied to wrong comment :P
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:49:05
That's not a normal fee in bitcoin to be fair, his transaction is most likely very large in bytes. I'm guessing he has been accumulating coin over a period of time in small transactions, and is now trying to send this to the exchange. The way bitcoin fees work makes transactions like this very expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:25:53
The more relevant question would be: Should bitcoins marketcap be compared to that of a company? I'd say no.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:55:48
Your problem, to be quite honest, is that you have no clue what you are talking about. 
Why on earth would you possibly compare a censorship resistant, peer to peer, decentralized currency, to Apple Pay and Venmo? Makes no sense.
I think bitcoin might not be the right fit for you at this point in time. Once we have widespread adoption of Segwit and Lightning Network running, we'll beat them on all fronts, and you should check back then. Most people investing in bitcoin right now are doing so as a store of value or because they know these improvements are coming. Revolutionary tech takes time and effort.

I don't get it, if you are unhappy with you bitcoin, that's fair enough, I won't question that, but why on earth would you go Bcash? It's a scammy chinese clone, made to fool newbies into thinking it's bitcoin. It's centralized as fuck, and has an unethical sociopath "in charge". It's a complete shitshow, and probably the worst choice of all alts. There are much better alts out there if you really don't want to hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:18:35
The blockchain doesn't lie. If the transaction is confirmed, someone has the coins.
Either "someone" is lying to you, trying to make you pay twice or scam you somehow, or perhaps your computer is infected with that malware that switches any BTC address you copy to your clipboard, making you send the coins to a scammer and not your "someone".
On the blockchain, is the receiving address the same as the one "someone" gave you?
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:32:23
It was kinda like the Squawk Box talking head panicked and wanted to stop him from actually saying it when he realized where he was going with that sentence. McHenry saw through that and talked over him quite firmly stating the point: "You can't kill Bitcoin."
Cool and telling little clip.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:59:44
It really depends on how long this insane hype will last. Usually these things go in waves, and we are only talking a few days/week since transactions with 44 sat/byte fee would be processed with no problem. You can look into something called "RBF(replace by fee", or "CPFP (child pays for parent)". 
I'm on the move, so can't help you anymore right now, but know that there are options if you really need to move the funds right now.

BCC is BitConnect Coin or something. It's some kind of MLM scheme involving some shitcoin. Nothing to do with Bitcoin.
Unless of course he is completely retarded and mean Bcash, which is the scam project of some chinese mining pool. They cloned Bitcoin and are now trying to push the narrative that it's better than bitcoin and is taking over. They even have a subreddit named btc to confuse newbies into buying their clone bitcoin. It's shady as fuck.
Bottom line is, the guy you are replying to is either misinformed, or he is maliciously trying to shill Bcash.

Well if your premise is a lie like those you just told, and with your shallow understanding of the issue, I can understand that you think that way, but do some more research. I skimmed through your post history, and to be honest you have zero understanding at all about the history of bitcoin, the technical challenges of a decentralized network, and why bitcoin has value and thus, why Bcash is pointless, and quite frankly malicious.
You are forming strong opinions based on bad information, that's not helping anyone.

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:34:46
You need to look at sat/Byte, not the dollar value. My guess is the balance you are trying to move is a large transaction, not necessarily in value, but in bytes. The more space in the block your transaction occupies, the more expensive it gets.
Is the balance you are trying to move made up of many small transactions? That would explain it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:31:19
Could you be any more naive? I honestly doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:22
Nobody needs approval to make an altcoin. 
The problem with Bcash is that it's a malicious fork, who preys on newbies who think they are getting the real bitcoin. There are rich, powerful assholes behind it, like Roger Ver, who uses his domain bitcoin dot com to trick people into buying Bcash. It's a real shitshow and a very unfortunate situation, that's why you see a lot of old school bitcoiners giving them shit about it and calling out their unethical behavior.
There is no regulation in crypto, so we the users have to call out bullshit and malicious actors when we see them.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:32:08
It just irks me that you actually know its a scammy premined banker controlled coin (XRP), but you still push it on newbies in r/bitcoin.

I'm not completely sure what you mean to be honest. If you think there is some kind of pyramid, then it's your actual understanding of bitcoin that is flawed, not your choice of words.
The main purpose of bitcoin is not to "make money". It **IS** money.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:21:24
OK, here is what I know, or think I know:
If you haven't already filed a claim, I think it's too late. I have family members who have been through the whole process, and it was all concluded years ago. all info was collected, Bank account details for refund was sent etc. but nothing has happened yet.
Settlement will be in fiat value, so even if you got something back, it wouldn't be (your amount of coins) * (todays price), but rather a set price per coin. I saw the figure $440 per coin being thrown around.
If I were you, I'd try to come to terms with your loss and move on.  And remember, it's still not too late to get involved in Bitcoin again in a meaningful way, it's still early days. Good luck with everything!

I guess, I don't know. I don't use tethers at all, and have no interest in them. I just find it a little telling that it's always Bcash pumpers and buttcoin trolls that keep yelling about this in the bitcoin subreddit. It's not bitcoin, and has nothing to do with bitcoin. If some noobs want to trade their precious bitcoin for some USD-coin, I couldn't care less.
So since it's you who is actually spreading the fear, and warning people of some kind of fraud, I think it's only fair that you provide the evidence.

I'm not sure what they would try to do, or realistically could do, but my guess is he didn't want to stick around to find out. Satoshi was also against trying to get Wikileaks to accept bitcoin donations when VISA/Mastercard/PP cut them out from the traditional finance system, so I guess he just didn't want the attention at that stage.
You are completely correct saying that it doesn't matter if we know who he is. The code is open source and has been audited by some of the best computer scientists in the world.
It makes no difference if we know who he is, but I sure am glad he did what he did, since it just adds to the amazing story and mystique that is Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-13 18:42:55
Who/what is a Frogolo?
Anyways, in case you truly just are ignorant, and not malicious, I'll let you in on a little secret: 
**No blockchain scales at the base layer.** That's why we need layer 2 technologies like Lighning Network to actually truly scale. Since this is just a technical fact, there is no reason to apply linear band-aid scaling methods like increasing the blocksize until we know the requirements of the network when SegWit and LN is fully implemented, working and functional. Bcash and other shitcoins think they have solved the scaling issue, when in fact all they have done is reduced decentralization and security.
You're welcome.

Like I said, the blockchain doesn't lie, so that means your "someone" is lying, or is unsure about how this works or something. Is that person also new to Bitcoin?
The transaction on the blockchain is irrefutable evidence that the transfer has taken place. The bad taste in your mouth is understandable when you are likely dealing with a scammer. Good luck trying to sort it out.

I'm looking for a decentralized system that is both a store of value and transactional currency. Selling Bitcoin to buy Bcash is simply a monumentally stupid thing to do. Look at the trends, and look at how Bitcoin will scale with layer 2 tech. Bcash has no long term scaling solution....well except "hurr durr bigger blocks", but that's just short term thinking and not a solution at all. The technical community is in almost total agreement there.
But, sure, go buy some more chinese clone coins. I'm sure you'll do great.

Since you quite obviously don't already have one, here is a clue for you:
**No blockchain scales at the base layer.** That's why we need layer 2 technologies like Lighning Network to actually truly scale. Since this is just a technical fact, there is no reason to apply linear band-aid scaling methods like increasing the blocksize until we know the requirements of the network when SegWit and LN is fully implemented, working and functional. Bcash and other shitcoins think they have solved the scaling issue, when in fact all they have done is reduced decentralization and security.

You really should stop getting your information about Bitcoin and scaling at rBTC. You'll actually become less informed, and at worst, misinformed over there. It's an intellectual vacuum and a refuge for altcoin pumpers and scammers. Do yourself a favor and get your information from more credible sources and prevent yourself from embarrassing yourself with obvious ignorance.
Increasing the block size now is a bad idea, as agreed upon by pretty much the entire technical community. Why on earth do you think you know better or have some kind of solution they already haven't considered and rejected?

I agree with the bait and switch practice that has become common. It's shady as fuck.
I'd still be careful about headlines like that though, it's not really clear what your actual problem is here.

So you accuse me of no-true-scotsmanning you, which is obviously bullshit (and it sounds like you probably don't even know what it means tbh), while simultaneously making a point out of you being an earlier adopter than me. That's not really a good look for you, but whatever. If what you say is true, then sure you are an earlier adopter than me, but only by a few months, but why the fuck would that even matter? Congrats.


The network is fully usable and working as intended. Store of value is a very important use, regardless of your opinion on it. BTC is the bottom, most secure layer, in what will become many many useful layers over time. Right now it is doing exactly what we want that 1st layer to do...and 2nd layer tech like LN will make BTC a great transactional currency again.
How much money do you have in shorts right now? I assume you are shorting Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:42:02
When you say the transaction is "small", do you mean in dollar value, or in Bytes?
Bitcoin fees are best expressed in satoshi/Byte. The transaction can be very small in dollar value, but perhaps comprised of many inputs, making the transaction large in Bytes, which in turn makes even a high dollar value fee too small for your transaction to confirm in a timely manner. This is one of Bitcoins technical peculiarities and is not very intuitive for beginners.
If this was unknown to you, I suggest you spend some time to learn how Bitcoin transactions and fees work. Good luck :)

That's exactly what you do. You claim that the fees today is a good reason to apply the band-aid fix that is a blocksize increase. Even when faced with the fact that the bitcoin technical community has considered it and rejected it, you still think you know better. So yes, that is exactly what you claim.


What exactly is worse? Is Bitcoin worse than Bcash and other shitcoins, is that what you mean? The only reason Bcash is not facing the same scaling problems, is that there's not as many people using it...because it's just a knockoff of bitcoin that brings nothing useful or innovative to the table.


Well of course there is no empirical evidence since a blocksize increase has not been implemented, but when a bunch of experts run a ton of simulations and models, to actually find out IF this is a good idea or not, that's as good as it gets. Nobody is going to risk the live network because some rBTC troll demanded "empirical evidence" that a larger blocksize is currently a bad idea.
Like seriously dude, step the fuck down, and realize that there are thousands of people much smarter than you (not saying that's me or anything) working on this, and they evaluated a blocksize increase, and rejected it at this point in time, based on technical tests/models/arguments.
Your argument is that fees are high, so therefore we must increase blocksize now! The experts don't agree with you, but you still want to do it. Would you trust the janitor to make decisions on how to run the nuclear reactor too? Don't you realize how asinine that is?

There will be more than enough people willing to do that to still have bitcoin be decentralized. I would run a node both at home and at my office, and I know plenty of others would too.
The increase might not make anything better for the people as you say, but it might just save us from a catastrophic system failure if a surge of sudden adoption hits us. There is a real chance this will happen considering the services and applications being build with almost a billion dollars in VC funding.

As for bitcoins origins being shady, I guess I would agree in the sense that we don't really know the exact origin, so therefore we could call it shady. 
In the end it doesn't matter much, since we have the source code. It was released to the public by Satoshi, whoever that is, and this code is now being probed, testet, vetted, and of course altered, by some of the smartest computer scientists in the world, and we know what it does.

If you look at the average blocksize chart, I'd say that's evidence. It is increasing towards 1MB quickly. It's not critical right now, but we need to increase it before it becomes a problem.


I googled "eligius transaction fee" I think. If the information is wrong, then it should be changed. So you honestly have no affiliation or economic benefits with/from Eligius anymore? If so, then there's a lot of information that needs to be updated around the web.


Yes, but it was never meant to be artificially limited with 1MB blocksizes. Is it not true that this was not the original design, and was put in as a TEMPORARY anti-spam measure?

No, they are actually lies. Factually, and objectively. If you can't tell then you are simply exposing your ignorance, or malicious intent.
First lie:


The average transaction cost for Bcash for the last month has been hovering between $0.15 and $0.55, so the lie is off by 5x at best and 55x at worst.  
Second lie:


Bcash has the same block time as bitcoin, so on average 10 minutes between blocks. Sure, that is minutes, but actually 10 of them.
It takes so much more time and effort to debunk bullshit and lies, so I really hope that mods can just ban people that actually spread lies on purpose. We don't need more misinformation and ignorance, and we don't need people with limited understanding of the technical challenges forming strong but misguided opinions and spreading them on reddit.

- There is a clear conflict of interest, as your pool is keeping all transaction fees to itself (
Of course you want to keep small block sizes, just so users of the bitcoin system have to outbid eachother to be included in the limited block.
Oh, and let's not forget this little gem from your pool policies:

I guess you are just lucky then, and never push a tx when it happens,  because it happens multiple times a day. Time between blocks &gt; 20min is not rare.

While I agree it is a bit silly, it is nowhere near as pathetic as what you buttcoin guys are doing. So how many fresh accounts a day do you make? Have you ever asked yourself if you should channel your energy into something else?

In Norway we can only buy precious metals without VAT if it is a coin with a nominal value. Bars or nuggets or anything without nominal value is not VAT exempt.
I remember buying a Canadian Maple Leaf 1 oz gold coin for 33 BTC(!), and there was no VAT or import charges, because it has a nominal value of 50 CAD.
You actually have to pay VAT on coins too, or just bars?

I agree this one is a classic, but I think that is mainly because of my interest in bitcoin and the memories attached to that particular song  :)
Some of the songs on the new album are amazing, and I definitely feel the production quality has increased a lot, and the lyrics are dope as usual.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:30:49
Holy shit, this guy! lol.
So he believes bitcoin is an NSA creation, fair enough. But get this: One of the main points he brings up is how he made a word cloud of an early NSA paper called "How to Make a Mint: The Cryptography of Anonymous Electronic Cash". 
Lo and behold, the words bit and coin appeared in the word cloud, and not only that, the words are right next to eachother! 
Well, I can't refute such strong evidence. I'm glad that matter is settled then.

Why are you reposting your own post from 12 hours ago?
@_date: 2015-06-09 15:33:38
Could the real reason also be that certain devs are working on sidechain implementations that would not really be needed (yet) if bitcoin got a 20MB blocksize limit now?
And could it be because certain devs are running pools, and want the users to compete for space in a block with higher fees?
I don't know the answer to these questions, but I'm not sure I'm convinced that everyone involved in the discussion want what is best for bitcoin. Everyone is selfish on some level, that's human nature.
@_date: 2015-06-30 19:04:19
And you don't think it's worrying that they have actual plans in place for how to deal with an event where they put Blockstream ahead of bitcoin? As opposed to just saying "we will never..."
That piece of information does not make me any more comfortable with the Blockstream crew and their intentions. Not at all.

@_date: 2017-12-19 19:35:17
Actually, we have so many forks of bitcoin, because some noobs thought they knew better than the bitcoin technical community, who rightfully rejected a blocksize increase. Also, some forks are created out of pure greed and malicious intent to defraud users. See Bcash.

There is one thing that, in my opinion, is worse than the exuberant enthusiasm coming from the 'to the moon' crowd in and that is when people generalize like that.

As for why he got downvoted, I suspect people simply didn't agree with his 'valid point', and that resulted in downvotes. Reddit might not have been designed to work that way, but in reality, the voting system is agree/disagree, and has been for a long time.
Personally, I wouldn't have downvoted him, even though I disagreed with his statement, and don't think the halving is fully priced in, but it was that edit that earned him a well deserved downvote. It's just how reddit works.
@_date: 2015-06-21 18:11:38
Actually, We kinda know the system is fragile, the last tiny stress test showed this. There is no reason to launch some super scaled up attack like this, when we know the outcome. It's just going to hurt bitcoin. We need to find a solution for bitcoin scaling, not work towards breaking bitcoin before we can find said solution. 
Widespread adoption in Greece is not about to happen anytime soon, so this is not a real threat. The general public is not even close to being interested in bitcoin, anywhere in the world. The whole idea that Greece is just about to jump head first into bitcoin is quite frankly absurd. Barely anyone in Greece knows what bitcoin is. 
This said, I love bitcoin, and I wish it was true that Greece is about to go all in. The reality is we are growing slow and steady, which is good, and right now we need to get through the scaling issue without falling on our face. 
I just don't think bitcoin is as anti-fragile as many think it is, and what they are doing here is a really bad idea. Of course this is just my opinion.

It's a way for people who are already holding BTC to spend it easily at places that accept VISA, but doesn't accept bitcoin yet. 
Going straight from dollars to BTC, then spending those BTC through the Xapo card as dollars again, is obviously not a financially sound option, and I don't think any bitcoiners are advocating that.
In the end it's about having options, and some people are even willing to lose a little to fees, simply to strengthen the bitcoin ecosystem.
Speaking about weird things: I find it really weird that you guys create multiple accounts every day, just to troll and derail the discussion here in What is wrong with your life? Why are you guys putting such an amount of effort into harassing other people?

Dude, your post doesn't reveal any weakness or fault with bitcoin, as it sounds like you believe, only your ignorance on the subject. This topic is covered in pretty much every basic bitcoin information source, so your research simply can't have been very extensive.
I think you will find that the bitcoin community is very helpful, if you don't start your posts by being a complete asshat, and leave behind your obviously misguided preconception of this community.

More like 400k now by the looks of the charts, and the increase is accelerating. In early 2012 it was around 25k, and in early 2013 it was 100k, so it has had most of it's growth in the last few years.


I agree there would be time, but I fear the notion of anything "emergency" is a lot more damaging to confidence and public image. A concisely planned and executed hardfork would probably just increase confidence in bitcoin and it's future.
Are you expecting to never have to increase the max blocksize at all? 
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:01:40

yes, and it does. It gives me a quick sense of where that persons head is at. Like if someone is very active in a flat earth forum or something, I'm not going to say it invalidates everything they say, but it does make me take it all with a grain of salt.
The fact that this person is a trumpet, doesn't invalidate everything he says, but it does help me (and maybe others) know how much value to put on his statement.
Of course, completely invalidating everything that person says would be stupid, but that's not what I'm doing.
Off topic:

Look, Bitcoin doesn't care how you obtain it or how you use it. You can trade it for marbles, work for it, buy it with fiat, mine it, etc. It really doesn't matter and doesn't mean bitcoin is somehow dependent on some governments fiat. The thought is honestly a little ridiculous.

@_date: 2018-05-29 15:12:03
FYI, OP is an r/btc numpty who has linked to this thread over there to call in the brigade "just for fun". Just a heads up.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:24:46
So you have been satisfied with them so far, and only now is there a problem because the mempool saw a sudden spike around 5-6 hours ago, and you're already on reddit talking mad shit. 
Your tx will probably go through soon, and the fee that Bitstamp had set was pretty much spot on if it wasn't for that sudden spike that happened 5-6 hours ago. [See here for yourself.](
Maybe you should just relax a little and not be so incredibly impatient? Sometimes a lot of people suddenly want to use bitcoin, and we get situations like this. It doesn't mean the sky is falling and bitcoin is a piece of shit lol. Take a deep breath dude.

So thank you, mods of r/bitcoin!

If someone has some BCash leftover from the airdrop, I guess this is a good a use as any.
If you're gonna pay your taxes with crypto, or at all even, you might as well get rid of the garbage coins first.
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:27:08
I get what you're saying, and yes we need a more permanent solution. 
However, until then I think it is important that the bitcoin community vote with everything they have, and bring ghash/CEX down a notch or two, make it hurt their wallet. The next company that approaches &gt;50% of hashrate then knows that it's actually in their best interest to self-regulate and stay well below that.
@_date: 2018-05-29 22:42:56
No worries, rereading my comment now it does seem like I'm making it out to be some big thread, and not a few comments with one or two upvotes lol. So my mistake also.

OP is a troll, it's glaringly obvious lol.
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:52:35
Yes, yes it is.
I'm not interested in discussing any shitcoins in r/bitcoin, sorry.
Here is a simple rule of thumb to determine if a coin is a shitcoin or not:
Is the coin called Bitcoin, and is compatible with the implementation found on bitcoin.org? 
If the answer is no, it's a shitcoin. Quite simple really.
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:18:49
So this is some shitty clickbait? To actually see all of your 7 points, not just the 3 first ones, I have to go to an external site or follow your twitter, is that so?

Well, the earth is provably and undeniably spherical, and Bitcoin is also objectively and undeniably NOT a scam... So you can't really put them in the same camp at all.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:49:26
It would just make it easier to quickly see if the coin is overvalued or undervalued imo. Just more quick info to make better decisions I guess.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:34:28
Your premise is completely wrong, rendering your question rather pointless. This is obviously a direct result of you spending time over at that intellectual vacuum that is r/btc without enough critical thinking. 
Bitcoin is not just a store of value, and the numpties that are trying to convince you of that, are simply dishonest.

Who says anyone is relying on it? We can't stop GS from doing what they want in the blockchain space, and this post is just reporting the news that they will start a trading operation. It's open for everyone to use.
Your childish attacks have no substance as usual. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:51:57
Well, they're not wrong.
Anyways, a bit off topic:
 I wish these sites would have a column with "price normalized per bitcoin unit" or something. As in, giving a price of the crypto if it had the same exact amount of coins in circulation as bitcoin. This would be very useful. Does anyone know of a site that does this?
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:26:29
[About that...](
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:57:50
Nope, it's already confirmed a shitcoin.

eh, why lie about something everyone can just quickly check?
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:20:19
lol @ this desperate buttcoin troll 
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:17:03
Just FYI Ghash.io never achieved 51% of the hashrate. Variance made it so they had, at one short moment in time, solved 51% of the blocks in the last 24h period, but they never actually had 51% of the hashing power. Maybe it's a nitpick, but still something to keep in mind.
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:07:19
Not a joke, just variance and is completely normal. 
Also, it was 44 mins between the blocks you are referring to. Not a big deal.
@_date: 2018-05-15 14:48:58
Based on blockchain? 
So...it's a shitcoin and has nothing to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-11 12:52:34
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:01:20
You're lying again. There was a lot of discussion on these boards about blocksize, and saying people got banned for having an opinion on it is straight up lying. 
Only if they started promoting an altcoin, as in any coin not adhering to the consensus rules of bitcoin, would they get banned, and usually only repeat offenders. I was here through all these years, I know first hand.
Saying you'd get banned for discussing blocksize is just deceptive and seems like a play straight out of Vers playbook. Stop it.
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:24:14
ROFL, can't tell if serious...

He should be banned for being an obvious troll though.

Smells and looks scammy as fuck.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:56:45
I'll try to explain with an example:
Lets do it with Litecoin. LTC is $160, so a lot cheaper than BTC of course, but it is a bit misleading just comparing the price, since there are 3.3x the amount of LTC in circulation. 
If you take the current marketcap of LTC and divide it by the current circulating BTC, you get a "BTC normalized" price for LTC at around $530.
This just makes it easier to quickly see if a coin is undervalued or overvalued. Of course there are a ton of other factors, and this is just something that would be nice and convenient to have listed in it's own column.
Hope that cleared it up.
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:29:54
How would that be a better analogy?
Bitcoin doesn't hurt or kill anyone, and these comments are absurd.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:52:37
It's a straight up fucking scam, it's not about liking or not liking it, it's about protecting newbie bitcoiners from being scammed by these criminals and negatively affecting the adoption and perceived legitimacy of bitcoin.

You are correct. I just assumed he meant around the peak at the end of November. I shouldn't assume, my bad. 
My point still stands though, since by the sound of it, OP hasn't made any gains in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:29:47
Some might actually be delusional enough to believe it, but I think the brains behind the scam know it's all bullshit, but is pushing it for personal gain.

I'm going to need some more information on who this new management is before I go ahead with the transfer. Anyone know?
@_date: 2014-02-18 23:57:53
You might be right, but it would be a strange thing to say, given the context, if he didn't mean currencies like Bitcoin.
PayPal already has a wallet that can hold multiple types of currencies ( so the fact that they are working on a new digital wallet, and the fact it was mentioned in this context, makes me think this might actually happen.
PayPal could easily become an instant leader in the Bitcoin space. Secure wallet, escrow service, off-blockchain microtransactions, and even exchange and trading. They could really be a massive force to be reckoned with.
I know a lot of bitcoiners love to hate on PayPal, and often with good reason, but there is definitely a need for such services. And honestly, with the way banks are working against Bitcoin, I welcome them to our corner of the ring.
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:08:37
Nope, he is just a traditional finance guy who doesn't understand anything about bitcoin and has to include something about "beanie babies" because it makes him feel superior.
The price of bitcoin might be manipulated, sure (I mean, every time a trade happens it manipulates the price to a certain degree), but this guy has no clue and is just another mindless detractor clinging on to old asinine arguments.
@_date: 2018-05-09 17:27:48

The coins are being auctioned, and if I were to guess the buyers would be bitcoin startups and existing companies needing coins to operate. It wil cause some panic, and some downwards pressure, but I don't think this is such a huge deal. If nothing else it legitimizes bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-06-14 15:21:31
The problem with this is that anything they do to "lower their hash percentage", they can undo. They will probably spread their hashrate somehow, but as long as they still control the hashrate, it makes no difference, besides maybe calming the community a bit. 
Since they have proven they will let their hashrate go above 50% there is no excuse. Ghash.io and CEX need to go down, they need to be taken out somehow, removed like a cancer. How, I don't know unfortunately...free market and all. Ultimately something might have to change at the protocol level, but until then I know I won't do business with, help or support anyone that has anything to do with these people. It's a drop in the ocean, but what else can I do. I already mine with a small pool.

IOTA and most other shitcoins are definitely in a bubble, bitcoin however is not. A lot of people don't understand the value proposition of bitcoin and think some other shitcoin might be the next bitcoin. It won't be.
IMO bitcoin is severely undervalued and most other cryptos are severely overvalued.
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:36:44
"The crypto-currency hit a high in December 2013, when each one was briefly worth more than **$1,100 (£700)**.
Since then their value has dropped steadily and each one is now worth about **£228 ($357)**."
Anyone else find it funny how they use the dollar value for the peak price, and the pound for the current low? It's most likely just an oversight, but it comes across as a bit dishonest. Anyways, it's no biggie, at least we didn't get the usual spiel about drugs, mt.gox and money laundering. All in all it was a good day for Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:06:41
How about forcing non-participation for all the links over at More than half the links over there are basically linking to this subreddit without np. 
I don't understand why we can't link to relevant discussion or use cases for bitcoin elsewhere on reddit, and then follow the link to give input or info regarding bitcoin, usually with benign intentions, when is basically just a subreddit dedicated to bullying and mocking this subreddit. Right now I count 17/25 on their frontpage without np. That shit needs to stop imo.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:15:22
Not sure if they are legit, so can't answer your question sorry.
Regardless, why buy from them though, when you can buy that same Antminer S3 (todays daily deal) directly from  for a much lower price, and knowing for sure you will receive what you pay for?
And as always, remember to always do detailed profit calculations before buying any mining equipment, most deals out there are actually no good for ROI. Good luck!  
@_date: 2014-06-05 14:52:35
That was the most painful thread to read through. The guy hammering the point about USD and EUR being backed up by gold makes me cringe. 
Wildstar looks kinda interesting and I would try it if they accepted bitcoin. On second thought though, if the people in that thread is a fair representation of their playerbase, I might just...not. Jesus christ, some people are so narrowminded and hateful...these people are in for a rude awakening. 
Someone should show them the ebay CEO talking about bitcoin, maybe that will open their eyes a little.

If it turns out the US/JP government has covertly stepped in, put a gag order on Karpeles, seized/frozen his wallets and databases, and is now investigating (silk road ties, money laundering, etc.), would you still hold him responsible?
If that is the case, I would certainly hold these government agencies responsible, not him. 
All I'm saying is, there's a lot at stake and powerful forces are in play. Don't be so quick to judge.

I have noticed that almost all the links in are direct links without the np (no participation) prefix. I'm all for critical thinking and hearing two sides of every story, but that really just leads to massive vote brigading by people who...eh...really really hate some voluntary currency system that others like. Yeah go figure. 
Look at the crazy downvoting in this and many other bitcoin threads. It's like it's their job or something...  
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:10:41

@_date: 2014-11-25 14:28:49
I would tend to agree, but in some cases these requirements are only revealed to the customer after coins have been deposited and is required to withdraw. Then it really becomes a case of comply, or lose your funds. This kind of practice should not easily be excused by "Then don't. Nobody is forcing you."

I agree with your point and have nothing against other cryptos, the market will decide. 
But tipping a quarter of a cent is just spam and useless clutter though, specifically to promote the coin you favor. Tip a real tip, or don't tip at all. That's like, my opinion, man.
@_date: 2014-11-20 19:17:16
So you want our bitcoin, but you want to keep it all hush hush? yeah, no...it's like that girl that wants your D in private, but won't even look at you in public. Fuck that.

Anyways, good for Belgium!
@_date: 2014-06-16 03:04:15
I guess that depends on how many miners would point their ASIC hardware towards this new bitcoin.
If bitcoin were to start over today, with the exact same protocol, and all existing hashrate would be mining it from the start, it would reach the current difficulty nearly instant I think. The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, and adjusts so that one block would be found approximately every 10 minutes. Since the hashrate these days is so huge compared to what Satoshi started out with, the first adjustment would come extremely quick, and we would be back to where we are now before you knew it.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:33:22
The government seem to be realizing how conveniently trackable Bitcoin really is, especially combined with KYC/AML at the entry and exit points of the bitcoin economy.

It really isn't that paranoid. I just think there's a mix of people, a whole spectre so to speak. Some of them are most definitely paid to detract and spread misinformation, but some have legitimate concerns. Bitcoin is not perfect and we need a healthy discussion, but to think there is not a single paid detractor in here is naive beyond reason.
This thread certainly has the guys coming out of the woodwork that's for sure. I think there are more bitcoin detractors in this thread than actual bitcoin enthusiasts.

How is this a trivial fact? I would not be able to continue a friendship with someone I knew was knowingly involved with a ponzi scheme.
For all we know, he might feel it is crucial to the survival of their friendship to convince his friend that bitcoin is, in fact, not a ponzi scheme. Just a thought :)
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:47:38
That's not what I wrote though is it? How did you reach the conclusion that I think it's sad that somebody is interested in reading what i write?
Anyways, I meant the sad part is a subreddit entirely dedicated to dissing and bullying another subreddit. If you look at the history of some of the most dedicated trolls from you'll see that some of these guys literally spew their hate 8-12 hours a day. That's pretty sad in my eyes. I'm fine with them not liking bitcoin, but why the intense and dedicated hate?
@_date: 2014-08-20 17:34:54
I would have to agree in this case, but sometimes the bot does serve a useful purpose. 
Also, seeing that more than half the front page of that subreddit is filled with direct links with no np prefix, and links that are directly and specifically mocking the entire subreddit should be reigned in, or given a warning of some sort. Of course I think they should be able to continue their "work" and critique of bitcoin, but the vote brigading and focused assault should stop.
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:00:16
I agree. Their $50 Steam wallet codes costs $51, so that's effectively a 2% fee, but otherwise the service is awesome. 
I used it for 2 x $50 cards yesterday, and the wallet codes arrived in just under half an hour, both on the actual payment screen, and to my email. IIRC they require 2 confirmations.

You are right, he didn't mention any of those things, so there's a good chance he was just talking about loyalty points and other centralized currencies.
Still, the topic and question was about Bitcoin at the time, and I posted it wanting to hear other redditors interpretations of what he said. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.
For what it's worth, I would probably store, and use, a small to medium amount of Bitcoin in my PayPal wallet if that became an option.

I think it's pretty clear that someone like you would be a valid contributor indeed. So unless you are spewing hate and trolling which you aren't by the look of your history, then my post wasn't about you and you shouldn't feel targeted.
I read too, and there's some good/funny posts, but plenty of humorous misconceptions there as well. I just don't feel the need to make snide remarks about them or question their intelligence. Please understand that I'm not against good debate and a critical view of bitcoin. Just the really intense haters that spend hours on end, trying to discredit bitcoin in any way possible, and the blatant vote brigading that happens when do the direct links to threads.
And seriously, I'm just advocating for a bit more civility from the Buttcoiners. My thinking is hardly the source of most oppressions in the world.
@_date: 2014-09-12 07:52:06
A lot of the news has been about merchant adoption. When new places to spend bitcoin emerges, bitcoiners will spend their coins. Most of these merchants use Bitpay or Coinbase, which means the coins usually get sold instantly on the market causing downwards pressure on the price. This is at least part of the answer.
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:30:09
It might not be about spam, but that's what it amounts to. So in a world where Doegecoin was the most popular crypto, we would have to wade through an extra 800 posts to have one guy get a dollar tip? 400 posts of the actual tip, and 400 "wow so verify" posts. So you see, the combined sum is really not the same. It's going to get spammy man.
A quarter of a cent is just a shit tip no matter how you spin it. It's not worth the extra clutter and time it takes to wade through. Again, just my opinion.

While I agree with the principle of not forcing your opinion on others, this is celarly not what is happening here. Bitcoin not being a ponzi scheme is not an opinion, it's a fact. The definition of ponzi scheme is not applicable to Bitcoin, simple as that. 
Trying to properly inform someone who has their facts mixed up is not forcing your opinion on them.

I can't answer for or but I'll give you my theory in simple terms for you:
You have spent the last 4 days posting over 150 posts pretty much all apologizing for Ghash.io. It is an unpopular opinion here, that's why you are annoying a lot of people. Don't stop though, you are entitled to your opinion and should not be silenced because your opinion is unpopular, just don't expect to be seen as anything but a shill for Ghash.io.

**I'll tell you why you shouldn't sell now. Because you don't want to buy high and sell low. That's how you lose money.** 
Bitcoin is stronger than ever and is not going away. Price is not the only measure of it's successs. The price drop I think is mainly from growing merchant adoption that's putting a great deal of pressure on the price as well as the fact that 3600 btc is being mined each and every day until the next halving. Still, more and more people are learning about bitcoin and have started using it, for whatever their use case is.
Think back to why you bought bitcoin in the first place (unless you're an idiot and you bought only to "get rich quick"), and you'll see that bitcoin is doing better than ever. All the fundamentals are still strong, it's moving into the mainstream. It's still an awesome technology.
Sell now, and you will have lost money or reduced your purchasing power. Hold, or better yet, buy more now to lower your average cost, and there is a good chance you'll come out on top. In a few years I believe you won't even have to sell your bitcoin, you can just spend them where ever you want.
Personally, I set a minimum time frame, before I will even consider selling or spending without replenishing the coins, and that is 6 months after the next halving. This is probably sometime late 2016, and I made that call a couple of years ago. I am still very confident that it was a good decision.
Bitcoin does have a place in this world, regardless of what the trolls think or say. It's working as intended right now, and there are some very real benefits, and some very real use cases where bitcoin is superior. It's up to you to decide if you will be one of the winners, or one of the losers in this historical rise of cryptocurrencies. If you sell now, you are really just cementing your place as one of the losers.
Sell now and guarantee your loss. Hold and you might come out on top. Bitcoin is still awesome and is growing, and price is not the only measure of its success.
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:59:18
"People are losing their minds..." THAT is exactly why it concerns me.
I am not a bitcoin developer, but yes I understand both the implications and the limitations of such an attack. I do research the technology I get involved with.
It doesn't matter if this is not a bitcoin killer, if it is perceived as a bitcoin killer, it can be. The problem is that the public will not even spend one minute researching and looking closer into bitcoin if this 51% issue is all over the news. It needs to be taken seriously for that reason if we want people to start trusting it.
@_date: 2014-06-16 03:34:38
That is a good point actually. I just think that there's a lot more to this story than we know at this point.
@_date: 2014-07-14 18:47:53
There's a lot of talk about Bitcoin, the blockchain technology and how that itself is so important, but bitcoin as a currency is much less important. I think they are missing the point. 
Without the financial incentive, or bitcoin the currency, the blockchain technology wouldn't be as widespread, or as safe, and really wouldn't work the same way. Bitcoin as a technology depends on bitcoin the currency imo.
It's almost as if some people are not willing to admit that they are into bitcoin the currency, only Bitcoin the technology, when they are really just two cogs in the same machinery, so to speak. Am I completely mistaken here?
@_date: 2014-09-11 17:37:49
Honestly, I think it was fine earlier, but it's just getting out of hand now. 
Before was a lighthearted poke at the enthusiasm shown in but lately it has become much more insidious and mean spirited, and the damn bot is appearing on pretty much every single post in this subreddit.
I just don't understand that a subreddit dedicated to mocking and harassing another subreddit is allowed. What would happen if someone made a subreddit dedicated to mocking and bullying f.ex. I can't even imagine what a loser one would have to be to actually dedicate so much time to hating on bitcoin, and I don't understand why their behaviour is tolerated.
I support banning the link bots from and any other measure we can take to ease the hate coming from these guys. Thanks.

Check out this "cynics" posting history, and check out his facebook. His life revolves around attacking bitcoin.
I wonder when people are going to stop being naive and realize that the PR war on bitcoin has already started. 
There are a lot of people and profiles out there that seemingly live and breathe for fighting against the adoption of bitcoin. These aren't your average Joes I believe, they are paid shills. It might sound paranoid, but I really don't think normal people without an agenda would be able to display so much hatred against a digital currency, if there was no financial incentive behind it.

I didn't mean it legitmizes bitcoin as an investment, becasue yes I agree, this does show how fickle and volatile the market is, for now. 
It does however legitimize it in terms of bitcoin not only being some "shady drugmoney vessel that only criminals use". It's not like they auction off a pound of coke when they seize that. Only legal and above board items/assets get auctioned off, the rest gets destroyed.
Personally I'm a "hold, spend and buy more" kind of guy, so I'm quite relaxed about the whole thing. At least we dont have to listen to the haters using the fact that the US gov. is one of the largest bitcoin holders as an argument anymore :P

The banks ultimately make that decision though, as you also stated. 
I don't feel it's right to absolve the banks of responsibility here. They could make an effort to adhere to regulations and make it work, they just choose the easy and risk free way out, ie. not dealing with bitcoin companies. I suspect a major reason is also because they fear the technology and it's implications. The banks don't want a future where bitcoin is ubiquitous, and regulation is a very convenient excuse IMHO.
Of course, if it was banned outright by government, then I retract. Can't blame the banks for that.

I think price is mainly "suffering" because merchant adoption has increased a lot and bitcoiners are buying stuff with bitcoin causing downwards pressure. This is not a bad thing. Bitcoin is doing great these days, price is not the only way to measure the success of bitcoin. 
Honestly, OP is pretty much just exclaiming that he is one of the weak hands and should never have invested in bitcoin in the first place. Who in their right mind would sell bitcoin today... that they bought in november? *smh*

It's borderline ridiculous how uninformed he was, and how unfounded his hatred for bitcoin was. He obviously has no clue and it's a mystery how he was even invited to that show. He didn't know ANYTHING about the subject lol.

I actually had my phone out to donate, as I like Mozilla and what they stand for. I went to their site, hit the donate button up at the top and couldn't find the bitcoin option. I then went to this thread to figure out what the deal was. The deal ended up being something I am not cool with and my phone went back in my pocket.
I wasn't going to donate to them just to promote bitcoin, but to reward a good company for great values AND to reward them for embracing bitcoin. Donating to them before was just never an option that crossed my mind, since traditional payment methods are just too cumbersome. Have you ever actually tried paying or donating with bitcoin from you smartphone? I like and use Mycelium for these smaller donations or purchases, and honestly, it shits all over every other transaction method. Simple as that.

Why dedicate so much of their day to trolling If they don't like bitcoin, why not turn around and focus on something else? Why spend so much time and energy on something that clearly is not for them?

Here in Norway (not a EU country), we have to pay 25% VAT, or MVA as it's called here, on gold and silver. The only exception is any gold or silver coins that have a face value and is considered legal tender somewhere in the world.
So for example, there would be a 25% VAT on a bar of gold, but a Canadian Gold Maple leaf would be VAT exempt.
Sorry I didn't answer the question directly, since Norway is not a member of the EU, but I thought it was relevant info. 
I'm cheering for our swedish brothers in the east, hopefully bitcoin will be recognized as a currency in all of EU, and the rest of the world will follow.

I'm not going to go through all the shit they did, but here are a few reddit posts that do a decent job at summarizing:
Edit: Sorry about the negativity, It just irks me when these people are considered insiders and experts in the bitcoin community as if everything they did is water under the bridge.

If you are genuinely interested, I would suggest doing your own research. They acted quite similar to BFL in many ways, but my personal opinion is that the BFL fiasco was mostly incompetence that kinda just escalated into criminal intent. In the case of KNC, it was criminal intent from the very start imo, which makes it that much worse.

To be fair, I pretty much agree with everything you have stated in your comments. I simply quoted a passage from the article I felt was important to keep in mind, and I disagree with your assessment that I was being short-sighted.
Another thing to consider is that throughout history, a lot of bright people have been on the right track at some point, only to miss the target completely later on in their careers.

The idea that there are two equal sides in this debate is pushed constantly from the BU/altcoin crowd. It's just not true.
One side consists of technical experts with vast experience developing Bitcoin, and have showed time and time again, that they have Bitcoins best interests at heart. On the other hand, we have the BU/Ver/Wu/buttcoin/altcoin crowd promoting buggy software and absolutely idiotic ideas, like EC giving miners more power.
Please stop pretending that there is some kind of debate between equals, it's insanely frustrating. It's clear as day that this is a deliberate attack on Bitcoin and must be handled as such. This entire "divide" is constructed and we are about to be conquered if we don't react accordingly.

Yes, the Jupiter was quite good for us in the first batch, no doubt. The problem for me started with the Neptune and the 2 for 1 deal, as well as a bunch of other things. Seriously, they were selling cloud mining contracts, on customer hardware, while we were still waiting for delivery. They used us, the customers, to finance their giant mining farm, after they made a promise they wouldn't do exactly that.
Just read through the evidence on reddit and bitcointalk, check the countless screenshots of "customer service" chats, forum posts. etc. etc. You either haven't done your research, or you're an employee/family member of KNC. In the slim case you are none of those, and you really can't see how they did anything wrong, then you should have your moral compass looked at, because it's fundamentally broken.

Not sure if you are being serious here or what? 
He *literally* explained in the interview how he changed his position on this in late 2013...and Shapeshift was founded shortly after.
He was also part of the S2X attack and then dragged his feet implementing Segwit. 
He is a snake in the grass in my opinion.

Sure he *was* a great asset to bitcoin, until he wasn't anymore.

Your 14 posts defending Bitgold in the last 10 or so hours really makes me wonder about your motivations.
I do have bank accounts, and I understand the "value" of KYC. The problem here is that Bitgold knew enough about their customer to take the 10k, but suddenly needed more for a withdrawal. This is what people don't like.
Add this to their ridiculous policy of accounts being "inactive" after 60 days and you have a company that you should avoid. 
You want to avoid criticism on the internet as a company? Be honest, and do the right thing. Simple as that.

I honestly have no idea mate. If I claimed I knew these things, your alarm bells should be going off ;)
I do however think that the best indicator on when the pump is over is when the largest exchanges allow BCH deposits, as I strongly believe that to be the start of the dump. A rather big dump actually.
Personally I'm just waiting and will assess the situation for now. My private keys are safe and I can split and sell off BCH whenever I want, but I don't want to do it on just any exchange, and while the platforms are under heavy load/stress and is prone to failure and glitches. 
I guess I just don't have the nerves for that kind of stuff anymore. I think I aged like 10+ years during the first 2-3 crashes in bitcoin.
Good luck with your trades :)

If I felt that your shitcoin was a scam, I would just avoid it. If I really wanted to attack it or stop it, the burden of proof would of course be on me to prove that it is in fact a scam. If I really cared that much about your coin that is.
You calling USDT a scam, lands the burden of proof on you. This is quite literally how this works.

Well, this response just solidified my stance on never using or recommending Bitgold. I'll also warn anyone, whenever I can, to not use this service.
It's all good when deposits are made, but when the withdrawal request comes, then it's always the same story. Bullshit excuses and hiding behind KYC/AML. It's almost comical how stereotypical this behaviour is in the bitcoin space.
Shame on you Bitgold, and shame on you Melanie for actually taking this opportunity to boast about your user growth instead of solving the issue for your customer.

Anyone can claim or decide whatever they want, it's still not Bitcoin. It's an altcoin. 
There are no opinions or feelings involved here, it's just an objective fact. Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and it follows specific consensus rules. Breaking these consensus rules and forking off, makes it, objectively and factually NOT bitcoin. 
How is this so hard to understand?

No, they don't have to prove a single thing to me. They don't owe me shit. But if you're asking if I'd want proof of them having the USD for me to use them, then hell yes. 
I think this is where you get confused to be honest. Look, I don't like, trust, or advocate for USDT. I personally wouldn't trust it at all, maybe even with any kind of audit. This is besides the point. The point is that you are accusing them of being a SCAM, and therefore the burden of proof is on you. 
Your choice is to use them, OR you can walk away and not use their "product" or "service" sure, but they don't owe you any insight into their business operations unless the law or regulations say otherwise.
When you are throwing out accusations, and want people to accept your word as the truth (ie. "USDT is a scam"), the burden of proof absolutely is on you, no matter how you look at it.
If you can't understand such a simple concept, I'm not really going to waste any more of my time to discuss this. 
Have a good one.

@_date: 2017-08-22 17:27:22
Best estimates indicate around a doubling of tx/sec, so still not enough for small purchases/transactions. This is also if all transactions are Segwit transactions, which they won't be immediately after Segwit activation. Every wallet and service have to actively implement it and send Segwit transactions, as it is voluntary to use, hence the soft fork.
The real game changer is the LN that comes after. We'll see true instant transactions for pennies. The future is bright, if we can just fend of this B2X bullshit.

@_date: 2017-08-17 16:43:12
It seems you don't understand the controversy. 
Simply put, they presented the 2x/btc1 software as the "segwit upgrade" without mentioning that this could cause them to be on a forked chain with a potential loss of funds. 
It was dishonest and deceitful. If they had clearly laid out what the software actually was, and what potential consequences running it could have, it would be less of a problem.

Honestly, I think you, and those people who you described as pissed, are just victims of propaganda. 
Bitcoin is actually going to be used as both a store of value, and for everyday transactions. It's just that the latter will be done through the Lightning Network or using similar layer 2 scaling. It's the most logical and sensible way to scale bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:45:02

You should direct your frustration towards Roger and Jihan then. They have been blocking these much needed upgrades for a while now. If it wasn't for their shenanigans we would most likely have had Segwit for a while, and LN would really be starting to shine. Instead we are in the current situation.
I honestly think fees will still be high in october, and I think it is very likely that on chain transaction fees will just increase as time goes by. Hopefully we will see mass adpotion of LN and we will finally have instant bitcoin transactions for next to nothing. 
In a few years I don't think many normal users will be transacting on chain at all, but rather using LN.

Well, I'm no arbiter of truth, but I think they are just another attack on bitcoin, like we have seen before with bitcoin classic, bitcoin unlimited, bitcoinXT, bcash, and so on and so forth. They are attempts at undermining the real bitcoin, and dividing the community. They almost succeded, but thanks to the vigilance of the bitcoin community, and our highly developed bullshit detector, we fended off the attack and are seeing new all time highs.
These attacks won't stop though, and all we can do is prepare for the next one and just keep improving the real bitcoin, and our community, in ways that make it even more resilient. 
Despite these attacks we are in pretty good shape right now with Segwit due to activate, and the Lightning Network being worked on to really take bitcoin to the next level. 
We won't let them take bitcoin from us, no fucking chance :)
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:50:18
Nobody knows for sure when proper fee relief is coming, because it will take some time to implement LN and convince people to use it. Segwit itself can potentially give som fee relief, but it's really LN that's the big game changer imo.
The reason you're not getting a direct answer, is just because nobody has one. It's not some cover-up or conspiracy.

No, it really wasn't.


I wholeheartedly disagree. In fact, I feel that you had a responsibility to stand with the other *actual* bitcoin maximalists and reject and denounce that scam, but you didn't. Instead you further "legitimized" it in the eyes of many and wasted valuable time that you obviously needed to implement Segwit.


Then you guys made a horrible business decision by prioritizing the Bcash scam and garbage ICOs, and dropping the ball on Segwit. 
I used to see Mycelium recommended everywhere before. Everyone, including me, used it. I used to recommend it to all my friends that I introduced to BTC etc. None of this is true anymore.
We're almost entering 2019, and not having implemented Segwit is just inexcusable for a wallet company, and a clear indication that they have their priorities all messed up.


Massive and ridiculous strawman. I'm not American, I don't have any prejudices against people from those nations, and I didn't write anything that indicates otherwise. 
I have to be honest, that was unprofessional as fuck, and further cemented my stance on your company. Good riddance.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:16:34
Well, since they are pivoting away from Bitcoin, this should be expected. No reason to list altcoin wallets on bitcoin.org.

Why? Why does it bother you that others are using a technology and valuing it highly?
Besides, you are objectively and factually incorrect. The value of one bitcoin is currently around $6400. And that's just one type of value. To some people around the world Bitcoin is actually invaluable, because it has properties that allows them to circumvent bad financial policies, capital controls, and extreme inflationary currencies. Just because you don't need or want it, doesn't make it have no value. I implore you to open your mind and actually try to understand why millions of people love Bitcoin. 
Basing your opinion on something solely based on its usefulness to yourself is pretty selfish and narrow minded. 


OK, I just looked through some of your posts in r/bitcoin, and I fail to see any "debate in serious fashion" at all. You're just a hater spreading negativity with mostly shitty one-liners. Care to point out where you engage in ANY debate in "seriouis fashion?"


Who cares if you do or not? Millions of people actually do use it and find it useful. We don't need you pollute our community with snarky one-liners and vitriol just because you don't want to use it.




This is asinine. What are you supposed to do with a physical coin or bill to enjoy it "at home"? Or how are you enjoying the digital numbers in your bank account? Piss weak argument that's not even an argument really. So that's all you got?
Here's what I think. I honestly think that you can't wrap your little head around the technology, and as a result you don't understand the value proposition at all, and therefore you are angry at it and attack it. Seen it a million times before.
Typical human behavior, but still doesn't make it any less pathetic.

Yes, I think it would be a wise investment, but be ready for volatility and consider it a long term play. Remember if it goes down a bit, you haven't actually lost anything until you sell. Just be patient and don't act on emotions.
Also, make sure you buy actual Bitcoins, and not some altcoin. There are charlatans and bad actors out there trying to pass off altcoins as bitcoin. Due diligence, my friend!

It's fine to support 2x, that in itself is not being a bad actor, as long as you are pushing for replay protection and making sure there is no confusion about the fact that 2x will not be bitcoin, it will be an altcoin.
Those who support 2x without replay protection are indeed bad actors. 
Those who try to hijack the bitcoin name and network effect, through confusion and obfuscation, are bad actors.
And specifically, Bitpay, are bad actors, because of the deceit in their blogpost (see the rest of this thread).

The fee itself doesn't really tell us if it's proper or not. What matters is satoshis per byte.
Your transaction is probably made up of dust transactions and is very large (not in monetary value, but in bytes). This is most likely your problem.

This is just my opinion of course, but I feel Gavin had good intentions, but was naive and gullible. That, or the CIA really compromised him and he went full retard to protect Bitcoin. Either way, it doesn't look good, but it's nowhere near this level of maliciousness.
Garziks insane corporate takeover and attempt to "fire Core" and basically replace bitcoin with their centrally controlled altcoin, is way more malicious. In face of all the solid argumentation, Garzik still refuses to implement proper replay protection and his reasoning is that it will be harder to become "the real bitcoin".
In my eyes Gavin is naive and somewhat clueless, but Garzik is straight up malicious and his actions have far worse consequences for bitcoin.

Well, all the good computer scientists, engineers and people who actually know how the bitcoin protocol works, agrees that a blocksize increase is not safe right now. So if these people believe that increasing the blocksize is somehow a good idea now, in the face of science, they are no better than flat-earthers or climate change deniers in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:50:07
Dollar amount of the fee doesn't matter, only sat/byte. In the current fee market, yours is slightly on the low side.

First of all, 90% of miners will never just leave Bitcoin. Even if many pools are signalling for 2x now, there are several factors that basically guarantees that we won't lose 90% of miners. 
Pools are comprised of many individuals. If these pools are looking to fork off to an altcoin, many individuals will swap from that 2x pool, to a bitcoin pool. 
Also, signalling is far from actually running code that breaks consensus. Many of these miners talk a big game, but they will follow the money and the competent devs.
Another, perhaps smaller factor, is all the old miners who would fire up their old rigs just to support bitcoin. Personally, I would fire up my old KNC Jupiter and Neptunes, I'd fire up some Antminer S4 and heck, maybe I'd even fire up my old collection from Butterfly Labs lol. My point is, lots of people are willing to fight for Bitcoin in the face of an attack.
Don't underestimate the Honey Badger. If you think Bitcoin will be abandoned for a corporate clone, and you trade accordingly, I think you are going to get burned badly.
If you haven't read [this]( yet, I would recommend you do so.

122.967 sat/B for that transaction.
That should normally be all good, but right now the network is very congested and you need pretty much 350+ sat/byte.
We will soon have Segwit activated and then the LN network will take some time to become ubiquitous. When this happens, Bitcoin transactions will be close to free and instant. It's a game changer, and it's coming soon. Until then, Bitcoin works best as a settlement layer or store of value unfortunately. Small price to pay for the greatness that is to come :)
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:34:51
No, it's beacause we didn't get Segwit sooner. You can thank Roger Ver and Jihan Wu.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:09:17
I'm sorry, but it's clear that you don't understand it if you think Segwit2x has been activated. **Segwit** has been locked in and will activate soon. Not Segwit2x.
There will be plenty of hashpower to mine bitcoin, even if a good chunk will start mining the 2x altcoin. 
That's the thing a lot of people don't understand: Bitcoin will continue to be Bitcoin, regardless of what you or these other bad actors "feel" or "think" their altcoin will be.

Don't sell yourself short mate. It's not luck. You were smart enough to realize the potential in bitcoin early on. Millions of people have heard of bitcoin and never took the time to research it properly or had a narrow mind and was unable to grasp the importance of the tech. You did, and now you profit. 
You are being a great provider for your family and I can agree that maybe THEY are lucky to have you, but what you have done with bitcoin is not just luck :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:22:14
I'm not sure you understand the controversy. Them supporting bigger blocks is fine, although misguided, they are entitled to their opinion of course. The problem is the dishonesty and deceit. 
Simply put, they presented the 2x/btc1 software as the "segwit upgrade" without mentioning that this could cause them to be on a forked chain with a potential loss of funds.
It was dishonest and deceitful. If they had clearly laid out what the software actually was, and what potential consequences running it could have, it would be less of a problem.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:18:49

@_date: 2017-08-04 15:01:20
It's simply to avoid confusion. 
Of course it's not a good idea to have a clone called Bitcoin Cash, it will cause confusion and lead to loss of funds for new people trying to get some bitcoin. Many will end up with a different cryptocurrency they did not intend to buy, and which quite frankly is rather useless compared to bitcoin. It's seriously obvious to all normal bitcoiners, why can't you see this?
bCash is an acceptable name. I will never call it Bitcoin Cash lol
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:28:06
Of course you always want to know the other sides argument, that's a given. If however, the argument is debunked by bitcoin experts again and again, then it's just spam and propaganda.

What exactly is inevitable?


2x is not coded by Jihan. It's mainly Core code with some changes made by Jeff Garzik as I understand it.


I have already chosen: Bitcoin
Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin after any potential forks. I don't get why people don't understand this simple concept. You can't change the consesus rules causing a fork, and then pretend it's somehow Bitcoin. Even if 90% of miners leave to mine this 2x coin, Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin and 2x will be an altcoin. Apparently this is a tough reality to face for some people.


We should always go for the best technical solutions, and disregard all politics. I trust Core to always put the safety and reliability of the network first, regardless of the many calls for political and populist compromises. That is exactly why I support Core 100%

I don't think any exchanges allow deposits yet, so the only coins to trade are the ones who were split into existence on the few exchanges that trade it.

@_date: 2017-08-21 16:10:19
Nobody can really tell you when a good time to buy is, and if they claim they can, they are lying.
I just want to warn you that bitcoin.com is being run by a former politician that is very hostile to bitcoin. It's a propaganda site that shills for other cryptocurrencies and is generally not trusted in the bitcoin space. I would stay far away from it. 
Many sockpuppet accounts will most likely contact you and tell you that r/btc is the real bitcoin subreddit, but the charlatan running bitcoin.com is also running r/btc. It really is a very unfortunate situation, and that is why I feel it's important to warn you.
You can most of the time tell that they are sockpuppet accounts and shills by checking their post history (r/btc is a red flag) and very often they will be tagged redditor for 0 days, up to a few months.
You shouldn't trust what I'm saying blindly though (of course), but just keep it in the back of your mind and try to notice what I'm talking about, and make up your own mind. Good luck out there, it's a fucking jungle. [Enjoy!](

@_date: 2017-08-16 19:14:38
Quite possible, yes. Maybe even higher to be honest, as this fork has more thought and planning behind it compared to bcash.
Although this might sound good, since you will practically be getting free money for just holding BTC, I think if a 2x fork occurs, it will have a greater negative impact on the actual BTC price as well.
It's impossible to say really. I would position myself so that you have access to your BTC privkeys, so you can get your 2xcoins as well, and then just either sell asap for instant profits, or hodl on to them in case the markets act irrationally and the price actually goes up.
For instance, I believe bcash is absolute garbage, but I have not sold them yet, because I have a suspicion that the chinese government is involved and there might be some help coming  their way. I'm waiting it out to see, and will do the same if 2x forks off. If there's one thing I have learned from almost 6 years in bitcoin....it's stay calm, hodl, and think everything through 3 times before acting. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:15:31
Honestly, don't accept his information as good. He is a known propaganda account.
The truth is that Core has been protecting Bitcoin from hostile takeover attempts for years. Segwit2X is the newest attempt. It is an attempt to wrangle control of the development process out of the hands of the original cypherpunks/decentralists, and into the hands of greedy corporations.

Ok, it just didn't seem that way since you lumped them in as a "browser based wallet", which to most users means custodial wallets. Blockchain.info never have access to your private key, and therefore can't run off with your bitcoins. Your point about malicious javascript is true on pretty much every bitcoin related site on the internet I guess.

See, the problem is that "the community" didn't strike any deal, it was a bunch of corporations who struck a deal behind closed doors. 
There is very little actual community support for 2x.
We should rather just wait and see how the Segwit update plays out and analyze the effect on the network and then, if analysis supports it, do a well planned and safe HF to possibly implement a blocksize increase and perhaps other improvements and upgrades.
The only disingenuous thing here is the blogpost from Bitpay.

Bitcoin is working well, no problems or interruptions, and price is climbing. 
on Aug 1st. a chinese comapny called viaBTC decided to fork off and create a clone of bitcoin that shares the transaction history up until that point. Everyone who owned Bitcoin had/has the opportunity to claim their bCash.
A minority want to call it Bitcoin Cash, but obviously the bitcoin community is not happy with this as it causes a lot of confusion.
bCash is the name used for this new altcoin and the ticker is BCH. They have even become so desperate as to make a bot for when users type BCH or bCash (it will probably come and try to "correct" me here actually :P)
For some reason the people over at r/btc have embraced this altcoin and is pushing for it to become to real Bitcoin, something that is pretty much just a joke to most people following this. Bitcoin is Bitcoin and will continue to be Bitcoin, no matter how many clones appear.
This was just a quick and simplified recap of how I see the situation.
TL;DR: Bitcoin is still working great, and is unaffected by this new altcoin called bCash (BCH).
Edit: Happy cake day! :)

Nothing wrong with the paper, my problem is with your blatant exaggeration of the conclusion. It's very very far from "ironclad evidence".
You might want to read the paper again, and note the words and phrases used, such as: 
- "substantial support for the view that price manipulation ***may*** be behind substantial distortive effects in cryptocurrencies." 
- "These findings ***suggest***..."
- "...but ***can*** substantially contribute..."
Now, there might be some shady stuff happening with Tether, I honestly don't know, but the way this report is being used by media and bitcoin-detractors to claim it's "ironclad evidence", is nothing short of disgusting and way more manipulative.

Word of advice: Spend less time listening to "cash enthusiasts" if you want to learn about Bitcoin lol
Very simplified explanation: 
Segwit is a long awaited upgrade to bitcoin that separates out the signature data from bitcoin transactions so you can fit more transactions in a block. This is a scaling solution that will both give immediate relief in transaction throughput, but also pave the way for other much more interesting scaling solutions and improvements. Look up Lightning Network, Schnorr signatures, etc.
Segwit is thoroughly reviewed and tested and is a massive win for the bitcoin network and community.

The fact that you are using Mt.Gox to somehow try to prove that Bitcoin is a Ponzi is hilarious. You are either misinformed or just saying this to garner a reaction (trolling).

Well, the dumb scaling that bcash is trying is never going to get close to the smart scaling we will see on Bitcoin with Segwit and LN. 
Simply increasing the blocksize is an extremely crude and primitive way to scale a network like Bitcoin, and since bcash has no advantages over bitcoin, except the fact that nobody really uses it and blocks are almost empty, I think BCH is doomed. The only reason it's sometimes more profitable to mine, is because the price is being propped up and pumped by bad actors like Ver.
BCH is pretty much a garbage coin for suckers.

But anyways, If you don't find it useful, don't use it. Bitcoin cares not. I find it useful, as do many others. The fiat price of bitcoin is volatile, sure, but the long term trend is up. Violently up.
I can tell you gold, silver and the US dollar don't appreciate multiple orders of magnitude over a few years...
As the market matures and volatility decreases, it will become more and more useful as a currency. Until then it is plenty useful as a long term store of value and for borderless, permissionless and censorship resistant payments.

Talk to your bank, see if there is a problem on their end, and talk to the exchange to see if it's on their end.

Sigh, more false equivalence bullshit from someone thinking that letting an altcoin that forked off with around 10% support, is somehow an equal side of a "split community", is being neutral. That's not being neutral, that is actually being ignorant of the history of bitcoin.
Look, there is Bitcoin, and then there is a bunch of altcoins. BCash is really not special in any way. The only thing that makes it "special", is that the people that support it are doing it in extremely deceptive and unethical ways.
Another thing. BCash is a not a utility token, it's just a currency token, so when you state that you'd "*love to see a future where both coins succeed on their own merits*", it just shows that you don't understand the first thing about this revolution. We really don't need another currency token at all, we already have bitcoin.
Your entire premise for the article is flawed, so it's no wonder your article is so full of straight up bullshit. I mean, come on, that first graphic even shows Bitcoin splitting into two chains, when in reality Bitcoin just kept being Bitcoin and some people forked off. It's extremely disingenuous to present it like that. You claim you're being neutral, but we can all see that's not true.

The 10% was just an estimate, based on polls at the time, market price, sub counts and general sentiment gauging in bitcoin forums. The point is that it was *around* 10%, but you make it out to be a situation where half the bitcoin community suddenly started calling some altcoin the real bitcoin, and the community split in two; and that's just wrong. 
It was not a split, it was just a chinese miningpool company that decided they wanted to fork bitcoin and create an altcoin. They only gave a few weeks notice before the fork, if i remember correctly. Since they catered to the big block scaling solution, that had previously been rejected in the FOSS process by the bitcoin technical community, they already had some support. So from there, they just started on a marketing spree with sockpuppets and pay-per-retweet campaigns to try to smear the core developers and claim to be the real bitcoin. Now they are squatting bitcoin domains and social media handles while promoting the idea that their altcoin is bitcoin. The deception and unethical behavior from that camp is astonishing.
 &gt;You realize they think the same thing about you, right?
You realize flat earthers think astronauts and scientists are in on a conspiracy and the earth is flat and not a globe, right? Sometimes one side of an argument is just flat out wrong, regardless of how anyone feels. It's the same here. BCash is not bitcoin, and it never will be, because it forked off and doesn't follow the bitcoin consensus rules. That's just a straight up fact, just like how the earth is proven, confirmed and undeniably a goddamn globe.


Bitcoin is still bitcoin, regardless of how many forks happen, there was no need to have that split in the graphic. It's exactly the kind of graphics being pushed by BCash sockpuppets on twitter. Anyways, it might not have been intentional, but it added to the general picture of a full split of the chain, and community, that I think you falsely portrayed. 


I never claimed to be neutral though, I'm a long time bitcoiner who  sees this whole BCash thing as another attack in a long line of attacks. If they had just forked off, taken a non-confusing name and stopped claiming to be the real bitcoin, I would have no problem with them.
I honestly don't see you as the enemy in any way, but I do think you have fallen victim to some good marketing and deceptive tactics.

@_date: 2018-06-13 20:26:06
Yes unethical scammer. If you promote the BCash scam and want to pump it, aka sell it to newbs, that's really what you are. Hard pill to swallow huh. 
Maybe you could just stop promoting a scam, then people won't call you out on it.
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:18:06
All shitcoins are severely overvalued as usual, and Bitcoin is still undervalued as usual.

I'm not sure who is the cancer tbh...
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:13:24
Not a single shitcoin have the same immutable property that bitcoin has. That's just a fact. 
If you don't understand why Bitcoin is infinitely more important and valuable than any other coin or project, you don't really understand the value proposition of bitcoin at all.
There's Bitcoin, and then there are shitcoins. It really is that simple.
@_date: 2018-10-16 16:24:53
One of the oldest and most trusted bitcoin exchanges.

I see the term "decentralized" is being used extremely liberally here. Most, if not all, of those shitcoins are completely centralized.

Sorry man, I honestly have no experience with the DNMs, it was just kinda obvious from your comments what you wanted to do haha.
There is actually a dedicated subreddit for the DNMs though, but can't remember the name atm, you could try asking for advice there :)
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:12:57
Good thing it's bullshit and this new cycle of "omg tether" FUD is clearly an organized effort to drive BTC price lower. There has been like 12 FUD articles about this posted in the last few hours alone, most of them by shill accounts.

Pick one :P
IMO, he is not dumb, just a dishonest, lying salesman who is trying to fend off this thing that's coming to eat his lunch. I think it makes him an unethical scumbag. Of course, ethics are subjective, so that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-06-08 15:03:36
You might not be a hater, but you are spreading misinformation and lies that come from the people *who are actually* trying to compromise and undermine Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:32:39
Best advice is buy bitcoin, store it safely. Replace if you have to spend/use them, otherwise just hold them long term.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:13:19
...or experts in the field, depending on how you look at it. That's how I see it anyways.
Besides, you can just read it yourself and make up your own mind. If you can't understand it, have someone who does understand it, and that you trust, read it for you.
Technically, I see no incorrect information in this article.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:17:01
Still FUD though...just that stakes are higher and the players are bigger.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:10:07
Nice try, but totalitarianism, is a form of government that allows no individual freedom and that seeks to subordinate all aspects of individual life to the authority of the state.
You might as well push Bitconnect on to unsuspecting people, it's just as scummy as what you're doing with the BCash scam.
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:07:40


Then you have much to learn.
@_date: 2018-06-05 17:05:39
No you are using the wrong terms, possibly on purpose but nevertheless wrong. There is no price of "Bitcoin Core", because that is the name of a software implementation, not a cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency you are trying to mention is simply called Bitcoin (BTC).
Get it now?
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:26:28
I'm sorry, but I think you only believe that because you don't realize it's all a balancing act between decentralization, security and speed/convenience etc.
All these new projects are simply giving up too much decentralization an/or security to gain faster speed or lower costs etc. At this time the only project that is properly decentralized and secured, is Bitcoin.
So to rephrase, all the *meaningful* innovation is happening in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:03:22
People are offended because you guys are making an organized effort to spread FUD. You're all shill accounts.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:54:33
Why is your site whois protected? 
Why is there no proper contact info on your site?
This looks like a classic miner scam tbh, but if it's legit, you are really trying very hard to appear like a scam. I welcome any competition to Bitmain, but I just don't think this is it, sorry.
I would want A LOT more information and transparency from this "company" before giving them any money, and I advice everyone to hold off until more information is gathered. It's not looking good IMO.
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:12:59

One of the OG exchanges, very reputable and rarely hear about people having any trouble with them.
@_date: 2019-08-01 22:13:35
Not a bad summary, but one thing stands out:


This is a really bad argument, and I think you know it is, since you have put "scarcity" as a common property. 
Bitcoin can be forked sure, but then it won't be Bitcoin anymore and it doesn't dilute the supply of BTC in any way. This is just a technical fact and not my opinion. It is a very common argument from skeptics, but if you understand Bitcoin, you understand that forks and altcoins, simply aren't Bitcoin, rendering the point moot.
I agree that it is an educational hurdle for people learning about Bitcoin, but it's not actually an issue. If it's not bitcoin, the network will reject it, so forks and alts are irrelevant when discussing bitcoin scarcity.

What do you mean with "46% with Cash"?
Are you seriously adding the Bcash percentage to the Bitcoin one? That's honestly completely retarded, and you might as well add Dogecoin, Bitconnect, or any other altcoin to its percentages then.

You're undoubtedly one of the most insufferable anti-bitcoin trolls around, and it doesn't matter if bitcoin is rallying or dropping, you act the same no matter what.

I love Norwegian Air tbh. They always have cheap regular flights, and often some really good specials too. When you think "budget airline", a lot of people would think it's a bunch of old planes, but they have one of the youngest fleets of planes of any airline. I think the average age of their fleet is something like 4 years old. 
I love that they are venturing into crypto now. Good move.

I see Coinbase, Xapo and Andreessen Horowitz in that infographic, so I'm guessing Libra will have at least some on/off ramps to Bitcoin at launch. 
If anything, I think this facebook coin will help educate people on what actually makes Bitcoin so special and valuable, and it will make it easier to accept crypto as a concept for a lot of people.
I'm not going to be using it, and I don't particularly like it personally, but I can't really see how it will hurt Bitcoin in any way.
The only property it really shares with Bitcoin, is being digital..

You can see the funding they have received [here](
A lot of them are old school cypherpunks as far as I know, so their motivations are probably pretty altruistic to be honest.
At the same time they are developing projects and business models that depend on Bitcoin being as awesome as it can be, so they also have financial interest in its success.

That's exactly the thing though, you are promoting a shitcoin in this sub and that is against the rules. This is the Bitcoin subreddit, not some shitcoin subreddit.
Honestly, it doesn't matter if your coin is the best invention ever (hint: it's not), you're still breaking the rules by "promoting" it here.
As soon as a mod sees this you post will be removed and hopefully you will get banned or at least a warning.

It's pretty awesome as far as memes go, I have to admit :)

This isn't mentioned often, but it's something I have thought about too. This also makes sense of the fact that Gavin Andresen bought Wrights bullshit, since he is also believed to be compromised by CIA, which again probably was the reason the real Satoshi went into hiding. 
Who knows though, and I guess it doesn't really matter for Bitcoin in the long run, but it's still fun to play around with these conspiratorial thoughts. Bitcoin is stranger than fiction. I love it!

I'm no fan of Facebook or Zuckerberg, but he is not an idiot, and only complete idiots would want anything to do with nChain and Faketoshi.
Craig Wright is a fraud with mental illness, and BSV is a completely irrelevant shitcoin. There is absolutely no way Facebook or any other large company will ever do anything with BSV. It's all just hot garbage and will continually lose ground, and value, to the real deal, Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-25 16:32:44
Use a real exchange, like bitstamp.net. 
Then do a normal transaction from your blockchain.com wallet to your exchange deposit address, then sell your coins (if you really have to ofc.) 
This way you will at least get a decent rate, won't get fleeced, and you're not supporting anything that scammer Roger Ver is involved in.
@_date: 2019-06-13 13:57:35


Why not exactly?
BTW, transaction fees aren't a set amount, and never will be. It all depends on how quickly you need it confirmed, and the size of your tx in bytes. You set the fee you are willing to pay. If you're not willing to pay the fee to have your transaction included in the next block, someone else is. Working as intended.
How are things over in rbtc anyways?
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:21:42
Yeah fair enough, the charts always look pretty grim at the low part of these cycles. 
After having been through quite a few of these cycles, it gets easier to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Also remembering the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin, and seeing how that is still intact, and in great shape, usually helps me get through it without getting too pessimistic. Keeping track of technical developments and exciting projects in the space is also a great way to gauge how bitcoin is doing. Price isn't always the best indicator of the health of the technology/project.
Anyways, I hope you stay with us :)

Maybe you should have bought some Bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:57:38
The reason the price in dollars is widely discussed and used as a measure, is simply because we are measuring the purchasing power of bitcoin; and the simplest way to do that in 2019 is in USD, as it is the most widely accepted currency and is relatively stable worldwide.
Just because we measure in USD, doesn't mean we will sell BTC into USD when we want to purchase something, it's just an easy way to measure the purchasing power of BTC. See [this]( classic meme :P
This will probably change with time though, as the USD will most likely lose its world reserve currency status at some point (they never reign forever.)

I wouldn't use a Bitcoin ATM unless you really have to for some reason. 
You're way better off using a real exchange that will give you the real exchange rate. I'm not aware of any Bitcoin ATMs that won't rip you off with the exchange rate or the fees, and most likely both.
If you really have to, the process would be something like this: Click sell BTC, send BTC to address(QR code) shown on screen, wait for confirmation, ATM spits out cash.
You most likely have to do some kind of ID verification though, depending on the machine.

You are being misinformed. There is moderation of course, like most useful forums, but the party-line bullshit is just laughable conspiracy theory. Trolls get banned for repeatedly breaking the rules, that's basically what's happening.
Anyways, I see you get all your information from the bcash sub, so no wonder you were misinformed lol. 
@_date: 2019-06-23 17:01:54
Let's say you bought 0.15 BTC when the bitcoin price was $8k.
You paid $1200 ($8000*0.15) and the bitcoin price has now risen to $10700. 
Your current holdings are now worth $1605 ($10700*0.15).
Your profit is current value of asset minus your cost price of asset. So $1605-$1200=$405. Your profit in this scenario would be $405.
I'm not sure if this is the information you were looking for, since your post could also be interpreted as *"Where in the coinbase interface can I see my profit?"*, but hope it helps.

You can always spend and rebuy. This lets you HODL, while stimulating BTC economy and growth at the same time :)
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:15:37
Bitcoin really isn't slower from one day to another, there is just more transactions competing to be included in the limited blockspace, and the fee you set got out-competed. You can always get your transaction included in the next block as long as you pay enough.
A more accurate statement would be that Bitcoin seems popular today, and therefore more expensive to transact with.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:31:27
The fee is high in dollar terms, but relatively low in terms of sat/Byte.
My recommendation is to take this as an opportunity to learn how bitcoin transactions work on a more technical level.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:37:46
I'd probably use Greenaddress or Bread before using that wallet tbh. 
The post about businesses to avoid using is probably not as relevant now as when the fork was still on. Now it's more of a "lets punish these companies for supporting the contentious fork", but their products will probably still work fine with Bitcoin.
The best advice I can give you without going too much into detail is trust bitcoin.org and the information you see there, and **DO NOT** trust bitcoin.com. It is owned and run by a known criminal and scammer named Roger Ver.
What the other user said below is pretty good info. You could very easily sign up with Coinbase and quickly buy some BTC, then you should probably send it to your own wallet, either on IOS or egt one of the hardware wallets he mentioned (Trezor or Ledger Nano S)
Good luck, and obligatory [welcome to Bitcoin]( :)

For whatever it's worth, this account looks like a farm account that's just posting random stuff to look organic and accumulate karma. You can see in some of the more elaborate "comments" that they are copy pasted from company websites and/or textbooks, using "our" etc.

You want to invest in Bitcoin right? I assume so, since you are posting this in r/Bitcoin.
[Here]( is a selection of wallets for IOS, straight from bitcoin.org. Pick one of those and you'll be alright. The fork has pretty much been called off for now, so you'll be fine with any of those.

If you want to improve Bitcoin, submit a BIP. There is a functioning process in place. Just because a lot of scaling suggestions have been shot down doesn't mean the process is not working. It means they were bad scaling suggestions.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:44:39
Real quick:
If your transaction has X inputs and Y outputs, the transaction size will be (in bytes):
    X*180 + Y*34 + 10 plus or minus X
But just read up about Bitcoin transactions, outputs and inputs and learn how to create your own transactions. It will be worth it imo.

The premium is not fixed though, it's just market driven, and is expected to fall when more options hit the market.
Let's say you buy GBTC today at a 30% premium or whatever it is. Then after a while bitcoin has appreciated 15% but at the same time many other options become available in your brokerage account and the GBTC premium drops to 5%. If you had bought bitcoin, you'd be up 15%, but holding GBTC would leave you in the red.

You'll know a crash when you see one ;)
But to answer your question, which will only be my guess of course:
I think the price of bitcoin will be higher 2 weeks from now, so you would be better off selling then, but if anyone tells you they know what is going to happen, they are lying.

No worries, and I agree.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:04:46
Think of it this way:
As a bitcoin newbie, there is not a single question you can possibly ask, that hasn't been asked and answered at least ten times before. A lot of the questions newbies ask are very loaded and based on false premises (often from info attained over at the bcash sub) so they get a negative reaction.
When you then complain about these negative reactions, you will just get more negative reactions, because complaining about this and the moderation here, is exactly what Bitcoin detractors and altcoin shills have ben doing for years.
Just use the search bar more, and if you are asking questions like "The guys over at r/btc said xxxx, how is this not a real problem or concern?" you're doing exactly what i described above and you will get negative reactions. 
If a lot of the newbies would follow some simple posting guidelines they'd cop a lot less static. simple things like: Always search first, Ask less loaded questions, and definitely don't get your information from r/btc and claim it as fact here, or try to base a discussion on the premise that said information is true (hint: it almost never is).
Hope this helps in any way.

Look at that chart, and you can see there has only been 2 blocks mined in the last couple of hours. It's kinda rare, but really just normal variance.
A bit of bad luck in your case that this should happen right when you broadcast your transaction though.

I just did, and it's as dumb as your other posts. What is your point exactly? 
Of course it corrects after huge parabolic increases, but are you encouraging people to try to time the market or what? The price has ALWAYS surged higher after a correction, so the safest and most sensible position will always be long, AKA HODL.

There is a difference between being conservative and not wanting to recommend Bitcoin in a conservative portfolio, which is totally fine, and just straight up banning anyone even mentioning Bitcoin.

Just because some people were ready to call some shitcoin Bitcoin, doesn't make it so. They are just delusional, and as we see, they came to their senses in the end.

I obviously understand that. I know how this works. I have never stated such bullshit either, so why put words in my mouth? 
It's the fact that they might rename an altcoin as Bitcoin. That is the problem, and it plays right into the hand of the attackers and is not acceptable. The attack is also a fight for the "public perception" of what Bitcoin is.

I have my doubts. You have been on reddit for 4 years and accumulated like 30 comment karma, and only just today started discussing Bitcoin? I just don't buy it, sorry.


How is it vigilante justice? It is literally someone [cleaning up trash from the streets]( Would you feel any different if the posters were using the Bitcoin logo, and described Bitcoin, while linking to the OneCoin scam? This is really the same thing, it's propaganda designed to misinform the reader into making investments into Bcash, thinking it's this new thing called Bitcoin that everyone is talking to.


How is it not intentional deceit? Explain to me how someone posting flyers with the description of Bitcoin, using the Bitcoin logo and then trying to divert yo over to some altcoin page? **It's textbook malicious intent to deceive.**


Mature exchange? You make it sound like we are two equal communities having an honest battle of opinions and fighting some equally just war. This is naive and harmful thinking. We are under attack and these people are using ever dirty trick in the book. We are trying to mitigate damage here, not inflict it. Why would we want any "exchange" with these Bcash scammers? We just want them to mind their own business and if they are honest about what Bcash is, then there is no problem. This was a blatant attempt to trick and defraud users, if you can't see that, maybe your moral compass needs a little tuning.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:42:15
Yeah, I understand what you mean, and I do understand where you're coming from. I just think it's the wrong time to be neutral and fence-sitting. I really appreciate it when companies come out with a clear no-bullshit pro-Bitcoin stance, like f.ex. Samourai Wallet.
Essentially it just boils down to the fact that I simply don't agree with your position. As a consumer, I can choose to not use your product if I'm not happy with the product or the company. In this case I just wanted more clarity before I made that decision, and I was frustrated because I had a hard time getting this clarity...for the second time actually. 
Anyways, I'm still not happy with your position, but so be it. I'm not in charge of Bread, all I can do is not use the product. Good luck going forward.

I don't really possess the relevant information to be able to predict that accurately. I don't think anyone does.
Historically though, the best time to invest in Bitcoin was 8-9 years ago, but the second best time is right now. If you believe in the long term prospect of Bitcoin, I think it's safe to buy whenever really.
But I just don't have a crystal ball. Sorry mate and good luck :)

Really? Please enlighten us.


Thats just the result of nobody using the shitcoins you think are better. If they were as popular as BTC, they would have the same scaling problems, most likely worse.


Otherwise it makes no sense.
BTC is booming because it has the most promise out of all the cryptocurrencies. It has the best devs and the best scaling plan, and there is currently no cryptocurrency even close to it.
I'm curious, can you name a few of these coins that you think are "better" than Bitcoin and why?
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:00:37
There are and will be many more altcoins/tokens that serve different purposes, but the world, or society, really only needs one that takes the role of "store of value/Gold 2.0" so I'm betting on Bitcoin all the way.

@_date: 2017-11-07 18:04:00
Any realistic condition. Jesus, is it really that hard to not be vague?
Bitcoin is Bitcoin, and it has a specific set of consensus rules. Any coin that doesn't follow these consensus rules is NOT Bitcoin. Ergo, S2X is not Bitcoin. Despite of this, it seems like you might call S2X Bitcoin regardless, if just enough miners mine it. That's the message you are putting out here is it not?
Why can't you just answer the fucking question?
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:47:40
Yes I did, did you read what I said? I said nothing about "protecting your funds". 
I said there is a chance they will call S2X Bitcoin, depending on what the miners do, which is a fact.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:35:08


But...What does that even mean? How is it dependent on fiat currency, or USD as you said, for its value?
Right now, the de facto world reserve currency is the USD. Almost everything is priced in USD. How does f.ex. a gold bar "depend on USD for its value" just because it is priced in USD?
Bitcoin is a new asset class, being both a commodity store of value and a currency. It's only natural that its relative worth be measured in USD until its no longer natural to value things in USD.
I'm honestly trying to understand the point, or question, you keep repeating, but it just doesn't make much sense, I'm sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:38:01
I normaly like and agree with a lot of your posts, but here I think you are flat out wrong.
It is absolutely a good and necessary thing to call out scammers like Roger Ver in any way we can.

@_date: 2017-11-07 18:44:02
I know it's a hypothetical, but I would never find myself in that situation. In that specific scenario, I'd be pretty screwed, since I plan to dump the S2X altcoin as soon as I possibly can (like most Bitcoiners according to the futures market). So in this scenario I'd be out of the game pretty much, and would have to make a new decision to invest in some other coin, starting from scratch. It's a very unrealistic hypothetical tbh, so it's hard to really imagine this happening, especially BTC going to $0.
Anyways, to give you an answer: At this point, yes, I'd still be upset if a company started selling altcoins under the Bitcoin name. It just isn't Bitcoin, simple as that. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:49:52

Yes, spreading lies in the Bitcoin subreddit, to pump altcoins, will get you hostile responses. Should be expected tbh.


And Craig S. Wright presented himself as Satoshi himself, but that doesn't magically make it true.


Facts suggest otherwise. It has a fair bit of traction, and it is a chinese clone of Bitcoin. I'm not sure why you would deny facts, but Bcash is a creation of viaBTC, a Chinese company. Not that it really matters what nationality the scammers are, but facts are facts.


Using Gavin to increase credibility just shows how out of touch you are with the Bitcoin community. He has lost all credibility long ago. His "stamp of approval" would have the opposite effect on a projects credibility at this stage. Maybe not for everyone, obviously, but for a lot of Bitcoiners, that's the case.


I wouldn't even care about this "entire group" if they weren't dishonest and scammy, trying to co-opt the Bitcoin name for their own scammy clone coin. If they would just call it something else and change the address type, we'd be golden. The fact is that the  Bcash "group" is trying very hard to become the real Bitcoin in very shady and dishonest ways. If you want to be associated with these scammers, go ahead, but don't be surprised when you encounter hostility when trying to pump your shitcoin in r/bitcoin.

Someone rejecting segwit and layer 2 scaling, despite it being the best scaling options we have, and instead wanting to do it all on chain, is either a troll with an agenda, or simply doesn't understand the challenges of scaling bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-15 13:27:30
I, and many others, call it Bcash, because we don't want any confusion with the real Bitcoin name. It was stupid to name the forked altcoin anything with Bitcoin in the name, and it should be expected that the bitcoin community would react by calling it Bcash. 
You could say that I'm anti Bcash, but you cold also just say I'm pro Bitcoin.
It's always going to be Bcash, and there's not a single thing you can do to stop us from caling it Bcash.

Buy Bitcoin.
If you want to profit on alts you'll need to be very immersed in the markets and know when pumps/dumps are happening. There is no alt that is likely to outshine BTC on technical merits, so I wouldn't recommend getting into alts at all.
One of the "rites of passage" of being a Bitcoiner is getting burnt on alts, and then coming back to good old Bitcoin. It happens all the time.
You now have a chance of bypassing that stage and the loss that comes with it. Buy Bitcoin, avoid the alts.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:03:36
Bitcoin has a lot of potential for growth I think. 
It's not unimaginable that at some point every single person on planet earth will own and use it in some way. Who knows what the price of one BTC would be then. A lot I guess.
I imagine the final form of bitcoin being this huge liquidity pool that all people, devices, organizations and corporations are connected to in some way or another. Sidechains and lightning hubs, and whatever else the future brings, will provide an interface to the extremely secure and precious layer 1, that is the original Bitcoin chain. At this point it's not crazy to think one unit on that original chain would be extremely expensive, it's would basically be 1/21,000,000 of the world economy (very simplified ofc).
So yeah, It's probably not a bad idea to hodl on to some Bitcoin, just in case ;)
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:54:54
There is no reason to discuss why Bcash can't be real Bitcoin. It simply can't, in the same way Ethereum isn't going to become Bitcoin. They are two different coins, with different consensus rules. It's just never going to happen.
That's not to say BCH can't become viable. I don't believe it will, but there is a chance. It still won't be Bitcoin though.


Nope. They really are just delusional, and you'd do yourself a favor understanding this. Stop taking in all the FUD. The only reason you're seeing this increase in spam and FUD from Bcash shills, is that the S2X attack failed, so now they are getting desperate. They counted on the S2X havoc to somehow elevate BCH.

@_date: 2017-11-07 21:58:00
It's not only about what individual computers can handle, but also about propagation times and orphan blocks. 8MB or 32MB is a horrible idea because, simply put, it will increase centralization for very little benefit.
The increase in bandwidth and resources used is huge, basically rendering a large part of this beautiful decentralized network unusable. This is not an acceptable trade off.
Another thing to consider is that a 32MB blocksize would increase the blockchain size at an incredible pace, making initial sync a nightmare and the increased storage requirements would, once again, hurt decentralization.
Then there is the issue of block propagation. Chinese miners, who are already behind the great chinese firewall, would essentially get an advantage over miners everywhere else, further increasing cetralization.
I could go on.
The most important feature of Bitcoin, is that it's decentralized. Without that, we might as well just use a database at a bank. We need to keep it decentralized at all costs. Increasing the blocksize is a step in the wrong direction for decentralization, and therefore it has been widely rejected in the Bitcoin technical community.
There's a lot more to this, but I suggest you go back and read a lot of the arguments of the Bitcoin Core developers throughout this whole drama. You will find that they are not "stalling Bitcoin" in any way, like some people might have you believe, they are protecting it, and shielding it from random people with unsound technical ideas. I honestly implore you to find out who the people behind Bitcoin Core really is, and what their values are. I think you'll find it's very different from what the typical narrative is over at r/btc. 
Good luck in your research!
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:40:50
Umm, I think you need to stop getting your info from r/btc and scammers like Fake Satoshi. A node that doesn't mine is not a useless parasite. That statement is ridiculously false.
So a Bitcoin company running their own nodes to validate the 27 million they do in BTC transactions every year is a useless parasite? Of course not. 
I honestly think you just need to open your mind a little bit and listen to what people are telling you. Every answer you get in this thread you counter with: "That's just nonsense" or something similar. Try to learn instead of refuting stuff that doesn't go with your r/btc narrative.

I think you just recently started paying attention, because these guys have been bad news for Bitcoin for a while. And still are, even though they cancelled their attack.
When they realized that defeat was inevitable, they just retreated so they could come back and fight another day. They will attack Bitcoin again, and we will be there to fight them off again.

There is absolutely no excuse to ever call Bitcoin anything but Bitcoin. It's especially bad to name it anything with 1X, pretending it's somehow equal to, or competing with, the 2X scam. 
These things matter and they should be called out when they make mistakes. Maybe you don't care, but others do, so you can shove your "duh" up your 2x.

I don't get it. Are you now saying my conclusion is incorrect? Are there no scenarios where Bread would call the S2X chain Bitcoin?
Do you not understand that it doesn't matter in ***which*** scenarios you would do this, but that you would actually do it ***at all*** is what matters?
Did you actually expect and want a long list of different scenarios that could play out to answer yes/no to?
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:42:48
Don't listen to this advice OP. Newcomers to crypto always think they will find the new altcoin and make a killing. They usually end up wrecked. I would recommend sticking to Bitcoin.

Fair enough, but I can tell you right now: r/btc is not really interested in what's best for Bitcoin. If you haven't already noticed it's mainly comprised of altcoiners and Bcash folks. It's a very bad idea to put these two communities as equals and look at the info coming out of them as equal. They are not.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:00:55
No they didn't. Bitcoin Cash is a chinese clone coin, who is only created to try to leech off of the real Bitcoins name, manipulate the market with pump and dumps, and fool newbie investors into investing in Bcash, when they want to invest in Bitcoin.  
Bcash has a technically inferior scaling plan and is generally backed and pumped by scammers and opportunists. It's a small fringe group of disgruntled technically illiterate idiots who doesn't understand that decentralization is the number one trait that gives BTC value. 


I agree, but so are all the previous altcoins trying to hijack the Bitcoin name, especially Bcash.
You "Satoshis' Vision" folks are embarrassing yourself, honestly.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:11:59
I think part of it is the market is reacting to the rapidly declining support for S2X. 
Only a decentralized BTC is valuable. Now that it's clear that S2X is just going to be another altcoin and BTC will continue to be decentralized, people are betting on BTC. This combined with the prospect of a free altcoin airdrop in S2X of course.

Look, yeah Bitcoin is expensive to use right now, but this will be fixed with layer 2 tech like LN. Meanwhile, keeping the system decentralized is a lot more important than facilitating cheap transactions. 
The fact that the transaction is happening in a way that can't be censored and with money that can't be seized, THAT is the important thing. 
People are obviously willing to pay the current price for that. If they weren't, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

@_date: 2017-11-08 16:19:10
That's exactly what someone siding with the attackers would say. 
What u/readish has been saying and "spamming" in these last weeks have been very important to spread the truth through all the propaganda.

That's because you are new to Bitcoin, and clearly don't understand it yet. Sorry, but that's just the truth.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:18:23
It's incredible that you have such strong opinions about something you obviously know so little about.
Do you not realize that there are no shitcoins that scale better than bitcoin? They have the same issues, it's just not apparent yet, because nobody is using them...because they are shitcoins.
Bitcoins are relatively cheap for what they provide. Transactions that can't be censored, with money that can't be seized. Sure, I'd like the fees to be lover, and they will be, but it's not as bad as you want it to be.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:06:12
I actually agree with you here, but I think we owe that to the great job a lot of the community members have done spreading awareness and refutring lies and propaganda. Just like u/readish has been doing for weeks.
People like to call Bitcoin anti-fragile, but it only has this property because we, the community, are part of Bitcoin, and make it so.
Bitcoin doesn't have some magical property making it anti-fragile and immune to everything on its own. We have to actually fight for it to be anti-fragile. We, the community, are a part of what makes it anti-fragile.
I'm sorry we can't count on you to help in this very important fight, but please stop trying to get in our way while we try to fight back against this attack. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:55:20
Yeah I get it, and I should probably try harder to separate my emotions. I've been in to Bitcoin for about 6 years and it has changed my life. I owe so much of the positives in my life to Bitcoin, and it's hard for me to not become emotional when it's under attack (You might not agree that it's an attack, but that's how I perceive it, and many others do too obviously).
Anyways, thanks for the chat. I'll update my RES tag for you after this somewhat civilized exchange, and try to contain my emotions better. Have a good one ;)

In the extremely unlikely scenario Logical007 proposed I would have misjudged the market completely and would be pissed at myself, as well as the S2X movement for attacking Bitcoin successfully. 
Then again, it would be fair to say the Bitcoin experiment would be failed if S2X succeeds, so it would be pointless to argue about.

Yeah for sure I'm long BTC. 
I'm what we call a hodler around these parts. Used to be a miner many years ago, but offline storage is the name of the game these days. 
Oh, and I also spend Bitcoin, but always try to accumulate more. I don't really trade and don't know much about, or believe muc in, your "technical analysis" to be honest. If it works for you, kudos.
I wasn't really trying to offend you, just more tongue in cheek. I mean, it's not uncalled for calling you a try-hard in TA. You don't need to dig too far into your post history to see evidence of that ;)
Maybe it was out of line calling it tea-leaf analysis, but I'm sure you'll live.

Sensationalist title, no need to blow this out of proportion. Bitcoin is not broken, it is actually working as intended with a functioning fee market. 
Thats not to say there are no problems with bitcoin. In my opinion we need to address two main issues in the short term:
- Many wallets and clients don't have the required functions to calculate or adjust fees, leaving the users unable to participate successfully in this new fee market. They need to be updated across the board so fees can be adjusted manually or even  automatically.
- We need to raise the max blocksize limit (!)

@_date: 2017-11-07 21:39:39
Just continue running Bitcoin Core nodes and continue using Bitcoin. There will always be miners mining Bitcoin.
If a large portion switch to mining an altcoin for political reasons, we will just have to wait it out for a difficulty readjustment. This should cause some disruption, but we'll get through it. Miners switching to altcoins will suffer economically, and they might just find their greed stronger than their political convictions and come back.
I don't believe in a emergency POW hardfork to be honest. I think it's a bad idea, but I'm open to one with more planning.

It scales worse than bitcoin, and is centralized.

@_date: 2017-11-07 21:25:19


Plan with what? I can try to enlighten you, but you have to ask more specific questions.


r/bitcoin doesn't censor, it moderates. There is a difference. r/btc is actually worse when it comes to blatant censorship, while they are more inconsistent with moderation. I think your experience says more about the kind of questions you ask, and what they are suggesting, than anything else.
What specific things can't you mention because the post turns into flaming? Have you considered that it's not r/bitcoin that is wrong, but you? Maybe your ideas are so bad they deserve to be flamed. I dunno, I'm just asking, but let me know what ideas you don't think you should mention, and I'm pretty sure I can tell you why you are getting flamed.


The future of 1MB is not really worth discussing, because the 1MB limit is just arbitrary and can be changed at any time if done the right way with consensus. I doubt we ever need to increase it much at all to be honest(but don't really know at this point) with L2 tech like LN in the pipeline. Being against the Segwit2X attack, is not the same as claiming we never need to increase the blocksize. I don't know if we should do that at some point, but I sure as hell know that we shouldn't do it now in this way. NYA is a horrible precedent to set, and if they somehow miraculously manage to win and hijack the Bitcoin name and BTC ticker, Bitcoin will be finished. There is no point in using a decentralized payment network and store of value if a handful of CEOs can change it at will.
About scaling: There is no chance to scale Bitcoin to a globally used currency (VISA levels as many like to call it) on-chain. It's just not practical, feasible or something we want. It's a non starter. That's why we need to scale with layer 2 tech. Because of this simple fact, it would be better to keep layer 1 as secure and decentralized as possible. Hence the resistance to NYA/Segwit2X.
Alienating miners is not really a concept that is relevant. Miners can choose to either mine Bitcoin, or not. They don't have a say in what Bitcoin actually is. They can choose to do the work we want them to do, or choose not to, that's really it. A lot of your misconceptions stems from the bad information you are obviously gobbling up over at r/btc.
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:34:17
You certainly can't promote it, but we have always been able to talk about it if it was in relation to Bitcoin. This has always been the case.

While I don't always agree with what Preston Byrne has to say about crypto topics, I think [this]( blog post covers the topic of Ethereum centralization pretty well. 
TBH, I think Ethereum has a lot of problems, and I don't think it has a bright future unfortunately.
That being said, I do own some ETH for shits and giggles, and think it's an interesting concept, I just think a lot of it's functionality will be built on top of Bitcoin in the end, rendering Ethereum kinda useless. I guess you could call me a BTC Maximalist, a position I have slowly arrived at after 7+ years in crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:38:35
I agree with one amendment:
Bitcoin ***and it's community*** is antifragile.
I think it would be a mistake to think that Bitcoin all by itself is antifragile. Bitcoin itself didn't fight back against S2X, the Bitcoin community did. 
Do not underestimate the actions of the thousands of users who contacted companies, wrote letters, tweets and posts on reddit and other social media. These things really work. They provide companies with a very real metric of support/opposition. We made it clear for these people that the cost of supporting S2X would be very high.
Good job everyone. Today is a huge day for Bitcoin and our growing community :)

Yes, seriously.


Like I stated in my other post, you'd need to time a pump and dump to actually make money on shitcoins. I never said you couldn't make money on it, but you'd have to either be lucky, or be part of or join a pump n dump.


I'll call shitcoins shitcoins all day long. Nothing you can do about that.


Maybe that's true, but we'd have some kind of warning before this happens. This new coin taking over would have to have some serious advantages over Bitcoin, and there just isn't any coin like that today.
I can tell from your post history (Ark, NAV, Neo, etc. etc.) that you are going to get fucking rekt in the crypto markets, like most other newbies. 
I don't really care how you lose your money man, but I'm honestly just trying to help. Some people just don't want to listen to experience, and would rather learn from their own mistakes I guess. Fair enough, I suppose, and good luck to you.

I love calling out moron bullshitters like you.
1. You have sold all your BTC and now you are just trolling like a desperate piece of shit (just check history)
2. You only ever post about vertcoin and ether, why are you here?
3. You can't measure a fee in USD alone, you have to look at the sat/byte.
4. Fees would be a lot lower today if the miners hadn't blocked progress for so long.
5. LN is coming, this will alleviate/solve this "problem".
6. A few dollars is a small price to pay for sending a transaction that can't be censored, with money that can't be seized.
Please, just stop this constant tripe FUD. You are so transparent, it's like you aren't even trying. Go troll somewhere else.

Core is not dictating anything. They are providing software that a lot of people like using. There is no problem with groups of people releasing software and trying to make people run their version. This would have been the case with Segwit2X as well, but without replay protection this software interferes with previously mentioned software. Now we have a problem, and now we have an attack.

People, including me, have been saying for years that ALL cloud mining contracts are at best unprofitable, and at worst outright scams.
 
It's proven a great way to throw money down the drain. No exceptions.
If you want to mine, you need to do due diligence and do thorough calculations to see if you'll be profitable. Unless you have very cheap electricity, chances are high you won't be.
Buy Bitcoin, secure your coins off exchanges and HODL. Spend and replace as needed. Profit.

That might be correct, but personal freedom is more important than mainstream acceptance and our trip to the moon. 
Drugs and prostitution are not things that I personally use, or something that play any kind of role in my life, but they shouldn't be illegal. 
Drug addiction should be treated as a health problem, not a criminal problem. Furthermore, prostitution should most definitely be legal and regulated. This would have a positive effect on the lives of the prostitutes, as shown in various jurisdictions around the world. 
People should not be persecuted just because a few powerful people feel a sense of superior morals. I'm willing to postpone the moon expedition, if it means that oppressed people have a way to fight for their freedoms using bitcoin.  /rant

I think you could give a clear answer to my question. Let's cut the bullshit. There are scenarios that would make Bread list S2X as Bitcoin. I know this, and you know this.
I think you are afraid of a "gotcha" moment where I get you to say/admit "yes" to my answer, and you probably fear that I go and make a new post or somehow take it out of context or blow it out of proportions and paint Bread in a bad light. What you should really do, is stand behind you decisions and stop being vague. If you want the miners and market to decide what is Bitcoin. Say that, and stand behind it. Stop slithering around.
That's honestly the best advice I can give you. Sitting on the fence, or being neutral, is often the best stance for businesses, but there are exceptions, and this is one of them (IMO).
Anyways, I hope Bitcoin prevails and Bread continues to be a Bitcoin company. Your product is good, and I'd like to be able to still recommend it, but you are making it very hard.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:33:35

People like that guy you are replying to is talking out of his ass, and is pretty much part of the reason why we need strict moderation. 
Everyone wants to promote their useless altcoin in here, and that is obviously moderated/removed.
Look at his post history, he is a Stellar shill, and is only whining about "censorship" because he is upset he isn't allowed to shill his irrelevant shitcoin in this sub. It would be quite comical if it wasn't such a problem for this community.

Anyways, your fee of 17 sat/byte is way too low right now. The mempool is being spammed again so you'll have to pay more to use the Bitcoin network.

It won't really replace on chain transactions per se, as LN needs on chain transactions to open and close channels, but it sure has the potential to replace the majority of regular day to day spending transactions.
LN heavily follows Metcalfe's law, so it will be more valuable and useful the more people adopt and use it. 
I think the future is bright for Bitcoin and the LN...as long as we keep layer 1 decentralized and robust. That is the main and most important thing IMO, and that is why I oppose any hard fork block size increase, until we really really have to, and we have all the data needed to make that decision.

I don't think you understand. You have already answered the question, and the answer was "yes". 
There is a chance that Bread will name the S2X altcoin as Bitcoin.
I don't need a bunch of answers to different scenarios to understand that. You already indicated that there are scenarios where you would in fact do that. That's absolutely all anyone needs to know to make a decision to dump you. 
Anyone who would take some shitcoin and stick a Bitcoin label on it are bad actors in the Bitcoin space. There is absolutely no wiggle room here. Thank you for making this choice easy.

Just because you don't understand why we eventually need high fees on layer 1, doesn't mean it's not so, it just means you don't understand...
Layer 2 scaling is the only way we will ever be able to scale for mainstream adoption, while keeping the core properties that make BTC so useful and valuable. 
There is just no feasible way to scale layer 1 so that billions of people can use it for everyday transactions. It's just not going to happen, and this sounds like something you just need to realize and come to terms with to be honest.

Yes, but the legalization and regulation would most likely make it harder to operate with involuntary sex workers. I don't think the problem will ever go away, no matter what we do, but I think legalization is definitely a step in the right direction.

@_date: 2019-04-05 19:04:49
Well to a certain extent you are right, there is nothing wrong with pushing an altcoin, if you for some reason think that altcoin has any advantage over Bitcoin, but it's all bout the way it is done. It's about the name chosen, it's about the methods and rhetoric used. That's where it becomes scammy.
Certain people spent a lot of bitcoin to buy Bcash, and certain miners started diverting mining power to mine Bcash, then turned their efforts towards heavily promoting it as the real bitcoin, taking advantage of newbies. Why not use a new name? Basically like Litecoin did. Nobody hates Litecoin or calls it scammy, but when you try to take advantage of the name confusion and buy up domains and twitter handles with the bitcoin name in it, and then use it to promote an altcoin, you're really stepping into unethical scammy territory.
So yeah it's all about the methods and rhetoric used, because like I said, because the code can't be a scam. But the people pushing Bcash are still scammers.
Are you saying there is nothing shady and unethical about these methods? I'm starting to think you are buying into their bullshit lol...

My statement was pretty much based on what i read in a Vice article where they interviewed sex workers in Germany, where it is legalized and regulated.
The girls seemed to praise the legalized status of their profession and the benefits and rights that came with it. I guess it could be good for some and would marginalize others though.
I suppose it could depend on how heavily regulated it is, because I'll admit, the scenario you describe doesn't sound too good. Thanks for the insight.

Blockchain.info does NOT have access to your private key. It is only ever encrypted/decrypted client-side. This was pretty much the main feature separating them from the pack and making them popular back in the day.

@_date: 2019-04-05 18:41:37
The BCash code itself obviously can't be a scam, since it's just that...code, but if you look into why Bcash was created and by whom, you'll understand that it's a very scammy project taking advantage of unsuspecting newbies in the space and it was only created to line certain peoples pockets. It takes advantage of the name confusion and relies on fooling users into thinking it's Bitcoin (BTC).
Proponents of Bcash go out of their way to push it as the real Bitcoin, heavily using sockpuppets and buying up domains like bitcoin dot com, and twitter handles like  and use them to push BCash propaganda. 
It's really a long and complicated story, that spans over multiple years, so I can't be assed going into all the details here, but it's quite interesting if you take the time to look into it. There are a lot of money to be made in this space, and this attracts a lot of scammers and charlatans (see Roger Ver, Craig "Faketoshi" Wright, Jihan Wu, and more...)
Bottom line is: There is only one Bitcoin (BTC) and it is the original cryptocurrency that is the only sufficiently decentralized cryptocurrency, and it has the best and most dedicated developers, has the most robust and hard to change protocol, the highest security...and is currently worth around $5k. 
The other altcoins are honestly just irrelevant noise.

It is seriously grossly dishonest to compare these two subs as equals.
The two subs are like NASA and Flat Earth Society, sure they deal with the same type of subject matter, but one is actually technically correct and deals in facts, while the other is not. 
Their scaling suggestions went through the same BIP process as others, but was rejected on technical grounds. The fact that they don't understand the arguments, doesn't make them invalid. Now they just try to undermine Bitcoin all day long.
You are simply being taken for a ride if you think they are somewhat an equal part in all this. I suspect taking you for a ride might not be so hard though, seeing that you are actually listening to Fake Satoshi.

Then you need to find a better site to get that information, or learn how to read the information properly, because it is objectively wrong. 
When I posted my reply, transactions with 2 sat/B fee were going through.
Up until approximately 2 hours ago, transactions with 3-4 sat/B were going through.
There has been a spike in the last couple of hours, and to get in the the last few blocks you would need 80-90 sat/B.
I'm not sure what your agenda is, or if you are just uninformed/incompetent/ignorant, but your information is just wrong. 
Looking at your post history I think I know what your deal is though, and it is seriously making me cringe. Get your shit together, and stop with the big block, anti-Core propaganda. You're embarrassing yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:58:21
And you need to realize that Bcash is centralized garbage that has no future, so there's that.
This post is really off topic in this forum though, and we should really not give those numpties any more attention.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:16:43
BCash scammer detected. How about you fuck off trying to promote your scamcoin here?
You might just be a victim of the scam yourself, and might not be smart enough to realize that you're being used, but that's a reality you're going to have to face one day.
Edit: Ah I see that you edited out your Bcash promotion. LMAO scammers gonna scam, until they get called out.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:49:19
People who are worried about this, simply don't know how bitcoin mining works. The only drop in hashrate we need to worry about, is a huge and instant drop, making the system slow until the next difficulty readjustment period. 
This is literally insignificant.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:42:24
So you're willingly submitting clickbait articles and openly admit to it huh?
Well fuck coinchaser then.
I'm going to tag you and everyone who posts this clickbait rag, and downvote it every single time. 
Actors like you can't be flushed out of this community fast enough. 
FFS, if there is one thing we don't need more of in this space, it's clickbait blog-spam...
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:04:06
lmao, did you just call me a perv?
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:53:30
Just another shitcoin really...and those are off-topic here.
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:26:08
As soon as you revealed that you think Bcash and other shitcoins and forks dillute bitcoin in any way, any credibility on this topic is lost. 
Only Bitcoin is Bitcoin. The alts don't matter.
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:16:12
It seems like you are engaging in good faith now, so that's at least good, but I have to be honest with you....what you just said really says a lot about you as a person, and not in a good way at all. 
Are you really that petty that you like "kicking" people just because they are excited about a tech you don't like or respect? Or they have made some money on something you missed out on? Either way, there is no "perspective" here that doesn't make you look like a massive douchebag. I could understand it if it was like your buddy or something, but just attacking an entire tech community because you are "annoyed the markets are rewarding stupidity" is fucking asinine.
Seriously dude, get help.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:45:00
Then why mention him at all? Why give him attention?
@_date: 2018-11-20 16:45:09
Bitcoin has never been stronger than right now, in pretty much every metric, except the price in fiat. 
This is obviously a buying opportunity imo.
@_date: 2019-04-06 21:11:47
lmao, check out OPs history. He spent months farming his karma in a karmafarmer sub, and is now blogspamming all the crypto subs. 
Exactly the kind of user we want here in r/bitcoin amirite?
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:55:38


Doubt they would be buying into an obvious scam to be honest.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:40:34


You realize you can't actually believe anything that lunatic says, right? He is mentally ill.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:40:53
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:17:23
No idea to be honest, but out of the 10 years bitcoin has existed, you would be significantly up if you bought in any of the first 8.5 years, so I'm sure some are up and some are down. Surprise right?
Anyways, I didn't really comment on that, I just noted what an insufferable troll you are, nothing else. 
So, what motivates you to do what you do, and have you talked to a psychiatrist about it?
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:33:14
I'm perfectly calm. I just won't let you promote your scam here unopposed. 
Simple as that. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:28:50
It's all lies and propaganda. Stop being a useful idiot eating up all their bullshit lol.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:58:45
Didn't this guy get suckered in by the BCash scammers? 
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:32:00
I think it's safe to say it doesn't include insufferable trolls like you who only hang around r/bitcoin to be obnoxious.
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:14:01
That is not Satoshi. That is a mentally ill man with delusions of grandeur. 
Stop being naive, and stop referring to him as Satoshi.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:36:29
Obnoxious troll confirmed. You are material.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:18:11
Bitcoin is, objectively, and per definition, not a scam or fraud. This is just a undeniable truth and not even up for discussion. 
Many trolls and haters will of course say otherwise. The thing is, one could argue about how good an investment it is, how well it functions as a currency and what not. All valid discussions, but calling it a fraud/scam only serves to expose the ignorance of those claiming it.
The people calling it that is probably a pretty diverse group though. Some are just straight up trolls, who would troll any community, but is currently getting the most bang for their buck in this sub. Others are bitter and jealous of early adopters like you said. Others are quite clearly opposed to bitcoin because it will negatively affect their industry (think bankers etc.), and others are quite clearly paid to spread negative sentiment around bitcoin.
It's all good though, those who understand the tech and its value proposition will have the last laugh.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:06:43
And that justifies you constantly being an obnoxious troll in r/bitcoin how exactly?
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:16:46


Such an ignorant and narrow-minded statement. 
A lot of substances that society class as "drugs" are extremely beneficial to a lot of humans. You can grow tremendously as a person using psychedelics like LSD and Psilocybin, and that's not even getting into the clinical uses of these same substances to treat depression and anxiety, same with cannabis and MDMA to a certain degree. 
These substances can be abused of course, but they can also be used for tremendous personal growth, as well as treatment for a range of medical conditions. And these positive effects are not dependent on the drugs coming from your doctor either.
I think black and white statements like yours are incredibly narrow minded and shows you haven't been keeping up with modern research on "drugs". Luckily the younger generation seems to be pretty clued in when it comes to this subject, so it's just a matter of time before your outdated views go away.
"Drugs" aren't all bad...mmkay?
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:28:46
You're both being downvoted for even entertaining the thought that this is Satoshi lmao....and probably just for being r/btc numpties in general. 
If Satoshi was around, he wouldn't give two shits about Bcash, it's just some random alt-coin.
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:59:28
It varies from person to person, and depends on what baggage they carry around, what events have shaped them and so on. Here is a quote from Dr. David Presti from UC Berkeley that can explain it better than me:


Humans have used "drugs" since forever, for many different reasons and benefits, and it's only very recently on the total timeline that it has become illegal and taboo. Have you really never heard of anyone experiencing personal growth after a one time use of psychedelics?
I understand that it's hard to wrap your head around, since society has indoctrinated everyone to think all drugs are bad, but spend a bit of time really researching what kind of personal growth one can experience and have on these substances. It's quite fascinating.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:19:28
lmao @ unironically being a Ripple fanboy...
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:09:09
Fair enough, but yeah, check out Bitstamp. They are good, but it still might take a bit of time to get verified there, like all other exchanges these days.
@_date: 2018-11-15 23:41:51
I would just go ahead and make the upgrade to Ledger Live and THEN see if you have any problems. Why even care if this has a bug when the new release is already out and is amazing? :)
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:35:29
lol, you are still here huh?
Spending as much time as you do, in a forum for tech you don't use or like, can only be 1 of 2 things:
1. Your job.
2. Mental illness.
I feel sorry for you either way, and I hope things get better for you.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:03:20
There are like 4 other similar blog-spammers who beat you to it, and you still put "BREAKING" in the title.../SMH
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:48:05
It's a nocoiner troll, don't bother.
I honestly wonder why the mods let them shit all over our community every single day in the daily discussion. Are the mods on holiday or something?
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:12:49


I think there is just less money flowing into crypto these days, so naturally less Tethers are being printed. We are coming out of one of our typical hype-cycles and it's just natural that the flow of freshly minted tethers is slowing. 
I also think you have an unhealthy obsession with Tether and you seem hell bent on convincing everyone that BTC is overpriced, no matter what the price is.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:44:26
In case you haven't noticed you are having a conversation with a troll lol.
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:53:08
lmao, these guys really know how to pick the professional sounding names for their projects :P
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:55:05
That's the ticker for Bcash, just like BTC is the ticker for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:52:12

The *last* laugh huh? 
This won't age well.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:50:01
From your drivel? lmao, no.
I'm more curious about what makes someone like you tick, like what makes you spend so much time in a subreddit about a tech you don't use or like, being completely obnoxious?
It's actually a pretty interesting question in relation to human psychology, but feel free to continue being obnoxious, I wasn't really expecting a real answer from you lol.
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:08:06
If it makes you feel any better, he is a moron who lost a lot of money on....yup lol....[Bitconnect.](
For the record, I'm normally not a mean dude, and usually not of the opinion that people who are scammed are to blame, it's just that this seems to be particularly nasty, so fuck him.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:59:02
That is not Satoshi. It's not even up for debate, he just objectively and certainly isn't Satoshi. If he was, he could easily prove it. 
Stop giving this clown attention.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:09:52
That's such an ignorant statement. I have used bitcoin for many things throughout the years, and so have most bitcoiners I know who have been around a while. There has been a thriving community around bitcoin for years you know.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:35
Are you saying "nice insight" to your own article about bitcoin being dead?
lmao, seriously?
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:13:41
Can we please stop this insanity? 
I seriously propose a temp ban for anyone posting anything stemming from Faketoshi at all. 
This clown needs to be starved of attention so that he will go away already.
@_date: 2018-11-26 19:22:37


I think you spelled "obnoxiously troll the community" wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:19:38
How about Bitconnect? About the same I'd say...
Fuck off you scamcoin peddling scumbag.

Hey would you look at that, OP can actually post stuff that is not Tether FUD! 
Good for you :)
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:29:07
Maybe, but its real purpose is your shitty underhanded attempt to plug your scamcoin Bcash in the comments.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:40:47
Correct, but it is not in 2018.
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:56:59


@_date: 2018-11-20 15:22:00
The hyperbolic "crypto collapse" combined with you blatant lie about bitcoin plunging below 4k makes your agenda really obvious. 
Why people who post things like this aren't banned I'll never understand, but at least I can call you out. I'm sure you already know you're an unethical scumbag though, so no need to tell you I guess. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:42:07
That's fucking rich.
A troll pretending to troll the bitcoin forums to "help or rescue" investors is laughable. 
Don't even pretend that you're here trolling because you think seeing people buying bitcoin is "heartbreaking."
@_date: 2018-11-16 22:41:59
Please stop giving this clown the attention he craves...
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:07:11
Been using them for years. No need to register traditional account really, as your "account" is just a string of numbers. No logs, and you can pick servers all across the world on a long list of countries. I also get close to max speed on my 500mbit fiber connection and, of course, they take bitcoin.
Highly recommended.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:37:47
How is this relevant in the bitcoin subreddit?
It's garbage. Your post is garbage, and your project is garbage. Please keep garbage out of this subreddit. There's plenty of bitcoin-related garbage already, we don't need additional spam and shitcoin advertising garbage as well....do you understand?
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:12:58
Another thing, if you pay close attention and check the users posting this garbage, most of these "the end is near / the sky is falling /bitcoin is dead" memes are posted by nocoiners and trolls, so it's not even a fun thing among bitcoiners, it's nocoiner assholes trying to be smug. 
It's pretty annoying to be honest, and I'm pretty disappointed the mods haven't been stricter with the banhammer.
@_date: 2018-11-26 13:43:44
This is r/bitcoin and is about the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. 
Discussion on other "tokens" do not belong here.
@_date: 2018-11-13 21:03:07


Yeah, about that...
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:16:28
lol the amount of ridiculous nocoiners who come out of the woodworks whenever bitcoin is in a bear market is insane...
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:21:06
Are non-english submissions even allowed here?
How would everyone here feel if Jihan Wu started constantly posting articles in Chinese here? Yeah...that's what I thought.
@_date: 2018-11-26 14:12:39


You clearly don't, since you posted this here.


I suppose if you are clueless about it, that would be correct.


Trying to keep this subreddit clear of off-topic discussion, shit- and scamcoin promotion, is not being closed-minded or fanatical. This subreddit would be unusable if people like you had free reign.
Take your bullshit elsewhere, unless you want to discuss bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-21 09:26:30
There is a few of those assholes too, but one would have to be pretty naive to not see that there is a massive astroturfing campaign going on to create a negative sentiment here. 
I'm guessing some of the big banks are behind it, as they have been exposed doing these things before, and stand to lose from the success of bitcoin.
Seen it many times before, but this time it's pretty full on and very blatant. Might be a bit of a panic tbh...
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:26:36
Someone should challenge that legally. It honestly seems  weird if they can just ban mining like that. 
Anyone with some legal experience know how this would hold up if challenged?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:17:23


For each and every post you make, your narcissist personality, and incredibly inflated sense of self importance, becomes more and more evident. Keep it up lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:05:30
Scam site.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:55:53
I have no experience with buying from those sources, so I can't really comment on them, but I'd make sure you check the fees and exchange rate before pulling the trigger, since they do vary a lot in this market.
Oh one more thing...I think Robinhood at this point only allows buying and selling coins, not actually withdrawing them to your own wallet. This means you are essentially just buying a Bitcoin IOU from them. This is expected to change in the future though, but just take this into consideration for now.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:50:12
Imagine a life so sad you have to create a new account just to troll the bitcoin subreddit. Oh wait, you don't have to imagine lol.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:57:38
Ha, original burn there!
I love how you trolls just lose out more and more as time goes by. 
The sheer stupidity required to be in the bitcoin sub trolling, but not actually taking the time to learn what it is, is mind-boggling. 
I bet you'll still be posting asinine tulip memes in 5 years when bitcoin is ubiquitous in modern society and probably worth 10x or more. It's hilarious, but also kinda sad.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:00:49
Usually, calling out people only works when they were wrong no?
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:04:12
This is not the place to peddle your shitcoins...
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:01:02
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:38:47


lmao, seriously? Historical data suggests something VERY different.
Just another salty no-coiner IMO. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:23:26
I have stopped recommending them as well after having a very revealing talk to one of their totally insufferable employees here on reddit a while back. They are not to be trusted at all.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:43:21
He stated he had bought on Bitstamp and Coinbase before, so he is obviously verified. 
I fail to see where, or why, he would encounter any friction when trying to sell. What do you mean? Selling Bitcoin is as easy as buying them if you are already set up on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:38:02


dumbest advice in thread, good job!
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:21:21
You're blatantly shilling for a sub that constantly attacks bitcoin and this sub, and with snide comments about how much more insightful they are over there.   
lol, you didn't expect being called out there buddy?
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:38:41
So, If you could just buy again and stop being an insufferable anti-BTC troll on every thread, that would be great, thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:30:38
There is no way you made $6500 into $300 on bitcoin, even if you bought at the very very top.
So you are either just straight up lying, or you're just not being completely honest and have lost trading shitcoins, not bitcoin.
Another option is that you have been consistently buying high and selling low to achieve such losses...lol
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:07:59
IMO that is pretty damn rude to users in this thread answering your question. Like for example u/apachechief who tried their best to explain it to you, but you just didn't want to listen or were unable to understand.
You got genuine answers, but what you do with them is ultimately up to you.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:29:05
Brian Hoffman went to the dark side a while ago. 
It's still pretty sad seeing people get sucked in by the BCash scammers and chinese mining cartel.
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:19:04
I can't say anything about the quality of the wallet itself, since I stopped using and recommending it a long time ago, but another consideration is this:
The people behind it are BCash numpties and Segwit2x supporters who were ready to throw bitcoin under the bus a short while ago.
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:42:26


I also like to shorten that to just: "Don't trust Ver."
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:31:27
This is the bitcoin sub, and not really suited for discussing pointless shitcoins.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:28:33
One would think you'd understand the "article" you wrote yourself, but apparently not. 
He quit because of personal reasons/mental health, and stil thinks bitcoin is sound money. 
How about some journalistic integrity?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:07:29
Regardless of how you feel about bitcoin, it's literally, per definition, not a ponzi, and you honestly look ignorant for stating that it is.

Funny joke man. 10/10 content and delivery.
@_date: 2018-11-07 23:05:05
So the answer is really just: "Because of some dudes personal opinion and bias."
Wikipedia in a nutshell.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:40:12
Have you tried Bitstamp.net? In my opinion they are the best and most reliable option in Europe.
Also, unless you know from before, I don't think "uncharacteristic" means what you think it does. Just a friendly reminder :)
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:22:48
You should let him know how you feel about his moronic statements:
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:40:23
You present no facts.


That's just objectively and factually wrong, and lets us all know your agenda straight off the bat. There is only one Bitcoin, and the scammy BCash fork did absolutely not "preserve Bitcoin as an electronic p2p cash system". All it did was create a convenient vehicle for your pump and dumps and a way to trick newbies in the bitcoin space to buy a shitcoin thinking it is Bitcoin.  You are in on a scam, let that sink in.
When all you present is lies and propaganda, it's quite easy to dismiss you as a sockpuppet who is in on the BCash scam. 
Your little appeal to the "audience" is cute lmao. Keep trying to scam people with your scamcoin, and I'll keep calling out your bullshit.
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:30:21
Dude, you are embarrassing yourself, and nobody actually believes your lies (except your fellow r/btc scammers ofc).
Bcash is an altcoin created to scam users and you are just a useful idiot for them. 
I agree you should use whatever cryptocurrency you prefer, but saying Bcash is Bitcoin is just asinine.
Go spread your lies and propaganda somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:15:04
I'm not gonna lie, I'm feeling pretty bullish after watching this. 
The funniest bit was the old geezer saying that "we have a real good thing going with the central banks here" and that they "had perfected their art" lmao.
@_date: 2018-11-12 19:52:36
So the ultimate scamcoin is forking, but who cares really? Only the scammers and their victims I guess.
This is the Bitcoin subreddit btw, and not the place to discuss obvious chicom scams.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:30:57
Um, what points about Bitcoin does he have that are good? 
Please be specific.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:43:38
From a purely technical perspective, yes. 
The thing is though, when evaluating the merit of something, we humans usually take into account things like intent, motivation, execution and other factors as well. When you look at how, and why, BCash was created and how it is promoted and maintained, it's obvious that is indeed *very* different from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:44:48
Wow, this is amazing lol. Are you actually being serious? You are telling me I can't contest your obviously false claim, because I can't provide evidence?
OK let me explain something very simple to you. Most humans of earth understand this, except you apparently. When you make a claim, the onus is on YOU to back that claim up. Trying to argue otherwise is really going to make you look ridiculous, and embarrass you even more than you already have.
Honestly man, think about this before you double down again lol
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:47:42


Yeah ok lol. I see that your understanding of this issue is pretty limited. You should probably sell all your coins and report yourself to the authorities if it's so serious.
There is no CP on my full bitcoin node, and no amount of your FUD is going to change that.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:02:54
...aaand he doubles down again. I don't know what to say dude, you're not the brightest one are ya? Are you even reading my posts?
YOU made a claim. YOU have to back up your claim with evidence, not the other way around. This especially goes when the claim is so obviously bullshit. This is not just my opinion, this is how this shit actually works. The fact that you don't understand that, makes me believe you are young and have a lot to learn. 
I'm not trying to be an asshole, but you are in the wrong here, and if you put aside your pride for a second, you might learn something here.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:34:31
I agree with pretty much all of your points, I just don't think we are going to lose this battle. You sound so defeated already :(
UASF showed us, and the attackers, what power we have. Lets not give that power away, and lets use that power again. Lets inform every newbie bitcoiner about DCG &amp; Co. and their malicious plans, and make them stop using their services. Lets fight even harder an smarter!
We can and will win this, and as long as we don't get complacent or think it's already lost, Bitcoin will survive.

@_date: 2018-02-01 13:50:33


Price correction does not equal "dying". Jesus dude, get a grip lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:07:42
Oh shut up about yourself already lol.
Just face it, nobody cares, and nobody likes you. You also have negative karma, which is, sadly, the only indicator of anything on reddit.
I hate blocking people, but fuck man, you are making it hard not to. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:23:01
This sub is currently overrun with trolls, so the "sentiment" might seem completely hopeless, but Bitcoin is still the same amazing tech. 
To be honest, Bitcoin has never been stronger than right now in every metric possible, except price in fiat. Keep that in mind when making decisions.
Oh, and welcome back.

He's an idiot.

If you mean Bitcoin Cash, also called Bcash, it is absolutely not the same as Bitcoin. There is only one Bitcoin, but there are also a bunch of offshoots and copies. Bitcoin Cash, in particular, was mainly created by a chinese mining pool who was trying to steal the name and network effect of the real bitcoin, and is promoted by some incredibly shady scammers. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Bcash. It's just a pump n dump scamcoin at this point, and serves no real purpose other than making certain scammers more money. Just wanted to clear that up, since you seemed to not be aware of the shady history of Bcash.
As for buying bitcoin, you should probably register with one of the more reputable exchanges and get ID verified, then wait for a good buying opportunity, or just dive right in. Right this moment seems like a good time actually. I would recommend Bitstamp.net as a reputable exchange if you are EU based. Maybe try GDAX or gemini if you're in the US. If you are located somewhere not serviced by some of these exchanges, you could always try localbitcoins.com or something. Good luck and [welcome to the fucking show.](
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:09:59
Nobody cares about your shitcoin, sorry.

Another salty x-coiner who panic sold at 6k lmao...
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:11:45
Well, this is the bitcoin sub, and not a shitcoin sub. I'm well aware that there's a lot of money to be made on some of them, but that's not really the issue here. This discussion simply doesn't belong here.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:50:44


What? Where does this misinformation even come from? "Cashing out" is easy and we need to stop this bullshit narrative that it's somehow hard to exchange BTC for fiat. It's really not.
Other than that it was a good post and I wish you and you boss the best of luck with your business.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:32:07
I'm not saying it's fake per se, just that it's not significant in any way and that the priamry function of this "news" is simply to spread FUD. 
You can upload illegal stuff to pretty much any platform or service that exists in some form or another.
Example, If someone uploaded a video of a black background and a really fast stream of binary numbers on the screen, that would actually create some illegal material if properly formatted and compiled, would that video be illegal? Maybe, but would any court rule that you were guilty of consuming illegal content if you viewed it, didn't understand what the garbage was, and then just moved on? I think not. 
I just remember this being a thing we discussed around here like 4 years ago, and the conclusion is that it's pretty much just FUD that some might try to use against bitcoin, but it's just not going to stop bitcoin in any way. 
To be clear, it's not like you actually get this illegal material flashing on your computer screen if you download the blockchain.
Are you actually being serious about this?:


If so, that is some of the most ridiculous FUD I have ever seen around here.

I was actually laughing at it, as I also indicated in my post. Still, It's pretty clear that you're salty though, even though it was funny. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:29:35
Keep thinking you can make me stop calling out you charlatans, scammers and numpties. 
If you guys didn't try to trick newbies into thinking your shitcoin is bitcoin, we wouldn't have a problem at all, but you know your shitcoin would be even more worthless if you didn't hijack the code, the name, the btc subreddit, the bitcoin twitter, etc. etc. 
The truth probably hurts for you guys, but you are on the wrong side of history here, and I'll keep calling out your bullshit every chance I get.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:44:50
You got busted and outed, simple as that. Deal with it. 
This thread is shit and your agenda is shit.
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:59:09
I have "cashed out" an amount in the same range tbh. Not quite as high I must admit, but still in the 6 figure range, and I had no problems. Granted, this was as an individual with a personal account. Would you say the problems you encounter "cashing out" stem from being a business or just in general?
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:02:54
...aaand he doubles down again. I don't know what to say dude, you're not the brightest one are ya? Are you even reading my posts?
YOU made a claim. YOU have to back up your claim with evidence, not the other way around. This especially goes when the claim is so obviously bullshit. This is not just my opinion, this is how this shit actually works. The fact that you don't understand that, makes me believe you are young and have a lot to learn. 
I'm not trying to be an asshole, but you are in the wrong here, and if you put aside your pride for a second, you might learn something here.
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:55:31
I'm prejudice? nope lol. I support all humans rights, and especially support LGBT rights, since historically they have had limited rights in society.  From looking at your post history you seem prejudice against trans, while being trans, so that's a little awkward. I can't figure out this world anymore lol. 
Anyways, you are pointing fingers and calling prejudice, meanwhile, here's a nice quote from you, who is of course, totally not prejudice:


Oh, and stop denying climate change, makes you look ignorant. Have a good day.

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:10:51
...and your track record continues. It has been rallying ever since you posted this lol.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:04:33


That's pretty ironic coming from you, a bitcoin hater and troll, spending all his time on reddit on a sub for a tech he actually dislikes...
Maybe you should look at how you spend your own time, before criticizing others lol.

Like Krugman you mean? lmao.
This is just another dinosaur, looking up at the meteor charging at them at blazing speed, and cursing at it. 
I can guarantee you that Shiller would not be able to explain to you or anyone how bitcoin works. His opinion is completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:53:35
A bit off-topic, but you should look into using Reddit Enhancement Suite (RES). It enhances the functionality of reddit and makes it a lot better. You can tag users and assign colors and text tags.
I tag all the detractors, haters and trolls, and use different color tags for each type of numpty that we find around here. 
It really makes it very easy to spot the threads being brigaded and it lets me know, or I should say predict, what their motives and agendas are very easily and quickly.
Of course I also tag well informed or "important" posters, so that I can easily spot CTOs of companies, Core devs, CS reps, etc.
I've found this to be a tremendous help in navigating this subreddit and extracting useful info. 
If you already use it, I don't mean to lecture, and maybe someone else reading this finds it useful :)
BTW, I've had tagged for a while...and it sure isn't a positive one...
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:40:07

@_date: 2018-11-26 15:05:06
It's not censoring, it's the rules of this subreddit. 
It's not really that complicated lol
@_date: 2018-03-23 13:05:33
lmao, looking at these dudes, I'm not surprised they fell for the BCash scam. This is pretty cringe, not gonna lie haha.
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:00:12


That really depends on your timescale. If you zoom out, it would be more accurate to say that it's constantly rising actually.


What? There is plenty of good news coming out. Far more than negative news, unless of course you count old farts from the establishment yelling at a technology they don't understand, as bad news


Profiting from bitcoin newbies like you panic selling when it's low.


Yes, most people who understand what bitcoin is and what it's primary value proposition is, knows it's pretty much inevitable that it will reach 20k again and even surpass it. When investing, think in years, not weeks or months.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:33:31
What is that even supposed to mean? Is there an argument you'd like to present? 
You do realize that what you call "1 mb crippled chain" is what is known as Bitcoin right? If some people create and run an implementation that diverges from the consensus, like btc1, it becomes an altcoin, per definition. This is pretty basic stuff.

The most important question IMO: Are they Bitcoiners, or Barrycoiners?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:21:06
As I suspected, you faceplanted hard when confronted with proper arguments and embarrassed yourself further. 
So gold is just a bad investment then, not a ponzi according to you?

What we need can be implemented in the bitcoin protocol, or buildt on top of it.

@_date: 2018-02-27 14:19:57
Read the rules and don't break them and you'll be fine. People don't get banned without a reason around here, that's a lie spread by Ver and his numpty-bots.

Are you saying ethereum and Vitalik are above any criticism, is perfect, or that just because they are Core they can't criticize anyone? Since your post is removed it's honestly hard to understand what you're complaining about.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:49:17
We are on the bitcoin subreddit. Everyone here(that isn't a one day old troll account at least) knows that a blockchain needs a value token to operate. The whole "blockchain good, bitcoin bad" fallacy has been debunked and argued a million times over. Don't you understand that these brand new troll accounts are just wasting our time?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:47:19
Case in point lol.
Hey dumbass. Have a look at a bitcoin price chart, all data, on a log scale, and tell me what you see?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:02:40
This is the definition of a ponzi scheme:


So you are objectively, technically, and literally WRONG, no matter how you try to sound like you know what you're talking about. There is no operator in bitcoin, and nobody is paying old investors with the revenue of new investors. It's just an asset where price is determined on the open market by supply and demand. This is some seriously basic stuff dude.
A ponzi is a very specific thing, and words have different meanings for a reason. You don't get to redefine words just to suit your retarded narrative, and you look ridiculous and desperate in trying to do so.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:41:29
If this becomes a thing that all pools do, or even just a large enough subset of them, and it becomes widely known that anything under 5 sat/byte is likely to not be mined, everyone will start using 5 sat/byte or more for every transaction.
That's why not picking up the low fee transactions, which is essentially free money, can actually be interpreted as greed, because it will degrade the user experience of Bitcoin to make them more money in the long run. 
I though this was glaringly obvious as it has been discussed many times in this sub. I'm sorry if my post came off as a bit snarky though.
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:52:55
You are a dishonest scumbag. Simple as that. Trying to deter investors from investing in BTC, and pushing garbage like Monero and Siacoin.
Calling it a pyramid scheme just cemented the obvious fact that you have no clue what you are talking about.
Please, if you have zero clue, don't try to give financial advice on the internet. Especially if it's as misinformed and ignorant as this.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:30:31
It boggles my mind how you ignorant haters have absolutely no idea what you're talking about, yet you have such strong convictions and opinions anyways.  
lmao, did you just gamble on it being hard to buy cars with bitcoin or what?
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:45:01
Nobody cares about your scammy Bcash and sociopath Roger Vers lies. 
It probably gets removed here because it's off-topic alt-coin garbage propaganda from a scammmer. Kinda like we also don't like BitConnect around here.
@_date: 2018-11-16 19:22:50
Or, they could just be making really really dumb decisions...
I mean, they have been earlier when it comes to garbage coins like Bcash, so it's not a stretch to think that this is just stupidity and some kind of warped pride fucking them over now.
In either case, I love seeing the morons who deal with Bcash get burnt. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:19:33


Just because you missed some profits, doesn't mean you were wrong about it being a scam you know. ETH was, and is, a massive premine scam.

This guy is completely full of shit. Same old lies about "bitcoin splitting in two" and the the guy called Roger Ver "level headed" hahahahaha. 100% pure garbage.
Roger Ver really has some serious skills at scamming and bamboozling people, I'll give him that.
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:13:52

I guess I'm just waiting for Ver and his cohorts to pump it a bit again :P
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:26:12


That's some premium FUD you're peddling there. 
FWIW, you're completely full of shit, and the amount of mental gymnastics required to come to the false conclusion that running a full bitcoin node = distributing CP, is just staggering. You're either maliciously spreading FUD, or you're a complete moron. Neither option is very flattering for you. Get a fucking grip.
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:45:20
Don't play daft.

@_date: 2018-11-21 09:39:05
No I didn't miss that. That's why i included "these positive effects are not dependent on the drugs coming from your doctor either."
Of course, in a perfect world, all doctors would be up to date, knowledgeable and honest, and it would be no problem to leave it to the medical system. But the fact is that the entire medical system is severely lagging behind, and don't use these "drugs" to their full potential, or even at all.
I don't in fact blame some people medicating themselves when the medical system fails them and the only medication able to help them is illegal and kept from them. I guess I'm just more into personal freedom than you, and have more faith in the younger generation than you. That's ok though, have a good one...
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:29:23
If I understand your comment correct, it's the dumbest thing I have read all day. Congrats.
@_date: 2018-02-16 19:49:00
Nah dude, you don't hold any crypto positions because you don't understand it at all, and that's fair enough. What isn't though, and is frankly quite embarrassing for you, is that you are talking shit about something you have no real understanding of. 
Keep talking shit though, we'll see who is right eventually...
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:18:42
If you want to be an idiot, sure.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:05:40
I don't think you understand my point.
I don't care if it costs you, as you are, in fact, promoting the scam by posting about it on reddit and youtube. I do however care about all the other innocent, gullible people who are losing money on the BCash scam you are promoting. You can't just absolve yourself from responsibility when you actually promote it. Regardless of what you say, promoting it is what you do when you post about it on youtube and reddit.
You're going to find yourself on the wrong side of history here, and later you will look back on your Bcash days and cringe hard. The crypto space is already full of scammers and charlatans, we don't need more of them, even if they come neatly packaged with canned laughter.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:23:23
lol, are you one of those uninformed people who thinks blockchain is so amazing, but bitcoin is useless?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:39:06

@_date: 2018-03-02 22:55:30
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:40:28
Honestly, do you expect anyone to believe that was a mistake?
You simply copped too much static from the bitcoin community, and pussied out. You have already showed your true colors as an enemy of bitcoin. I used to respect you and listen to what you had to say, but fuck man, your ethics have gone to shit and all you do is rub shoulders with scammers and charlatans while peddling shitcoins these days.
What a fall from grace...  
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:41:51
It really seems like an organized effort from all angles.
While all this is going on, the banks are really trying to limit the flow of cash to the exchanges as well. More and more stories of cancelled and blocked deposits are emerging, while media is going crazy with FUD and people dumping. Someone wants either cheap coins, or they are trying to kill bitcoin completely, which obviously won't work. 
Either way, we have clearly entered the "then they fight you" phase.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:54:21
Oh damn, it's a troll post haha. I guess you got fed this time ;)
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:02:05
So salty because you missed out. What is more embarrassing than just being wrong, is the fact that you're doubling down now to convince yourself that you made the right choice avoiding "the scam". You're a joke dude.
Forex is not scam, and neither is Bitcoin. That's just an objective and undeniable fact, and no amount of your ridiculous salt is going to change the definition of words to fit your misguided opinion.
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:37:08
It's kinda funny to see how so many of the S2X supporters in that thread, are now busy pushing the scammy "BCash is Bitcoin" narrative. 
Idiots will be idiots I guess.

They let you read half the article then pester you to sign up. Fuck them.

What is this Spidren site? 
It's being spammed so much lately, and the content is usually subpar.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:46:04
Did you enter your position based on a meme as well?
Think about why you actually invested, and then consider if those reasons are still there. Have the fundamentals changed? 
Surely you didn't invest only because of memes and the desire to be rich?
Anyways, if you are not comfortable trying to time the bottom, I'd say hold, but nobody can really answer these questions for you.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:15:21
That's because you hang out over at the intellectual vacuum that is r/btc. I would advice against that if you actually want to learn anything of value in this space.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:29:18
Shitcoin peddlers everywhere...
@_date: 2018-02-25 17:33:56
It doesn't have to be, but since Bitcoin is by far the most decentralized and secure blockchain, There is no reason for most other value tokens to even exist, other than to line the pockets of scammers like Ver and other shitcoin peddlers...*You* know this right?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:57:13
If your bank don't play well with a crypto service, I suggest changing banks. It's the only way they will learn.
@_date: 2018-03-07 15:22:34
lol at you confusing one guy with an entire sub of 700k+ people...
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:15:10
Because you know the motivations and history of all 700k people in this sub...right lol.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:26:52
You are totally ignoring history though. We have seen worse drops, percentage wise, than this and bitcoin always bounces back at some point. Bitcoin is going through very clear and distinct boom/bust cycles, and when looking at the fundamentals, there are absolutely no reason it shouldn't bounce back this time as well. Sentiment will change and so will the market. "When" is the only real question.
I know it can be scary to see these drops, but it is nothing new. My best advice to you, would be to take a break from watching the price for a while.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:14:32
What are you talking about?

You were no more correct than me in any of my statements, and your obsession with stating how correct you think you were is just proving my point about your personality.

The divide in the community is greatly exaggerated. Bitcoin will continue to be Bitcoin, regardless of how many altcoins are created. Sure, it might cause some uncertainty in the market, but there will never be uncertainty around what coin is Bitcoin, that's just silly.

Should always just report bitcoin dot com links as "bad link" or "scam". 
This instantly removes it from view, and since it never comes back from the mod queue, I guess the mods agree that it's a "bad link". Rightfully so, as it's probably one of the most malicious sites in the bitcoin space.

This is a great example of a BCash shill pretending to be "woke", while trying to scam newbie bitcoiners with their shitcoin. It's just lies and propaganda, like always. So cringe.
Look dude, you can fork all you want, just don't pretend your shitcoin is bitcoin. Bitcoin (BTC) is bitcoin, and will always be bitcoin. Your delusions don't change reality.
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:19:22
Maybe they just want those high value customers to come directly to them instead of going through your company? If so, that does makes your original post/complaint more valid and is a serious concern if we want healthy competition in the exchange space.
Maybe they just don't want brokers or other exchanges using their infrastructure or something. It does sound like you act as an exchange, but use their exchange as the actual backbone behind the curtains.
Either way, thanks for clarifying and I hope you get your limits sorted and keep fighting.

@_date: 2017-09-07 20:19:58
I'm trying to understand what you mean, but you aren't making much sense to be honest.


Why would it be? It's a question about an altcoin. I think much of your confusion comes from thinking bcash is some equal brother of bitcoin who came into reality when the bitcoin community was split. This is nonsense of course, as it's just another altcoin, similar to many before it. It's mostly irrelevant.


I don't understand what you are arguing. It seems like a strawman from where I am standing. I have no problem with altcoins, I'm just very clear about what bcash is: A garbage altcoin that serves no purpose other than enrich certain scammers at the expense of noobs.
What exactly do you mean by saying I'm trying to deny that the free market exists? Please reply with something of substance that is not a strawman.

@_date: 2017-09-27 15:51:45
Yes, a piss weak cop-out, but I guess we don't have to point that out, since you already know this. I simply can't recommend your product if you don't even know if you are going to continue supporting Bitcoin or not. 
If you aren't going to take a clear stance against this calculated attack, then it's painfully obvious that your interests are purely profit driven, and that you care very little about the spirit and purpose behind Bitcoin, and it's users. It's a real shame.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:26:48
THIS is how you side with your users and take a firm stand on the right side of Bitcoin history. Take notes u/chalash.
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:30:04
Hate it all you want, but it really just isn't up for discussion. 
Think of it the same way that it's not up for discussion whether or not the earth is flat. Obviously this doesn't stop certain people from claiming the earth is flat, but everyone worth their salt knows that is ridiculous. Similarly, some people still claim bitcoin is a scam/fraud, even though the properties of bitcoin categorically prevents it from being a scam/fraud.
Bitcoin might be a lot of things, but a scam or fraud it is not. 
I guess some people get it mixed up, because unfortunately there is a lot of fraud and scams in the crypto space, but that still doesn't make bitcoin itself a scam/fraud.
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:58:47
You haven't lost anything until you sell.
Here's just a short story: Back in 2013 my dad bought bitcoin at the VERY top of the first april bubble. I think his entry price was around 243 dollars. This was of course after hearing me going on and on about bitcoin for a while. It immediatley crashed to 50 usd, and my dad felt really stupid. I told him to just hold on to the btc and not worry about the short term price. He listened, and these days my dad is the proud owner of 9 BTC, worth a hell of a lot more than he purchased them for.
Moral is: Don't sell at a loss. If you do, you are **guaranteed** a loss. Chances of bitcoin bouncing back are huge imo. Just relax a bit and look at it long term. Good luck :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:18:05

No worries. It's just that there has honestly been at least 15-20 of these posts in the last 24 hours, so it's just a little overused. Good chance to pick up more BTC though, you're right about that. :)
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:37:52
How and what exactly is time going to tell? 
Time is not going to change it from a scam to something legit, and if for some reason BCash lives on or gains more traction, it just means there are more people who fell for the scam, it doesn't make it less of a scam.
How do you feel about the many people who have lost money in the scam you are promoting? That's ok as long as you benefit?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:20:59

@_date: 2017-09-21 21:04:19
I know what you are saying, and this isn't necessarily for you, but just want to reiterate this for potential newbies reading:
There is only one Bitcoin. The others are altcoins. Bcash and SW2X will both be altcoins, even if 99% of miners start mining SW2X. It's very important to drive this home so people understand. 
SW2X is changing consensus rules, so it doesn't matter at all if they are longest chain, since it's not going to be the longest ***valid*** chain. It is, per definition, going to be an altcoin since it doesn't follow the Bitcoin consensus rules.
Bitcoin will continue to be Bitcoin. Bitcoin can be found here:
Don't be fooled. Hodl Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:03:13
And you tried to draw attention to a scammer and his scammy propaganda. I'm sorry we are not making that easy for you. I have you RES tagged since you have been doing this same bullshit, and concern trolling for a while. Just stop trying to make it sound like Ver has anything that deserves a refutation. Everything that man says he does so to line his own pockets or drive his agenda. He is a textbook sociopath scammer and you should stop trying to ram his garbage down our throats.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:52:38
If you think that was a mistake, I honestly don't think you have been keeping up with the whole BCash drama. 
That was 100% intentional, and they only changed it when the backlash outweighed the pile of cash they got from scammer Ver.

Sigh, since you are obviously a bit slow, I'll just paste my previous reply here. Maybe you can learn a thing or two.
This is the definition of a ponzi scheme:


So you are objectively, technically, and literally WRONG, no matter how you try to sound like you know what you're talking about. There is no operator in bitcoin, and nobody is paying old investors with the revenue of new investors. It's just an asset where price is determined on the open market by supply and demand. This is some seriously basic stuff dude.
A ponzi is a very specific thing, and words have different meanings for a reason. You don't get to redefine words just to suit your retarded narrative, and you look ridiculous and desperate in trying to do so.

It's been a day or two since you emailed correct? Most bitcoin companies are experiencing a lot of growth and customer support is suffering across the board. I would wait a little longer than that before posting scam accusations.

I honestly don't think they have any legal obligation to do anything about bcash. It's not Bitcoin, and bad actors can fork bitcoin into several altcoins continuously, creating a situation where they can effectively bury these funds in engineering work if they wanted.

You should probably understand that being an expert on one thing, doesn't make you an expert on all things. Bitcoin is not something you can compare to other currencies and assets. The fact that traditional finance heads are still trying to fit bitcoin into their understanding of economics is in many ways really hilarious.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:44:48
But they are very clear about their plan to diverge and become a different coin, that's just a fact. That's why it's a good move to cut out the tumor ahead of time.

So which one is it? Are you a non technical user who don't care about these things, or are you just pretending to be a "bona fide Bitcoin user", who "don't actually care about hard forks or 8MB weight"?
Handing the project over to a handful of corporations controlling a few major miners, and one corrupt dev, is pretty much the very definition of centralization.
Seeing that you have no technical arguments and is opening your posts with the very classy "Fuck You", I don't think we have much more to discuss.
Enjoy your altcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:39:45
Fair policy? Are you serious?
The people you mention have all come out and supported a corporate attack on Bitcoin, and deserve all the criticism they get. 
The "way this community behaves" is a result of being passionate about a decentralized Bitcoin, that can potentially liberate humans from the central bankers stranglehold, and solve so many of the worlds problems. Do you really think anyone is going to pull punches here when this is being threatened by assholes trying to undermine the whole movement?
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:17:16
He's not really joking, although it's easy to think so, given the ridiculousness of these claims. 
It's Roger Ver, or so no surprise that the information is false.
He is a known scammer and charlatan. I wouldn't trust a single word coming out of his mouth (see Mt.Gox vid as an example), or a single thing written in his PP presentation.
He is all about lying, deceiving and lining his own pocket. Ex-politican to boot. Pretty much as scummy as they get.
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:08:00
But that has failed, clearly. There will never be consensus for SW2X. So going ahead will make an altcoin. It's quite simple really.

I don't think it justifies their extremely hostile stance towards anything Bitcoin.
Recommending to put a few percent of your portfolio into Bitcoin is not something that should warrant a ban.
It's not hard to see that they have an irrational hate towards Bitcoin, let's be real here.

Don't sell yourself short mate, you just figured it out. Even if 99% of all bitcoins are destroyed or sent to a null address over time, the remaining bitcoin economy would just operate on the remaining bitcoin, and as you said, be trading or using a smaller decimal point.

See the thing a lot of people have a hard time grasping, including you apparently, is that it doesn't matter how they "describe it", or what they "want". The **fact** remains that any implementation that deviates from the consensus rules of Bitcoin, is per definition, an altcoin. Longest chain is irrelevant as long as it's not the longest **valid** chain.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:38:52
Everything was dumb about it. First off BCH is not Bitcoin, and has really nothing to do with Bitcoin. If anything BCH proved that Bitcoin is resilient, since it was made to disrupt Bitcoin, but failed miserably.
It would be equally dumb to say that the creation of the Euro proved that you can inflate the dollar at the push of a button. You are either trolling or have absolutely no understanding of the topic at hand.
And when it comes to mining, they aren't being printed for no reason. It's part of the POW security model. Do you even understand Bitcoin?
EDIT: OH lord, just quickly checked your post history, and you are just a complete hater/troll and not worthy of my time. Goodbye.

So we should just lay down and give up, that's the plan?
@_date: 2018-11-27 17:10:49
I honestly think this is well known around here. Shitcoins and ICOs have been doing this for 5+ years, and the many unprofessional crypto blogs posing as news and review sites, makes this easy for them.
The easiest solution to this is just focusing on the only crypto that really matters, Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:45:47
This wouldn't be an issue if btc1 wasn't diverging from the bitcoin network would it? 
btc1 is an altcoin, do yourself a favor and realize this.
Backporting this Core 0.15 change to earlier versions is being considered. We should just cut the btc1 tumor out right away, since their malicious intentions are clear.


0.15 side of the network? You mean Bitcoin? Jeffcoin is not going to be Bitcoin, no matter how serious your delusion is.
There will be plenty of hashpower to mine Bitcoin, even after Jeffcoin splits off. I'm not too concerned about that. I'm more concerned with the lack of replay protection in btc1, and the extremely hostile and disingenuous attempts to label Jeffcoin as Bitcoin by bad actors like you.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:15:46
Those numbers are pulled out of your ass, and you know it.
@_date: 2017-09-11 18:31:56
Why would we want a bridge to btc1 at all really? Like I said, I don't care about altcoins. Your entire argument relies on the fact that btc1 is in any shape or form Bitcoin. It's not. It's an implementation that diverges from the consensus rules and is therefore an altcoin.
There is no "other half" of the network. What you are talking about is another coin with different consensus rules., i.e. not Bitcoin.
I suspect you understand this, but you're just unwilling to concede that the problems you are describing are not problems caused by upgrades in 0.15, but instead problems caused by the malicious attack that is JeffCoin without any replay protection.

Way to rally the troops there champ...
Personally, I say fuck that. I'm going to fight it, and I'm willing to put my life on the line. Bitcoin has changed my life for the better, and there's no way I'm gonna back down while some corporate scumbags try to hijack this beautiful project.


They have a fair chunk of the hashing power, sure, but far from all. 
When it comes to the vast bulk of the non-technical users, I think the majority would be behind Bitcoin, not SW2X, if boths sides arguments were presented fairly to them. So let's continue doing that. Don't give up.
@_date: 2017-09-27 13:08:33
lol you guys are so delusional....or you simply misspelled UASF.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:45:49
Sure, anything to help you sleep at night and line your pockets right? 
The fact that you underhandedly post a video named "Bitcoin Cash stand up comedy" under the title "Short stand-up about Bitcoin" on reddit, says everything we need to know about your intentions.
Look, the the bottom line here is this: You are promoting a centralized chinese scam coin, created to trick newbies into buying it thinking it's the real bitcoin. They use sites like bitcoin dot com, twitter handles like  and subreddits like rbtc to achieve this. Dolts like you might not be the main culprits, but you are certainly helping and promoting this scam, and no amount of mental gymnastics and excuses will change that.
I sincerely hope you are new to this space, and that you are just gullible and easily fooled, because the alternative paints a much darker picture for you.
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:46:51
I recently contacted them and closed my company's account with them. Felt good. Might just hodl any BTC transactions instead of converting to fiat for a while to see how that pans out. Will keep an eye open for alternatives meanwhile.
I recommend everyone to write to them and let them know how you feel and cancel your account there if you have one.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:31:19
Thanks for confirming that you don't understand how this works.
Honestly, as a non technical user, you should probably be thankful that someone does understand, and that some people are actually trying to save our precious and decentralized Bitcoin. One day you might too, if you take the time to learn how this works.
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:02:43

@_date: 2017-09-21 15:44:01
Maybe you should understand how the tech works before getting into discussions about it. That statement just reeks of technical ineptitude. If they change consensus, it's not the same coin.

The fact that Bitcoin doesn't have the highest rating of all cryptos, basically invalidates these ratings completely.

Nobody cares about btc1...
You do realize this won't create a split until the incompatible rules of btc1 kicks in? So you are literally just upset that we are protecting ourselves from your attack?
Here is a quote from the OP, just to make it clear for everyone what a piece of shit he is:


Are you actually asking for Core to help and facilitate your attack on Bitcoin? lol, that's something else. Hey OP, fuck you.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:26:32

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:15:01
While you did make a smart trade, thinking we have seen "the top" for bitcoin forever is extremely short sighted.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:56:00
But you see, regardless of what it reminds you of, it quite literally, per definition, isn't a ponzi scheme. 
Words have different meanings for a reason you know.
As for using credit cards and second mortgages to buy Bitcoin, I'd say that would be a bad choice, but it's not really a problem with Bitcoin, more of a problem with the individuals making that choice, wouldn't you say?

Full disclosure, in case you were interested: I took profits at 17k, 14k and some more at 9k. Sitting on around 50/50 crypto/USD at the moment, and renovating the house from a small part of the gains, so I am pretty happy with my plays no matter what happens. You seem upset however, you ok?

The Oslo Bitcoin Meet-up in Norway has unfortunately also been "compromised". It's under the control and leadership of an extremely misinformed individual, to put it mildly. 
He keeps promoting 2X and talks of bcash as being a real alternative (would be funny if it wasn't so sad), and has now also invited Fake Satoshi to speak. 
I have since learned that a many people have stopped going or decided against going for the first time because of this, or him, so it's a bit sad tbh.

You are lying. It's about protecting Bitcoin against malicious takeover attempts like JeffCoin, and it absolutely is about one side being right and one wrong. Explain to me how this change in any way can hurt Bitcoin? Keep in mind that I care not for the health of the btc1/JeffCoin network nodes, and don't consider them Bitcoin.
I understand what the expression means, I just don't agree that the Core 0.15 change damages Bitcoin in any way (i.e. cutting off our nose). We are cutting off a nasty tumor, leaving behind a cleaner and better face actually.

Yes, it was a good point, and yes, Segwit always had consensus in the community. It was just Jihan Wu and his Chinese mining cartel that didn't want the upgrade because it would kill their extra profits from abusing ASICBOOST.
Since we can't let miners decide what Bitcoin is, we got Segwit activated through UASF.

Well, good thing Bitcoin doesn't care if you find it inspiring or not.
When ready and widely deployed, LN will let you use Bitcoin with minimal fees for trivial purchases again. This has been known and discussed in the bitcoin community for years.
Bitcoin is not so expensive that only large companies can use it, why do you say this? And why would you pay $100 for a transaction?

It's pure fantasy to even think that 99% of the world decides that S2X is Bitcoin. That's some r/btc level delusion.
But yes, the reality remains: If anyone is still keeping the Bitcoin chain alive, it will still be Bitcoin. You can't change the rules and take the name of an existing coin...honestly, this is some basic stuff.
Anyways, I got the info I wanted and it seems you guys have revealed your hand.
**The conclusion: There is a good chance Bread will label S2X altcoin as Bitcoin in their app.**

Holy crap, that's the biggest pile of wanna-be pseudo-intellectual garbage I have read in a while. Straight from the r/btc playbook lol.
So, It's a huge deal if people start running btc1 software, because it signals the end of bitcoin as we know it. Right now only 2% of nodes run btc1 software, and this is mainly because Core has a lot of trust in the (real) bitcoin community, and most bitcoiners know SW2X is a pointless and unwanted upgrade, and especially since it comes in the form of a contentious hardfork. If for some reason, the majority switch to btc1 software, it means that a small handful of CEOs determine the future of bitcoin, and we obviously don't want that. That's the main point for many of us, protecting Core from being replaced by corporations.
It's also technically a very bad idea to increase the potential max blocksize from 4mb to 8mb at this point, but I probably don't have to get into that since it's been discussed to death.
So yeah, it is in fact a huge deal if the majority of users start to run btc1 software. I'm not even sure why I would have to explain this, since it's incredibly obvious, but ok.

Ironic, coming from you.
Listen, if you download an app to use it for Bitcoin, but for some ridiculous reason, the app stops supporting Bitcoin, and you have to withdraw them...it's more than fair to leave a bad review. 
In this case the app does not do what was advertised. It was advertised as a bitcoin wallet, and sometime mid November it will start being some altcoin wallet. That's completely unacceptable in my opinion, and I implore everyone to let them know how you feel about it. Facebook, twitter, google reviews, etc.
That being said, if you for some reason applaud Xapo for the way they are handling this situation, give them a good review.

Well, regardless of your attitude towards it, words and names matter, and Bitcoin is called Bitcoin, not SegWit1X.
Calling Bitcoin by that name, instead of it's proper name, Bitcoin, is actually an extremely politicized action, so your statement makes no sense and only serves to unveil your dishonesty further.

True, but that was before he went total retard. These days he is probably the worst thing to happen to bitcoin in years. He is particularly dangerous, because of the unfortunate combination of a very strong conviction about tech he doesn't fully understand, combined with a fat wallet. He won't be able to destroy Bitcoin, but the bastard sure is trying hard.

I understand perfectly and support this move from Core.
btc1 is very clear and open about it's intentions to diverge from the bitcoin network, to become a different coin, so I don't see why Core should give them any consideration at all.
To quote a few devs on github, first one from jtomin:


because you plan to diverge. We can start preparing today.
If we set a date, what if you guys decide to change the date later? We
cannot waste time trying to accommodate all the details of an
underspecified, rushed ans underreviewed (because some review was rejected
or ignored) implementation.

This depends on what software/wallet you use to generate the transaction. Some wallets give you the option to specify a custom fee, while others use a "low/normal/high priority" setting. Some wallets actually just decide the fee for you, but this is becoming less common.

It's always an interesting time to be involved in Bitcoin. November will be extra interesting because it will reveal the hands of a lot of players in this space. Including Breadwallet/Bread App. 
I'm trying to find out if you are indeed just trying to be cautious, or if you're fully in on the attack and deserves a spot on the boycott/shitlist.
So far you seem (from the answer I finally got form the other thread) open to the idea of labeling S2X as Bitcoin, so you're firmly planted in the boycott/shitlist category. Thanks

If you believe there will be no hashpower mining Bitcoin after the attack, I have a bridge to sell you lol. 
If anything, Bcash showed us that promises and agreements go out the window when there's profit on the table, and the futures markets are telling us quite clearly that Bitcoin will be vastly more valuable than the new shitcoin.
Bitcoin will be fine and morons betting on shitcoins and forked altcoins will get wrecked. Business as usual.

Because it is not, and never will be Bitcoin. And the purpose of the B2X attack is to become the real Bitcoin and subsequently replace the Bitcoin Core development team, so that's why it most likely won't last long. Even Bitcoin Judas said he would drop support of B2X if it didn't magically become Bitcoin, but then again I wouldn't trust his word for anything.
Do you actually think the miners dumping Bitcoin will overpower the effect of the massive dump of B2X the millions of users will unleash?

It makes more sense if you look at it as the actual attack that it is. The intention is not to "upgrade" bitcoin, but to seize control over the repo and the codebase. We must fight and defeat this attack for Bitcoin to stay decentralized and prosper.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:14:31
No, of course not. The Bitcoin community is calling it Bcash because Bitcoin is obviously taken. The retards behind Bcash, who are trying to call it Bitcoin Cash, simply to piggyback or steal Bitcoins network effect will of course argue differently. They don't even realize that it's like making a brand of jeans called Leevi's and using an almost identical logo.

I don't need your advice. There is nothing you can teach me. I have been in this space for 6+ years, and taken multiple 6 figure profits, and I also expected this crash/correction, and took some profits at 17k and 14k. 
I never said anything about price in my post, just pointed out how shitty some human beings are during these crashes. 
I have been through a lot of them, and there are a few things we can always count on: People like you being smug know-it-alls, and the price eventually rebounding.

No, Coinbase will not decide the "victor": Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin after the fork, the only thing Coinbase gets to decide is if it will be a Bitcoin company or not after the fork.
Just get your coins on a wallet where you control the private keys, and then wait with any transactions until after the fork. After the fork and the dust settles, there will be plenty of guides for you to follow on how to split your coins and avoid a replay attack on the other chain. This is only if you are interested in the S2X shitcoin of course, but I suspect most of us will be, since it's basically a free air-drop of coins that can be converted into real BTC or fiat.
Edit: A hardware wallet like Ledger Nano S or Trezor will most likely update their software to deal with this fork very smoothly. I would recommend a hardware wallet above all else. Top notch security, ease of use and you control the keys. It's win-win.

It's very clear that you don't understand, but I'll try to explain it to you.
Nobody knows what price is the bottom, but everyone who has been paying attention, knows that it will bounce back. This is why HODL is a safe strategy.

Why do you try to disguise the same tripe big blocker rhetoric behind this pointless fake light-hearted role-play?
The answer is still the same: The benefit of bigger blocks is currently not outweighing the danger of centralization. Layer 2 technologies will solve the fee problem in time, and if it doesn't then it will be expensive to transact with Bitcoin. So be it.

@_date: 2017-09-07 18:08:46
Of course it matters that it's Bitcoin. What kind of question is that?
From the grayscale site:


The BIT enables investors to gain exposure to the price movement of bitcoin through a traditional investment vehicle, without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoins."
So when you invest in GBTC you agree that its the exposure to Bitcoin that matters, nothing else. It doesn't say anything about how every little chinese clone of bitcoin that bad actors decide to make, should have any relevancy to GBTC. You may wish that was the case, but you wishing it was so, doesn't make it so.
If they do end up crediting the value of BCH to the investors of GBTC somehow, investors should consider themselves lucky and see it as a bonus.
If you want the chance of cashing in on every possible fork that happens, you need to hold the actual private key. This is basic bitcoin knowledge...I hope.
In this case the propped up market value of Bcash is not really relevant to the question at hand.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:25:48
Yeah, I think the fork is going to go ahead, mainly because I don't think the motivations of the attackers are to "upgrade" the protocol but rather cause as much disruption as possible. It looks like it will cause a lot of confusion and maybe even loss of funds for non-technical users.
Still, Bitcoin will obviously be Bitcoin after the fork, there is no chance of B2X becoming Bitcoin, like some delusional people think. The only question that remains is how much damage this attack will do to the momentum we currently have. Personally I think we'll be fine, and Coinbase and the rest of the suits will be forced to come crawling back to the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:46:01
Way to expose your technical ineptitude. B2X is a change in consensus and total work is only relevant if it's actually valid. 
Hint: B2X work won't be valid and the Bitcoin network reject it as garbage, as it should.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:51:19
I never said it would, but if you want to battle that strawman, go ahead I won't stop you lol.  
Anyways. Pretty much the entire Bitcoin technical community is in agreement that the blocks will have to be increased at some point. But right now, is not the time. We need to see the effects of Segwit over time, and how LN works with current blocksize before even thinking about increasing it. Why? Because the security and decentralization of the network is the number one priority.
Even if there was total agreement that the best solution right now would be to increase the blocksize to 2MB (which is very far from truth, there's very little support from users to be honest), most of the Bitcoin community would still be against the Segwit2X movement simply because of how it tries to circumvent the tried and tested FOSS process and try to replace the Bitcoin Core team.
I'm curious, do you think you know something that the rest of us don't know, or do you think you understand scaling better than the Bitcoin Core devs or something?

I repsectfully disagree. They have an irrational hate towards Bitcoin, both on r/investing and r/personalfinance. All you have to do is mention or suggest Bitcoin to get banned.
While what you say about their preference being low risk investments is correct, it's pretty clear that they lash out at anyone who mentions Bitcoin.

If you are within the eurozone and can do SEPA, I can recommend "sturle"/"sturles". He is one of the old-school OTC traders of bitcoin, operates out of Norway, and has a flawless record. I have done quite a few trades with him and have nothing but good things to say.

I'm not for money laundering per se, but the way I see it, if there is suspicion of a crime, there is a normal process that should be followed. You know, a normal investigation, charges and conviction, if guilty of course. 
I don't support for a second that any government has the right to freely and unhindered look into your finances or holdings in any way shape or form, unless there is evidence of a crime being committed and you are under investigation. Every man and woman on earth has the right to financial privacy by default. So in that sense I think AML/KYC etc. is a total overreach and abuse of power. 
Why do you ask?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:22:43
You could be yeah, but you'd be very misinformed and ignorant.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:27:55
Couldn't they just take a hardline stand against S2X, and then follow up by tethering their app to a Bitcon Core node in the background and that would be it? 
I know you can do that as a user, so couldn't they just do that as default, like as a company policy? This way their app would follow the Bitcoin chain, no matter what the chinese miners do.

Posting a title with "Croatia will ban bitcoin.." without any actual proof and the post being pure speculation, is pretty "fucked up" around here to be fair.

You are so full of shit it's unbelievable. While I accept your micromanagement excuse, as it does sound plausible, why are you rubbing shoulders with unethical scammers like Ver at all? What is your excuse for partnering with a known scam site in bitcoin(.)com? Why are you hiring people who promote the BCash scam?
I know you have stated that you don't like how the BCash scammers are trying to hijack the Bitcoin name, so why on earth would you solidify a partnership with a god damn scammer and his malicious phishing site???

You haven't lost anything until you sell.
Here's just a short story: Back in 2013 my dad bought bitcoin at the VERY top of the first april bubble. I think his entry price was around 243 dollars. This was of course after hearing me going on and on about bitcoin for a while. It immediatley crashed to 50 usd, and my dad felt really stupid. I told him to just hold on to the btc and not worry about the short term price. He listened, and these days my dad is the proud owner of 9 BTC, worth a hell of a lot more than he purchased them for.
Moral is: Don't sell at a loss. If you do, you are **guaranteed** a loss. Chances of bitcoin bouncing back are huge imo. Just relax a bit and look at it long term. Good luck :)

Bitcoin can't scale effectively on-chain, that's just a fact, so layer 2 scaling is needed and coming in the form of Lightning Network and sidechains. The future is bright.
The idea that Segwit should "be reverted" sounds like the ramblings of a technically illiterate dimwit from r/btc. Nobody who has a clue would even consider that an option.
@_date: 2017-09-11 17:15:47
You are being dishonest. They aren't two different node implementations of Bitcoin, as one is deliberately diverging from the Bitcoin consensus rules and is therefore no longer Bitcoin. It then becomes something else, something new. I call it JeffCoin.
How is this hard to understand?
Even though JeffCoin has not diverged away from Bitcoin yet, and is still theoretically compatible, the intentions are clear are they not? We should protect Bitcoin however we can, and this seems like a good first step.
I don't feel we are cutting of our face at all, I'm not sure how you could arrive at that conclusion?
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:58:10

@_date: 2017-10-13 16:30:13
Yes I would. The community, devs, miners, businesses would all have to agree and consensus would have to be overwhelming and close to absolute for me to want that fork. I'd most likely just wait it out for the diff adjustment. I honestly don't think Bitcoin will ever have any consensus rule changes...ever again. I think the current consensus rules are basically set and too hard to change. This is what we get to work with and L2 is the way forward. I don't think that's a problem though, more a feature. This is just my opinion of course. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:07:11
The glaring flaw in your plan is that Coinbase is anti-Bitcoin and is currently attacking Bitcoin. They might end up calling the S2X shitcoin the "real Bitcoin". The fact that they are even remotely open to this idea is enough to never use them again. This is the "then they fight you..." phase and Coinbase is on the front line with their banker friends.
...and as always, if you don't control the private keys, you don't own any Bitcoin. With Coinbase you don't control your private keys.

You have no idea how much I actually agree with most of your points. The problem I have with you, is giving the guys at the attention they clearly hunger for but don't deserve. That, and calling us a cult over and over again. You clearly have no real life experience with a cult if you think this subreddit resembles a cult. It is a diverse group of people from all over the world, and I'm sick of being lumped in with those generalizations.
In regards to I have been there many times, I used to read it a lot back in the day when it was funny. Can you really not see how malicious and mean spirited it has become? Can you not see the amount of time and resources they spend on mocking one specific subreddit?
Oh btw, I don't know who accused you of being a "bought-and-paid government troll sent to undermine our economic revolution predicated on Bitcoin", but it sure as hell wasn't me, so wave your ironic finger in someone elses face. My only beef with you is becoming a mod at the trollcave and not being able to see how ridiculously inappropriate that is.
@_date: 2015-04-02 00:44:20
Well, theres a few obvious trolls in that comment section, like Ben (Bernanke) and cohagen, but not that many "organic" comments really. Those two trolls alone, make up a decent chunk of the comments, sadly.
But still, I agree with your point, and it's good to see such activity on a bitcoin article.
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:50:13
Are you kidding me? "...people this sub disagrees with" is a serious understatement when it comes to That subreddit is the equivalent of a bully. It exists only to piss off and troll It started out quite funny, but has turned more and more malicious and mean spirited. You should know better than to give them so much attention and start such drama.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against serious discussion about bitcoin and I'm ok with, and even encourage, weaknesses or faults being pointed out and discussed. So in that sense I agree with some of your points, but this is about the actions you took, and the rhetoric you use (cult, circlejerk, etc) that clearly make you unfit to moderate this sub. This thread is a good example, you come in throwing accusations around because you're probably on edge after recent happenings. Simply not appropriate.

Everything was dumb about it. First off BCH is not Bitcoin, and has really nothing to do with Bitcoin. If anything BCH proved that Bitcoin is resilient, since it was made to disrupt Bitcoin, but failed miserably.
It would be equally dumb to say that the creation of the Euro proved that you can inflate the dollar at the push of a button. You are either trolling or have absolutely no understanding of the topic at hand.
And when it comes to mining, they aren't being printed for no reason. It's part of the POW security model. Do you even understand Bitcoin?

I honestly don't think friedcat was a scammer at all. I think either some government agency, some triad members or some other random criminals got to him.

Can't you see that you're actually just projecting your own faults and insecurities onto others? There are plenty of people who bought bitcoin at a higher price than today, who aren't acting like you did and aren't experiencing these cultist beliefs. Get outta here with your "I know..." and "I can guarantee..." bullshit. YOU had a problem, and YOU did what you had to in order to fix it (sell your bitcoin), good for you.

Actually, speaking as someone who lived through both MtGox crashes, the first one in April, you most definitely could hodl through. 
The lag/ddos was causing panic, but you could just chill out and not do anything if you wanted, your funds were "safe" for another 8 months or so.
The second goxing was a bit worse, but even then there were A LOT of red flags and a lot of us pulled our funds out in time.

Well damn lol, I'm not sure if this is r/iamverysmart or material?  Or maybe a bit of both?
Anyways, since you pulled yours out in public, in dramatic fashion, I guess you can have a peek at mine ;) lol.
My resume is probably not as "Erlich Bachman" sounding as yours, but I have been into BTC since 2011. Been mining and investing in the space since very early 2012, and also own a IT company that has accepted BTC for over 5 years now. I've probably introduced over a hundred people to bitcoin by giving them some coin. I'm guessing somewhere between 50 and 100 BTC given out back in the early days. So I have done my fair share for Bitcoin I guess.
I dunno why you wrote a wall of text bragging about yourself in response to me calling out your comment about "nerds with fake internet money" and calling out spammers who try to shill Bcash.
IMO, It really wasn't clear from your comment that you were talking about yourself and calling, us, I guess, "nerds with fake internet money", but knowing now, that you meant it in an endearing sarcastic way, I'm not above apologizing. Sorry about that, from one nerd with fake internet money to another ;)
I won't however apologize for calling out those Bcash spammers who try to shill their stuff here. That stuff can fuck right off, all day, every day.

It really isn't. 
I understand the desire to keep bitcoin "free and unregulated", but there are probably a lot of businesses who aren't going to develop products and services around bitcoin until the chance of being shut down all of a sudden is minimized. Regulation will give companies clear rules to follow and minimizes the risk of doing something illegal without knowing it.
The beauty of bitcoin though, is that whoever thinks that these regulations are a joke, can just keep using bitcoin the way they want to anyways. The BitLicense will most likely be an important step for the future of bitcoin and I welcome it. Not because it affects me directly, or because I'm waiting for permission to do anything related to bitcoin, but because a lot of people out there actually do.
We can have these regulations, AND keep what is awesome about bitcoin at the same time. Just my opinion :)

So the talking head is hinting that the US dollar is better because we know who the "lender of last resort" is, but does that really change anything? If USD collapses (and I'm not saying that is imminent or will ever happen, relax buttcoiners haha), there is still nothing backing the USD in any meaningful way. So...USD backed by...eh...more freshly printed USD?
It seems to me he is using "backed by" (as in how currency was backed by gold back in the day) interchangeable with knowing the "lender of last resort". 
I might be totally off, but aren't those two different concepts? Like, a currency note backed by gold, would be completely different from one of todays currency notes, which is definitely not backed by gold, but for which we know who "the lender of last resort" is? Right?
Currency and money is indeed a tricky subject. I love how bitcoin is making me explore it more :)

It's frightening that you actually believe the lies that you spout.
Roger Ver is so far from an upstanding (lmao seriously?) man you could possibly be. He is a narcissistic sociopath serial scammer, who has far outdone the good he has done for Bitcoin, with his lies and propaganda about BCash. He is a snake and an enemy of Bitcoin.
You can't possibly mean that the disinformation campaign he has undertaken with sockpuppets and pay-per-retweet campaigns are the actions of an upstanding man? The way he tries to sell BCash as Bitcoin is nothing short of fraud and you should be ashamed for colluding with this scamming piece of shit.

Again "people with opposing viewpoints", does not adequately describe It's way beyond that, but we have been through this already and I guess we just disagree on the very nature of that subreddit.


Yeah...no, but thanks for assuming that. I have been "in bitcoin" since early 2012, own and run my own business (accepting btc ofc.), have about 8Th/s mining gear and ofc run a full node. I'm not new to bitcoin or this subreddit. I spend probably 2-3 hours here daily and have done so for the past few years. I just lurked for a while, and I guess I'm usually not very vocal so my post history is pretty slim. But overall, your assumption was pretty much a 1/10. I guess this conversation is over. Good luck with you business and have fun with the buttcoin guys.

That really depends on what chart you are looking at, and what timeframe you are considering. I suspect you only want to see the chart from the last year+ of the bear market. You might want to get some perspective. Here's another chart to counterbalance your bearchart: 
Now, I'm not saying we aren't in a long drawn out bear market, but be fair and don't lose perspective. 
There is definitely growth and adoption happening in bitcoin, across pretty much every metric except for price lately.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:26:48
This right here. It's very telling that some people can't for the life of them imagine anyone doing stuff for the betterment of both Bitcoin and mankind...while it simultaneously benefits oneself. It really says something about them to be honest. 
Keep up the good work Adam!

Keeping Bitcoin(BTC) and selling the shitcoin (B2X) as fast as possible would be your best option.
@_date: 2015-04-07 18:16:38
I can't answer for him, but how about you stop referring to our subreddit as a cult, that'd be great. 
I am sick of hearing cult, circlejerk, echochamber, etc. I hear this more than I see actual examples of cultish behaviour in this sub, and it's usually from buttcoiners. Then you actually joined the buttcoiners and are wondering why people in r/bitcoin is upset with you? Seriously...
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:57:21


I haven't, and won't, until you are proven as one.


Where do you have this from? I have made no such accusation. Please contain your imagination.
The emotional responses you give, littered with false accusations and paranoia, is making it even more clear that you are unfit as a moderator. You have done a great job in the past, from what I have heard, but I guess things change.
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:47:37
Your bitterness is not showing at all. Nope, not at all.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:28:36
Yes, that's what I mean by Bitcoin still being Bitcoin. 
Bottom line is, it doesn't matter what everyone else does, if we just run up to date Bitcoin Core nodes and make sure we are using the real Bitcoin. There will always be miners to mine Bitcoin, not everyone is in bed with the chinese mining cartel, and like you said there's plenty of outdated hardware that could come online. I'll probably fire up my old BFL, KNC and outdated Antminers(oh how I regret doing business with Jihan lol).
With the current price of Bitcoin and looking at the futures markets for the value of B2X/S2X, I think it's fair to say that while we might get some slowdown until the next difficulty readjustment, but there will always be plenty of miners wanting to get their hands on some Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:06:48
Can you not tell that the majority of users are against the hard-fork? The majority of bitcoin companies are also against the hard fork. The majority of nodes are Core nodes. This should be some indication.
These things are just a gauge of sentiment of course, but then you have the actual technical reason that Bitcoin will continue to be Bitcoin regardless of what happens: The longest valid chain will be Bitcoin, and Segwit2X is simply not going to produce a valid chain, simple as that. S2X nodes will break consensus, be banned from the rest of the valid bitcoin network, and that will be it.
The only thing giving the Segwit2X any hope at all is that a large part of the Chinese mining cartel is behind it. If they start mining S2X at a loss for some reason, this might slow down confirmations on the Bitcoin network for a while. The whole "95% of miners" figure is grossly exaggerated because it's just meaningless text, they aren't actually running software that will break consensus. It's a colossal step up from signalling support to actually running consensus breaking software.
A more pertinent question here would be: What on earth is making you think Bitcoin will be wiped out?
One more thing. Listen man, if you can't call Bitcoin by it's real name, I'm not going to continue this conversation with you. It's called Bitcoin, not B1X or S1X.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:24:32
You know what? I legitimately feel sorry for you. 
You are right smack in the middle of one of the most revolutionary technologies of our lifetime, and have every opportunity to take advantage of it...but instead you choose to be a misinformed and ignorant r/btc numpty.

@_date: 2018-07-31 00:42:35
You can mine bitcoin of course, but you can't do it with a phone and you certainly can't do it without investing a lot of money into specialized ASIC devices that are made to mine bitcoin efficiently.
Any site that promises you any non-negligible amount of bitcoin for downloading something, clicking something, or doing anything really...is 100% a scam. That's just the truth.
Simply put: Forget about mining. If you want Bitcoin, as you should IMO, cos it's fucking awesome, you need to buy it at an exchange, work for it, or exchange some service or goods for it.
Good luck out there and [welcome](
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:12:37
Out of curiousity, care to share these figures? I assume you have some data to back this up with, or how are you reaching this conclusion?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:50:18


That's exactly what you are saying you will do in the post though. It will be against the broader will of the community if you label S2X as Bitcoin just because some chinese mining cartel decides to mine that altcoin.
You have to understand that a large portion of bitcoiners will never treat S2X as Bitcoin, no matter what. 
"Don't support blatant attacks on Bitcoin." This should be an obvious rule of thumb for Bitcoin companies.

Remember, 3600 freshly mined bitcoin enter the market every single day, creating downwards pressure on the price.
A lot of miners are being squeezed by the long lasting bear market, and many have to immediately liquidate a lot of the mined coins to cover expenses.
Bitcoin is seeing a lot of growth in pretty much every other metric than the price. With the next halving coming up in 2016 and continued steady adoption I think bitcoin is looking pretty good these days. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:05:12

As far as I know, in Norway, bitcoin is still classed as a "digital service", which means a very unfortunate 25% VAT. I really hope they get their shit together soon, especially seeing these developments.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:49:02
Well, a global standard implies that everyone would have to agree on it globally. I simply don't see BNC in a position to actually get that done, but sure they can suggest all they want, and then see if anyone uses it or cares about it. My guess would be no.

I don't think reddit will be able to answer your question. You are probably better off contacting their support. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 21:29:56
Yeah after scouring the page I kinda realized it wasn't. Unfortunately that is kind of a dealbreaker for me. If the game is available on Steam, I want it on Steam. I'm almost ashamed to admit it haha.
It's actually funny how I, and many other gamers, were so reluctant to use Steam 10+ years ago. It was kinda forced upon us by good game titles from Valve. 
Now I love having a service that keeps all my games in one place, ready to install from stable servers that can max out my fiber connection. Decentralization is not always the preferred solution :)
Anyways, thanks for accepting bitcoin. I picked up a couple of steam keys for some other games I was meaning to get. Bitpay transaction was super smooth using Mycelium wallet. Good stuff guys :)
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:20:11

@_date: 2017-10-13 15:47:58
This is absolutely not good enough from Breadwallet.


Do they really not understand that this is a horrible idea since the 2 chains aren't using the same consensus rules. It's not in the spirit of "the longest valid chain is Bitcoin", because the damn S2X chain is NOT VALID.
They are basically saying there is a chance they will start being an altcoin wallet instead of a bitcoin wallet at some point when the chinese mining cartel decides so. 
Disappointed as hell with these guys. Claim to be pro user, but in reality they are taking a stand against the user and choose to stand with the corporate attack instead. Shame on them.
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:27:59
Oof, the dude's going to lose some stret cred when his gang finds out he bought into the BCash scam. 
Does he have a Bitconnect video as well? lmao
@_date: 2015-04-15 20:58:48
Yeah I understand those are good qualities to have when developing such systems, but I still feel it goes beyond that with him. He once proclaimed quite "loudly" that he sold half his bitcoins because he saw some "serious flaw" in bitcoin. Have a look at the mining pool charts now, looking pretty good actually, so not really a serious flaw. He wanted attention and reactions, that is my theory.
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:13:02
We have been seeing a lot of reports lately, of bitcoin related packages in the mail being subject to inspection and delay, for whatever reason. Maybe this could be a cause, or contributing factor? Did you not get any kind of tracking?
@_date: 2018-07-28 17:24:57
He is pretty much spot on. I guess LTC has value as a testnet for BTC though, other than that, they're all pretty much useless shitcoins.
If you're not a BTC maximalist, you don't really understand the crypto revolution and the value proposition of bitcoin, simple as that.
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:04:35
There is no chance the Bitcoin chain is dying in November, and if you think that, you simply don't understand Bitcoin.
Understand this, if 99% of miners start mining the S2X shitcoin, Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin. Crazy how that works huh.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:37:11
It's been thoroughly considered and rejected as a bad idea by the technical community.


It's not, we know it's not. We don't have to wait for it to cause massive problems to know it's a technically a bad idea.
@_date: 2015-09-08 14:25:28
It's not a source per se, but some anecdotal evidence I guess:
I own and run a PC repair shop in one of the biggest cities in Norway, and pretty much every single computer that comes through here has Popcorn Time installed.
It must be because the Netflix catalogue in Norway is pretty dismal.
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:47:15
Some interesting points for sure, but the blog has a very strong anti-bitcoin bias seeping through for sure. It honestly reads as if it was written by a Buttcoiner. It's not all nonsense though, don't get me wrong, it just presents all the arguments with that typical snark we are getting so used to from those guys.
The arguments and discussion would just be more valuable without that obvious bias and snark, that's all.
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:22:57


You mean Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:55:22
I don't think you understand how this works. 
When "the dust clears" Bitcoin will still be the ***longest valid chain***, there is literally no way it can't be, because B2X is changing the consensus rules, so it is, factually and beyond any doubt, an altcoin. This is basic Bitcoin stuff. Try to keep up.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:29
What is the reasoning behind possibly switching from Bitcoin to an altcoin? 
2SX is not going to be Bitcoin, this is pretty obvious at this point. 
So to be clear: If the attack gains, let's say 60% hashrate, are you really going to label this altcoin as Bitcoin to your customers?
I have been recommending Breadwallet/Bread App left and right in the past years, but can't in good faith continue to do so if you aren't going to continue being a Bitcoin wallet.
This weak ass "neutral" stance, disguised as "pro user" is doing you no favors IMO. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:56:25

Look, I don't think this necessarily proves why bitcoin is the future either, and I'm also here. Stop generalizing.

First off, they sound like complete morons calling Bitcoin Segwit1X, and the first thing I get up when googling them is some ICO scam.
My initial reaction is fuck these guys, but I'm open to arguments as to why these guys, or this ignorant poll, is in any way relevant. Anyone?
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:53:37
To begin with, I actually just downvoted you because I saw you bitching about downvotes. Then I checked your history, and I think your 4 hour long buttcoin career explains a lot. 
Your contribution to this subreddit is simply negative. Not negative in terms of constructive criticism or healthy discussion about the weaknesses in bitcoin, but just generally negative in the sense that you contribute nothing. Your comments are snyde and rude and that's why you get downvotes. It's not that hard to figure out really.

You do understand that S2X even with majority hashrate will not be Bitcoin right? Longest ***valid*** chain and all that... Obviously you do, but the post makes me wonder.
EDit: You didn't answer the question though. If the attack gains, let's say 60% hashrate, are you really going to label this altcoin as Bitcoin to your customers?

Well, if we really want to dig down to the root of the problem here, I guess it's the scammers pushing that garbage Bcash without changing the address format.

@_date: 2018-04-24 16:58:40
So if someone made a website trying to sell you gold bullion, but when you think you purchased gold, you actually got gold plated lead instead. Would that not be a scam? Of course it would. 
Still, the lead itself would not be the scam, just like code itself can't be scam.
@_date: 2018-04-17 13:00:31


...then proceeds to write pure FUD.
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:15:00
BCash will most likely be 9% or under. Regardless of the recent pump from Roger &amp; Co, the trend is very clear, the market has spoken and BCash has lost and will keep sliding.
BCash serves no real purpose other than being a vehicle for Roger &amp; Co to scam new users with their lies and propaganda. If it wasn't for the scummy tactics and lies, Bcash wouldn't even be in the top 25 cryptos. It's a straight up scam.
You should try facing this reality at some point, since the faster you do, the better off you'll be.

Getting a bit tired of this false equivalence bullshit. Bcash is a centrally controlled scamcoin and is not really competing with bitcoin in any real sense. The scammers behind it just prey on the uninformed.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:35:23
No, not at all like bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is used a lot actually. It's in fact being used so much, by so many people, that scaling can barely keep up. 
If you spent half the time you do being an insufferable troll on reddit, and actually spent some time learning about bitcoin, you would understand.
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:12:34
The vast vast majority is though. In my estimates, more than 99% of all cryptocurrencies have no purpose or even future, other than making certain people money of course. If you consider premines and other shady stuff, there is pretty much just Bitcoin left that's not a scam in some way or another.
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:16:48
Why would you use a scam wallet, downloaded from a scam site, created by scammers?
Get a real Bitcoin wallet lol
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:26:20


lmoa, and there it is. /smh
BCash is actually the worst scam of them all. It is centrally controlled and serves no purpose other than lining the pockets of certains scammers. I can't be bothered discussing that blatant scam with you though, because if you haven't figured it out so far, chances are you are in on the scam and buy into the ridiculous "BCash is Bitcoin" bullshit. I just can't be bothered, you can find the truth with minimal effort if you really wanted to, so there's that. 
On to Ethereum. The Ethereum blockchain is not immutable, so maybe not an outright scam, but it is centrally controlled, severely limiting its usefulness.
Monero and Litecoin are interesting and not scams I would agree.
That's about it though. I'd say most others are scams or at least overhyped in a dishonest way. So that's like a small handful out of several thousand. I'd say the meme was pretty spot on.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:35:53
His perceived credibility takes a hit when he starts shilling Dash in the middle of the report.

@_date: 2017-05-04 22:30:37
I was just trying to make a lighthearted joke for a change, but sure, I'll bite :)
While I am generally no fan of altcoins, they do serve a purpose and have the right to thrive, if the markets allow them. 
I agree we don't really need multiple mediums of exchange, but there is no harm in improving/innovating. Going from barter to anything from gold, to fiat, and perhaps soon bitcoin, has been great improvements for civilization. I think it's great that people keep innovating on bitcoin and making alternative cryptocurrencies. It's a great way to test features we might want for Bitcoin later. 
Besides, we can't just go out and "eradicate" them lol, just like governments can't do the same with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:16:08
You're posting screens from some altcoin pump powerpoint presentation, with obvious exaggerations and hyperbole about how bad bitcoin is... What do you expect?
Why would you even include the altcoin name at the bottom there, with the cute little bitcoin 2.0 spiel? It's laughable if you think people don't see though your asinine attempt to pump your altcoin. 
This is some shit right here.
Welcome to reddit btw, please stop trying to pump your altcoin here.

@_date: 2017-05-30 12:38:31
Nah, you are just missing vision and imagination.
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:46:12
It's not really tribal mentality though. It's just experience in the space (7 years) and an understanding of the actual value proposition of bitcoin. You should be able to recognize when someone takes a great thing like Bitcoin, completely destroys it, and then tries to market it as something it's not. BCash the protocol might not be a scam in itself, it's obviously just software, but the way it came into existence, and the blatant lies attached to it, and everyone pushing it, is so scammy it actually hurts.
If you don't get why BCash is useless(hint: it's not decentralized), that's ok. Still doesn't make it less scammy and if you want to attach your name to that steaming pile, go ahead. Keep in mind though, that history will not be kind to the many scammers pushing Bcash.
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:15:54
Your math just perfectly showed why we need to **optimize** how the 1MB is actually utilized (segwit, schnorr etc.) instead of just increasing it.
Some people just need to face the fact that bitcoin can't accommodate every single transaction on-chain if it goes mainstream, and that's OK, it's still amazing tech. Off/side-chain scaling will be a great solution for everyday small transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:12:23
Hey, at least you are one of the trolls that actually admit that you're just trolling on Reddit. I guess i commend you for that.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:26:30
I agree to some extent, but it's not like we are 7 year olds calling each other "poopyhead" in the schoolyard here. When Ver/Jihan is being called negative things, it's usually with good reason. Jihan/Ver are on a seriously destructive path and I will never stop calling out their dishonesty and bullshit. I'll fight for bitcoin until the day I die.
I'm against child-like tactics too, but if you think that's gonna stop me or anyone else from calling out liars and dishonest actors, you need to think again.
 I think I understand what you are trying to point out, but I think you are barking up the wrong tree and is coming across as an apologist for people who are very bad for bitcoin. That's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:53:21
They took money from Jihan/Bitmain and their stance on Segwit changed drastically after that. Surprise surprise, now their stance is more in line with Jihans, go figure huh.
@_date: 2017-05-09 16:23:42
It's popular because it's the best iteration of money the world has ever seen. Some use it for buying stuff online, some use it for remittances, some for saving/store of value, some for crime/avoiding prying eyes, etc. It has plenty of solid use cases.

They have been the most popular wallet for years, and naturally have had some problems. Still, the irrational hate this subreddit seems to have for blockchain.info is not really warranted.
As someone else mentioned, they are not responsible for the congestion in the bitcoin network though. In my opinion we can blame Jihan Wu for this.

At this point it honestly just sounds like a pride thing...as if we must compromise, just for the sake of compromising and not conceding or whatever.
**Segwit is good to go right NOW,** **developed and tested for years**. 
1MB is fine for now, since Segwit gives an immediate effective blocksize increase and allows for efficient implementation of other promising tech.
I just don't get why so many people refuse to listen to the guys who are the most technically adept in the bitcoin space. 
Have you seriously not realized that pretty much all the tech-savvy guys who actually knows how bitcoin works at every level, are all pro Core/Segwit? I'd actually appreciate it if you answered this one, because it really baffles me.
And btw, what you call "dicking around", the actual devs call writing and testing code. Go figure.
@_date: 2017-05-15 17:19:13
Around 240 satoshi/Byte should get you in the next block if that's what you mean. Lower is ofc a "better" fee if your transaction is less important and doesn't absolutely have to be included in the next block.

I agree with you sentiment, except Bitcoin definitely makes sense as a day to day currency, just not on-chain. 
Keeping layer 1 decentralized and secure should be top priority, as we continue to scale via layer 2 tech. Segwit and LN seems to be the way forward.
I honestly think we can have both. The best store of value, AND the best day to day currency in the world. That is the Bitcoin I dream about, and fight for.

It seems like 120 sat/B is a very commom fee. 
I suspect some of the bigger wallets use this as a default fee or something, so if you want to get away with using "low" fees, I would at least always make sure your fee is 121 sat/B or more to even have it confirm at all.
Good luck with your trip...umm sorry, I mean with your transaction ;)
@_date: 2017-05-20 18:24:23


How does that change anything I said, or even matter at all in this instance? It's still an altcoin, and you're still pumping it in the wrong sub.


Umm, no...I will not hold my tongue just because you find it uncomfortable to be called out. If you don't like being called out shilling for altcoins, don't shill for altcoins in r/bitcoin. Simple.


What? How is this relevant to me calling you out for shilling an altcoin exactly?
You got nothing dude, except excuses and more shilling. And just to be clear, I'm not dissing the altcoin specifically, I have nothing against this one or any other altcoin, just don't blatantly shill for it here in r/bitcoin. People will call you out, always. Have a good night.

@_date: 2017-05-20 14:24:08
Lightning Network, Schnorr signatures and hopefully lots of other cool stuff. We need Segwit first though, so BIP148 is the way to go at this point.
People really need to open their eyes and realize that bitcoin will NEVER scale to visa levels on layer 1. Therefore our best bet is to keep layer 1 as secure and decentralized as possible, while making the crazy 1000x+ scaling stuff on layer 2.
If anyone thinks that we can have bitcoin go mainstream and have all transactions globally on layer 1, they are simply wrong and don't understand how it works.

You are operating multiple accounts and sockpuppeting. I received a reply from you yesterday that was identical to a reply from another user in another thread. Here you are replying the same thing twice from different accounts.
Looks like these are all the same person or organization: u/naturecollision and u/DerSchorsch
Why are you doing this? I mean, there is a chance that someone is just copying replies or whatever, but this just seems really strange.

The BTC or dollar amount of the transaction doesn't matter, what matters is the fee per Byte, or satoshi/Byte.
The fee for this transaction was 79.7 sat/B, which is way too low at this point in time for such a large transaction (large as in Bytes).
If you want lower fees, you should help move bitcoin forward by advocating for Segwit and LN, which are currently the best proposed ways to scale bitcoin.  
You should honestly have read the stickied post in this subreddit before posting this.

It's probably a matter of principle, one I understand and appreciate. 
It is perfectly reasonable to forego some benefits now, to reap a greater benefit sometime down the road, or even just the chance of a greater benefit. 
Remember, in the early days, bitcoin wasn't useful at all. Some people kept at it though, kept using it, kept spreading the word of the potential benefits...until one day, it was tremendously beneficial. In my opinion has the right idea, as long as he can afford to give the discount :)

Very few things in every-day life are that expensive though. You get around 45.000 satoshis for a dollar. Doesn't sound too bad imo.

He isn't going to respond with what you want from him/her. 
There is a clear trend of certain people talking down segwit and/or BIP148, but without any technical argument behind it, and refusing to be clear about their "objections".

OK, so people had large amounts of both USD and BTC on Mt.Gox. Then USD withdrawals halted, so the only way to get your funds out of Mt.Gox, was to BUY bitcoin and withdraw. This caused an enormous upwards pressure on the price of bitcoin on Mt.Gox. 
Still hazy? ;)
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:12:04
If you bought in at the IPO price of 0.1 BTC and never sold, you have actually multiplied your investement many times over from dividends alone. 
Heck, I remember one week back in 2013 the dividend was  like 0.038 BTC per share. That's over 1/3 of your initial investment paid back in one week.
If I'm not mistaken you should have made somewhere around 600-700% profit on your investment, that's not counting whatever the value of the shares are today. So chin up :)

Buying games on steam is always really smooth for me. I have made maybe 8-12 purchases and 0 problems. I use Mycelium on Android (priority fee) for these purchases. 
I'm not saying you're not experiencing the problems you say you are, but just providing some additional anecdotal evidence that it can also be a very smooth experience if you just pay the correct fee.
Your statement: "Buying games on Steam with Bitcoin( with Bitpay) is a nightmare." is objectively wrong. **You** experienced a nightmare perhaps, but there are certain reasons for this, and you could have done certain things to avoid it.
TL;DR: Buying games from Steam with Bitcoin through BitPay is very smooth for me and many other users. OP didn't pay the required fee for the transaction size.

What, exactly, is looking shady as fuck about it? Genuine question btw.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:35:01
I honestly think that if there was any way to properly enforce the 2MB HF that supposedly comes 3 months after segwit activation (hint: it won't), there would not be nearly as much support.
At this point I think a lot of people just want Segwit activated and will say and do whatever to get it activated. Since there is no real way to enforce the HF, there is really no downside to the NYA. We get segwit and can proceed to tell the 2x HF numpties to fork off after. 
One could argue this is "dirty or dishonest", but at this stage of the attack, we need to do whatever we can to fight back. We just need to get segwit activated, and avoid increasing base block size in the short term. This gives us time to assess other ways of scaling in a more responsible timeline.

Downvoted for trying to defend cloudmining scam.
Cloudmining is always a scam. If the "customers" (victims) could actually make money from cloudmining, the company selling the hashrate wouldn't sell it, would they? They would just mine for themselves and make more money. It's just simple logic.
That being said, I'm not complaining about the contents of your article, and I can see it being useful to certain people. Still, you will  get absolutely no support from me, as long as you are pushing cloud mining scams. It's unethical, and you deserve the criticism.

Interesting math, but with Bitcoin I feel it's a little different.^^^TM
Bitcoin is more than just currency. It is also, maybe even predominantly, a store of value. This combined with the fixed amount of bitcoin, I'm not so sure the math is as simple as you presented. I think the road to 1 million would actually be "easier".

I'm honestly curious...Are you actually not aware that a lot of people went along with the segwit2x "compromise" just to get segwit locked in and activated, but have no interest in a rushed hardfork in 3 months? 
I don't believe for a second that the "majority supports" an additional block size increase after Segwit. The bitcoin community wanted Segwit, and we did what we had to do(UASF and the NYA "compromise"), to get the non-technical big-block numpties and the mining cartel go go along with it. It hasn't been pretty but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.
Segwit will be activated on Bitcoin very shortly, but the other block size increase, the one that is supposed to happen in a few months...Well, it's probably not gonna happen. At least not to what will still be called Bitcoin. Sure, some people might fork off and make an alt-coin, but it won't be Bitcoin.
Most actual bitcoiners want the segwit part, which is a smart blocksize increase, and don't want a rushed hardfork in a few months with a dumb blocksize increase. In short, I don't think the support behind the NYA, actually represents the support for the 2x part at all. We just wanted Segwit activated without any more stalling and bullshit from the miners.
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:36:20

I could support a blocksize increase to 2MB for sure. But, and that's a big but, only when it is actually needed, and the actual bitcoin developers and engineers deem it safe, and the software is properly tested and bug free. Then, and only then, can we talk about a blocksize increase.
This would naturally exclude a fork to 2MB in three months, as that is not enough time.
What certain corporations have decided in some secret meeting is of no concern to me, and many other bitcoiners. The Bitcoin community wanted Segwit, and now we will hopefully get that. 
To somehow think we owe something to the same group of people who were preventing the upgrade in the first place is laughable.

Moving on, with the knowledge that bitcoin can't scale to accommodate everyones transactions on-chain, our best bet is to make second-layer tech as good as it can be. Segwit is the first step towards this, and paves the way for an efficient implementation of LN.
Just straight-up increasing the block size is a very crude way of moving forward when we have other, technically superior solutions.

Unless you have an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) that is specifically made to mine bitcoin, you can't really mine bitcoin in any meaningful way.
You can however mine a variety of altcoins(like Bytecoin) and then just immediately convert them to bitcoin. 
What kind of hardware are you planning on mining with? As in, what graphics card or CPU are you using? Maybe I can give you some advice.

He keeps saying there will be 2 bitcoins if Bitmain do the UAHF with their BitcoinABC or Bitcoin Cash or whatever. This is not true, Bitcoin will remain Bitcoin, and Bitmains new thing will be an alt. It really is as simple as that. 
I normally don't like Coinbase much, but in this case they are taking the right stance. We can't just let anyone fork off and make an alt-coin, and think it will be instantly accepted and traded everywhere. It will be harmful to (the real) Bitcoin, and at the same time, create more work for their engineers. On top of that, they will be breaking the NYA by forking off, so of course it will meet resistance.
Personally I won't even care about JihanCoin, it's just a non-issue that can easily be ignored, and I'm glad Coinbase see it that way too.

XRP is a premined scam. Why would you trade your BTC for it?
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:03:08
So let us do a quick summary.
You admit you were being dishonest (even if not on purpose) in your original post, something I call you out for.
You proceed to call me ignorant, and a joke. Then accuse me of "cussing you out" when I did no such thing. The only personal insults actually came from you, not me.
You then storm out of here proclaiming you'll find some other crypto assets to diversify. Does this mean you lost interest in BTC because you felt I was being mean to you? Is that it? LMAO
Good luck to you man, you'll need it out there.
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:44:13
I'm sorry, but your comment is incredibly ignorant, even for a buttcoin troll.
This is obviously not a bitcoin problem, and the fact that you make it out to be a bitcoin problem, tells me you don't really understand the technology at all. 
You can thank the government for the KYC/AML procedures in place at the various exchanges. If you use the bitcoin system by itself, there are no KYC/AML rules or arbitrary restrictions.
I don't use Cryptsy, and don't really want to defend them in any way, but it seems likely that they are just covering their own asses, as a lot bitcoin companies are under a lot of scrutiny these days.
There certainly are some flaws and limitations with bitcoin, but this is not one of them. You missed the target completely.

This is simply not true. Maybe it's not satisfactory to you, but it sure is to most technically adept people in bitcoin. 
We all want to scale bitcoin, but optimizing the way we utilize current block space(Segwit, Schnorr sig., etc), is simply a much better way of scaling than increasing the block size. When we run out of ways to optimize, then we can look at increasing the actual block size. 
It's the smart and conservative (non political use of word ofc) way to do it, regardless of how satisfactory you find the explanation. 
You not understanding the technical explanations, doesn't mean they aren't satisfactory. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:41:19

Are you being serious? He came in to the bitcoin subreddit and started calling us names and being a dick.
I have no problem with people not investing in, not liking or even disliking bitcoin. That's all fine. The problem occurs when he comes in here talking shit.
If anything, what actually is a serious problem for this community, is the amount of trolling and divisiveness coming from outside subs like r/btc, r/buttcoin and now r/investing. People like you defending them doesn't help the community at all either.

Ah yes, I think I might have misunderstood this post. 
I took it as "the sky is falling! Just watch this video and hear what this man says. There will be 2 bitcoins etc etc."
I probably should have interpreted it like: "Look guys, it might be best to hold off on buying bitcoin until this whole thing blows over, since the market can be irrational and even though it's looking quite good right now, there will be more blood before it's back on moon trajectory."
If that's the case, I agree, it's a fair warning :)

Just started and genuinely wondering huh? More like you're a long time investor in ETH and is frustrated it's still lagging behind bitcoin? Here is a quote from you 5 days ago:


Then you follow up with this:


You're just concern trolling, and it's easy as hell to see that you're not here "genuinely wondering."
Here are the simple facts: No blockchain that is sufficiently decentralized and secure, will ever scale to service all transactions on the base layer. Scaling has to be done on layer 2, like LN. It's working right now, and is the best scaling solution we have.
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:24:09
I'm honestly not sure this is genuine (Hi Roger?!) but I'll bite. 
Soon you will be able to use bitcoin for super cheap and with instant confirmation using something called Lightning Network. 
Bitcoin is evolving, and while it might not suit your use-case (not sure what that is though, considering your $4 purchase) right now, it most likely will in 6 months time. It takes time to perfect new technology. 
Maybe you should just leave it be for now, and check it out again when the tech is more mature and user friendly.

As a european I would recommend getting verified and buying on bitstamp.net. They are one of the longest running exchanges, and have a good rep. I've personally never had a problem with them at least.
Once you have made your purchase, transfer the coins to a wallet where you control the keys. I would recommend getting a Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet. Only buy direct from the manufacturer, no ebay or similar sites.
Spend and replace bitcoin, anywhere Bitcoin is accepted. This helps merchant adoption and growth.
Don't brag about your BTC holdings, as you might become a target.
Avoid the temptation of trying to find "the next bitcoin", and investing your BTC into altcoins, or AKA shitcoins.
Whenever you do anything in this space, triple check your URLs and receiving addresses etc. Lots of phishing and scams about, and they all want your bitcoin. Be smart and vigilant, don't let them have your coins.
Hope you have a good day too!
Good luck, and [welcome to bitcoin](

Well, I didn't agree to any 2x hardfork, and neither did any of the many bitcoiners I know IRL. 
What a bunch of corporations decided behind locked doors is of no consequence to me. We were getting segwit anyways, since that was actually what the majority of users wanted, as well as pretty much every competent engineer in the bitcoin space. 
Thinking we somehow owe some 2x hardfork down the line, just because the miners finally stopped dicking around and did their job, is laughable at best.
Maybe we will do a 2x hardfork down the road if it's needed, but stop thinking we somehow owe anyone a 2x hardfork. It's ridiculous.

That's simply not true at all. Bitcoins hashrate is something like 5 orders of magnitude higher than ETH.

Safest cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, hands down. Nothing even comes close.
Here is some advice:
Buy Bitcoin, and store them safely in a manner where you control the keys. A hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor is recommended.
Spend and replace bitcoin wherever you can. This helps merchant adoption and growth, while not reducing your bitcoin stash.
Don't brag about your holdings, as you might become a target.
Don't waste your time, or money, on shitcoins. Unclear on what a shitcoin is? If it's not Bitcoin, it's a shitcoin. Simple really.

That's really low effort. 
If there is data showing what you claim, please show it. If not, please don't spread misinformation.
I think you mean "addresses" instead of "people" tbh...There is no way to know the people behind the addresses. It's very likely that addresses with a lot of BTC belong to exchanges and services, so what many count as "1 person", could in reality be tens of thousand of people.

The mining difficulty is controlled by the difficulty algorithm in the Bitcoin protocol. Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, or roughly every 2 weeks. Simply put, the algorithm tries to produce one block every 10 minutes, and if blocks are produced at a faster rate, the difficulty is adjusted up, and if blocks are produced slower, the difficulty goes down.
As for hyperinflation, this is not an issue with Bitcoin. The supply of bitcoin is predictable and known to all, as defined in the protocol. This is one of the core attributes that makes bitcoin so special.
Tbh, it sounds like you need to cover some of the basics, so here are a few good sources of information and resources to help you learn more about Bitcoin :)

BTC was not premined. That's just a fact, and your trolling and shilling won't change that. 
Not a lot of people cared to mine in the beginning of course, since it was the first cryptocurrency and the concept and process was not on many peoples radar. I think the first mined coins "died" with Satoshi anyways. 
Either way, your point is moot and XRP is just another scam from the bankers. Sucks to be suckered, I get it.

That they are trying to push it as bitcoin of course, when it clearly is not. 
The code itself can't be a scam of course, but just like a gold bar loaded with tungsten isn't inherently illegal or a scam, however when you try to palm it off as the real deal, it becomes a scam.
People are constantly trying to fork (basically copy/paste) bitcoin and claim it's the real deal, and BSV is no different. Actually this one is so blatantly a scam that a lot of the big exchanges have gone as far as delisting it, not allowing the trading of it.
And to touch on the "censorship" he talks about here, it's basically a reaction to people like him trying to push their scams on unsuspecting users here, and the mods obviously try to moderate that sort of noise. These guys usually start crying about censorship, when the mods actually do a good job keeping these charlatans at bay. I wouldn't be surprised if that guys comments will be removed, with good reason.

No, bitcoin has never been ready for micropayments at scale. This will hopefully change soon with Segwit and layer 2 tech like LN though.
It is only because so few people used bitcoin in the early days, you could get away with low/zero fee payments, but it has never been, and never will be, realistic to do micropayments on-chain. This is a fact that many people seem to have problems understanding.

They haven't actually lost anything on any investement until they sell at a lower price.  
Even though past performance is not an indication of future results, the drop in value we are seeing now is really nothing new in bitcoin. Most of those people who bought at $1200 will be fine, if they just don't panic sell at a lower price.

Why has gone completely silent as of 5 days ago? This is some seriously shady stuff and he should be careful not to completely ruin his reputation in the bitcoin space. I'm very disappointed, not gonna lie :(

You know everyone can see your post history, right?
You're active in gpumining and cryptocurrency sub, plus a bunch of shitcoin subs, and you want us to believe you don't understand what an unconfirmed transaction is?
Pretty low effort concern trolling dude.

No shitcoin can provide what bitcoin provides, and especially XRP, as it is a premined scam. 
If you want to transact on the most secure and decentralized blockchain, it's going to cost you a fee, sure, but thinking some centralized shitcoin actually is a viable alternative, just exposes the fact that you don't understand the value proposition of bitcoin.

I would agree if there was any acceptable reasons for not implementing Segwit yet...but there just aren't any.
They should definitely be called out and pressured publicly.

Oh really? Please do tell.....
Your post history is literally just all shitcoins and scamcoins. I guess you'll learn the hard way.

Except your friend maybe?
Sounds like a case for law enforcement IMO.

Oh, also my first ever reddit post! :)

Volume where? What move? What are "these things"? Bitcoin or merchandise from SR?
Please try to make sense in order to start a discussion.
Edit: Saw the username...sorry to feed the troll. Nothing to see here, move along.

I hope so too man, good luck.
It's not unlikely you will get your money now. Some scammers only scam the ones who take it, and those who complain publicly gets theirs. Maybe you are lucky and this is the case.
Either way, I would never use them (again).

Yup, same here. It was brilliant! :)
The way Sam prematurely reveals the final hashrate when stacking the paper at 0:40 cracked me up. They are going to have some laughs over that one. 
Good work by the KNC team, now we just need the miners configured, tested, shipped and deployed!
