1000+ right nw which is more than 10mil usd
@_date: 2019-07-22 10:30:36
Probably 10mil and above you can do anything without working.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:08:24
by this reasoning we should go 100% all in in alts right now lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:55:57
as more people buy the coin its volatility will decrease. I srs doubt it will ever dip to 7k right now. the most correction it would ever see is 30% max.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:18:45
would be worth 10 million now if you hold them lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:28:31
what the...And how is bitcoin going to be a good mode for transferring money with this kind of ridiculous fees?
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:22:35
i believe it would be much more stable in 5years
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:21:13
its still not too late. if you buy now and dollar cost average monthly with your salary, in 5 years from now you might be a millionaire or multi-millionaire.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:05:55
just put in abit at a time if you're that scared if not you will be saying the same thing again when it reaches 100k lol

What makes bitcoin unique is the bitcoin network/users and its long history of 10 years and being the largest market cap which makes it the most robust and safest crypto.
Its like what makes facebook or instagram unique?
Its users. You can go create a facebook or instagram copycat but no one is going to use it.

What are you talking about lol.
I said 1 bitcoin could equal $400k if it matches gold market cap.
It doesnt mean gold has to decrease in market cap. All the world's money arent in just these two assets. Money could flow out of stocks for e.g to bitcoin.

@_date: 2019-03-18 11:08:07
Lets say btc goes to 100k in next bull rum which is a reasonable estimate then 100 btc = $10million
@_date: 2019-03-29 03:55:57
1btc could be potentially worth 400k to several millions based on my calculations.
400k it would be digital gold and equal to golds market cap. Several millions it would be world currency or widely adopted currency.
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:43:52

The monetary system is based on debt. Bankers create money from debt when you take a loan. Also, because banks are allowed by law to only hold 10% in cash in someone banks account they can lend out or invest 90% of it. This practice will grow money and debt exponentially. This kind of system is unsustainable as the debt bubble grows and grows. It will be like a house of cards and will eventually pop some time.
All fiat ultimately goes to zero. Even the longest surviving currency the british pound has lost something like -99.5% of its actual value.
Gresham's law. Bad money will chase out good money from circulation. People will use bad money like fiat and hodl good money like bitcoin thereby increasing bitcoin's value long term.

Well since bitcoin has been compared to digital gold by many. I am just using gold as a basis for the market cap. 
Given that bitcoin is a relatively new asset. One can say it has not done growing and could potentially reach 400k (Or more).
Yes, its just an estimate like you said. It could be 400k or even more or less. Gold's market cap could grow,shrink or even stay stagnant in the mean time. Well, you may think 400k is an arbitrary number, but its still better than random guessing.
I guess no one can predict the future. I am just listing out a bitcoins potential, a possibility. By no means this is sure evidence or anything. There are some benefits that bitcoin has that gold doesnt like being easily divisible and it can be send anywhere worldwide in an instant, but gold wins in the fact it has a long history as a store of value and also it looks pretty, can be made to jewelry.

Ive seen high stakes poker players losing 500k IN ONE SINGLE HAND and they just laugh it off. 
But I believe Bill Gates is in a mentality that he cant be poor ever unless he does something really stupid so the 2.8 mil loss wont bother him as much as you think. He will notice it but not be bothered if it were just normal flutuations in his assets.

I dont think we will ever go 100% crypto. They will still be uses for fiat. Usage of crypto in future will be like credit/debit cards now. It can and very likely will exist together with fiat. Yes value of crypto will increase over time but at a point in the future gains wont be as much as it is now.  People can sell or use crypto if they feel price is overvalued. Like how people sell houses today.

Just religiously put in $50 every month. Over the years it will grow unless something drastic happens and another coin becomes in favor instead of bitcoin.
Sell when you need the money or when it reaches bubble status like back in dec 2017
@_date: 2019-08-17 02:23:57
Cause the market was stagnant then and i was expecting a drop. Besides btc rest of the alts were barely moving or down.

Not that simple. It may work for 90% of the time but in a downtrend RSI remains downwards or when it goes back up prices are lower then when you bought in.

As much as you are comfortable with in a volatile asset.

From the moving averages, it points to btc bottom is already near or have already been reached.
@_date: 2019-02-26 11:15:37
Over extended prices. It went from 200 to 20k in 2 years. That is a 100x increase mind you.

The point he keeps pumping predictions after numerous wrongs. He should just shut up about the predictions already.
@_date: 2019-04-06 06:25:06
In a sense you can never predict where a stock will go especially intraday movements.
I think support/resistances are very valid though. As someone else said, its a self fufilling prophecy. Its easy to see where the "value" is if a stock always bounces off a certain price, thus making that a strong support as everyome rushes to buy at that price.
But for me a lot are nonsense like Fibonacci Retracements and Elliot Waves etc...
@_date: 2019-08-20 05:44:36
Im seeing where this could go wrong. You will start buying alts with the 50k for a quick chance to turn it into a million but then it crashes and you own everyone tons when btc appreciates alot.
