China‘s government restricts basically everything which isn’t controlled by them... China never was and never will be bullish on a open source solution like Bitcoin. This narrative is bullshit.
Just because they say that the blockchain technology has some potential, that doesn’t mean they will now publicly support Bitcoin.
Just like with every other popular service (FB, Insta, WhatsApp etc), they will censor it and create a centralized version for it.
I know that you can’t censor BTC, but no one will risk their freedom if the government doesn’t allow it. 
Even billionaires have no power in their own country and are getting hunted if they don’t follow their plan. What makes you think that the average Joe will have a choice?

Are you working for CNBC Crypto?

No, even with leverage trading you can‘t lose more than the initial $25 on crypto exchanges which are offering derivatives.

That's awesome. Well, then I would also highly recommend BTCPay Server.

If you can afford to accept and actually (temporarily) hold the received Bitcoins, I would suggest you using BTCPay Server: btcpayserver dot org. Works fine, but you have to be aware of the risks of potential losses if BTC price drops overnight and you forget to sell it which means your BTC lost 5-10% in USD value for example.
If the first option is too risky for your business, then I would try bitpay dot com for example, where you've a protection against the price volatility included.

Yeah.. I know.. but the origin of this whole thing is his claim to be Satoshi.

P2P.. There are a lot of Bitcoin or in general crypto meetups in Germany.. build a small network and buy / sell it directly for cash without any kind of KYC or other verification.
It takes a little bit more time afford but I'm personally a big fan of it. I'm making all my crypto purchases that way and it's working great for small amounts up to 5k.

I don’t see a difference here tbh. Both are misleading people with lies.. Craig claims he‘s Satoshi the other one, Roger, uses the name „Bitcoin“ but actually he means Bitcoin Cash. 
Just take bitcoin.com for example; „Bitcoin Paper Wallet“, „Bitcoin Wallet“, but after clicking on „create Bitcoin wallet“ you get a Bitcoin Cash wallet.
If his intentions would be honest he would make clear that Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Cash are two different things.
At the end in my opinion both are narcissistic people with a strange personality and the only thing they care about is their own wealth.
And just to make it clear: I don‘t hate the coins itself.. but the way how Craig &amp; Roger are promoting them is a no-go and it‘s not far away from being a scam.

If they delist BCHSV because of CSW lies.. than they have to delist BCHABC as well because the way Roger lies and promotes he's BCash coin is the same shit as CSW claims he's Satoshi.

Agree.. if Bitcoin should really become that big, then banks will just adapt. Which is necessary because the average person will not install wallets, syncing blockchains and save all the keys. And that's my point.. banks will remain but adapt their business if Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will become that big.

Seems you don't want to use exchanges? Maybe try to find some crypto people in your city.. in my case for example I'm buying and selling from private people with cash. I met them during blockchain and crypto seminars, events and meet ups. Especially when you are in a country were crypto is restricted, this can be an awesome solution as you are for sure not the only one who is trying to buy and sell Bitcoin.
I know it's an unconventional way where you have to be a little bit creative.. but once you've a small network of people, you're completely independently from exchanges, delayed withdrawal etc. For small amounts up to $25k or so, the perfect way in my opinion.

Well.. she probably don't know that this coin was their life savings.

24h is a damn low time frame for moving such a huge amount of money.. I would suggest moving your funds into Tether and sell it on Bittrex for USD for example.. but if you don't have any other full verified crypto accounts it's impossible to move your USD into USDT and sell it on an other exchange as you have to be verified before making such a huge deposit.
So, an other option is to create a Bitcoin paper wallet (for example [ It's done within seconds), move the $290'000 into Bitcoin and withdraw your funds to the paper wallet. Then start looking to create another account on an other exchange. I can recommend Bitstamp. Here you have the risk that the Bitcoin price could drop and you're losing money.
Or maybe if you have friend which has a verified account and can deposit your tether temporarily.. but that's maybe a pretty bad solution tho. Or ask Kraken if they give you some more time, until you have another full verified account on an other exchange. Hope everything goes well for you!

No, I'm not short sighted.. I just don't see the case that the governments and banks will be like "ok, people are using bitcoin now, let's close our services and adapt to the new system." To make this happening, the 99% of the humans would have to stand together against the 1%, but honestly.. how likely is that?

You can use [LocalBitcoins.com]( or [bitstamp.net]( is a good exchanger. Honestly I'm not sure if the KYC is bannig people under 18.. but otherwise you could maybe open an account through your parents.
Takes a little bit more afford, but imo the best way is to visit blockchain / crypto events, connect to crypto people and build a small network, where you can buy instant small amounts of BTC for cash without fees or premium prices.

Totally agree.. I'm often there and really love the place. Especially the view over the city and the like is amazing. SPA treatments are also a visit worth.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:14:57
But that's honestly necessary for such a huge company.. I mean they can't afford to hold an asset which is volatile as fuck in the hotel industry where you have a lot of expenses to cover in advance etc. 
But as you said: it's a great sign for Bitcoin and the whole crypto market. Galaxus / Digitec was an even bigger surprise for me.. it's the biggest online retailer here.  
So you were recently there? They accept Bitcoin payments from the 1. May.. so I'm really curious how this pilot project will work out within the next weeks / months.
I'm also quite often there because I live near to Zurich &amp; just love the place and view over Zurich. I honestly can't wait to visit it this week to pay with Bitcoin.

Not giving a financial advice here.. but I would buy Monero ($XMR) with those $100 instead of Bitcoin. Just my 2 satoshi.
@_date: 2019-05-06 17:19:20
Yeah, it's a very exclusive hotel and part of the "Swiss Deluxe Hotels" group. So you need a big Bitcoin bag lol

"safe haven hedge for traditional market".. kinda insane that people here still believe that money will flow from a crashing stock market into an unregulated, high volatile market which is dominated by shady exchanges.
Can someone maybe explain me why people believe in this meme? Would really like it to know.

BTC with PayPal with low fees? Difficult.. I used to buy some BTC over PayPal, but the fees were everywhere more or less very very high. In my case I've found some private contacts in my city, which are holding / trading BTC and selling it unofficially without fees. Try to find people in your city which are involved with crypto and ask them. (for example through blockchain / crypto events and meet ups or so)
