I work for Dell (in R&amp;D), we discussed this on an internal site, thinking how awesome it would be... Cannot believe this is actually happening! Go Dell!

Keep in mind that it's not Bitcoin that's the problem, but rather the unfortunate (yet inevitable) growing pains associated with binding BTC to USD (and other currencies). Unfortunately, if everything was instant (without these 'growing pains') people would take advantage of the fact that physical currency payments are reversible and BTC transactions are not.
Sorry for the problems! Just gotta bear it as an early adopter. :-/

Yes, but litecoins are not susceptible to being mined with ASICs, thus you must use GPUs, and thus indirectly makes the mining more decentralized (it's harder to 'cheat' using specialized hardware).

Wow, screw that. If you guys cannot at least keep to option to be anonymous, someone else will do it and beat you guys to the money (pun intended).
Seriously, what the fuck? Palms (my bank doesn't even require that!). ID? This is bullshit. You're making up bullshit. There's NOTHING preventing you from making it easier, like other ATMs around the world.
I hope you go out of business. If there's a way to avoid that (including going out of my way to NOT use BTC ATMS) I WILL.

It is gambling if you're in it for the short term.
