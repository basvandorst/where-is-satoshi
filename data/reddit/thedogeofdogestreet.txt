Hey! Sheeple  here are some interesting facts, **90%** of Tax is utilised for weapons manufacturing, **5%** is stolen by corrupt government officials  and their cohorts to enrich themselves and their nefarious network.
The remaining **5%** is utilised for infrastructure and everything else. 
Subsequently the above is theft, and **no one should comply and pay any tax**, the aforementioned corrupt system is enforced at gunpoint within most jurisdictions around the world.
Therefore one of the main solution's to the above, **buy bitcoin**, and tell the tax man to **GTFO!**

If Tax was allocated in the correct manner, and not 90% utilised on weapons manufacturing, including 5% on corrupt enrichment, you would overstand that, only 5% of the total is actually allocated for infrastructure and everything else.
Quite clearly the above model is unsustainable. but unfourtunatly most **dumb** sheeple believe the BS broadcast by the corrupt broken government and comply. 
The **enlightened**, do not want to participate in the aforementioned debacle, and the remaining **corrupt** few who profit, employ **shills/trolls &amp; neanderthals** to enforce this shite!.

The phrase *"don't run before you can walk"* comes to mind.
Ah! yes the unbanked third world, before we get to them, lets deal with the elephant in the room, the first world use of Bitcoin.
**Firstly**, Bitcoin is global, and does not have an embossed seal *"made in the USA"* stamped on the back of it. The ego's and arrogance from USA and silicon valley in the crypto world is astounding.
**Secondly** Bitcoin is Digital Gold, and lets face facts, the establishments of most world jurisdictions are shit! scared of it, because they know it will dismantle and devalue all their BS fiat currency.
I don't give a fuck about American tax! and neither should american's or any other citizen from any Jurisdiction for that matter. 
Most people in the first world who don't use Bitcoin,  because, ( i ) the price went down below a $1000, ( ii ) they don't want to download the wallet, ( iii ) their scared that their bank might close their account, ( iv ) their slice of the pie in the first world is big enough, so they don't give a shit about bitcoin and will stick with the old corrupt legacy systems. 
As soon as the price goes above $1000 the public will jump aboard again like the greedy sheeple they are.
Ah yes back to the third world, and how to empower them with Bitcoin or any crypto. You have to look at M-PESA for an idea, I don't think bots are on their priority list.

Bitcoin is Digital Gold and one of the top go to safe havens, that's why the corrupt establishments around the world, have pulled out all the stops to discredit it, with their banking shills and paid for propaganda media.

Hey Valentina, thanks for the info, the reason I was asking if you were a solo artist like *Bansky* for example, was due to the fact you use "**We**love the concept and not **I**", that might infer that you are a group of artists working under a consortium.
*Why would that make a difference* you may ask, well I personally don't think *Banksy* and *Warho*l would have been as successful if they were a group of artists attached to one gallery. 
Sorry about the above. I just wanted to clarify the reason for my question lol, I'm guessing that English is not your first language so it was slightly confusing.
I love your chapter road map and concept with Satoshi Gallery, using art to educate the masses with very cool images. 
Like you I suspect...I have also been bitten with the crypto bug ;D), I have pondered with an idea for quite a while, to blend crypto with art which has been very difficult for several reasons, the first I'm not an artist haha, and second I'm not tech savvy or geeky in any way "*doomed from the start*" lol, thirdly as much as I've researched with my laypersons knowledge, the tech has not been fully available or applicable to support my idea.
However, Mone Graph appears to be making forward progress.. 
    
Another interesting project is ..   which is very interesting. I also like   
The above artist seem great, but they're projects only touch upon my idea image wise, maybe I'm bias due to the fact that I'm not a gamer. I'm just an end user really with an idea that requires an artist that is familiar with crypto.
 
To be honest your work is very edgy *banksyish crypto orientated* lol and I like it very much, do you do commissions?.
There are other works in the crypto space that you probably are aware of.
  
In respect of my idea maybe Ethererum might offer the platform tech that I'm looking for only in respect of speed, are you familiar with their wallet or platform?
Cheers for your time ;D)

The European Union ( EU ) dream!, sold as open borders and free flowing trade and partnerships, but in reality a **Euro** ponzi scheme, instigated by the corrupt political elite, AKA money grabbing bastards.
Britain... just a fringe member with their toe in the pool,  retained their sovereign currency the Pound, knowing full well, that the EU zone experiment, would implode after they stole the public wealth.
Of course Cameron and the rest of Cunts lied to the Sheeple about Syria, chanting their favorite mantra  terror!, terror! so they could make even more money off the shares that they hold in weapons manufacturing companies, that they own.
However, when the MP's of both parties voted to bomb the shit out of Syria, against the wishes of the British public with the help of BS! fear mongering, something happened which they didn't account for, **REFUGEES** from Syria flooding the EU. *"Funny isn't it, one minute they are victims, allegedly to be saved from Assad, and as soon as you bomb the fuck out of their habitat, leaving them with nowhere to live, they morph into refugees/terrorists."*
The jingoistic BS! racist fear mongering rhetoric utilised by Cameron and the rest of cunts, to kill &amp; maim for profit, has come back to haunt the British Government.
Britain's an island, and if it remains in the  ( EU ), people will still have the right to travel there, *"remember those people who you just bombed to hell, killing women and children? well Brussels controls Britain's borders."* and that institutionalised  racist fear omelette that's been on the menu can not be undone, the Union Jack is flying full mast.  
The penny has dropped for the sheeple in Britain, Joe Public maybe dumb and part of the heard, but even these thick ignorant sheeple understand that it's time to barricade the front door, after bombing, killing and maiming women and children for profit, because some of those that have fled Syria,.. are pissed off!.
As for Brexit, the Euro is fucked anyway, only the German and French government want that debacle to continue, because they are the main bag-holders of the Euro, Spain, Portugal, Greece are fucked and just like the rest, want out!.
On the bright side, **popcorn** sales have risen in the UK :-) and Bitcoin is wearing it's finest Honey Badger **HODL** coat and is in ascendance.  
The pound ( GBP ) will dip in the short term, to support the corrupt media Brexit fear-mongering propaganda **BS!** however it will miraculously remain stable post Brexit while the Euro will implode, and mirror the Zimbabwean Dollar.  
Update, the Brexit website allegedly crashed last night, denying Joe Public the chance to cast their vote, funny that hrmm, maybe too many want to **vote out!**
In summary once, there is a Brexit, watch the rest of the EU abandon ship, historic days to be in **Bitcoin**.

Britain is only a fringe member of the EU and that was only under the condition that they kept Stirling AKA the Pound, or they would'nt take part in the Nazi Euro ponzi scheme.

The Euro will implode if their is a Brexit, although Britain still utilies stirling. 
Germany and France are the two main players in the Euro debacle, and will be dragged into the subsequent devaluation quagmire post Brexit. 
Greece will implode and Grexit, Portugal will Prexit and abandon ship , followed by Spain and others. Germany and France will become the become the main bag-holders of the Euro.
The only solution to the above will be Bitcoin, and a a fake war directed at refugees/terrorist.

Without you love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning, out of control
So come down and satisfy the need in me
Cos only your good loving can set me free
Don't leave me this way
I don't understand how I'm at your command
So baby please don''t leave me this way
Don't leave me this way
Cos I can't exist
I will surely miss your tender kiss
So don't leave me this way
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
So come on down and do what you've got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning, out of control
So come down and satisfy the need in me
Cos only your good loving can set me free
Don't leave me this way
I can't survive, I can't stay alive
Without you love, oh baby
Don't leave me this way
I can't exist, I will surely miss
Your tender kiss

Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you

The mistaken tactic, of drip fed bad news and fear mongering, hoping this will keep the price down, *big mistake, huge!* 
Ken and barbie doll news presenters of  legacy news stations, with smiling android expressions, playing violins, whilst the good ship **"Fiatanic"** is sinking before their eyes

In layman's terms Gavins' a "cunt", not because he got **allegedly** duped, but all the other dubious BS that he 
has been connected with, who voluntarily agrees to have coffee with the CIA and thinks that's a good idea, there were red flags around him from way back.
Forget marches and protest, that will never work, the voting system is rigged to hell. Anyone who advocates insurrection or change is labeled a terrorist, what is left?
the answer is simple, **Bitcoin**
If **Bitcoin** is the answer, and the cartel of dictators know its' the biggest threat to their demockery they have ever faced, what do you think their response will be knowing their previous world history?
The Bitcoin sub reddit is just the tip of the iceberg, every shill and scum bucket troll from the criminal and financial establishment has been set forth, en masse in r/bitcoin.
Brainy, you lot maybe, but for fuck sake wake up!

Niche, nah! here's why...
When you tell a child **not!** to do something **it!** looks at you, and does it anyway, ....depends if it's then or later.. it's human nature.
When you tell adults **not!** to do something **they!** look at you, and do **it!** anyway, ....depends if it's then or later.... it's human nature. 
That's why I'm bullish on Bitcoin, for every regulation and negative article, a seed of awareness and curiosity is sown.

hrmm.. but you're forgetting one thing, the "value of **Bitcoin**".

Time to book your ticket for a first crack at brute force attacking **fiat legacy Bank Accounts**. IBM gives public access to first quantum computer as cloud service.

One day in the future, when there will be interplanetary transactions, 5 Bitcoin might HODL the equivalent
value of Fort Knox. ;D)

**BBC**  **( British Bullshit Corporation )** The irony,
the most corrupt propagandist mouth piece, of the colonial legacy establishment, pumping out more shit.
Of course all the shills and bankster trolls that infest r/bitcoin, come out *en masse* to promote further FUD and fake discord.

Very good point ;D) **but!** lol.... they may control the house of fiat, however I choose to play poker in crypto.
