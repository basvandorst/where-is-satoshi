Well they could have had a select few with plans to get out rich while  the whole ship go down. Everyone else was unawares possibly even the CEO.

I suggest keeping your BTC but somewhere else than Bitfinex and try diversifying your remaining 2500 into different wallets. It looks like more and more banks are giving in to BTC technology so the coin will only get stronger. Try putting some of your coin into alt coins (less than $100 just to get the hang of it) to see how you can work with the different markets. Research trade costs/gas/ etc to make sure you know when to trade and not lose out on profits. It's much like stock trading but with lower commission fees. Money that you make works for you pays off better than money that is standing still. 
I don't think your bank will give you more than a few pennies a month for your savings. There are better programs for long term savings.

 You're right. I don't think BTC will always be the strongest price-wise, but it's the most predominant and will likely always have a heavy strength in being at least an initial fiat-to-coin trade platform. 
As for cryptocurrency in general, I am almost absolutely certain it will become the dominant form of currency- as for which coin(s) will be used... I believe all and many will fight for viability... just like USD vs YEN vs GBP vs any other countrys' currency. Only now there wont be border restrictions/ tariffs to hold back the average consumer from trading currencies.
I can't tell you which altcoin is better. Nobody is sure. Every coin is improving their technologies, even BTC (since transaction times have slowed down immensely since its inception). But rest assured you should be able to get better gains in coin-trading and savings than you could in stocks/bonds. Just AVOID SCAMCOINS (onecoin) and be aware that obsolete coin technologies will virtually wipe out any outdated coins. 
Invest in the coins with the best security technology/ best transaction times / best user friendliness ... Just like you would decide on a popular stock. 
But again, like stocks, no stock trader has all of their assets in the market. I might save 50% in a CD or other high interest program and play with the other half. Of that remaining 50% I might let 25% go into high risk ventures and the other 25% in safer bluechip ventures. It's really up to you how you want to risk things. They say as you get older you should invest in safer ventures, but as a young person you can afford to take bigger risks. 
Just my opinion. I'm not licenced to give sound financial advice.

It's especially tedious to get everyone in the cafe to look at your money &amp; agree on how much money you are spending.

I think it needs more time for tech to work around the complexity of Bitcoin. Paying for coffee with bitcoin right now feels more like paying for coffee with stock options.

Is this is normal behavior in Estonia?

Somebody just bought all the bitcoins

Wouldn't the vendors be the first one to face charges?
Maybe fining and imprisonment for cryptocurrency isn't being enforced there, like taxes in China.

Can we at least hammer in the simple fact that inflation is the number one reason for collapsing a financial system? (All those history lessons where toilet paper is more expensive than real dollars...)
