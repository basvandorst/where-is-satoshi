Name me a type of currency that's more stable
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:06:11
To be fair, the volatility is a lot less than a few years ago
It's definitely not as stable as most fiat currency though

This is why people are laughing at bitcoin. I like bitcoin but it isn't an end all solution to all problems fiat.

Not going to happen. Like it says in the article there won't be a fork. Just a snapshot being made of the blockchain of BTC for the airdrop of a coin that looks very much like bitcoin

Reading this almost makes me want to buy BCC
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:11:14
I think BCC is probably going to dump hard unless core is not going to allow the 2MB hardfork. In that case we will have a golden opportunity to buy very very cheap btc and bcc
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:12:26
Yeah, not taking the risk :)

Probably went long when he saw the bullish flag, lmao

China is the country where most bitcoin mining happens. Asicboost would centralize mining even more. I can't see how that's a positive development for the bitcoin community

I think we can agree that patents will raise the price of doing business for other miners, while it will generate income for Jihan Wu. following this train of thought, ASICBOOST will give Bitmain a competitive advantage and thus centralize the mining power. I don't really understand what you're trying to say in your second post. ASICBOOST can run covertly, a mining pool has no way to know if a miner is using ASICBOOST...
