For fraud, you need to prove intention. Bad code or defected by design? On the other hand, securities fraud/unregistered sale of securities are completely different concepts. Dont expect any ADA to be very expert with these things. It is not correct to call cryptocurrencies securities per se. It depends on the particular transaction. However, they are accepted as "commodity" by CFTC.  So, when you enter into a contract where you purchase a "commodity" with "future delivery" or no delivery at all, that is a future contract.  This puts many exchanges on the hook as "futures merchants" since they often do not give you your private key, so currently CFTC interprets this as "no delivery," see:  Otherwise you define a security (aka investment contract) by Howey factors (SEC v. W.J. Howey Co.) Coming back to the the question whether cryptocurrency is a security within the meaning of the '33 Act: Under the Howey test, an investment contract is “a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party." Cryptocurrency is IMO no security, since you do not "expect profit solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party."  When you purchase a bitcoin, you do not "invest" in a particular business managed by a group who sold you the cryptocurrency in the first case.  In the context of smart contracts it can get complicated tho. You have to look at the underlying relationship.  If a party to the contract is passive, and basically creates funding to the "manager" of the smart contract, and just waits for revenue to come without performing anything as a party the "smart contract", the smart contract may constitute an "investment contract".
