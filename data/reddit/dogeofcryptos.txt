Dollar probably wont collapse.  Us institutions are generally pretty strong and people follow rules.  Other countries such as those in Latin America have had nunerous banking collapeses

Dont buy the BTC to get B2X.  Spend your money only on the real thing B2X. BTC (Fake scam by developers) B2X legit crypto  like BCH

If you plan on sending your coins, I recommend the ledger.  If not the paper wallet is just fine, if not more secure. As your private keys have not touched the interweb.  You shouldn't put 0 fees.  Your tx may be a permanent member of the mempool (never processed).

But bitcoin's power level is not over 9000
