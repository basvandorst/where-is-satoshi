If you want to establish a system of fractional reserve banking, you need some regulations put in place.  I assume this is where Libra is eventually going if they expect to launch a facebook+venmo type of offering.
Would Tether, for example, benefit from some better auditing/regulation/transparency?  If we found out tomorrow that there was only 1 USD for every 10 USDT, it could crash the crypto market overnight.

It took a good 4-5 attempts before my wife accepted what had happened.  
"What do you mean--we just get more money?"
"So what happens to the bitcoin?"
"Why are people buying it?"
"Wait, what's a blockchain?"
"Ok, when is the next hardfork so we can do this again?"
At one point she also asked why I don't fork bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:13:14
Because it is the only true bitcoin that follows the whitepaper!  How else could you call yourself bitcoin and ever add features or grow a technology?  Segwit is apparently the devil as well.
I brought up why they aren't already the dominant p2p cash system, since there is no changes necessary to make that possible.  Also why they want value to increase, since being used as cash would benefit from having a near flat exchange rate with fiat.  Strangely I didn't get a lot of well-reasoned responses.

Whatever you want. The point is to always try to be growing and learning new things. 
Early in your career max out your 401k at least to get the full company match. This is literally free money and will grow like crazy by retirement if you're in your 20s. Invest in low management fee index funds. Do a mix of small, mid, large cap stocks and possibly an international fund if fee is low. Early in career target one of the funds that is an aggressive growth stock fund, normally with more tech companies involved. Again, low fees. Set an even allocation across all 4 or 5 funds you choose. 
As your portfolio grows, look at how you are balanced overall and make sure it still lines up with your risk goals. If you start with 5% of your portfolio in crypto, then that grows to 90% of your portfolio, that probably doesnt match up with the reasons you only did 5% in the first place. 
Don't buy things you can't afford. Don't use a credit card unless you are paying it off monthly. This especially goes for eating and drinking out. If you can't afford it, do it infrequently.

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:27:40
Segwit was the fork to make lightning network possible.  Any additional hard forks would be to increase block size after lighting network is solidified.  With a layer 2 scaling solution, any blocksize increase can exponentially increase the transaction capability instead of increasing it linearly.
How large would the blocksize need to be to handle Visa/MC peak transaction volume?  How much bandwidth would be required every 10 minutes and how much would the blockchain grow every month/year?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:39:11
You're misunderstanding him. He literally links directly to the article from coinbase stating that the money is FDIC insured custodial accounts and does not belong to coinbase.
Coinbase is not the one holding FDIC insurance. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:50:08
Again, opening and closing payment channels always requires on-chain transactions.  There will eventually not be enough room in a 1MB block with segwit to handle this transaction volume, leading to centralization.  Users will turn to centralized payment processors where they keep their crypto, and merchants will open payment channels with these payment processors as well.
The big difference with a future blocksize increase once LN is mainstream is that the transaction volume scales exponentially, not linearly.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:05:38
I liken it to IPv4 and IPv6. We've been running out of IPs for a long time, and I think most blocks are already allocated at this point. We have a solution developed with IPv6 but it is taking a *really* long time to get widespread adoption.
Now imagine that you instead decided to add another octet to ipv4 instead of rolling out IPv6, and everyone had to coordinate switching over to the new protocol at the same time or else they can't access any services that have switched over.  Then put billions of dollars on the line as well. That is what people are asking for with a hard fork--it's easy for bitcoin cash to increase the block size because they are starting "fresh". A hard fork to bitcoin is inherently dangerous. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:44:39
With current adoption segwit txs are dirt cheap.  What about if adoption increases to billions of users?  There will not be room in the blockchain for users to open payment channels.
Proposing use of exchanges to solve the problem is suggesting that centralization is the solution because ordinary users will not want to pay on-chain fees themselves.  How is that a solution?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:46:37
Who are you to decide what is waste and what is not?  They are paying the fees, not you.  If they can afford the fees, they have every right to transact on-chain with non-segwit transactions.

It needs both.  Opening (and closing) a lightning payment channel will still require two transactions on-chain.  If those transactions cost $30+ each, it will disincentivize people to use bitcoin.

He is referring to a mass exodus of hashrate after a difficulty adjustment. If significant mining hashrate left btc, block confirmations would take a lot longer than 10 minutes in an already congested network. This would further devalue bitcoin and remove even more incentive for miners to commit their hashrate. 
This happened to namecoin back in the day when it was temporarily more profitable to mine than bitcoin. Once difficulty adjustment kicked in, it was basically unusable until dual mining came out.

It can effectively transition bitcoin into a proof of stake system. You could open payment channels with merchants and charge a fee for transacting with your coins. As long as your fees cover the fees to transact on-chain to open/close the channel, you're making money. 
If seems likely that major players like coinbase will function as a central clearing house. Other merchants as well as users could keep paymenf channels open with these clearing houses to process transactions efficiently between users. 
I could also see it being a new form of store credit card, but preloaded into a payment channel. This would get you premium promotions from the merchants, just like today's store cards. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:15:59

@_date: 2017-12-20 21:32:58
A fine idea in theory, but what would likely end up happening instead is:
You propose a change like forcing segwit at block  and make sure it's clear that its a hard fork
Many of the users update their nodes and wallets to support the new fork
The merchants who don't want to support the fork don't.  
The fork happens, and congratulations you've just created another bitcoin altcoin, only since it was not an intentional contentious hardfork you haven't put in replay protection and no exchange is willing to use it later on.  Your users who have updated wallets are attempting to use bitcoin with their exchanges but they aren't transacting on the same chain, so coins are 'lost' unless they use a wallet without the change.  Exchanges that *did* implement the change are transacting as normal, and both chains are growing independently, further diving what was BTC.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:47
Lightning still requires on-chain transactions.  The benefit is that block-size increases have an exponential increase in tx/sec due to off-chain scaling.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:15:39
If 90% of merchants don't want to 'get with the game' then you don't have consensus and will be creating further division of BTC and erosion of trust.  You can't 'force' anyone to do something.

Then you're in agreement with what I stated?  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:45:45
assuming we are referring to just segwit vs non-segwit:
What if it cost Coinbase $1MM to implement segwit for their platform.  What if it was $10MM.  Perhaps they would recover those costs from their increased user-base, perhaps not.  Should they be forced to incur costs to implement changes that are not in their best financial interests?  That is the whole point of a soft-fork--it's the choice of the user if they want to leverage the new functionality.  If users choose to leave coinbase because of lack of segwit that is their choice as well.  To many of the new users, unfortunately coinbase==bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:58
That is only true if lightning network were usable today.  As adoption increases there will be a corresponding increase in on-chain transactions.  Even if everyone used a central clearing house for payment channels (effectively recreating visa/mc in our decentralized 'paradise') it would still require two transactions per user.
We are creating a bitcoin in which users will be forced to use online wallets and commercial payment processors because they can't afford to transact on the blockchain themselves.

Only keep daily spending BTC in an online wallet like coinbase--an amount that you are comfortable losing.
Use one or more hardware wallets to store the rest of the coins.  Your recovery seed (24 word 'phrase' used when you set up your wallet) is as good as the private keys, so keep this as safe as you would $30k cash.  
Advantages of someone local is you can buy coins immediately with cash.  Disadvantages is you have someone who can stab you immediately for cash.  You'd want to spread out multiple purchases from different sellers for around 1BTC or so if you're meeting them in person with cash.  
TL;DR - Coinbase is fine for buying, but use one or more hardware wallets where you're familiar with the recovery process for long term storage.

I'm not disagreeing with you.  The risk of an exchange (yes even the highly praised Coinbase) being hacked is very real and happened multiple times to the tune of almost a half billion dollars.  The risk of an inexperienced user screwing up and losing their coins is also very real and the bitcointalk forums are full of countless examples (i personally have a friend who lost [current day] 8-figures USD worth).  
Educating users on the risks of both is the best course of action to allow them to decide which is more likely for themselves.

@_date: 2016-12-23 02:56:25
When you initialize it, you enter a seed which is 12, 18, or 24 word pass phrase.  
This pass phrase generates your private key which is stored encrypted (with your own encryption passphrase) on the device and (based on manufacturer specs) cannot be retrieved.
Your device is protected with a PIN which is used when you plug the device into a computer to allow it to sign transactions with your private key and access the associated coins.  They have a clever way of entering PIN on the computer which renders a keylogger useless without seeing an image presented on the trezor at the time the PIN is entered.
In short, you can send coins to your public addresses without any issue, but sending coins using your private key requires the device and its PIN to work.  If the device is lost, your passphrase seed can be imported into a new hardware or software wallet to recover the private key.

Do not move your coins right now. You will still be able to use them. 
Your wallet has private keys that control your coins on the bitcoin block chain. The bitcoin block chain is being intentionally split into a alternative crypto currency called Bitcoin Cash (BCH). 
When this happens, both chains exist and carry on as long as miners continue to confirm transactions on them. This means that your same private keys will control coins on both bitcoin blockchain (BTC) as well as the new altcoin BitcoinCash (BCH). 
When the dust settles you can follow guides on transferring your existing BTC to a new wallet (so you have new BTC private keys) then import your old private keys into a BCH wallet so you can spend the BCH or send them to a new BCH wallet. 
Tl;Dr - your coins are safe if you control the private keys. Avoid doing anything with them right now if you can. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 02:44:08
I'm not usually one to agree with something pedantic, but in this case it's an important distinction.  
A newbie might say "omg but what if you lose it" or not understand the importance of protecting their seed if they think a hardware wallet stores the coins itself.

Quarterly password rotations are a *bitch* though
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:30:32
Correct, but the chances of that happening are basically non-existent. 
The majority of miners do pool mining, where they are submitting work along with other miners to a single pool. When the pool finds a block, they distribute the reward based on number of shares submitted. This slight reduces profit (since the pool takes a cut) but greatly reduces volatility. 
Regardless, CPU mining has not been profitable for 5-6 years. GPU mining (using a high end graphics card) has been obsolete for 3-4 years. Unless you have free power, you won't be profitable doing any kind of mining without an ASIC.

Mining BTC can be profitable for individuals if you buy latest gen ASICs when they are released and have access to free or cheap power.
Mining alternative cryptos can be done on CPUs or GPUs depending on their POW algorithm and is quite a bit of fun.  Start by picking a crypto that is CPU-mining friendly and get a feel for it.  If you still like it, try to find some good GPUs and get started mining some more mainstream cryptos.

A fork has the benefit of an existing user base who will all have an equal number of coins on the new chain. 
The point though is that bitcoin has the merchant adoption and broad support a cryptocurrency needs, but isn't able to keep up with demand. I say all of this as a hodler since 2011 who has already dumped the majority of my BCH. I'm long BTC but hope something is done before more users get frustrated with high TX fees and wait times.

Malicious actors have just as much of a right to the blockchain as you or I do. You don't get to decide which transactions are valid or invalid--miners determine that, and prioritize based on fees. 
Bad actors may be attempting to highlight the fact that bitcoin cannot keep up with current transaction load (by exacerbating the problem), and they are correct. Blocks have been full since before this 'attack' began and they will be full afterwards. 
Bitcoin does not have a completed solution to the scaling problem. Bigger blocks do not fix it, nor does segwit. Until it is fixed, critics will continue to bring it up and rightfully so. There is a long road ahead of us and core is being appropriately cautious to avoid problems down the road.

They could eventually crack all in-use cryptography, not just the algorithms used by bitcoin.  Increase in CPU processing power is usually met with stronger and more complex algorithms which are less susceptible to brute forcing.  The keylength used in some of these algorithms is already beyond what may be possible to bruteforce, even with a future quantum computer.
Quantum computers are, however, a bit different in that they are an evolutionary leap in technology resulting in exponentially more 'power'.  Commercial models are *just* becoming available, and are more of a proof of concept than a viable machine.  I think first IBM model is only 20 qubits compared with hundreds of millions of transistors in a modern CPU.  Transistors are the 0 and 1s of a computer, whereas a quantum computer's qubit can store a larger number of states (definitely more than 2).  
So yes, it may be possible to crack current algorithms with future quantum computers, but the algorithms and keylengths would change to stay resistant to these attacks.  This could result in future hardforks of Bitcoin which may further subdivide the crypto space.

The point of a replay attack is that any transaction you make on chain A can be replayed on chain B.
If I sell someone on localbitcoins 10 B2X coins, they can take that same transaction and replay it on the BTC chain and take those coins as well. The signatures for the transactions are identical so it looks like my private key meant to sign a transaction on both chains. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:10:34
Miners are responsible for verifying the transactions which will be included in a block, so that someone can't double spend coins.
Miners also have to complete a complex math problem, referred to as a one-way hash. The only way to solve the problem is random attempts, since you can't deterministicly predict the 'solution' to a one way hash based on the inputs. 
The first miner who solves the hash problem 'wins' the block, and gets the 12.5BTC reward (the only source of *new* bitcoin) as well as all the fees from the transactions they have verified and included in the the block. Because of this incentive, specialized hardware has been created with chips capable of attempting billions of these solutions per second.
Since electrical power is the limited resource, the counties with access to the cheapest power contain the majority of hash power, effectively centralizing a key element of the bitcoin network.

If there is a fork to a new chain you'll own the same number of coins there as you do on the bitcoin chain.

I'm guessing the grafana/graphite box is running windows, but hopefully your mining rigs are on linux.
Check out netdata--it likely already has a collector for GPU temps, and will grab all your other system vitals.  It's set up to just display recent data locally via self-hosted webpage, but you can use it to feed influxDB instead.  
If it can't send graphite format directly, use telegraf agent to transform from InfluxDB via HTTP input plugin to graphite output plugin.  
You could also just run telegraf directly on the mining rigs and have it run a script to collect the temp/hashrate data and send it off to graphite.  Don't reinvent the wheel :)

From a security perspective it's not much different from what you're doing now. 
Get a wallet like Trevor. When you go to generate private keys, it will walk you through presentation of 24 Word seed phrase on the device. You write these down on an included piece of paper in order (or print them through your offline Ubuntu process). These words are used to generate the private keys which are never available to you from the trezor. 
The only way to get the private keys is to use your seed words to re-generate the keys using the BIP specification or an online or offline software wallet. 
You can secure the trezor with a 6 digit passcode that is required to sign transactions if you plan on sending the coins anywhere. 
You can also store an encrypted wallet of sorts in the trezor that can be hidden, and have a separate wallet with a small balance that you can reveal under duress. If you encrypt the primary wallet then this encryption phrase is needed to recover private keys along with seed phrase. 
Best solution for hw wallet imo is encrypted and passcode protected trezor, with seed phrase on crypto steel in safe deposit box or similar secure storage. 
I don't see any reason to change from your current method unless you want to have the ability to send coins without sweeping an entire paper wallet.

Yes this is the signature of the transaction/message.  It is a one way hash that is encrypted, so that the signature can be verified by the public key.  In the case of bitcoin, the bitcoin addresses themselves are essentially hashed public keys so they can be used to directly verify messages signed with their private keys.


This is up to the wallet/client to implement, but many of them now have a 'sign message' or 'verify message' feature.
I have only done it from the trezor wallet, but I'm pretty sure Bitcoin core has implemented it in gui (where previously it was only through CLI).  
There are also online tools to verify messages if it's not a feature of your wallet.  In this case, you can use a tool like the one on bitcoin.com to verify a message
You put in the address
    14ULrrVJ2pVFkdRxq4kScBD5yjiMMbmd4h
And the message
    I am assaf_assaf and on 30/5/2017 i did offer $30,000 to block ASICBOOST.
And finally the signature 
   
    IBaGNF+tyhF4vHK3kUkGCJauyVxCp/nXWIu3xp74/WZUPVwoMpvXEWuGjQbDqXrrLLJZB5SvQudH8c/Vh8iETeQ=
Changing even one character of the message drastically alters the resulting hash so someone cannot change the message and still use the same signature.

Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) work through pairs of public and private keys. 
You can use your private key (that only you should ever have) and sign a message. This message can be verified by anyone that has your public key(s). This is how you spend money on the block chain--you sign a message spending coins from an address that was generated from your keys. 
*I have not personally verified the message but I'm assuming the two others who responded have*
In this case a message was signed using a private key that had access to an address containing 25BTC, proving that the user has the bitcoin to back up their claims. 
This is why no one else can claim to be Satoshi Nakamoto, creator of bitcoin. Anyone who claims to be satoshi would be able to sign a message using keys that are publicly known to belong to satoshi. Either it has to be him, or they impersonated him using a $5 wrench.

@_date: 2017-06-05 18:32:29
Yes you will have coins in both chains.  You need to be careful at that point because if you spend coins on one chain it could be replayed on the other chain as well.
Example:  You meet up with someone on localbitcoins and agree to sell him one BTC for the current market price.  He buys the coin, then goes home and broadcasts your transaction on the other chain, meaning he receives your coins on both chains for one low low price.

Regardless of his opinion in the matter, he stated unbiased facts about the current state of UASF through BIP148.  If you disagree with something he said, express your differing viewpoint instead of resorting to ad hominem attacks.
In contrast, you referred to a 'large group' of users without even stating a percentage represented or if it was majority consensus.  You also referred to a miners as 'malicious' for maintaining the status quo and looking out for their own best interest.
The simple fact of the matter is that users need miners and miners need users.  Miners will act in their own best interest and so will users.  Compromise will be required for either party to get something they want, and both will likely have to concede on something they didn't want.

The core devs have been safely maintaining bitcoin since its inception and are nothing close to 'beginners'. They may not be moving as fast as some people would like but it doesn't mean they are being irresponsible--it's quite the opposite. 
Bitcoin works on consensus, and we don't have it right now. In the absence of consensus the only other option is a fork. The devs are working to determine correct long term solutions to the scaling problem as well as short term fixes. Segwit has been possible for a while but there is not hash rate consensus that agrees that it should be the standard. 
We're in a rough situation right now but rushed decisions that alienate the miners who support the network could be catastrophic.

It's not even clear that bitcoin miners would be considered transmitters in this case.  This was written for virtual currencies in general, not bitcoin.  
It is unlikely that someone would succeed in court arguing that miners are not 'creating' currency, but the argument can certainly be made.  What it boils down to, is that miners are doing work to support the virtual currency, and receiving coins that were previously not in circulation.  They are certainly 'creating' the coins following the spirit of the FinCEN document.  
No big deal.  Trade BTC for LTC (or whatever other competing currency you choose), then trade LTC for USD.  Problem solved.
The most important part of that document, and something that is actually a huge benefit of it, is that **USERS** of bitcoins are not controlled at all.

Bitcoin is designed as a deflationary currency that will only ever release 21M bitcoins total.  
In order to make a change to this, the devs would have to make a change to software and the majority of the network would have to accept this change (start using the new client) which (I think) would cause an intentional fork.  There is almost no chance of this happening without malicious intervention from a *very* large entity capable of taking 51%.
I'm pretty sure thats how it works, but someone can correct me if I'm wrong

I know yesterday I saw the v2 API remain functional as the main site and v1 API were occasionaly unavailable

The issue if that your private key and addresses are the same on both chains. If you have a signed transaction on one chain, it can be replayed on the other chain with the same results. 
For example if I buy 5 BTC off you then I can take that transaction and force the network on the other chain to send me the coins there as well. 
It's important to take steps to mitigate this in the event of a permanent chain split. If the permanence is unclear, avoid conducting transactions unless you understand the implications.

CRT Monitors and dial-up modems can still have utility.  Mining ASICs are worthless if mining no longer exists.

Miners do work to support the network, the network creates coins, the miners receive these coins for supporting the network.  Good luck arguing otherwise in court ;)
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:19:16
Yeah I saw the same.  Pretty unlikely they actually got 300gbps

You will never find a block on your own.  It's probably not even worth your time to mine at 20MH/s.  If you still want to mine, join a pool.

I'd say it would be wise to sell something and take half the earnings and pay off debt, or put it in a cash savings account.  Bitcoin is the last thing I'd recommend to you in your situation.

Depends on where it ends up :)

$10 shipping?  For a giftcard? 
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:18:14
This.  Much less than 2 weeks if they ship them quickly.

MtGox has it at 180 with 90 seconds of trading lag.  Thats only about a 25% dip.  It dipped to &lt;50% but recovered.
@_date: 2013-02-24 03:08:34
You also lower the risk until you lose more bitcoin.

Please point me to the service where I can reliably and instantly convert my bitcoins to cash.

Looks like its a javascript issue, not a password issue.  Password was generated with lastpass so I never actually typed a character into the field.  
Also, am I missing something or is there nowhere to change your password on the site?  Might want to add that in...

"Common Users"
We're aware that *you* could probably come up with alternatives that combine 4-5 pieces of hardware/software at less than the cost of the Trezor.  Some people would rather pay an extra $100 to avoid all that trouble.

MtGox just crashed.  They are nearly at the point where they can't continue trading.
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:18:25
In the short term, price will likely be affected.  Sharp increase in hashing --&gt; increase in rate of blocks being solved --&gt; more bitcoins.  Many of these early blocks will be solved by people with new equipment they want to pay off, so they will likely be selling the BTC rather than holding.

It's more like they are sitting in front of a door to a safe.  There are many doors to the same safe like it, but that one is theirs.
They're going to finally get the safe open (but nah) and realize he emptied the contents months before through another door...
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:43:18
They own and operate their own ASICs for shareholders .  No reason to believe they'd fake this.
@_date: 2013-05-09 19:27:34
You're kind of being a douche.  This enormously improves the utility of bitcoins.  
If you had 
1) a completely empty bank account 
2) 50,000 bitcoins
3) A verified MtGOX account
4) $0.00 in fiat
How quickly could you cash out and buy a meal tonight?  Without meeting someone in person to sell bitcoins for cash you're pretty much out of luck. 
This is yet another option to use bitcoins to buy real world goods quickly, and do it all from your smartphone.
It's slick and easy.
@_date: 2013-03-19 04:26:43
So mine for BTC, exchange for LTC, then sell LTC for fiat?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:49:12
Now *that* would be the life :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:43:27
At a site like MtGOX, the DDOS is caused by the trading itself.  It's not a typical DDOS that you'd see against a site like bitcointalk.
I would guess that MtGOX was the target, and the other sites are being unintentionally DDOSed by normal users hitting f5 every 3 seconds to see where the price went.
Gox lag is still increasing

And if it was a 99% crash it would be $2.20!  Math is sweet

Agreed, but more and more ASICs will be shipped in the near future.  It will be like the GPU race where difficulty was increasing in less than a week and BTC supply was increased as a result.  It will not stabilize until ASICs have saturated the market and breakeven point to pay them off is 10-12 months, dissuading casual miners.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:39:44
They probably only had a gigabit uplink, which was 99.7% saturated

tl;dr -- Bitcoin is used for some bad stuff but we're really awesome at our jobs.  Bad guys don't stand a chance.

Just tried it out.  Withdrew 1BTC from MtGOX to Coingator address.
Confirmed in 1 transaction and paid to my paypal
@_date: 2013-07-05 16:30:28
Sold them both for 8k total on eBay =/  Soooooo, I guess it went pretty well (except for losing about 10% due to eBay and paypal fees!)

The public IP should never have be configured on the webserver.  *THAT* is the misconfiguration.

We are still in the midst of a speculative bubble.  The rapid recovery after dips is expected until the bubble pops.
The current economy for bitcoin does not support a price well above $30.  The future economy probably does.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:17:41
It's probably just above average demand, not an intentional DDOS.

I had a 16-character password w/ all 4 groups covered.  It still said it could be cracked in less than 1 second, but both password fields and that text was red.  Kind of weird...
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:12:36
It could also pop down to $60, then $30, then $10 and never recover.
