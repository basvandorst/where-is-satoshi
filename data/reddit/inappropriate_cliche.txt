Nice graphics, but can we leave this poor man alone?

Creating coins, and all mining in general, is all consensus based -- you essentially have to get a majority of miners to agree with you that your coins are valid.  All miners have agreed that the only way you can create coins is if you find a block.  If you tried to create coins for yourself miners would invalidate and ignore the transaction.

A million people creating a million addresses a day is only a number with 13 digits.  There are 2^160 addresses, which is a decimal number 49 digits long.  You still wouldn't be close if that were happening on a million billion planets simultaneously.  Aside from the 2^160 addresses, there are 2^256 private keys and the size of that number is demonstrated in [this popular infographic.](

There is currently an incentive for miners to keep blocks small, because smaller found blocks can be transmitted around the network faster than large blocks, thus increasing the chance a miner can claim the prize for their found block.  Gavin's solution would make all found block announcements a fixed-size blob, removing the small-size incentive.  This in turn would likely mean miners would want to include more transactions in their blocks to collect more transaction fees.

And where do the coins they're selling come from?  They're bought on exchanges by their customers.

When I swipe my credit card at the store, I have to hope the store's payment terminals haven't been hacked and my identify won't be sold in a Russian hacker forum.  That's what trust looks like.

You must be confused.  There were not wheelbarrow-full-of-cash bread prices in the Great Depression.

Which part?  It's hard to explain the hashing without a scary wall of text... Hash functions just create a unique random binary output for every input, and in our case the input is your txid+secret.  We grab 1 unique digit for every digit you played from the end of the hash.  Depending on the game you played, prizes are awarded if you match 0 digits, 1 digit, 2 digits, etc.

MySQL was recently discovered to have had a problem with password validation.  People were looking at that code for years, and the flaw was only discovered accidentally.  I'm sure Bitcoin is a vastly smaller codebase but there's almost always unexpected behavior in code.

Yep, the prizes are scaled differently in versions A, B, and C of each game.  You choose whether you want a bigger multiplier more often or a huge prize less often.

this is the great thing about bitcoin.  if you care to, you can store your money where nobody else in the world can get to it.  not governments, thieves, corporations, etc.  you have to roll dice and memorize 12 words though.  
  
or you can trust the seed the computer generates for you.  or you can trust a wallet service like coinbase.  or you can not use bitcoin at all.  it's all up to you.

You can roll a 6-sided die 50 times, put the string of 50 1s-6s into a hash function, and then copy the first 32 hex characters into electrum "restore from seed" -- electrum will show you the equivalent 12-word seed for backups.

keep those satoshis safe.  when bitcoins are worth $1M apiece, you can buy yourself a second condo or a ferrari.

mining is what "lock down" past transactions so they can't be messed with.  miners will continue to collect transaction fees at that point.
@_date: 2013-11-21 02:41:52
Yep just an elaborate way to say "no."
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:59:52
$2 globally, per transaction? or per block (or per 6 blocks)?
i think the costs will balance themselves out -- if it's too expensive to run mining hardware, people will turn off their hardware which will decrease the difficulty.  if mining is relatively cheap, more people will mine and the difficulty will then increase.

I think this will be how the majority of everyday users of bitcoin will eventually store the bulk of their savings.  Once the adoption rate tops out and the value of a bitcoin is going up steadily (say 2%/year, slow deflation) you'll just have to pay some percentage of your coins (say 0.5%/year) as the insurance premium.  The incentive will be on the company to not lose your coins, as it is their loss.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:34:47
historically, price has increased with mining difficulty.  also, i don't know what you mean by "supply life" but the difficulty will scale to ensure bitcoins will be mined at the prescribed rate.
@_date: 2013-01-03 21:27:28
well, yes.  if you play long enough, you're going to lose many times in a row, which will drive up that "coins bet" number.
the 98% applies only if you play X number of times, and then never again.
@_date: 2013-01-03 03:02:41
People play, win a little, and so are motivated to continue to play until they have no coins left.  It's human nature and that's why their profit is higher than you'd expect.

except bitcoin is far from the first virtual currency.  the satoshi bitcoin whitepaper was released shortly after QQ was shut down in China.  there were also liberty reserve and e-gold.  bitcoin itself is still on version 0.8.

Aside from knowledge you also need the funds to pay prizes.
