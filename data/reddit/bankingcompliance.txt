You're confusing demand capital ratios that banks are required to maintain, for liquidity purposes, to backstop outstanding loans (ergo potential losses) and other financial obligations with "printing money".  They are 2 entirely separate issues.  Only central banks, literally, print money.

WTF does this ignorant luddite skateboarder have to offer?  Nothing.
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:29:45
Another ironic comment from an unemployed gamer douche bag.
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:33:42
Clearly, you're an idiot.

He's the same clown who invested in Theranos and doubled down on his support after the investigations and indictments.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:53:23
Correct on both assertions.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:11:31
Yes, I did.  More than 8 years ago. You wear your ass like a well fitted hat.
@_date: 2019-10-30 05:33:41
You are truly dumber than a fence post.

You're the literal embodiment of Bill Murray's quote: 
"It’s hard to win an argument with a smart person, but it’s damn near impossible to win an argument with a stupid person."
@_date: 2019-10-29 15:44:43
Um, because you are and fiscally illiterate.
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:07:07
Nice tinfoil hat.

PS:  "empirically".  And, they're wrong.  Whenever a clown believes their religious beliefs are relevant to "science", they're truly delusional.  Economics is a "soft science" and isn't a science by any stretch of the imagination.   Grow up.   Only central banks print money.  You really have no idea WTF you're talking about.

I license my IP in payments, machine learning and AI to fortune 100 companies.  The cost, per BTC, was far lower then.  I knew the risk was low and the math on the audit trail was brilliant and bullet proof.  Stick to video games and masturbation, as they're more your speed.
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:15:06
There there, honey.  Go back to bed.  You change your urine soaked sheets in the morning after cereal and cartoons.  You're just another unemployed douche masturbating in his mommies basement to video games.  :)

Yes, it was.  He was/is a family friend and ignored the warning signs.   Elizabeth Holmes grew up with his daughter.

Banks don't print money, CENTRAL banks print money.  i.e. The Bank of England, the US Federal Reserve, The European Central Bank, etc.
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:22:14
Ironic comment is ironic.  Enjoy poverty and hell, douche bag.
@_date: 2019-08-22 00:41:36
It's HIGHLY speculative and subject to massive swings in valuation.  This is a fact that is inescapable.  I wouldn't expect anyone who doesn't under finance, statistics and mathematics to comprehend this.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:54:31
I already made that comment, you delusional, irrational, uneducated, ridiculous half-wit.  You wear your ass like a well-fitted hat.
@_date: 2019-10-29 18:58:29
You're utterly clueless and have no idea HTF a central banking system (i.e. The Federal Reserve) works and how banks function within the chain.  Commercial banks borrow from the Federal Reserve primarily to meet reserve requirements when their cash on hand is low before the close of the business day. To put themselves back over the minimum reserve threshold, a bank borrows money from the government's central bank utilizing what is known as the discount window.  So, kindly STFU until and unless you know WTF you're talking about.  ONLY the Federal Reserve may print money in a literal and figurative sense.  All commercial banks must adhere to demand deposit capital ratios on loans outstanding AND THEY FUCKING CAN'T PRINT MONEY.

You don't double down in support of a complete fraud unless you're an idiot.  I know Tim and his best days are 10 years ago.
@_date: 2019-10-12 16:05:25
They have some but they're not so stupid as to publicly support a massive fraud and continue their support.  It's ridiculous and demonstrates how little you know and that you have no investments or assets.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:57:52
No doubt about it.  Particularly, from someone like you with no education and a manual labor job.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:38:07
1 year does not an investment make.  Just ask those who invested in the "VIX".
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:10:04
Being a scientist does.  Unlike you I am a scientist and the claims and assertions theranos made with their "perpetual motion machine" were easily discounted by any scientist worth their salt.  We knew it was a fraud from day one as ALL FUCKING VALID SCIENCE REQUIRES PEER REVIEW coupled with extensive testing, analysis of the raw data and the availability of the technology for verification and validation.  None of which was done.  NO FUCKING 1ST YEAR BIOLOGY dropout would've had the knowledge base to invent what she claimed.  Jesus fuck, grow up.
Edit:  Software development is much different than hard sciences (biology, chemistry, physics, etc) which require a degree of training and sufficient education to acquire the knowledge base to be innovative.  None of which she had.
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:18:52
And you're still one of those religious, survivalist, conspiracy theorist morons.
@_date: 2018-11-24 16:59:00
Ironic comment from the investor who still thinks Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos didn't commit securities fraud.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:51:30
HTF would you know.  Facepalm.
