I used bitfest a couple of days ago and I got my Ps3 today. Great service.

I have a 5770 mining at 220 megahashes a second and two 6950 mining in in the other computer. I use guiminer(its very easy to use) and I get 0.47 bit coins every 24 hours.

The best i have got from the fat 60gb ps3 is just over 26mh/s that is just with the 7th spu enabled and both ppe cores. It uses 120watt of power. I set it up as a test and it did get quite toasty. It isn't financially viable to do it (unless you have free electric).

I had 40 bitcoin, I lost some on MtGox,  I stupidly sold some on ebay and got charge backs. I sold 3 and got a AMD Radeon HD 7990. I sold 6 and brought a Mitsubishi GTO and spend another 4 doing it up. I now have 2 left.... and a GTO

1. No because it is different users buying and selling on different exchanges.
2. With fees it would be hard to make a profit to buy/sell/movie the coins across.
3. It was being DDOS'ed and it caused quite a bit of lag and a lot of users couldn't make transactions when it was important to.
4. I like to believe they will.
