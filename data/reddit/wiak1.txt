Same here, bought ten more at around $35.  That's about where the price was earlier this week before it went all parabolic on us.

The buy orders are already placed, people are selling their coins into them.

.04 is a little high for this week, I'd say around .025 again with larger (.035+) next week after strong blade sales.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:36:15
BTCchina is still at $275.  Don't panic, just hold and let the lag work itself out of Mt Gox, then the buyers will jump back in!

The vast majority of people on right now are speculators who just want a quick buck.  Wait til after the crash and intelligent discussion will resume.
@_date: 2013-03-28 14:40:14
My guess is because they don't know how/don't want to wait for verification or a bank transfer at many of the exchanges and are willing to pay a premium to use paypal.  The sellers are also taking on the risk of chargebacks.

As I said in the thread, the problem is not for Americans who know the current time.  The problem was for non-Americans who googled the time to convert it to their local time, not realizing the difference between CST and CDT.  I saw this error and informed TheSwede, who works with Labcoin and he said he would tell Burnside.
The fact is a time was posted and then not honored.  This reflects poorly on Burnside to admit his error and then do nothing to rectify the mistake.

And the consistently ~5000 users that have been here all day.  This craziness will get sorted out and the market will be better for it.

Is there a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol? No.  Then I continue buying.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:14:53
I believe a combination of all of those.  Mt Gox's trading engine is also not built well to handle these volumes.  They addressed it [here last week]( after last week's DDOS correction.

Still around fifteen minutes of lag.  Buyers will wait til the lag drops and then jump back in.

Depends on how long it takes the lag to work itself out.  Right now we're still at around twenty minutes of lag.

It's not super easy to get your money in/out of there (time and fees), that's why not many people arbitage.  They have usually been a good indicator of where the market is headed, however, especially since they are not suffering from the lag/DDOS that other exchanges are right now.

Same thing here, went from 10 btc to 1, but it still shows their purchase in the transaction log.  Sent them an email, but from what I have read on this subreddit, it sounds like they will go above and beyond to make it right (throwing in an extra bitcoin when they mess up, or paying an overdraft fee).  Either way, they need to get it together over there.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:20:04
Like I said yesterday: Is there a flaw in the Bitcoin protocol? No, so I hold. 
Added a few coins to my wallet over the last day, for those of us in long term this is like a fire sale! :D

It's fun right when the lag drops to near zero the buy orders flood in and the price rebounds in minutes.  Everyone's just waiting for the lag to drop down to jump back in!
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:19:15
Mt Gox is incredibly laggy, and price manipulators like to use that to cause these panics about once a week.  Their trading engine process the sell orders, lags out, new investors/weak hands see the price dropping and panic sell.  A lot of people are also trying to buy in, but their orders don't get processed quickly because of the lag.  The buyers hold off because they'd basically be putting in a market order at an unknown price. Eventually it sorts itself out, sellers lose money, buyers get cheap coins, and the price continues to rise for about another week, til it all happens again.
Personally, I feel this is useful to "deflate" the market and avoid any large scale crash by weeding out the weaker hands that are likely to panic sell at any drop in price.

Just some weak hands jumping ship, same as last week's correction.  This is a great chance to buy because it'll probably pop right back up above 90 once gox stops lagging out.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:56:15
Anyone selling Bitcoins for $200 below market value is definitely a scam.

@_date: 2013-03-28 21:03:37
Love it! It dips down for a half hour, and then the flood of buyers catches up with the gox lag and the price bounces right back up to where it was.  This is why I think this is not a bubble, this has happened five or six times in the past month.
@_date: 2013-07-07 01:11:50
I believe it was hacked early on, and something like billions of bitcoins were created before the client was patched .  On my phone, so don't have the source handy.
Edit: From Wikipedia: "On 15 August, the major vulnerability was exploited. Over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted[who?]and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history."
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:41:51
There are so many people waiting to buy, just have to wait for this lag to go down.  Gox is pathetic.

Looks like the sell-off cleared a pretty big path in the depth chart, so the price can easily jump around now with low volumes (edit: see some big buys coming through now: 402.63 a minute ago at 39.478).  Around BTC68k+ dumped from my count on clarkmoody.

That's your right of course, but it's pretty common for them to flag accounts as high risk and they usually fix it without any problem.  Just search this subreddit for "coinbase high risk" and you'll find many examples.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:08:02
If you can get a buy order in, yes this would be a great time.  Once the lag works itself out the buy orders will quickly come rolling in.
