That is correct.

I'll agree 100% with you there

I summarize to people as:
Trezor is much easier to use (the Ledger Chrome App system is weird and unintuitive). But Nano S supports more cryptocurrencies and has a better approach to security (two SE chips for segregation of key data).

Running a non-mining node is a meaningless feel-good exercise. It's always been about the miners.
Either you'll have centralization via large mining pools due to large bandwidth requirements due to big blocks,
you'll have centralization due to large lightning hub operators who effectively have the ability to censor transactions. 
Bitcoin has always been destined for centralization, just depends which path it takes to get there. Markets always concentrate into a few big players because it's more efficient.
To quote Beauty and the Beast...it's a tale as old as time.

I'm down 150k in the last 24 hours. Gotta have a strong stomach for these swings.

Down 150k here. Sometimes ya just gotta say "welp....time to go back to my old friend pork and beans out of a can for a while"

Ledger Nano S supports more currencies as well. 
I have both, and while the Trezor is more intuitive and easy to use, the convenience of greater crypto support kind of clinched it for me, so I ended up using the Nano exclusively.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:12:39
Yeah, it's pretty basic.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:51:13
Great argument, you made some really good points.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:13:04
It's technically not, unfortunately :/
I say this as an owner of both. I WILL say the Trezor is much easier to use, I like their interface much more than the Nano S.
[This write-up]( on their security is a good read. TL;DR the Nano S takes a better approach to security with two SE chips
[Another article]( on their security approaches.

My feeling has been that Trezor has sort of stagnated (and not gone down in price) while it seems the Ledger team is more active in rolling out support for new cryptos. Could be wrong of course, but after owning both for a while I ended up just using the Nano S, even though I don't like the interface as much.

You're wrong, unfortunately.

That's what I was looking for, thanks

there was one guy on there who said he had mined 300 BTC with his Centrino or something, but it was pointless because they were only worth around a dollar each or something. ouch.

Putz? Is this the 80's? Are we using that word again?
