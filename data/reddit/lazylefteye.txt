Dai and usdc are good if you want to daytrade bitcoin, with the recent volatility. Dai can also be used as a savings acct that yields 12.25% apr interest if you supply it through coinbase wallet app, and the etherium dapp, compound. You can earn free dai and learn more about dapp’s through coinbase’s “earn” program. Why have a fiat savings acct. netting you 2% when you can get 12.25% returns with crypto. That being said hodl and don’t fuck with shitcoins !

Lol I’ve done this but was drunk. Transferred over a grand out and that same amount x2 back in. It will take 3-5 business days and they’ll post at the same exact time most likely, but yes it will transfer out of your bank acct.

Yep sorry bro. Been putting down some Pinot gricio. But it’s not untrustworthy. Look at the compound dapp yourself

Cash app cash card. It’s a visa. You gotta sell your BTC for fiat though, but it is instant

Got my father(65) in to it indirectly in early 2017, through his Ira, GBTC. With a small amount invested he netted huge gains. He couldn’t quite grasp the actual buying of bitcoin, but being an avid stock trader, he was able purchase GBTC and take full advantage of the run up and profited huge. Obviously he sold at the peak. Buying stock or ETF that is tied to bitcoin is something that generation knows how to do. Learning the world of crypto may not be for all of them.

You are basically being a bank and loaning the dai to someone who is taking the loan at like 15%. It’s a decentralized app on the etherium blockchain called, compound. It’s supported by coinbase and accessed through their wallet app, “coinbase wallet”. Different from the coinbase app

Every tx has a fee, Robinhood hides this with the bid/ask spread. You buy at the high ask and sell at the low bid. Coinbase pro has low fees but long deposit time. Cash app is pretty instant and fairly low fees

Just bought 48 AA batteries from overstock.com with bitcoin. It’s literally money. I Don't really care if in a year I could’ve bought 96 batteries for the same amount of bitcoin. I need the batteries now. Tx was simple as fuck and overstock.com has been doing it for years.

I bought a copper .1 BTC and it’s very solid, no issues with it being fragile

I buy shit with bitcoin all the time. Regular shit like batteries  and Furniture. You just gotta use the right online vendor. Overstock has been supplying me for years off of bitcoin. Yea that coffee table I got for .025 BTC in 2019 could buy me a house in 2030, but I(My wife) wanted that coffee table and we use it daily. Well worth the BTC. Now that being said, I buy more to hodl than to spend, but still spend BTC
