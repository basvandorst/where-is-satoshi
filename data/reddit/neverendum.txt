You're not really helping either, last time I checked Toronto was in Canada.
I don't see anything in the offer that precludes non-US citizens and the position on pooling is not explicit.

Thanks mate, seems like coinjar is the way to go. I assume inter-australian bank transfers don't get flagged then? I'll do a bit of Google fu when I get home, check there have been no bad experiences. Cheers.

I set up a new Bitcoin forum a couple of days ago for myself and a couple of friends I met through reddit. [bitcoinr.io](
All these problems of 1990's-style forums, threaded conversation, bubbling up interesting content etc. are being tackled by Jeff Attwood (coding_horror) of Stack Overflow fame. These guys are doing God's work with [Discourse](
It uses OAUth so you can log in with your Twitter, FB, GitHub account etc. which is nice. You can "like" content so interesting material floats up the "Hot" category etc.
It's a fully in-browser app so it's platform agnostic, works great on a mobile. No pagination, infinity scroll FTW.
I really like it, I'm going to keep this forum small, cap it off it grows or make it invite only. We're just daytrading mostly and I have a mining machine on order, we're small bananas. If any of yo fall into that camp or just have a relatively passive interest in Bitcoin then join up.
I've run massive forums before and it's no fun. This Discourse platform though is a pleasure to use and covers all the problems of traditional forums outlined in these posts. I set it up myself initially on Amazon EC2 and it's PITA with ubuntu, Redis, PostgreSQL, RoR but as the platform has developed it's got easier and much, much quicker. This Bitcoin forum is tiny, literally me and two other guys from a couple of days ago but another one I set up with Discourse has got bigger now and the performance is amazing.

Why can't there be millibits and microbits? I think if it became widely adopted they'd be known as Millies and Mikes.
Just because there are only two scales in most currencies (dollars and cents, pounds and pence) doesn't mean that three wouldn't be better.'
People do this already in common parlance, they talk about a 'grand' or a 'ton' etc. And in the extreme case in the UK there is a pony, a monkey and no end of useful factors.

Yeah, I just want to get the bitcoins into bitstamp really, I don't want to trade on another platform. Seems like they limit how much you can convert.

Ha, I'll give you $5k with where the price is now at. So if the order form had said "available", it would have gone through and taken my money. I wonder if there will be a rush of cancelled orders now and I might get in?
Otherwise, what about just rocking up to their address in Stockholm, think they'd sell anything at the door? I have to go to Europe soon, it wouldn't be much of an additional expense for me.

Yep, pretty convinced that Jeff Atwood is a genius. Stack Overflow is an incredible site. These guys at Discourse are working hard to modernize shitty forums.
I obviously love Reddit too but the search blows balls.

So you mean that you bought Editr theme and applied it to your existing site and it's a bit screwed up?
Not sure where your web dev knowledge is at so apologies if this sounds patronizing. There are two parts to a WP site, a MySQL database and a repository of files. To work on your site (offline) you need both of those things. The best tool to get those two things is a plugin called Duplicator.
If you install Duplicator on your site then send me a link to the Package it generates and the installer file, I'll work on it locally and see if it's easily fixed.
Otherwise, if you've done it live on production and it's screwed up you may have to trust me, or someone else, with your site's login details so I can fix it. Obviously PM  that if that's the way you want to go.

btcmarkets.net, these guys seem good and based in Melbourne. Looks like I can make a cash deposit and have it in the account in 3 hours. I emailed their support to see how long the verification process took and they emailed me straight back and said it was almost instant and I could do it now in advance of depositing the money. So, these guys seem like the go to me.

Thanks, I read some bad stuff about BFL on a forum, I'll go back and investigate it. I appreciate that there's a lot of misinformation around as people try to protect their positions.

What software is that video made with?
@_date: 2014-02-09 23:33:41
They should have a non-ad premium version, they could call it Google+. Hang on...

It's a Wordpress site running a theme based off one called [Editr](
Wordpress is by far the easiest CMS to use now and has the most plugins and user-base. Most stuff is open source, Wordpress is open source. This theme is $40. I think that would be worth it, it's worth paying for people to do all the mobile functionality right etc. There are still some very good free WP themes available though. I'm about to make a super quick video cast about setting up a fresh WP install on a localhost with a new theme so I'll link you when I've done it.
Edit : [Link](

True. Forgot that I have Log on as default as that makes most sense to me but you're right that linear would look worse to most people.

It wouldn't really be very logical to look at the 1 year chart and conclude that it's going down.
