If you generated this address, that means you have the private key for it.
Can be a tip to sweep new coins that come in to the address before the thief.

Is it possible to make some sort of analysis of orphan blocks, when two blocks have been found at around the same time (I would guess it would have to be at the same 1-5 sec to make a difference)?

Trying to understand.
- Oracles are needed (yes?)
- Oracles cost "money" to do/maintain.
- Oracle feeds can be copied, since the copy will be LOW COST compared to the original HIGH COST (from your blog post), then the copy will kill the original and we won't have oracles on Ethereum.

What kind of HW do you have?

Prices IMO can't be stable until most people use bitcoins for purchases instead of investing.
If you use bitcoins for investing, any fear in the market will push prices down and any hype will push it up. That is not as visable if investing is a minority to actually using bitcoin to buy merchendice.
That's why it's very important to 1. get merchants to accept bitcoin, 2. simply the initial download of the blockchain 3. show other advantages than only anonymity (low transaction costs for example).

As more and more non-tech-sabby people start using bitcoin, the concept of "loosing your wallet" and private key cryptography need to be explained.
I'm afraid that a trojan with a keylogger and a few nasty headlines is all that it takes to scare the general public away from bitcoin in the mainstream.

If you make sure the transaction is confirmed by multiple sources before accepting it, you avoid the duplicate transaction.

yes, that is created according to this guide

This is bad because it shows that there is major speculation in bitcoins. The BTC doesn't need more speculators or hoarders, it need users.

Since the difficulty adjusts to the new total mining capacity (hash/s) what you need to do is to calculate how big of a share of the total capacity you have (hash/s). If you have 100% of the capacity you will get 25btc per 7-10 minutes. If you have 1% it's on average 0,25btc per 7-10 min and so on. Calculate cost of HW and electricity and you will see how profitable you may be.
Of course if you are first with a ASIC you will have a bigger share of the total mining capacity in the beginning, and it might be hard to estimate what the future hash/s will be.
