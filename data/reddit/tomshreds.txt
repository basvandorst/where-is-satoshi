I guess it would be kind of hard to stay on the edge against investors and corporations. I guess I read too many articles dating the early 2010s when people were mining like 15btc per day! Thanks for your reply!

I live in Québec, the second cheapest Canadian province electricity-wise so I guess it might be worth a look but honestly, the more I read about it the more I think it's a bad idea. It's seems so incredibly volatile. I noticed the BTC has been downing for a while so I guess it might be worth the investment soon, I guess I'll buy instead of mine! Cloud mining seemed more like a gamble to me but I'm glad to know bitcoincloudservices are legit, I went there earlier and wondered if they were worth the investment. Thanks a lot for the honest answer, I now know understand better!

Thanks for the honest answer, that's what I was slowly figuring out. The rates seems so low most of the time that I'm starting to think it's not worth it. I guess I'll end up only buying instead of mining.

is this profitable? I mean is it worth it? For example could I mine litecoins and get bitcoins in return? I heard about websites like middle coin / clevermining where they pay you daily bitcoin for mining litecoins. I wonder if those are worth it? Cheers
