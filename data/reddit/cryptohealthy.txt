I want to invest but not on Coinbase. It is a shitty exchange. I've read a lot of bad comments on their subreddit.

really? because My friend told me that Coinbase still owes him $300 since January and Support are not replying to him.

I  kinda agree on this picture because 1BTC has a big value already.

I like seeing things like this. It really looks nice and this is a one good reason why cryptocurrency is the future. I know one day cryptocoin will be the currency we use for the future.

Meeh. I will still not invest on them. They have the worst customer support. I much prefer KuCoin  better than them.

Just buy some directly to the developer. We don't know if its a trash or what.

It looks really futuristic compared to some other BTC ATM around the globe.
