I think that your departure point is from a personal lifestyle, which is fair.
My departure point is that of a third world country and perhaps of the collectivist impact of a big BTC cap versus a smaller BTC cap. And I would say at the current market cap BTC adoption is more dystopian than utopian—I don't personally know single person that can use BTC in the way they can use traditional fiat. Transaction costs being the primary inhibitor and energy use by extension secondary. BTC use in this scenario is either to survive a fiat crash or as a hard investment—both not applicable to your use case.
However, my objection to using BTC is something else, and that is that the spread of wealth through BTC is perhaps worse than through something like the plain old US$. However, this last point is perhaps a different topic.

I understood only about half of what you are saying. Do you mean that he sells small volumes repeatedly at just above the transaction fee? say 17200+48 &lt; 17250 and then he makes say $2 per transaction?

I agree with the adoption point argument. I don't have any BTC left at all and I don't see how I can buy a roll of toiletpaper with BTC unless it's 2012.
The way it "feels" at the moment is that it is a zero sum game where BTC adoption or non-adoption is both not viable. I don't like the idea of randomly spreading wealth at the expense of all the usual erks: energy usage, traceability, transaction limits, etc.
Non-adoption is "not viable" in the sense that all these buyers are now going to lose a shitload of money and yet again random removal of wealth.
