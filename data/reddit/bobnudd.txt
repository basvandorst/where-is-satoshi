Thanks. What stands out skimming through the list are the sensationalist, pro-bitcoin articles. Will the wiki accept articles that critique bitcoin, and dare I say it discuss the flaws in decentralised currencies?

I think you are rich with that amount of money.

In the future, do you think there will be 100's of cryptocurrencies, or just a handful?

It takes just one copycat to start receiving your donations

How will the super rich protect their existing dominance?
Though thinking about it the super rich can probably invest right now.
Another thought. Cold storage has to be  thing to do for the future. I wonder how many coins have already been lost.

Because of the financial inequality that it may create.

Wait. So all early adopters who have accumulated large amounts of bitcoin will be very rich compared to the  laggards? Seems unfair.

What are​ you going to do with your investment?
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:46:36
This is true. Theoretically I would still be an early adopter.

Why is the world really stupid? 
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:16:12
Stop being aggressive. I was merely comparing inequality. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:18:17
Unfair is probably the wrong word to use. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:44:57
I see. And for all the anti-capitalist sentiment that has prevailed throughout the world, there will also be future anti-bitcoin protests? 
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:54:11
I have said that unfair was maybe the wrong word. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:51:29
You are assuming everyone wants bitcoins. Do anti capitalists secretly want a piece of the action?
