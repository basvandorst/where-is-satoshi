Bitcoin isn't decentralised at all though, but I get your point.

The price will continue to boom and bust, but each cycle will be longer and less volatile than the previous one. It's starting to boom now, hasn't reached the peak yet. It will pop eventually, that's how bitcoin has always worked.

It's eight in the morning in western Europe now, we have money too.

That feel when too much potential profit is annoying though.

It's a logarithmic scale, the line is between 1000 and 10000, in other words it's at ~4200.

I like your optimism.

Don't use bitcoin to buy stuff, use litecoin, ethereum, monero, Zcash, dash, vertcoin, groestlcoin or any other coin you think is cheap enough. Use bitcoin as a store of value instead of as a currency.

Well aren't you fancy with your coins and all, the rest of us buy high and sell low!

It's like saying the Einstein, it's not grammatically correct. No one has ever called it the bitcoin.

Thanks, I fixed the link.

He was clearly talking English, read what he wrote and you'll see it says "the bitcoin", and that's English. It's like old people talking about "the facebook", it's not called the facebook, it's called facebook. Why is this even a question?

It's not only bitcoin that is a threat, it's the technology behind cryptocurrencies that is threatening. Bitcoin is the first big one, but there are up and comers, new "coins" with innovative solutions that have yet to materialise etc. The technology is the disruptor, not bitcoin.

I'm just curious, but have you considered a docker image instead? I'm running a dockerized litecoin node and it works fine just doing its thing on a dedicated raspberry pi.

The bitcoin blockchain will split in two in november, the new one is called btc1/segwit2x/s2x, and is trying to solve a problem with a different solution than the original bitcoin code, called bitcoin core.
Because of how bitcoin relays transactions, btc1 is trying to high jack the bitcoin core system by fooling it into thinking that btc1 is regular old bitcoin. And this is nefarious because btc1 should compete on its own merits and not by using shady tactics.
They're doing this because they know they need to because they don't have enough support from the network.
Meanwhile, people who own bitcoin should move them to a wallet where they control the private keys, that way they're guaranteed to get btc1 after the blockchain splits, it's free money, hold them or sell them for more bitcoins. There are rumors that coinbase will turn your bitcoins into btc1 and not give you your bitcoins if you try to withdraw them. That's theft because you paid for bitcoin but was given something you didn't pay for, that didn't even exist at the time of your purchase.
You can't trust any exchange to do what's right.

That's not true, nodes are very important for influencing which version of the code that will succeed. Andreas Antonopoulos talks about it in this video: 
Tl;dw nodes validate transactions.

Make sure to secure your bitcoins in case the state tries to confiscate it. Make a fool proof backup that can't be cracked. Research cold storage and other methods of secure backup.

Do you have a source for this?
