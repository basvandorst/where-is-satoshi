Here are some questions. What do you buy with bitcoins? Why do you exchange money for bitcoin instead of using said money in the first place and have a broader market open to you that also protects buyers/sellers? How do you have the necessity to use it every day? Why don't you just bulk buy whatever you are buying? You can't spend that stuff on essentials like food/bills so idk how you manage to spend it every day. 
Like VERY few people use bitcoins now. You either don't spend them cause you want a profit from your bitcoins, you spend them so you can reinvest or invest into something different and get profit, or you spend it all cause you are afraid of a price drop.

Steam announced they won't accept it, i guess it is artificially inflated to counter that.

if it makes you feel better they still have no use, idk why they keep rising

Well why is it continuing to rise when there is no system around it? It would be a much more attractive option if you could easily buy them, spend them on a lot of places and have stuff like buyer/seller protection.

i still see fail to see the benefits of bitcoins over digital/real money. If i have 100 usd in paypal why would i go through the trouble of buying bitcoins to use them instead of just using my 100 usd in every digital/real life shop? Like unless we get paid in bitcoins, i don't see its advantages.

I meant it in a way that their only value comes from selling it to other people, which isn't real value. I don't see why anyone would go out of their way, buy bitcoins and then use the bitcoins for goods and services in very limited areas digitally. Why not just cut the exchange crap and buy the stuff you want faster and easier without the risk of scams and problems.

So they are artificially inflated?

Just a question, what do people use bitcoins for? Like why are they rising, what makes people increase their demand and what makes people use them over regular money? To me they have the same function as regular money but more of a hassle to use and have limited options, they should be going down since they offer nothing better, just different.
