To my knowledge, none of us are aware of how to use bitcoins. I thought Dorian made that point painfully.

The topic has been edited. I hope you are more convinced.

Actually, Arthur called Leah an asshole when she called him initially. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:25:32
Not sure how to respond. Would you take "relative" instead? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:01:10
Only Arthur. According to him, there are still news vans and journalists outside the house. This prevents us from seeing Dorian.

As mentioned in the topic, some expenditures require cash at hand. At the moment, I am not at liberty to divulge any specific information per Dorian's request, but Art has used all of his rainy day fund and his fishing fund to pay for meals and to replace horrendously outdated electronic equipment for Dorian. When I showed him Windows 7, he complained that he wanted nothing to do with Microsoft after dealing with windows ME. That is how old his recently retired PC is. I gave him my laptop that was a graduation gift from Art to use in college, and Art compensated me with a less expensive one. Dorian's old printer was a low DPI dot matrix printer with a serial port. 
Needless to say, our money was used to bring Dorian close to 1.5 decades into the future so that he may adequately communicate and to find out the extent of Newsweek's damage to his image. Until yesterday, he had only my and Art's collective inputs regarding the exposure of privacy.

I was offering my help to as he was writing the post. I recall seeing Dorian's Japanese name here or there in posts regarding bitcoin, but we did not really draw any correlation because I had figured it to be a mere coincidence. 
As far as the actual currency, I have seen and heard things about it through the websites I frequent, but none of us know anything specific about what it really is. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:04:10
Not in this sense. I figured "Satoshi Nakamoto" would as common as "John Smith". There is a correlation now because he is in the media's eye. Please do not twist my words.

I'm merely thanking you guys. No money needed. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:53:06
Thank you very much. I have notified Dorian's brother. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:22:22
How would we go about doing this? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:52:14
We have made attempts, but no communication aside from initial contact has been had, despite us trying to contact Andreas. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:57:42
Proof will be provided if this comes to fruition. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:28:59
It only took one phone call. Our family generally stays out of the public eye, but only because we are normal people. According to Arthur, she was very probing and lots of things have been misquoted so far. He is never quick to respond in such a careless manner -that is just his nature. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:11:09
Pi day! :D (as you could imagine, we're all math nerds)
@_date: 2014-03-24 22:21:49
What platform offers auctions in Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:29:36
I'm sure he would, it's one of his passions, but right now, direct contact is all but impossible, even with his own family, he is hard to reach. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:28:49
He said to me that he called her an asshole. She did twist his words. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:34:25
I can confirm that this is authentic. Proof incoming. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:23:22
"Your thoughts, prayers, and good will are what we really need in a time like this. We continue to thank this community, and all of the other communities that are banding together to protect my brother in a time like this. And thank you, Coincult."

Art's son figures it would be a good story to tell his children one day. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:51:07
Will do. I am working on getting him updated with current technology, and he's catching on quickly. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:55:08
This "buck" does not go to anybody but Dorian. Art has been doing his best to support Dorian and their mother, but he cannot do anything if he runs out of money. Neither of us sees a penny. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:10:24
This is exactly what we are faced with. Medical conditions of both he and his mother already compromised finances, and the timing of this could not have been worse.  
I am not allowed to elaborate any further.

has edited his post to include more proof. I hope this is more convincing. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:26:44
To all of you wondering about the status of the donations: I have been requested to not disclose any information as of yet. Thank you. As always, we are very humbled that the community is working together for the sake of our misfortune. It brings a tear to my eye and our family's. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:42:41
The model trains are almost all gone, sad to say. Art has gotten a Dorian a new phone, which I was teaching him how to use yesterday (in the picture). The first thing he wanted to do when I showed him YouTube was look at trains.

The nephew is requesting a copy of the Newsweek magazine so that his uncle can sign it. Could anyone help him out?
