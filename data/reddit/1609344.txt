That's because he wants to reduce the blocksize. So he is against normal users using segwit because it is effectively increasing the blocksize.

You will have lower fees personally when you send from a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:08:52
Try it and see. You can't do shit with segwit and the current core wallet. There is one little command ing the console to produce a single test receive address in P2SH format, and that's it.
But they are working on it.

For a long time I have had this idea of a "bitcoin heater".
Right now, people buy 2+kW portable heaters to heat their houses which just turn electricity directly into heat. Instead of a heating element, why not a heater full of bitcoin mining cores which pump out the same heat.
Sell them to people around the world and whenever they switch on they will mine. The electrticity is "free" since it is needed for heating anyway.
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:33:01
Give them a cut of the mining proceeds. Could be in the form of a discount on electricity bill for using it, or whatever.  And the device could have a built in data modem with an agreement with a service provider, like a Kindle has. The user don't have to "connect" it to anything, it just works.

Only the sending address matters. Payment can be to P2PKH address and it is still a segwit tx.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:42:52
No only the sender has to have a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:41:26
Due to lack of replay protection, once block 494,784 hits I'd advise doing nothing at all. Don't make any transactions until everything has settled down.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:18:58
Suggesting to start by paying 5 sat/byte (about $0.05 typically) and wait a few hours (or more like a couple of days, at the moment). If in a hurry, replace the transaction with a higher fee.

@_date: 2017-11-10 13:35:39
Except that it was never certain that segwit would activate at all.
I'm guessing most wallet devs made the sensible decision to wait till after segwit was activated on the network before commmitting resources to revamping their software.
Most wallet devs will be working on it right now.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:16:28
This is exactly how I see it going.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:20:26
This is correct. Having reviewed the code I can confirm BTC1 expects the forking block at 494783. (The confusion comes because the parameter passed to `VersionBitsState()`is supposed to be the parent block of the block you actually want to check. Hence the off by one.)

It's not really there actually. Just the `getwitnessaddress` cli method which is just for testing. But basic support for sending to bech32 addresses is coming soon.

It exists, it's called [Bitcoin Clashic](
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:03:13
Core will process and validate segwit in the node functionailty, but not in the wallet functionailty. So it's not much use for those who use Core as a wallet and want to make segwit transactions. Currently it only has the getwitnessaddress RPC call, which generates a backward-compatible P2SH address, and this is really just meant for testing. It doesn't support native segwit BIP173 addresses yet at all, and can't even send to them. (But it is [coming]( by the look of it.)

@_date: 2017-11-09 19:12:09
It's not a good point since that there are very few wallets yet that can generate segwit transactions. Therefore it is much too early to call segwit a failure or draw any conclusions at all really.

Not true. Even with listening disabled, your node will connect to 8 other notes and relay transactions to them and validate and propagate blocks. All connections are fully symmetric so it doesn't matter who connected to who.
The only thing it can't do is seed historic blocks to new nodes.
Enabling listening will also increase the total number of simultaneous connections.

And yet you still presented it as a credible source. Amazing.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:12:20
There are multiple implementations. Miners use different code to produce blocks than nodes use to validate them.  So, nodes are stuck waiting for a &gt;1MB block at height 494783 which ain't gonna come because miners hardcoded 494784 into their config. They can fix it with a conf change, but it's still embarassing.

A network error could not cause this since requires the user to sign the fraudulent transaction.
Genuine mistake also unlikely since any sanely written client software would not allow creation of fraudulent transactions. Possibly a malware wallet software could maliciously create fraudulent transactions to fuck with the user.

No, it is not possible to make a Bitcoin transaction without a fee. There is a minimum relay fee in the Bitcoin software.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:30:35
If nobody broadcasts any transactions on B2X they will be mining empty blocks forever. Ordinary users can support core by not placing transactions on B2X network. Also by running a full core node if possible.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:43:07
Buy a Ledger Nano S.
Or even better download Bitcoin Core and let it sync up with the blockchain and run a full node.
Failing that Electrum will do.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:56:32
That would be sufficient to get your node to send it out to the network. But the relaying nodes you send it to would reject it because of the fee being less than the minimum relay fee. So it would not propagate and would therefore not get picked up by any miners.
Of course if you could mine it directly into your own block then you would avoid the problem.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:27:48
Ledger - PRO: Very secure, easy to use. CON: Costs money and a bit fiddly, relies on 3rd party service.
Bitcoin Core - PRO: Direct connection to bitcoin network from your home PC, no relying on any 3rd party service. Option to run full node and contribute to Bitcoin infrastructure. CON: Takes several days to synchronise blockchain and has to be kept running all the time (or at least synced regularly). Needs ~60GB disk space.
Electrum - PRO: Robust and easy to use, can use instantly. Well respected software. CON: Not a lot but you rely on Electrum servers which relay your transactions.
I usually recommend Electrum to beginner. Make sure to WRITE DOWN AND SAFELY STORE YOUR SEED WORDS. Then your coins are safe and secure.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:15:19
Depends what sort of wallet you have. The original bitcoin software "wallet.dat" file actually contains the keys. So if you lose the wallet file you lose the keys.
More modern HD (heirarchical deterministic) wallets are based on a seed phrase (usually 12 or 24 words) and as long as you have the seed, you can recreate your wallet using a fresh copy of the software.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:47:20
You can do a low transaction fee if you don't mind waiting a few hours. 
Saying that I did two separate transactions today both with a transaction fee of less than 1 sat/byte (so fee about $0.01) and was surprised to see both were confirmed in the first block. The were RBF transactions just in case but I never needed to replace them.

No need a for a hardware wallet, a software wallet is fine. Just not on an exchange. You don't actually OWN the coins on the exchange, the exchange does. You just have an IOU.

I would say whoever controls the PGP signing key for bitcoin core releases has a huge gatekeeper role.

You taking things to an extreme and putting words in my mouth again.

So do you think investment bankers behave like this? ;)

Whether it's controlled by one individual or a team, the keyholder(s) have a significant influence. That's all I'm saying. Not sure what you are arguing about.

Honestly I think Ledger Nano S is excellent. The software part of it (implemented via Chrome apps) is very well designed and easy to use. Best wallet UI I have used. And signing transactions by pressing the button on the device makes you feel like a boss.

Of course, that *could* happen, but not without overwhelming community consensus. There is a large amount of built up trust in the current team and the reliability of the signed builds. Like it or not, there is an inertia to that. Most people won't readily switch to a new fork by an unknown team.

I read both and I am very disappointed by the conduct I see in both subs. I know there must be reasonable people on both sides but unfortunately the loud voice of tribal warriors on both sides drown out reasonable discussion.

"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was the title of the original book from 1964.

OK that makes sense - thanks.

ZING! This guy, folks.

This is what you have to do every time you spend your bitcoin. You sign the transaction with your private key which proves it was you that authorised the transaction. Normally the wallet software does this for you - typically you would have to enter your password into the wallet.
On the Ledger, the private keys are locked securely inside the device and it signs the transaction for you at the push of a button.

Does this mean that there will be no coinbase transaction, or that the coinbase tx will have a zero value?

Here's my suggestion:
First you buy.
If it drops, you buy more.
If it goes up, you buy more.
Repeat for next 10 years.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:30:57
Beceuase nobody can know where the bottom is. If you beleive it will eventually go back up, then buying more every time it goes down is a safe strategy. Selling with the intent to rebuy is more risky.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:09:48
Does this apply when it falls too?
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:34:08
I can wait.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:09:03
It's only $50 might as well buy bitcoin with it. I'm sure he/she can get another $50.
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:15:26
Exactly.
