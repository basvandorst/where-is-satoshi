I don't understand caveden's first point either.
What stops me from exporting my wallet keys from my phone to my wife's phone? (simple to do with Bitcoin Wallet for Android app). We both have the same wallet now on each phone. (This much I've done myself at home.)
Then I go to buy something with Bitcoin in one store while at the same time my wife is buying something in the shop next door. Very easy to walk into two adjacent shops and ensure the payments are both being done at the same time (within 30 seconds of each other anyway). A double spend seems easy to pull off here, and it could take over ten minutes before one gets rejected and we're both long gone.
Again sorry if I'm misunderstanding something very basic here.

I don't see why authorities wouldn't include "your current disclosure canary must be maintained" as part of the gag order.

Would like to know this also? Trying to decide which to do.
What's in it for Kraken to offer to process Gox creditors claims?
I notice that claims through the Gox system are payed out at 1BTC = $483 (in yen). What rate are Kraken offering? Or do they just give you bitcoin which is now worth less than "goxcoins" at the rate above.

Would like to know this too. The official Gox claim system here:  is paying out at 1BTC = $483 (in yen).
What's the best claims system to go through? Gox or Kraken?

It seems you can, it just takes 8 weeks.
If I had a large amount of BTC to sell, I'd probably move it to Gox and sell it there. I'd get 10% more $$$ than from other exchanges. Worth the wait in my opinion.
EDIT: I'm not in US.

Ok so $985/mBTC :)

Sorry for your situation, I was also in Laos at the start of the year watching it rise unable to buy.
Eventually I was able to buy some with credit card through btcquick, might be worth giving them a go.
I was actually thinking of this only a few days ago, that people in third world countries must find it very difficult to get bitcoin, and therefore bitcoin must be worth a lot more in those areas.
