Glad to hear they're both just having technical issues instead of dropping the payment option.  Thank you for the info.

Zeevex no longer sells Steam cards.

They stated that they're working to restore Bitcoin payment.

To play with two Steam accounts we would need to buy two copies of the game.  Since it's DRM free I can just copy it to her computer, you don't even need Steam open to run it.
It's still early beta, but I really like it.  I think if they keep adding content and features then it'll be a great game.

Any chance you have plans to add Steam gift cards?
Or Best Buy, since they sell Steam Cards?

It wasn't in a bundle, I bought it from the [Humble Store](

Yeah, I bought Starbound from the store a week or two ago and payed with Bitcoin.  That option doesn't seem to be there any more.

Zeevex stopped selling Steam cards a good while ago.

A lot of people complain about the distinction of "good guys" and "bad guys" in that show.  I think that was done intentionally.  I agree with Liber8's message, but not their methods.  That makes them much more interesting than the generically evil bad guys in most shows.

Can you still convert from Zeevex to Steam though?  I don't see it listed.

Full price, but there's no DRM so my wife and I can play at the same time.
