Bcash! Bcash! Bcash!

My local bank treats me very well, they aren't all bad.

LOL the US Gov't is getting scammed.

 Read the last sentence, then go ahead and edit your comment.

The blockchain
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:05:17
Hopefully we'll start getting more exchanges that accept new accounts. Otherwise I agree, it won't end well. On the other hand, they are one of the few exchanges that accept credit cards. They are creating a lot of weak handed speculators.

Oh...The implication was that we don't need to tell the IRS about transactions under $600 or the gains from those transactions.

Holding on to money is precisely what makes someone rich.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:36:21
True, I get what you're saying. But I would consider making investments as more or less holding on to money or at least value. I just don't think it's bad or inhibiting for me to hodl bitcoin as well as using it as a currency, which I do. The scary thing is that there are people that have doubted me that I got into bitcoin by using it as a currency.

Fiat will be huge! We'll have the best fiat, everyone will love. So many fiats.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:36:01
Have you tried using bitcoin.tax? It's helping quite a bit so far. But still going to a tax pro after I get everything entered into there.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:53:42
I'm not sure a stable price is possible without centralization or mass adoption. Just keep using it as a currency as often as possible and it'll average out.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:02:40
But you just commented that it will be worthless in three days. When do we buy?
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:25:51
But the hyped nonsense is where the gains are these days unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:32:10
Thanks, yea I just read the $600 part and got excited because of that bill.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:09:51
Plastic and metal, just like a lmbo
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:25:41
Yeah man, was just making sure you did.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:06:17
And bitcoin would still be up like 200% for the year.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:29:52
Well yeah, don't keep coin on exchanges, especially those that are designed for trading cards...it was magic the gathering online exchange, not Mount Gox.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:21:17
These are the dips that make future headlines "Bitcoin up 300% in 6 months"
Edit:bitcoin is up over 300% in 6 months right now..."Bitcoin up 1000% in 3 months"
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:50:47
That's already been done before. I think it was called bitcoin cash or something like that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:32:09
You do realize you're taxed on the gains when you sell, not the whole value, right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:11:25
Proof or gtfo
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:19:54
Don't bite the hand that feeds you!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:17
Problems? I have a few
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:47:13
By who? A significant portion of my holdings is from gambling and I've never had a problem.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:35:22
Trezors were 60 bucks on amazon 2 weeks ago. Shoulda bought the dip.
@_date: 2018-05-02 23:37:32
Look at the rise and fall in the 2013-2014 and compare to this rise and fall. Sure there are some differences but the fear is real.
@_date: 2018-05-03 09:21:14
Not sure if it's still the case but blockchain.info used to be the recommended wallet to use for/by poker players.

When the price of a gallon of milk is 500 usd, yes.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:06:32
We should embrace it. Sounds better than a typo by a drunk on a bad day.
