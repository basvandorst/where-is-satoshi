I see where you going and there is valid sentiment in your words, but I am going to have to respectfully disagree.  Also, you left off the "/s" at the end of your post, but mentally I added it.
I will admit that I do upvote a lot of your post and comments, but I am going to have to disagree with the likelihood on this one.
Bitcoin is simply not that much of a threat to rise to the top of their problems worth dealing with.  They are way too overwhelmed with the pending financial crisis in the US and worldwide, like with the G7 for example.
Have you heard of any plans to go on the offense or even the defense to Bitcoin from the G7?  I ask because I genuinely do not know.  The US would definitely not do it alone.  They would definitely need most if not all of the G7 acting in unison.  What is the likelihood of that?

More specificially, miners are generating nonce values and hashing the block with that nonce in the block.  If the hash value they get from that is less than the value of difficulty, then they have found a 'correct' nonce.  There could be more than one nonce though, but probably not many, which is why it is so hard to find.
Also, there is no way to predict which value will give a desired hash.  There are no getting colder or getting warmer hints available.  It is only found with a 'lucky' guess.

What is impeding it is that in the US every time a bitcoin changes ownership it is a taxable event for the transmitter.  It is an impossible burden to manage if someone is using it like a local currency.
@_date: 2019-07-21 18:42:43
I doubt fees will be 0, but I do agree with your first point.
I think the reason you are getting down votes is the use of the word greedy.  It is not greedy to voluntarily provide a service and get paid for it.  Miners are not greedy, they are simply doing the work necessary to collect their share of the funds available for their service.  They are not getting a free lunch and they are not stealing money from anyone by mining, nor enslaving anyone to do so.

Capital gain/loss calculation for tax purposes.
If I convert my dollars to euros, or spend either one of them, I do not have to calculate a capital gain/loss with those currencies, but I do with Bitcoin.  That is what needs to change.
@_date: 2019-07-21 17:10:26
No.  (read on...)
If you *exchange* bitcoin for **anything**, ( or give it to someone else), you must re-calculate the value of the bitcoin to determine if it has increased, decreased or stayed the same since the time of purchase.
If the value has increased then there is a realized capital gain.  If the value has decreased then there might be a realized capital loss.  If the value has not changed, then there can be no gain or loss.
The IRS does not recognize Bitcoin as a currency.  To them it is virtual property.  If you buy Bitcoin, you did exactly that.  You made a **purchase** of a capital asset, just like if you buy a house.  It is not an *exchange* or conversion like with a government sanctioned currency.
However, if the US congress passed a law treating it as a recognized currency, (foreign or otherwise), then the IRS would have to change its classification.  Have you written your congressman and two senators yet?
Similarly, if I you bought $50,000 in Bitcoin and gave it to me, I would have a $50,000 capital gain, just like if you bought a house and gave it to me, or you just gave me $50,000 outright.  It is all the same with respect to capital gain/loss.
However, I think there is an exception if the value is less than $600/year, but I am not 100% sure of the time frame or the exact amount. *Again, check with the IRS for complete details.*  They have a website.  
I have only bought and sold crypto, never exchanged it, and I have filed all of my gains and losses on my tax return.

I just had an idea.  Maybe someone needs to just make a full node as an appliance, or turnkey, and then sell them.  They could even be populated, so that all the buyer has to do is plug it in and turn it on, then let it update to the latest chain over the network.
Your average geek can make one for himself, but not the average person.  If we want more "trustable" full nodes, we need to lower the barrier to having one.
Just a thought.

I do not mean to hijack u/affordalisimo's post with this, but you are thinking in the right direction.
However, if I loosen the physical requirement, perhaps, the way to do it is to simply exchange authentication credentials for an online only wallet.  That exchange would not need blockchain action, and the recipient could verify that they have sole control by changing the password and 2FA authentication.  That is provided that the private key is never presented, but that would go without saying.

Since the blockchain, general ledger of Bitcoin is public, if your identity is ever linked to a Bitcoin address, then all of the other associations with that address can be linked.
For example, you buy something on line and have it shipped to your house.  If the vendor collects your name, address, e-mail, phone number, they are also going to know the Bitcoin address you sent the Bitcoin from.  If the authorities get the information from the vendor, then they know your personal information is linked to that Bitcoin address.  And that Bitcoin address has probably sent and received BTC to and from other Bitcoin addresses and they can just follow the chain.
So is it private?  Only if you never divulge a link in your chain.  And who is good enough to get that right 100% of the time?

Sure.  I think bitcoin goes out to 9 decimal places.  They could just do Satoshis as their minimum unit.  The actual value of a nations currency in that nation is relative to its demand in the nation.  If it is rare, then it is more valuable, just like the US dollar was 20 years ago.
As the nation has something to offer and earns BTC from outside of it, then it becomes less rare, but as well as know, there is a limit to how less-rare BTC can become; unlike the USD.

Good question, but how could it be outlawed?
To be outlawed you would have to define it.  How would you define bitcoin **in** ***law***\*\*?\*\*  We could just change the name or change the code, then it no longer meets the law's definition.  They are not going to say "Bitcoin is outlawed".  We would just change the name of it to Nancy Pelosi.  Yeah, now go outlaw that.  I dare you.
It is just bits in a computer.  Just harmless little bits whizzing over the Internet.  What is wrong with that?  There is no victim.
In the US, I have the right to free association, the right to free speech.  Outlawing bitcoin would be a violation of those rights.  Even the supreme court has defended these rights.
Besides, the genie is already out of the bottle, and there are too many big players in it now with influence over the government.  It would not be in government's interest to outlaw it.  Alcohol prohibition was overturned and they are losing the war on drugs.  Government it too consumed with its current list of failures to even think twice about Bitcoin.
In the US, the government and FBI are too busy trying to finger Trump to even know that there is a world going on, much less bitcoin.
Do not discount the inability of the old guard to even understand it to know that it could replace them.
And never discount hubris.  They have their collective heads shoved so far up their politics that they cannot even understand it well enough to even know how it affects them.
If the US were to outlaw it, then her enemies would move to legalize it and promote it.  It is the ole adage, "The enemy of my enemy is my friend."  The first country to embrace it before the others gets the head start at the next wave of untold wealth.  As soon as one of them figures it out, the rest will follow suit or fall behind into the history books.
Just listen to the old thinking of the past like Jamie Dimon, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Kevin O'Leary, and the ignorant things they say about bitcoin, and then double down on it without any shame at all.  The government is full of those types of hypocritical cock suckers.  They are the dinosaurs of the 20th century.  The 21st century is going to leave them behind.
Half of the world is trying to abandon or replace the petrodollar.  The federal reserve and the federal government have much, much bigger problems on their hands to the tune of multiple trillions of dollars to even think about little ole bitcoin that is 3 orders of magnitude smaller.  It is like the adult version of Lord of the Flies up on capitol hill.  A bunch of old farts, yelling jibberish, running around in wet underwear, shaking a stick and trying to get their turn at the conch shell.
Bitcoin is a paradigm shift so abstract that it is not like anything else.  The best they can do to understand it is to compare it to something that it is not.  Well that is pointless.  Those old fossils in government cannot conceive of it, its abilities, or know what to do with it.  You might as well being asking a monkey what to do with Bitcoin.  -"I don't know. Banana?  Are you Star Wars?"  That is government's understanding of Bitcoin.

We are going to disagree.  Profit is not greed.  **Excess profit** to the point of enslavement or customer destruction **is** greed.  For example, selling a drunk a drink, or convincing someone that they need a $50,000 car loan, when a $20,000 car is all they really need.
The only way any good or service is provided to you is by way of profit.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  Block creators will be paid by transaction fees.  If you want to set up your node so that it only processes transactions with no fee, you are free to do so.  Have at it.  I dare you.
The hash rate will be determined by the *revenue* that pays for it.  Right now, there is a lot of revenue paying for the hashing rate, thus it is high.  The term in economics is called inflation.  As the revenue goes down, so will the hash rate.  That is called deflation.
By the way, there is no need to wait for altruism to kick in.  You can start yours today.  Go ahead and run a full node on an old computer today, as many hours a day as you like.  How many hours a day do you run your node?
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:48:19
Excellent comment.
Are you sure that transactions would be lost?  Why would the nodes not share all of their transactions from the point of the split, and view those as unprocessed transactions and go about reprocessing them?
Or do nodes only share unconfirmed transactions?
@_date: 2019-07-21 04:52:27
If the current method of creating blocks is not sustainable, it can be changed.  I would like to point out that Bitcoin does not have to use a blockchain and its current proof of work algorithm.  It could be switched over to something more efficient such as hash graph or something else that will be discovered later on in the future.
The issue that concerns me is the size of the blockchain itself, but perhaps new computer and new storage performance will keep ahead of it.  But there are ways to break it up and segment it if needed.
The implementation of Bitcoin can change, if necessary, without giving up its core principles.

It is called "capital gain/loss".
If you bought it at $5,000 and then sold or traded it for something else at $10,000, then you have a gain.
If you bought it at $20,000 and then sold or traded it for something else at $10,000, then you have a loss.
You must pay your taxes on your gains, but you can deduct your losses with caveats.

@_date: 2019-07-19 13:28:49
Neither.  It is the exchange rate or equivalency.  1 USD is equal to that specified amount of the specified currency.
For example, if you have $1 US and want to exchange it for a British Pound Sterling, then you will only get 0.80 of a Pound.  Likewise if you have a whole BPS then you can get $1.20 US for it.
There is, of course, a fee for doing the exchange. For example like 1% - 7% in local currency.  So if I am in the US and exchange it, then I will pay the exchange fee in dollars, but if I am in London, England, then I will pay in British Pounds Sterling for the exchange fee; whatever it is; which varies by institution.

The amount of electricity that bitcoin consumes, with respect to outlawing it, is a red herring.  It is a comparative fallacy.
Bitcoin miners participate **voluntarily.**  If it was not economical to do so, or if they did not see some other value in it, then they would not do it.
Drive around your city at night and look at all of the decorative lighting, all of the billboards, all of the names and logos on tops of tall buildings.  That creates nothing and waste electricity
Consider all of those TV sets that are on every day, and of **the people just sitting around, doing nothing**, watching nothing of value.  That is waste.
All of the bullshit that people spend electricity on every day is way more of a problem than the electricity spent on bitcoin, that does produce something of value.
Bitcoin will become more electricrally efficient when it is economical to do so.  Do I wish it was now? Yes.  But it is not up to me.

4. Being able to pay one's taxes in Bitcoin instead of local currency.
5. Making Bitcoin transactions untraceable like Monero as an example.
6. Making it easier to get Bitcoin without all of the KYC, limits, and high exchange fees, etc.  Or basically lower the barrier to conveniently and safely exchanging dollars for BTC.
7. A new consensus algorithm that makes it orders of magnitude cheaper to mine it, so that everyone can participate cheaply and profitably. 
8. A change in the protocol that will lower the transaction fee 1 or 2 orders of magnitude, and/or, raise the performance 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.

The current cost of mining is a perfect example of inflation.  It cost the amount it does because there is that much money chasing it.  That is, there is money available to support the cost and then some.
Lets take an extreme example.  Let's say the reward for creating a single block was one million dollars.  How much would people pay to be the one to make just one block a day?  Now, lets say the reward is $5 for a single block.  Now, how much would people pay to make a block?
The reason mining is expensive is because there is a lot of money to be made in it.  Once that drops the cost too will drop.
Ten years ago people were mining Bitcoin with computers.  Today, those same computers are now 10 years old if they still exist.  It was possible to mine bitcoin, and that is, store the blockchain and validate it with a ten year old computer.  That is still true today provided that you increase the storage, which is cheap.
To keep Bitcoin alive all that is required is for many people to host a full node.  The hash rate is secondary.  If people believe in Bitcoin and want to keep it going, then just startup a full node, even on a 5 year old computer, which is dirt cheap to buy if you do not already have one, and run it for however many hours a day you like.  You do not have to do it 24/7 to be useful.  If just 5,000 more people did only that, worldwide, it would go a long way to securing the network.  When you go to sleep, you could turn it on and let it run all night, when you are not using your Internet connection.  Then turn it off during the day when you are.
You do NOT have to compete on hash rate in order to support Bitcoin, keep it secure, and process transactions.  You only have to compete if you want the most rewards for block creation.
The point of Bitcoin is to use it as a currency, (or a store of value if you like); it is not to win block rewards.  Regardless of the block reward, the principles and purpose of Bitcoin still hold true.  **If enough people still believe in that, then it will survive,** and can do so cheaply.
What is your plan to contribute to keeping Bitcoin alive?
@_date: 2019-07-21 05:37:39
If you mean the pending financial crisis, which is just a continuation of the last one that was never resolved, it was created by :  (1) creating too many loans (i.e. debt) that will not be repaid and then selling them to other people.  And by (2) creating even more debt to re-fund, or pay off the bad loans, which results in even more debt to be repaid with yet more interest.
Bitcoin has nothing to do with any of that.  What's more, it is deflationary, rather than inflationary.  The price of Bitcoin may go down, as more people may need to sell in order to cover their budget short falls elsewhere, or due to simply there being fewer buyers; but it will not contribute to causing the crisis.
@_date: 2019-07-28 18:27:13
Baring the obvious worldwide catastrophe to the point where people are more concerned about where their next meal is coming from, than anything on the Internet, I would have to say that a flaw is discovered somewhere in the overall protocol that allows for cheating or faking transactions or double spending, and it cannot be fixed, or not be fixed quickly.
However, I think this is unlikely.
Another scenario would be world governments colluding to make owning it and using it illegal, or limiting its use.  Even though world governments do collude for things in their interests, I do not see where the real benefit to them would be verses the cost to them in time and effort.  It just seems very unlikely due to little motivation.  A more likely scenario in that case would be for Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Cuba, and China agreeing to use it as a currency to use to trade among themselves, because it can be trusted, it cannot be counterfeited, it is easier to trade over boarders, unlike gold, and the cost to store and maintain it is low, again compared to gold.  This would become even more likely if the USA, Canada, GB, and France decided to outlaw it's use.  Would the price drop? Yes.  Would it go to zero?  Probably not, but that would just be a discount to those countries adopting it for trading partners.
Any world power government that tries to stomp it out, will only encourage her enemies to embrace it.  I could even see a government choosing to issue a new currency in their country backed by Bitcoin as an example, instead of gold or silver, as it is much easier to store, protect, and account for than gold or silver.
Of course America's enemies do not want to use the USD, and even the governments that are friendly with the US do not want to be beholding to the USD.  I think it is only a matter of time before all fiat currencies worldwide lose their acceptance between trading partners, especially now since there is an alternative that did not exist before, and it is better than anything previously created by mankind for a worldwide currency.  The more the US tries to force other countries to do their trades with USD, the more push back there will be, and this time they have multiple good alternatives.  I think it is just a matter of time, now that events have been set in motion.
But is there risk?  You bet.  You could lose 95% of the value at some point before it goes back up any appreciable amount.  The question is, can you survive that?  Do not risk more than you can afford to lose, otherwise you are just a gambling fool.

I do not know much about LBC, but it could be because after a certain value of transactions, they are required to obtain ID.  They may be bound to AML, that is Anti Money Laundering regulations.
I have seen this type of info on local BTC ATMs.  I do not remember the exact amounts, though.  For example, below $10,000, no picture ID required, but above that amount they want a picture of you and your picture ID.

No clue.
My unqualified guess is nothing, but I could be wrong if people with cash see it as a safe haven like gold and the number of buyers increases.  As far as I know though, most of the buyers of BTC are people who work for a living, and they will be hurt the most and will not have money available for luxury items like BTC.  
I have not seen any models for, nor arguments for expecting BTC to rise in value due to the crisis.  However, if there is more dollar printing, and inflation, then I would expect BTC to rise ***with*** inflation.
Again, just my unqualified opinion.

Bitcoin does not play around.
The factors in all of this are the amount of work done and the fact that all nodes effectively act independently.  So if one node escapes the isolation and talks to only one node on the other Internet, then it will realize that it is out whack and begin the process of getting back in sync.  And if that one node then can talk to any other node on the isolated network, then the chain reaction will take place causing all of those on the isolated network to re-align.
**Dear god! Bitcoin cannot be stopped.**  It may be delayed, but it cannot be stopped.  Even a simple WiFi network across the border, or hand delivering a hard drive of a node from the non-isolated network could update it in the isolated network.  As long as there is an Internet somewhere, there will be Bitcoin.

True, true.  If you are mostly an importer nation, then it certainly helps to have a strong high value currency.
I have always admired though how the Sterling is more valuable than the dollar, and that Britain was able to maintain that against my poor wimpy dollar.  Also, how Britain kept its own currency and did not marry the Euro.  At least that is the story that I got from a couple of Brits that I asked if they used the Euro or the Pound, and they were both like, "hell no on the Euro.  We use the Pound over here."
Don't worry though, as it looks like the US will be devaluing its dollar again soon.

And another ironic article that in its haste to say that the enemies of cryptocurrency will squash it with their fiat, just make the case for it over fiat, and central banking in general.  The more that central banks try to use heavy handed tactics to assault Bitcoin, et al., the more attention they bring to the the lies of their own products and methods.  
If they think they are king, then it is a kingdom they must protect, but all kingdoms are fragile.  All kingdoms that existed before them have fallen, and they too shall fall.  They have proven the fallacy of their products and methods, otherwise Bitcoin would not even exist, other than as a hobby or an academic exercise.
Bitcoin has no kingdom to defend, nor lose.  It will operate with or without their kingdom.  They can choose Bitcoin as an enemy, or they can choose to adapt and coexist.  Deception, ignorance, and lies cannot defeat Bitcoin, as it exist, uniquely, on the universal truth of mathematics, which cannot be defeated with lies.  Just the 10 year lifetime of Bitcoin alone, already, is better than all fiats before it, in terms of transparency, trust, honesty, efficiency, and worldwide efficacy.  It is this truth that their kingdom of lies fears.  It is only lies that fear truth.  Bitcoin fears none.

1. We are counting on the PoW algorithm to change in the future to reduce cost, but still produce the same results of selecting a single block creator.
2. The cost of mining is currently suffering from typical inflation.  The block reward is still pretty high in value, therefor, there will be much money spent to chase it, as there is much money available.  This makes it hard to compete without spending a lot money.  As the reward for mining comes down, that will reduce the supply of money inflating it, thus the cost will follow suit.  As the cost comes down, then more people will be able to participate, if anything, to provide enough good copies of the blockchain to prevent a 51% attack.  It does not cost a lot to participate and run a full node.  Most can do it with even a 5 or 10 year old computer.  You won't contribute much to the *hash rate*, so you will not be competitive; but you will provide another copy of the blockchain that will make it attack resistant.  You would not even have to run it 24/7.  Just a few hours a day would help.  If Bitcoin is valuable enough to you, I think that would be worth your expense.
You don't buy the inflation argument?  Let me give you an extreme example then.  Supposed I start my own coin which is a copy of Bitcoin, but I configure it so that that each block reward is worth a million dollars.  How much do you think people would be willing to spend to make those blocks?  Now suppose tomorrow the block reward is reduced to $5.  Now how much do you think people will be willing to spend to make those blocks?
The point of Bitcoin is NOT the block reward, but all of the other attributes and principles it supports.  So how much would you pay for that on a yearly basis, by cranking up a used computer to run a full node a few hours a day? $1,200? $600? $300? $100?  The coin is worldwide, so if just 5,000 more people somewhere on the planet, did it, the cost to maintain the network would be low individually as it would be spread among many, and also made secure.  The more that participate, the lower the individual cost and the stronger the coin.  It does not require a high performance computer to store and validate the blockchain.
No such thing as a free lunch, and freedom is not free.

Right now the cost of mining is inflated due to the supply of coins paying for it.  As that drops it will naturally lower the cost, and thus the barrier to entry.
In a way it could become more decentralized.  Due to lower block reward, ( or no block reward ), the mining cost will come down, as it will not be profitable to operate large mining farms.  Thus it makes it more likely that the average person at home can run a single machine mining and thus more distributed.  The take will be less, but so will the cost.  The barrier to entry will drop.
For example, today, I can run a 200 watt computer at home and mine, but I have no hope of actually contributing if am against someone who is running ten machines consuming 1,500 watts each.  But once the reward/cost makes those ten 1,500 watt machines not cost effective, they will be taken out of service.  Due to the lower operating cost of my 200 watt machine, the barrier to entry has been lowered.  If in order to protect the security of BTC, if it means that people will have to run a 200 watt machine for a few hours a day, then there are millions many more people that can do that as compared to the number of people who can get into mining with ten 1,500 watt mining rigs running 24/7.

The only ban of cryptocurrencies that Trump can do is to ban it within his own administration, that is the people that work for him or for the military.  He could ban it for people in the military while they are in the military.
He could try with an executive order for things outside his control, but it would be brought to court and overturned.  The president can only issue executive orders for things that he has control over.  He does not have control over every US citizen.
Congress can pass some kind of law that tries to ban crypto, and the president could sign it, but it would be challenged in court and defeated.  Besides no such law will pass, because whatever the republicans are for the dems are against and vice-versa.  With the divided house of congress right now, nothing like that will pass anyway.

My guess is, the rate of new federal reserve notes being created is greater than the rate of new gold.  Plus there are other countries around the globe that are adding to their stock piles of gold.
Plus the price in gold is manipulated by some traders through the process of selling paper gold.  That is, gold that the buyer does not take deliver of.  If the buyers do not take delivery of their gold, then they can sell more than they actually have.

To calculate the value, as a percent, that it has gained or lost since 1919:
1. 1 - 14.81 = -13.81
2. \-13.81 / 14.81 = -0.932  \* 100 = -93.2%  (positive number here means a gain.  negative means a loss.)
**Your 2019 dollar can now buy 93% LESS than it did in 1919.**

Well it will create inflation, that is, everything you will buy will require more dollars to buy it, and the reason is because dollars are easier to come by, so there is now more dollars available to be spent.  
Bitcoin will probably be impacted by this over the years even if the demand stays the same, but it will not make bitcoin go from 10K to 100K in a year.
Let me give you an example.  Let's say that you have $1,000 to spend each month on making payments on borrowed money.  Maybe that is for a credit card or a mortgage you are about to take out.  Now lets say that interest rates are lowered and now that same $1,000 can afford to borrow more money.  Since there is no end to the things you need to buy you will borrow more with that same $1,000 a month and buy more.  Let's say that allows you buy $50 more per month.  Now let's say that in America there are at least 10 million more people just like you financially.  So they all do the same thing as you and spend $50 more per month.  That now works out to $500 million MORE per month being spent across the nation.  So effectively $500 million new dollars just showed up at retailers cash registers, in the new month that did not even exist in the previous month.
Sales go up.  Retailers say hey, I have so much more sales this month than last month, I need to increase my order to replenish stock, so I can sell again.  Manufactures now have to supply more.  But if all of this new money looking for the same amount of goods, manufacturers will think, wow demand is really up and I am having a hard time keeping up.  I bet I could raise my price and still sell everything I make.  A higher profit margin on the same goods sold.  Life is good.  
Then as prices increase to the point where it becomes profitable for someone else to incur the start up cost of making a new company to sell the same goods, then they do.  This new company needs employees, so now there are new jobs looking for people out of the same size employment pool.  These people leave their old job for a higher paying one or the unemployed now have a job.  These new wages means that more people suddenly have more money to spend, so they start buying again or borrowing again and they spend and interject even more new money into the economy.  And so the cycle repeats until there are no more people to hire and then businesses cannot expand, and since people have borrowed more than before they hit their limit on borrowing and thus spending and do not spend more.   Some will even spend less.  So now if 10 million people spend just $50 less next month that is $500 million dollars that does not make it to retailers.  Thus they buy fewer goods from the manufacture since they have more goods left over at the end of the month.  Then manufactures have to cut back on production, therefore, they need fewer employees, so layoffs start.  When these people become unemployed, their spending drops way down.  Less spending, less retail, less manufacturing and cycle repeats.
Now if the prices are rising too fast, then the Fed can raise interest rates. This means then that more people cannot afford to borrow new money or will borrow less, thus reducing the amount of money people have to spend on goods.  But of course there is a lag on when the fed takes an action and when the effect happens, so the fed is ALWAYS behind.  Things have to get bad or worse before they act, but then they are acting late and it takes time for their corrective action to take effect therefore it gets worse before it gets better, or it gets too good before they pull it back.
Since the 1970s the fed and the federal government has been creating new money every decade that continues to pump up demand and thus costs.  Sure it fluctuates from year to year, but if you draw a trend line from 1970 to today, it will have a positive slope with no hint of going negative.
To give you another example suppose Bitcoin existed in the 1970s.  How much would one cost?  I do not know for sure, but it would be a lot less.  The reason is there were trillions of **fewer** dollars available for everyone to buy **anything** with; therefore, if you were going to make a sale, you better price it so that people can afford it.  
Look at these prices:  [ .  I am old enough to remember the 1970s and these prices seem likely to me for that time.  Of course though, they did not seem cheap at the time.  Compare those to what you would pay today.  Big difference right?  But most people do not noticed until they look back because the price increases were gradual.

1. When you buy at retail you will pay a premium.  That is, a price higher than market price.  That is why they are selling it.
2. Think about what your mission is in buying gold, and then buy the correct stuff from the correct supplier.  Bars, coins, bullion, jewelry, raw.
3. If you wanted to spend or trade your gold later to a wider market then you want bullion gold.  Technically it is legal tender in the US.
4. I do accept gold and silver for services rendered, but I cannot find anyone willing to pay me in gold or silver.
5. When to buy gold is on the dip.  Sounds like you bought on the high.
6. Always ask for what they will buy it for.  Then you know what it is worth before you buy it, and you will know their spread.
7. Some bullion gold you have to notify the the IRS when you sell if you are an American and some you do not.  Consider that before buying bullion.
8. In 1938 minimum wage was 25 cents/hour.  A quarter in 1938 was worth 25 cents.  Today, its melt value is $2.92 and its numismatist value is $20 or more.
9. In India it is customary to pass wealth from one generation to the next through gold jewelry because it is not taxed.
10. Here is a price list from 1970: [  Here is a chart of the price of gold since 1938 and since 1970: [
11. In 1970 a dollar would buy a dollar's worth of goods.  In 2019 a 1 dollar federal reserve note will buy you about 15 cents worth of goods in comparison to 1970: [
12. In 1970 with a dollar you could buy 0.53 troy oz of silver.  Today, a 2019 dollar will get you 0.06 troy oz of silver.
13. The US dollar has its place, gold and silver have their place, stocks and bonds have their place, and cryptocurrencies have their place.  To do the job right requires the right tool for the job.  Choose wisely.

You still think of money, and things, and prices in terms of the 20th century dollar.  You need to start thinking about goods and services and earnings in terms of Bitcoin.  Like, what kind of work and for how many hours would you work to earn a Bitcoin?  What is a Bitcoin worth to you, not in terms of fiat, but in terms of your most precious and scarce resource?  That is, your time, your talents, your skills, your abilities before you grow too old to use them anymore.
You cling to your worthless fiat, and complain that Bitcoin is not a government controlled monopoly.  The very thing that gives Bitcoin its greatest value and you complain about it.
Get out of the rut of one dimensional thinking.  Let's expand your horizon.  What if the order of invention was the other way around?  What if man had invented Bitcoin first, and then your government comes along and says, this is no good?  But do not worry, because we can replace this citizen owned money with cheap, government controlled fiat money that will enslave and rob you of everything you ever produce and own.  Is that what you want to vote for?  Is that what you want to exchange your Bitcoin for?

Your understanding is off a bit.
I do not know what you mean by "larger" - usage, price, market cap, developers, popularity?
The reason the difficulty is going up is because there are more miners.  The reason there are more miners is because:
1. The coin is becoming more widely known, thus the size of the population of people who have the propensity to mine grows with it.
2. It is profitable if it is done right.
It is profitable because of the incentive to mine, which is currently inflationary.  That is, there is a lot of reward still chasing miners.  However as the block reward decreases over time, miners will be pushed out economically, and the hash rate will drop, and thus, so will the difficulty.
But if the price-climb outpaces the block reward decline, then there will still be much gain to support high hash rates.  For example, if the block rewards becomes 1 BTC, but the price is $1 million per BTC, and a miner could be assured of getting one BTC a day, then it is safe to say that a miner could afford to spend several hundred thousand dollars a day to chase that million.
But, if the coin price declines it becomes more affordable to more people, thus demand can increase.
In these areas of price, mining reward, and difficulty, it is self regulating.
There is still a lot more room for the Bitcoin market, that is, user base to grow.

Okay.  I see how they are using the word.
This is accurate usage of the word.  They described it, but did not define it.  I'll define it here.
An account is a distinct grouping of a cryptocurrency's addresses for receiving/sending the currency, which are all under the control of a single entity or domain.
For example, I may have two accounts in my wallet, which account for 15 addresses.  One account has 5 addresses and the other has 10 addresses.  If I spend from the second account, the coins can only come from the 10 addresses in it, and not all 15.
To often though I see people use inaccurate terms to describe things in the cryptocurrency world, which results in more confusion.

Many people struggle to understand abstract concepts.
Intrinsic Values of Bitcoin:
1. It is virtually impossible to counterfeit.
2. It can only be made through work and expenditure of resources.
3. Its supply is scarce and finite.
4. It is the first currency or monetary system that is more profitable to play by the rules of the system, than it is to violate the rules of the system.
5. Thousands of times a day its ledger is audited and invalid transactions are instantly removed or blocked.
6. It operates in all countries of the world without the need or expense of any state or national government or national banking system.
7. The rules, cost, and effort is the same if you are sending it to a person on the other side of the planet, or sitting right next to you.
8. It has more reliable uptime than any other clearing house, or monetary exchange system in all of human history; and it rises every year.
9. It cannot be diluted by mixing it with other metals.
10. Regardless of the amount that one wants to store, the cost is orders of magnitude cheaper and more efficient than any previous legacy system.
That is just the first ten that immediately come to mind.
No other previous monetary system comes close to having any of these intrinsic values, while Bitcoin has all of these values, which are intrinsic to its design and function.

Go to the [IRS.gov]( website and look at the documentation there for how to handle reporting to the IRS for when you sell it.
They treat it as virtual property that is an investment, which means you may have a capital gain or loss when you exchange it for something else.  That is if you sell it or buy something with it.
Since you inherited it, I would guess that your cost basis is its value the day you inherited it.  For example, if you inherited a house worth a million dollars, and then you sold it the next day for a million, your cost is a million so there is no profit for tax purposes.

Maybe these bonds will be convertible into stocks later, but at a higher rate.  I can't finger out how a corporate bond is a better deal than the stock itself.

There are multiple aspects in play here.
1. Honest nodes will reject transactions and blocks that contain lies.  They also do not propagate these lies.
2. The honest nodes stop communicating with the lying nodes.  Every time a bad node lies to an honest node, the bad node gets more and more isolated.  This isolation creates a fork in a way.  One that is honest and easy to find, one that is only talking to itself and not part of the honest node network.
3. Because bitcoin's truth is so distributed it is likely that an attacker is concentrated and centralized.  This centralization will be physically localized which will make it easier to attack them back, (think DDoS), or cut them off from the Internet at the ISP level or go to their building and cut the power or Internet connection.
4. They will have to maintain their majority for a long time, at an enormous cost.  We are talking about many machines, and infrastructure, power, cooling, networking, 10,000 of square feet of office building type space, and the personnel to set it up and maintain it.  The first slight hiccup that drops them below the majority and everything they have committed goes to waste.  While it is possible to do a 51% attack, in order for it to succeed though, it has to be maintained for several blocks.  This is extremely costly and unlikely to be maintained.
5. Even if it was successful, it is not like robbing bank tellers where you are in and out in 120 seconds.  It is more like setting up your own bank branch of an already known bank like Bank of America and thinking that you going to be able to maintain this ruse long enough to be profitable, and that you will be able to get out before someone who knows better discovers your ruse.  Even if you get away with it, it will not last long.  It is a high risk venture and the longer you do it the more likely you are going to get busted and perhaps dealt with outside of the law.
6. It is cheaper and more profitable to just mine bitcoin honestly.

The non-correlated part means that the price moves independent of other markets.  If the DOW goes up, it does not influence the price of Bitcoin up or down.
However, when the demand for stocks, widely, goes down, the demand for things like bonds and gold goes up.  When the demand for stocks goes up, the demand for bonds and gold goes down.  The price movement in stocks correlates to the price movement in bonds and gold, but in an opposite direction.
The asymmetric part just means that the price movement of Bitcoin is not equal to that of other asset classes.  That is, just because the DOW goes down 5% it does not mean that BTC will go up 5% in response.  Likewise, if BTC goes up 25% in a day, you will not see a price movement of some other asset class moving the same percentage.
Similarly, there used to be a high correlation between BTC and LTC.  If BTC went up 5%, then so did LTC.  They used to move in tandem in the same hour and often times near the same percentage amount, but this year BTC has been moving in amounts and directions different than her sibling and cousin coins.
Lately, I been seeing BTC go up by $800 and LTC will go down by $2 in the same time frame.  Now it usually takes about a $1000 move up in BTC, before LTC is dragged along with it.  It seems that BTC is breaking out into its own asset class, such that so you cannot predict price movement or magnitude by what some other asset classes do.  It does not seem to have a relationship with other asset classes.

So what do you think the cause is?
@_date: 2019-08-03 04:31:28
I think it's intrinsic value is 
1. that it is virtually impossible to counterfeit.
2. Fraud is very easy to detect.
3. The greater the distance between the sender and the receiver, the more efficient and cheaper the transaction is versus fiat.
4. The barrier is low to participate.  It uses ubiquitous technology that almost anyone can use.  It does not require expert or highly trained professionals to setup a home unit for mining or a full node operation.  (Perhaps this point is debatable, but people are working on lowering the barrier even more.)
5. It does not require permission, nor a license to operate, have, or use.  (Speaking about the US.)
6. The paradigm shift that it embodies makes banks virtually obsolete.
7. Its border friction is equal to that of the Internet.  (Sorry, I know this sentence is awkward, but I am using "border" as an adjective here.)
8. When stored *properly*, it is virtually impossible to steal or lose, and it has the lowest storage cost of any legacy currency.
9. Its accuracy of accounting is unmatched, by any other legacy currency system.  I mean by orders of magnitude.  (Maybe this is debatable, so strike it from the list if you disagree.)
I cannot think of any other currency invented to date that, intrinsically, has more than one of these attributes.

You could try an experiment.  Get a known legit gold bar from a local dealer and get him to explain to you why he thinks it is not fake.  Then go order the same bar from ebay, which I hear is a good source for such fakes.  Then compare them.  I bet you will be able to tell more quickly than you think you can.
Or better yet just get a bar from the most shady looking seller on ebay and take it to the shop and see if you can compare it to a known good bar just like it.
I agree with what you are saying, and in theory it sounds great, but doing it for real is going to be a lot harder than it sounds to get the weight just right vis-a-vis the volume.   I think it will be a lot of work, and hard to do in a large enough volume.  This additional amount of work will make it not profitable.  That is the effort will simply be too much for the reward.  Remember, criminals are lazy and always looking for a short cut.  They are usually not good at doing disciplined work.
Also, one would need virtually pure platinum and tungsten, and not the scrap kind, and not the alloy.  Alloys of these types are usually magnetic, however, gold is not magnetic at all.  Platinum is not very usable as a metal in its pure form and is usually in alloy form.  Not to mention platinum and tungsten have very high melting temperatures, so if one is going to melt it and pour it or shape it, then there is going to be a serious cost involved in equipment and skill of operation.
The specific gravity test is going to be really hard to beat.  Specific gravity takes into account weight, density, **and** volume with respect to another known pure substance, such as water.  If any one of those three items is out of margin, then the test will tell it.  It is not just measuring one factor like other tests do.
Also, the larger the gold bar, the larger the error will be, making it more likely to be easily detected.
Have you ever seen or heard of an instance where the gold bar had this combination of tungsten and platinum inside of a gold shell, but it weighed as expected?  I have not, which is why I ask.  All of the fakes that I have seen in person or on youtube are clearly out of bounds in either weight, dimension, or volume, and can be detected with common tools.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:05:15
Yes, if you have a large volume to do, then you will need more efficient tools.  
I have seen tungsten adulterated gold bars and coins and when measured against known quantities that the fakes were to represent, the difference in dimension, volume, or weight was obvious.
I was in a guys shop who trades coins and precious metals and he had some on display.  Someone had brought them into his shop to sell.  He spotted them in his testing and the guy selling them did not believe him.  He got permission to prove it by breaking them in two.  He uses them as educational tools and periodically does a training seminar to show people how to spot tungsten fakes.
He says he will not buy anything that is in a case that cannot be taken out of and directly inspected.  He says he frequently sees faked assaying and authentication holograms.  He trusts none of them.  He prefers to rely on physics.
There are many videos on youtube that show how to determine real from fake gold without using expensive equipment.  Again, tungsten is close, but not close enough.

Thanks, OP, and sorry for your loss.
Yes, red flags all over your story.  "carries $40K in cash in the car", "phone is always low on power"?  Sounds like someone clearly does not have his act together and someone I would avoid in real life from the start.  My phone is never low, nor am I ever without some charging ability.  If I have $40K in my car I am probably going to be able to have a phone charger in the car too, since my phone is how I make big crypto deals.  And someone who does carry $40K in their car on the way to a crypto deal with someone they have never met before, and then tells them about it, just sounds stupid as fuck.
My take away from this story is to establish the conditions for the exchange ahead of time.  A contract if you will.  If the conditions change in mid flight then the deal is off and escape to safety immediately.
All good pilots go through a preflight before take off.  The rule is, if the pilot is being rushed or has to alter the preflight, then cancel the flight, because that is exactly how deadly mistakes are created.  Rushing the preflight and making unplanned changes in flight is a recipe for disaster.  I think the same principle applies to selling crypto.

It is a function of supply and demand.
The supply of Bitcoin is fixed, but the demand is currently small in comparison to the demand that it could have.  For example, let's say right now 10 million people have some Bitcoin, but next year if the desire for people to possess and use Bitcoin goes to 1 billion people, they are going to have to get it from the same supply as the current 10 million.  Also note that 21 million Bitcoin divided among a billion people is way less than 1 Bitcoin per person.
I cannot explain it well in a reddit comment, but do an Internet search for: explain supply and demand pricing.

@_date: 2019-10-07 22:38:03
EDIT:  below has been proven to be false, although at the time of this writing unlikely, so I seek to remove it.
1. I use a 64 bit computer that was made in 2008 and it can only take 4GB of RAM.  I would probably have to pay someone to take it if I wanted to get rid of it, and mine works just fine.  **Also, note that this computer is older than Bitcoin itself.**
2. I upgraded the HD to a WD Black 1TB for $75.
3. Loaded Ubuntu LTS version on it for free.
4. My ISP does not meter, which is why I use them, but once the initial block load is done the bandwidth consumed is very small.  You can also control how many peers it will talk to which will further limit bandwidth usage.  It is such a small amount that I do not have to turn it off to use my Internet connection for anything else.  My Internet speed is 20Mbs down and 2Mbs  up.
5. I monitor its electricity usage and it cost me about $81 a year to run it 24/7 but I don't.
6. I also use it as a SOCKS5 proxy too, so it is going to be on most the time anyway.
7. I have not tried it yet but you could probably get a computer capable of being a full node for $100 from either a pawn shop or the flea market and it would be more powerful than the one I use now.
8. If $200 is too tight on one's budget for a full bitcoin node, then one should really just focus on getting one's income earning ability up and not be concerned about silly post on reddit.  Just sayin.
9. ~~To defend against a 51% attack, miners mean nothing.  It is the full validating nodes that preserve the integrity since they store and validate the blockchain.  The more of these there are, the stronger the integrity of Bitcoin.~~
10. One does not have to run it 24/7 either.  It can be run when one sleeps so as not to interfere with normal usage.  Also, if one's Internet connection is metered, just run for a few hours a day until it catches up when doing the initial block load.  Because my computer is so slow by today's standards, mine took 10 days for the initial block download.  Once it got about 25% downloaded it spent more time verifying transactions than it did downloading, so the bandwidth it needed dropped way down by an order of magnitude or more.  The first day though it was maxing out my Internet connection, but again this was for a short period of time.
11. If on a metered Internet connection just pay the additional fee for that one month, or use less Internet until the initial block download is done.  It is not something that encumbers one the rest of one's life.

Since my machine is so old and limited on RAM, I just set it up without a gui and do everything command line.  I only connect to it via SSH.  It does not even have a mouse, keyboard, or monitor connected to it.

In my opinion the threat of a 51% attack is virtually non-existent.  Sure it is theoretically possible, but it is economically infeasible.  Let me tell you why.
For a 51% attack to be successful, otherwise what is the point in doing it at all, one must obtain either enough hardware to increase the number of validating nodes to 51%, or be able to hack 51% of existing nodes.  Validating nodes are nodes that just validate transactions and store a copy of the audited and validated blockchain.  They do not mine blocks.  I run one and it cost me about $81/yr in electricity and I run it on an 11 year old computer.
Second, one would also need to have enough hardware, or to be able to hack 51% of everyone else's mining nodes.  Clearly, a costly endeavor or highly unlikely to hack that many miners.
Third, once the two seemingly impossible things above happen, one would now need to sustain this hold without getting caught because he would need to create more than 1 block in order to create the longest chain.  This tasks seems even more impossible than the previous two.
Forth, because validating nodes remember who sends them invalid blocks and transactions, they stop talking to the violator.  This will quickly isolate the offending systems leaving them only talking to themselves.  There will be still many copies of the good, valid blockchain on the network and all still working together; therefore, if the offending system ever slips up and drops below 51% it will be over taken.
Fifth, invalid transactions and blocks are very easy to detect, so such a massive onslaught would be quickly detected and existing good miners and validating node people would spring into action to defend the good systems.  Where ever the offending system is, it will probably be concentrated to one or a few locations and networks, and someone will simply pull the network plug on it, or the power plug.  There are enough IT people in bitcoin around the globe to the point that within an hour or two of getting the word out, that someone with the ability and will to create a barrier for the offending system will do so.
With six degrees of separation I guarantee that somebody knows someone somewhere that within 6 emails or phone calls the conversation will go something like this: "Hey we are seeing a 51% attack on bitcoin coming from IP ranges such-n-such.  Can you work your magic on the network and send those packets to /dev/null for a couple of hours?"  And boom, just like that, no more 51%, whether it happened accidentally, or "accidentally" on purpose.  This would be true if the attack was coming from South America, China, Hong Kong, Russia, or North America.  IT networking engineers and operators know their same counter part around the globe.
Sixth, to have any hope of sustaining such an attack would require significant decentralization or distribution.  If concentrated geographically, then that is easy to locate and kill either through networking isolation or electrical power isolation.  Just the cost of coordination and logistics of timing and managing so many willing people to do it in a distributed fashion seems virtually impossible to me.  It would take hundreds if not thousands of people around the globe, who speak different languages, and willing to work together on such a costly and short lived endeavor.  I just do not see human nature being able to do that without getting caught long enough for it to succeed.
Bitcoin is successful for many reason, not just one, but one of the biggest is because it is more profitable to play by the rules, than to try and get away with violating them.

While I agree with your sentiment, you are taking some liberties there when you said they did it to devalue everyone's USD.  The purpose is to lower the cost of new money in an effort to increase demand on goods and services.  The devaluing is just a side effect, not the purpose.
For example, when I go outside and crank up my lawn mower and mow the grass, it is not because it is too quiet outside.  The noise is just a side effect of the process.

Tungsten is close, but not close enough.  If tungsten is used then the size will be different enough, or the weight will be different enough to be noticed.
Gold has a specific weight to volume ratio that is impossible to duplicate with anything else.  One can measure its weight, dimensions, and volume and compare that to the expected results.  Depending on the size, the volume can be easily measured by placing it in a known volume of water.
The way people are getting fooled with gold covered tungsten is that they are not doing proper inspections before taking possession.

@_date: 2019-06-23 21:39:33
First of all, Bitcoin is successful.  I would call something with $193 billion dollar market capitalization with no debt and no end in sight a success.
Second, Bitcoin is a currency, but a very young currency and it works differently than all other currencies created before it.  It takes people time to wrap their heads around it, because it lives in the abstract.  Deep in the abstract.
It is also a paradigm shift, that people are trying to understand.  The knee jerk way to understand something is to relate it to something else that is already understood.  The so-called money channels like bloomberg and cnbc only think in terms of stocks, bonds, commodities, dollars, and old designs of "money", so that is how they think of it and talk about it.  Then sheeple hear this and their brain makes the same connections.
It is like the saying that if you are a hammer, then all of your problems are nails.  Now introduce a screw to a hammer...
I do look forward to the day though when people start thinking in terms of BTC or LTC, (if I am allowed to say LTC in here), instead of dollars, or their local currency.  But until we can pay our taxes in BTC, people will still think of things in terms of $ instead of BTC.  To put a finer point on it, even dollars do not exist.  In the US they are federal reserve notes.  There is no such thing as a dollar.  When dollars were replaced with notes, people still called them dollars out of habit because they looked mostly the same, and worked the same from their point of view.  **BTC does not look the same, nor work the same as any prior existing currency or money.**
So, what **is** it like, so that I can understand it?  That's the problem.  It is not really **like** anything before it.  It is so novel and unique that it could not even exist before the Internet, or even computers, or even advanced mathematics.  I can explain to you **what** it is, but none of the concepts that it is built upon are trivial or axiomatic, thus it requires a certain higher level of intelligence understand it, much less just grasp it in concept.
The 'US dollar' is going down in value faster than it ever has before, with no end to its devaluation in sight.  BTC on the other hand is the anti-dollar.  Even without being accepted as payment for federal taxes, it is still going up in value, just like stocks.  It has value because it offers us options and features like no other money before it, while at the same time eliminating/preventing the problems of its predecessors.
It is just the next iteration of currency, nay!, money.  It is a paradigm shift that the current kingdoms do not fully understand yet, because most of their brain is already full of the legacy ways of doing things, with little room for the future.
The only real risk in Bitcoin is:
1. That it is the prototype and thus being the first it is easy to iterate beyond it.  (Compare the model T Ford to cars of today.)
2. It threatens all existing hegemonies.

I PM'ed you what to do with the first one.
Store a second one at work if you have an office.  Store it in something personal, but not valuable, so that if you leave or get fired you can then take it with you, but since it is not valuable no one would want to steal it.  Perhaps a lamp and put your name on it.  I have a junk drawer in my office that I put stuff like that in, cause who wants to look for valuables in a junk drawer?  I keep a spare key to my house there too.
Also, never put it in a safe deposit box in a bank.  You are NOT the only one who has access to it.  The bank can access it, the government can, and bank robbers can.  Safe deposit boxes only keep out the honest people.

I have up-voted your comment due its correctness and to the effort and respect that you have made in it.
In the scenario that you mention, my earlier reasons would not apply, I agree with you.  You have laid asunder my comment.
And what is most troubling about the scenario is that the perpetrator would be able to essentially double spend.  Even if you recorded the original transaction and resubmitted it, it would then be seen as an invalid transaction if they had moved the coin to another address, so then you would be without your coin for sure.  Of course this would give you legal recourse since you would have evidence of the original intent with the original transaction, but this does mean more effort on your part to get legal remedy.
*Are there any statistics on the number of times that two or more miners find the same block before a second block is created, causing one of them to be "replaced" and orphaning valid transactions?*  I am just curious as to the incident rate of this.
Perhaps another solution, if economically feasible, would be to keep transactions in the mempool until they are 3 or 6 blocks deep.  The second double-spend transaction would then be able to be detected and invalidated would it not?  I am not sure how much this would extend the size of the mempool, so it may not be practical.
And I would also like to take the opportunity to piggy-back on your scenario as proof that Bitcoin is not a trust-less system.  Your comment proves that we all trust the miners to a significant degree to do their part non-maliciously.  Even if I too am a miner, I still have to win the block with my preferred transactions, which is clearly very difficult to ensure this in a usable time frame.  I can validate my own transactions all day long, but I cannot force it into a block without cost prohibitive expense.

@_date: 2019-06-25 17:37:35
Your first problem is your point of reference.  You are, perhaps, thinking in terms of dollars and converting, instead of thinking in what is a bitcoin worth to the proprietor.
People in Europe do not think in terms of dollars and convert to Euros; they think in terms of Euros.  In Great Britain they think in terms of Pound Sterling, not Euros.
Once cryptocurrencies become more popular over fiat currency, then things will be priced in bitcoin, litecoin, etc.  All fiat currencies are guaranteed to lose value over time.  Instead, think of things in terms of real money such as gold, silver, bitcoin, etc., and you will have a whole new perspective.
The US dollar only has value because it is the only thing that Americans can pay their federal taxes with.  If that ever changes, no one will care about dollars anymore.
The US dollar is volatile too.  It is now rapidly going down in value.  My source:  Bitcoin and gold are going up in value at a more rapid rate, even though the supply is increasing.  More and more people would rather hold gold or bitcoin now than US dollars.  The US dollar is for suckers.
Your question should be, when will the dollar stabilize and stop its steady decline in value?
The federal reserve note, what you call a dollar, has only been around since 1913, so that is 106 years.  In that time it has lost 98% of its original value.  In contrast, bitcoin is about 10 years old and its value has a positive slope, that is an upward trend, since its inception.

Maybe this will help:
If you still know the address(es) that the coins were sent to when mined you could use one of those blockchain info sites to get a list of the outputs.  I think the time and date are also recorded.  Then perhaps you can use that to get a day's value for that day.  Surely there is some website that will give you daily prices in the past, yes?
Does Canada have some rule for what happens when you buy something, have a record of it and the value, but those records get destroyed through no fault of your own, such as a fire, or natural disaster?  If so, maybe that applies to you.

Your understanding of taxable events in crypto needs some work.
A taxable event is when you trade crypto for something else, anything else;  that is fiat money, for someone to mow your lawn, for a car, for a house, or for a lap dance.  If you transfer ownership of the crypto to someone else, then you are required to calculate the capital gain or loss of the crypto based upon the difference of its value at the time you traded it versus the cost to acquire it.
For example if you bought a bitcoin for a dollar, then the price goes up to $1001.00, and then you traded (ie. spent) that bitcoin for cocaine and hookers, you have realized a profit of $1000.  You must now pay taxes on that $1000 of realized gains.  You realized those gains when you spent it, NOT when you held it.
Another example, if you buy bitcoin at a dollar, and the price goes to $250,000, then your tax liability is zero, because you still own it and have not traded it for anything.

1. As long as there is a network and electricity, there is Bitcoin.
2. No government or bureaucrat can cancel your transaction, block it, or confiscate it without your permission.
3. It operates independently of all banking and financial institutions.  When Wells Fargo, MasterCard, and Visa had world wide outages for hours, Bitcoin was 100% functional.
4. Bitcoin makes all banks **obsolete.**  Why do you need a bank when you have Bitcoin?  A bank is the most expensive way to manage money.
5. There are fake dollars, there are fake Euros, there is fake gold.  No one can give you fake Bitcoin.
6. It is the cheapest and most efficient store of value and it will never have a negative interest rate.
7. It can only be created through honest work, and it has a finite limit; thus, its value cannot be destroyed through inflation.
8. It is more cost effective and profitable to follow the rules of Bitcoin than to try and cheat and violate them.
9. Bitcoin is not a debt to be repaid.  It is not an empty promise of future work.  It is proof that work has already been done.
Then let them ask questions.  People learn by asking questions that interest them.  The teacher leads them to those types of questions.
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:25:00


That is because you acquired something of value.  It needs to be determined though if it is considered income or investment dividend, or something else.  Because that will determine the tax rate.
1.  I think an argument can be made though that the airdrop was not acquired at zero cost.  For example if you only get the airdrop if you own bitcoin, then you had to acquire bitcoin at some cost.  Thus that is your cost for acquiring the airdrop.
2.  Also, I would like to argue that airdrops are gifts, and that gifts are tax free up to the limit.  I do not remember the exact gift limit, but I think it is like $13K or $15K a year.  A gift is a value that you receive without obligation.  That is, you didn't do anything to acquire the gift.
In the case of the airdrop you did not do anything to get it, it just happened.  You were not obligated to do anything of value in order to receive it.  You do not owe anyone anything for receiving it.  Sounds like a gift to me.
Just some more food for thought.

You need more clarity on the word, "decentralized".
It is true that bitcoin is decentralized, but the mining is less decentralized than the full node deployments due to economics.
The barrier to entry on a full node is very low in comparison.  I made one for the purchase of $75 for a new hard drive and put it in a computer, that I already had, that is older than bitcoin itself.  Even used a free operating system.  She is running fine.  For a little bit more you buy one turn-key.  All you have to do is plug it in and turn it on.
The barrier to entry to do mining is higher and more esoteric, due to cost and knowledge of setup and operation; however, one does not need permission from anyone to do it.  Because of this, it is decentralized in that way.  Essentially anyone who wants to, can put in the effort to either join an existing mining pool, or start their own.  You do not need permission to do this.  There is mining on just about every continent on the planet.  Maybe even all of them by now.
Now having said that, someone will say, yeah but you can't in country such-n-such because blah blah.  Well obviously I am not talking about those places, since there are many other places on the planet that you do not need permission from people with guns to do it.  Just the resources.
Now contrast this with setting up your own public-serving bank, or better yet a central bank.  The barrier to entry is at least in the millions if not billions, requires employees, permission and scrutiny from a countless number of bureaucratic government entities and a mountain of regulation knowledge and compliance.   You can't just wake up one day and say, hey I think I will open my own bank this afternoon and get away with it.  That is definitely NOT decentralized.
Any one person can do it at anytime if they are willing to commit a few resources, and the more one commits, the more one does.  And by "any one", I mean one person can do it.  It does not require a team of people with advanced degrees and six figure salaries to do it.

This does bring up a good question about what to do in the case of a multi-sig wallet.

Usually for someone to send you some bitcoin you will need to provide the sender with your public address to receive the coin.  If you are going to use the wallet on your smart phone for example, then you would have it display your public address QR code and the seller would scan that.
Since I have never used localcoinswap I cannot say what role they play in it, but I would assume they would have some kind of tutorial or explanation at their site that would explain how the seller initiates the transfer.
Since you contacted the seller through the site, he/she may already have the destination via the site, that is, your account with the web site.
An escrow, or an escrow account is when two parties use a third neutral party to help facilitate a transaction.  For example, seller may place the product under control of the escrow agent and the buyer places the funds under the control of the same escrow agent.  When both parties signal that they are satisfied with terms and method of the transaction, then the escrow agent releases the product to the buyer, and the funds to the seller and the exchange is complete.  If at anytime before the transaction starts, either party can cancel the transaction and each party has returned to him what he was offering.
The risk here without an escrow is that if you give the cash money to the seller he could just gets up and leave not send the bitcoin.  Seller may escrow his part, but I do not know how you would escrow the cash without the escrow agent present.
Cash and bitcoin do not play well together.  The physical world does not play well with the ether world.
Good luck.
@_date: 2019-09-13 22:25:57
As the buyer you really are taking on the brunt of the risk, especially if it is from someone you do not know.  Whether that is a lawn mower, bitcoin, or a car.
If you must use cash and it is too risky, then you might try a bitcoin meet up or swap meet.  I have never seen one, but that would seem less risky and you can see other people do deals perhaps to get a feel for the seller.

final answer.

Not sure.
Check the sellers reputation.  I assume the site has a reputation score.
Use the escrow service of the web site and convert the cash into a form that they can escrow.
Don't risk losing more than you can afford to lose.
Do the exchange in a public place where there are cameras to record the faces and the transaction of the parties.
In my county, the sheriff has a place where people can meet at a sheriff's office and do the exchange with camera surveillance and deputies around in case something goes wrong.  People use it for craig's list exchanges and the like.  Could be used for crypto too.   Some think that if the person is not willing to meet you at the local sheriff's office, outside on the bench, then maybe you should not meet the person anywhere, ever.
Others also suggest to take a friend who can be present away from you to view the situation from a different angle and to appear as to not be in on the exchange.  Perhaps the friend can inconspicuously record video from a distance.
I'd take a picture of the cash to record the serial numbers and show when you had it in your possession.  Store a copy of the pic off your phone too, in case it gets lost or stolen during the transaction.  If he runs off with the money you can file a police report with an accurate description of the money stolen.  If they catch a suspect he can be searched for the money with the same serial numbers.
As the ultimate disclaimer says:  Let the buyer beware.

I will add, that the scenario you are talking about is way off into the future.  We will probably all be dead before this event becomes a problem.
Also, Bitcoin may be replaced with something else that is yet to be invented, just like all previous currencies.
Your concern is valid, but most likely not during your lifetime, nor the next generation's life time.
Two other possible solutions come to mind though.
1. If the consensus is to change the code, then say perhaps that a certain number of bitcoins can be 'remined' from defunct addresses that have not had the private key used, in say, 150 years.  Those addresses then may need to be blocked somehow, in code, from ever sending those coins.  Or they may not need to be blocked since there will be new people losing access to their private key and thus losing coins again.  The way these coins can be identified is based upon private key usage, the code could just allow for new coins to be mined again.  For example, if a million coins are at addresses that have not had the private key used in the last 150 years, then a new million can be mined.
2. Another way may be to have everyone send/move their coins to a new address scheme by a certain date.  Something that will distinguish old lost private keys from the new ones.  Then mining can switch over to guessing the private keys of the old, left-behind addresses.  Into the future, when this will be needed, perhaps computing power will be such that it will be feasible to guess old private keys say in a month, a year, or 2 or 5, or so.  If it is worth the payoff, someone will do it.  Once the private keys are found those coins can then be moved to the new address scheme by whoever finds them and thus they will be back into circulation.
