There are a lot of implication of this that I'm considering not only social but also economical in a broader sense. 


You are right but I think the aim need instruments not the opposite.

This is a question not directly to the Counterparty team:
Is there some simple article that explain Counterparty ethereum script system? And comment it thoughtful?
In particular I want to understand why this system can't be implemented also on coloredcoin or other system, for free: without the need to buy XCP, of pay XCP fees.

This is without any sense. We are talking about paper for contract, only with a specified syntax, nothing more, paper have to bee free, you [*already*]( pay for storing data in the blockchain, and OP_RETURN it's allowed now.


In fact, I would argue that everyone saying "Bitcoin for everything is the way to go!" is suffering from the exact same "moral hazard" in the opposite direction.
This is really really alarming from you seems you can't distinguish a commodity, that base its value on scarcity and work to extract it (that determinate its minimum value), from contracts! I really suspect that this isn't possible, and you simply see a possibility of the same *right* arguments against ethereum and you react with a conditioned reflex or maybe with a more strategical anticipation of the critique. Anyway I don't think this apply also to ethereum because it's evident what do you say, to thrive a currency have to be a little self-interested, it's normal! But, honestly, not if that currency born from a real distributed network.
At least you say this here:

This [excerpt]( from a previous article from the same author convalidate my thesis, and you doesn't answer my questions.
It's true, I'm not the best people in the world to understand and speak english, but I completely doesn't get this phrase:

What are you talking about?!?!?!


Yes, effectively also the article refer to this as:


I use it sometimes and I remember high fee one time, but not recently...
I don't get at all why I have to pay more only to use a feature of bitcoin that already have a fee cost "laws", can you explain this to me with references? Anyway this is not the point, it only became all more crazy with this "strange" fees, I'm just curious about this craziness, but the situation in paying to use a bitcoin feature like OP_RETURN (that I can use for free with CoinSpark) doesn't make any sense at all...

Isn't this an old news?

Do you think it's really necessary a precolored coin to color a coin or it's just speculation? Do you write an answer on [this]( (This question is referred to counterparty before script language integration)
I get that know the situation change because you have to pay for the execution of the contract, but also there, why no using bitcoin...

I have the same [question]( I'd also like an article on this.
EDIT: Chakra_Scientist change the question, the original one is:


I upvote that question. In other words, why we need XCP?

An interesting idea explained in the second subtitle here  is that if these virtual currency become insta exchangable with others corporate issued one - and this is very likely - they will become an actual currency like usd or euro! Probably this is the pathway for first private currency diffusion, if we classify btc and similar nonsupplycontrollable as a commodity, not a currency.

Thanks to link me the Todd's point of view, he works also on Mastercoin that is a similar "contracts for sale style" system. I don't like this approach, I definitely like to listen to some other voices.
