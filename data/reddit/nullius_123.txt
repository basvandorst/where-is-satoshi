The point is a good one - new tech is almost always viewed with suspicion or even contempt at the beginning. Moreover, new technologies tend to take a few decades to become widely adopted (one theory has it that new tech only really takes off once women adopt it). This timeframe is reducing somewhat with newer tech, but as we can see, BTC has been with us for a decade now, and it still has a way to go before we see mass adoption - only 3 million wallets, worldwide, have more than $1,000 of BTC in them (even at today's price).

Welcome! 
Firstly, spend some time with Andreas - 
He is one of the world's best educators on Bitcoin, and has quite a bit to say on the question of wallet selection.
If you have less than $500 in BTC, you might consider using a service like Coinbase vault or Blockchain.info - but whenever you use anything online, use 2FA (not text messages) for extra security. As a rule, do not leave your coins on an exchange unless you are trading them. Best practice is to move them to a wallet that you control.
If you have, or are going to have, more than $500 in BTC, then definitely get a hardware wallet - Ledger or Trezor are the gold standard gadgets. 
Once you have more than a grand or two in BTC, I would also recommend buying a clean computer that you *only use for crypto*, which has no software or add-ons installed (except what you need to manage your assets), and which is almost never online.

Counterparty risk on an 18-month maturity, in such an illiquid market, is very high, even with puts on the other side of the order sheet. For most of us who want to go long - Hodlers - much more secure to just buy a Bitcoin now and hang on to it. Yes, you do have to find some capital now rather than later, but if you're buying options without the capital to cover them then you're asking for trouble.

Don't worry too much about the paper loss - you can carry that loss for tax purposes (in the US at least), which means if you sell your BTC in the future you can reduce your tax burden a bit. You'll still have roughly the same amount of BTC as you did on RH, but this time you'll actually own them! 
1 - Learn about the system and choose a wallet. Spend some time with AA - 
2 - Open an account with one of the larger exchanges if you can. This is where you'll get the best exchange rate.

Good point here. Sooner or later word will get out: you own some Bitcoin. You (and your loved ones) thus become a potential target of the $5 Wrench Attack. How to defend against this? 
It seems to me that the best way is to make it clear to those that know you're into crypto that your private keys are held securely somewhere that will require some time to retrieve, and that the retrieval will be recorded. In my case, this means the (encrypted) keys are in a safe deposit box *in another country*. If my stack grows much more, I'll use three sites, and divide the keys (seed) between them, with any two portions being sufficient. 
Just as a fiat rich person wouldn't keep all their cash in the house, we shouldn't keep our bags at home either. Bad practice.

Your "limited role" is in fact total domination. Unless the government has a (domestic) monopoly on violence, it will be overrun. 
Look at those countries where the government is weak ("limited") and the murder rate is very high, like Mexico. With so many killings, it is impossible to bring many perpetrators to justice. You can literally get away with murder in Mexico. Why? Because the government is under resourced and does not really have a *monopoly* on violence - the gangs are very powerful. 
I'd rather have strong government *that is answerable to the public*.

The merger of state interests and corporate interests (or the takeover of state functions by corporations) is a key feature of totalitarianism. In such a world (like, say China, or Russia, or...) the apparatus of freedom and democracy can still exist, but it ceases to mean much. They vote in North Korea, and have newspapers, but no one calls that free, or a democracy.

Noelle Acheson has a good piece on this - 
The recent rise in the price of BTC may be the result of some whales bidding up the price before Monday when we could see a lot of selling of cheap futures. That would pull the plug out of this rally. 
On the other hand, rich investors who do not own BTC could buy longs and clean up if the price holds. 
We really need an ETF to be licensed so that we don't see a million times more money in the derivative than the original instrument.

S1241 is unlikely to pass in its current form (we hope!) not least because it creates at least one "perverse incentive". For instance, it turns ordinary tax fraud that does NOT involve criminal proceeds, into "money laundering" - hitherto a much more serious offense. People who are vulnerable to the lesser charge may as well commit a more serious crime in an attempt to cover their tracks; the penalty won't be any worse. 
In principle, treating Bitcoin and Ether like ordinary money, or gold, is not necessarily a bad thing. But to conflate the holding of these assets with criminal activity, which some people do, is both stupid and dangerous (to many of us here). Even hodlers in Europe and other countries outside the US are at risk as there are specific provisions for accessing foreign bank statements. 
This is a Bill that needs to be watched closely.

If Armstrong is right, the network effects on the value of the leading coins will be enormous - far bigger than anything we've seen thus far. 
The most optimistic guesses suggest that there may be 30-50 million people in the world who own some crypto. A twenty-fold increase in these hodlers would almost certainly mean at least a fifty-fold increase in the amount of fiat entering the ecosystem (because once the numbers start to grow in earnest, the corporate money will enter too). That, if it happens, would push the price up a hundred times at least.
The old adage still holds: this asset will either go to zero or it will be huge. Hodlers be patient.

I have an uncomfortable feeling that by the end of *next* year his prediction may not be so far off the mark - at least on a log scale chart. 
If Libra actually gets off the ground, and Ethereum 2.0 launches without incident, and Baakt &amp; Fidelity are up and running, then the next BTC halving (next May) could well coincide with a crazy rally. If BTC hits $100,000 this time next year I will be very happy (obvs) but not entirely surprised.

If the node count goes up by 20x then the value should go up by some fraction of 400x (proportional to the *square* of the nodes).
In practice the exponent rolls off as the numbers get bigger - the equation morphs into something more like *n* log *n*
Moreover, a blockchain isn't exactly like a telecommunications network. Each node can be of very different value. 
If Metcalfe holds at all, I expect the graph would be sinusoidal (like a leaning over S)

Look around and make sure that your bank is OK with crypto - some are not. Make a small transfer every now and again from your bank to the exchange and vice versa (so long as this isn't too expensive - SEPA transfers are usually free). If the amounts are large - larger than you normally make with your bank - talk to them first.

In the first 2 years of BTC - 2009 &amp; 2010 - there were no markets and only a few miners. People famously tried (and failed) to sell thousands of BTC for $50!!!! Many people mined a bit, or traded a bit, and then gave up. The stories of hard drives being lost with BTC on them are legion. Some people die and passwords are lost. There are many reasons. Various studies have been done to estimate how many BTC are lost. The figure of 3 million is a fairly conservative estimate.
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:11:48
Exactly. Just a few are gathering on the quiet right now - maybe a couple of million BTC? When the next feeding frenzy happens, some of these buyers will cash out to bigger institutions, at higher prices. I'm curious to see when the first central bank buys some BTC. That will be a historic day, make no mistake. Once that happens, a major line will have been crossed.
@_date: 2018-08-13 08:24:41
Well said. The amount of debt a country carries can only really be judged by how big its economy is, how that economy is growing (or not), and how much of that debt is denominated in foreign currency. Even foreign holdings of debt don't matter too much so long as the debt is held in the country's currency. 
The analogy with an individual's debt is imperfect but on one measure it holds up: if I earn $100,000 a year then servicing a debt of $75,000 (75%) is manageable. But if I only earn $25,000 a year that same debt load is 300% of my income and may sink me. Now a *country*, unlike a person, can *choose* how much it earns, and how high interest rates will be. Countries also don't die, so government borrowing can, in theory, go on forever. Lastly, the US has the world's reserve currency, which means every other government and big business has to own some dollars. So US government debt, while big, is not only manageable in historic terms, but it is also in a special category when comparing it to other nations' debts - the T Bill is the debt of choice for institutional investors all over the world. 
Having said all that, even the mighty US dollar could tumble if enough people lose confidence in the government...

It looks as if about 3 million BTC are lost forever, so that headline should probably read *18 Million Bitcoin Club*.

A lot of people buy in during the big rallies, and then get frightened when the price falls. Selling at a loss out of fear that the price will go even lower is a common investing mistake. It is no surprise that so many fall for it when their first investment is in an asset that is so volatile. Even for those of us who have been through this kind of price cycle before it requires strong nerves.
I'm pretty sure that with the opening of block trading and OTC desks, some big players are quietly taking positions in BTC. Within a year or two I predict that 20 to 30 individuals/institutions/funds will control the majority of all circulating BTC. Given that around 3 million BTC are lost for ever, that would mean a maximum of 6 or 7 million BTC available for ordinary people (and other institutions) to buy. If just half the world's millionaires want in (that's about 15 million people), then the price could spike very high indeed around the time of the next halving.

Very good post. My view is that Bitcoin is now so much higher in the public consciousness than it was during the big 2014-2015 dip that the cycles will run a bit faster. Moreover, many people will have done what you did - roll alts into BTC - which will put a floor under the price somewhere around here.

Great comment. If the hard fork happens, I expect most of the subsequent trading volume will still be in BTC, not BTU, for the reasons you give. Besides, it is becoming ever clearer that the biggest beneficiaries of BTU are the miners, not ordinary users. And given that most mining is done in China, I can't help wondering if the Chinese government is making a (poorly thought out) play here.

The names on the bottom half of that list represent the faction of the Establishment that wants monetary policy to be 100% determined by government. They usually frame this as a given - like some fact of nature - and thus anything that undermines this view is either crazy or evil. 
The obvious rejoinder to this is that as things stand, just a few men (including some of those names) exert enormous influence on the money supply. The fact that this has been true for centuries does not make it either right or good. Far too often we've seen policy made that benefits the few (sometimes vanishingly few) at the expense of the many, or, even when the men concerned have been of good heart, they simply get it wrong. Most often, these decisions are made for the benefit of corporate interests when they coincide with geopolitical ones. 
Bitcoin is still no threat to the G7 governments or the big 4 monetary systems (US Dollar, Euro, Yen, and Swiss Franc), but another couple of years like the past decade and it will become one. Assuming governments don't criminalize crypto, at some point, one or two smaller countries, at least, will want to hold BTC as part of their reserves. Many commercial institutions would follow suit. At that threshold the IMF would include BTC in the SDR calculations. And if one or more of the major economies decided to get ahead of the game...well, then all bets really would be off. 
The thing is, economics is not like physics. It's not even like the weather. What people *think*, and *feel*, affects the data (many are beginning to say that what people think and feel *are* the data). In other words, economics is a highly reflexive system (in the Soros/Popper sense), and an asset like BTC that has such an abstract link to the physical world is especially so. 
I would say that there is a threshold of participation that, once passed, ensures a minimum role for BTC in the global economic system. Have we passed this threshold yet? I don't know, but if we haven't, we can't be far away.

You're quite right - that has been the pattern in the past. From the Tolpuddle Martyrs to the computer, the worry has always been about putting people out of jobs, but it has turned out differently (even if the transition was painful for many). 
AI is a different kind of technology though. It isn't just about labour/energy saving. As Martin Ford puts it: technology up til now has been a *tool*. Now it is becoming a *worker*. The capacity to *learn* makes a big difference. No technology has ever had that before. Moreover, we're still in the early stages of AI and even though the performance domains are narrow and brittle it is outperforming humans in ever more tasks. Once AI modules start to overlap - what Steve Mithen calls "Cognitive Fluidity" - we could well see performance leaps of orders of magnitude. 
It may be that some tasks will remain human-bound for a long time. Very probably in fact. But the human-only domain is going to shrink rapidly. We haven't had the conversations we need to prepare for this.
As for UBI, this has nothing to do with "communist" ideology. In fact some of the most ardent supporters of UBI are found on the right. It is simply a possible solution to a problem that is approaching. Don't allow your hatred of one ideology to drive you into the arms of another...

What happens when a mountain of debt collapses?
Suddenly a great many people cannot make their payments; and financial institutions have to write off a lot of debt as the value of collateral and repossessed assets shrinks. A lot of money is effectively burnt.
Unemployment rises. Consumption declines. Inflation is either low (or negative) as money dries up; or else inflation is sky high as the money supply is boosted in an effort to shore up the collapsing mountain. 
In the major worldwide recession that would accompany a debt collapse, capital would seek the safest havens: gold, the Swiss Franc, and US Treasury bills. The US dollar enjoys a privileged role in the world economy, and is thus spared some of the problems almost all other currencies must face. As so many banks and national reserves hold dollars - a lot of dollars - the rest of the world effectively subsidizes American domestic borrowing (by buying more and more dollars). 
Will Bitcoin be included in this cohort of safe assets when the next recession hits (whether or not we *also* get a debt collapse)? In other words, will the next recession bring a lift in the BTC price? This does seem likely.

Welcome to the *Well-Under-One-Million* club. Millions of BTC are held by a handful of wallets. Millions of BTC are lost. Almost by definition, even if BTC becomes a major currency, very few people will ever own a whole Bitcoin. Even today, only 729,000 wallets hold more than a whole BTC [Ref]( Many people hold their BTC in several wallets, so at most I'd say 650,000 people own a single BTC.
That is a number I'd love to see grow.

OK. But the end of the bear (which I think you're right about) does not mean that the next bull will begin right away. Given the psychological impact of the last year, I'd say we're in for some months of sideways movement, a bit like 2015, with perhaps a gentle overall rise. 
The next rally, I think, will start this autumn - 6 months out from the next halving - and really pick up steam this time next year.

The RSK system that will launch on the BTC blockchain later this year effectively means that I can exchange value with someone on the Ethereum blockchain almost as easily as I can with someone on the BTC blockchain, even though some trusted agent or app is involved (akin to exchanging data and running apps between OSX and Windows). This would appear to create what we might call a meta-blockchain. If other blockchains can also run this, or similar code, then is it not the case that to ensure security and efficiency, all that matters is sufficient hashing power on any one blockchain? Or will the market pair down the jungle to two or three public blockchains?

We might see these crazy percentage gains (or losses) of these unknowns, but remember that in almost every case the liquidity is tiny - a few thousand dollars' worth of trades can halve or double the price in moments. As a rule, in any market raw price volatility declines as liquidity rises. This is why so many large BTC orders are traded OTC - so as not to swing the spot price so much.

You are right, but we've seen what happens when a central bank becomes too "independent" - the boss gets changed.  The people who run central banks are appointed by presidents or prime ministers, and their freedom to act is tightly circumscribed. If a tide of value flowed away from a G7 currency into BTC (enough to upset its exchange rate index), there would be a lot of buttock clenching going on within governments everywhere. 
If Brexit goes badly, for instance, watch out for a (further) sharp drop in the pound (and to a lesser extent the euro). Where will Brits put their spare cash? This is just the sort of moment where BTC could catch fire.

We can't be far away from the point where government rolls its sleeves up and starts to get very involved in crypto. I don't know what they'll do, or how they'll do it, but make no mistake, government will want to retain control of the money supply in the same way - more even - as it wants to retain control of its nuclear arms. Because to lose control of the money supply is to lose control of your country.

The point being that once the gold rush starts in earnest, half the world's millionaires, and quite a few investment funds, will say to their investment managers: "let's put one or two percent of the fund into BTC."  That will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars chasing available BTC, which will pump the price enormously. At that point, the other half of the world's millionaires and another tranche of investment funds will want in too, which will see another few hundred billion dollars come in. 
In other words, the regressive trend of the BTC price increase notwithstanding, the next spike, or perhaps the one after, could well be utterly, totally, crazy.

You make a very good point - sometime soon we are likely to see some powerful people turn on Bitcoin. They'll call it a threat to the dollar, to the US economy, perhaps even to "our way of life". You may think this is already happening, but make no mistake, we ain't seen nothin' yet. I predict there will be calls to make the trading of BTC illegal. (A ridiculous suggestion, as absurd as making the French language, or apostrophes, illegal, but silliness never stops politicians...)
Today Bitcoin (and the other major cryptos) do not amount to much in the grand scheme of things, but at this rate of growth BTC, and ETH (among others) will soon become much more attractive to many people, for various uses, and thus there will be a reaction against blockchain currencies.  
Now, some economists will see another story: as people around the world adopt BTC (and dollars) in preference to their national currencies, the value of BTC (and the dollar) will rise. The government never wants to see the dollar become too valuable. Siphoning some value away from the $ into BTC might be extremely convenient for the USG. In any case, some thinking and research into some concrete ways BTC will be good for the Treasury, and the public finances generally, is a matter of urgency.

Actually a fractional derivative system of BTC could work very well...provided it was backed automatically and as decentralized as BTC. Having a central authority would be the equivalent of a central bank - the lender of last resort, which would have to be a government to have any credibility. This would obviously negate the whole point of BTC in the first place. 
What may well happen is that we'll see a kind of govt-sanctioned system - perhaps Mastercard's - as a way to try and get control of this kind of money. It won't work, obviously. You either have sound money or you don't. You either have a decentralized, permissionless system or you don't.

A lot of professional money will enter BTC as rich people shift their holdings out of stocks and real estate and commodities.

This is how the authorities will try to close down Bitcoin - by shutting the on-off ramps. And make no mistake, some governments are going to make an effort here.
By making it very hard to buy or sell BTC, governments would severely restrict the market and the price would undoubtedly suffer, with knock-on consequences for hash rate and security.

But we don't all want to control our own money. In fact very few want that. Most people are simply not willing, or able, to take responsibility for the security of their money. Even many of those who are on top of the tech would rather give up a bit of autonomy in return for convenience and some deposit insurance. The idea that we're all going to be independent, libertarian, autarkists is for the birds. Sooner or later we'll *all* get taken, or make a mistake, or something, and most of us will want a customer service number to call.

Government will always be able to take wealth or income, if they so choose. It makes no difference in how we measure the size of the economy. Even if BTC becomes the single world store of value, governments will find a way to tax it here and there. But it is true that in this case no government could depreciate this value through inflation. 
The larger point is that no major government is going to relinquish control of its money supply. Never. No way. Some might go to war over this. Others might co-opt any new system that threatened the local supply. Others might peg a local fiat to the new gold. Whatever the case, don't expect some autarchic nirvana where governments lose the power to seize assets.

While the Metcalfe "law" says that the value of a network rises in proportion to the squares of the number of nodes, that does not necessarily mean a linear relationship.

Quite what the exponent is, and what the Bitcoin equation is, is not yet known.

Switzerland or Japan are the prime candidates. In both countries the central banks hold vast amount of commercial equity - usually considered a no-no for central bank reserves - so much in fact that they really cannot buy any more. If they need further assets perhaps BTC will be their choice. Needless to say, if either of these CBs is discovered to hold BTC, the price would immediately go through the roof.

We do need more owners of BTC. There are only 7,875,811 addresses that hold more than $100 USD. Some people own multiple addresses. Some of those addresses are orphaned. I'd be amazed if there are 7 million people in the whole world that own more than $100 USD of Bitcoin. Fewer than 3 million addresses hold at least $1000 (one thousand USD) worth of Bitcoin. 
These low figures makes it much easier for governments to come down hard on BTC if they so choose - and some are bound to. 
The best way to increase resilience is for more people to own Bitcoin. That requires better UX and easier on ramps.

To be sure, in normal discourse - about equities for example - we talk of a controlling stake being 51% of total stock. But BTC isn't like that. 
If you wanted to be able to be the dominant market maker, you'd need to be able to buy or sell enough BTC to keep the price at a certain level. That would not require owning 51%. A much smaller percentage would suffice. You *would* need to be the largest holder, by some way, but that is well below 51%. In fact, if you could move the market sufficiently, it would be a trivial exercise to gradually accumulate more and more BTC for a net cost of zero. In other words, if a big government (or more likely, a group of central banks) chose to add BTC to the SDR and hold it as a reserve component, the IMF would be a kind of Bitcoin Central Bank. Within a short time, holding 20% of the supply would be utterly dominant.

See also today the IMF and Bitcoin -  
For BTC to become a reserve currency, central banks will have to be holders. That looks more likely by the day, but is still a way off.
Also, the major players - US and EU - will have to swear off taxing BTC transactions. A reserve currency cannot function efficiently while every transaction is taxed.

I think so many people are now expecting a rally to coincide with the next halving (a year and a bit away), that there could well be a lift in the price later this year as people try to accumulate before the market gets hot again. 
Also, each time there has been a rally in the past the price has gone up much further than anyone forecast. I think this will be true of the next rally too, even though many people got burned this last year.

To a point. Government sets the rules for borrowing. The banks lend aggressively according to those rules. Government also uses the easy borrowing environment to cut back its own spending. Millions of people now pay for goods and services on credit rather than with cash as they would have 50 years ago, and worse, many formerly free or low cost public services (in many countries) now require part or full payment from users. Requiring people to carry a debt load has become normalized. It is in effect public policy. It's a disgrace.

BTC outputs, addresses and transactions are at last pointing the right way. Lining up for a good ride next year.
The danger now is not from hackers or bad actors but governments fearful of losing monetary sovereignty. 
It would not be a total surprise if we wake up one day soon to find that the IMF, Fed, ECB, BoE, and a few others have announced that they are going to take a controlling stake in BTC (which would only need to be 10%-20% of the total - a trivial cost for a group of sovereigns!).

Good post. Also, debt only becomes a problem once repaying it consumes more than a certain portion of income. Moreover, when a national debt is denominated in local fiat, a government can devalue that borrowing by printing money and increasing inflation. This obviously leads to other problems, but in the long run (and governments do think in the long run when it comes to borrowing) government debt is much less of a burden than private debt. 
Right now the problem is private debt - our mortgages, car loans, school loans etc. There is no inflating our way out of this. If a crisis comes, a lot of debt will have to be written off. The taxpayer cannot ride to the rescue to the extent it did in 2008. The banks will again be in trouble. This time some will go bust. A lot of money will vanish from the economy. Ironically, some currencies (esp the dollar) might well become more valuable...
@_date: 2019-04-22 18:39:38
Taxing transactions makes it hopeless as a means of exchange. Unless governments accept BTC as a freely spendable currency, the best we can hope for is BTC as a savings vehicle (still a very attractive proposition).

CL's problem is that anyone buying BTC is choosing a monetary policy that is markedly different to the euro or dollar, which are designed to lose value by about 2% a year. If the ECB (or BIS, or CBCH) sets up its own digital currency, this will simply make it easier for people to swap their fiat for BTC (or other crypto) - especially as automatic, decentralized exchanges become more commonplace and reliable. Either the ECB integrates BTC into the financial system (as a commodity or a currency instrument), or else it will have to respond ad hoc to capital flows. In either case BTC acts as a savings soak, and thus as a new policy constraint - especially as German citizens will soon be controlling their BTC through their banks in the same way as they control their fiat. 
BTC is like a magic potion that's got into the water supply. It's already far too late to quarantine it or ban it or anything like that. The wider system is well and truly under its spell, and the way forward for the central banks is to get ahead of the curve - adopt, regulate, and control. I think the IMF will come under increasing pressure to include BTC in the Special Drawing Right calculations. Once that happens, hang on to your hat!
@_date: 2019-04-27 20:39:10
TL;DR: About 3 million BTC are almost certainly lost forever. More BTC get lost every day as people die without making provision for bequeathing their coins, and others lose their keys.

Trying to get a number on how many *people* own some BTC would be useful, but is also difficult. Counting wallets, like this, is a poor proxy that requires assumptions. I'd say *at most* there are a million people behind those $1k-plus wallets. 
In other words, we are still at a very early stage in this new monetary experiment. Once we get to 100 million people with at least $1k in BTC, *then* we'll be getting somewhere.

My projection suggests $10,000 by summer 2019 (249 day doubling time). But I fear that unless the scaling and political issues can be fixed, soon, as well as the terrible cognitive ergonomics (shared by most coins), another coin will have displaced BTC long before then.

This isn't just FOMO. There is standard psychology behind this - something that is super-valuable is more desired than something that is so-so-valuable.

It becomes less "weird". Trust increases. Institutions get in. It acquires the necessary imprimatur.

Well said. If anyone thinks governments are just going to sit back and watch their power to control the money supply ebb away, I have a flying porker to sell you. Now, some governments will try and ban Bitcoin and crypto. That obviously won't work (c.f. China). Next, they'll try and tax it to death (c.f. USA). There will be numerous workarounds for that too. Then they'll start their own cryptos, which is what we're starting to see now, and this is going to give credibility to the whole sector. But of course, there will still be currency depreciation, so for savers BTC will still be favourite. Inevitably, central banks will have to buy most of the available BTC and it will become part of the SDRs and national reserves. At that point, one BTC will be worth a LOT...

Here's my conspiracy theory of the day: A handful of rich people decide to corner the market in BTC. They quietly put funds on all the big exchanges and warm up all the OTC brokers. Next, they pump prime as much FUD as they can - by arranging for negative voices to be interviewed in the press, and hiring some forum posters. Then, they wait for something that they cannot directly control but which will catalyze their preparation. Something like Roubini's piece the other day, or suchlike. Finally, they start selling some previously accumulated coins, which leads to a price fall...

Seignorage vs new money is only an inflationary problem when too many people are heading for the exits, like we have now. So long as there are enough new wallets every day, and enough of them are new people, the problem is trivial. On this score, the picture doesn't look too bad at all -

As soon as any central bank buys some bitcoin, others will follow suit. Once that happens, even if it's just a few small countries' central banks, commercial banks and other institutions around the world would (will) pile in. The price would go mental.
As the OP suggests, Switzerland could be in the vanguard here. And being a leading banking nation, I would expect dozens of CBs to follow suit. I would be very interested to know if anyone has done any modelling of this kind of scenario. I expect the gold rush in almost any scenario led by one or more central banks acting publicly would be off the charts, so perhaps a slow and anonymous purchase strategy is more likely. We'll see.

Lovely post. One thing we have to factor in when making these calculations is the loss of the asset. Quite a bit of gold has been lost over the years (some gets recovered). Bitcoin too - estimates suggest that as many as 3 million BTC are lost forever. Cash is a bit different, because apart from losing or destroying paper notes, very little gets lost. Also, while a lot of new cash will definitely get created, it is possible that some new gold reserve is found that would depress the price quite a bit. But the seignorage of Bitcoin is fixed forever. In other words, the *net* inflation figures are even more favourable for BTC.

If anyone thinks for a moment that governments are going to abandon control of the money supply, then I've got a flying pig for sale. Governments would let go of their defence capability before letting go of the money supply. The only question with respect to crypto is *what* governments will do.
The OP is right. Banks perform a necessary function. I expect they'll step in and start offering custody of crypto alongside normal fiat accounts.
@_date: 2018-11-28 09:18:56
Quite right. We need a better index to rank coins, one that includes more metrics and gives a fairer and more realistic picture. The idea that two forks of Bitcoin are in the top 10 (given the difficulty of accessing and trading those coins) is absurd. The presence of likely scams in the top-ranked coins is also cause for concern. Coinmarketcap, in particular, may find that their lack of diligence in this matter will bite them in the butt one day. At the very least there should be a traffic light system whereby coins are rated for transparency. Brokers do this with stocks and bonds. Why not here too?
Edit - just seen this -  Let's hope it includes indexing sites too.

This is a really important study. If nothing else, it underlines the reflexive nature of indicators in this sector, and the importance of psychological market thresholds. 
If the suggestions play out as the authors predict, then the bottom of this cycle is here or hereabouts. The market will slowly increase this year, then start to pick up in Q4, and the next rally proper will be well under way by the time of the next halving (next summer).

If Putin wants to ditch the dollar, having the RCB buy Bitcoin would be one way to do it. Think of the consequences: many commercial banks and probably a few other central banks would follow suit. The price would rocket up. That would bring another wave of corporates and the public on board. We might be talking about $20-$30 billion into the market in a short time, almost certainly with more to follow. The US government would probably want to impose controls, but its leverage would be very limited given that so many Americans are exposed. It may even be that once one central bank starts buying BTC, the Fed would start buying too! 
This story might be fanciful, but the idea of a central bank buying BTC is not so far fetched.

Which assets represent what fractions of the world's wealth at any given time? The answer is difficult because the situation is constantly fluid. Not so long ago most human wealth was in land, then metals, then industry, then.... Now we have a complicated picture in which debt, equity, derivatives and other intangibles comprise by far the largest chunk of total wealth. It is by no means impossible that Bitcoin (and/or another system) could be a store of enormous wealth. It could even happen quickly. Imagine, for instance, a single central bank or government started buying Bitcoin. Others would be forced to follow and the wealth pie chart would very soon look quite different.

Price falls = people selling. Lower price -&gt; fear and worry. Fear and worry -&gt; more selling...
Worse, as the price falls, stop losses and margin calls are triggered, which pushes the price down further. Those who bought near the top feel the most pain and some of them sell out of fear that they'll never get their money back. 
It's a shake-out. As the investor Peter Lynch famously said, the organ you need to make money is not the brain, it's the stomach.

The thrust of this article - that central banks have been buying instruments that they have no business buying - could mean that another crisis is brewing (and thus gold is the safe haven), but it could also mean that central banks, some of them, will start to take positions in Bitcoin, given that every other asset class is maxed out. This is not so far fetched. Once Bitcoin's value trips over a certain threshold the IMF will want to include it as part of the SDRs, and central banks will start to buy. Even before then, as several commentators have been suggesting, some smaller countries' central banks may decide to get ahead of the game and step in.
A scenario even vaguely like this would have an enormous effect on the price, and catapult BTC, and perhaps one or two other coins, into the forefront of global finance.

There was a scaling wobble in March. It was nothing. There was a scaling wobble in July. It turned into a split and a rally.

That Franklin quote is all well and good, but what about real infants?  They cannot be expected to be responsible decision makers. A lot of parents make terrible choices for their kids. A lot of parents aren't there at all. So the state has to legislate for the care of children - product safety, nutritional standards, schooling, and all sorts of other things. The state also has to actually step in often and do the raising, or at least pay others to do it.  
And what about the elderly? Many of them can't make decisions either. And what of all those adults unable to make decisions because they are incapacitated, ill, brain damaged, or whatever? 
In other words, the state has to provide "security" in many forms, for a large part of the population. That sliver of the population that is over 18 and intelligent enough to look after itself - and which is happy to live off grid and forego the protections of the state - is mighty slim. They just have a lot of guns and make a lot of noise. 
And even the high priestess of libertarianism - Ayn Rand - had to rely on the state in her old age. To borrow a thought from Donne, no man is an island.

The OP makes a good point - more decentralization would be good. But in this scenario it would be obvious to all what was happening. A malefactor would have to do more than just get past the 51% line to make the fork stick. 
More problematic is what happens if, or when, the G20 central banks get together and decide to co-opt Bitcoin by buying a sufficient stake to control the network.  A holding of three million BTC should be enough. Five million BTC ample. Then there would be the matter of government-employed developers writing BTC code, central banks running mining farms...  Still, the price of BTC in such a scenario should soothe any concerns...
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:52:03
Whatever the actual number, it is tiny. The room for growth is enormous. If the number of people who own any BTC grows 10 times in the next 2 years, the value of BTC will grow by a factor of that - perhaps as much as 50 or 100 times. And if a *billion* people want to buy some BTC...

Bitcoin is NOT about making you rich!
OK. But it can help you avoid becoming poor. 
Be careful though - to buy Bitcoin is to choose a monetary policy. Once enough of us do this, the question of controlling the money supply of a country comes into play. No government is ever, *ever* going to relinquish control of its money supply. In other words, we should expect some attacks from state authorities. India looks aggressive already. Doubtless there will be others. Each new attack will learn from the failures of those that came before. In the long run this is clearly futile, but in the short term BTC might be weaponized as a political tool unless there are enough hodlers to make this kind of attack too expensive politically. Let's be cautious.
@_date: 2019-09-13 20:58:21

The world's central banks and treasuries may well launch an offensive against Bitcoin - probably by closing the exchanges - but this may have the perverse effect of making BTC more desirable, especially if recession hits and fiat currencies get into trouble with negative rates. 
The easier way for governments to deal with the BTC "threat" (which may well prove to be something of a saviour) is to buy a sufficient proportion of circulating BTC in order to control the market. For the G7 central banks this would amount to a relatively trivial purchase, and they would only need to hold a modest percentage of the total to control the market. I think this is a distinct possibility - *after* some governments go on the attack, and pay the price...

You may be right. I don't know. Some of the other objections raised here also have merit. My point is merely that governments are not going to allow untaxed transactions for long. They have the power to enforce at least some regulation, and they will exercise that power. Why try to resist that? And indeed, if we want to live in a civilized world, then taxes are price of admission. Just as the finance industry has been trying to resist crypto but is now beginning to realize that they need to stop boo-hooing and get ahead of the game, so should we spike the guns of government and start to put some proper investor protections in place, along with lines of accountability.

Don't sweat this. It is inevitable.
As Vinay Gupta has pointed out, government is not going to be excluded from crypto. On the contrary, they will demand their slice of the pie, and they are able to get it. There is no point in fighting this. If crypto is ever going to be mainstream, it WILL be just as transparent as existing banking, and for the same reasons. All sorts of firms will devise all sorts of ways to attach identity data to transactions - very possibly retrospectively.  
The big win here, it we can get mass adoption, is a monetary system that no government can abuse or interfere with. If Bitcoin, or Ether, or any other coin, becomes massive, at the very least it will force some big governments to be much more disciplined in their monetary and fiscal policy. I dare say some governments will abandon their fiats altogether in favour of crypto. (and once a central bank, somewhere, starts buying Bitcoin, the game will be forever changed - what a day that will be).

Unfortunately, India's government has a terrible reputation for heavy-handed regulation. Their recent attempts to ban cash caused chaos and resentment. It is no surprise that so few foreign firms do any business in India at all - the bureaucracy is Kafkaesque. Worse, the government has form when it comes to establishing rules that are straight out of Alice in Wonderland. Look at the Indian response to HIV and AIDS back in the 80s. Talk about facepalm. It seems little has changed.
But here we are. The government is presumably concerned about its hold on the money supply, and is trying to look after the local commercial banks. To do so it is attempting to ban crypto. It won't work, obviously. Indians are famously resourceful. I predict a thousand workarounds within days.

The Japanese state - through the Bank of Japan - have been  pouring money into the domestic ETF market for the last few years. Fully a third of the Japanese ETF market is owned by the Bank of Japan - an astonishing amount. There have also been massive bond purchases as part of their QE program. The Swiss central bank owns a lot of Microsoft and Apple (among others). It would be surprising to learn that the BOJ (or the Swiss central bank) is now buying this kind of asset - not only is it far too speculative for a central bank, but it is also non-domestic. It is one thing to prop up a local market. It is quite another to help overseas markets. But you never know...

A great many BTC are lost forever - people lost their paper wallets, or threw their old computer away when the price was $1.00 or whatever. I've read estimates that maybe a million BTC have been lost this way. In other words, if this is right, there are only really about 15 million BTC in circulation right now, with another million or so coming over the next few years. 
There are supposedly about 13 million dollar millionaires in the world (see -  This means that every millionaire *could* own a single BTC, if only all those people with *thousands* of BTC would sell theirs...

BTC is regarded by most governments as an asset, and not a proper currency. As such, any tax liability will probably only accrue when you sell the asset for local currency (dollars or euros or whatever). At that point you will have to declare the capital gain you have made and pay the appropriate tax. 
In other words, *where* you hold your BTC - paper wallet, hardware wallet, online wallet - is irrelevant. All that matters is that you declare the holding, if required, and pay any tax due when you liquidate the asset for national currency. 
You are right that there is no hiding from governments any more - the tax man will catch up with you sooner or later. If in any doubt, seek professional advice.

If there is a split, the value of chain A plus chain B will be much less than the current value of the single chain - even if the "Chinese" chain is popular in China (or elsewhere). The market will not like it. Just about everyone is better off if there is no split. 
In fact, if there is a fair chance of a split, I would expect a lot of selling before August 1, and zero trade volume for a few days afterwards while the dust settles. This would be the opportunity for someone, or some kind of consortium, to try and stage a coup of some sort, but I would be very doubtful of its success - the whole point of BTC is that nobody controls it or owns it. 
I predict a fairly pain-free transition and a big buy-in once the direction is clear.

Only 9 million addresses worth more than $100  --   
That means the number of *people* who own any BTC (more than $100 worth) is still very low; certainly under 10 million. This is probably dangerously low.

Crypto has none of this consumer protection. One mistake and you could lose the lot. This keeps millions and millions of people away. I'd gladly pay a small fee for the convenience and reassurance of this kind of protection, and I'm not alone in this.

Another 14 million are worth at least $1 but most of that is probably dust.

About half of all BTC in circulation is owned by roughly 1% of all hodlers, or maybe 100,000 people. Some of that includes the accounts of exchanges.

Make no mistake, if something like this happened - in any country - the government would jump in very quickly. No major government is going to surrender control of the money supply. Ever. They'll put troops on the streets first. 
I'm sure lots of clever people around the world have been thinking about how to deal with the Bitcoin "threat" if it comes to it. The answers doubtless range from the highly illiberal to the highly practical, but whether it's through co-option, taxation, or something more subtle, or brutal, governments *will* want to exercise control if they see BTC becoming a threat.

OP is quite right. Psychologists have known for a long time that humans are blighted by "loss aversion" - which means that we fear a loss more than we will risk for a similar gain. 
But we are also social creatures and follow the herd. In our case, once the BTC price is back in headline territory (somewhere between $10,000 and $20,000) there will be plenty of people who make the following (erroneous) reasoning: 










I thought that the BTC price would bounce along broadly sideways this year, maybe going up to 7k or 8k by Christmas, and a proper rally would begin shortly before the next halving in May 2020. Looks like I was too conservative. There is definitely heat in the market, and if the price goes up another 50% I suspect there will be a buying frenzy and an autumn spike.

Blimey. Even people on this sub, who know something about Bitcoin and crypto, are getting angry and fearful. 
If you're down 70%, 80%, even 90% on an investment, why bother selling unless you have to? The only other reason to sell is because you think it's going to zero - that the protocol is going to wither and die completely. Do you *really* think that is going to happen?
Buying or selling at a moment of high emotion is going to get you burned every time. In my old line of work there is a saying: when you feel bad you make bad decisions. Bad, in this context, means *fearful*.
There is a good chance that there will be another rally and a new ATH. It may take another year to get going. We may not be quite at the bottom yet. Experience is a brutal teacher.

Either incompetence or something fishy going on. In either case it is worrying. 
Bring on the DAO exchanges!

Lesson of this story - keep records and consult an accountant. How grim would it be to have the government knocking on your door in five or ten years' time accusing you of tax evasion or worse?

I think it's more like: "If we discover that you've walked on this path, we'll lock you up forever..."

You'll soon be able to wrap BTC and trade it on the Ethereum network. Using so-called smart contracts timelocking is easy -

The US government *could* shut down Bitcoin, functionally at least. It would be very expensive politically, but they certainly could do it. How? By passing a law making it illegal to exchange BTC for USD (or any fiat). This law would, in typical US fashion, extend to punishing foreign companies with a US presence that facilitated this trade overseas. At a stroke, all on and off ramps would be closed. The BTC price would collapse. And presumably this law would also cover Ethereum and the other cryptos. This would all but shut down the nascent blockchain industry - certainly public blockchains. 
The problem for the politicians like Mr Sherman is that millions of Americans are already invested in Bitcoin and other cryptos. Voters do not respond well when you destroy their wealth. Unless the law could be passed in a bipartisan way, the political cost would almost certainly be too high. Moreover, the millions of people in Europe and elsewhere who also own Bitcoin and other crypto would turn strongly anti-American with further political and economic cost. 
Far simpler for the US government to control this sector in another way: simply buy a sufficient percentage of circulating Bitcoin. The cost would be extremely modest - very possibly zero in the long term. The government could then relax about the supposed anarchic consequences (a trivial threat IMHO) of BTC. 
How many BTC would the Treasury need to acquire? Not even close to a majority of available BTC. Simply being the largest holder would offer effective price control. Two or three million BTC would easily cover it. This would not be a sunk cost, remember. This would be like the government's holding of gold or SDRs - an asset that can (and would be) constantly traded to help stabilize the dollar and wider economy. Quite a bolster to the US's balance sheet I would have thought - especially as every other country and commercial bank would immediately follow suit. Far from relinquishing control and risking foreign dominance (or anarchy), the US could easily cement its position as the world's principal economic power. The danger, in fact, would be that people would come to see BTC as an American artefact, controlled by a government - the very thing some hodlers are keen to avoid. In practice, of course, most people have no interest in notions of sovereign economics or even sound money. They just want to benefit from new technology and hopefully make a bit of profit. 
In any case, if we want to stop the US (or any other government) passing anti-BTC laws, then the answer is to onboard as many new people as possible, and to do it quickly. Another 100 million worldwide and no government could do more than huff and puff.

The idea that governments can't do anything about Bitcoin is absurd. If just one major government outlawed BTC in some fashion the price would collapse. True, the authorities in that country might not be able to seize your coins, but they could make them worth less. At the very least you'd have to go abroad to spend them.
Luckily, we are already past the point of no return on the political side - so many people now own some Bitcoin that the political cost of trying to close it down would be prohibitive in many jurisdictions.
Even so, no government is going to allow anyone or anything to threaten its control of the money supply. If and when BTC or crypto generally grows beyond a certain point, governments will start to flex their regulatory muscles, probably in concert with each other.

BTC and ETH are markets vulnerable to manipulation. Just today an academic report has been published which strongly suggests that the 2013 BTC spike was contrived. Until the market is much bigger, or properly regulated, this will be a problem.

Governments that place too onerous taxing conditions on an asset are shooting themselves in the foot. Most people don't mind paying some tax on a gain. But if a country's tax authority demands most of the gain on one kind of asset (but less on others), then people will take steps to avoid paying at all and the government will lose more revenue than the original tax would have raised. In Europe it is pretty easy to avoid punitive taxes like this as there are plenty of jurisdictions in which you pay little or no tax on crypto gains, and people are free to move.

In a few days' time we'll be saying the next halving comes up "next year". 
The pressure for a Bitcoin ETF is growing. The SEC might well conclude that it is better to jump than be pushed, or to put it diplomatically, they'll want to get ahead of the curve, and give the green light *before* the next wild rally. Of course, their approval would almost certainly spark a rally all by itself, so maybe they'll wait...

Yes indeed. Here -

This is a really good point that often goes under-appreciated. The liquidity of this sector is still very low by "normal" monetary standards. A relatively small increase in demand can push the price up significantly. 
One day we're going to wake up and find that the big investment banks, and perhaps even some central banks, have started acquiring BTC. The price will multiply on the day.
