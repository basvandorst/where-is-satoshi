guys, please don't be funny about this. this is serious. There is no way that my account could have been accessed on my part unless they had a backup phrase which is impossible. I need to contact blockchain support.

I don't know much about taxes. Can someone point me in the right direction? It was a substantial loss.

That's the email I got from Amazon. Please keep this here for posterity so it can be used as a signature if this person is caught.

I have a police report, FTC report for stolen identity, and a report to the FBI.
@_date: 2019-04-26 11:53:49
It happened after I swapped stellar for bitcoin though. I received no authentication, verification, or email. Can someone please help me?
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:19:39


Okay, so maybe that isn't the answer. Is there any other way that I can claim the loss?

I'm not giving up on this. Is there anyone that is skilled in "cryptotax" that can assist?

I submitted a support ticket. My support ticket ID number is 960191. Can you please respond?

It was bad. I'm getting spam emails with my wallet key listed as my name just to taunt me. I've contact the police, FBI, and the FTC. I don't expect anything back. I had to get a new bank account because my Amazon account was being used to buy gift cards.

I'm very sorry to hear about this. You may have some type of malware on your computer that resulted in your funds being stolen because your private information was somehow obtained. One of the most common types of these are browser extensions posing as bitcoin price tickers that are actually stealing your account information. There's also the possibility that you visited a phishing site posing as Blockchain. We've also heard of computer viruses that detect when an address is in your clipboard, and replace the one you wanted to use with an address controlled by this malicious party.
By design, Blockchain never has access to users' accounts or funds. If you keep your password and private key backups secure, then your funds are always safe with us. Since this information has been compromised, be sure to never use this wallet or any addresses contained within it. I'd also highly advise against using the same password again. I'm truly sorry that you had funds stolen from you. That certainly is an extremely frustrating experience.
