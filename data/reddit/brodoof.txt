Maybe, I'll punch the numbers in and calculate my profit.
But one more thing, do you know where bitcoin is stored? Is my wallet online?
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:27:03
Slow internet for a low score?!?
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:00:16
Oh fuck. A few cents a year?!?
Ok, you have a point. One more thing though, is the wallet stored online or do I need to download software?
@_date: 2016-11-14 19:13:04
Oh. Thanks dude!

I was memeing his typo

Helped you take over $10k*
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:16:41
True. Maybe if I had more than 100 dollars in BTC, I'd go to a hardware wallet.

How do you loosen a coin? How can you loosen software?

How do you implement the code and what is the code, if I may ask? My post was removed because people assumed malice
@_date: 2017-09-18 01:03:50
The price it's being sold for, divided as the company pleases
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:43:11
I'm not triggered, I just find it odd that people can't admit that they aren't entitled to free stuff.
Downvoting my original comment just proves that you're triggered by anti-piracy

Great, what about everybody that isn't an artist?
People who help artists sell things or... I don't know... Anything besides music?

Give them the passcode ahead of time. They ARE family.
Just set it up to wait a day between transfers in case of a nasty divorce or something
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:19:43
Not nearly as much

Coinbase is just fine IMO, sure it has problems but it's convenient for newer users, easy interface and provides a lot of information.
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:54:53
Not really, I'm just looking for an actual argument for piracy that deems it not immoral
