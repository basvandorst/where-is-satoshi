I agree. The hassle just from banks when trying to access or store your own funds are ridiculous. Imagine the potential of a currency when no centralized bank is needed, user security is extremely high - I want to see the future of BTC when it comes to retina/fingerprint authentication as a means of digital security (ie, any payment over 0.05 BTC will require a retina, fingerprint or physical seed so no one can jack your unlocked device and quickly sneak away all your hard earned moneys).
Bitcoin and other cryptos still have a long way to go, but the potential is there. Adoption into the mainstream is what's needed. Multisig integration for online purchases to ensure customer safety (although I'm not sure of a workaround that wouldn't require an honest, objective third party in the case of disputes)I think is a big hurdle to tackle as the one thing thats nice about fiat digital purchases through PayPal or MasterCard is you have your card issuers safety for chargebacks and whatnot.
Thanks for your wicked an in depth reply! Stay in it friend :)

I want me a little house on a mountain by a river that has a water wheel to power 80 GTX 2070Ti's so I can get those sweet sweet mining gainz.

For real. I'd love to be paid with crypto, do my taxes with crypto and buy things with crypto. So much quicker and more efficient!

I wanted to bite and go at it roughly a year ago, when it was $8,00. Any idea what the difficulty back then was compared to now? Silly of me not to invest, but of course, hindsight is 20/20.
