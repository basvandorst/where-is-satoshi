Not at all, I just feel like there needs to be a company that can’t go bust, one that’s secure and prepared to put their reputation on the line. Coinbase are a start up, they make so many mistakes, I don’t trust them really. Microsoft could be a great company to fund a secure exchange, one where we don’t worry about our money going missing. The Crypto world needs a well run and trusted exchange, then the world will jump in.

You sold at $23, you wouldn’t have made it to $50 without selling. Just invest now, in 3 years you may have $730k.

Crash coming. Everyone wanting free coins is leaving the room. Trigger panic sellers. 2bn out of the market cap in an hour.

New account. Shouldn’t talk shit about redditors. Shame on you mate.

Really? Bitcoin is down 10%. Market cap is down $6bn. Think I was pretty accurate. I think you’re referring to yourself when you speak.

Roger, don’t call Bitcoin Bitcoin Core if you don’t like yours being called Bcash, you’re contradicting yourself. Stop tricking new people into Bcash on your website. Now people have realised you’re tricking them your trust is gone, you are coming across like a scam artist with a bad reputation. Now people know you’re tricking innocent new people it’s game over. Bcash is basically another altcoin scam, stolen name and stealing people’s money.﻿

It’s decentralised.
You own your wallet and only you have access to it.
Do your research, I’m already bored.

Gdax, YouTube videos are great at explaining no fees and limit orders, it’s really easy, don’t use coinbase. If you didn’t know coinbase and gdax are the same company.

Go and research what an ‘Exchange’ is, the clue is in the name.

Roger has all that money but chooses shitty cheap hotel to Skype from, he looks like a total untrustworthy twat. He’s the worst person on earth to promote anything, especially bcash.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:41:49
He never sold anything, he just doesn’t want to be robbed.

1 year from today. $60,000.

Both, if you had millions in bitcoin are you really going to tell people? No. The only logical reason to ‘publicly’ tell people is to look like you don’t have any, and the only reason you’ll do that is so nobody kidnaps your kids.
