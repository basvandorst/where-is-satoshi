You said all of your holdings were provable, now you are claiming they are not. Shocking based on your history. /s
Having 2,300 BTC is a low amount considering how long you have been in the community and how long your operation has been running. No one is doubting you personally have 2.3k BTC. People are doubting that you have any real users and any real volume. 
Some people suspect once you realize no one will buy out your company for the numbers you are demanding you will just run with the funds you were able to get from the few ignorant and trusting.
Best of luck but there is no reason any one should trust you with their money over LCB.

You are claiming to be able to prove you have around 2 Million in Fiat. Please do so....
Your amount of holdings of crypto is pretty small. I'm not doubting you have that much, I'm doubting that you have that many users crypto. We know your end game is to get bought out by someone larger but fake value and fake users is pretty weak.  Once caught at fraud you are going to need to prove your claims especially when you say you can prove them. You are not trusted in the community and are seen as a potential scam site. There is no way your volume would be higher than LBC unless you fake it. Using your company to hold and trade your own funds would be "fake" volume in my book. Wash trades are not counted in most places as real volume. 
TL;DR You can not be, and are not trusted.

Is English your first language? This might be the issues here. 
I never said your bitcoin was not provable, I'm not disputing you have access to Bitcoin. Most people who have been around as long as you should have a fair amount, significantly more even then you are claiming to have. The problem is what you can't prove is that you have trading volume or users. You also can not prove you have the fiat you claim to have. You said you could prove that, this might have been because of lack of English skills but you made a claim you can not back up. This is one of many. 
We know your goal is to sell your "company" to a larger operation or VC but you are dreaming on your valuation. I have no idea if you will ever scam anyone but there is no reason to trust you as you have been caught in the public before with fraud. Will you scam people if they give you a chance? Not sure, but I see no reason why people should find out. 
You as a person have been in the community a long time, as a bitcoin user. Your exchange has not amassed thousands of bitcoins, you have not been more successful than LBC. No one is going to buy your company, the users and volume are fake. 
Try reading what I have said again, there are no contradictions here. If you need help with any words let me know. I also did not edit my stuff so I might have made a typo or two. If you point it out I can edit my post or clarify. 
English is tricky, as someone who is trying to learn Thai I feel your pain.

Glad it was all in good fun:)

You should go ahead and do this. Claiming you can prove it with out doing so is a bit silly.

I would highly recommend staying away from this guys site. He is unregulated and was the guy who got the media to list Thailand being illegal in Thailand in the first place. Is he just incompetent or was his goal trying to keep others out of the market? 
He is not trusted in Thailand and his volume is highly suspect. Stay away!
Edit: [I did not even know about this scam!](
Edit2: [Here he defends if you can call it that](
