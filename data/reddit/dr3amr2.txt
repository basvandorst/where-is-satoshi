He would have never been able to turn 3 BTC to 200 if it wasn't for margins.  So no, he would not have been able to make 400 btc playing the dips.  Margin allows people to make money when the market is going up or down.   
He was dumb for playing his entire stack.  He got used to making big bets as his stack grew on the bull market.  He was chasing for that crazy high he got from winning in the beginning.  Easy money in, easy money out.  I'm sure he went on tilt after the first big hit and he tried to recover his stack.

Or just take a picture... But your method is better.  Carry on

So did you have 2FA enabled prior to this?

This is a made up story, correct? Where the author is envisioning how he would talk to the online gambling industry?

I tried to claim it on both the app and website, it doesn't go through right away.  Tried to claim it multiple times in the past few hours with no success.   Good to know that it's working fine for you though, since that could point to some issues specific to my account or something.   The rewards keeps bringing me back to eGifter too, but it's getting way too problematic.

No clue why the "Claim Card" is taking forever for me, but ever since they switched back and forth on the coinbase restriction was when I noticed that the final step takes forever.   It used to be instant.

Do you have the 2FA key stored somewhere on in your email?  A common mistake that I see a lot of people do, is sending themselves an email of the 2FA key.  So when their email gets hacked, it also gives the 2FA to their other accounts.

That's valid, time will tell.  When in doubt just hodl everything till the dust settles :)

* Do you have 2FA enabled on your gmail?
* Is your email password different from your bittrex password?

That's just the SegWit2x vote.  Yes, miners are flip flopping between supporting or not. 
Maybe I misunderstood what you meant when you said "quit" in your original post.  They might have pulled out on supporting the Segwit2X proposal, but it doesn't mean they "quit" bitcoin.  The Segwit2X is not the boss of miners. It's a proposed solution  to help with the scalability problem.  I'm just being nit picky with the way the title was worded since the analogy isn't correct.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:59:29
You mean users on one side of the camp.  SegWit2x doesn't represent all the users.  That's why there's this whole civil war within BTC.  Miners are also users too.  Every side has an opinion, but no one is quitting BTC.  They are not supporting the opposing sides solution.     
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:05:40
Agreed that the philosophical difference is pretty big between the two camps.  It's just wishful thinking that there could be a good middle ground somewhere.  Not impossible, just highly improbably at this rate.  
We can have each camp put out their best solution.  When there's so much at stake, it's always easier and safer to stick with the original chain and not the new forked one.  I don't even know how any new chain could ever be renamed to be the "Bitcoin" even if people do support it more down the road.   It has to be agreed upon before the fork, never after.
I totally agree on the investor part.  Just hold and wait out the storm, hopefully a clear winning shows up.  
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:15:01
So how does one determined which one is BTC? If the miners don't upgrade to SegWit2x, it means that they will still be running the original chain that BTC started on before this upcoming hard fork.
I don't care which chain wins, but I'm just pointing out that it's not as white/black as you hope here.  This is why companies like Coinbase are being cautious with keeping the original chain called BTC and the new one called B2X till there's a clear winner between the two.

They didn't get a 600% raise.  The price might have risen 600%, but the difficulty rate is always rising quickly, so they have been getting fewer coins for the same hash rate.  
They are threatening to "quit" (I don't see anyone said they were straight up quitting here, do you have any sources), because as "workers" you're allowed to have inputs on how the project is going.     
I'm not for/against for any team here.  Frankly I just think both sides are childish adults that's going through a nasty divorce.  They really need to work together to find a good solution, not start a smearing campaign against each other.

Don't forget that Winning Poker Network added Bitcoin to their deposit/withdraw system.

Are you booting up your computer with that old hard drive or are you accessing that hard drive as an extra drive space?
If it's the latter,  then the reason it's not showing up is because it's not looking at the directory that was stored in your old hard drive.  To make it work, you'll need to copy the wallet.dat from your old hard drive to the C: drive on your new PC. Navigate 
* &lt;Drive Letter Name of old hard drive&gt;:\Users\\&lt;Your User Name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\
    
    
Your wallet.dat that holds the bitcoins should be in there.  Just copy that and over to your local C: Drive location
* C:\Users\\&lt;Your User Name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\
 
The coins should should populate after restarting the bitcoin client.
PS - Always backup every wallet before you start copying and pasting around.  Don't wanna mix up the empty wallet with the one that has money in there.  You'll lose your coins for good if you do that.

Sweet that's awesome to hear!
The wallet.dat is what it sounds like, the wallet.  The private keys can be exported out from the wallet.dat if you want to store the coins offline.

That's not true, I'm still under this hold as we speak :(
@_date: 2013-06-07 17:39:50
Yup this is what i'm using too, it only cost 25 cents to transfer any amount if you are verified on both accounts.  
My only gripe i have with Dwolla-&gt;Campbx is that they have a 31 day hold where you can transfer your BTC to any other wallets.  Trying to buy some LTC at the moment, but I can't due to this limitation.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:03:00
I'm using Schwabs too, and I've been doing similar transactions as you without any complaints on there part.  :)
@_date: 2013-06-29 06:30:59
At this point mining with one 7970 wouldn't be worth it unless you're taking a gamble that the price of 1 btc will be worth a lot more than what it is right now.  I'm going to assume that you'll get 750 Mhash out of your card.  So according to this site you'll get 1 BTC in 52 days.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:01:16
Damn.... I wish i saw this post sooner, I would have taken this bet :)  Good luck
