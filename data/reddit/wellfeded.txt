I think BCH will rally in the short term if segwit 2x doesn't activate on BTC.
If coinbase makes it easy to dump BCH, that will almost definitely destroy it if it doesn't have a run like BTC is having now.

I believe this will come in a physical device that will enable simple payments and transactions between parties and protect private keys better than any phone or computer.
Think trezor with a qr scanner that’s much cheaper.

Exactly why you should get your coins out of coinbase!

I believe the miners are rewarded in Bitcoin via transaction fees.
This doesn’t harm bitcoin miners, as it allows them to mine both blocks at the same time.

Rootstock (rsk.co) is supposed to go live by the end of the year that’s a sidechain to BTC and it’s coins value will be pegged to BTC.

I've been getting marketing emails from him saying this for at least 2 months.

Check out the way rootstock is doing merged mining: 
It’s basically a way that bitcoin miners can mine the sidechain at the same time they are mining bitcoin.

Yea, the ICO is over now, but you basically need to be an accredited investor in the US (i.e. Rich)

This is marketing material to sell his subscription service, so the sensationalism is to sell his investing advice.
His analysis of amazons involvement in cryptocurrencies seems like it could hold some merit, and Altucher does have a pretty good track record.
He believes in bitcoin, but seems to think that the altcoins are the way to real gains, and promises that if you subscribe he'll tell you the alt coin that will make you rich.  I suspect that it's filecoin, since he was an early round investor.
