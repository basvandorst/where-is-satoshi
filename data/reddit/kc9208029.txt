It's great to see that you have even increased your support to SENS Research Foundation and the related Methuselah Foundation. Mr. Aubrey de Grey [almost bursts into tears here when talking about the recent cryptocurrency donations that SENS has received.]( Keep up the good work! Please consider donating even more to SENS / Methuselah as these donations hugely speed up the development towards a world where aging has been brought under medical control. And that increases the probability of all of us - yourself included - reaching the [Longevity Escape Velocity.](

Dear [u/PineappleFund]( I hope you have a little time to see a 5 minute youtube video called [Why Die?]( and a 7 minute video called [Why Age?]( and will be convinced, like I am, that aging really is the biggest problem in the world today. It causes far more suffering and death than any other cause, or even all other causes combined, both in developed and in developing countries. I see that you have already made a great donation to SENS Research Foundation, that supports the most effective way forward to bring aging under medical control - that is addressing directly the types of damage that cause aging. It is beautiful and visionary that you have already chosen to support the work of SENS. I wish you will consider allocating to SENS an even bigger part of your donations, taking into account that aging really is the world's biggest problem, causing 100.000 deaths every day, and constant pain, suffering and indignity to millions more.
I created a Reddit account just to post this suggestion. I'm a guy from Northern Europe and am not affiliated with SENS, except that I of course support their research.

That's great to hear! I recommend looking into cryonics as well - a plan B in case we don't make it to the LEV. For example, [Alcor accepts crypto donations.]( Be sure to sign up yourself too! We'll need people like you in the future :)
