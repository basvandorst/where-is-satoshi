Can somebody explain to me how this will change things on a day-to-day basis?
@_date: 2015-04-21 22:29:40
The NSA monitors pretty much everything.

100 bits

Thanks to all the tippers out there! One of the best ways to spread the word about Bitcoin and do some good at the same time.

Ugh, terrible news.  Consensual non-violent activities like gambling should be legalized so this kind of thing stops happening.

True, but I don't believe she would take a currency like Bitcoin that has the potential to take away so much power from the government.  She would not want to show any tacit support for it.

2 things I love, Bitcoin and beef jerky!
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:43:21
This whole BitLicense thing is such a joke. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:56:05
Hopefully they will set a great example for the rest of the world on how Bitcoin can spur innovation and economic activity if the government doesn't crack down.
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:32:39
Good luck with that!

I've spent some time in Argentina and Bitcoin is desperately needed in their economy. 
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:07:18
Demand being higher than supply.

This is huge...
"Goldman Sachs is becoming the first major bank to make a significant investment in a Bitcoin-focused company, giving a vote of confidence to the embattled virtual currency.
The Wall Street bank announced late Wednesday that it had struck a partnership with a major Chinese investment firm, IDG Capital Partners, to lead a $50 million investment into Circle Internet Financial, a start-up that aims to use the technology underlying Bitcoin to improve consumer payments."

It will only be a fad if the desire to have complete control over your own money is a fad.

I really think one of the reasons Bitcoin has been such a success is the manner in which Satoshi handled himself and released it to the world.
@_date: 2015-04-24 19:13:43
Good, hopefully they just dissolve and go away.  We can fund the core development in another manner.

He won't be getting my vote because he isn't libertarian enough, but he is definitely the best candidate in the field and I'm glad he is pro cryptocurrency.

Excellent video!  I love bitbutter's videos.
@_date: 2015-04-24 18:36:50
Great to see two-way machines hitting the market!
@_date: 2015-04-22 20:18:12
Nice to see Investopedia posting a number of articles on Bitcoin recently.
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:08:58
Wow, pretty huge for the government to be funding a Bitcoin related project!
@_date: 2015-04-24 20:20:22
Haha, yeah wow.

Just goes to show how excessive regulation stifles innovation. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:45:13
This is HUGE...
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:28:37
Combining old and new technology...I like it. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:09:30
Excellent!  Hopefully this will serve as a good proof-of-concept for other social networks.
@_date: 2015-04-13 01:43:23
Hillary is by far the most pro-establishment candidate.  No way she would accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:08:21
So excited for this project.
@_date: 2015-04-21 22:27:33
Decentralize everything!
