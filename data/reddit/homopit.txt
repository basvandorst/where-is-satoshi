Download is not the problem, but as you found out, it's indexing and verification. Building an actual database on the disk. It helps if you have a SSD to put the database in, and to increase the RAM cache used for accessing that database. Default cache is 300MB, recommended is as high as you can set it depending on your RAM. (look for 'dbcache' option in the node client). 
With a decent dbcache (4-8GB) and a moderate fast CPU, verification should be done in about 6 hours.
If your PC is restarts in this process, you might have bad RAM or HDD.

Right now, mining is so concentrated in pools, that few of them can collude together, to create &gt;51% hashrate, and impose any change they want on the network. If that change is a soft-fork change, no other nodes, nor miners, can do any thing to prevent that.

Miners are incentivized to create valid block, and broadcast it to other miners. If other miners find that block is invalid, they will not mine on top of it, and the miner that produced such block will lose reward. Miners are incentivized to be honest. 
Non-mining, relay-only nodes are NOT incentivized to be honest, and we do not know what their agenda is.
Also, Miners use special networks for block propagation, FIBRE network, or FALCON.

No, they are not taking bitcoin and they are not converting it. It is a little more complicated.
They partnered with ICE, a company that is developing a BAKKT crypto exchange and payment provider service. 
Users will use BAKKT as a bank - by opening an account, and depositing BTC there. Accounts at BAKKT are custodial, that means that BAKKT owns the BTC deposited there. They call this 'warehouse'. All transactions among accounts in the 'warehouse' are not bitcoin transactions at all, but just entries into internal database at BAKKT. Bakkt is also doing the exchange form BTC to $, since Starbucks account will be keeping $. 
Users will not be able to pay with BTC wallets, but will have to use BAKKT issued wallet app, or card, for making payments.

Full blocks will lead to an unreliable system. Suppose you paid a fee to include your tx in first block, in the meantime there is a burst of new transactions, all paying to be included in first block. Your tx got pushed back, and all wallets are dynamically increasing the fees for new transactions.

It depends on how big your transaction is in bytes, not btc amount.
For a standard transaction of 250 bytes you put a fee rate of 200 satoshis/byte. It will then confirm in the first next block. (minimum fee rate for first block is around 50 satoshis/byte right now,

On your hardware it can not take more than 5 hours.

    Internet connection:
       25 Mbyte/sec
    Sync time:

Set the -dbcache option high, on 16GB system give it 8000MB!
It's not the download that takes time on your fast connection, but the block validation. It takes lot of disk operations, and with dbcache option you can set the database cache higher from default 100MB, so disk is not needed for lookups that much.

When synchronizing, Bitcoin Core uses a lot of disk I/O operations to lookup data in its database. There is an option to set a database cache in memory, and with 16GB of RAM, you can set it to 8000MB. You can find the option in the GUI, or start the wallet with command line option -dbcache=8000. Synchronization then takes around 4-5 hours on your hardware (and decent Internet connection).

It's a very large transaction, you know? In bytes: 22131. Your fee rate is 25 satoshis/byte. It's around average, but there is a backlog forming right now, so other wallets with dynamic fees will outbid your transaction. You will have to wait a few blocks.

You need to understand the process. Please study  transactions more.
In each transaction, they are consolidating 70 inputs, to one output. They have millions of inputs, and this process is repeated many times.
That is exactly what your example address is showing many transactions of 70 inputs, to this one same output address. 
You can also see the effect on UTXO set - it is shrinking, means less memory used on nodes.

This is Xapo wallet, consolidating their coins. They have several millions addresses, with small amounts in, and they are now consolidating it into fewer addresses. This is good, because it reduces UTXO set requirements (unspent transaction outputs).

With LN, you will actually need to spend first. Or put up some or your money to that hub, so they will open a channel towards you with your money in it, or loan some money from them to do that, and pay interests to them. This is how a new business model is build ;)

Thank you for this analysis. I just looked over in a hurry, but will come back to read it more.
I noticed that you used the default setting for database cache (dbcache) option of 100MB, that's why your disk usage was so high. If you have time to do it again, to compare with some setting more optimal for a 4GB sistem, like 2500MB for dbcache? I'm sure it can shorten the time required, and would be nice to know how much.

That address sent you the coins, but they are still unconfirmed. You then used these unconfirmed coins in your transaction. Now your transaction must wait for that first transaction to confirm.

This is false. We know that for this implementation of AsicBoost transactions must be shuffled in the block. There are no transactions in empty blocks. AntPool mines empty blocks for different reasons. Most likely bad connection, or bad mining software.

Almost empty blocks, then. You have to be careful with terms. Yes, I found some strange 20 tx blocks from Antpool, that I want to know more about, but nobody is answering me on that. Comment is on the other, will paste it here, too:

You need to let it synchronize, at least up to the block with your transaction. If you have 4 or more GB of RAM in your system, you can speed the synchronization process significantly by setting the 'dbcache' option to a value higher than 100MB (default). On 4GB system I set it to 2000MB, if you have more RAM, set it even higher. Then restart Core wallet.

They know of on-chain transactions, but not LN transactions. To know the state of LN network, each node, after each channel update, broadcast the new state to all other nodes on the LN network. Surely you can see that this is not scalable any better than on-chain is. Even Russel, the lead LN developer in Blockstream admits, that somewhere above 10,000 channels, the LN network will become painful to use. He also said, that for new LN wallets coming online, it will start to suck even sooner, because that new node has to learn the state of the whole network.

Yes, but the network will clear this up, by confirming transactions if the mining luck changes, or by purging transactions out of the mempool after three days. Funny way to deal with money.
@_date: 2017-05-10 11:53:27
The transaction you are trying to create is a double spend of some other transaction that is already in the node's mempool. Nodes do not accept a double spend, unless the original transaction is tagged 'RBF'. Without an address or txid, I can't help you forward.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:20:15
Yes, segwit first, when it activates, then HF locks in. HF does not happen if segwit is not active.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:03:44
That's the trick. There are no confirmations. Listen to the video. Guys are joking.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:44:27
It's not that simple. If UASF splits with 30% of miners, that chain will have only 2 blocks per hour, huge backlogs will create, people won't be able to move the coins. The other chain will be finding 4 blocks per hour, but they can also raise the block limit, and with bigger blocks clear the backlog, allowing people to transact easily.
Then, all exchanges (or at least major ones) must run UASF nodes, or they won't reject non-segwit blocks, and will stay on the other chain with more hashpower.
Without hashpower, and without exchanges support, I don't see how UASF can survive. Individual nodes users are running are completely irrelevant.

If you do not wait for confirmations, all transactions are INSTANT! Segwit or no segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:53:16
~~This is beyond stupid. If you do not wait for confirmations, all transactions are INSTANT! Segwit or no segwit.~~ ;)

See this? Not all nodes are equal. Are you using your node as a wallet for your payments? If not, then your node is not relevant at all.
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:12:45
What a year delay? it's basically a segwit version as in core 0.14. 80% of the hashrate, and most of the businesses agreed to deploy it.  Segwit2MB lives again ;)
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:02:13
We know nothing on future profits in Bitcoin. With the current price rally, asicboost is even more irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:56:33
Look at the video again, and read the comments here again. 
This is an unconfirmed transaction. Works on bitcoin, now. If you do not wait for confirmations, all transactions are INSTANT
@_date: 2015-11-06 14:47:25
That transaction is using one unconfirmed input. Actually, it's a CHAIN of unconfirmed inputs. 
Here is the start of that chain: 
You can follow the coins down to your transaction from here. But this transaction has 0 fee, and it will take some time to confirm. Next time, do not accept payments that have unconfirmed inputs
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:34:56


read the linked original Segwit2Mb proposal, also.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:32:55
That video doesn't demostrate LN. Just plain unconfirmed transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:20:45
...and once we have LN.
BTW, LN is being built without any proof that it can even work on big scale, and they talk on global word usage.
If LN proponents want me to believe that LN can support millions of users, better they produce some proof. Some numbers. A simulation so we all can see how it can cope in real world. No need to run in on real network, not litecoin, not bitcoin, not testnet. A software simulation, with million nodes, so we can see what are the requirements, bandwith, storage, time for routing, channel funding and duration. 
You know of any?

If bitcoin fails, its blockchain will fail, too. But there can be other blockchain(s).

Old story. It was here on r/bitcoin about a year ago. A joke from r/butts
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:59:12
When you stopped mining, and decided to become a 'regular' user, your only power now is in your wallet - all you can do is support services that you like, and boycott the ones you don't.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:32:42
Read again. HF can only happen if segwit is already active.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:25:52
Users can not make these decisions. Users can only tell the companies they use what they want. Or stop doing business with them. Stop pretending that users have any more power than this.
@_date: 2017-05-10 17:54:46
If you do not wait for confirmations, all transactions are INSTANT! Segwit or no segwit.
Seems like some people think that segwit transactions are instant transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:00:16
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:06:34
What it does, then? Also honest question, because I don't understand what you think it does for you?
On Aug 1st, it will start rejecting blocks that do not signal segwit, and you get forked of the chain. You think miners are afraid of your node rejecting their blocks?
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:31:14
@_date: 2017-05-10 18:17:44


Isn't it? Really dumb. I looked the video twice to see what are they doing, couldn't believe it's so dumb.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:37:35
Yeah, the wording is bad. It is in the linked original Segwit2Mb proposal. This proposal is based on it, but the threshold is lowered to 80%.

Incredible is only the stupidity of those on the video.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:31:24
What? It says that HF happens only if segwit is already active.
@_date: 2016-05-20 00:26:30
First wait for Core v0.12.2 release with SegWit code. Then wait again for a v0.12.3 release with the HF code for 2017 (as per HK agreement). Then wait for all miners to upgrade, and reach the SegWit activation threshold of 95%. Then you will have SegWit live on mainnet. Sometime in 2017.

I agree here, it cannot be uninvented. (BTW, CAPEREADER, check your status, seems to me you are shadowbanned,  )

Blockchain is now at around 50GB. I can download it under a day, but it's not only download that takes time - blocks must be validated, saved to disk and indexed. That takes a lot of CPU processing and disk grinding (yes, I'm still on that old, spinning disks).

He understands, there is no  'bait-and-switch'. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:30:55
Their 'formal agreement' is just that "we support a SW+2MB HF compromise". Nothing formal in it. It says what they want, with very little of implementation details.

The support hashrate now is above 90%.

It wasn't done. If it was, and it was favorable to the LN, we woulld all know.
If you know otherwise, I would appreciate a link, please. I'm interested in this, too. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:26:59
Your personal node has NO consequence for miners. I don't know what BTU you are talking about, or what volume would 25% of nodes overtake. You seem have some very special representation of what Bitcoin is.

If exchanges  are not running UASF, they won't see your UASF chain, they will see the other chain. If you want UASF to succeed, you have to have exchanges on board before the action. And the miners. Ones more, individual nodes are irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:49:37
It will.

I saw that video when it came out, but 6 node graph can not be a 'scale simulation'. I read anything I can get on LN, but scale simulation I can not find any.


This is the comment under that video.

after 2016 blocks. it's 42 days with 30% hashrate. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 10:05:59
Explain, please? And remember that the point is to keep the 'hops' at minimum.
@_date: 2017-06-10 08:45:10


Only BIP148 enforcing nodes won't accept non-segwit blocks. All other nodes will.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:03:46


There is no need for lock-in, as signalling starts July 21st. By Aug 1st most other miners will join in. All signalling segwit bit. That's enough for BIP148 nodes to accept all blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:42:37
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:01:15
Oh shit, I misunderstood that! It must be active, of course!
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:42:03
BIP148 actually enforces only signaling bit for BIP141 (segwit). A node running BIP148 patch will reject a block that does not have that bit set in the header. It doesn't look at transactions.
With no hashrate behind BIP148 to actually enforce and extend that chain, all that BIP148 nodes will do is to cut themselves off the bitcoin network on Aug 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-29 11:55:03
So LN will be a few well connected nodes. Great that we are clear on this now.
@_date: 2017-06-10 15:06:31
I agree with that, but the talk above was all about BIP148 and UASF, before segwit is active.
