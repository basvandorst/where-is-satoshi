Here's the thing: if your bank account gets hacked (through Mint or anything else), yes, it will be inconvenient, but the charges will be eventually reversed. 
With Bitcoin, your money is gone. Forever. So you have to be extra cautious. 
So it's not that the API Key is worse than the username/password (it's pretty much the same), it's more that your account details for Bitcoin services need to be kept at a lot higher scrutiny than fiat.

This is still a huge security risk. See the comments on the last post on [Mint's forums](
And the [past thread]( on Reddit.

He means making a promo event about switching to T-Mobile based on the fact that Apple pulled the blockchain app, and attract a lot of the Bitcoin community. 
Do you work in the marketing dept at T-Mobile? I have another thing that I wanted to reach out to T-Mobile, actually. I'm in the Bellevue area near the HQ.

Thanks! Still doesn't explain the 33 emails ;]
I was really stunned when my phone started playing the "new mail" noise over and over.

(This isn't really a post about Coinbase; a transaction of 0.1 mBTC got sent to a bunch of different addresses...and I guess my Coinbase account had one or more of those addresses).
Here's the transaction on Blockchain...

This is what I have so far:

Oh awesome! I didn't find that when looking around. Let me take a closer look &amp; see how they do things &amp; if what I want to do is different in any way...

Another way to do it is to pool people's balances (like how the bots work), and only redeem from the balance if people claim, but I'm hesitant to handle a balance of other people's money when this would be more of a side project.

Yep! Had a brainstorming session on reddit [earlier]( and I ended up doing this implementation. 
Here's some differences: 
1. BCTip requires you to deposit the coins with them. They could lose your coin, although it's probably not likely. 
2. BCTips expire in 1 month. If you want to keep a few in your wallet, you have to keep generating BCTips, reprint them, and lose the transaction fee. With BitTip, you have to manually deposit your coin, but you can choose to withdraw them at any time if they go unused. 
3. BCTip has fixed qty / denomination. You can't change it to your own value. They also denominate in dollars, and show the exchange rate at the time of creating the BCTip. BitTip keeps everything in mBTC, so the focus isn't about the dollars. 
4. BitTip can be used offline. This is great if you're paranoid about security. 
5. BCTip does look a bit nicer =]

Thanks for the online tip =] I'll try to make this happen so you can do it IRL too.
The main thing I'm trying to understand right now is transaction fees; I've been using Coinbase so I don't quite understand how they work just yet. (I just want to make sure that sending lots of small tips to different wallets is feasable and won't eat up too much BTC in fees).

Hm. Did you see  posted above? It seems to solve what you want to do, although it doesn't address the security aspects. What're your thoughts? 
I'm trying to figure out what the start page for BCTip is (for the people getting tipped) and I'm not quite sure yet. Still doing research about the feasibility &amp; how I can make something that's useful and different to what's already there.

I'm currently playing around with the [BitAddress]( codebase. You can generate wallets purely offline with their system (if you download the HTML page). 
The main concern is yes, would people prefer to store the private keys themselves, or online? There's always a tradeoff between security and convenience...
There's already a bunch of websites that explain how wallets work &amp; etc; could you elaborate on what you mean by that?
