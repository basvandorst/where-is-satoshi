I wonder if early adopters got to keep some of those easy to get BTCs, it seems like most people to got BTC pre 2015 just spent them.

Not sure, but it might takes months to be approved.  Hopefully not.

No heart attacks, just accumulate, This is just a BTC promotion going on.  It is on sale right now.  In 2012  BTC dropped from $16 to $7, and lots of  people panicked, some sold at $7.  In 2013 from $259 to $68 people were panicking selling at $68, one day in the not so distant future we will be discussing how cheap bitcoin was at 2019 prices and feeling bad for those who sold at those prices.

Buy in small quantities so that if it goes down more you afford more.  It is on sale right now.

Put everything on BTC and postpone the wedding.

For 97% of crypto investors, you should never sell a single satoshi, just buy at dips.  I am telling from experience. I started in crypto in 2016 had I kept every BTC I purchased I would be a very happy man now.

You are awesome. I hope you get to keep some of those 2013 BTCs.
To my brother in 2013 I probably gave him some clothes, so there you have it, you are better than me. :)

I am surprised with how people are ok with this.  To me that’s like a car manufacturer tell me where I can drive to and where I can’t.

Wish I had seem this back then

Really wished I had seen this in 2014 instead of 2019.

Ain’t that the truth
