Lol, sorry if the low prizes offends you, but this being the first monthly contest, it's liable to need improvements for the coming months. Your criticism is heard though, next month, prizes will likely increase.

Fair enough, if the content submitted is below the standard I'm looking for, I will just have to adjust the prizes for next month. I appreciate your feedback, be sure to check in next month if you are interested.

After some thought, I changed my mind, prizes have been increased :)

It's totally normal that many are skeptical of Bitcoin, but soon with growing interest, people won't be able to ignore it. For every person I meet that is unwilling to learn about crypto, I find another who is. Give it time my friend, people are starting to see it popping up in different media sources.

Well fractional reserve banking simply allows way more spending in the economy which makes the economy faster in the now, but unstable in the future. Fractional reserve banking may speed the economy up, but I don't think this is a solution, I agree that it's a problem. I think if our debt was financed by the real amount of money or bitcoins then the economy will slow down, but at least be real. If the economy is actually realistic, it'll be more stable and robust.

It's about time, the reason for this regulation was to protect us from losing our money. However, gambling is totally legal, you can gamble you're entire life savings away and the government will earn a hefty tax on that loss. Seed investing has become one of the most lucrative investment classes and yet they reserved it for only the rich. The limits on the annual investment amounts are still dumb, but this is a major step forward. Now instead of gambling, those inclined to risk their capital can invest in the future of the country. Now only if Canada could smarten up and do this too.

Excellent response, thanks for clearing this up. It makes perfect sense that in a crypto economy there would be more conservative lending, yeilding better economic prosperity overall, without the boom and bust cycles we see. I've been asked about what the equivalent to credit card debt would look like, but I guess this would in the form of a pre-approved loan easy to access from the bank at whatever negotiated interest rate. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
