I was shocked when I first drove a Lamborghini at how stock everything was inside, my friends Mercedes c class had better features stock and a way better stereo, then again the lambo’s engine was so thunderous the stereo inside could have been decent I just couldn’t tell honestly. Lambos are fun to drive though, I wouldn’t drop a quarter mill on owning one though, renting them is plenty enough for me. They are great at traffic clearance in my state too people literally change lanes so you can pass them when they are in front of you hahaha some of the boss’st shit I’ve ever experienced

I know it’s not I couldn’t allow myself to buy one of these I’m happy with my Mercedes honestly and the warranty service from the dealership is unmatched. These exotics are great for renting IMO because for a few hundred buck I get to drive a different quarter of a million dollar car each weekend.

My guy I have massive empathy for you, the last time I was in a position where I was looking for a job I walked into a deli and I spoke with the owner and he blatantly told me I had to shave it to work for him and I blatantly told him he could go fuck him self. 
This was a pivotal moment in my life where I went from being Brian and became Brian Boss. ����

Lmfao I’m getting roasted, but this is a solid one.

Oh no I knew they tracked them I just couldn’t figure out how they knew I was speeding, but this makes sense, I’m surprised I didn’t realize this I’m retarded lmao 
@_date: 2019-03-10 18:42:49
Oh no! Just kidding I understand no problem my mods I’ll do better with my posting next time

No we were only told about it from the owner when we had to let him know about are accident, the Ferrari was dusted, if I remember right I think the only thing identifying from it was maybe some of the engine or frame from the pic we saw. Scary shit.

I’m honestly not ready for that one yet Hahahah 
I get wreck-less behind these, I was on the Garden State heading to Atlantic City with my boys and I put it down to 250mph so fucking dumb but YOLO 
I remember the rental owner texting me “SLOW THE FUCK DOWN!” I got spooked by it because I was in a completely different state and it was like 1am I’m still scratching my head wondering how the fuck the owner knew.
This was just months before my car wreck too, I wasn’t driving though and it wasn’t anything wreckless but also on the Garden State but this time leaving Atlantic City. 
Even more spooky my boys wanted to rent this Ferrari they had that was hooked all the way up, the steering wheel legit had a button that read “NOS” plus all these other insane add ons, flames shot out the pipe it was the type of shit you would see in a movie/carshow/magazine, it was New Year’s Eve 2013, we got stuck with an Aston Martin because somebody else reserved the Ferrari, we get in the wreck in the Aston Martin and the person that rented the Ferrari disintegrated it, I think the guy might have died honestly. Man memories.

@_date: 2019-01-21 16:44:29
I thought so too, saw it on the stand in Starbucks while waiting on line. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:04:37
Sorry about that it was just this cover page on the stand, somebody else must have snatched it lol
