It seems like people forget the risks after a constant stream of good news. Last year was great, but that doesn't mean bitcoin will keep doubling every few months (imagine that).

Good TA does get posted. It's just impossible to differentiate it from the bad ones. And besides, even the best traders make tons of mistakes, and constantly getting berated for the mistakes you make can be enough to convince you that it's just not worth it to post.
Posting doesn't get you any extra profits either, unless you somehow monetize it.
And third, the core of TA trading is personal choices: risk management (stop loss, what percentage of your stack to use), the type of trading (scalping, momentum trading, what time frames to use).
I can tell you to short here, because I'm really sure it will break support and go lower. But if you're planning to hold for a decade, buying here isn't that bad of an idea (but prepare to hodl through another 60% drop if that happens).
And for those wanting to learn day trading: don't use too much. You'll lose A LOT before becoming profitable. And don't think this doesn't apply to you.

I'm pretty sure the majority of households in the world still doesn't have a PC.

Except at some point people will be so burnt out that they stop, at which point the market ironically turns around.

These people are fudded out because of the 2008 recession.

At least you have a strategy lol. Most people just do whatever they feel like doing.

You mean you can't hodl for longer than two years? Also, redistributing wouldn't have any effect.
