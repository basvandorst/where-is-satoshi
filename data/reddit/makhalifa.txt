I'm not sure if it will but I'd be open to the idea if it gains more traction.

Side note - In December it was predicting a drop in January (1-2 weeks prediction) and we (friends and myself) all thought it had to be wrong because it was in the high 15-20K range and seemed to be. That's when I started to believe that it might actually provide another data point that people could use for their investment strategies on top of social or technology based reasons.

Still have to add non BTC* coins. All of the currencies so far are traded in BTC. Shouldn't take many changes to add LTCUSDT/BTCUSDT/ETHUSDT.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:15:52
Yes. One of the ways I've done this is chopping off the last few days or weeks of data that the model uses and running a predictive analysis up to current day, and then comparing it to real time prices.
Is this what you're referring to as far as information leakage?

What do you mean by metrics for valuation?
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:06:11
I've used a few GitHub projects as the basis for the model. Python and the US stock market have been around for a while so I tested a few different predictive analysis models based on the US stock market, but plugged in crypto data. 
That makes sense. Ive done a few front end projects so will probably use something like Charts.js or a similar library to show at least the Coinbase coin predictions (BTC/LTC/BCH/ETH). Can probably build it out from there.

No problem. It's not right now.
@_date: 2018-03-05 08:17:08
Thanks. Not yet that is something I plan to add.

It has a training and testing set of data and provides a confidence based on the training and testing size as well as the testing results (how close it was to being accurate).
I would agree that it's not applicable to a lot of other data types but if the forecasts are showing to be true I'm OK with that.

Part of the algorithm uses the [Facebook Prophet Model.](

Feel free to comment with any input on what you'd like to see. (i.e. hourly predictions vs daily or weekly? Graphs  vs. numbers?)
What is the best crypto resource right now for modeling predictions?
@_date: 2018-02-12 10:04:34
I do but it's private right now. There are a lot of predictive analysis projects on GitHub. I started off by finding ones with only a few files in the project I could get a full understanding without diving through tons of code.

I'm going to send out some of the models in a daily digest while I build out the website.

Which predictions? Hourly? Daily? Weekly? In terms of BTC in my wallet or total USD?
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:11:35
Thanks I really appreciate it. 
That's a good idea I'll be sure to add that to the first deploy of the site. I would probably start off with forecasts for the Coinbase coins (BTC/BCH/ETH/LTC) because they're relevant to the largest population of crypto users. 
Alt coins are a little bit more difficult because not every exchange has the same subset of alt coins and not all traders trade on all of the exchanges. I'll see if I can come up with a way for users to pick which alt coins they want in addition to the daily Coinbase coins.

What I'm referring to is if the trader/prediction model starts with 2.0 BTC at 10,000 USD I have 20,000 USD. When you buy an alt coin you (most likely) do it through a Bitcoin market. So I could predict a few alt jumps and have 2.1 BTC or 21,000 USD. Let's say the BTC USD price drops to 5,000 USD. I still have 2.1 BTC but now I only have 10,500 USD. 
I have more BTC than I when I started, but less USD. Was the prediction correct?
The same applies for trading BTC straight up. Are successes in that you have more BTC in your wallet at the end of a trade, or more USD?

Yep I will be posting on the sub once it's done.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:12:15
That could be built in.

I would recommend Python as a first language to 99% of people. Part of what makes programming exciting is being able to make something quickly that does something cool. 
Python has a ton of libraries and tutorials that make it easy for beginners to pick it up and learn how exactly to create something like a twitter bot or reddit scraper. You can create something cool in under 50 lines of code.

Right now it's using Binance and the Binance KLINE interval charts.[Binance Candles](
I've also ran the model using the Crypto Compare API which provides aggregate data across multiple exchanges for most of the currencies.
