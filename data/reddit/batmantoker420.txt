I came to the same conclusion as you through my beginnings of research on this crazy idea.  Thanks a lot!

I was offended by you accusing me of not understanding the basics of finance and investing.  I have stumble across $1000 that if gone tomorrow I'd feel no different so I would not be upset about its loss.  You accusing me of lying and not understanding what I'm doing is the only thing that upset me.

Could some sort of protection software be developed? Is that even possible? I'm a finance guy not a computer guy just asking general questions for curiosity sake

Bitcoin is not like apple, I am not sitting in my investments class discussing the value of bitcoin and who is investing in it etc.. I was asking as a 21 year old who is just beginning to understand the investment game.  I have superior math skills and am very much aware of the fundamentals of valuation, estimation of discount rates, cash flows, and the use of valuation tools when valuing common assets such as AAPL.  Bitcoin is a fucking bullshit cryptocurrency that has no bank backing it.  I wanted the opinion of others when formulating my own.  Bitcoin is not on the NYSE or any other fucking stock exchange.  It does not sell bonds or anything because it isn't a fucking company.  I can't emerse myself in bitcoin because there is not textbooks in this country that discuss it. I am not asking to quote you in my thesis I am genuinely interested in finding out the opinion of other people.  What is the point of this forum if I can't do that?  So sorry if you don't believe that I am a current student who showed promise in investment classes at my university and was brought under the wing of a president of a hedge fund to study valuation in more detail.

Right but figuring out its valuation doing simple arithmetic will tell give me a number, but I want to hear its potential

I am doing a complete study on bitcoin by studying damodaran book on valuation, then using his practices in the valuation of bitcoin.  I will then compare my results with its actual value.  I am in the very preliminary stages of this and wanted to see other points of view.  I am not lazy I am interested this stuff fascinates me.

Just an idea, but maybe create a BBB (better business bureau)  version of authentication for sites that do not steal? 
@_date: 2013-06-09 19:28:33
thats my opinion. I have a feeling that I will be more studying and following its progress academically then actively investing in it.  It seems that I have missed the train. oh well

Well obviously I'd assume you'd know more strictly from experience which brings me back to my original question of what do you think BitCoins prospects are (no need for an answer anymore). I pretty much have a grasp on the formal education side of investing and very limited grasp through its real life application through bullishit internships that were more a résumé builder then learning experience.  I'm not a huge fan of being told I not studying investments when I can prove that on the contrary. This is a useless conservation so I bid you farewell on your endeavors.

I can afford to lose $1000, I just want to know its potential prospects. Is this really a money making venture?  If I lose the money so be it, I just want to know if there is still capital in bitcoin.
