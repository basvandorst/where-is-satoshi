Bitcoins can be divided to arbitrary denominations.

If you're going to be pedantic, at least be correct.
kill, destroy, or remove a large percentage or part of.

kill one in every ten of (a group of soldiers or others) as a punishment for the whole group.

I'm happy Bing is at least competitive with Google.
Right now Google is doing lots of great things, but who knows what that company will be like in 10+ years. It's dangerous to allow a single company so much control over the internet.

Don't act like you're mining out of the goodness of your heart. You're doing it for a profit. You knew what you were getting into.

There's nothing wrong with (modern) PHP. You can write good code, or bad code, there just happens to be more bad code written in PHP due to the low barrier of entry.

I don't understand? Are you suggesting you can't be anonymous when using Bitcoin? It takes work but it's perfectly doable.

Electron wallet is susceptible to hackers, a hardware wallet isn't.

Ethereum mining also favors memory access over raw computation so underclocking the GPU doesn't have much of an effect. When Bitcoin was mined on GPUs it was common to overclock.

Assuming a relatively new SSD, you have nothing to worry about from writing. You will upgrade your drive long before it dies from write wearing.

Can someone explain something for me. If I buy some shares on btct what would happen if btct closed down tomorrow? What exactly do you receive when you buy a share?
@_date: 2013-08-25 04:09:00
That doesn't mean the mining is unprofitable. Both methods would generate a profit. Though I agree just buying them is easier.

A hash is a a small string of characters that can represent a larger block of data. Think of it as a table of contents to a book. The main thing about a hash is if you change even a single bit of information in the original block of data, the entire hash changes completely. This allows you to verify the original contents of a message by comparing its hash with the expected hash. If the message has been altered, the hash will be different.
For example, the MD5 hash of the string "The world is round." is "f728405e73e7b752c8f822f8b5c51e3a".
While the string "The world is flat." is d68dee6ae3a6e9e11c6c376be9673c09".

I'm guessing these rates were posted when BTC was about $300 a coin. Even then that's pretty steep for what you're getting though.

He didn't say the reason for the calculation is arbitrary, just the calculation its self (which it is).
