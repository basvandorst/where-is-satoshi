If someone wants to pay you, you have a robust item that has your qr on it. incase your phone is dead. Just a way to have access for someone to pay you anywhere anytime.

i lost 1.54 btc elsewhere but i feel your pain. And I cant wrap my head around how they just close shop, and expect everyone to just swallow the loss. it literally is like removing a complete community's worth of housing/savings/earnings and say.... "deal with it. Start over. Hopefully somewhere else doesnt treat you the same."

I formatted my HD, and copied both doge and bit folders seperately. then on the fresh win7ultimate64, i downloaded the new qt wallets, and once i opened them for the first time, I closed them, and then copy and pasted my old folders into the appdata new folders... but i think i pasted my dogecoin info into my bitcoin appdata folder. weird how it thinks its the same.
