And most of that is suicides (about 2/3) and the rest is mostly done by criminals, who already are bared from owning guns legally *and* in gun control states, mostly California, NY and Illinois. Do you honestly think, that adding 2 more laws for criminals to break will do anything?


The point of referring to terrorist attacks is to highlight how futile anti-gun-laws are. France is heavily gun controlled, didn't keep the terrorists in Paris from committing their acts using fucking full-auto AK-47's and grenade launchers.

If they are informed, they won't try to ban bitcoin, because they know they can't ban bitcoin. If they ban it and it doesn't work, which it won't, then the confidence to safeguard your capital in the ultimate off-shore tax-haven country "blockchain" increases exponentially. 
From the states perspective, tactically it's much more preferably, if the general public believes as long as possible, that they *could* ban it at any moment.
Even more corrupt banana-republics that already banned bitcoin will jinx it for more sophisticated states, tough.

Then write down or print out the address and the private key you used.
To send to the the paper wallet, you can create on a secure online computer an Electrum wallet with individual private keys to import. Like, don't go through the "seed creation process", but select the option to import individual addresses and keys. Into that import the current private key and send to your new paper wallets address. If you used the bech32 format for the new paper wallet, you'll have to use the recent version of Electrum.

I don't think that's possible on-chain. Just do the math yourself. At 200 bytes per transaction, how large would blocks have to be in order to full-fill ACH payments, SEPA payments and VISA/Mastercard payments. Once you did that, and you're willing to exclude casuals from running a fully-verifying node, would your average gaming-pc with one or two high end graphic cards, 16 to 64 GB of RAM, octa-core CPU etc. be able to do the job?

btw, blockchain.info is a horrible wallet. In terms of security and fees. You should switch to a SegWit enabled wallet like Greenbits on Android or BitWallet on iOS.

My academic credentials are probably higher than yours, but I'm not in for e-penis competition here.
The scientific method works, but my point was, and I'm surprised you didn't get it, because you seem to be so well educated, that the stats cited aren't overly scientific. Once you control for socio economic factors, gun ownership turns out to be mostly irrelevant, in both directions.
The point about North Korean vehicular deaths is, that of course a country like North Korea will have fewer car-related deaths, than a country like, say South Korea, because it's not as likely to be killed in a car accident, if almost nobody has a car. So yes, people in the UK don't get shot as often (although more often since gun control was enacted), but they get stabbed and blown up more. And they are getting thrown acid into their faces more often.
Why people have such a hard-on for *how* people get killed, is beyond me. If you get mauled by a Jihadi in a truck or gunned down by mad-man doesn't make much difference. And gun laws, or truck-laws, won't stop one or the other.

@_date: 2018-01-02 15:55:25
No. How did you read that from what what I wrote?
Absolute price doesn't matter for "store of value". That's just as retarded as unit-bias (i.e. "1 BTC is so expensive, I can't buy that, but one mBTC, now that sounds fine", which is probably the number one reason for newbs that buy into alts, because of that "upwards potential".) What matters is the relative price increase over time. So it doesn't matter if you buy BTC at $14'000 or $14 or $0.14. What matters is how much it's worth *X* years from now. Given a long enough time frame, BTC is a very good store of value right now. Sure, it can drop hard fast, but on 1 year+ time frames, it's very good.
The fact that the protocol is practically unchangeable adds to that store-of-value-property. Nobody wants to store value in a network that can its rules changed every 5 minutes.

Most of these studies have been either debunked or they refused to provide their data. They aren't overly scientific.

You've got all examples, high gun ownership, low homicide (like Plano, TX), high gun ownership, high homicide (I don't know an example, if you know one, let me know), little gun ownership, low homicide rate (like Japan) and little gun ownership, high homicide rate (like Caracas, Venezuela).

Generally using your everyday Windows/Mac/Linux computer, and on top of that, a web browser to host your wallet is just asking for getting your BTC stolen.
I also have the suspicion, that they are actively rebroadcasting very-low fee transactions to clog the mempool. What I've noticed from posts on r/bitcoin, is that people who have their txs stuck for unusual long amounts of time, like a month+ are all using blockchain.info as their wallet.
Just like Coinbase, I regard Blockchain.info as anti Bitcoin and pro Btrash.

Do you honestly believe, that with the amount of demand bitcoin sees, on-chain-fees would be lower on other chains, *with the same amount of decentralization*?
Everybody gets, that you can have basically cost-of-electricity low transaction-fees, but that comes at a hidden cost: increasingly higher counter-party risk.
Every "crypto-currency" that tries to compete with low-fee, fast-transaction is bound to fail, because a centralized solution like PayPal, GoldMoney.com etc. will always be orders of magnitude faster and cheaper.
The best way for the future, is having Bitcoin be the money which is transacted using various payment methods and currencies. LN is one method.
Think about gold. One gram of gold costs about $40 right now and it's about as big as a thumbnail. Buying coffee for $4 with that is highly impractical. Doesn't mean gold is a bad money. But it's a bad *currency*. That's why you use a paper currency, or some other payment method to transact gold.
Same goes with bitcoin, only with one giant upgrade to gold: you can have currencies and payment methods on top of bitcoin, without counter-party risk, if you prefer. Or you can opt for ease of use and expose yourself to more counter-party risk. It's up to you.
Trading cost of transaction and counter-party-risk on the base layer is stupid.

SegWit is fully backwards compatible. You can send to and from SegWit addresses any way you like. The only reason why it couldn't work, is because the wallet, exchange, whathaveyou, isn't bech32-compatible yet. That's why BIP49, the P2SH-version of SegWit addresses exist. They aren't as efficient as bech32 addresses, but every wallet, exchange, etc. recognizes the format.
If you aren't in a hurry with transferring your BTC to a new paper wallet, I would wait until bech32 is more widely used.

Your ignorance is showing. BTC transactions aren't big or small because of the amount you send, it's the size in bytes that matters. A $3 transaction can have 100 inputs, making the transaction large in size and thus expensive, while a $10 million can have 1 input and be very small and thus cheap.
What makes you think the bitcoin network can't process your transaction? All you have to do is click send it will do so. But nowhere is it written, it must be done under a certain USD value. That would instantly nullify the value proposition of bitcoin, because it could only be done with arbitrarily large blocks, which then lead to only big server farms confirming the blockchain.

You can leave your money on the exchange for a while. Accumulate a relevant amount and in the meantime, you can order a hardware wallet like Trezor. I'd withdraw to the wallet at around $500 to $1000.

1) Make sure you are using SegWit, addresses starting with 3.

That's not true. If block space is available, it will get used. People would find all sorts of stuff to do with blockspace, like hosting files, making asset-management on it and so on. The price per transaction would literally go to the same level until it is not profitable any longer to do these transactions.


Well, maybe if Jihan wouldn't have stalled SegWit-activation for just as long and Coinbase, Bitpay and the other NYA-scum wouldn't have wasted core-developers time and resources to code against a contentious hardfork, it would be ready by now.
Don't forget: Bitcoin is the enemy for a lot of people. Many want to fight, or at least stall it.


The value of gold for its industrial and ornamental usage is only a fraction of its speculative/store of value price. Something has to have some sort of *initial* usage to be traded in a barter-economy-way. After that if that something has superior qualities as store of value, it can be that. Also, only because bitcoin isn't ideal to make low priced transactions, doesn't mean it has *no* usage. Again, something has to have only one usage at all to *enter* the economy. After that, medium of exchange, store of value and later money, can be its sole usage.
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:28:37
You have to compare apples to apples. ~10 tx/s on-chain should really be compared to bank settlements. For that, that's remarkably high.
If you have custodial accounts, i.e. bitcoin-banks like Coinbase, transaction speed is practically infinite. Much faster than bank-customer to bank-customer transactions, which are the counter-part to custodial accounts.
And with 2nd layer solutions like LN, you get a mix of both. Non-custodial, yet almost infinite transaction speed. Probably not as convenient as custodial accounts, but also not as inconvenient as on-chain.
Bitcoin is technology, it's a protocol, so it gives you choices. Like TCP/IP. You can order a DVD on Amazon, stream from Netflix or torrent a file. All is done over TCP/IP, all have different strengths and weaknesses.

You are wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:03:27


I didn't think it is. But I don't know what else to say about it. 
The number one use case for bitcoin is store of value, because it can't be stolen (if you do it right) and it can't be inflated away. You can cross any border with it without anybody knowing, because you store them in your brain, or transact across borders, without anybody being able to restrict you.
All the "this store and that online-merchant"-accepts bitcoin is nice, but really not a big deal. I love bitcoin and even when transactions were practically free, I almost never bought stuff with it. Because I buy something and I also have to login to an exchange and instantly rebuy what I just spent, because I don't want the $8 pizza cost me $12 in a month. 
So as much as I hate the legacy banking system, for day to day usage, it's unbeatable and this is not where bitcoin has the highest comparative advantage.
Once many people have bitcoin and it makes sense to accept it as payment in a larger scale, then the next step, currency, will make sense. But that's a long way. For one, the price has to stabilize somewhere, because nobody will spend the appreciating money.

Blockchain has one of the worst wallets out there. They have a terrible security record. On top of that, you're paying using credit card within the blockchain-info-wallet, and the fees are very high using that.
Use a real exchange, preferably Bitstamp.net because of their support for SegWit and use a SegWit enabled wallet.
You should switch to a SegWit enabled wallet. Exodus has horrible security, and doesn't support SegWit.
SegWit-enabled wallets are for example:
* Android: Greenbits
* iOS: BitWallet¹ ( 
* Desktop and Cold Storage: Electrum².
* Hardware wallet: Trezor.io
Make sure the address starts with a 3 and not with a 1 to get SegWit. It cuts down on your transaction cost and speeds up transactions.
1: You have to add a SegWit-address manually and write the private key on paper to make a backup.
2: Be aware that Electrum uses the new bech32-address format for SegWit (starts with bc1) which is not very wide spread at the moment and most other wallets don't recognize bech32 as a valid address format.

The tutorial builds bitcoin-qt from the sources and installs them into `/usr/local/bin`. If you still have the source lying around, you can go into that directory and as root issue `make uninstall`. This should remove the program again. If not, you can manually delete all the bitcoin-stuff from `/usr/local` or simply upgrade the source directory and build from the sources again.

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:21:33
* Android wallet: Greenbits, Samourai Wallet if you're brave enough. I haven't tested Atlana, which seems to be a Greenbits clone.
* iOS wallet: Greenaddress.
* Desktop wallet, also for cold storage: Electrum (bech32 addresses), Bitcoin Armory
* Paper wallet generator:  and  although I'd love to get feedback on how trustworthy those are. Bitaddress.org has a great track record, but no segwit unfortunately.
No matter what you decide on, make sure you are using SegWit-adresses. The format starting with `3...` is more compatible right now. The new bech32-address format isn't wide spread right now.

Breadwallet lacks features that minimize fees, like SegWit and adjustable fees. But hey, it has cool animations when you open the settings dialog. Great job, breadwallet devs.

It doesn't support SegWit or custom-fees. People really should start switching to SegWit wallets. I'd leave my non-segwit balances alone and withdraw newly bought BTC to a SegWit wallet from now on. Once fees come down, transfer everything to SegWit

If you use SegWit-addresses, you will get charged a lower fee when you send the bitcoins at some point. They are more efficiently utilizing blockchain-space and are thus cheaper.

Don't use the blockchain.info wallet, on any device. They have a horrible security track record and do not support SegWit addresses (yet).

Again, for which thing is this not the case? If suddenly nobody was able to buy oil, the same thing would happen. That's what markets are for. And whatever the reason is for why fiat-liquidity into bitcoin goes down, it's much more easily routed around that reason using a distributed system like Bitcoin.




Sure, you can give someone physical gold, face to face. But as soon as you want to do that over a distance, you've got a problem. Also very small or very large amounts are much more complicated and dangerous using gold than using bitcoin.


I think you put too much trust into the government. This is not needed for bitcoin to be liquid or valuable.

Okay, here it is: hodl. 
All altcoins are scams. Don't believe me? Believe the math: 
All the "problems" bitcoin has and some alts claim to solve aren't solved by them. They are either completely centralized, like Ripple, or the only reason why they don't have the same problems, is because nobody uses them.
Here's a tip I give everyone who thinks about buying alts: Run a full-node of the altcoin. See what's up. How large are the blocks? Is anyone actually using them? Is it even feasible for you to run a node? If not, what does that say of its decentralization or lack thereof?

Definitely Coinbase. Using the Samourai wallet, sending would cost me about $1 or so right now. You are bailing that company out.
They were too negligent on implementing SegWit and transaction batching and have now over 3 million USD worth of BTC in legacy addresses with balances lower than the average transaction fee.
If I had funds in Coinbase, I'd convert them all into LTC, transfer to for example HitBTC.com, convert back to BTC and withdraw to my cold storage.

Yes, with LN fully deployed and user friendly, we will enter a new era.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:39:24
You open a channel, that's an on-chain transaction and costs a fee.
Then you send LN transactions through the channel, these are free or virtually free (like a fraction of a penny).
After a while, lets say months or years, you close the LN channel and the final balance settles again on-chain.
Because transaction demand, especially for small transactions, is shifted from on-chain to off-chain, the overall demand for on-chain transactions goes down and so does the price.
I don't believe that u/BCHisrogerscoin has a crystal ball to predict the price of bitcoin, or of an on-chain transaction months into the future. The name suggests he's a Bcash shill and is trying to spread FUD about Bitcoin.

You can increase the fee, which you don't want to do which is understandable or you simply wait. After a while the transaction gets deleted from the mempool. The bitcoins are still "in" your Mycelium wallet. So either the transaction goes through, or it gets dropped.

Yes, it is a good desktop wallet and it has SegWit, but the address format they are using is very new and most other wallets and exchanges don't recognize it.


No. I would strongly advise against that. Smartphones/tablets are much more secure. "Pocket change" is okay to have on a secure online device, like in Greenbits on your Android smartphone.

You probably should spend from individual UTXO's.
I don't know how the Bitcoin-QT wallet does that, but if you create an Electrum wallet from a single address, you can add the tab "Coins" and spend from UTXO's you select.
You could use something like that to bundle UTXO's together, but not all of them, so the transaction doesn't become too large.
But definitely double check this, because I have never made a transaction in such a way. I guarantee nothing.

Don't invent your own crypto.
If you want to secure the seed in the safe deposit box, encrypt it, done from a completely air gapped and permanently offline computer.
On Linux, you can use `gpg` in symmetric mode and ASCII-armor the output using for example these parameters:
`gpg -a -v --output output-file.asc --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-mode 3 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 65600000 seed.txt`
The output is only a few lines of text, easily printable and typeable should you have to recover from it.
Creating a secure and easily typed password can be done for example by using this command:
`head -c 16 /dev/random | base64 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -d '[:punct:]'`
You can write this on paper and hand it over to your family.

A large portion of blockspace is used by exchanges like Coinbase and they haven't implemented SegWit yet.
Other than that, most users simply use whatever is default and most wallets by default don't use SegWit yet. 
In a sense, we are in a similar situation like we were a few years ago, where not first informing yourself and reading up on stuff will cost you money. That comes with taking care of your own financial sovereignty and bitcoin as a whole still being a young project.

Bitcoin is anti-fragile. Nothing works long term to stop it.
What *really* would be a hindrance to bitcoins dominance, is if a nuclear sovereign abolishes all AML/KYC laws, institutes a 100% gold backed currency and punishes fractional reserve banking by death. Then the use case for bitcoin is moot, but on the other hand, the good guys would have won at that point.

Mycelium used to be great, but they're lagging behind in the develpments of bitcoin. They don't support SegWit and there's no annoucnemnt on how long it will take them to impliment it.
Here's what I would recommend:
* Android wallet: Greenbits
* iOS wallet: Greenaddress or BitWallet ( BitWallet requires you to write down the actual private key, it's not deterministic but looks to be fine. You have to add a SegWit address manually and write its private key down.
* Ultimatley, you probably want a hardware wallet like Trezor.io.
No matter what you decide on, make sure you are using SegWit-adresses. The format starting with `3...` is more compatible right now. The new bech32-address format isn't wide spread right now.

The price of bitcoin is determined by supply and demand, like everything else too. If there is demand for bitcoin, for example to secure your wealth in a non-confiscationable, inflation-resistant way, then that's one side of the supply-demand-curve. 
The supply is fixed.
The question is, do you think the demand for non-inflationary, unconfiscatable store of value will go up, or down in the future?
And then, does bitcoin provide a solution for this demand?

I don't know, if coins.ph connects that address forever with your account. You should ask their support if you can re-use deposit addresses.


You have to have a wallet that holds the private keys.
I would only use a smartphone or tablet as the host device, or a hardware wallet.
Three things are very important:
1) Write the recovery seed on paper and store it securely with your other important documents.
2) The wallet must be a SegWit enabled wallet. SegWit addresses start with `3...` or `bc1...`, *not* with `1...`. For Android I can recommend Greenbits and Samourai Wallet. For iOS I can recommend BitWallet¹ (
3) If you are going to transfer small amounts, let's say below 500 to 1000 USD worth, I'd keep that on the hosted wallet for now, until the mempool clears out a little.
1: You have to add a SegWit-address manually and write the private key on paper to make a backup.

@_date: 2017-12-17 16:11:05
I think so.
Many people don't get the difference between money and currency. In your analogy, gold is the money and paper-certificates for gold is the currency. The currency has to be backed by gold and is only there to make transacting gold more convenient and secure. How inconvenient would it be, to buy a coffee with physical gold? Not very.  1 gram of gold buys you about 10 coffees. The problem with gold is, it's physical so you have counter-party risk, when depositing into a bank-vault and receiving currency for it.
The cool thing about is bitcoin, because it's programmable money, the currency to make transacting the money, will be pegged to it. So you won't have to store your bitcoins in a bank with counter-party risk, i.e. someone who can run away with your money, but still be able to conveniently transact.

You won't be able to. But not only not for bitcoin, for nothing. There are no guarantees. If you want guarantees, buy stock in companies that will get bailed out by the government should they fail. But this "guarantee" comes at a price. Propping up something that's worthless (or else the company wouldn't have gone out of business) brings the value of whatever is used to prop it up (USD) down. So again, no guarantees, even guarantees are no guarantees.

So? That doesn't mean he gave up possession of the taxi. Also, the producer of something isn't necessarily the owner of that. In a modern economy, that's actually pretty rare. Most stuff is produced in contract for someone else.
The comparison between releasing a protocol like bitcoin and a physical object like a taxi and then comparing possession of both is also wrong, because you can't own an idea. Copyright, patents and other forms of so called "Intellectual Property" are in contradiction to property rights. Read "Against Intellectual Property" by Stephan Kinsella on the topic of IP.
If someone actually builds a self-driving, self-maintaining taxi and releases it into the wild, giving up possession of it, it's like unclaimed land and can be repossessed by the first person who does so.

It very much didn't. While most other cryptos are a copy-paste clone of bitcoin with trivial changes like shorter blocktime, larger block size, bitcoin, or rather the core developers, are on the cutting edge of mathematical and cryptographic research and development. 
For example: Yesterday I rewatched one of the first lectures on Schnorr signatures and these guys and girls have to literally first mathematically prove that they are secure when applied to elliptic curves over finite fields. Then they have to draft a digital signature standard for Schnorr, then they can start thinking about how to use them specifically for Bitcoin and then they can actually implement it in code. Stuff like this is actual innovation, long term scaling, future prove and worth my investment money.

Please do the math. Do you think that an 8x increase in blocksize would actually make a dent if the adoption rate is exponential? If people actually used Bcash, Litecoin, Feathercoin, whatever-coin, the blocks would be just as full and transactions would be just as expensive. With one exception: If blocks become increasingly bigger, which leads to increasing centralization and kills the *only* value proposition of a blockchain.
Fast and cheap transaction is done better with centralized solutions. Immutability and censorship-resistance is better done with a blockchain, but it comes at a cost.
If you throw in the towel, go ahead. But Bitcoin hasn't even reached its full potential as a simple store of value yet (i.e. gold in vaults). The next stop is making transacting better (i.e. gold backed currency). Lightning Network is one approach.

It depends on which race you are watching to determine if it will be number one or not.
It will be number one in terms of censorship resistance, immutability and decentralization and I think that this is the reason why it will always be the number one in price long term.
It won't necessarily be number one in easy of use, cost of transacting, speed, adoption etc. A decentralized crypto-currency probably never will. In these areas, centralized solutions are much better and for technical reasons, always will be. Any crypto-currency trying to enter the market of say, PayPal, will just become more like PayPal, only shittier.
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:32:45
No wonder, exchanges like Coinbase simply offload the cost on their customers, many wallet developers haven't implemented fee-reducing measures like adjustable fees, good fee estimation algorithms that let the user easily balance between cost and speed and segwit.
Bitcoin works so great, that many people forget it's still a baby and heavily under development.

It's going to take time. Bitcoin will be the base-layer of the global financial structure. It's just a truism that global scaling can not be on-chain. Whatever 2nd layer solutions will be dominant will end the phase. To be honest, and I said that years ago, I'd be fine with bitcoin-banks, where you transfer a certain amount, not your life savings, to a service provider and then from there you make transactions off-chain. That bank then settles every day or so for all its customers. And this isn't a contradiction with the before claim of trying to destroy the fiat-money system. Banks aren't evil per se. Fractional reserve banking and unlimited money supply is. And bitcoin ends that, one way or another.
Of course LN is much more elegant than simple custodial banks, so that's going to play a major role.

I don't think that the influx of normies/NPCs and the shitcoin Bonanza is a coincidence.
We're still in the accumulation phase, until the influx of new people doesn't 20x the price over one year.
Good news, if you still have fiat left to invest, I guess.
Edit: also, don't forget that bitcoin hasn't been under the attack of a Nation State yet. So actual broader market usage or not, trying to fix the transaction cost by increasing the block size indefinitely is the easiest way to centralize bitcoin. The state would literally only have to spam the blocks. No mining or node hardware even needed.

Market cap is the dumbest metric you could be looking at, second only to price of one (arbitrary) unit (like "uh, 1 BTC is so expensive, but 1 Shitcoin is only $0.10, so I'll buy that, it's cheaper").
Alice can at any point in time create Alice-Coin. She pre-mines 100 million Alice Coins and sells one of those to Amanda for $1. Wow! Alice Coin has now a market cap of 100 million USD! And look, BTC's relative market cap went down as a consequence.
Bob too can create Bob-Coin, he does the same, again bringing BTC's relative market cap down.

 is one less way to attack the system.

Coinbase is to Blockchain what AIDS is to cancer. It's also not a wallet, but a bitcoin-bank.
If the blockchain-info-wallet has a 12 word recovery seed, you should be able to use the same 12 words in Mycelium or Copay.
But, your bitcoins are still in a non-seg-wit-address. So make your next transaction count and send it to a seg-wit-wallet. 
If I were you, I'd wait for things to blow over with doing so.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:55:59


Yes, I think so. There's a lot of optimization to be done. Just recently someone discovered a way to make LN ramps for a fraction of the cost it would cost by simply committing with a transaction on-chain. But that stuff is really complicated and has to be discussed and tested very carefully.


I don't know. I'd say no, because that would probably be a regulatory nightmare due to the TOR-like routing functionality of LN. I think this will be more of a distributed network, like the TOR-network is now. Google doesn't do TOR-nodes. So Coinbase probably won't do LN-nodes. 
To be honest, I'm all for LN, but I also don't think that custodial wallets, i.e. bitcoin banks, are the devil. I'm sure there's a way to have a multi-sig-setup which makes them exit-scam/hack-free and still feels and works like grandma's good old e-banking.

Block space is not the only metric that counts. 
Latency is important too. Every second a miner takes longer to accumulate transactions into the block he's going to mine, costs him money.
So even with "large"^({8 or even 32 MB isn't even large, if you're talking about a scaling solution, that's still a drop in the ocean}) blocks, miners are going to prioritize transactions with relatively high fees and not simply fill the blocks up all the time. 
Which means, if you look at the data, that the average fee for BCH transactions in the last 12 hours was 7.43 sat/b and that for BTC was 17.72 sat/b.
But, on average there were only 102 transactions in the BCH block, while BTC had 1649 transactions.
So you have a 16x higher transaction count but only a 2.3x higher transaction cost.
In other words, blockspace is used about 7x more efficient in BTC than on BCH.
The higher the transaction count in BCH goes, the less true this becomes, but that's then becoming an apples to oranges comparison. BTC block-space allocation and BCH block-space allocation, byte for byte, will always fall in favor for BTC, because BCH is inferior and doesn't allow for SegWit and other (future) optimizations. But muh blockspace. Well, thank god they increased their block size for that bitch ass 100 transactions they've got going for them.

If you are talking about a P2SH-SegWit address (i.e. starting with 3), here's what I do to transact from single private keys:

Step two: import the private key into bitcoin-qt using `importprivkey LthePrivKey33rfafafadf LabelLikePaperWalletdezember false`.
Step three: in bitcoin-qt `addwitnessaddress 1addressCopiedFromBitaddress4fXf`
Step four: rescan

Or if you think what Ethereum does has a future, bet on that horse.

That's really secure. Assuming the entropy of the passphrase is high enough and with redundant backups of the encrypted keys and the passwords, you can probably store as much as you're able to acquire on it.
Here are a few suggestions tough:
1: Many different sources of entropy. Dice are cool. But why not also use the RNG of the computer you're using for bitaddress, plus the wiggle-RNG of bitaddress (for example copying one private key from that), plus you frantically typing on the keyboard. All that together with the dice rolls concatenated into the BrainWallet text-field, i.e. sha256'ed together. Biases and weaknesses in one or more entropy source are then mitigated by having a few other entropy sources mixed in.
2: Using paper wallets or single keys like that, means that sooner or later, the unencrypted private key will be in one single place. Right then and there, it might be attacked. Using multisig-wallets does mitigate that. For example, having a 2-of-4-multisig setup. You go to place 0, make the unsigned transaction. Then you go to place 1 and sign it. Both the key you extracted from place 1 and the partially signed transaction is worthless per se. Now you go to place 2 and sign it again *and send the transaction out that moment*. Again, the key and the transaction per se are still worthless for the attacker. Compare that to you going to your bank safe deposit box carrying a 10 million dollar paper wallet around.
 is definitely worth a read or two, to be aware of various attack vectors, even if you don't use the Glacier protocol.
I personally think a variation of the Glacier protocol, using Electrum multi-sig wallets instead of single private keys, is the most secure way to do it. Messing around with single private keys and manually created transactions makes me nervous about me accidentally sending 99% of the funds as fee to the miner because I made an error when converting from BTC to satoshi or dumb shit like that.

Because if the miners collude, it's deterministic who gets the fees: everybody. There is no risk any longer, to spam the mempool.
Using the lottery, even if they collude, the colluding pools would have to mine at a higher difficulty to get the spam-fees back. The regular difficulty, leading zeros of the block-hash, plus trailing ones of the block hash.
*Not* colluding is now more lucrative, because the non-colluding miner mines at a lower difficulty, at least as long as the block reward without fees is high enough.

On a blockchain that has actual usage, blocks will always be full. No matter what the size is, it will be filled. If for nothing else, then to encode ASCII-art lolcats in OP_codes and dumb Satoshi-dice games, because why not?
And as long as the non-SegWit-transaction percentage is &gt;1%, nobody can *ever* complain about high fees^1 anyway. That's literally like waiting for the bus that is sort of full, but all seats are taken, yet you could easily fit inside if you stand. If you then say "nah, I'm going to wait for the next bus", then obviously you have other priorities. That's okay, but complaining about how you didn't get on the bus, because you're too lazy to stand, is not okay.
1: It's also sort of amusing when people complain about "high fees". One can only assess if something has a high cost vs. a low cost, if you compare it with something that warrants comparison. So what's the other worldwide, immutable, uncensorable transaction network with built in inflation resistant  monetary policy they're comparing bitcoin to and what does a transaction on it cost?

From a technological standpoint, no. I don't think that 2MB blocks would fry the system. Sure, nodes who are on the margin in terms of ressources would drop, but overall, that wouldn't be such a great concern.
What hard-fork-happy folk don't realize is, that the *only* value proposition of bitcoin is it's immutability. The fact that transactions can't be reversed and the fact that the rules that govern these transactions can't be changed, except if you want to make them *stricter*. For example, the fact that a miner *could* pay himself a 1000 BTC coinbase transaction (instead of the currently 12.5 BTC), but would get his block rejected by the rest of the network because it would violate the 21mil max-consensus rule, is such a value proposition. 
A hard-fork makes these rules less strict. *If* it were easy to loosen the rules, bitcoin would lose what makes it valuable against all other things. Because if it's easy to change the blocksize to 2MB, what's the harm? Let's do it. Why not? It's just 1 MB more... then loosening all rules is easy. It's a "benevolent dictator" sort of thing. Sure, if we had a benevolent dictator like Ethereum has, changing the rules every two weeks would be easy. But it would also mean, the blockchain isn't immutable anymore. And what is "benevolent" is also highly subjective.
You want changes that make Bitcoin less restrictive, those are called hard forks, to be almost impossible to go through. That's not a weakness, it's the utmost strength of Bitcoin against all other forked or kickstarted altcoins.
Now that the blocks are filling up and transactions are becoming more expensive, developers will engineers around that problem, but leaving the base-layer untouched.
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:16:42


Yes. I realize there are at least 1000 shitcoin-tokens for DAPPS nobody uses. Good observation. The one DAPP that actually was used for a little while, CryptoKitties, completely fubar'd the ETH-blockchain.


Again, you have to understand the fundamentals. Currency is not the same as money. Currency is a tool that allows people to more easily transact money. Whatever *you* think will be the currency used *instead* of BTC, is wrong. The currency itself is/will be worthless, but will allow access to BTC. For example: OpenDime. That little USB-drive-like thing is practically worthless (actually it's like $15). I can put $10k worth of BTC on it and hand it to you. Did I pay you in OpenDime? No. I payed you in BTC, using OpenDime.


The fact that you think that rapidly adding functions to the baselayer of the monetary base of the world shows how infantile you are. I hope that almost nothing gets added to Bitcoin. And the stuff that gets added is hopefully tested years in advance.

You might need a `walletpassphrase 'your_SuperSecure-Passphrase' 500` to unlock the wallet for 500 seconds.
Then sweep that key into Coinomi on Android or ElectronCash ( on your Desktop-system. You might want to install ElectronCash in a virtualmachine, like Ubuntu inside VirtualBox, because I don't trust that software.
You can exchange BCH for BTC at HitBTC.com or ShapeShift.io. I think HitBTC.com is a little cheaper. Crypto to crypto is also without any restrictions.
You can do the same for Bgold too. Just sweep the keys another time into a Bitcoin Gold account on your Coinomi wallet.

Now look at the pool distribution: 
A smallish pool, or 2 small pools can easily pull it off. I'm actually wondering why they aren't.
All you have to do, is
* send BCH to an exchange, meanwhile covert-mining an alternative chain in which you never sent the BCH
* exchange for BTC. Extract BTC to own wallet.
* take out huge short positions against BCH
* publish alternative chain, demonstrating a successful double-spend attack and most likley driving BCH's price down, resulting in even higher returns thanks to the short positions.
* repeat until dumping your BCH for real doesn't even matter anymore

That every crypto-currency that has the userbase of bitcoin runs into the same wall. I can only employ you to start running your own full-node of whatever crypto you might think does it better than bitcoin. You'll notice one of two things:
**Either**, nobody is using it. For example Litecoin and also Bcash. Sync the node fully, go offline for a month, resync and you'll see, it takes hardly any time to catch on. Do the same with Bitcoin and you'll notice how long it takes. Why? because people are actually using it.
**Or**, the parameters are so screwed up, that you and nobody else who's not in a data-center can actually run a node, which means that crypto-coin could just as well be a centralized server, which would make it much faster and cheaper to run.
For real *trustless* scaling, there is no other way than 2nd layer solutions like Lightning Network. I'm confident that it will hit mainnet in 2018 and it will blow us all away. I've tested it on testnet and it's amazing.
If for whatever reason LN is dead on arrival, which I doubt, but if it is, bitcoin still is the best *money* out there, because its rules are so hard to change, making it the hardest money ever. We, humanity, then probably will have do something like we did under the gold standard: deposit the money in trusted vaults and transact using currency. Still much better than the fiat, fractional reserve banking debacle that's ruining the world today.

They missed the boat on optimizations like SegWit, transaction-batching and minimizing the number of unspent-outputs. Now they have lots of money economically locked, i.e. the balance held in each UTXO is small compared to the fees that have to be payed to get them out. The situation gets worse the higher the price of BTC goes.
In a sense what happened to Coinbase is what the bitcoin-protocol is designed to do to tx-spammers: making spamming very expensive over time.
If I were the CEO of Coinbase, I'd just bite the bullet, make one giant transaction of all the UTXOs into a SegWit address and pay a miner directly to mine that abomination of a transaction, paying him in cash $5 million or so.

In the future, with another TB or so in additional blocks, it still should be possible to validate the blockchain front to back by a normal PC.


If you ask me, I think in the future bitcoin will be what gold was under the gold standard. A store of value you deposit in a bank and that bank issues currency to transact that gold. Some bitcoiners have a bank-phobia, but in reality there's nothing wrong with banks. The problem is simply fractional reserve banking and fiat-money, both are gone within the bitcoin system, banks or no banks.
So just as it's unpractical and too expensive to transport physical gold around in armored vans, decades down the road, maybe, transacting directly on the blockchain would be a thought just as outlandish.
But who knows what technological and mathematical breakthroughs await us.
I'm just saying, perfect is the enemy of good and a 100% reserve currency transacting a limited supply money is *very* good.

I think that is a possibility. Even if the miners don't collude, and we stick with the 5 mining pools example, spamming low-fee transactions might still be profitable. The point of equilibrium is shifted, because you lose the spam-fees 4/5s of the time, but the net profit might still be positive, if that means the fees are &gt; 5x larger than they would be under normal user demand.
Be that as it may, other than going off-chain, I don't see how to escape this.
Hopefully in the future, mining hardware will be ubiquitous, or at least much more accessible, so the chance of a miner getting back his spam-fees gets lower and lower, shifting the point of equilibrium between increased fee and spam-fee loss much more towards not wanting to waste too much in spam-fee loss.

Once a channel is open, you only have to create an on-chain transaction when closing a channel.
And there are surprisingly few reasons why you ever would want to close a channel. Even refunding a channel can be done on the fly. 
What's also most probably going to be a common modus operandi, is whenever you make an on-chain transaction anyway, for example when buying something rather expensive, the change-amount or a subset of it funds a new LN channel.
There are all kinds of tricks how to batch a bunch of on-chain-demanding stuff into one transaction.

Alright, let's put on that tin-foil hat.
Goldman knows, that the SEC decision for rejecting previous ETF applications, like the Winkelvoss ETF, was partly due to "possible market manipulation".
One could argue, that this back and forth of Goldmans "crypto-trading-desk" was the reason for the recent dip. I personally doubt it, but it might be.
One also could assume that this could be seen as manipulation by Goldman. Their lawyers will argue that it's not their fault, it was fake-news, whatever. This isn't about legality.
If all this is true, then one conclusion is, that Goldman wants the decision of the VanEck-ETF delayed further (latest date of a decision is late Feb. 2019, iirc).
Do they want their friends to have a little more time to onboard on BTC?
Are they planning on having their own ETF?

You have to kill even more laws, not just NN. It's almost everywhere illegal for competitors to enter the market of ISPs. I've seen a report of a village that dug their own land-lines because the big ISPs didn't extend their service to their small village. It worked perfectly, nobody complained, then the ISPs sued them for not having the license to lay down cables. If you want to be secure against monopoly behavior, strengthen the free market instead of begging the government to regulate the monopoly *they* created with their regulation. You are literally going to the Mafia henchmen who broke your legs begging them to give you crutches.

To my knowledge, he didn't anticipate mining-pools. When every user, or most users at least, are miners, the chance of you getting your spam-fees back are 1 in thousand or less and so it's not worth it.
Currently I'm writing on an article thinking the situation through from an Austrian School perspective. Spoiler alert: My hunch is, that relatively high fees are inevitable and paradoxically good, because they explicitly measure in money-prices the cost of decentralization, which otherwise would be hidden in uneconomic mining. Or put differently: due to comparative advantage between different mining locations (some having cheaper energy, lower ambient temperature, more reliant electricity, more high skilled laborers available, etc.), you either are mining at a high cost (profit can still be positive, but you have a high opportunity cost), or you stop mining and shift the equilibrium towards higher transaction fees due to miner-spam. Either case, you are paying roughly the same price per transaction, either in a roundabout way of inefficiently mining them yourself, or by paying above spam-fee.
Turns out, bitcoin is a defense mechanism against economic censorship and like every other defense, it comes with a price. Nobody can change that. Better and smarter technology can simply bring that price down. LN would be an example of such smarter technology.

No matter what you decide on, make sure you are using SegWit-adresses. The format starting with `3...` is more compatible right now. The new bech32-address format isn't wide spread right now.
And if you choose a wallet that's secured by a seed:  Write the recovery seed on paper and store it securely with your other important documents.
PS: I just looked into Exodus to see which type of seed they are using, so you might be able to import it into a better wallet and this is what I get: 
Allowing the user to make a wallet backup only *after* money got sent to the wallet is a huge security flaw and completely artificial. There is no reason whatsoever for this practice. It only means, that in the time frame between your money being sent and you making the backup, your funds are unsecured. Unbelievable.

Recommendet reading on this topic: 
Jörg Guido Hülsmann - The Ethics of Money Production (free from the Mises Institute): 
There are a lot of economic arguments why fiat money production isn't as harmless you make it out to be.
First and foremost, is that the possibility of an infinite supply of base money from the central bank, allows commercial banks to go into low-reserve fractional reserve banking. That's the actual money supply increase that's really bad for the economy, as it initiates the business cycle. (see Austrian Business Cycle Theory)
Aside from that, one insight I had from reading Hülsmanns book, was the immediate and inherent moral hazard the mere *possibility* of arbitrary money supply increase has. If there is one party who can print money, the attitude of everyone towards that party changes dramatically. Your whole being changes, who you're friends with, who you do business with etc. This party doesn't even have to actually produce extra money and devalue it, but the simple fact that it *could* do so, introduces moral hazard.

For cold storage, I think Electrum is the best: 


Other than the automatic impossibility of keeping the seed permanently offline:
Because you should test the backup before sending anything to that wallet. That means, create the wallet. Backup the seed. Write down an address from the wallet. Delete the wallet. Reconstruct from the seed. Check if the same address is generated. Send a small test-amount to the wallet AND send the small test-amount out of the wallet again. If all that worked, you can be reasonably sure that your backup actually does reconstruct your wallet.
Also: what if your machine breaks right between you sending the first funds and not having a seed backup yet?
The engineering choices that the Exodus dev's made are just fucking dumb and I wouldn't trust that wallet with any amount of money.
PS: you've got to get cold storage. If the Electrum way is too complicated, buy a Trezor from trezor.io.

Yes. That's it. Every additional transaction they include increases the probability of picking one that's actually invalid and will be rejected by the network, while giving them only a tiny amount of money.
This incentive structure makes it even more absurd to have large blocks ala BCH. If for nothing else, this gives you an equilibrium function of how many transactions you're going to include in the next block. And apparently, even 1MB (effectively almost 4 if everything was native segwit) is still too large at the moment, as evidenced by sub-1MB block during sup-1MB mem-pool.

Because everybody who offers gold backed banking services, gets his doors kicked in by the CIA on trumped up charges. See [E-Gold]( That's the reason, why decentralization is the most important attribute in Bitcoin and must never be jeopardized by hasty protocol changes. 
The only company that offers a service comparable to a fully gold backed bank is GoldMoney.com and I don't know how long that will last, or how fast they freeze your account, to demonstrate to the powers that be, that they are doing everything they can to play by the rules.
That's really it. Regulation. People have to accept fiat and using anything but fiat is very cumbersome if not illegal. If left to its own devices, the market always chooses the hardest money, historically gold, but now bitcoin. And the trick with bitcoin is, that it doesn't really care about regulation. The network just chugs along.


Maybe we can compare it with dollarization? Outside of, lets say the Euro-zone, what percentage of the world population stores their value in dollar as opposed to their (even worse) local fiat currency? Maybe that could be a proxy data point to make some sort of prediction if world-wide bitcoin dominance means 99% in bitcoin or "only" like 80%. My gut feeling tends towards the 99% scenario, simply because bitcoin can't be kept out of a country easily, if at all.

Of course I don't use gold as a medium of exchange, only as a store of value. But that's not because gold is bad at being a medium of exchange, that's because I'm forced to use government money.
If I weren't forced to use Euros, I most probably would use bank notes, physical or digital, which are certificates for a fixed amount of gold, which makes the daily use non distinguishable from how you use fiat money today (which was historically backed by gold and silver. The Euro of course, was never backed).

Who the fuck elected you as a spokesperson? The reason why you've got your panties in a bunch about this, is because the Core code is the most widely used, voluntarily, and that has one reason: it's the best. Can the best have errors? Of course. But probably still the fewest.

A miner could use the same inputs to a transaction twice, thus creating additional coins out of nothing. Without the bug, nodes reject such a block, as it would be an attempt of double-spending. The bug was, that a node was blind to this particular way of double-spending and would have accepted it. Notice, that this would have to be done deliberately by a miner and the invalid block would not have been accepted by every node on the network, as not every node has this bug. The miner would thus risk losing 12.5 BTC block reward and the energy put into mining this invalid block. No miner attempted this, because thankfully the bitcoin protocol has a few game-theoretical fail-safes built in, such as this.


Yes, very likely, which is why some of them are very pissed. Copy-pasting the Core code and making some trivial changes is one thing, maintaining the code base, finding and correcting bugs is another. There are probably many more bugs yet to be discovered and corrected, such is the nature of large software code-bases. It's hard enough for world class programmers immersed into the code for years. It's impossible for the average shitcoin-dev, I would assume. Another reason to just ignore all shitcoins altogether.

He once did a video about how Proof-of-Stake is BS and the reasons he gave are to my understanding correct.
I was wondering, if there's another problem with PoS: In a PoW network, if miners go offline, the hashrate drops, we have a little longer block times for a while, difficulty adjusts downwards and everything ticks along nicely. The network sort of forgets that he has ever been there.
Would the PoS-equivalent of "a miner going offline" be a staker losing his private key?
What if someone with for example 20% of the stake loses his keys? Is he still going to win every 5th decision on the next block, but can't do anything, except maybe approve the defaults? It seems to me like a giant mining pool that can't be turned off or even adjusted (softforks, signaling of something, etc.) any longer and just votes forever the protocol as it has been when the key was lost.

Because this "we must spend bitcoin to do X" comes up so often, I just made this little page:
Edit: Also, most people who receive your bitcoin payment instantly cash out for fiat. So you *are* selling your bitcoin for fiat, only in a very complicated way.

You have to see the whole picture.
Bitcoin will replace fiat paper money. If you want to focus on the environment, look at that damage.
For example: A permanent warfare state like the US has a navy that consumes as much power as Greece. And such state action can *only* be funded through inflation. Historically, it was never possible to engage in prolonged, total wars, without inflating the money supply.
Or take Argentina. People there buy cars to escape inflation. We all know that cars are terrible store of value, but they are better than the Argentinian Peso. Can you imagine the destructive force on the environment of people buying cars not because they need them for productive transportation, but to escape inflation? All the raw materials, energy for production, etc.
And globally, consumerism. All the plastic junk we buy. Every year a new smartphone with *massive* amounts of highly problematic chemicals, both in the end product and during production. This obsession with immediate satisfaction, from factory farmed food on to the crap that is called music today. All is driven by cheap money, debt, credit which all has one root: fiat paper money.

First I would install Mycelium on Android or BRD wallet on iOS and then write the seed down on paper. This is going to be your new wallet for the time being.
Download [Tails]( create a bootable USB thumb drive or DVD and boot from it without an Internet connection, i.e. unplug your network cable or simply don't connect to wifi.
From within the offline running Tails installation, start Electrum and create a new wallet, but chose the "I already have a seed" option.
Check the "BIP39" box under "Options" when typing in the seed.
Choose the correct derivation path. If you used legacy addresses, the ones starting with 1, choose that. If you used compatible SegWit-addresses (starting with 3) choose p2sh-segwit.
Install Electrum on another computer, this time with Internet connection. You can also install it on an Android phone or tablet.
On this online electrum, import the extended public key which you get from the offline version under "Wallet" -&gt; "Information". You can scan its QR code or copy and paste it to another USB thumb drive.
Within the online installation of electrum, you should now see the balance. If not, then don't panic. It only means Trezor and Electrum use different derivation paths.
When you have all of that, you can test send a small amount to your Mycelium/BRD-wallet.
Here's a video tutorial on how to use electrum as cold storage. The only difference for you is, that you already have the seed:
I hope that helps. Unfortunately, I won't be available for a few hours now, but I hope everything works out for you.
PS: Don't just buy a new Trezor and restore to it. You lost your old Trezor and you don't know what the finder might be able to do with it. I would get a new Trezor but use a new seed and send everything over to the new Trezor.

Yes, it really is a limitation on the physical universe. With the current block size, you have approx. 10 tx/s. Now what if you increase that 100-fold to a 100 MB block size? Now you really are at a physical barrier for catching up with the blockchain and validation of the blocks. And you bumped the throughput to 1000 tx/s, which is still nothing. It's a drop in the ocean.
But this discussion is as old as bitcoin and the cool thing is, if you think that increasing the blocksize is the way to go, you have that. And I'm not talking about btrash right now. Litecoin and Dogecoin have actually a higher transaction volume than that piece of shit scamcoin.

The words "high" and "low" only have meaning when you compare it to something of the same sort. Is Mount Everest high? Yes, compared to a church, no compared to Olympus Mons.
So is the speculative demand, or the transactual demand, or whatever else demand, high? Compared to what? 12 months ago? Maybe, how would you measure it? You could compare trading volume over exchanges, but we know they also do wash trades and we don't know anything about OTC trades or black/grey market trades.
As I said before, there is no way to define "high" or "low" in absolute terms and it is very difficult to quantify the different demands and compare them over time.
Same goes for supply.
BUT: when the price goes down, then there's only one reason: supply exceeds demand. It doesn't matter if the demand is high, if the supply exceeds it, the price will still go down, and vice-versa.

It is not just another ideology, just like 2+2=4 is not another ideology. Any social theory that violates the non aggression principle and property is inherently illogical and doomed to fail. This is why nobody was being shot trying to break *into* east Germany, but many were shot trying to flee that socialist "workers paradise".
Your objection is very common. The objection, that service X is currently provided by the government, so if you get rid of government, service X will stop being provided. Of course, the latter doesn't follow the former. Protection of life and property is just a service, there is nothing special about it. If BP trespasses on my property to drill for oil, the protection agency of which I'm a customer of, will do its job and stop that.
I never said that in this scenario it is impossible for BP to drill for oil in the Gulf of Mexico, I was simply asking what would be asked of them, if they wanted to do it on your property.
The answer is different from person to person, of course. I can give you mine: If they compensate me for my inconvenience and risk, I would let them drill on my property. Since I'm planning on maximizing the value of my property, I'm not interested in getting the maximum profit from it for the next 4 years, but for the next 40, or 400 if you count my offspring who will inherit it. So the risk-reward calculation is substantially shifted towards the property owner, minimizing my risk, but also making the potential reward for BP smaller.
If you do away with the non aggression principle, which means you allow for government, and weaken private property, you'll end up with a situation like we had: The risk is shifted entirely on the population, the reward is shifted entirely to BP, minus the "sponsoring" and "lobbying" money for the politicians of course, which is negligible compared to the profit.
Another example: Banks. You tell me what happens, if you make an economic environment in which you can cash out all the profits of high risk investments, but get bail out money if the investments don't pay off. If course you get one banking crisis after another, one bail out after another, one quantitative easing after another.
But we couldn't do away with government... Who would regulate the money supply and the banks, right? And yet, here we are, in a subreddit that makes government unnecessary in regards to finance. There's no reason to stop here.

I would do something you can carry in your head, if all else fails. An Electrum seed, a random list of 12 words, can be memorized and it provides you infinite addresses and keys. 
* 1: Install [Electrum]( on an offline computer and do everything below on this offline computer. It's okay to go online for a short amount of time to install Electrum, but at least be behind a router or maybe even a firewall. Here are three videos explaining the steps: [One]( [Two]( [Three](
* 2: Write down the 12 word seed on a piece of paper
* 2a: Encrypt the wallet on that offline computer with [a strong password](
* 3: Save a few addresses (not private keys) on a USB stick
* 4: Create a m-of-n SSSS-split with previously saved  like a 2-of-3 split
* 5: Print out the codes of the 3 splits. I would also install additionally to Electrum in step 1 the program QtQr which can read and create QR-codes. This way you can copy and paste the split-codes into a Writer document and also add QR-codes, which makes it much easier to reconstruct, if you need to, meaning, if you forget the 12 word seed.
* 6: Remember the 12 word seed. Make it something like a prayer in hour head you tell yourself every day 3 times
* 7: Once you are confident, that you remembered the 12 words, destroy the single piece of paper with the seed on it
* 8: Place the splits in trustworthy places. For example, one for your mother, one to the friend you mentioned, one to your lawyer.
* 9: Send all the bitcoins to the addresses you saved in step 3
* 10: Make the hard drive of the offline computer inaccessible, for example buy wiping it with 
I recommend for step 1 to do the following:
* 1: create an Ubuntu [DVD]( or [USB-stick](
* 2: install it encrypted and use [a strong password]( as the passphrase, which you write down on a piece of paper
* 3: do all the steps of above
* 4: destroy the piece of paper with the hard drive passphrase, no wiping will be needed, since your data is encrypted with a practically unbreakable passphrase AND the wallet (containing the seed) is encrypted with an unbreakable passphrase too.
If you need help with any of those steps, feel free to PM me.

Inflation is the increase in the quantity of money. This doesn't mean, that prices in absolute terms rise. For example, if the population expects the increase in money supply to be temporary, they'll start hoarding money in the expectation that the previous level will be achieved, which in real terms causes an actual *deflationary* pressure, i.e. consumer prices fall. But only for a short time. People then realize the inflation doesn't stop and start spending the money sooner than they would, if the purchasing power simply increased according to natural market supply and demand.
Most economists and commentators are very sloppy with the words and they implicitly equate inflation with general increase in consumer prices, and deflation with general decrease in consumer prices.
Reality is a little more nuanced.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:14:17
How would one hold down prices by trading (cash-settled) futures?
Edit: I'm asking, because gas prices are increasing over here. And since crude oil futures exist, maybe someone could trade it down a little so I can save some money and don't have to ride my old bike to work.
PS: I'm very skeptical that this "futures can suppress the price"-theory holds water, because it would be literally like creating stuff out of thin air, like in the crude oil example.

So don't read to much into BS headlines ala "ZOMG! THE ETF HAS BEEN REJECTED!". That's literally nonsense.
Having said that, it probably doesn't matter. The last "ETF that got rejected" was exactly this case: the Winkelvoss application from last year got delayed, they objected, it got delayed again. Still, all the "news" sites screamed "ETF REJECTED!"... no... that's literally snow from last year, bureaucracy just works really really slowly.

No. But if you want to be super-secure, you can combine different random number generators. You can do something like this when using bitaddress.org:
* Copy the newly generated private key into the "Brain Wallet" tab. This makes use of the bitaddress.org random function
* Type in random characters. Just slam on the keyboard like a monkey
* User your operating systems RNG. The /dev/random device on Linux puts out real random numbers, base64 encodes them into characters that can be copied into the bitaddress text box
* Roll dice. Every 99 digit base6 number is a bitcoin private key
* Flip a coin 160 times, or 160 coins one time.
* draw a picture in some graphics software, the more chaotic the better and sha256sum it
The more sources of entropy you use, the more you are secured against one not being as random as you might have hoped.
I for one trust bitaddress.orgs default random function and the RNG in Linux.

There's nothing wrong with banking per se. Banks, as an intermediary between savers (lenders) and borrowers serve a very important role in the economy. They provide a mechanism to find the market rate of interest and thus arbitrage between present money and future money. (i.e. how much do I have to pay you in a year, so you abstain from consumption of what that money could buy you in that year.)
The problem lies with central banks and FRB causing business cycles (see Austrian Business Cycle Theory).
If banks use sound money, like gold or bitcoin, and abstain from FRB, we're all good.

Viewed from Bitcoin's point of view, fiat currencies, even the relativley stable ones like the USD, have been in very strong inflation. Not quite hyperinflation, yet.

Mostly, but not always. Fractional reserve banking occurred and occurs in the private sector too. One of the latest examples is MTGOX. The difference between a private bank/money handler and a government bank doing fractional reserve, is that the private institutions actually go out of business, which is good, while the governments just indept their citizens ever more, until not only a single player fails, but the whole system comes down.
But you are correct, every other "we" is of course spoken exclusively from the perspective of the government, so not you and I, but them.

The first thing your friend has to understand is, that blockchains suck. They are a horrible datatype. Slow, unwieldy, huge in size. Proof of Work (PoW) sucks too. It's intentionally resource intensive to make it economically infeasible to attack the blockchain.
That being said, if you want a sovereign money, i.e. a money that can't be seized, censored, inflated,... you have no other choice than to use a blockchain+PoW. The reason is, that the control of money is a very powerful thing to have. Every state on the planet wants that control.
So every solution to the sovereignty of money problem must not have a central point of attack. Like a firm, a leader, some central figure, because *that* is where states would put pressure on and then we're back at square one.
Only bitcoin qualifies in this regard, simply because it was the first and the control over the network was dispersed over the whole planet. In its nature, bitcoin thus resembles something like a natural material, like gold.
Everything that came after (like Ethereum, Peercoin, Feathercoin,...) was created in order to give its creator an advantage over later stage adopters. It resembles something like golden Chuck E Cheese tokens. It looks somewhat similar to gold, but couldn't be more different in its inherent characteristics.

The basics:
* An address is derived from a private key. A private key always derives the same address. You can't derive the private key from the address.
* You don't actually transfer bitcoins. You sign transactions that are maintained on a public ledger. The signing is done with the private key. The network checks if the signing was correct by checking if the address you signed bitcoins away from matches the signature.
* Controlling the private key is controlling the bitcoins
If you want to give someone bitcoins, the preferred way is to have that person install a wallet on a secure device, make a backup of the wallet and send the bitcoins to one of his addresses.
If I were you, I'd install Mycelium on my Android smartphone or Breadwallet on my iPhone and transfer the bitcoins from the online wallet to my smartphone wallet. Of course, only after backing up the smartphone wallet. In both cases writing down a 12 word seed on a piece of paper and securely storing it is enough to be secure. Then have your dad install one of those apps too and just send him some coins. Maybe your mom too, so he can test sending also.

I think the concept of a multi-sig setup, using permanently offline systems and paper-only backups is great.
However, I'd change the protocol to use Electrum instead.
Setting up multi-sig arrangements with Electrum is really simple, spending form these multi-sig addresses is also very simple and writing down mnemonic seeds consisting of 12 English words is much less error prone than writing down an actual private key.

I found that it makes a huge difference if, when generating the QR-code, there was a line ending symbol appended to the end of the private key.
The first command sends the private key to the *correct horse battery staple*-brainwallet to qrencode *with* a line ending symbol, the second one *without*:
`$ echo '5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS' | qrencode -s 10 -l M -o with-line-ending.png`
`$ echo -n '5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS' | qrencode -s 10 -l M -o without-line-ending.png`
Try it for yourself. With the android wallet app, only the one without a line ending symbol is scanned properly:

Please don't use USB thumb drives or any other flash based memory for long term storage of data. Digitally storing data for extended periods of time is still a non-trivial task, even for experienced IT experts.
Paper on the other hand... that's easy. I'm sure you still have your birth certificate laying around in some desk drawer, with no problem getting the information it holds from it. And you didn't even think about securely storing it.
If you want to stealth your bitcoin key, you have to understand, how that works. Just to be clear:
* 1) You send bitcoins to a bitcoin address.
* 2) That bitcoin address is derived from a so called *public key*
* 3) That public key is derived from a so called *private key*
* 4) You can not calculate the private key from the address or the public key.
* 5) The private key is any output of a sha256 hash function, basically any 256-bit number
What does that mean? If you want to go stealth, you can just create a really strong passphrase (case sensitive alpha numeric with 45 truly random characters), write that down, put it to your other important documents, before putting it somewhere save, derive a private key (and an address) from it. For example by writing it into the "brain wallet" tab of bitaddress.org.
For example:
* 1) I just created the passphrase **wzS2NaPkn8kSHLd2KfFP6MsCpeHDSSzkSxkSp6TmJ6SiW**. It's 45 characters long and the alphabet used is base58. So it's strength is approximately 256 bits of entropy.
* 2) I now print it out.
* 3) Now I go to bitaddress.org, choose "brain wallet" and copy that passphrase into to text field. Then I click "view". This generates the corresponding private key 5JLcfjmDsRfFcsRexJqisWCiSBbSdNu4okJZv1FcLq8XjEyKCPP with the address 1KpCxiUkPVwZQEbid2ncwuZEv9qeTahgtx.
* 4) I send my funds to the address.
* 5) Now I put that piece of paper between my birth certificate and some other rather boring piece of paper.
If you really want to stay digital, you can simply use a passphrase as strong as the one above and create a small (like 10 MB) truecrypt container with it. Put the files in it and copy the truecrypt container to a USB thumb drive, your Gmail-account and dropbox. The passphrase, of course, still has to go to your important documents.
I'd prefer the first method though. You can even append -1, -2, -3 and so on for many different address/key-pairs. Like wzS2NaPkn8kSHLd2KfFP6MsCpeHDSSzkSxkSp6TmJ6SiW-1, wzS2NaPkn8kSHLd2KfFP6MsCpeHDSSzkSxkSp6TmJ6SiW-2, wzS2NaPkn8kSHLd2KfFP6MsCpeHDSSzkSxkSp6TmJ6SiW-3,...

The price of mining is supposed to approximate the price of the mining reward. The difficulty adjusts accordingly, up and down. If for whatever reason mining becomes unprofitable for miners on the margin, they simply stop (if they don't want to mine at a loss). The decreased hash-rate then leads to the difficulty adjusting downwards. Miners on the margin re-enter the mining-market, hash-rate goes up, profitability decreases and so on.
Worst case scenario is very slow blocks and relatively high transaction fees in the meantime. Nothing that impedes the operability and integrity of the bitcoin network in the slightest. In fact, I for one welcome a higher block time (or smaller blocks) from time to time. It's sort of an investment into the future viability of the blockchain, by keeping the size as small as possible. But I digress.

This is apples and oranges. You don't pay money with credit card, you just pledge to owe it. Sooner or later you'll have to pay that dept, so sooner or later you have to have some sort of service that sends actual money. You would have to compere the convenience of that service to what I'm doing here.
Starting a computer and doing an offline-signed transaction every few days is not inconvenient to me. It certainly is less inconvenient that using an ATM, to which I have to go, maybe wait if some asshole infront of me figures out how it works, ...
If it were inconvenient to have that offline-setup and I had these payments every few days, I probably would have an extra wallet setup. Something in between the cold storage and the smartphone. Probably on my online computer, or a tablet, which is online, but doesn't leave the house, so it can be stolen, but at least, it can't be lost.

 Having the wallet encrypted with a strong password and having multiple backups, hopefully also at independent places is a really good security measure. 
A possible attack would be malware recording your keystrokes to find out the password of the wallet file when you type it in.
 Yes, you understood that correctly. [Here]( you can see the creation of a private key and the derivation of the public key and the address from it step by step. A more usable version to create keys and addresses for real world usage can be found at [bitaddress.org](
 To unlock the wallet, type in the console window
`walletpassphrase "your_passphrase" 300`
This unlocks the wallet for 300 seconds. Then type 
`dumpwallet /home/your_username/my_wallet.txt`
if you are on Linux, change the path accordingly for Windows. I would do that on an offline machine, tough, because it saves your wallet in plaintext.
One thing that has to be worked into your backup strategy with bitcoin-qt is, that there is a pool of 100 addresses and keys in the wallet. If this pool runs out, new keys/addresses are created and those won't be in your backups, of course.
This is the reason why I recommend using a deterministic wallet, like Electrum. In it, you start from 128-bits of entropy/randomness and every key and address is derived from that 128 initial bits. They are called the seed and are all that has to backed up. And the way to back them up, is writing down a 12 word list, that's it.
So, my recommendation, if you are doing a backup routine now, make a new one: Create an offline installation of Electrum and back up that seed, really just 12 english words. Google "cold wallet setup electrum" and I'm sure you'll find many how tos.
@_date: 2014-04-20 18:35:07
Well, then, the strategy seems to be clear :)
I just hope you don't over-estimate the strength of your passwords... I wouldn't go lower than 128 bits of entropy. What I found to be fairly easy to remember are Electrum seeds.

That's what I meant. In your calculation right there, you've estimated 12.9 bits of entropy per word. How accurate is that? Where does that number come from? I believe it comes from linguists, but I'm not sure. And I don't doubt it's vastly incorrect.
But my super-paranoia says, what if? So I'd rather start from a 128-bit random number from a well tested, often used random number generator, my linux box, and then convert that into a corresponding word set, instead the other way around: choose words from a word set and add words until the estimated randomness reaches 128 bits or more.

If the cost of billing electricity by the kWh is smaller than just flat rating it, then the landlord will do so. This is not an unwitting entity. He's making a calculation and the parameters changed. He'll adjust and he'll be fine.


Every scarce resource has a price. Since you and I can't own the same apple at the same time, it's the property of whoever yielded it first. Let's say it's me. Now you may want to buy that apple from me, for 1 dollar. Are you an unwitting fool? What did I invest? Just one hand motion. Is that worth a dollar? It is for you, if you decide to buy from me. That doesn't make you a fool.
Now suppose, that suddenly, the number of people who desire apples increases 1000 fold in just a few years. Apples don't grow any faster, just because more people want them. And new apple trees take time to grow too. Now what will happen? Of course the price increases. Are you now a fool to buy an apple for 1000 dollars? Who am I to judge, and by the way, who the fuck are you to judge? If you want that apple, and supply and demand make it worth 1000 dollars, and you can afford it, go for it! Mind you... the work to pick an apple is still the same. Only the demand increased, which drove the price up.
The same is true for bitcoin. Don't try to guess why people pay dollars for bitcoins. Maybe they believe the demand and therefore the price will increase again. That's what you are assuming every bitcoin buyer does. And so what if that's true? If you are so sure that this is not going to happen, then don't buy bitcoins, or even better, speculate on the fact, that they will go down in price.
But one thing is for sure: it is not, in any shape or form, fraud or fleecing a fool to speculate on the future increase of demand for bitcoins, or making profit from a past investment, even if it's only a few CPU cycles, because of the recent increase of demand.

Unlicensed selling of bitcoins, or gold, or whatever is probably a crime comparable to unlicensed picking up strangers with a car and taking them to where you were going anyway. That seems to be also very dangerous in France: 
You know... the problem really is, that in societies as socialistic as the french, too many people depend on the government for their income. Without all the favors and special treatments like licensing and so on, they are just not able to compete in an honest way.

The connection is, that inflating the money supply, which increases the national debt, because usually the central banks buy government bonds, and spending the new money is the only trick the government knows in this pony show. With diminishing effects of monetary stimulus, they'll be tempted to increase inflation further and further. Secondary effects, like people going out of the USD and into other currencies or assets can then easily trigger a hyperinflation, even if the original inflation was somewhat controlled. If it happens, it happens quickly and if you weren't prepared before, you won't ever be.

What I like about bitcoin.de is, that they only hold your bitcoin balance that is traded. The cash is sent from user to user. If you buy bitcoins, you get the bank information of the seller, you send the money, you click *sent* and after the seller confirms the money arrived, bitcoin.de releases the funds. Since I'm not planning on selling in the near future, I immediately withdraw the bitcoins to my own wallet and that's it. 100% walk away safe.

Bitcoin is strangely the first and only monetary system, in which the inflation by creating new money is not a zero-sum game. Even with gold the new gold doesn't add anything to the current capital structure, but simply transfers purchasing power from late to early receivers. But at least the supply of gold is very inelastic. 
But with bitcoin, the process of creating new bitcoins, i.e. mining, is actually a net *positive* for the rest of bitcoin holders. As a bitcoin holder, the inflation actually buys you something, namely increased security of the network.

Imagine bitcoin matures, say in the next 5 to 10 years, there's a solid infrastructure built around it, making it easy to go in and out of fiat, paying at many physical shops, restaurants etc.
And due to bitcoins controlled inflation, the development of it's value is constantly going up, because more wealth is going into the bitcoin economy or is created inside it, compared to people cashing out on top of regular inflation due to the algorithm.
Do you think "regular" people will have an incentive to earn/buy/hold bitcoin, because they see the price of goods and services compared to the local fiat currency rising, while they stay the same or even decline compared to bitcoin?
Or will such a scenario put pressure on governments and central banks to cut back on the creation of new money, kind of nullifying that advantage of bitcoin over fiat?
Or is this never going to happen, because there will be enough customers of banks who lend on a fractional base of bitcoin, thus creating additional units of BTC-IOUs compensating the deflationary-like characteristics of bitcoin?
Or something completely different?

Corporations don't exist. Only people exist. So if you put a tax on the profits of a corporation, employees and customers of that corporation will have to pay these taxes.
It's like making BP pay a fine for an oil spill. BP doesn't exist. Who ends up paying that fine are the shareholders and customers who now have to pay more per gallon of gas to compensate for the fine.
The goal can only be to hold the people working in a corporation as responsible as anybody else would be held responsible. And to tax a corporation just like you tax a person, which, of course, should be zero, because taxes are extortion money.

Are they legally forbidden to announce this as the reason for the delay?
Because, if it really is the case that the godawful fascists banking regulations are the reason for the delay, they should make that clear. Most customers, who almost by definition hate (banking) regulation, would be on their side.
They must know that, I don't think there is a law forbidding them to give proper information, so I think they simply screwed up.

Hive uses the same HD branches as breadwallet, right? Mycelium uses a different one, meaning the same seed produces different keys in Hive/breadwallet and Mycelium.

It is very hard to prove reserves when using gold. Historically, only 90% of the transacted currency was backed by gold. With bitcoin, you can always and instantly prove reserves, simply by creating a digital signature. 
And with 2nd layer solutions like LN, that isn't even needed, because you never expose yourself to counter-party risk in the first place.

Interesting. I'll look into it. But refuting something that can be logically proven through Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics is going to be hard.
Edit: I just looked into the graph you posted. I'll definitely bookmark that site, but it kind of fits to what I wrote earlier. This is all official trading volume, there's no way to measure OTC and black/grey markets. And if you look further into the past, the most volume came from BTCChina, Huobi and Okcoin, who I highly suspect to be engaged in *massive* wash trading.
I'm not saying the demand is high or low, I'm just saying that it's very hard to measure, if it's even possible. All that can be said the relative size of supply and demand.

I see your point with lending. For "regular" bank deposits, banking is useless tough. I just want the money I earn sent to my bank account and I want to withdraw cash whenever I want. Right now, all money I deposit in a bank, is subject to lending. For that risk, I am compensated with 0.25% interest on my deposit. As you say, a bank is not a lockbox service. But for my regular every day living needs, I want a lockbox service.
If I want my money to be involved in lending, like you described in that last paragraph of yours, this should be a conscious decision. If I want to be part of an international, or national for that matter, banking infrastructure, I have to give up the ownership to my money and trust it to a bank, which in turn, lends it. I'm not denying that lending won't be a part when we have a bitcoin  centric economy, of course it will and why shouldn't it? But in a bitcoin economy, I have the choice to participate, or not.

On Android: Electrum. If you chose "segwit" when setting it up, you'll get bech32-addresses (starting with `bc1...`), which are native-segwit but unforunatley still not 100% supported by all wallets and exchanges.
You can create a BIP39 seed on  (can be done offline) and then import the master private key to generate P2SH-segwit addresses (starting with a 3). Just scroll down and scan the master private key starting with `yprv...`.

What does "high" mean? High compared to what?
If the price goes down, the supply exceeds the demand. That's all that can be said.

@_date: 2018-05-22 15:44:49


No, absolutely not. What you can infer from the last 4 months is, that supply exceeds demand, but not that demand is low. It is *lower* than supply, but saying it is flat out low makes no sense. Again, low compared to what? *Lower* than supply, obviously, that's reflected by the price decrease. Low compared to 12 months ago? Probably not. The demand is probably a lot higher than 12 months ago.


Again no. If your savings and investment strategy is dependent upon a constant price increase of whatever you bought, you're an idiot. That's not how the world works. 
I recommend the book [Austrian School for Investors]( (also available in German). The Authors differentiate between 4 strategies that you can (and according to them should) employ:
* Investing, i.e. bonds
* Speculation, i.e. stocks
* Cash, i.e. USD, EUR, CHF, physical and deposit accounts
* Hoarding, i.e. gold
For them bitcoin is part of Speculation, for me it's the ultimate hoarding asset. I also hoard gold, but not as zealously as bitcoin.
Hoarding, what we call hodling, is not speculation. If anything, you *increase* your hoarding asset (gold, btc) during a bear market.
But it's okay to view it as a speculative asset. That's your choice, but that's hard. Most people lose money trying to buy low and sell high.
If you read the book, PM me when you come to the pyramid of hoarding assets and tell me if you had the same epiphany as I did, regarding where bitcoin has to be placed.
@_date: 2018-05-07 10:47:01
Apples to apples, bitcoin has always been faster and cheaper than fiat.
Because an apples to apples comparison means, you have a custodial wallet that transfers bitcoin via internal database transactions or external trusted transactions that get settled independently from the actual sending/receiving.

Never delete any wallet or single key you had in use, ever. Put it into your regular backup, maybe an external hard drive, maybe encrypted uploading into the cloud, but don't delete. Sure, delete the blockchain data if you have to, but don't delete the wallet.dat file.
I recommend creating a Truecrypt volume of like 100 MB and just putting the stuff in there. That old wallet.dat, PDFs or JPEGs of the (non-cold) paper wallets you made, seeds, etc. Use a strong passphrase that you back up securely and just throw that volume on an USB drive and, I don't know, maybe upload to dropbox, if you are really confident in the un-brute-force-ability of your passphrase.

An unemotional, fact based analysis of this incident based on the evidence at hand can be seen here: 
* Michael Brown robbed a store
* Was held up by police, walking in the middle of the road
* Attacked police officer, punching him in the face (iirc) and going for the cops gun
* Police officer has the choice to employ deadly force or risk getting knocked out and being killed while unconscious
* He shoots Michael Brown
Seriously, this is getting ridiculous. I'm sorry that this man was killed and I'm feeling sorry for the family he leaves behind, but if you attack ANYBODY and pose a deadly force and you get shot, then that's your own fault.
And calling Michael Brown "unarmed" to indicate that he didn't pose a threat is deceptive beyond compare. If a 300 lbs guy attacks you, it is reasonable to assume an attack on your life.
This is the same non-story just like the Trevon Martin-story.

I don't think "Company"-Coins are going to be a decentralized proof-of-work based currency. They are just going to be digital tokens managed by one central authority, the company.
And this is model is either obsolete or impossible to pull off and here is why.
If Company X decides to issue X-Coin, how will it be backed? If it is backed by USD, it is obsolete. You are still using fiat currency with all it's downsides like loss of value by the minute. Why would I buy any significant amount worth of USD of X-Coin, when it's purchasing power just decreases like USD would have anyway AND I won't be able to spend X-Coin at Company Y? That's just another form of voucher and they are actually a stupid concept targeting people who can't come up with gift ideas for friends and relatives (like me!).
And what if Company X decides to back X-Coin with company stock, gold, silver, or even bitcoin? They will get shut down. Even if Company X is Microsoft, Amazon, Google, or Apple or any other rich company. Nobody messes with the big rip off that is fiat currency and central banks and gets away with it. That is why we have bitcoin in the first place. We needed, and now have, a non-fiat backed currency that is impossible to shut down.
Starting another blockchain is simply stupid. You don't gain anything that's significant but are missing out to be protected by the strongest hashing-network on the planet.

There is absolutley a connection between national debt and inflation.
The government painted itself into a corner, by promoting monetary spending as a boost to the economy (which it isn't, look into Austrian Business Cycle Theory).
This tactic became less efficient over time, as you can see here: 
[What you see here is how much of increase in USD-terms of the GDP you got, with one additional dollar of debt. So 1950, one dollar new debt got you 4.61 dollars of increased GDP.]

Yes, I believe so. The bitcoins get spread by trade. The bigger the trade compared to the over all market value of bitcoin, the higher the volatility. Buying a Lamborghini for bitcoins results in a considerable dent in the price of bitcoins, if, for example, the overall market cap of bitcoin is the price of 2 Lamborghinis. But if the overall price is a million Lambos, nobody's going to notice.

My concerns reading your strategy
* 1: Your storage is not cold, since you did item number 3. I doubt that you were infected with malware then and that this is a real concern, but still, it's not cold and if you do it again, you should avoid that.
* 2: You should do it again, and don't mess around with your own weird way of creating a seemingly high entropy seed. You calculated the chance of guessing the seed to be 1 in 694812632643207801316333815075? That's only about 2^99. If you had just used the standard method for seed creation, you'd have 2^128 bits of entropy in the seed. In case anybody doesn't know: 2^100 is twice as strong as 2^99. You are throwing *a lot* of entropy out the window right there. Don't you trust the random number generator in Linux?
* 3: That splitting method in item 5 seems hokey. Again, please don't try to invent something yourself. If you want to split a secret into parts, there's a proven, mathematically sound and unbreakable way to do so: [Shamirs Secret Sharing Scheme](
I recommend the following approach to cold storage with Electrum:
* 1: The GNU/Linux distro [Trisquel]( now includes Electrum in its default DVD image. You could just download and burn it to a DVD.
* 2: Boot Trisquel and start Electrum. Then write down the 12 word seed on a piece of paper
* 3: Save a few addresses (not private keys) on a USB stick
* 4: Create a m-of-n SSSS-split with previously saved  like a 2-of-3 split
* 5: Print out the codes of the 3 splits.
* 6: Remember the 12 word seed. Make it something like a prayer in hour head you tell yourself every day 3 times
* 7: Once you are confident, that you remembered the 12 words, destroy the single piece of paper with the seed on it
* 8: Place the splits in trustworthy places. For example, one for your mother, one to a friend, one to your lawyer.
* 9: Send all the bitcoins to the addresses you saved in step 3
If you need help with any of those steps, feel free to PM me.

If I understand you correctly, you think that at the point where the money units become ever more increasingly valuable because of their scarcity, somehow people are going to switch to another currency because it is "more available"? Also, the fact that a money has any value at all, is due to it being held and used by many people.
So somehow many people hold and use bitcoin, their purchasing power increases consistently due to increased productive capabilities over time and sporadic loss of coins, but people are still going to abandon that widely used, purchasing power holding, secure money for... bartsimpsoncoin, because it's "more available"?

Which is the reason, why the non-aggression principle is necessary. If it is the better choice for someone to behave maliciously, it should be illegal and not an inherent feature of the basic legal framework.
I'm not stupid, and I'm not saying that you are intentionally implying that, but anybody with an IQ of 70 is aware that malicious behavior can be beneficial for some actors. Of course it is to my advantage to steal from you, if:


= I have nothing left to lose


= the unauthorized usage won't be notices


= I don't get caught.
But don't you see, that the stealing itself relies on the imbalance of aggression? Alice steals only because she's expecting Bob to not steal. Of course she tries not to get caught, or maybe she just hates Bob and doesn't even care, but she relies on the NAP, at least to the degree that Bob adheres to it.
If you don't have the NAP and property as the basis for every law, then you make it easier to get away with stealing, murder etc.

The mafia is a predecessor to the state. In many regions organized crime comes very closely to what we identify as government. They build schools, provide protection for local businesses, finance waste disposal and so on. The difference between the mafia/the state and businesses simply is your ability to refuse to do business with them. If you refuse to do business with the mafia, they'll kill you or break your legs or whatever, if you refuse to do business with the state, they'll kill you or throw you in jail or whatever. Really not that much of a difference. The state has one advantage though. Not for you, but for them. A chance in the hierarchy of the mafia usually means the death of someone way up in that hierarchy. If you manage to turn your illegal criminal organization into a legal criminal organization, changes in hierarchy are followed by pensions, not by shootouts.
Also: Can you point me to one example of an organized crime gang, like the mafia, or a drug cartel, etc. that A) does not rely on the prohibition of certain products like drugs and alcohol, where said prohibition is of course enforced by the government and B) does not profit from the fact that citizens are not allowed to defend themselves against the criminal gang because that would violate the governments monopoly on force?
Criminal gangs like drug cartels are only a symptom of the criminal gang called government.

The worst someone holding a lot can do, is sell below market value. Yes, the price goes down because of that, but once it's sold off, it stabilizes and picks up again. After that, the tokens, whatever it is, are in the hands of people who want them more than the person who sold them.

I think the biggest advantage of bitcoin over M-Pesa for many people of African countries, is that bitcoin is not pegged to a national currency. As far as I know, M-Pesa is. In some African countries, this is not so much of a problem, since they have somewhat stable currencies, but others don't. The most prominent example being the Zimbabwean Dollar. The new Zimbabwean Dollar is, I think, backed by USD though.
While I as an European might think, that Bitcoin as a store of value is a strange choice, because of high risk and high volatility, I might think otherwise if I went through 3 hyper-inflation periods already and the next is only a bad government policy away.
The technical problems that have to be overcome are only that, technical problems. Those are easy to deal with. Structural and political problems, that's what's hard to deal with. So if you can substitute one for the other, you are more likely to win.
It's trivial to implement an M-Pesa like service which is backed by bitcoin. Would that be a centralized service? Sure. Is it better than the alternative? Yes!
An economy running on bitcoins transferred via SMS is only the first step. If you think ahead, this could open the gates to a more global economy for very local businesses. If someone produces something in an African country, now he can trade in a world wide currency, with practically zero overhead. This net-gain in productivity props up the economy and rather sooner than later, you'll have smartphones all over the place.

Nice straw-man argument. A false one, too!
Why a straw-man? **--&gt;** I simply challenged the assumption, that "water is the limiting factor in human progress". I never said "water is on the things people need to live probably on place 9 or 10... first is liberty!"
Why is it false? **--&gt;** In absence of clean water, cutting down on liberties will produce clean water? Clearly this is false. If clean water is not available to the amount of peoples needs, of course liberty is the first necessity to acquire it. For example you need the notion of property, to own land and dig a well, with the shovel you own and you need the freedom to do as you please without the threat of violence because you didn't apply for a well-digging-license at the local war-lord/municipality. You can then give it away to people, if you so desire, or trade it for whatever they've got, and so on.

I did some calculation:
* If you bought 1000 USD worth of gold in 1914, you'd get 52.71 ounces
* If you buy 23710 USD worth of gold in 2014, you'd get 19.74 ounces
So even if somehow you could counter the inflation with a high enough interest rate, you (or rather your grand children) would still be 2.6 times better off by just buying gold (and not getting robbed by the government when they banned americans from owning gold).
Plus: The increased productivity buys more stuff per gold unit, which kind of is the point in saving. You don't want to buy a PC now, because it's too expensive. So you defer the purchase into the future where the same PC costs only half of today, or you'll get a PC twice as good for the same amount of money.
So theoretically keeping the PC example: You think, well... I'm not going to buy a PC now, which costs about 1 ounce of gold, or 18.97 USD, I'm going to wait a hundred years. Suddenly, you not only can buy 2.6 times more PCs for the same amount of gold, or the accounted for inflation amount of USD, you also get a 1'000'000 times better PC. Of course the increase in purchasing power relative to a good is almost nowhere as drastic as in the computing sector, but still, overall production increases.
This is, in my opinion, an important factor when you think about stuff like this: The inflation is only *one* aspect of how the money loses purchasing power. The fact that ever less valuable money drives you to earlier consumption robs you today of the better goods you might have bought in the future with that saved money. Missed opportunities due to malinvestment driven by an artificially low price on money due to inflation, loss of capital and time, the fact that I'm typing this and not something valuable instead and so on is a whole world of stolen prosperity on top of that. Then add the endless wars, only possible through inflation, the destruction of capital in wars, to loss of human life, who might have been *the guy who cures cancer* or whatnot.
This is where I fall, figuratively, on my knees and thank Satoshi Nakamoto from the bottom of my heart for giving us this tool, this opportunity to *finally* separate money from the state. If you hold a million bitcoins and everyone is worth a million 2014-USD in the future, you deserve every satoshi of it and more.

Yes, different means for storage, on site (your house) and off site (Dropbox's and/or Google's data centers), all containing strongly encrypted containers is very secure.
There simply is no way around storing a piece of paper securely. Because you have to have a strong passphrase for the truecrypt container! So my thinking is, if you have to either memorize (not a good idea) or write down (better idea) some really strong passphrase, why not directly use it as the input to create a private key (or keys)? All that container stuff makes sense, if you want to store files of some sort. But what you want is to store a large pseudo-random number (nothing else is a bitcoin private key).
@_date: 2014-11-26 18:25:24
The wallet.dat file contains the private keys to your addresses. If you lose the private keys, you lose all bitcoins sent to the corresponding addresses.
One rule with bitcoin is, to *never* delete a wallet-file or private key. Exactly because of the reason you gave: you never know if not sometime in the future someone or something might send something to an old address. I remember reading in this subreddit of a guy who accidentally sent ... 800-ish bitcoins (I can't remember for sure) to an old MTGOX address. This could have easily been an old address of his own he mistakenly copied from somewhere in his transaction history.
My recommendation is this: create an encrypted container-file of around 50 MB using TrueCrypt or similar software. Use a [strong password]( Don't hesitate to write it down, having one piece of paper with it in your wallet and another at home somewhere safe. Just put any old wallet-files, unencrypted or the password in a textfile along with it, PDFs or JPEGs of your (non cold) paper wallets, text files with Electrum or BIP39 seeds and so on into this container. Then copy that container to an USB drive, Dropbox, e-mail it to yourself, whatever.

I don't know of any exchanges in Guinea. But maybe your relatives can convince merchants who they buy from to accept bitcoin. How's the local currency doing? Is the inflation high? Are there strong capital controls on exchanging into other currencies and gold? The shittier the local currency, the easier it should be to convince people to accept bitcoin.
I'd say, just try it. Worst case is they send the btc back, you buy back into fiat and send via WU like before.
What would also be cool, is when you find and contact others who work abroad and are from Guinea to also adopt bitcoin. The more people in Guinea run around with more purchasing power in their pockets in the form of bitcoin, the faster merchant adoption will come, and/or the emergence of exchanges and payment processors.

I use only the *account 0*, so I'm not really using much of the hierarchical aspect of *HD*. I also don't use the Public Parent --&gt; Public Child Key functionality. I do use that with Electrum, where I have a *watch only* installation on an online PC and the full version with the seed on an offline PC.

* Memorizing the 12 words
* [SSSS]( into 2-of-3 shares just in case I forgot the seed

Stopped reading there. People should learn2economy first, then write articles.

Any company that does not act economically rational loses customers to those who do. The fact that a company, which invests in aggression (something their customers don't want) instead of a better product (something their customers want) will go out of business to the advantage of the companies who did not invest in aggression does not rely on "my" plan, trust or anything of that kind. It is a simple economic fact.
An example: Do you really fear that Amazon secretly trains assassins somewhere deep in an old salt mine to take out programmers and marketing staff from Apple and Barnes &amp; Noble? I guess not. Why should they? People who create a company as valuable and profitable as Amazon earn shit loads of money by just doing what they do. The reward for amazon.com-ninjas is tiny compared to the risk of losing massive amounts of customers, if the story leaks.
But even if the CEO of Amazon was an evil mastermind, creating this valuable company only for the purpose to one day, finally being able to fund his private ninja army. He has to buy real estate where the ninjas train, weapons, people who train them, tanks, cars, etc. etc. etc. Plus all the overhead to keep it a secret.
If he did that, the prices of Amazons services would rise in an instant, making them incompetent to outbid their competitors, shrinking their profits, which in turn, makes it harder to finance the secret ninja-army.
Again, this is not my opinion, just like it's not my opinion that a rock falls downwards if you drop it. Its (economic) fact.
And besides: If you are more afraid of a company who became valuable by providing services and peaceful cooperation, than of governments who killed in the 20th century alone more than 100 million people, you really should introspect a while and weed out all that government propaganda which obviously has been instilled in your mind. I'm not trying to provoke you by saying that. It really is true, that governments have it in their best interest to convince you, that if it weren't for them, you would have to watch out that none of your neighbors hits you over the head and eats your flesh.
Of course, all while they are incarcerating people for consuming the wrong kind of plant, spying on everybody, killing thousands of innocent people, many children by remotely operated drones and so on. The list of atrocities is almost infinite.

Werner von Braun was a full blown Nazi and very much of what is now just normal tech in space- and aircraft is known because of him.
The point is: It doesn't matter. The science is tested, the code is open. It doesn't matter who invented it, or who wrote it, if the whole world can verify its validity.
The question should be asked the other way around: *Who would the inventor of Bitcoin have to be, for you to use it without it being open source and peer reviewed by the public?*

Wasting water.. are you serious? What happens to the water, after you pour it over someone? Does it dematerialize and vanish from the universe? No, it's reabsorbed into the circulation that all water is part of.
What you are wasting, if anything, is the energy to bring that water into the bucket and cooling it down. I estimate that cost to be less than 10 cents.
So, are you telling me, that you try to look out for every 10 cents of possible wastefulness in your operations? Could it be, that if you actually did, you would waste even more energy trying not to waste energy?

I don't follow... what has the price of bitcoin in USD-terms to do with trying to catch high's and low's right? How is it important if you trade 1000 BTC between $1 and $3 or 1 BTC between $1000 and $3000?


Born from fire. I increased my BTC holdings during the bear market between the end-2013 crash and 2015-recovery. I haven't read Saifedean Ammous' "The Bitcoin Standard" yet, but judging form this video here:  I'd say: if you really understand bitcoin and economics on this level, holding isn't that tough, even through a bear market. Nobody can expect continual price increase, week after week after week. That's just unrealistic. You've got to be in it for the fundamentals, or you'll fold, because price decline will happen again and again. It's just part of the market.

There really isn't more to it than sha256'ing the passphrase (+a numeral, account, whatever)
I wouldn't use diceware though. Instead I'd use Electrum or a BIP39 mnemonic. The reason being, with those you start from a 128 bit random number and convert that into a corresponding set of words. With diceware you estimate the randomness of a word from a set and hope to have chosen enough to have higher or equal entropy than 128 bits. That's probably super-paranoia speaking right there, but still, why waste the opportunity to have something compatible with current bitcoin software.

For additional security: encrypt with BIP38, print out multiple copies to distribute to trusted places in case your house burns down. Don't forget that passphrase! Maybe write it down too and store separately, also in a few places. Or make a m-of-n-address/key-pair) OR: If using Linux is an absolute no-go for you: Make that backup of everything you've meant making anyway for months. You know what I'm talking about. Download bitaddress-ZIP. Go offline. Unplug the cable, turn off the wifi, what ever it takes. Create the paper wallet. Reinstall your operating system and restore the backup. But make sure you can access your blockchain account after the reinstall.

The problem with a rooted phone is, every process runs under the user with the highest privilege, who is root. All apps can do everything with everything. They can read and write each others data and memory. All it takes is one security flaw in your browser that installs malware and extracts everything it needs to get the coins on your phone. This of course is not specific to bitcoin. Every app is then vulnerable. It's only that the vulnerability in a system with a bitcoin wallet app is costly, compared to say, a guy knowing what your flappy birds high score is.

The cycle is not something fictional I invented. But lets get past that.
The violence thing: This is always a talk about the better of two bad choices. If the national currency is losing value too quickly, or there are unbearable trade restrictions tied to it, people will opt for an alternative and bitcoin can be that. Currently it's cash, mostly USD at that. You have to remember, that about a third of the worlds GDP (if it makes any sense to call it that) is in the black market. So people are currently avoiding state violence at great length, bitcoin will make this even easier, with more options regarding international trade.
Your last paragraph baffles me. First, if you directly pay your stuff in bitcoin, how can this ever be subject to fractional reserve? It's like every satoshi is some tiny amount of gold you actually have (to stay with the gold analogy). The cool thing is, that banking is not necessary. And if banking institutions are established, which very well might be the case, for example to have faster transaction times, well: of course they can go fractional, but if the customers demand audits, they are much easier done in bitcoin, than in gold+IOUs.

Your argument is invalid. The landlord doesn't need to know about bitcoin. All he cares about is the price of billing electricity by the kWh and the price of electricity by flat rate. He'll choose the lower one. That's the beauty of a price system.


You are right. Without demand, even scarcity doesn't create a price. That was sloppy language on my part. Thanks for pointing that out.
Please define *intrinsic value*. If you are thinking, that "the intrinsic value of something is the amount of work that was necessary to obtain that something", you are most certainly wrong. If such a thing as *intrinsic value* exists, this is not it.


If you want to have an argument, you are doing it wrong. You are trying to confirm your claim by just rephrasing your initial claim: that bitcoins are worthless. I told you, that the amount it took to produce something is not the value of it. The amount of what, would be the first question, you'd have to answer... 


Wrong. Bitcoins have very valuable attributes, at least to me and to a lot of other people, which explains the relatively high price. Those attributes are: scarcity, digital (meaning, made of information and not taking up physical space), secure against counter-fitting, not controlled by a minority.
If those attributes have no value to you, that's ok. But you can't claim that this is an objective assessment by you. What is valuable to you, might not be valuable to me either. As I said, if you don't value those attributes of bitcoins, that's ok. I do, so I ask you one last time to refrain from calling me a unwitting fool for buying them.
The example with the tulips you brought up is interesting indeed. If you are REALLY interested in economics and not just trying to act smarter than the rest of us, I recommend to read *Early Speculative Bubbles and Increases in the Supply of Money* by *Doug French* [1]. There's a whole chapter on the tulip mania in this book.

It is fascinating how most people simply take an income tax as something like the sunset. It's just something that's there and we have to live with. Just one hundred years go income tax was very rare and highly unusual. The government only was involved in well under 10% of the GDP (not 40 to 60 like today), money gained purchasing power from year to year, you could travel across whole continents without any passport of any kind, move to other countries and open businesses. Then the socialist and fascists states happened, the unholy alliance of government and banks emerged. The wars became absolute targeting mostly civilians. About 250 million people were either directly killed in war, through genocide, or starved to death by states.
Imagine civilization. Imagine the claimed services the state provides are now paid for voluntarily by you, because they can't tax bitcoin, because who says you even have them, *if* you feel they deserve your money. If you don't feel like that, you don't pay them. War on terror? No thanks. War on drugs? I don't think so. Education? Ok, but you'll have to compete with education agencies A, B and C who do a way better job.

I was referring to the stats for the expansion of the money supply there. Later I discredited the stats for the increase in consumer prices. Two different pairs of shoes. There is not much you can lie about in the report for money production, you can cheat quite a bit on why the prices didn't *actually* increase *that* much as you might think. The CPI is really made up. Arguments like this are standard for it: "You know, a car that wold have cost 20'000 usd 5 years ago costs now 25'000, but you get an iPod connection and front light wipers with it, so in a sense it's actually cheaper, right?"

Filming it, while you unpack it, is a good idea. Kind of like a CCD-notary. I would pack the gold coins into a paper wrapper and than mark it with a permanent marker in a distinguished way, all while filming it too.
But yes, a customer friendly service to turn gold into bitcoin would be awesome. Also to have the bitcoin as a sort of common denominator for fiat, i.e. to do Gold &lt;---&gt; Bitcoin &lt;---&gt; Fiat.

What are you even saying? If you blow some dude and he gives you 10 dollars, you earned that, it's not stolen.
The same goes with gold: If you blow some dude ... I mean, if you dig up gold from the ground, you got yourself some money. You did the digging, you earned it.
And bitcoin? Same thing: if you want to eliminate all non-bitcoin moneys from the example: You blow some dude for electricity and another for a miner, and another for some bandwidth and voila! You earned yourself some money in the form of bitcoin.
Of course in the gold example you would have to also blow yourself a shovel and a pick or something to start gold mining.
If you are confused about the creation of money, read about the *regression theorem*. [1] It describes how you get from a state of barter to money in an economic environment. But really, the only money that qualifies as "stealing from others as it is created" is printed money, because no work was involved in it's creation ("printing" doesn't count. Also, only a few percent of the fiat in circulation is actually printed. Most is just numbers in bank computers).

I would recommend it for holding a lot of bitcoins, yes.
First, you have to secure the offline installation itself, because it holds the private keys/seed. This is why it's encrypted. You have to choose a passphrase that is hard enough, so in case the offline computer gets stolen or otherwise compromised, you can restore from the seed backup and transfer the bitcoins to a new, secure address faster than the thieves can crack the encryption.
I simply remembered the 12 word seed and used it as the encryption passphrase as well. This way, cracking the encryption is as costly as cracking the seed itself, so there's actually no benefit to stealing the offline computer. And being 128 bits of entropy strong, every attempt at cracking it is futile anyway.
This leaves one security risk: your brain. If you lose somehow the ability to remember the seed, by death or brain damage, then the access to the bitcoins would be lost forever. To secure against that, I recommend splitting the 12 word seed into *m* of *n* [Shamirs Secret Sharing Scheme]( and to come up with a strategy to store them securely and independently from each other. Think about giving sealed envelopes to trustworthy relatives, your lawyer, a bank deposit box, your physical wallet, your gun safe, a water tight box in the backyard (buried on a cloudy day so the spy satellites don't know when and where you dug the hole), and so on.
I say to myself, in my head, the seed at least once a day, so I won't forget it. Using it as the hard drive encryption passphrase also has the added benefit that you *have* to type it in every time you start the offline computer. But don't do that in public, you never know if a security camera looks over your shoulder.

With a stable or deflationary money supply, my (cash) savings wouldn't have to do any sort of economic work. If my money doesn't lose value, but things I buy get cheaper, or better at the same price, I don't need to earn an interest on my savings. Or if you want to see it the other way around, why would I want to earn 5% interest per year on my savings that deprecate in value 10% a year, when I can have a deflationary money that appreciates in value 3% a year?
What you are writing kind of makes sense, I'm not denying that. But it doesn't turn out that way in the real world. Probably due to bad politics, probably due to the impotence of people to adjust to the market in the correct way, or for whatever other reason.
I just googled what would yield me the highest interest rates where I live. And that would be 2.75% if I tie my savings for 7 years. This barely compensates for inflation. As soon as I want to save somewhere I can get my money out any time, at least in parts, the interest rate drops to lower than 1% and this doesn't compensate for inflation at all.
You can call it ridiculous all you want. That really isn't an argument. The link you provided gives no example of deflation being detrimental to an economy. I didn't claim that deflation has *no* impact on consumer behavior, I'm claiming that the impact is a good one. When I'm certain that the money I'm holding won't lose value over time, or maybe even gain in value, I won't go out and buy stuff, only to escape inflation. I've seen reports from Argentina, that people buy *cars* just to escape inflation. If you call the lack of this nonsensical buy-manias good for economic growth, well, if you want to. I see that as a reason why booms and busts in this sort of economy are so extreme, instead of mild and steady in a "gold standard economy".

I upvote this, based on the recommendation of Bruce Schneier [1]. To anybody who doesn't know who Bruce Schneier is, please do some research. He's one of the leading heads in the crypto-scene.
What works for me, is having a password, that is really good, but also really hard to remember. Not impossible, but really hard to remember. Doing a Sharmir's Secret Sharing Split of that really hard password, and distributing that split to trusted parties, to avoid simply writing it down. Again, this is just in case I do forget the password.
This password is then used for two things:
1) As master password for KeepassX, my password manager of choice and
2) As passphrase for one of my GPG private keys (4096 bits).
I encrypt the KeepassX-file, that stores my passwords with the corresponding public key and upload the encrypted file to my dropbox. The gpg-private-key is, encrypted by the very strong passphrase, backed up to a usb-thumbdrive. This way, the passwords in the keepassx-file are secured by two methods: symmetrically using the secure passphrase and asymmetrically by RSA.
The gpg-private-key never touches anything unencrypted and never gets uploaded anywhere, not even encrypted.

What do you mean with "hacked my wallet"? If someone has a copy of your wallet-file and at the time of copying the password was "123456" then of course to decrypt it, the attacker will have to use "123456". If you change the password on your copy of the wallet afterwards, how should it have any effect on the copy the attacker already has? Like, if you send me a photo and then photoshop it, does the photo in my e-mail change? Of course not.
If you suspect that you are running on a compromised system, you must transfer the funds immediately to a trusted wallet (like for example on your smart phone) and re-install that system.

No, because this defeats the purpose of money. You don't want something that is "more available". You want something that is stable in price. Copper is "more available" than gold, so why don't people just abandon gold for copper?
This is purely a thought experiment anyway. How likely is it, that suddenly people lose their coins left and right? Not very. Also because the more are lost, the more valuable the rest becomes, which then leads to people taking more care of their coins.
I can't foresee the future. All I know is that the first mover advantage is even stronger in anything that profits from network effect. This is the reason why we still use IPv4, SMTP, GSM and a lot of other protocols, for which far better replacements are around, but the advantages don't outweigh the network effect by any means.

That's what I thought too. But I wouldn't be too worried about it. There sure will be people who get the blockchain via IP as well as via DVB-T and do comparisons. As soon as there's a mismatch, their evil plan, if they should have one, is foiled.
I'm starting to think, that decentralization is something we all should have on our minds all the time. But if centralization comes up, like a dominant mining-pool, or a blockchain broadcaster, that isn't the end of world, as long as the networks cost to foil the evil plot is negligible compared to the cost the would-be evil-doer puts on himself.
For dominant mining pools, what people forget is, that one simple change in the mining algorithm means you can basically dump ASICs worth thousands of bitcoins. So what attack would satisfy even the most primitive economic thinking here?
And for this... As long as the network doesn't DEPEND on blockchain broadcasts like that, why not? If they turn out evil, we won't use it anymore. We only need two or three people on watch towers, looking for differences in the two signals.

The problem with that is, that the recipient of the note has to trust who hands it to him. Because the only way to check if the address associated with that private key is to import the key, at which point the person who wants to pay has to trust the recipient. This makes a transaction like that effectively a n-to-n trust relationship. You have to trust everyone who you want to prove the reserves of your paper wallet to, and those people have to trust you to not have a copy of that paper wallet.
Personally, I don't see any problem with bitcoin IOUs. Prove of reserves is easy enough with bitcoin, multisig wallets and similar tech can make it even more secure for the customer. I'm predicting that in our daily lives, we will mostly pay with digital bitcoin IOUs, simply because if there is a trust relationship with a company who handles your shopping account, payments can be near instant instead of waiting on average 10 minutes for a confirmation.

Bitaddress.org being a scam is highly unlikely. It so commonly used and thus tested thousands of times by thousands of people.

Look, if I'm wrong that in many African countries, the governments are nothing short of a war-lord gang and the currencies are unstable like house of cards, great! Love to hear that this is only some sort of myth. But I don't think I am wrong, in general. Of course you can bring a counter example, like you did, thanks for that. But I never said that there aren't counter examples.
Look what I found, [inflation rates, sorted by country](

* Egypt: 10.61
* Eritrea: 12.30
* Ghana: 15.30	
* Malawi: 22.50
* Sudan: 46.80
Bitcoins volatility might be a bitch, but at least volatility has the potential of also going up in value. Those inflation rates are comparable to bitcoins volatility. Also, the inflation is only one aspect, regime uncertainty is the other. How sure can I be, that my money won't be confiscated, just cuz? This is a problem in developed, industrial western Nations, how bad can it be in Eritrea? I'm guessing it is very bad, which is why every year [Africans die trying to get to European shores]( Having your savings in your brainwallet, or a well hidden cold storage piece of paper *might* be of advantage, when I'm otherwise so desperate to get to some sort of rule of law, that I risk not only my life, but also that of my children.

It looks like everything is encrypted client side. If this is true, and I'm trusting the EFF that they are not bullshitting about this, then there's no reason not to store private keys of hot wallets in there. Maybe let it mature a little, before using it for large amounts, but large amounts should be in cold storage anyway, so why not?
I use Keepassx on my PC and store private keys and Electrum seeds there too. Its database-file is encrypted with AES with a strong passphrase and then again with a 4096 bit RSA key and I have no hesitation to upload it to Dropbox.
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:04:40
Wow, THAT is some cold storage right there. Amazing! I love the true random numbers and how large 6^80 is. I would trust this, no doubt.
There is only one critique I can think of, which is this:


Don't assume that. In fact, assume someone very capable is actively trying to get your seed. If you are still secure then, everything is fine.
You could split the seed into *n* shares of which any *m* of them can reconstruct the whole with [Sharmis Secret Sharing Scheme]( [PassGuardian]( also capable of running offline from your USB drive, can create split shares. Then you can place the individual shares in secure, independent places. If any one of them gets compromised, the attacker still can't get the seed. For example, you can have one share in your gun vault, one on your person, one in a bank deposit box and one with your parents. Any 2 of those 4 shares could reconstruct the seed. A burglar may break into your place and get the one in the vault, but he won't also break into your parents house (which he doesn't even know exists) or even the bank. So if you come home and see the vault opened, depending on what takes longer, you get one of the other shares, reconstruct the seed and send everything to a new address.

Yes there is.
Let's say we want to establish a social framework in which stealing is justified. If it is justified for Alice to steal from Bob, then it is justified for Bob to steal from Alice. But the reason why Alice steals from Bob in the first place, was to keep the stuff she stole from Bob. So Alice anticipates Bob to refrain from stealing, while she herself steals. For stealing to make any sense, it has to be justified for Alice, but not for Bob. And now we produced a consequence that is in direct contradiction to the initial assumption, that stealing is justified.
For it to work, you would have to establish arbitrary categories for Alice and Bob. For example, being male and female. To make the social norm "stealing is justified" logical consistent, you have to extend it based on that arbitrary category. Then the norm is: "stealing is justified, if you are female and the person you steal from, is male"
Thankfully we don't only have to rely on logic to determine if a proposed rule or norm is valuable. Putting people in arbitrary categories is nonsensical upon first view and can therefore easily be dismissed.
What's left now, is to realize, that "a bunch of people voted for that guy" is yet another arbitrary category with no ties to physical truth.

That makes no sense to me. If the demand for money decreases naturally, meaning caused by the market, then the reason is, because people defer the spending of their earned money into the future, aka. saving. Why would the central bank then create even more money? Imagine that with anything else but money: If the demand for anything decreases, why would you produce even more of it?

I think the problem with centralized blockchain distribution is that you get a forged blockchain. For example, what if you sold someone a chocolate candy bar, he sends you some btc, you wait for a confirmation and hand the buyer the bar. Later at home you find out, that he never sent a transaction and the confirmation was forged.
This is of course completely ridiculous. The cost of running a digital TV network far outweighs the potential gain you might get from stealing from people who accept bitcoins. And if you are buying.. I don't know... 30% of Exxon Mobile stock or something like that, where it actually would make economical sense to steal, you wouldn't trust some side channel blockchain broadcast.

Ok, thanks for that last message. I think I'm satisfied now, but only want you to know, that I disagree on some points.


Yes, wages are adjusted for inflation. The fact that although this inflation was forced on the population and the average wealth didn't deprecate in the same manner, can't be solely be attributed to wage adjustments. Increased productivity due to technological advancements is what I see as the savior of  the average income earner. After all, isn't that what Keynesian economists propose, at least in theory? To match the increased productivity with an increase in the money supply?


This is a problem in my opinion. The purchasing power should go up, as technology and productivity increases. Imagine an economy where all shoes are hand made, making one pair of shoes worth about half a month wages of an average worker. It would be a sign of economic mis-regulation if, although shoes are produces mainly by machines and at a 10th of the original cost, they still cost half my monthly income. If it's easier and cheaper to produce shoes, my purchasing power relative to shoes, should go up, not stay the same. And since almost every field of production generally sees advancements, the purchasing power in general should go up, not stay the same, over time. Another way to phrase this, you sure have heard of it: I am richer than Ludwig XIV. I may not have the same amount of wealth relative to my fellow countrymen, but the amount of money I have buys me more and better stuff, because of increased productivity.


This is a consequence of inflation, not the other way around. If the value of my cash savings wouldn't deprecate over time, I wouldn't bother investing in anything. And I wouldn't invest (implicitly by depositing at a bank) nearly all of my savings. Don't you think it's telling you something, that of all the examples you mentioned (assets, house, stocks) two are an already popped bubble and one is about to burst? It is an artificial necessity to invest in anything as an average Joe. It uses up my free time to read up on good investment strategies, or just blindly trust my bank. I would always chose a sound money that doesn't lose value over time, but maybe even gains value, any time over a monetary system, that relies on lending and speculating.


Well, "we" don't know that. You may believe that, but if you look at the evidence of these claims, you'll find none. I take it, you subscribe to the Keynesian school of economics? Are you a professional, meaning, do you have a degree, or do you actively work in the field?

(1) Increased sales: Not really. Maybe a little in the beginning of him accepting bitcoin, but I think once all the bitcoiners visited, the bitcoin volume goes down pretty quickly. I wouldn't promise him too much in that regard.
(2) I would do this (the idea is inspired by a video that was linked here):
* You ask him to install a bitcoin app, preferably Mycelium. You show him how a transaction works, i.e. how he can request the right fiat amount etc. Do a few transactions back and forth so he can get used to it.
* Help him making the backup, maybe store it for him, if he trusts you.
* Then import an address of which *you* control the private key
* Give him 50 fiat-units cash and tell him, that as soon as the balance in the app shows 50 or more, the two of you are even. If he wants to keep accepting bitcoin, he then should either change the seed/key so he is in control, or call you to help him set up with coinbase, bitpay or some other merchant tool provider.
This way, he has almost no risk and work and he sees that there really isn't anything magical about bitcoin.

Maybe I'm confusing something, or the terminology is not clear in this regard. But the way I understand it is, that being able to run apps *temporarily* as root is not equal to *a rooted phone*. For example, I'm running CyanogenMod on my Samsung Galaxy S3. While I can grant apps root privileges, I have to explicitly do so. I don't call that "rooted".


That's great. Then there's no problem, I think.
What I meant with "don't install anything you are not absolutely sure of on that device" is this:
* Be sure of the place you get the software from. Google Play Store, F-Droid, Amazon App Store, Apple App Store, the authors website/githup page with proper SSL certificate. Don't just download something linked to in a forum or similar, possibly unsecured sources.
* If possible, use Open Source Software
* Prefer software of reputable authors over software from unknown sources. The more reputable the author/company of the software, the more forgiving you can be with lack of source code, simply because, for example McDonald's Inc., even though their app may not be open source, you can be fairly certain they don't build malware into the apps, because the damage they'd suffer from bad press if this comes out far outweighs the bitcoin thefts they may or may not be able to pull off. But if someone post for example in this subreddit his new cool bitcoin price ticker app, and it's not open source or you can't verify it, don't touch that..

* Lets say my seed is 'correct horse battery staple'. I fire up hash256 as follows: `hash256 10000 'correct horse battery staple'` which gives me the last hash of `eb63fb148576664a8da27cf1ab73159bc00a0e4f311e37e97d4392ebb02c336c`
* Now I paste this into the bitaddress.org tab for wallet details which gives me the private key `5KbxKMFDLB2SVcF9RoqB8X5duq17GNLGNm4EFy5CyXYg5VD1jAj` but really nothing but the same number in base58 with parity bytes.
* This private key is the passphrase for a crypto-container image for truecrypt or dm-crypt/cryptsetup (I'd use cryptsetup, it's preinstalled on most Linux distros)
* In this container I just throw everything. Old wallet files, PDFs of paper wallets, and additional seeds from other deterministic wallets.
* This container file can then be secured on USB drives or CD Roms and put in save places.
This way, everything can be effectively stored in a sort of brain wallet.

Technically, of course centralized systems are more cost effective, faster etc. than decentralized networks.
BUT, we don't live in an ideal world. So one has to add human error, corruption, (state) violence, and so forth.
And then, a system, not governed by humans, but by the law of math and physics, is cheaper after all.
It's kind of the same with the beloved gold standard. Don't get me wrong, I love gold and I would love to have used all my life money backed 100% by gold. And maybe even [someone]( wants to offer something like that, and maybe that someone is a 100% legit person. BUT, you have to add the pirates in expensive suits.
So, what is more cost effective? A centralized, e-token-enized gold backed money *that doesn't exist and won't exist as long as governments exist*, or bitcoin?

+1 for VPN. That's not a bad in general and there so many providers who accept bitcoin for their service now. I'm recommending ProXPN.com. Currently they sponsor Twit.tv's show *Security Now* and with the offer code from the show, you get the service for 5 usd a month for a year. (and no, I'm not a promotion guy or work for proxpn or twit, I just think they are cool and I'm happy with their products)
Alternatively, you can go through the TOR network.

If you try to use gold in every day life, you are going to have bad time. You will want a bank or some other trusted entity to issue a more user friendly currency, backed by gold.
This always turns into fractional reserve banking. Always. Because the profit that can be made from it is too tempting. Also, in a somewhat limited version, it's not too high a risk.
But even if the bank is 100% trustworthy and has 100% backing of their currency, sooner or later the domestic government, or a foreign one, will try to take control over the money supply and since they have most of the guns, they'll succeed. After that, a complete fiat money system is inevitable. War, vote buying, government programs with no profit margins (= *all* government programs),... are the reasons for that.
With bitcoin, we have all the properties of gold that make it a good money, without its limitations that make some sort of currency issuance necessary. This breaks the *gold -&gt; currency backed by gold -&gt; fractional reserve -&gt; government takeover -&gt; fiat -&gt; fight to go back to gold -&gt; currency backed by gold -&gt; ...*-cycle.
And on top of that, you get all the power of programmable, teleportable, denial-able, non-physical'ness of bitcoin.

I wouldn't travel with anything that screams *bitcoin*, because of TSA agents. Google it, there already were incidents where those IQ-of-70 government employees wanted to "see the bitcoins" a traveler supposedly had on him, because he wore a bitcoin t-shirt or something like that. Or was it stickers in his bag with the bitcoin logo and they thought those are bitcoins? I can't remember.
Anyway, I'd stealth it as much as possible, for example by utilizing a brain wallet, aka, memorizing a 12 word Electrum or BIP32/39 seed, or taping it into a book so it won't fall out, or disguise it as a bookmark or what ever..

Alright, I'll go super-biased mode:
* No, actually that would be good news^tm . The more draconian the laws, the more people will flock to bitcoin. Also you have to think globally. Bitcoin is an industry now. If country A becomes more draconian, well, there's still 200 other countries to work in.
* security holes is always a problem. This is equally valid for banking software and servers. I have trust in the open source development model and the many eyes approach. Back doors are really a legacy banking only phenomenon. They are mandatory there.
* There are already solutions for quantum safe crypto, including for bitcoin
* Doesn't matter. The code and the network is independent from Satoshi. He could be Hitlers clone and it wouldn't matter.
If any of those happen one day, the price will drop, I guess. But not to zero. That is over. And anything above zero is the only thing that matters for bitcoin to work.

The government gives itself the permission to initiate force against everybody within the nations borders. Initiation of force means, that they can use force against someone, although this person did not harm or threaten anyone.
Like a robber who threatens you with his knife in order to rob you of the contents of your wallet initiates force against you, the government threatens you to throw you in a cage, if you don't give up a certain amount of your money and if you try to use another money but theirs.
While you have the moral right to defend yourself against both acts of aggression (the robber and the government), defending against government aggression is called tax evasion, money laundering or revolt. Since the government declared its own aggression against you legal, defending yourself against that aggression, is illegal.
This is why in any monopoly that may arise in a free market, evading this monopoly is as easy as switching your preferred wallet app and doing some exchanges at Mt.Gox, while evading a monopoly occupied by the government is a life threatening endeavor.

You have to have different tiers of Wallets.
* 1: **Cold storage** - Majority of savings. Cumbersome to access, but highly secure
* 2: **Spending wallet** - The amount you would also carry around as cash in your physical wallet. If you lose what is in here, you cry a little, but get on with your life. For some that's 100 USD, for others 10'000.
* 3: **3rd Party/Webwallet** - Services like exchanges or changetip that hold the private key to your addresses, or services like blockchain.info who might encrypt the private key, but still offer way more attack surface hosting millions of wallets in one place, than having millions of places hosting one wallet.
My recommendation of **Cold Storage**: [Cold Storage with Electrum](
For **spending wallet**: On your smartphone or tablet, Mycelium if you use Android, Breadwallet if you use iOS. Don't root your device, make a physical paper backup of the seed, don't install anything you are not absolutely sure of on that device. No stupid games or anything like that. If you absolutely must have the smartphone equivalent of the Internet Explorer with 15 toolbars, get a second device just for your bitcoin wallet. This can be a cheap 50 bucks, or used (but factory reset!) phone only using wifi.
For **3rd party and webwallets**: Long passwords, different passwords for each site (use a password manager), 2FA, **never NEVER click on links in e-mail**. If there's something the host wants to tell you, he'll do so if you log in via the normal website which you type in yourself, so you won't visit B&lt;capital I as in Idiot&gt;ockchain.info instead of B&lt;lower case L as in Love&gt;ockchain.info. Only have the funds you absolutely must have there. If you are a trader, well, you're probably going to have quite some coins on that exchange. But in any other case, as soon as you bought them, send them to your cold storage.

Exactly. That is why the fees for these services would be (and are, as I'm sure those services do exist) relatively high*. Thankfully we have bitcoin now, with all the nice features of gold (accept for shininess of course), but with the added bonus of being non-physical and teleportable.
*actually, with surplus reserves of a certain percentage amount of the average transaction volume and a large enough network of offices, this wouldn't be such a big problem. Albert may send gold to Berta, but Bob may send gold to Charlie (who is in Cabildo). So the Belgrade office has now Bobs ounce to compensate the one they gave to Berta and so on. The hard part is probably not losing track of all the gold amounts so you don't accidentally give out the same gold twice. Someone totally should make a pseudonymous public ledger to keep track of all that transactions... ;)
@_date: 2014-09-20 22:53:48
In the Receive tab of Electrum, you see the addresses. When you send bitcoins, what Electrum does is, it produces a transaction which is then signed with the corresponding private key. But you can also sign any other message you want to prove ownership of the private key without revealing the private key itself. You can do that by right-clicking on an address and then clicking on "Sign/verify message".

No, you are who is delusional. There is nothing special about the unit "bitcoin". It's simply 100 million satoshis. So there there can only be 21x1'000'000x100'000'000 satoshis ever. If, for whatever reason, all but one bitcoin is lost increasing the divisibility by 21x1'000'000 is by far the easier route. You may then call the smallest unit a bananatoshi if you want to. In fact, this sort of change requires only a *soft fork*. Increasing the divisibility might be necessary even without such an unlikely scenario taking place. When the price per satoshi increases to a point where it's too high to be used as a unit for payment, we might want to add a few decimal places.
@_date: 2014-08-12 18:50:44
That's the same thing, just renamed.
If you try to think about stuff like this, I recommend to start from a consistent base of thought.
These are the facts:
* Corporations don't exist, only people exist
* Nobody has the right to initiate force against anybody else. Like, I can't just go ahead and take 10% of your profits, just because I'm such a handsome fellow
* Everybody owns the consequences of their actions. If I rob someone, I go to prison for 10 years, and not I go 5 and then the rest of the population of my country goes half a day each or something like that. No, I go 100% of the time to prison, because I own the consequences of my actions 100%. Respectively, if I create wealth, I get to own 100% of that too, and not 60% and 40% get divided up among the population (after politicians get big cut, of course)
This is a sound basis one can work from. If you want to google that, google for "non aggression principle" and "private property". Any other fundamental assumptions lead to logical conflicts which manifests in the real world as non-functional.
If you want to tackle the problem of pollution by oil drilling, what can you do?
Assume you live in a world, where this is the basis for human interaction.
First, to stay with the oil-spill example: The golf of Mexico, every foot of the coast line, every square foot of the water surface etc. belongs to someone. Like people who live at the coast, or have a boat rental service there. Or a company who guards the waters and allows people to fish in their territory for a fee. Generally, if anybody can make any sort of wealth from owning a resource, that resource is going to be owned by someone. If only to have a nice patch of ocean to relax on a boat.
The problem with the oil spill in the golf of Mexico really was, that the government allowed BP to drill, the owners of the coast line had no saying in it, the ocean is illegal to own and the fuckup BP did had to be paid by tax-payers. The politicians didn't care, because it's not their ocean, or their money.
Now, if you were an owner of some coast line, or the owner of fishing-territory, or of ocean-surface for recreation, would you allow BP to undertake such a risky operation on your property?
What would BP have to do for you to allow them to drill on your property?

The fact that the client chose to not invest does not have to be causally related to the conversation. Many people assume causality way too early.

All of those 3 are sub-optimal, and unnecessarily expensive.
Just install Electrum on an offline computer (like on a Ubuntu Live USB) and write down the seed on a piece of paper. Done. You have infinite addresse/key-pairs forever and all you have to do is backup that 12 word seed. You can remember it, you can Shamir Secret Sharing Scheme it, you can encrypt it and put them in many different places etc.
I would abstain from cold storage involving flash memory, or digital memory as a whole. These mediums always have a tendency to lose bits. But a piece of paper with 12 words on it will last for a hundred years. Especially if you use high quality paper and laminate it.

[SSSS]( a private key with [Bitaddress' Split Wallet feature]( and store the shares at different, trusted places. For example, make a 2-of-3-split and store one share at your home, one at a relatives home, and one on your person, like in your wallet.

If the seed is only used in an offline installation of Electrum (and written down on a piece of paper, memorized, ... for backup of course), there practically is no way of it being compromised. Never export a private key from the offline seed, never enter it on an online machine.
I made a diagram that hopefully explains the situation:
Of course you can use another electrum installation with a different seed instead of the android bitcoin wallet. It's just do demonstrate to have a strictly offline wallet with a separate seed from any online wallet you may use. But as long as you have your bitcoins sent to addresses from the offline seed (and you have it backed up), they are secure.

Electrum produces as many addresses as you need, it just stops displaying addresses after 5 consecutive empty addresses.
You can publish the addresses freely, nobody can do anything with them except sending you bitcoins.
The wallet is a file on the computer, but it can be reconstructed from the 12 word seed. To have a backup in case of a computer failure, simply write the seed on a piece of paper and store it securely.
To have additional protection against malicious software on your computer that scans the hard drive for bitcoin wallets, you should also encrypt the wallet with a strong passphrase. [Random.org]( can be used to produce a strong passphrase. There is no harm in also writing it down.

I think those objections are addressed in a reply by me to another post:
To that mafia scenario... It's getting late here, so I'll make this short: Maybe Youtube videos of lectures by David Friedman on the subject of poly legal systems can answer that objections to your satisfaction. They did for me, at least. Also there is the basic argument, that aggression is only economically viable, if you can outsource the cost of that aggression, like nation states do via taxes, dept and inflation. If a private company invests in aggression instead of better services and lower prices, they'll be outbid by competitors who don't invest in, for example, secret armies ready to overtake your land. Maybe the explanation of *DROs* (dispute resolution organisations) by Stefan Molyneux can help with that.

The bitcoin android wallet switched the backup format from a nice, textual version to a binary format. You can't easily just show the private keys. Keep the backup secure and import it into the new installation on your new phone.
Mycelium and Wallet32 both show you the BIP39 seed to easily back up your wallet and import to other BIP32+BIP39 compatible wallets. The Schildbach wallet unfortunately does not easily allow that.

Even if all else was equal, which it is not, this one is the number one reason, why X done by Y will never be the same as X being done by the government, for any group of people Y doing X:
The government has the monopoly on the initiation of force in a certain geographical area. The only way to stop the government from doing X is an armed revolt or slow and steady education about the universality of the non aggression principle.
For this particular example of X and Y, X being "having total control over the supply of money" and Y being the operator of a powerful mining pool: sell the money he is controlling and create a new money that doesn't have this weakness. Further, refuse to use the old money.

* app buys bitcoin at the current market rate. Depending on configuration it also asks if the user wants to pay a few percent or a few fiat units more to send to a) savings address, or b) charity, or c) tip for cashier, waiter etc. (Or a combination of the above)
A few percent here and there saved by the customer and held by the merchant can make a huge difference.

Nice straw man you've got there. The point is that jmw74 makes the extra ordinary claim that bitcoin will never be used as a protocol without people knowing that they are actually using bitcoin. Right now, from the top of my head, there are two ways to accomplish that: one I already mentioned, the other is using coloured coins or counterparty to transact titles to USD on top of bitcoin.
If jmw74 can provide evidence for his extra ordinary claim, that bitcoin can never be used by laypeople, like http today, I'll rest my case.
Until then: Fuck you and fuck your assumptions. I write code and tutorials. Just browse my comments here and you'll find them.

I don't get it. Why would anyone like $PROTOCOL integration into $APP? If I want to send someone bitcoins and we are communicating over WhatsApp, I ask him to copy and paste one of his bitcoin addresses into the conversation. I wouldn't want SMTP integration either, I'd just ask for his e-mail address, if I want to send him an e-mail. Or are we talking off-chain, like changetip.com?

You obviously don't get the point. But let me sum it up for you:
* He already had the blockchain, at least in a somewhat up do date version
* Because he's too lazy to back his shit up, he's putting unnecessary strain on the network
* Then he refuses to redownload the blockchain in a more network-friendly way via bittorrent
This is not about someone downloading and using bitcoin, this is about ignorance to the fact, that his "well, I'm just gonna redownload it again, bruh. Ma pc is super fast, bruh" attitude costs the network resources. Yes, the network can take that, but it's about the attitude.
Kind of like a guy who eats like a pig at a donation bases buffet and donates nothing, then when asked "wtf are you doing?" answers: "It says 'FREE - DONATIONS WELCOME', bruh! Don't worry, I have a huge stomach and can eat for days, bruh!"
It's okay if a homeless person comes up and eats like pig without giving something back, but not for a rich frat boy.
It's okay for a noob to just install bitcoin-qt and download the whole blockchain with it, but not for someone who's just too lazy to make a backup and refuses, for whatever reason, to use bittorrent.

**Electrum Cold Storage Step-by-Step-guide**
* 1: The GNU/Linux distro [Trisquel]( now includes Electrum in its default DVD image. You can just download and burn it to a DVD.
* 2: Remove network cable, or just don't connect to wifi. Then boot Trisquel and start Electrum. Then write down the 12 word seed on a piece of paper
* 3: Export the *master public key* and save it to a USB drive
* 4: Create a m-of-n [SSSS]( with previously saved  on a USB drive, like a 2-of-3 split
* 5: Print out the codes of the 3 splits.
* 6: Remember the 12 word seed. Make it something like a prayer in your head you tell yourself every day 3 times
* 7: Once you are confident, that you remembered the 12 words, destroy the single piece of paper with the seed on it
* 8: Place the splits in trustworthy places. For example, one for your mother, one for a friend, one for your lawyer.
* 9: Import the master public key into an Electrum installation of an online device. You can now see *only* the addresses and send your funds to them.
To access those funds:
* 1: create a transaction in the online, public key only installation of Electrum
* 2: save it to a USB drive
* 3: boot up Trisquel again and restore from seed
* 4: load the unsigned transaction from the USB drive
* 5: sign the transaction
* 6: save the signed transaction to the USB drive
* 7: load the signed transaction into the online installation of Electrum and broadcast it. Done.

Yes, I think so. But that's not what I did. I called that guy Mao and let me show you why. Let's get through this point by point and you can tell me, where you exit and become Mao.
If the answer to question *n* is **no**, proceed to question *n+1*. The first question you answer with **yes** determines your Mao-Level. The higher your Mao-Level, the nicer a person you are.
Definition: "initiate force" means, that the person who is met with force, did not previously act in a violent or fraudulent manner, nor did the configuration of his or her property infringe on other persons body or their property.
* 1: Do you *have* the right to initiate force against others? For example, threatening them with a gun to give you their money, or drive you to Las Vegas?
* 2: Can you *give* the right to initiate force against others to someone else? For example, you don't do the threatening yourself, but you pay someone money to do the threatening for you.
* 3: Is it possible, that *a group* of people *gains* rights the individual members of that group previously didn't have? For example: You don't have the right to initiate force, you can't give someone else the right to initiate force, but if you and that other guy band together, suddenly you have the right to initiate force against a third person or group of people.
* 4: Can you find any excuse to initiate force against other human beings? Please don't consider edge-cases like shooting someone in the leg who tries to jump off a building. We are talking general rules for human interaction between sane, adult human beings, not fringe cases.
* 5: Is there a moral difference to either force someone to work for you and give you the money they earned, or simply letting that person work and robbing it later from him or her?
* 6: Can you find any excuse to initiate force against the property of another human being?
If you reach Level 6, you are an Anarchist and abstain from initiating force against other people and their property. Even if you think it would be better if you did, like slapping someone who smokes. It would be better health-wise, but it's not up to you to make that call.
Any level lower than 6 is somewhere on a continuum between some liberal better-than-though-cunt and outright communist/fascist scum.

I wouldn't trust that the entropy of a hash of a part of a randomly chosen picture is high enough to store my money in it.
People have to realize, that proving randomness is a real, hard problem. Just look at all the exploits in supposedly random number generators, like /dev/random in Linux, that get discovered years after many people relied on that source of entropy.
Real randomness coming from high entropy is the foundation of good crypto. Don't screw with this foundation, or you'll regret it. Stay with what is proven to be secure, or at least, not proven to be insecure after years of exposure in the real world.

Hi, I'm doing almost the same thing as you, only I remember the 12 word seed and not a password that protects it.
What I did, is the following:
The offline-linux is on an encrypted hard drive (it's only an install option when setting up linux) and the passphrase to decrypt it, is the 12 word seed. This way, I am forced to type it in every time I boot up the offline machine, which hopefully will help me remembering it.
But, for the same concerns you have, memory loss or death, I also split the seed into a 2-of-3 Shamirs Secret Sharing Scheme parts and put them in strategically good places.

Holy shit, are you, and every other person who upvotes the two of you seriously this dumb or just trolling?
The initial question was, how would someone with no ability to check the blockchain for him or herself be able to still pay in an economy operating on cryptocurrency. People who meet this criterion could be for example old people who are unable and/or unwilling to use smartphones or computers to buy whatever they need.
Again, they cannot check the blockchain for themselves, so they have to trust a third party to do that for them. This third party is a bank, not some dumb fuck like you picking up a crayon and writing "bitcoin" on a piece of paper. You know what the difference between you and such a bank is? A bank with a good reputation, which proves its reserves regularly, which gets audited, which contractually promises to abstain from fractional reserve banking and which can and will get sued if they do not fulfill that contract, is trustworthy. You are not, because apparently you are not even able to read one simple English sentence.
I don't know why you feel you "found something here". Like what? The idea that there will be a market for banks in the future? Guess what, changetip.com is a bank. They issue digital bitcoin IOUs. No problem there.
Also, bank notes *is not* the same as fiat currency. To everybody who doesn't get that, how about educating yourself on the history of money a little further into the past than 100 years.

I for one am very skeptical of the usefulness of dedicated bitcoin-hardware wallets.
I would never store my life savings on a trezor. I trust an offline, encrypted installation of Linux on a laptop, in addition to a [SSSS]( backup of the seed of my deterministic wallet more than a new comer device like trezor. Linux and [LUKS]( is mature, it withstood the test of time, and it's practically free.
The amount of money I carry with me on my phone (not iPhone, but an Android device) is not larger than what I would carry in my physical fiat wallet, so I don't lose sleep over the fact, that I might lose it, and because I'm not an idiot who installs everything that comes along, I'm not afraid of malware.
I get that setting up an encrypted Linux installation with Electrum and all the rest is not something my grandma can and will do. But I'm used to that. I install almost every piece of new hardware some of my family members buy, why would it be different here?
**TL;DR:** I see no advantage of dedicated hardware like Trezor or Entropy over letting your computer literate nephew setup you up with a cold storage Electrum installation and a cheap ass smartphone to spend bitcoins on the go.

Destroying the SD card is kind of over the top...
I would encrypt the Raspbian system. This way you don't have to destroy the card. Just overwrite it once to erase the part where the header information for the luks-container is stored and you are done.
Why not simply use a LiveCD or DVD of your favourite Linux Distro and install Electrum there? Then export the MPK to a USB thumb drive.
This saves you time and money and is just as secure.
If you really are confident to be able to memorize the seed, then go for it. Initially I would write the seed down though. You can burn the paper later on, when you are more confident you'll recall the seed. Also, look into Shamirs Secret Sharing Scheme to secure the seed. It's the Ubuntu/Debian package ssss.

My god... lately there are so many pendants and nitpickers in this sub, it's unbearable.
Here's to the point, what I was trying to communicate:
* I don't give a shit about who uses which currency and what any of the payment networks in Africa are called, because I don't live there and this is not a Wikipedia Article about African economic history.
* There are payment networks *like* M-Pesa who use SMS technology and are pegged to national currencies
* Some of those currencies are shit, others not as much
* The advantage to bitcoin (via SMS gateways) over *random african currency* (via SMS gateways) is the political invulnerability of bitcoin and it's inherent inter-nationality
* this can have economic advantages over payment networks who are politically vulnerable and are difficult to trade internationally
* this advantages can lead to more economic growth
* this economic growth can lead to a more widespread adoption of smartphones
* the more widespread adoption of smartphones can lead to a more widespread adoption of bitcoin
* this in turn can lead to more economic growth
* now we've got great positive feedback loop going on and we all profit from it
Now you can circle jerk about the right nomenclature of the different payment networks and currencies again if you want and if it makes you feel important. But this is besides the point.

The creation of bitcoins is supposed to be resource intensive. That's the whole point of proof-of-work. This mechanism mimics gold in the sense, that the more gold is mined, the harder it is to get the remaining gold, because naturally, the easiest mined gold is mined in the beginning.
The really cool thing about bitcoin mining compared to gold mining is, that the hardness of the mining process dynamically adjusts to the amount of work put into mining. This means, no matter how fast the miners perform their work, the mining process still takes the same amount of time per bitcoin. This means, that the production of bitcoins is deterministic, everybody can calculate what amount of bitcoins will be mined at which point in time. The positive effect of faster miners is a more secure network, because it is ever more cost intensive to overpower the fast miners with even faster miners.
The more bitcoin is worth, the more people will invest in mining hardware and energy, but due to the nature of the dynamically adjusted difficulty of the mining process, the profit margin is always rather small. The financial incentive to secure the network grows with the value of bitcoin. It will always be more economical to use mining power to secure the network instead of attacking it.

The goal is not to *replace* government with anything, but to get rid of it. What you want is to have other parties than government do some of the jobs governments claim for themselves, like providing security, enforcement of contracts, education, health care etc. All of those things are good, most people want and need them so as long as there are people, people will provide these services, no matter if there's a government or not.
Genocide, war, incarceration or even murder of people guilty of victim-less crimes like drug use or homosexuality, theft, propaganda and indoctrination, etc are for sure things you don't want replaced, but just gone.
The power and opportunity that comes with peer-to-peer systems is, that you can provide the good services on a voluntary basis (not forced via governments monopoly on violence) which means, nobody will "buy" the genocide, for example.
An example: You can have a p2p money system, because money is a very effective tool for trade, but you don't have to subject yourself to government fiat money that can be printed at will and you can avoid taxes, both are a necessity for war.

If you use standalone wallets, like Mycelium or Breadwallet on a smartphone, or Electrum on a computer, you don't need to sign up with an e-mail address and password. You simply create a wallet which contains private keys, nothing but random numbers really, and the corresponding public addresses.

Strawman argument. I never said that ALL of security through obscurity is weaker than ALL open security. Clearly, encrypting stuff with caeser shift cipher is open, but also practically plaintext.
BUT, open, peer reviewed, tested, math based security *is always* better than security through obscurity. It's ok to add obscurity layers on top of proven security, but relying on obscurity is just asking for trouble.

This use-case *screams* for an offline-installation of [Electrum](
I made a chart to explain it once to a friend. It's in German, but you'll probably understand what is meant anyway: 
In short:
* you have infinite cold keys on your offline computer, all derived from an initial 128-bits random number, the seed.
* You can manage your funds from your online computer, without the ability to spend them and thus not having to worry about them getting stolen
* If you want to spend them, you transfer unsigned and then signed transactions via USB stick between the offline and online installation, which never exposes your private keys and takes care of putting your excess funds into a new, unused, cold address automatically.
You don't need a second computer to do that. I installed [Lubuntu]( encrypted to an external hard drive.
To backup your funds, I recommend
* 1: writing the 12 word seed on a piece of paper and storing it securely
* 2: memorizing the 12 word seed
* 3: testing if you memorized it by telling it to yourself once a day or so, typing it in on the offline machine to see if it regenerated the same addresses.
* 4: creating a [2-of-3 Schamirs Secret Sharing Scheme-Split]( printing out the parts and storing them securely, for example one on your person, one in your safe and one at your grandmas house.
* 5: once you are confident that you've memorized the seed and that the SSSS-backup can be reconstructed, destroy the paper from number 2.

Ok, so you are storing your seed in a dictionary? How? You have to mark the words used and their order in the book. If you hand me your dictionary, I'll notice sooner or later whatever form of markings you used and will be able to extract the seed. So, how would you store a 12 word seed in a dictionary?
Having a key space, or rather, address-space of 2^160 and thus rendering brute forcing futile is only one aspect of bitcoins security. Having a large address space is worth nothing, if the hash function to produce the address would be weak and reversible. The hash functions used in bitcoin are cryptographically secure to our best knowledge, the key and address space is large enough to not be brute forcable, the version of ECDSA used in bitcoin is secure, so nothing obscure about it.

This is kind of an apples and oranges comparison, imo. With bank notes, everybody has the same note and they have some sort of "copy protection" built into them. With paper wallets, everybody can print anything, there is nothing that will look familiar to you between two different customers buying at your shop.
Regarding your second point: I don't know what the market will bring forward. Maybe prepaid shopping cards will be a thing, where you load some bits onto, you get a discount and you can pay instantly. Or every item has its own address and you pay while you are going around in super market, which confirms the first items which may be strategically placed by the super market to be the rather expensive ones. Maybe the supermarkets will just absorb the loss from zero-confirmation double spends, just like they do from chargebacks now.

The 12 words is a mnemonic encoding of a 128-bits random number of which all the private keys and corresponding address can be derived deterministically. That means, that the same 128-bits number produces the same keys/addresses.

You won't lose the words. Write them on two pieces of paper, put each in an envelope and store them on two separate places. For example, one with your birth certificate and one with old photos of you as a baby at your parents house. If you managed to keep those pieces of paper secure for decades (I don't know how old you are), then you can do it for those two envelopes too. For even more security, you can split it into *n* shares of which any *m* shares reconstruct the whole and any *p* shares, for *p &lt; m* won't reveal anything. For example, you can split it up into 3 shares and any 2 reconstruct the whole. Then you can store one share at your place, one at your parents and one in your car. [PassGuardian]( can do that. Just try it out, you'll see it's very easy.

Disclaimer: I don't run anything that operates on donations. These are only my thoughts and what might be a good idea.
I haven't done any research, but from previous posts like this, I gather, that the Bitcoin WordPress plugins are not super mature yet.
What you could do, in my view, are two things.
First, you could just put the same Bitcoin address at the bottom, or top, or the homepage of your blog and ask for donations. Seans Outpost does it like that, Freedomain Radio as well. The benefit is, that people can bookmark your address and donate whenever they feel generous. Also, it might be easier to make it transparent for your donors, because the can see how much you've got, what you withdraw and so on.
The second approach is to make an individual address for every article. That way, you can make some stats which topics bring what revenue.
In any case, I would set up the address/private key pairs on an offline computer, making it cold storage. You'll never want this to be compromised.
I would buy a large, USB 3 thumb drive, or an external harddrive with USB 3 or eSATA and install some Linux on it. Then install Electrum on that offline installation and import the master public key into an online installation of Electrum. In Electrum, you can label each address, so you could paste the link to the article, or the headline in that field to keep track of what article make which amount of money.
Edit: Or a third way. A combination of both. The first Electrum address could be your permanent donation address and from there on, you have individual address for individual articles.
In every case: Make the bitcoin address copy-paste-able, use the correct URI and supply a QR-Code. I hate it, when there's only a QR-code.

So the bitcoins I'm selling have to be stored at the address associated with the trading account, right? Otherwise, how do you know that a transaction is related to a trade? If I'm the seller, I can meet with the buyer, cancel the trade and then send from another address, maybe even another app.
What if I send from the trader-account-address, but the transaction is not related to a trade via mycelium? Is it save, meaning no 0.2% fee, to use the trader-account-address for normal stuff, or is more like a dedicated address?

Buy a cheap Android Smart Phone, maybe second hand. Maybe someone just gives you his or her old phone. Or tablet for that matter. Either is ok.
Then do these steps. If they scare you, you might want to go back to 1990 and live on dial up.
* 1: Do a factory reset.
* 2: Install [Wallet32]( and set it up
* 3: write down the 12 word seed and put that paper where your birth certificate and other important documents are.
Then act like this:
* 1: Don't install anything else on that phone/tablet. Just leave it alone!
* 2: Only connect to the internet via your home wifi and only do so, when you want to send some of your coins to your actual spending wallet, which may be on your iPhone 5s or Samsung Galaxy 5 or whatever.
This is not *cold storage grade* secure, but I would be very, VERY surprised if anyone ever lost coins with this strategy.

A bitcoin doesn't really exist. The balance you see associated with an address is simply the aggregate of all incoming and outgoing transactions to and from that address. The transactions themselves contain so called "satoshis".

I said those are logically consistent basic assumptions, lets call them axioms. In now way do they compose a full legal framework for all sorts of dispute resolution. The cases you name are interesting and I don't think that to all of them conclusive answers can be found. This is the reason why contracts and laws exist and why there is a market demand for arbitration. But in no way do cases, in which lawful truth is harder to find, negate the validity of both the non aggression principle and property rights.
It's an all too common way of thinking, that *well, I can't think of a solution for problem X, therefore government*. It's kind of like *well, I can't explain natural phenomenon, therefor god*. I'm sorry, but first you have to show that the non aggression principle and property rights are false.

The host OS has full control over the virtual machines. So you gain no security, if the host OS is not secure. A key logger on the host OS can also log the key strokes that end up in the wallet app running in a VM, some malware scanning the RAM for occurrences of a random string starting with 5, K or L (private keys) can do so just as easily when the wallet runs on the host, as it can when it runs in the VM.
The only way I can see having improved security by employing virtualization is having a very robust and minimal host OS. Like a Debian stable with only the minimal requirements of software running in it. No additional services like a SSH-server, an rsync server, printer server, etc. Base OS + X11, that's it. Fewer services and fewer software means fewer bugs.
And then have one VM for daily usage, like web surfing, work and so on, and an additional VM for the wallet related activities.
Additionally, the web surfing, crap-ware loaded VM could be reset to a snapshot point every time it is shut down.
Also, having different OSes in different VMs can mitigate riscs, because one and the same exploit may not work on all VMs. So having the web surfing machine that gets set back to a snapshot every reboot could be Windows 7, while the wallet VM could be FreeBSD and the host OS is Debian.
All that being said, I believe the better solution for wallet security is having cold storage wallets, either paper or an offline installation of Electrum, and a spending wallet with the smallest amount possible. Having that spending wallet on an Android or iOS device should also add some security. Yes, we know those OSes have flaws too, but they are nothing compared to a standard Windows installation where the last services packs, which don't fix 3 zero-days anyway, haven't been installed, because no one bothers, because it takes an hour and who cares, I just want to surf facebook real quick.

This is the point. Comparing zero risk deflation based cash savings to risky investments is apples and oranges. I'm comparing zero risk in an inflationary monetary system to zero risk in a deflationary and as it turns out, I have higher value over time in an deflationary system.
The inflationary monetary system sort of forces people to invest, because if they don't they lose (too much) value of their holdings.
Your assumption that every one else in the economy will invest in high or medium risk opportunities is only that, an assumption. And as you said, in an deflationary system, nobody's forbidding me to invest in risky operations. But I don't *have to* in order to evade loss of value.
I think we made our points clear. I don't think I will ever understand your point of view, and I can't figure out, why you wouldn't want the option of just holding onto cash and not losing value, *in addition* to being able to make investments.
In the end, the people will decide, because thanks to bitcoin, finally the people can escape the fiat money system that is imposed on them by force.

Generally: no, there is no other way.
The only chance you have is to create another transaction with the same inputs but with a substantially larger miner fee and the recipient being yourself. This gives you a higher probability of the second transaction being included into the next block and the first, wrong transaction being dismissed as a double spend attempt. That's the theory. I don't know  how well it works it practice.

The second... Well, what ever happened to d-wave? Has anyone of you a quantum computer in the basement? I don't.
Anyway, if it's true, that simply means a difficulty increase in mining, kind of like going from CPU to GPU to ASIC. If those computers are targeted at the personal computer market, that could restart the CPU, GPU, ASIC-cycle and bring more decentralization of mining with it.

Lets try to match the map with the territory then.
Imagine NASA tried to put a man on the moon using solely euclidean geometry in R² and pre-Newtonian physics. They launch one rocket after another only to see it crash and burn and killing crew after crew and many innocent bystanders, wondering what went wrong.
They work and think and figure out how to do calculation in R³ and their physics get better. They still crash and burn the rockets together with the crew, but at least the wrecks land, just as predicted according to their now better theoretical framework, in uninhabited wasteland.
After many more tests and research, they figure out all the necessary physical principles and mathematical frameworks and finally bring a man to the moon.
Are we *sure* that the physics and math are correct? Well, they sure are better than before, because the goal, getting to the moon got closer and closer and was finally achieved. But are the whole? Probably not, because they won't explain why the radio signals take a second to transmit to earth.
Now back to social rules. If you look at the different countries, you'll notice one tendency: All other things being equal, a greater adherence to the non aggression principle and property rights brings greater wealth and prosperity. The laws of the countries today are kind of where the above NASA-story was, when they finally made a rocket that halfway took off. Sometimes they get worse, sometimes they get better again. But anybody would find it hard to argue, that life in countries that respect the individual more is better, than life in countries than respect the individual less.
The NAP and property rights are logically consistent, I think I kind of showed that in another post, if not, there are smarter people with more time on their hands than me, who did.
Is that a guarantee that the NAP and property rights are *correct* in the sense, that they bring equality before the law, justice, wealth and prosperity? It's not a guarantee, but everything else crashes and burns violently and everything that comes closer to NAP and property kicks ass.

Don't confuse wallet with address. A wallet contains one or more address/key pairs. Wallet software, such as Electrum, Armory, Bitcoin-QT send the change to a new, unused address of its own.
A paper wallet is the edge case of being a wallet with only one address/key pair. This is the reason why you should always empty the whole paper wallet into a software walled of yours, do what you have to do and then send the remainder to a new unused paper wallet. After that archive the used paper wallet in case you accidentally send funds to it again.

The profit margin of mining is always very small, because the hash rate needed to mine adjusts dynamically to the overall hashing power of the network. That means, if one Bitcoin is worth one USD and mining a block will reward you with 25 bitcoins, over time miners will tend to use just shy of 25 USD of electricity and computing equipment per block. The higher the price per bitcoin, the more you can invest and still make a profit.
The cool thing about this is, with a rising price per bitcoin, the hash rate increases and makes the network more secure. More secure because an attack would be of a higher price to the attacker. If the price per bitcoin falls, so does the hashing power, but also the incentive to attack the network falls.
Imagine the two points on a spectrum. The left point is where the bitcoin network is used by two people only. It is very easy for one of them to overpower the other and take control over the network. A cheap GPU upgrade will make you the winner. But will you buy a 300 USD GPU just to mess with your buddy over some digital tokens nobody else uses anyway? It's not a high investment to attack that network, but it's still very expensive, because you gain nothing from the attack.
The right point is the network when bitcoin is the world reserve currency, having a value of lets say one bitcoin being the equivalent of a tenth of the GDP of a medium sized European country. Now controlling the network would be of much greater advantage for an attacker, but would need unbelievable amounts of capital to even attempt it and even then, if he succeeds, a simple patch can make his mining hardware obsolete after the first block that he mines and everybody on the planet who has meat in this game, which is everybody on the planet at this point in time, goes "wtf was that?"

Super secure. If you're really confident you'll never forget that password, you'll be fine.
In case you want to secure the password as well, you can split it into *n* shares of which any *m* will reconstruct it, but any *k &lt; m* won't reveal any information.
For example, splitting it into 3 parts of which any 2 can reconstruct it. Then have one part in your (physical) wallet, one at home and one with your family.
[PassGuardian]( can do that and it runs offline too, of course.

Then let me say it in another way: you have to have a backup of every private key to which address you want to send bitcoins to.
You backup a paper wallet by printing it out twice, or having a digital backup on an USB drive. You test the paper wallet by double and triple checking, if the private key you've got there printed onto paper really produces the address you want to send the bitcoins to. There's no need to go online for that. Just use the "Wallet details" tab from bitaddress.org.

They send you like one cent or so. I don't know exactly why, but I guess to make sure you are the owner of that bank account. The code is sent along with the transaction of that one cent. I can't remember how long it took, but I think it wasn't long, like 2 days. The banking system really is the bottle neck here.
BTW: forget Monday. The verification transaction will take at least until Monday, because banks don't work on weekends. Then you can buy from the marketplace and usually this transaction takes a day or two too, since the Euro transfer is from your bank account directly to the sellers. So forget bitcoin.de for Monday. If you so desperately need bitcoins, you could find a bitcoin atm, localbitcoins.com or Mycelium local trader.

**Investment Strategy**
I wrote down in an Excel sheet every purchase of bitcoins I ever made and in retrospective I would have been better off if I had bought 100 Euros worth of bitcoins every time I bought. In other words: don't try to anticipate if the price is going up or down in the near future. Like if you feel that 240 Euros is low, buy much, if you think it's high, buy only a little. Who says that in a week the price won't bubble to 2500 Euros or that it won't fall to 100 over the next 6 months? If you buy periodically you average out price fluctuations. In my particular case this means, that by buying sometimes for large amounts of Euros and sometimes for low amounts, my average price per bitcoin is now 232 Euros. Had I bought periodically for 100 Euros it would be 160 Euros per bitcoin.
So if you want to invest 1200 USD, I would split it up into 12 payments of 100 USD and then buy twice a month or once a month.
You definitely need some method of cold storage if you want to hold bitcoins long term.  "Cold storage" only means, that the private key from which the bitcoin address was derived, never touches a device that is connected to the internet.
I recommend Electrum as a cold storage wallet. I wrote a step by step how to [here](
Alternatively you can also just print out paper wallets from some sort of live medium. To do that, I recommend the following steps:
* 1: Get two USB thumb drives, one of which has at least 2 to 4 GB
* 2: Install Unetbootin. If you use Mac OS or Windows, go to  if you use Linux use your package manager.
* 3: Download [Linux Mint](
* 4: Make a bootable live USB drive using Unetbootin and the Linux Mint image you just downloaded
* 5: Download the [Bitaddress.org ZIP]( and save it to the second USB drive
* 6: Disconnect your computer from all network cables and boot from the Linux Mint Live USB drive
* 7: Connect the second USB thumb drive, extract the contents of the ZIP archive and create paper wallets
* 8: Print them out. Also think about a backup strategy, like printing them out twice, password protected and storing the copies on different locations, or also doing a split like in the Electrum tutorial from above.

It's a fact that in the absence of patents, a monopoly on a certain technology granted by the coercive force of the state, prices of new technology drop faster, profit margins are smaller and first movers have not as large of a window of opportunity to sell the product at very large profit.
So what?
There are many aspects of the economy that are not "protect-able" with patents or any other form of so called *intellectual property*. For example it's not possible to patent or copyright fashion or food. Also software is mostly unpatentable.
This only means, that those areas of the economy have a much faster pace of innovation, which in turn is an advantage for the consumer.
The trezor guys might be the producers of the trezor, *one* product, but they profit as a consumer from faster innovation themselves with every other product they don't produce. Including the capital goods they employed for manufacturing the trezor, whatever it is, if only their PCs.
What can people do? It's easy really. If you have to compete, compete. Lower your price, up the game, make it yet better, offer better service, whatever it takes. And if turns out the business model is unsustainable, then there's nothing wrong with going out of business. Many do. Just look how many of the Fortune 500 companies from the last 100 years are around today. Nobody dies, people just do other things.

The argument of the correlation of the price to attack and the value (=threat to the government in your example) of the network applies too, I think. Right now the US, Chinese, Russian or really any other government of big enough countries or productive enough people could pull off such a sabotage. Spend a billion and you could easily disturb the network with 51% attacks, malicious miners and nodes etc. And a billion is not that much for those governments. But right now, spending a billion USD to attack this, in their perception, nerd-money-ponzi-scheme is like the guy who thinks about buying a 300 USD GPU to overpower his buddy, the only other guy in the network. It makes no sense at all to do that. And at the point where the nerd-money-ponzi-scheme is actually absorbing the monetary base of country after country, it's not a billion USD to attack it anymore.
And again: Even if you attack it, even if you don't care if you make a loss attacking it because it saves your fiat-money-fraud-system. So what? If you invest a billion USD in ASIC miners who do sha256 very fast and the rest of the network is threatened by you, the next version of bitcoin uses sha256 of the Whirlpool hash and suddenly the billion dollar ASIC farm is nothing more than an expensive electrical heater. Will the network take a blow? Sure. Will it be destroyed? No.

And why is that a problem? All he can do is cause some volatility, that's something bitcoiners are used to anyway.
The way I see it is kind of the same like with the Silk Road auctions: It's a good thing they are sold, because that means that after the transaction, they are in the hands of people who want them more and are thus more likely to be pro-bitcoin.
The same goes for Satoshis coins. Even *if* this all was a plot to.. I don't even know what the goal of that plot would be, and he's an Orwellian NSA-agent, so what? If he sells his coins for a cent each, guess what? I'm going to buy the shit out of 'em. If he doesn't, even better.
What people don't get, I think is, that in an open, peer-to-peer system, not even the inventor has more power than anybody else. Yes, he has more coins, but that is no more power than any billionaire has. Imagine the pump-and-dumps a Russian oligarch could pull off. Or some Wall Street asshole who sees his primary income source threatened.
I believe, that the enemies of bitcoin don't dare to try to attack it in such a way, because if they fail, and they will, it will strengthen the network even more. Like: "See all that oil money going in there? They tried to out-volatile the bitcoin community. All they did is helping some nerds get Lamborghinis."

Actually memorizing it works for me. I say the seed to my self in my head at least once a day and from time to time I try it out on one of my offline installations.

Privately owned land that a firm intentionally pollutes, is called a garbage dump and is a legitimate use of land. The question is, is it the most productive use for that land? If it's not, firms won't use it, or if they do, they go bankrupt because their competition actually uses land more productive.
What is hard and what is easy is a matter of incentives, like tracking garbage, keeping garbage from traveling onto certain water areas, and so on.
Water is dynamic, so is air. Doesn't really matter. Prior to WW1, you actually could sue firms for polluting the air, if you could prove you're negatively impacted, for example if your laundry that you hung in the garden to dry got dirty from the factory's air pollution. You could sue and win those cases and the firm was forced to stop polluting the air. Then WW1 came and suddenly private property wasn't important anymore, but "the greater good", which was winning the war and producing tanks in the factory was "for the greater good" and overruled your property right in your garden and the air in it.
This is just an example, of how perverted the law is and with actual respect for private property and it's enforcement, many seemingly impossible tasks, like keeping large bodies of water clean, aren't actually that hard.

~~Okay, then let me rephrase: the price is so low, that the mining power that switches to mining Bcash is negligible.~~
That's actually not what I said. I said: "the price of Bcash is so low, that it's never more profitable to mine it compared to mining Bitcoin." That doesn't mean that *nobody* mines Bcash. It only means, that whoever mines Bcash for whatever reason, doesn't switch between it and Bitcoin periodically. A constant percentage of miners, say 80% mine Bitcoin, the other 20% mine Bcash. Although it would surprise me if this happens, because why would anybody mine Bcash, if the profit is lower (although positive) than when mining Bitcoin?


Your guess is as good as mine. I can only speak for myself: I prefer a blockchain that works 100% of the time at a higher cost per transaction, than a blockchain that sort of works for 30% of the time for cheaper transactions. It's just preference of stability over short term expenses. **EDIT:** Also Bcash literally brings nothing to the table, that Litecoin wouldn't too. So if very low transaction fees would be a priority to me over stability and "buy and forget years, if not decades" character of Bitcoin, I'd use Litecoin.

If a week from now, the price of Bitcoin is $6000, your 0.4655 BTC are worth $2793. If the price has fallen in the meantime to say $3000, your 0.4655 BTC are worth $1396.50.

That's wrong. Your patch of ocean is surrounded by the patches of ocean by other people. If you dump garbage on your patch and it washes into the property of your neighbors, you'll get sued, have to pay for the cleanup, have to pay a fine and you'll get probabtion. Now it's *not* prudent from a profit oriented view, to dump garbage into your patch of ocean. *Unless* you can guarantee, it doesn't wash into other peoples property, at which point we are at the aqua-garbage dump-case again, which is with that restriction, just as legitimate as a land-garbage dump. But my feeling is, that won't happen, because securing land is easier.

They didn't and they still don't do, but private property has been eroded, so you can't sue them anymore, for polluting your laundry.

Exchanges are the cheapest way to buy bitcoin. Coinbase is sort of expensive, but they have an exchange backend called GDAX where the fees are substantially lower, like 0.25%. Or you can register with other exchanges like Kraken.com and Bitstamp.net, who also have a fee of about 0.25%.

Bitmain could mine with ASICboost Bitcoin until August 8th. Then SegWit activates.
Either they accept to not being able to use ASICboost anymore, or they exclusively mine Bcash.
If they choose the former, that would probably mean instant death to Bcash, since not even its creators want to use it, which very well could be the case, if mining valuable Bitcoin is more profitable than mining worthless Bcash, even with ASICboost.
If they choose the latter, it would also mean instant death to Bcash, because nobody's going to swim in the "one guy only has ASICboost"-shark tank with Bitmain, when they might as well mine Bitcoin and face fair, ASICboost-disabled, competition.

We are, by having a fixed block size. Imagine a dynamically, arbitrary block size. An attacker could spam a block to arbitrary size, say 200MB, costing him almost nothing but burdening every node to store that 200MB of trash forever.
A fee market is like real world self defense. It is expensive to maintain a military, it is expensive to own and carry guns and to train with them, but the alternative is someone else is imposing his will on you. In the case of a blockchain, that will may be to get control out of the users hands and centralize it to a few mining and server farms.

You forgot to mention another mistake: Don't invent your own crypto. Like, "I've got it! I'm going to store half of the seed here and half of the seed there."
How much entropy is in 6 of the 12 words, which are also in the right order? My back of the envelope calculation says that's about 2^(64) bits of entropy. That's not a lot.
Because most people absolutely suck at digital security, these 12 word seed phrases are a godsend. People are relatively good with *physical* security and keeping a piece of paper secure is relatively easy for most.
Also, don't use your PC with a million services (file, printer, "firewall",...) running, all with remote exploitable holes, as your wallet device. Those are Windows screenshots...

This video is in my opinion hands down the best explanation of how bitcoin works under the hood:
To get started owning bitcoin, there really isn't much to it. Because this question is asked often nowadays, I copy-paste my answer like this:
Hope that helps.

1: Yes, software wallets on Internet-connected devices (hot devices) are less secure than hardware wallets like [Trezor]( But when they are on a secure smartdevice (smartphone, tablet) running Android or iOS, they are pretty secure.
2: Although there are mutli-coin wallets, I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket. To store other cryptocoins than Bitcoin, you can check out Coinomi or Jaxx, but at least to me, they are highly suspicious. I would segregate them from my bitcoin wallet. On Android, I think Mycelium is the best bitcoin-wallet. So if you must hold other coins (which I think is a mistake), use Coinomi for them and a separate wallet, like Mycelium for Bitcoin.
3: Das ist ja wohl der größte Blödsinn, den ich je gelesen hab. Die machen dir da nur ein Paper Wallet. Dabei kann ich dir auch helfen und keiner außer dir, wird davon den Private Key jemals sehen.
4: To sell within the banking system, you generally have to register with an exchange, jump through all the regulatory hoops and then you can transfer your bitcoins using your wallet to the exchange, sell them and withdraw Euros to your bank account. Of course there also other ways, like buying physical gold at vaultoro.com or goldmoney.com, having it delivered to you and selling it for Euros. Or getting a Xapo.com debit card that can be loaded using bitcoin. Or selling for cash using Localbitcoins.com or Mycelium Local trader. Or going peer-to-peer using Bisq.io.

This is a common misconception about how bitcoin-mining works.


The answer is always *yes*.
In bitcoin-mining, there's something called the difficulty. It's a measure of how hard it is to mine a block. The difficulty adjusts to the amount of hashes that are computed in the bitcoin-network. When more people start mining because the price of bitcoin rises and more money can be made from mining bitcoin, the difficulty rises, making mining harder and pushing down the profit that can be made from mining once again. In equilibrium, a miner would roughly earn slightly more than the general interest rate.
So, if for whatever reason it becomes less profitable to mine bitcoin, some miners will stop mining, the difficulty goes down, requiring fewer resources to mine and the profitability rises again, to a point where new miners see their chance, enter the mining market, the difficulty goes up, pushing profits down, pushing miners out of business again and so on.
If the block-reward and transaction fees are so low that most miners stop mining, I'll do it with my spare android-phone and it will be enough. The difficulty will be very low at this point, but so will the resources I have to invest to earn that little reward that can be mined.

What you are saying actually makes no sense. If you think the current price is too high, then you must think, it will go down in the future. You can earn money in that case, it's called *short selling*.
If you think the price will grow in the future, then why do you care about the current price? All that matters is the relative price increase. So if you put CAD 1000 in now and expect that to be worth CAD 2000 in 12 months, why do you care if the bitcoin-amount behind it is 0.87 or 1.24 or whatever else?
If you think the price is from now on constant, it's still a good idea to buy bitcoin, because if it's as stable as your domestic fiat, you might as well own bitcoin and gain the benefit of it being not subject to bank bail-ins, government confiscation etc.
As you can see, all roads lead to buying bitcoin. Either on a loan to sell short, just buy and hold long, or store your value ;)

The price of the things might very well fluctuate a few percentages up and down. 
Having 1:1 parity with IOU's like Tether doesn't make sense anyway, because by design Tether and its competitors introduce additional points of failure. So having a risk-discount priced in, let's say 5% i.e. 1 USDT = 0.95 USD, would seem more rational to me.

You have to be the only one who holds the keys to your bitcoins. That means, use your own wallet. Don't leave them on an exchange.
Use your smartphone or tablet, not your PC or Mac. For Android, use Mycelium , for iOS breadwallet. Write down that recovery seed on paper and store it with your other important documents.
Over time and with increased experience, you can increase the security of your setup. Creating cold storage paper wallets, or buying a hardware wallet, or a multi-sig setup. 
For now, having a good wallet on a smartdevice is a good starting point.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:28:32
Yes, literally everyone ;) But modern wallets don't require you to do that. If you use something like Electrum, you should encrypt the wallet-file using the built in password feature of Electrum. But you don't have to physically copy the wallet-file somewhere else. Those times are over, thank god.
Modern wallets use one giant random-number, that they display to you as a string of english words, and determenistically derive all the private keys/addresses you need from that one giant number. This number, represented as English words, is called the seed. It is all you have to have. If you want to use the wallet on another device, just install Electrum there and enter the same seed.
So encrypt the wallet locally in case someone steals your computer, but write down the recovery seed on good old paper and physically secure that.
To see this derivation process in action, you can use this website: 
Electrum uses a different derivation process, tough. But the principle is the same.
However: I stronlgy recommend using either Mycelium on Android or Breadwallet on iOS, instead of Electrum on Windows, Mac or Linux. Because smartphone operating systems are inherently more secure, than general purpose computer operating system. If you have an Android *and* an iOS device, I'd prefer the iOS device over the Android.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:06:42
Steve Gibson and [Intel]( disagree with you. Length beats complexity.
You have to take into consideration, how password cracking works. In the video you've linked, it's explained pretty good.
You start with the lowest hanging fruit, dictionary words. `furnace` is in there. If that was the password, we're screwed.
Then you try trivial substitutions, like 3 for an e, lower- and upper-case switching. `fUrnac3` is in there, so if that was the password, now we're screwed. But it's not, so the attacker still doesn't *anything* about our password. He only knows it's longer than 7 characters.
Maybe he applies some more rule sets like shown in the video. Sure, maybe putting ten dots in front and after a "Tier 2" password is in there. Then we're screwed. But I used this example deliberately, like Gibson does on his homepage (`D0g.....................`),  to not give away information of how maybe I lengthen my passwords.
If our way to lengthen the password isn't in the rule set, and it probably isn't, if you came up with your own way to lengthen it, then there's only one strategy left to crack it: brute force. And with a character set of `[A-Z, a-z, 0-9] + special characters = 93 symbols`, going through all 26 character long passwords with 40 billion hashes per second (like the guy in the video), takes about `1201406740248028775725628286049913 years`. (`93^26 / (40*10^9) / 60 / 60 / 24 / 365`.
And he still didn't find it, because our password is 27 characters long.

That's as low as it gets. The only alternative to importing a private key is sweeping, which is a transaction itself.
So in Mycelium the process is:
* PW -&gt; Mycelium = 0 tx
* Mycelium -&gt; Recipient = 1 tx
* Mycelium remaining BTC-&gt; New PW = 1 tx
* **Total: 2 tx**
In wallets that sweep, like Coinomi or breadwallet, it's:

Bitcoin is sort of under attack right now. Hashing power is oscillating between it and Bcash, pushing block times to about 2-3 blocks an hour (instead of 6). Add to that suspiciously many low-fee transactions clogging up the mempool... yeah,.. there's something's going on.

Here's a workable solution:
Use two password managers. Let the password manager create your passwords that are super secure, like 16 to 20 characters long, with the largest possible character set (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, a few symbols).
Use the Lastpass browser plugin for things that are basically irrelevant. Like social media accounts, forum accounts, and so on. Not that Lastpass is insecure, but it's a browser plugin, so.. meh.
User another passwordmanager, I recommend KeePassX (Linux, MacOS) or KeePass (Windows). Store here all the stuff that matters, like e-banking, bitcoin-exchanges, online shopping, Netflix, and everything else that contains banking and credit card information. That you will have to backup manually. If your password is secure enough (see below), you can simply put it into your Dropbox folder. Or you manually copy it to USB-thumb drive, versioned would be even better, like `2017-08-12-keepass-db.kdbx`, next week `2017-08-19-keepass-db.kdbx` and so on.
All you have to do, is create and remember *one secure password*. That's going to be your KeePass/KeePassX password. It will be used to encrypt all your other passwords. If you want/can remember a second secure password, use that for Lastpass. If not, simply store the Lastpass password in KeePass.
Now, how do you get a secure password? [Password Haystacks]( Read that, watch Steve Gibsons episode of SecurityNow on the topic, or simply take my word for it.
Here's an example: I just picked a random book from my bookshelf and picked the word `furnace` from it. `furnace` isn't a good password, but you can hide that bad password in a haystack of other stuff, which makes it a very good password. Like this: `..........fUrnac3..........`. This password is 27 characters long, it contains symbols, lower letter, upper case letters and numbers. It's practically impossible to crack, it can be remembered relatively easy and it can be typed in relatively easy.
For the bitcoin wallets, keys, seeds and so on: Only expose that stuff to smartphones/tablets or ideally, offline systems, like Linux Live USBs/DVDs or hardware wallets. To back them up, use paper. Plain and simple.
Edit: Regarding 2-FA: Whenever possible, enable 2-FA. Here are a few things to consider. If the 2-FA app that's used is Authy, disable multiple-device support. If it's Google Authenticator print out the setup-site that displays the QR code and store it with your documents. If the website offers both, Authy and Google Authenticator, use Google Authenticator.

Don't be naive. They don't hold your money. They lend it out. Nobody ever gave you a free bank account. The bank lends out your money and earns interest on it. Some of that is used to pay for the bank account and some of it to keep the bank operational like any other business.
If the interest rates are so low due to permanently inflating the money supply, this doesn't work anymore.
Anyway, if this happens, I'm going to be 100% in bitcoin and gold. Maybe even more than 100% (i.e. taking out a loan in fiat).
In a sense, we have been at negative interest rates for a long time. The interest you get for the money in your bank account hasn't compensated for inflation in decades.

The ratio between nodes that accept BCH blocks and nodes that refuse non-SegWit-blocks (i.e. BIP148), is at least 1:15 in favor of BIP148-nodes.

Store the information you need in many places, but in a way, that the compromise of one location doesn't endanger the information.
Because this can be rather tedious to set up, I wouldn't store just one private key, but rather a source of entropy to create infinite private keys from. For example a [BIP39 mnemonic seed]( or a [DiceWare passhrase](
Then you can split the seed/passphrase into a [M-of-N-SSSS]( for example 2-of-3.
Or simply encrypt it and have multiple copies of encrypted seed/passphrase in different locations and the password remembered and backed up in another location, different from the locations of the encrypted seed/passphrase itself.
To encrypt arbitrary data you can use `gpg` and use the ASCII-armor option, which allows you to print out the encrypted data. This is a good fallback option, in case your digital copies on USB thumb drives, CD-ROMs, harddrives etc fail. Here is an example of an encrypted 12 word seed and what it would look like, if you printed it out:

Why a hardware wallet in such an early phase, considering the initial monetary investment you'd have to make?
If they are actually interested in sending bitcoins back and forth, you could initially use Dogecoins. You could buy $10 worth of Dogecoins and get them started with that. Sending 10 Doge is like $0.15 or so, they learn how to scan QR codes, how addresses work, how to secure a seed, and so on and there's almost no risk involved.
For iOS, there's a Doge wallet that's practically the same as breadwallet, at least from the looks of it, I haven't used it: 
For Android, you can simply use Coinomi, which also has the ability to host Bitcoins (and other cryptocoins) too for the real deal later on.

Because denying it can be done, is you pretending to have thought through all possible scenarios and being able to demonstrate, that each one encounters an impossibility. This presumes not only your omniscience on how many possible scenarios exist, but also your ability to simulate them through.
I make no such claim. Instead of claiming 1) to know the number of possible scenarios and 2) to know the outcome of each of them, I only claim that I *don't* know how many ways there are to solve this problem, that I and nobody else can predict the outcome conclusively and that there might be one solution.

@_date: 2017-08-31 15:31:59


Yea, that's a potential risk.


How do you make your paper wallets? What tool are you using?


A trezor would be better, because the keys never leave the device and the seed is backed up on paper. You are substituting IT security for physical security, which 99.999% of the population are orders of magnitude better at.
Also, receiving and sending with a Trezor is easier. It's bascially like a normal wallet running from your browser or smartphone, only the keys are on this extra device.


It doesn't really matter if the company exists or not. The key derivation process is an open standard. If the company goes under, you just install a compatible wallet on your phone, type in the recovery seed there. Then send to a new hardware wallet or whatever is available then.


Well... it could happen. A somewhat targeted attack on you might be successful, because the system you create the private keys on is online from time to time.


Remote attacks, like malware, would have to target you by switching addresses in the systems memory. So that virus would have to wait for bitcoin-addresses in your memory and switch them for addresses of the owner of that virus so you send bitcoins not to your address, but to the attackers'. Trezor also shows the address on the display, so if you double check it, you're fine.
The main problem with hardware wallets is physical security.

Under normal circumstances, you'd have a throughput of 1MB of blockspace every 10 minutes which can be stuffed with transactions. Because that's an average number, lets make it 6 MB per hour, or 60MB per 10 hours, etc. (the higher the time frame you're looking at, the closer it gets to the ideal of 1MB per 10 minutes).
Unfortunaltey, miners are currenlty switching between mining Bitcoin and Bcash (aka Bitcoin Cash), depending on how much they can earn visa-vi the relative difficulty mining Bitcoin and the relative difficulty mining Bcash. 
The price of Bcash is lower than that of Bitcoin, but if the difficulty mining it is significanlty smaller than the diffictuly of mining Bitcoin, it will be mined nontheless, because it yields a higher profit.
Once miners switch over mining Bcash, its difficulty will rise to a point, where it's again more profitable to mine Bitcoin and miners will switch back to Bitcoin.
This leads to larger times between blocks during the periods in which it is more profitable to mine Bcash, averaging out to 2 to 3MB per hour, instead of the ideally 6MB.
The good thing is, while this osscillation of difficulty and blocktimes is an inconvenience for Bitcoin, it completely screws Bcash. On Bitcoin, it leads to higher transaction fees, but the network functions. In Bcash, it practically halts the network for hours on end.
The prediction is, that this fact pushes the price for Bcash down so low, that it never is more profitable to mine it compared to mining Bitcoin, the oscillations stop and we're back at the 6MB per hour ideal throughput of transaction data.

We're running in circles here. 
I fully agree with what you wrote there. But answer me this: why would the merchant keep money in btc, without expecting it to be a *superior* store of value compared to fiat?


Now you're conflating two different types of demand. Transactual demand and demand as store of value. One doesn't beget the other.


Again, conflating two demands. Out-compete in what? Merchants excepting it? Good luck convincing merchants to except bitcoin, much less keeping a portion of their earnings in it, if it doesn't hold value. And why does it hold value? Because people are not willing to sell at current price, i.e. they hoard.


Still, conflating transactual demand and all other use cases of money (and facilitating transactions isn't even the primary use case for money, as could be argued by looking back at the gold standard). As a long term store of value, bitcoin out-competes everything else. And as a transaction-network, it actually sucks compared to Visa, PayPal, etc.

If you like the convenience of having the automated recurring transactions, why not? The fees are little steep, like 1.5% I think. If you buy manually on GDAX (their exchange, you also have a GDAX account if you have Coinbase account), you'd pay 0.25%.
But having automatic recurring transactions that actually happen is a hell of a lot better than manual cheaper buys that one forgets.

Dude, you're over psycho-analyzing the whole thing. If you want to spend bitcoin, in the hopes to convince someone that it's not a ponzi or whatever, go ahead. Maybe you could one day explain to me, why the merchant you bought from would hold on the bitcoin, if not for an expected increase in value. Because if it stays the same relative to dollar, then what's the point in holding it? That's circular reasoning. You want people to use bitcoin as currency, without it being a store of value. Clearly, that's not possible, because if people spent their bitcoins and merchants didn't want to store their value in it, they would sell for fiat and the price would drop, just like it does when a whale dumps on the market.
You can have a store of value, without it being a currency. You can't have a currency, without being itself a store of value, or being backed by a store of value.

If you spend money, you put it on the market which applies downwards pressure on the price.

Me too. But I don't kick my ass for that. I'm not an altcoin trader. I'm not good or interested in becoming good about anticipating the altcoin-market.
Think about it. If you had 10 BTC and you've got roughly 8.8% for them, you've got an extra 0.88 BTC.
Every day there are opportunities where you could risk 0.88 BTC to trade back and forth between an altcoin in the hopes you time the market right and maybe get 1.6 BTC out. You can do that *right now*, pick any altcoin, could be Dogecoin, doesn't matter, go to any exchange that supports it and try to time the market to earn extra BTC. All that matters is the relative price change between the two. If you really don't feel like doing that, you've made the right decision yesterday.

Nothing is backed by anything tangible. People exchange stuff because they think that what they are getting is worth more than what they are giving up.
If you trade a chicken for a loaf of bread, the loaf of bread is worth more to you than the chicken. That's why you are better of doing the trade. The other guy thinks the same in reverse, win-win situation.
The loaf of bread must have had a utility for you. You wouldn't have traded the chicken for it, if you hadn't some use in mind for it. Most probably you were going to eat it, but you may also wanted to feed pigeons in the park, play soccer with it, study the growth of fungi on it. Or you realized, that bread is more easily traded than chicken, so you might have traded the chicken for the bread, not because you wanted to use the bread directly, but because you expect it to be traded against other stuff.
Bread is more easily traded, because you can divide it more easily. It also doesn't run away like a chicken and so on.
However, soon you and others realize, that other stuff is even more easily traded than bread. Salt for example. Salt is even more divisible and it has the added benefit, that it doesn't spoil over time. But in order to trade it for expensive stuff, say a horse, you have to transport large amounts of it, which makes it inconvenient.
Over time, one thing emerges, which is the most easily traded good on the market and that is then called money. Because of it's physical properties, gold has been the money of choice for thousands of years and only state violence can get people to abandon it for paper money.
But, remember: there is nothing special about gold. It's still just one thing on the market that can be traded against other stuff. It had to have a utility, like the loaf of bread, or else this chain of trades would have never incorporated gold.
Gold isn't backed by anything either, nothing is. Stuff has utility or it doesn't and it's very easily trade-able, or it isn't.
Gold has utility and is easily trade-able.
Bitcoin has utility and is easily trade-able.
I would argue, Bitcoin has even more utility and is even more trade-able. That's what it's backed by. The same "thing" as gold is, only better.
This is the Mises'ian Regression Theorem of Money in a nutshell.

If you absolutely must encrypt your seed digitally, because you are too afraid someone might steal it or it burns down with your house and you're too poor to afford a bank safe deposit box, then at least use open source software specifically written to encrypt data.
On Windows, use [Keepass]( On MacOS and Linux, use [KeepassX](
Also, let Keepass/KeepassX create your password for you and write *that* down on paper, twice, and secure it in two different locations, independent of the encrypted keepass-file. So if someone steals the paper with the password, he can't do anything with it, if he gets his hands on the keepass-file, he can't do anything with it either.
*However*, the risk of a layman, you know, someone who thinks that MS Word is an adequate program to encrypt data, fucking this up somehow, is at least 1 million times larger, than someone breaking into your house and stealing your 12 word seed on a piece of paper with your other documents, instead of the jewelry, prescription medicine and cash.
Edit: A little addendum: Don't use Keepass or KeepassX on your desktop computer. Use [MiniKeePass]( on your iOS device, or [KeepassDroid]( on your Android device. It's the same sort of software, even follow the same standards, but smartphones and tablets are much more secure than standard desktops.

Wrong. You are conflating currency and money. Those are different things when we're talking about non-fiat currencies. Under the gold standard, gold was the money, the store of value and paper certificates were the currency. The paper itself couldn't function as money or currency by itself. See: Regression Theorem by Ludwig von Mises.


You're still not getting it. People have to hold an asset for it to hold or increase value. If people don't hold the asset but get rid of it as soon as possible, the value plummets, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE TOO.


Again, this is factually wrong. 
Anyway, I think this is it for me in this regard. I don't get what your plan is anyway. Go ahead and encourage merchant adoption. I'm not against that. It's just erroneous to think that SELLING an asset, which is what you're doing if you're spending it, you're selling for pizza or whatever, could ever increase its price. This is logically false.

Your money isn't lost. Either the transaction clears, that it's in Exodus, or it gets dropped, than it's still in Mycelium. The bitcoin don't actually leave your wallet.
On a different note: You should switch to a SegWit enabled wallet. Exodus has horrible security, and doesn't support SegWit.
Use a SegWit-enabled wallet for your future bitcoin holdings.

Make sure the address starts with a 3 and not with a 1 to get SegWit. It cuts down on your transaction cost and speeds up transactions.
1: You have to add a SegWit-address manually and write the private key on paper to make a backup.

You have to read up on encryption and probability theory. If you use a cryptographically strong password and an encryption standard like AES256, there is no way anyone can accidentally, or deliberately, get to your wallet. 
For example, if you do the following on an offline, airgapped, computer:
* Create a strong, [haystacked password]( for example `::::::::::n4m3 legal eternal pecan king::::::::::`. ([DiceWare]( Memorize it. Also create a *m-of-n* [SSSS]( for example 2-of-3, and print out the shares.
* Use [WarpWallet]( and type in that password.
* Use the private key that it generates, as the encryption key to your wallet-seed.
* Use [KeePassX]( as the software to encrypt the seed.
* Calculate the SHA256-sum of the encrypted wallet seed and write the sha256sum of it on a piece of paper.
* Store the encrypted seed like you did, at multiple places. Because the file is small, you can copy it 1000 times each to a CD-ROM and to USB thumb drives.
You can, for example, have 2-of-2 SSSS. Have one share in your house and one share on your person. Should you ever forget the passphrase, you can reconstruct it using the shares. If you lose one of the shares, hopefully you can recreate them before forgetting the passphrase. You'd have to lose one share (lost physical wallet, house burns down) AND forget the passphrase at the same time, to lose your money.
If you do something like that and still OCD over someone getting your bitcoins, no amount of crypto can help you, only a psychiatrist might be able to.

SegWit in a sense allows for that, pushing the chain size to a few GB. Such a node would be able to autonomously verify transaction, but couldn't bootstrap the blockchain.

Of course they did. Sooner or later people *have* to spend money. There's nothing wrong with that. That bitcoin is a medium of exchange is clear by now. People hold bitcoin in order to later exchange it for other things. Increasing spending doesn't help it retaining value.


Completely besides the point. The "velocity of money" is a completely meaningless term. See: 
In short: What makes a money more valuable rather than less, is if people spend what they must and hoard the rest. The fact that they actually can spend it means it's actually money (or at least medium of exchange) and hoarding the rest decreases supply and, ceteris paribus thus increases it's purchasing power.

Please read this again. This isn't spending bitcoin. This is using bitcoin as a payment network to transact fiat. If you sell bitcoin for pizza on place A and rebuy bitcoin on place B, you didn't spend bitcoin.


This is an extreme scenario and not one that actually could be reality. Because in order to recoup mining costs, at least that amount of bitcoin has to be sold on the market. As I said, sooner or later money has to be spent, because at the very least we need food. But *encouraging* spending and expecting a price increase for it, is nonsensical Keynesian BS. But this might be besides the point, since you're not actually advocating spending Bitcoin, you're advocating using it as a payment network for fiat.

You can use the Bitcoin Core wallet. Just go to the console and type 
`walletpassphrase "your_passphrase" 500`
then copy that address and type
`dumpprivkey 1thatAddressYouJustCopied`
`addwitnessaddress 1thatAddressYouJustCopied`.
Now you have the address, the witness address and the private key combo. Copy and paste into text file, print out, viola, paper wallet.
If you're doing that on an offline system, you don't have to worry about the synchronization of the blockchain. If you're doing it on an online system and don't want to start synching the blockchain, you can start the client using the argument `-maxconnections=0`. Or simply go offline. It's probably easier, and more secure.

Depending on what you're photographing, I'd say it is a secure source of entropy. Especially if you're not using any compression file-format, like JPG, but the picture actually is a giant matrix of numerical values (interpreted as colors).
For example, if you shuffle a poker card deck (52 cards) very well at least 10 times, the entropy is amazingly high. Spreading the cards out and taking a photo of that has at least the entropy contained in that card deck.
Then shuffle it again 10 times and you've got a great source of entropy.
Using the picture itself as the private key is insecure, tough, because meta-information might change and that changes the sha256 sum of it. But solely as an entropy source, I don't see why not.

Exactly. Only a few days ago, an actual murderer in Austria was sentenced to 15 years in prison. The sentence you get for armed robbery, wrongful imprisonment, trespass and coercion wouldn't even be higher than that, so an additional rape and murder wouldn't even cost them anything in terms of risk. (In Europe, sentences generally don't sum up, you serve the longest sentence, if you committed more than one crime. So a murder yielding you 15 years + robbery for 10 years isn't 25 years, it's still 15.)

Come on, don't be dishonest. You know that this implies payments in the $1 to $100 range. 


Because Satoshi himself and many others in contact with him and most developers right now agree, that Bitcoin can't scale on-chain to global adoption. Luckily, it doesn't have to, because we already have lots of very fast, easy and cheap *payment systems* to transact. Unfortunately, they are used to transact fiat money. In comes Bitcoin, to replace this fundamental flaw in the economy, the easy base money.
Now luckily, with developments like LN, we probably will have Bitcoin being the base money (to settle debt) *and* LN transactions (which are actual bitcoin transactions, just not settled yet) to transact that money. So LN would be the payment system, bitcoin the settlement system.
I for one don't actually care. I'm fine with banking, i.e. having bitcoin being treated like gold held by banks, customers transacting in bitcoin backed currency and only having inter-bank clearance settled on the blockchain. As long as there's free entry into the industry, which there is with bitcoin, that's all fine. (and I didn't say you have to put your life savings in the bank, only what ever you reasonably want to transact.)

Your BCH are coupled with the private key of the BTC address, that held BTC before and during August 1st.
I'm not quite sure which wallet held what when in your setup, but it looks like there are basically two options:
Options 1: breadwallet
Option 2: Electrum.
Breadwallet actually has a BCH-withdraw function now, but you can follow this step by step guide to manually separate BTC from BCH out of breadwallet: 
If the relevant addresses/keys are the ones in Electrum, you can export them from Electrum and sweep them into ElectronCash. But first send all the BTC to a new BTC wallet, for example Copay on your iPhone, before exposing the private keys to ElectronCash.

True, but look at the upside of this trade: 5000 CAD. How life changing can 5000 CAD be? Is there no other way to obtain 5000 CAD, other than selling 4000 BTC?
Holding Bitcoin is a highly asymmetric bet. The downside of this guy holding is foregoing the potential consumption of 5000 CAD worth of goods. The upside is astronomical.
EDIT: To everybody who answered something like "hindsight is 20/20" or "well, if 5000 CAD isn't life changing, go and buy shitcoin X for 5000 CAD". You can only say that, if you have spent zero seconds on the fundamentals of bitcoin. Once you realize what an unchangable, immutable, uncensorable hard money means, you wouldn't sell for 5000 CAD, nor would you equate it with buying some shitcoin. Saif's talk in Vienna that is still stickied on top of this sub is a great start to comprehend the point I made about holding bitcoin being a once in a lifetime chance of a highly asymmetric bet.

Security by obscurity. Not a good idea.
If I weren't able or willing to memorize an actually secure passphrase, i.e. something with at least 128 bits of entropy, I'd go with a less secure passphrase, lets say 64 bits of entropy and key-stretch the shit out of it. Like 10 consecutive runs of Warp-Wallet and then using the resulting private key as the passphrase.
Here's a demonstration with 3 runs. The passphrase is this 6-word BIP39 mnemonic, which is roughly 64 bits of entropy:
`diet proof purity blind jacket design`
Feeding it through WarpWallet returns the private key:
Now I'm going to put the seed + this private key again into WarpWallet, so the second input is:
`diet proof purity blind jacket design+5K98fpurH6RgpynUicCRL9dD9r4w81ZdivMa2CoUkDmQ7cpSxMS`
This returns the private key
And for the last time, the seed + that second private key gives us the input
`diet proof purity blind jacket design+5JBhBN5ffVPRkUhG6d6r5MekSCbfWJVuwmFwP6PPERs5dyzXzhS`
and the final private key
which is the encryption-passphrase.
Or use `gpg` with a shit-ton of key-streching like this:
`gpg -v --output $OUTFILE --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-mode 3 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 65600000 $INFILE`

I actually think that his is what is going to happen and what is inevitable and not that bad actually.
First, we have to differentiate between transaction and payment. Transaction the data that is in the block in a physical sense and payment is what a person wants to do in an economic sense.
I also think, that not only will higher layer applications be the most consumer level used payments engine, no matter what the price in the base layer is.
I also think that 100k people counter-balancing their funds^(in the sense that Alice owes Bob 10 sat, bob owes Charlie 10 sat, so Alice simply pays Charlie 10 sat, instead of Alice paying Bob and Bob paying Charlie) and making then one transaction on chain to settle that is the only feasible solution.
A non-trusted, or minimally trusted, method is LN.
But I also have absolutely no problem with using banks for that. Banking is not the devil. In a free market, banks fulfill a very important role. And without the possibility of inflation through money printing (i.e. 21mil hardcap intact) or credit expansion (constant prove of reserves, no fractional reserve bitcoin-banking), they really are tied in what they can do with the funds.
And maybe even all of that is doable without the banks being even possible to run with the money, using elaborate multi-sig and time-lock contracts.
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:01:57


Provable reserves, decentralized storage, cheap transfer ($1000 to transfer $1b is cheap), and the fact alone, that holders of bitcoin, be that individuals or institutions or even governments can take the funds to their grave is an enormous advantage. The fact that overthrown governments don't drop any loot anymore, is a huge deterrent to even try for one state to incorporate another.

You can use a m-of-n-multisig setup and store enough seeds/keys outside of the jurisdiction you are worried about, or across multiple jurisdictions.
Or achieve sort of the same thing with using a m-of-n SSSS [1].
Either way, be sure to use an airgapped machine when setting your wallet up, preferably follow the Glacier Protocol [2] and use software that's been around for a while and will be around for a while.
For example, either use like in Glacier described, simple Bitcoin private keys. I personally think, that software like Electrum will be around for pretty much ever too, so I'd use that instead.
Casa Hodl uses a 3-of-5 multi-sig setup, which I think is superior to the 2-of-4 that Glacier suggests.

Due to the low difficulty of mining BCH (aka Bcash, Btrash or Bitcoin Cash), a relatively large amount of miners have currently switched to mining BCH. This leads to longer block times, longer confirmation times and thus higher fees on Bitcoin.
On  you can see, how long it will take for the difficulty to adjust and miners switching back to Bitcoin once again, to see Bitcoin transaction throughput returning to normal levels.

Here it is very important to understand the difference between "medium of exchange" and "currency".
Lets go old-school:
I can't afford a vault and security staff 24/7 in my house, so I pay a bank to vault my gold.
The bank is kind enough to issue tamper-proof paper bank-notes, redeemable for gold.
If I trade you a solid-gold bar for your car, the medium of exchange we're using is gold, obviously.
If I trade you gold-backed paper bank-notes for your coffee, the medium of exchange *is still gold*. The currency is the paper bank-note. Only in the perverse fiat-money world, currency (the paper certificate) equals the money, which is nothing more than the most widely accepted medium of exchange.
Medium of exchange does not mean "the thing that Alice hands over to Bob".
That being said: No, if on-chain transactions aren't economically viable for small amounts, that does not mean that people have to move into something other than Bitcoin. Our fictitious coffee-for-gold-backed-paper-bank-note trade didn't mean that I moved from gold to paper.

Btw, look into GoldMoney.com. You actually can have a 100% gold backed bank account and still use the fiat money system.

* Make a backup of the wallet file on at least two external media. For example, two USB thumb drives
* On the computer that has the wallet-file go offline and start bitcoin-qt
* Export all private keys into a text-file by using the command `dumpwallet /path/to/where/wallet-dump/will/be/wallet.txt`
* Install breadwallet on iOS or Greenbits on Android
* Write the recovery seed on paper and store it securely with your other important documents.
* Sweep the private key(s) that had bitcoins into the wallet.
For easier sweeping, you can copy and paste the private key(s) into the Wallet Details tab of a locally saved copy of bitaddress.org to generate the QR code of the private key. Attention: be super sure to go to bitaddress.org. There are a few phisihing sites impersonating bitaddress.org.
Once you did that, you can start cashing out all the various fork-coins by simply also sweeping the key(s) again into them.

Coinbase seems to be a really shitty exchange. Given your restrains, here's something that might work, but you should do the math on it if it actually would come out cheaper:
* Register with for example HitBTC.com. No need for extensive KYC/AML stuff, this is going to be crypto-to-crypto.
* Sell BTC on Coinbase
* Buy LTC on Coinbase
* Send LTC to HitBTC.com
* Buy BTC with LTC
* Withdraw BTC from HitBTC.com to your wallet.
Again, I don't know if this is actually cheaper. You could also write customer support and demand they stop overpaying fees in such a ridiculous manner. 
Bitstamp.net for example does a great job. They use SegWit and they bundle withdraws in such large volumes, that it really is only a few cents per person, even when block-fees are relatively high.
Bitstamp also trades LTC, if you want to give it a try for the above scheme.

*IF* on-chain for 8 billion people doing 10 transactions a day *personally* and doing 10k transactions in the background (like the supplier of the apple he just bought paying the electrical company that pays the trucking company etc.) is possible, it will be done. Why wouldn't it? But it's not. But who knows what technology brings (doubtful, because of physical constrains, like in speed of light and quantum mechanics kind of way), or math (some elliptic curve math-magic collapsing thousands of transactions into one or whatever).
The last point is never addressed by big-blockers, btw. Bob paying Charlie for coffee is only the tip of the iceberg in payments. Like with consumer vs. capital goods.

This is what Hoppe debunks in a simple Sokratic question: if spending money, i.e. consuming, makes people richer, why are there poor countries? Every country can "increase spending", yet not all countries are rich.
What grows the economy is capital accumulation. Which happens if people *save* money. 
I recommend to watch or read "How an Economy grows and why it doesn't" by Irwin Schiff:

Due to the low difficulty of mining BCH (aka Bcash, Btrash or Bitcoin Cash), a relatively large amount of miners have currently switched to mining BCH. This leads to longer block times, longer confirmation times and thus higher fees on Bitcoin.
On  you can see, how long it will take for the difficulty to adjust and miners switching back to Bitcoin once again, to see Bitcoin transaction throughput returning to normal levels.

First: make at least one backup of the wallet.dat file to an external medium like a USB thumb drive.
After you sweeped them into Electrum, you can sweep them again into [ElectronCash]( to get your Bitcoin Cash. Don't install ElectronCash and Electrum on the same machine. ElectronCash has a history of messing up Electrum installations. A [Linux virtual machine]( in [VirtualBox]( could be the host for ElectronCash.
And after you did all of that, you can use bitcoin-qt to claim [BitCore-tokens]( I don't know of a good BitCore wallet for MacOS or iOS, tough. Coinomi on Android works great.
And after all the coins have been cleaned out from the private keys, you can claim your [ClamCoins]( if you held a balance before and during May 12th 2014.

Start Electrum, click on the little seed icon in the bottom right corner, type in password and write the seed on paper.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:36:39
The idea is generally good. I just have few minor suggestions.
* Read the Wikipedia article on password strength: and make sure the password you are using has 128-bits of entropy or more.
* If you use the inbuilt encryption function of bitcoin-qt, you can put the encrypted wallet on your hot system and generate new addresses on the fly as you need them. If you use the current version 0.15.1, the wallet.dat you'll create is a deterministic wallet, so once backed up, you can create (practically) infinite new addresses without having to make a backup again.
* You should mitigate the risk of memory loss of the password by having paper backups of the password physically separate from the wallet. For example a bank deposit box and or in your physical wallet. If someone robs you of the slip of paper, he still doesn't have the file.
* There is no harm in uploading the encrypted file to cloud storage, if the encryption is strong and password has 128-bits of entropy or more. I would put it into an encrypted 7zip-file or something else of the kind with some different name, to not draw attention to the fact that it's a wallet.
Another nice method is using Electrum as cold storage: 
The cool thing about Electrum is, that the private keys are derived from a 12 word seed and 12 words is very easily memorized. I for example walk a very well known route in my head and place the words in the same positions. Like for example if the 3rd word is `flag` in the 3rd position of my memory-route there's something odd, like leprechaun, standing waving a flag. It's strangely easy to memorize a 12 word seed that way.
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:27:12
First of all, if you haven't done so, make a backup copy of the wallet.dat file on an external medium, like a USB thumb drive.
Then do the following: 
* Install Greenbits on your Android device or breadwallet on your iOS device
* Write the recovery seed on paper and store it securely with your other important documents
* Downloud the [Bitaddress.org-ZIP-file]( 
* Now you can disconnect your PC from the Internet, if you want to.
* Extract the bitaddress-ZIP-file and open the bitaddress HTML file in your browser. Wiggle around to make the annoying dots disappear. All you need this for, is to conveniently display QR codes later.
* Open bitcoin-qt
* Click on `Help -&gt; Debug Window`
* In the Debug Window, click on the Tab `Console`
* In the text field on the bottom of the Console window, type the command `walletpassphrase 'your+Super-Secure_Passphrase' 500` to unlock the wallet for 500 seconds.
* Now type in the command `dumpprivkey 1theAddressYouSentYourBTCto1234`.
* Copy the private key that is now displayed into the "Wallet Details"-tab of your local copy of Bitaddress.
* Click on "View Details"
* Check if the address displayed is the one you used before
* Check if the private key displayed is correct
* Now you can sweep the balance into Greenbits/breadwallet by scanning the private key.

If the app forces the user to use a mildly strong passphrase, and they salt it with the users e-mail and the Coinbase-user-account-number or whatever, and then do a key stretching akin to WarpWallet,
*and* the user stores like 20 BTC in that
*and* the cloud account actually gets compromised,

If tether goes down, the price of bitcoin measured in tether will go up. Economically speaking, tether going down would mean lots of people will want to buy bitcoins to secure their funds, i.e. driving the price up.
However, there's a psychological/perception angle too. You know, like when one exchange gets hacked, the press screams "bitcoin got hacked!", "bitcoin is dead" whatever? This of course would bring the price down.
So your guess is as good as anybody's as to which factor is the stronger one.
But to be honest, if the rumors about tether are true, it's just yet another unbacked, hyper-inflating fiat-currency. If people in Zimbabwe are trading bitcoin for Zimbabwe-dollars and the Zimbabwe-dollar gets inflated to crap-levels, why would that matter for the price of bitcoin, OTHER than demonstrating to world, that it's untouchable by fiat-scammers, be that governments or private institutions like Bitfinex?

That's still fraud, even if he's correct in saying, that there is no "officially" defined term for apple and everybody is free to follow or not follow the most widespread biological definition.

The 21mil hardcap is one of the most important selling points of bitcoin. 
If you can squeeze in that many transactions and still keep the block size small, that would be cool.
But to be honest, even then base layer Bitcoin sucks for consumers. The fact alone, that inclusion into a block is a probabilistic event that can take anywhere between 1 second and 3 hours makes it unattractive for day to day use anyway.
I predict, that no matter how many transactions fit into the base layer, the vast majority of consumer transactions will be in higher layers, even if there's no significant price difference.

It's called "Shortest path problem". You can add "weight" or "cost" to a potential path. You might have to "ping" the nodes to find out, what it "costs" to travel through that node.
I put so many quotation marks in the text, because that problem is very general. The cost can be "time it takes to reach a point" or "fuel a car burns on it's way" and so on.

That's not how this works. If you receive BCH thinking it's BTC because the wallet doesn't explicitly make a difference by separating them into different accounts, you won't be able to send to a BTC wallet.
The user sends his balance, thinking he's transacting BTC, but the recipient won't see anything happening, because you've sent a BCH transaction. The recipient now has to manually export the private key of the BTC address and sweep it into a dedicated BCH wallet. Most exchange won't even do that for you. That's on you and you now burned your BCH.

Miners are literally the least important actors in the bitcoin eco-system. If you're honestly not a troll, you've got to look into the mechanism of difficulty adjustment. 
Even if current, double-sha256-ASIC miners leave for *whatever*coin, the only thing that happens is, that the difficulty goes down and GPU mining becomes profitable again. This truly is a non-issue. The only thing that's annoying is the long block time, but that's really only a nuisance.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:37:09
Due to the low difficulty of mining BCH (aka Bcash, Btrash or Bitcoin Cash), a relatively large amount of miners have currently switched to mining BCH. This leads to longer block times, longer confirmation times and thus higher fees on Bitcoin.
On  you can see, how long it will take for the difficulty to adjust and miners switching back to Bitcoin once again, to see Bitcoin transaction throughput returning to normal levels.
It's a nuisance, but unfortunately inevitable. If you aren't in a hurry, I'd just wait for the readjustment.

The transaction fees aren't that high, actually. In normal operation, i.e. 10 minute block times, you get 30-40 sat/byte transaction confirmed usually in the 1st block.
It's just that every time the BCH difficulty adjust downward, miners switch over for temporarily higher profits, which leads to longer block times on bitcoin.

I thought so too, but Blue Matt on the what Bitcoin did podcast recently had very good arguments, why both, tail emission (like GRIN) and constant inflation rate of say, 1% p.a. (like Peter Todd suggests), are nonsensical.
In short: constant inflation rate equals exponential growth of inflation over time (as in compound interest). That one's easy to get.
But tail emission is nonworkable either, because over time, whatever reward is payed, compared to the overall networks market cap and assets to be secured, it's going to be minuscule. 
But the security model of Bitcoin (and all PoW systems) always rely on the balance between "gain from mining honestly vs. gain from attacking the network". If I can transact a trillion USD and the reward is 50 BTC worth 100k each, I don't care about those. 
Both tail emission and constant inflation simply kick the can down the road. Neither are long term solutions.

No. BCH was created specifically to avoid having SegWit, because that would have fixed a bug in the bitcoin-protocol called "transaction malleability", which the creator of BCH is exploiting in a way called ASICboost, which gives him a competitive edge against other miners, because he patented that and is the only one using it.
In fact: If you send BCH to a SegWit-address which is encoded in a legacy P2SH address (starting with 3), you might have burned the BCH for good.

You have been andvertised to falsely, then. Bitcoin is not intended to become a cheap replacement for payment processors ala PayPal.
One can argue, that it is physically infeasible to combine decentralization (and as a consequence immutability and the impossibility of confiscation) with cheap transactions.
The reason is the game theoretical trade offs that have to be made in order for Bitcoin to work, which make transaction processing and recording intentionally expensive.
And, they always have been expensive. They have been subsidized by a relatively high inflation rate over the years. Luckily the influx of new adoption compensated the inflation, but sooner or later, fees will have to pay for securing the network.
There is literally no other way, in a physical and in an economic sense.

I'm assuming you held Bitcoin before and during the fork on that Mycelium wallet and your cell phone is an Android phone.
Here's what you do: 
Setup that Ledger wallet, write the recovery seed on paper and store it securely with your other important documents and create a Bitcoin wallet.
Send all the bitcoins you have on your Mycelium wallet to that Ledger Bitcoin wallet.
Then install Coinomi on Android. Write the recovery seed on paper and store it securely with your other important documents. In it, create a Bitcoin Cash wallet.
Install [ElectronCash]( on the computer and chose the option to restore from a seed you already have. When you are at the window to type in your seed, click on options and check "BIP39 Seed". Then "OK" and then write your Mycelium seed into the text box. When you're done, you should see the Bcash balance matching your Bitcoin balance you previously had in Mycelium.
Now you can send the whole Bcash balance to your Coinomi wallet.
Retire the Mycelium seed. Don't throw it away, but don't use it anymore.
You can exchange Bcash for Bitcoins at HitBTC.com or ShapeShift.io.
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:47:40
Make sure you have copied the Electrum Address correctly into the receiving address-field at Coinbase. You can also try to paste the address into the search field of Blockchain.info and see if it shows zero balance (or if you have a balance if it shows that). Blockchain.info, as does Coinbase, checks addresses for validity to stop people from accidentally sending to an address with a typo. 
Again, copy and paste the address.
As to sending bitcoin right now, maybe you want to wait for a few hours anyway:
Due to the low difficulty of mining BCH (aka Bcash, Btrash or Bitcoin Cash), a relatively large amount of miners have currently switched to mining BCH. This leads to longer block times, longer confirmation times and thus higher fees on Bitcoin.
On  you can see, how long it will take for the difficulty to adjust and miners switching back to Bitcoin once again, to see Bitcoin transaction throughput returning to normal levels.

It's kind of like holding your bitcoin with your own keys. Until you do it, and get used to it, it's hard to understand.
It's a sovereignty thing. Just like when you're holding your own keys, nobody can confiscate your wealth (if you do it right), verifying your balance using your own full node, which crunched the whole blockchain from the Genesis block forward until the present, gives one an empowering feeling of sovereignty. 
I for one will never look back to "light" wallets again. I'm running the latest Bitcoin core client, through TOR and when I'm not at home, I connect my light client via Orbot directly to my node.
Running your node through TOR (once it's fully synced, or else it would take too long), also has the benefit that you don't have to port-forward.

* They hold their customers Bcash-tokens hostage until Jan 2018, leading in an artificial shortage and price increase of Bcash, to the detriment of their bitcoin holding customers
* They participated in the recent contentious hardfork attempt called B2X, seeding uncertainty in the bitcoin ecosystem, again to the detriment of their bitcoin holding customers
To be honest, the only exchange I can recommend without hesitation is Bitstamp.net. Kraken would be good too, but their site is down too often for me to recommend them without hesitation.
As to hacking: Just use a secure browser, like Google Chrome on a system with all applied updates. Use a very strong password, I recommend using Lastpass as the password generator and manager and enable 2-factor-authentication via Google Authenticator.

Yes. Simply sweep the corresponding private key(s) into a Btrash wallet. Coinomi on Android has Btrash support, ElectronCash is a dedicated Btrash wallet. But be cautious with the last one, because it might screw up an existing Electrum installation. I'd install it in a virtualmachine, for example Ubuntu running in VirtualBox.

There's nothing to disagree with. Those are the facts. The reason why Btrash isn't "congested" is, because nobody is actually using it, as evidenced by the 50kb block after 50kb block, and not because they have 8MB blocks.
To all fence-sitter would-be-investors: here's a tip: run a full-node. Yesterday I resynced my Litecoin fullnode after weeks and weeks of being offline. Almost nothing happened in the meantime. Look at the traffic, nothing. And I'm not even shitting on Litecoin. I like Litecoin. But the truth is, nobody is actually using it. I'm sure it's similar with Btrash.
Then run a Bitcoin full-node and realize, why increasing the blocksize, even seemingly only a small amount, has exponential long term consequences.

By the same token, i.e. cost of production vs. exchange value, nothing is in a greater bubble, than fiat (paper) money which has a cost of production of practically zero and an exchange [value of arbitrary size](
Which is why everybody who recognizes the state of the financial system, gets the fuck out of fiat. Cypress anyone? Greece? Venezuela defaulting? Italian banks on the brink of insolvency? The FED's QE forever? 10 years of stagflation? Endless spending of the welfare-warfare-state?

Nothing has intrinsic value. [Value is subjective]( 
You are right to think that something has to have a direct use in order to emerge as a medium of exchange, like the industrial or ornamental uses for gold. [See Mises' Regression Theorem of Money](
This direct use of bitcoin is the ability to facilitate writing operations into a global database, the state of which is cryptographically verifiable without trust in a third party. This is sort of "the industrial or ornamental use" of bitcoin.

Okay, the first thing is to send your actual bitcoins away from that wallet into a new wallet. Because you have an iPhone, I'd recommend installing the [breadwallet]( app. Write the recovery seed on paper and store it securely with your other important documents.
You may also have to upgrade the bitcoin-qt installation in order for this step by step guide to work:
**OR: If you want to outsource this to me, contact me via e-mail at `btc.help.1234 I'll do all of that for you for 10% of the holdings or a maximum of $750.**
* Get the [Bitaddress.org-ZIP-file]( on the computer with the wallet. Either download it or transfer it with a USB drive.
* Now you can disconnect your PC from the Internet, if you want to.
* Extract the bitaddress-ZIP-file and open the bitaddress HTML file in your browser. Wiggle around to make the annoying dots disappear. All you need this for, is to conveniently display QR codes later.
* Open bitcoin-qt
* Click on `Help -&gt; Debug Window`
* In the Debug Window, click on the Tab `Console`
* In the text field on the bottom of the Console window, type the command `walletpassphrase 'your+Super-Secure_Passphrase' 500` to unlock the wallet for 500 seconds.
* Now type in the command `dumpprivkey 1theAddressYouSentYourBTCto1234`.
* Copy the private key that is now displayed into the "Wallet Details"-tab of your local copy of Bitaddress.
* Click on "View Details"
* Check if the address displayed is the one you used before
* Check if the private key displayed is correct
* Now you can sweep the balance into breadwallet by scanning the private key.
* Save that private key into a text-file called `private-keys.txt`
* Repeat the process until you emptied out all addresses/keys from your old wallet.dat-file into breadwallet.
* When you have all your bitcoins in breadwallet, we'll tackle getting your Bitcoin Cash, BitCore and Clams. Yes, there have been a few forks/spin-offs of Bitcoin, each is worth a little and can be cashed out for Bitcoins.

@_date: 2017-11-12 10:36:31


No. Depending on how fast you want to access your BCH, I'd do the following:
**Case 1: you want it fast**
* Create a new Bitcoin paper wallet and send the whole bitcoin balance over to the new address.
* Install a BCH wallet. For example Coinomi on Android has support for BCH, or [ElectronCash]( If you chose to use ElectronCash, I advise to install it on a separate machine, for example a virtual machine of Ubuntu in VirtualBox.
* After the bitcoin transaction to your new bitcoin address confirmed, sweep the private key that held your bitcoin on Aug 1st into the BCH wallet.
The upside: This is fast and secure. The downside, you'll have to pay a relatively high Bitcoin transaction fee, [for at least the next 12 hours or so](
**Case 2: you don't need the BCH that fast**
* Do the same as above, just wait for the difficulty adjustment and bitcoin mining returning to normal.
You can exchange BCH for BTC on HitBTC.com.

Beginning at this sentence, you're staring to make mistakes.
That's not the relationship between medium of exchange and money. Everything you trade in order to trade it in the future for consumption goods, is a medium of exchange. Think cigarettes in a prison. Even if you don't smoke, you're going to trade the cookies your mom brought you for cigarettes, in order to trade them for Playboy magazines later. Cigarettes are now a medium of exchange.
Money is simply the most dominant medium of exchange in a certain economic area. It's not a clear cut definition, at which point something becomes the money.
There is no doubt that bitcoin is a medium of exchange right now. People buy bitcoin in order to exchange it for other stuff in the future. That has been the case ever since Pizza day.
Why is it so important, if it is "officially" the money in where you live? The point is, that at least oppressive regimes will never accept it as money, i.e. as the most widespread medium of exchange, but that you don't have to care about that.

IIRC, LN is possible without malleability fix, but only in a convoluted way and also not trustless. You would have to setup 2 payment channels between 2 nodes and LN nodes could run with the money.
This question is of academic interest anyway, because the only network that doesn't have a malleability fix rolled out is the BCH network. The reason is most probably that Bitmain/Jihan doesn't want the ASICboost bug to be fixed, as it works in his favor and also doesn't want competition to mining itself. Go figure how decentralized that network is, if a simple bug fix will never be applied, because one guy/one company would stand to lose money.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:39:45
That's actually better, because with 30 GB blocks, that network is going to be completely centralized and censored anyway, so might as well ditch the whole blockchain. Under these circumstances, using a regular database is clearly better, because the point of having a blockchain in the first place is completely moot.

Due to the low difficulty of mining BCH (aka Bcash, Btrash or Bitcoin Cash), a relatively large amount of miners have currently switched to mining BCH. This leads to longer block times, longer confirmation times and thus higher fees on Bitcoin.

This death spiral thing doesn't work, if there are people who want to continue the chain that's death-spiraling. Here's the worst case: 100% of double-sha256-miners stop mining BTC. Users upgrade to the next version of Bitcoin that does a similar thing that the Bitcoin Gold guys pulled off quite elegantly: algorithm switch and manual difficulty adjustment. The difficulty only has to be in the ballpark, doesn't matter if block time is 1h or 1minute, as long as it runs again. Difficulty adjusts, and everything continues as normal.
Here's what btrash shills don't get: Bitcoin isn't centralized. It's not like in Btrash or Etherescam world, where the whole network is basically one company and if the company loses financial interest in the project, it just gets abandoned. The bitcoin-blockchain is our shared DNA and it mutates and adapts to new environments.
The blockchain isn't an ephemeral breeze that has to be kept alive by miners. It's spread out over thousands of nodes worldwide and if it stops at Block 632116 for whatever reason and we pick it up later, block 632117 will be mined and the show continues.

Miners, as in the machines themselves, never stop. In fact, that would be dangerous, because they consume quite a bit of electricity. Having them humm along constantly is safer than varying the current that flows through them.
So in the few seconds between having found the last block and building the new block, they just work on an empty block. Because they have to run anyway and the worst that can happen is you find within a few seconds a valid hash and get the miner reward.
And to answer your question: that one transaction is the coinbase transaction that issues the new bitcoins and pays the miner.

On  you can see, how long it will take for the difficulty to adjust and miners switching back to Bitcoin once again, to see Bitcoin transaction throughput returning to normal levels.
It's a nuisance, but unfortunately inevitable. If you aren't in a hurry, I'd just wait for the readjustment.

Bitcoin isn't "mathematical" money. It's as physical as it gets, turning huge amounts of electrical energy to heat while producing tons of entropy (hence the giant air conditioning units in mining farms). The mathematical part is the prove of the work done. That's new and that's the game changer. Mathematical prove of physical work.

* Lots of people went into BTC expecting "free B2X airdrop coins", leading to a sharp increase in price over the last few days
* BCH is expected to HF on Nov 13th, so the same "muh free fork-coins" people probably now pulled out of BTC and into BCH, hence a drop in BTC and a rise in BCH.
* Needless to say, such people don't contribute the the long term price of BTC anyway, hence a pullback in price
* Of course alt-coin shills use this opportunity to once again proclaim the final death of bitcoin. So nothing new really.

Not really. This would be quick work for chain analysis. If the sum of what you withdrew from the exchange is equal to that which goes to your HW wallet, it's an easy guess. Don't consolidate the Wasabi UTXO's into one UTXO at your HW wallet. You can consolidate a little, but it's a judgment call.
Let's say you Wasabi'd 0.835304 BTC and now have 8 UTXO's in Wasabi, all about 0.1 BTC but in total ~0.835304. If you consolidate into one UTXO again, you just lost the game. But maybe having 8 UTXO's with ~0.1 BTC isn't what you want? Maybe you want to consolidate into 3 UTXO's with random balances.  Okay, but what if you do all that within 3 blocks? Again, the time proximity of these UTXO's moving gives away information.

Just be responsible, is my recommendation. Many here advise to "work for BTC" or exchange your salary to BTC, pay wherever possible with it. I don't know about that. That sounds forced to me. You can't force adoption. It comes naturally by people wanting to hold BTC rather than USD/EUR/... 
I think living below your means, i.e. having money left at the end of the month, and then putting 50% of that towards BTC is a good long term strategy.
If you follow the "Proof of Keys" ( mantra, you're doing good:
* Run your own node, preferably a Bitcoin Core node: 
* VERY IMPORTANT: Manage your private keys yourself and point the wallet you use for that at your full node. Proof-of-Keys recommends Armory, I'd rather use Electrum ( with Electrum Personal Server.
* Read the Glacier protocol, to get a feel for security in regards to key management
* Use dedicated hardware as your key management tool. An old $200 Thinkpad from eBay where you physically remove WiFi and Bluetooth adapters is sufficient.

Because if the recpieants of the satoshis doesn't intend to hold them, all you're doing is using the bitcoin network as a very clumsy, expensive and slow payment rail for fiat.
First people have to want to sell for BTC, then you can pay them in BTC. And not necessarily using the bitcoin network directly. More likley it's going to be LN, Visa'esque and Paypal-like payments processors etc.
What really going into bitcoin forces you to do, is get your terminology right.
You say bitcoin really is a currency.
There's a difference between:
* Money
* Unit of account
* Medium of exchange
* Method of payment
* Currency
Bitcoin is a money that comes with an integrated method of payment. This has nothing to do with it being a currency or not.
Issuing paper notes on bitcoin deposits would leave bitcoin being a money and make the paper notes currency.
LN is a method of payment for the money bitcoin, but not a currency.
Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, because people use it to exchange it for other stuff in the future.
Bitcoin is not yet a unit of account, although one could argue it is somewhat in the altcoin trading scene, where you measure your gain relative to BTC.
In my opinion, the one thing bitcoin isn't, is a currency. That's why I hate the term "crypto currency". The source of this confusion is probably because we are all used to the money simultaneously also being the currency. There's no difference between the *money* USD and the *currency* USD. There *was* a difference, when the USD notes were the *currency* to the *money* gold.
**Spending vs. Hodling**
**Gresham's law**


In short: Why would I spend the money, that's expected to rise in value, i.e. Bitcoin? I'd rather spend the money, which is expected to fall in value, i.e. fiat.
**"The Yield from Money Held" Reconsidered**


In short: Because individual financial sovereignty is the number one usecase for Bitcoin, naturally, holding it is the most desired action for most people. Yes, holding Bitcoin is using Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not here to be a better PayPal or Visa, which it never can be due to physical (like the laws of physics) restrictions on how well a blockchain scales compared to a centralized system. It's here to replace the Dollar, Euro, Gold.
**Spend and replace** 
Furthermore, merely spending Bitcoin would of course weaken its price. The more supply there is on the market, the lower the price will go. It doesn't matter which thing is on the other side of the trade, if it's a USD note, or a donkey, or an apple.
Spending bitcoin is probably a good way to circulate bitcoin towards people who, for various reasons, don't buy bitcoin directly, using an exchange, or Bitcoin ATM. But you should always replace what you spent, ideally in the same moment and ideally a little more than you spent. For example, if you just spent 0.015 BTC, rebuy 0.018 BTC instantly.

The best way forward, if there can be sensible legislation in the first place, maybe this is something the world just has to deal with, like TOR which can also be abused, is to criminalize the possession of software that makes these files readily available and even that is stretching it, because there is legitimate usage to store metadata on the blockchain. So this would actually be more like making FTP clients illegal. 


But they are not. They are distributing pseudo-random data that if someone knows what he's looking for and applies a very convoluted and complicated method, can be interpreted as illegal imagery. If you have a copy of the blockchain, you don't have image data on your hard drive. If you think you do, any random blob of data is equally dangerous to possess, because there might be a string of bits that if found and converted, is illegal data.

I was expecting this. No, that's of course not okay, because the nature of the RAR-archive is still being a store of CP. The nature of the blockchain is a store of a transnational history. Also, the guy who split up the illegal data and encoded it into transactions didn't create the blockchain. He used the blockchain that was already there. In your example, you would be the sole creator of the RAR-archive.


This would be too far reaching, which doesn't mean it won't be codified into law. I'm fairly certain, that within the data on your hard drive, you are currently in possession of illegal data. Not CP, the information that constituted an image is too large to found by chance within a TB of binary data. But somewhere for sure, there is, simply by chance, an illegal number like some (old and by todays standard way too short) encryption key the MPAA claims to own etc. At the very least, you don't know if that's the case or not.
The law doesn't usually operate on "well, this nerd over here can trivially make this zig into that zag and therefore that's illegal". Intent is important, the notion of "does the average person know this/do this/expects this/..." is important and so on.

Again, there is no image data on the blockchain. So you can't take the program used out of regard. If you do so, again everybody is liable for everything.

* has no chargeback functionality
* is almost nowhere accepted as a payment option
* if someone accepts it, they 99.99% of the time simply sell for fiat, which means effectively I just sold bitcoin market price?
When I also can spend
* money that loses value over time, guaranteed,
* is generally excepted
* has depending on the payment network I use, chargeback
Makes no sense.
Money and payments are a layered network.
Bitcoin is the bottom layer, comparable to BIS or IMF, with FED/ECB functionality (i.e. issuance). No average person uses that to do transactions. The fact that we can is only because Bitcoin adoption is so small still.
Layer 2, like Lightning, will make transacting easier and will allow layer 3 and 4 solutions like Visa, MasterCard, Paypal to be implemented too.
But, even then, as long as Bitcoin hasn't swallowed most of the store of value functionality of fiat currencies, stocks, bonds, real estate, art, gold, ... it *still* would make little sense to spend it, as long as some idiot actually accepts the depreciating fiat notes.

Your analogy sucks, that's the problem. The blockchain in your analogy is not the equivalent to the file server or the command and control server. It's the equivalent to the copper wires, switches and routers. If someone abuses the infrastructure of the Internet, like wires, switches, gateways and full-nodes, you go after the criminal, not the maintainer of the infrastructure.
Now you say "but the maintainer hosts the illegal data" and then I say, again, no he doesn't. He hosts pseudo-random data that takes effort to extract illegal data from.

That's wrong. The size of a transaction is too small to contain an image. You have to have outside information and a process to act on this information to extract the bits from all the involved transactions and stitch them together. By themselves, they are simply pseudo-random blobs *and not images, videos, or some other content type containing illegal information*.
If *data-set-1 + unknown outside information + special program* equals possession of *arbitrary data-set-2*, then any data qualifies, i.e. you're a criminal too.
The program you need to construct out of your last holiday photo illegal data, is simply one that XORs your photo with the XOR of your photo and the illegal data. Do you have that program? No. Do you know that XOR-data? No, so that's why your holiday photo is okay to have and even redistribute.

That's the point. "Data" on the blockchain doesn't lay around like files in a file system, ready to be displayed. You have to sort of generate them out of a lot of metadata. You have to know where that metadata is, how to extract it, how to string it together and how to interpret it. Saying that this is equivalent to "storing data" or "sharing files" is like saying "pi from digit 10^(45452) to 10^(47323)" and now somehow Reddit Inc. is responsible for storing the data that's behind these digits, after you actually calculated them, converted and interpreted them correctly.

This is where it gets esoteric. If someone possesses illegal images, these bits have a distinct beginning, designating them to being images. The data is intended to be an image and it is easy and common to interpret it as such and display it.
That's not the case with these "upload arbitrary data to the blockchain"-hacks. What you've got there, is chunks of data that constitute no image data whatsoever. You have to extract certain parts of these chunks, string them together and interpret them in a very special way, to recreate the data. 
No judge in his right mind would argue, that the purpose of such a blockchain is to distribute arbitrary data, much less that that's the intent of a typical full-node operator.


As you know, using the blockchain to upload arbitrary data is a hack, convoluted and expensive. Nobody who's intention it is to distribute illegal data will use it for such purpose.
This is a hack and many parts of the Internet infrastructure are subject to similar hacks. That's the crux with public or semi-public resources: everybody uses them, even bad guys.
Your point of bad guys using the blockchain to stealthily distribute illegal content is, I think, addresses by the fact how convoluted, slow and expensive it is to do it in such a way. Is it possible? Yes. But if it is the actual intent of that person, he or she will find a much easier way to achieve that goal. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 22:45:35
You can't actually store a file on the blockchain. You can use parts of a transaction to encode very little, a few bites, of data.
It's sort of like if someone sent someone text messages and just ends every message with let's say 4 arbitrary characters. Like "alright, see you later mnqr". And after like 1000 messages back and forth, you now have got somewhere on your phone the string "mnqrztbnqqrs...qfqlfmuv" laying around. Not actually, because you have to extract that tiny piece of the text messages out and string them together, but in some philosophical sense this string is on your phone. Now what if after actually extracting the parts from the messages, you converted that string from base26 (characters a-z) to base2 (0-1) and interpreted it as JPEG-data? Now you've got an image. If you don't do that? You've got a bunch of text messages with weird, nonsensical data appended to them.

Doesn't matter.
The one thing that's important, is that the only way to acquire Bitcoin (sans theft) is by providing value to other people. Currently fiat mostly, but really goods and services (of which the most direct way is the good "hash rate" and the service "block timestamping").
No more money printing free-loaders.

Don't invent your own crypto. The notion that splitting the seed into 2 or 3 parts makes it somehow secure is wrong.
If you want to encrypt your seed, go ahead, but do it on an offline machine, preferably using standard software like GPG. I like to use extensive key-stretching when using GPG in symmetric mode, like this:
`gpg -a -v --output $OUTFILE --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-mode 3 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 65600000 $INFILE`.
Secure and easily typed and written down passwords can also be easily generated on the command line. For example by using this command:
`head -c 16 /dev/random | base64 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -d '[:punct:]'`.
As long as you store the password offline, like in two or three secure and independent places, you absolutely can upload the encrypted file to cloud storage or your e-mail-account. There's no harm in that, *if the password is truly secure* (like when generated how I described above).

I would do something like this:
* Create new Electrum installation on a permanently offline machine. Even a temporarily installed Xubuntu will do. 
* Backup the seed on paper twice, in two different secure locations
* Copy master public key to USB thumb drive
* Import master public key to Electrum on online machine. Android works great for that.
* Nuke the offline system. Do it all over again and restore from your seed backup. Are the same addresses generated? Good. Your backup works.
* send everything over to a new Electrum address and wait for a few confirmations
* Install Coinomi on Android and also paper-backup that seed.
* Sweep your old used Electrum private keys into all the Bitcoin-Fork-wallets Coinomi offers. So far that's Bitcoin...
* Cash
* Gold
* Private
* Atom
Coinomi also has a Bitcore wallet, not quite a fork, but you get those too. Bitcore.cc.
Further forks that are probably worth wasting time over syncing full-nodes and searching for exchanges to exchange for bitcoin:
* BitcoinX
* Bitcoin Diamond
* Super Bitcoin
* Bitcoin World
* Bitcoin Pizza
* Bitcoin Faith
The Bitpie wallet + Bither can claim also a few of those, similar to how it's done with Coinomi, so you don't have to run an actual full-node of those.

The guy doesn't get two key concepts:
One: Scaling, on- and off-chain. Increased blockchain-space, either physical (bigger blocks) or virtual (better blockspace managment) decreases the price per transaction.
Two: One transaction does not equal one payment. In the future, most payments will be heavily batched together in huge multi-sign contracts over thousands of people. Using MAST and Schnorr signatures, the size (and thus cost) per payment is going to be comparably small to how transactions, especially with complex smart-contracts built in, are right now.
So having a 10x in price would lead in 10x in transaction price too, assuming equal demand for block space, that's true. But at the same time, a scaling solution that gives you 100x throughput has the same effect in the other direction.
So all in all, this is only another angle to the scaling debate.

Intent is important. If someone runs a full-node serving 200 GB of blockchain data and someone put unknown to that person a few KB of illegal content on that blockchain, how is there any intent of the full-node operator in hosting and providing that content?

The other scenario is a truly global or semi-global adoption, with at least a very large minority, if not majority of the world population (that's not starving to death), has demand to store value in Bitcoin.

No, that's impossible, because you have to have a built-in incentive mechanism to secure the blockchain in question via PoW.
If you don't have that, you've got a centralized system and then there's no point in using the blockchain-datatype.
**Edit, because it came up so often:**
The blockchain secured through PoW does one thing and one thing only: Overcoming the Byzantines General problem. In every other regard, it is very, very inefficient and bad. The only reason why one would incur all the drawbacks of blockchain, is if there is something to be gained from having a trust-less, decentralized network.
A company or a structure of companies, banks etc. do not have a need to overcome the Byzantines General problem, because they already trust each other. 
All the "blockchain not bitcoin", "private blockchain" nonsense people talk about now, is marketing, nothing else. This literally makes no sense.

You have to understand the difference between currency and money.
Money is a store of value, a unit of account and emerged as a medium of exchange. As the economy develops, the money can become more and more cumbersome to handle. 
The historic example is gold. Gold a great money. It preserves purchasing power very well, it doesn't decay, it is fungible, etc. But right now, 1 gram of gold, which is about as big as a thumbnail, costs about $42. So if you wanted to buy coffee with gold directly, lets say for $4.20, you'd have to some how chip off 1/10th of a gram from a tiny 1 gram bar. Very inconvenient.
So what you do is, you deposit your gold with a bank that then issues a currency which is 1:1 redeemable for gold. This can be then little slips of paper denoted in 1/10th or 1/100th of grams, or electronic.
So currency is sort of a second layer to money.
The cool thing with bitcoin, because if its smart-contract capabilities, it can be both at the same time. On-chain transactions are like handling physical gold, second layer solutions like LN are like currency, except now you don't have counter-party risk like you had with banks.

I think what is confusing is this sentence in your initial question:


That would be a UI error. An unconfirmed transaction means, the balance hasn't yet left the wallet. So as long as the transaction isn't confirmed, there is nothing to return, as nothing has left.
But yes, it would be confusing to then have the original transaction suddenly be mined, after the wallet maybe doesn't even show it as "pending", but simply as if nothing ever happened. The wallet should keep that in mind and then should warn the user about this and then give him the option to deliberately cancel the transaction by double-spending it. He would create a new transaction with a higher fee using the same UTXOs, but sending it to himself, a new recipient or the same recipient, depending on what he wants to do.

Focusing on scale-ability of on-chain transactions would be a waste of resources, in my opinion. Due to [Gresham's Law]( the transaction demand for bitcoin is very low anyway.
Think about it. Assuming you're American: You have two monies competeting with each other, USD and BTC. You know that the USD you hold will lose value over time due to inflation. On the other hand, you know (or at least very much suspect) that the value of your BTC will increase over time.
If you're going to buy something, which money are you going to use? Of course the USD, because you know, that a year from now, you'll only get 0.95% of a pizza for that amount of USD. Why would you use BTC to buy a pizza, if a year from now, you can get 10 pizzas for the same amount of BTC?
But you can always rebuy, right? Sure, but you'd have to permanently have USD on an exchange, so that when you do buy the pizza for BTC, you instantly can rebuy the BTC, in effect paying with USD and using BTC only as a transaction layer.
Due to Gresham's Law, bitcoin will be most attractive to hold as store of value, which produces only very little transaction demand. Every application of bitcoin that focuses on transaction throughput is in a way pointless, in regard to long term price development.
If you want to buy crypto in place A, transact to place B and then sell crypto again, you are not influencing the price of that crypto-currency. Also, for this task, literally *any* coin can be used. You might as well use dogecoin or litecoin. The person on the other side can cash that out, or change parts of it for bitcoin for long term holding.

Says who? Also, how do you determine what the demand of money is or will be in the near future?
With gold, if the demand is higher, more will be mined, because the additional cost of mining is still lower than the profit you can make from selling the new gold. This happens until equilibrium is reached again and it doesn't pay to mine new gold.
How are you going to destroy that gold, if the demand for money goes down again? Go into peoples houses and steal it? Go into banks and rob them?

I'm pretty sure that Electrum doesn't allow to import private keys anymore. It sweeps them, which means it makes a transaction, emptying out all the private keys into one of Electrums own addresses. Look at the "Addresses"-tab (you might have to add it because it's not enabled by default). You should see your BTC balance with one of the addresses of Electrum.
If that's the case, you now only have to protect the Electrum-seed and can archive the wallet.dat file (don't delete it, you never know).

I installed LinuxMint on a 16BG USB3-flash drive and enabled full disc encryption.
For the initial setup, I used a low quality placeholder password.
After creating the wallet (Electrum in my case), I added a disk encryption password of equal entropy as the Electrum seed and deleted the placeholder password. The reason is, that even if an attacker has physical access to that USB3-flash drive, he has no advantage trying to crack it over simply trying to crack Electrum seeds directly.

I hope you are joking. You should memorize a bip39 mnemonic from which you can derive as many private keys as you like and which is much easier to remember.
Here's an easy method:
* Go to  save it to a USB thumb drive, boot your live linux  and generate a 12 word mnemonic seed.
* Scroll down, you can choose BIP141 to generate the corresponding SegWit addresses.
* Copy a few addresses into a text-file and print it out.
* Generate a secure passphrase that's also easy to type in and avoids characters that are easily confused (like upper case O as in Oscar and the number zero). On the terminal you can issue the command: `$ head -c 16 /dev/random | base64 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr -d '[:punct:]'` to do so.
* Copy that passphrase to another text-file and print it out too.
* Copy the 12 word seed into another text file called `seed.txt` and encrypt it using `gpg` in symmetric mode: `gpg -a -v --output seed.txt.asc --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256 --s2k-mode 3 --s2k-digest-algo SHA512 --s2k-count 65600000 seed.txt`. The resulting ASCII-armored encrypted file is very small. You can print it out and having to retype it should you forget your passphrase is done easily.
* Memorize the 12 words. You can temporally write it on a piece of paper and burn it once you're confident you've memorized it.
* Store the encrypted seed print-out somewhere secure
* Store the password print-out somewhere else secure
* Leave a print-out of instructions in an envelope with your family in case you die
Or do as above, but instead of using  just use a new version of Electrum, generating bech32 native segwit addresses. You might have to send your bitcoins to a legacy Electrum or Samourai wallet first, to then send it further to your cold storage tough, because bech32 isn't widely supported yet.

Those are not bitcoin-transactions, tough. You sent a bulk of BTC to the debit-card-provider and he deducts in his internal system and also does even larger bulk-BTC-transactions.
That would be the equivalent of Amazon accepting BTC, because you can buy Amazon-gift cards in $100 increments. Which is possible now through 3rd parties anyway.

That person should be held liable, not for putting the image into the blockchain, because that's impossible, but because he or she had to be in possession of the image for the attempted process.


That's debatable and goes to this point:


This is the RAR-archive vs. Blockchain-argument. The nature of the encrypted RAR-archive is to easily store and distribute the illegal content. The RAR-archive *consists* of illegal content and is thus illegal content in and of itself, encrypted or not, split up or not.
But that's not true of the blockchain. It does not consists of illegal content. You can combine parts of it to create illegal content out of it. Do you honestly not see the difference here? Between something consisting of and something being able to be reconstructed to certain data?
Maybe this analogy works: In Germany it's illegal to recreate a swastika symbol (even for religious purposes which if you ask me, is very discriminating against Buddhists). So if you build a swastika emblem out of let's say 81 (9x9) LEGO blocks, you're breaking the law.
If I'm in possession of a bucket of LEGO blocks, including the necessary parts to recreate the swastika, am I in violation of the law? The swastika is "laying around" in my bucket. It's just not assembled, yet. Maybe you with the intention of assembling the swastika later put the parts into the bucket. I don't know. But am I in possession of the swastika symbol? I don't think so. I first have extract the correct parts out of the bucket and then I have to apply a special process and only then I am in possession of it.
I know this isn't a perfect analogy, but that's kind of like I see this.

It's called "systemic risk". You are comparing apples to oranges.


As I said, if you want to understand my view, you have to read up on the Austrian theory of money. But I doubt you actually want to.


You are really grasping for straws here. As I said, you can do everything you can do with gold or cash in terms of convenience vs. security with bitcoin too, but you don't have to. You can physically store your private keys in a vault, or trust them with a bank, or whatever else you think is the way to go.


No wonder. Why would anybody save money, if the interest rate is pushed so low through inflation? 
From what you write, you seem to think that holding bitcoin is an all or nothing thing. You go in with 100% of your money and if the price then drops, you're done. You can do that, and most panic sellers right now probably did that. The average, non-savings American should think about not blowing all their money on stupid, unhealthy shit and saving more. $50, $100 a month. It accumulates and over the years, you get to the point where price drops don't matter that much.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:07:42

I was thinking about cloud mining yesterday and I think it's a scam and can not *not* be a scam. Here's why:
You have to know what the marginal utility product is.
Let's say you own a horse. You will use that horse for the use that yields you the highest profit. Let's say on the race track winning you money.
If you add one additional unit of horse, a horse, you will use that for next highest profit yielding task, let's say that's plowing a field.
You add another horse, that's used to pull a cart. Another one for recreational horse back riding and so on.
With each additional horse you add, the marginal utility product gets smaller. That means, the additional productivity diminishes with every horse you add.
Here's what's amazing in Bitcoin: The marginal utility product of hashing-power is always zero. That's because if you add hashing power, the difficulty rises proportionally.
So if you have $1000 and you buy hashing-power, let's say you actually buy mining hardware and electricity, in equilibrium, you'll mine that amount of bitcoin, to which the USD-amount would have been the overall interest rate you could have earned by lending that $1000 to a bank. The only thing you can hope for, is that the bitcoins you mine earlier, will rise in value over time. That's where the actual profit comes from. The rise in bitcoin-price.
Now you can see, why you're better off just buying and holding bitcoins: you'll get the full $1000 amount of "early" bitcoins.
If you add to the equation, that you don't actually buy the mining equipment and electricity, but rent it, you have to factor in the fee you have to pay to the cloud mining provider, making your profit even lower.
And that's not even taking into consideration the risk you run of giving a 3rd party your money, that *promises* to use it to mine BTC, compared to just buying bitcoin and holding them in your own cold storage.

I'm a little confused as to what backups you currently have and don't have.
My recommendation is to do the following:
* Install Mycelium on your iOS or Android device, write down the 12 word recovery seed on paper.
* Send whatever bitcoins you have to the Mycelium wallet.
* Put all the wallet.dat files you now have into a folder
* Create a [strong password]( write it also on paper and create an encrypted 7zip archive out of that folder with all the wallet.dat files. You should also write down on paper the wallet.dat-password, in case you forget it.
* Create a new wallet.dat file with the current version of bitcoin-qt, 0.15.0.1.
* Encrypt it with a strong passphrase (write it down).
* Notice the HD logo in the bottom right corner? Make a backup of that new wallet.dat file.
* Now you can send your balance back from Mycelium to your bitcoin-qt installation.
* All addresses and keys are deterministically created from the extended-private key in your new wallet.dat-file, which you have backed up.
* Store that sheet of paper with all the passwords and the Mycelium seed with your other important documents.
* You can spread the encrypted 7zip-archive across many locations, like USB thumb drives, your laptop, Google Drive etc.
* In case you have to access one of your old private keys, everything is still there. Never delete old wallets/seeds/keys. You never know.

@_date: 2017-09-06 19:46:21
Yes. If you have your BTC in a simple paper wallet, all you've got to do, is first send your BTC to a new wallet and then sweep the "empty" private keys into a Bcash wallet, like Coinomi on Android or [ElectronCash]( on Mac/PC. Then you can exchange the Bcash for BTC using HitBTC.com or ShapeShift.io and either hold the additional BTC or sell for fiat in a BTC-exchange you're registered with.

I can only tell you why I like it. Fiat currencies are the biggest scam in history. [In this graph]( you can see what would happen, if the supply of money wasn't arbitrary, but simply market-demand driven, like it's the case with gold. In the beginning of the 70s the US went off the gold standard in the mid 70s the effects are noticeable. You can see, that the real income of people simply grows with the overall output of the economy. What a simple concept. If the people produce more, they can afford more, because in the end, everybody trades the stuff he produces for the stuff other people produce. The gap between productivity and income, is nothing else than theft through inflation.
I don't expect of bitcoin to increase in price 10x, 100x, 1000x, and so on to live as a USD-billionaire on my own private island. If it happens, I won't complain tough.
But all I truly want is not to get cheated out of the fruits of my labor. If I work and save, I don't want to be stolen from through the backdoor by inflation.
If nothing else, Bitcoin is an honest form of saving. The fact that it's easily transferable, thus also usable as a currency, even more so when LN and other 2nd layer networks are operational, even better. But store of value, in the ultimate Swiss bank account, a cold storage wallet, is for me the number one reason to own Bitcoin.

Wrong. Stability in price alone would be a scam in and off itself.
You want the price of the money vis-a-vi all other goods to steadily increase, because the productivity increases too. More goods and services competing for roughly the same amount of money, means prices of these goods and services tend to fall.
Look at [this chart]( What happened in 1971 of course, was that the US finally abandoned the gold standard.
You see the effect of "stable money" in relation to the price of labor. It's a scam. The gap between productivity and real-wages is theft through inflation.

In the meantime:
Depending on how much money is at stake, what you're comfortable with doing, how essential time is etc.:
**Offline Wallet Setup**
If you think you've got time, I'd go for an Offline-Wallet setup as described here: 
Maybe you want to buy a brand new, cheap laptop as the offline machine. Or use an old/spare laptop or PC on which you install [Ubuntu Linux]( Be sure that the hard drive is large enough.
Then install Mycelium on Android or breadwallet on iOS. Secure the recovery seed on paper and keep it secret. Even from future-ex-girlfriends. And then send all the funds to an address in your new wallet.
Once your Trezor arrives and you went through the setup (seed backup) routine, you can send your funds to one of its addresses.
**Online Wallet Setup**
If you don't want to go the offline route, go hot. But be careful. Maybe still buy a new, cheap laptop, or use an old one you've got left, install Ubuntu Linux on it, make all the upgrades and then reinstall Armory, let it sync and import your paper backup. Be sure that the hard drive is large enough.
If you don't want to buy a new laptop or don't have a spare one, maybe now is the chance to backup all your data from your main machine to an external hard drive and then install a fresh Ubuntu version on it. Make the upgrades, install Armory etc.

Every 4 years the block reward, newly minted bitcoins in every block, is halved. It started with 50 btc per block, now we're at 12.5. In June 2020, it drops to 6.25. Due to the lower supply, the price tends to rise.
Months in advance, people start trolling each other about if the price will rise after the halving. Some say yes, some say no and claim that the lower supply "is already priced into the current price". It's not.

It's not true. This has been cleared up already.
China banned ICO's a few days ago and lately stated it would close down exchanges that trade ICO's, which is sort of a given if ICO's are banned. Of course brain-dead "journalists" translate that to China closes bitcoin-exchanges.
Here's a heads up: ICO's will be banned in lots of countries. While bitcoin is by its nature more like a commodity, like gold or oil, that has to be produced and can then be sold (and used as a currency as it turns out), ICO's are more like financial securities, which are heavily regulated in every country that matters.
When the dust settles and mainstream-media lemmings realize they have been duped again, bitcoin will still be working, still be traded and... some of the bubble-money that has gone into ICO's will find its way into bitcoin, is my guess.
The price will drop, maybe even a lot lower. But my prediction is, it will rebound *heavily*, shooting past $5k easily.

@_date: 2017-09-24 18:16:20
Traditional 1MB blocks have a transaction throughput of about 7 tx/s. Bcash at 8MB blocks have potentially an 8-fold increase in that metric, which is 56 tx/s. It's an increase, but it's not a game-changer increase that justifies the long-term scale-ability problems you run into with 8MB blocks. Luckily for Bcash, nobody is using it anyway so the blocks are usually below 100kb.
True world-wide scaling can only be achieved if the scaling solution increases the tx/s 1000-fold or more, without sacrificing decentralization in the process. LN is that.

Install Linux on an encrypted partition on an air gapped computer. Use a temporary passphrase like "noodle123".
Install Electrum on that system.
Memorize the seed and use it as the passphrase instead of "noodle123". Now every time you boot the system, you have to type in the seed, which helps memorizing it.
Encrypt the seed using a strong password and print it ascii-armor'd out.
Print out the password too.
Store the ascii-armor'd encrypted seed in an envelope in a bank vault.
Store the password in your physical wallet or some other secure place other than the bank vault.
It doesn't get more secure than that. You'd have to lose your memory AND lose your password to lose your bitcoins. And an attacker would have to rob you of your password AND break into the bank vault, faster than you can install Electrum on a new system (or boot your air gapped system if it hasn't been stolen) and send all your funds to a new wallet.

What I wrote is correct. That an increase of the minimum wage increases unemployment is pretty much undisputed across all schools of economics. 
You can square some circles and try to come up with a way in which some people get payed substantially less than their productivity, the employer, the CEO,..., and who would still keep working nonetheless the amount of hours it takes to reach that productivity, in order to pay others an arbitrary amount of money, which is more than they produce.
That's what you're trying to do, in a nutshell and it doesn't work. It has been tried and studied again and again, the theoretical basis doesn't support it, but hey, knock yourself out researching the topic. It's fun.

No, the size isn't that much of a problem. It's the upload. I'm currently uploading about one TB per month.
Another problem is time to validate the blockchain, i.e. CPU usage.
I'd urge you to start running a full-node again to get a feeling of how much of your resources it uses. I have a feeling, that 99% of people who want bigger blocks don't have a full-node, most never even had one.

No. Worst case scenario is using a manual way to split the coins, similar to the one I used before the breadwallet developers officially enabled that feature from within the app itself: 
That's the benefit of owning your own keys. It might be cumbersome to get what you want, but it's always possible.

Bad idea, imo. Litecoin swings up and down with bitcoin, so if you're trying to avoid a dip or volatility, you're jumping from the frying pan into the fire.
If a chainsplit occurs, you're also missing out on having bitcoin + 2Xcoin. Maybe 2Xcoin has some value for a few days, weeks, months, who knows. Then you can exchange them for bitcoins and increase your bitcoin-holdings.

I just realized, you can export the private keys offline too. 
So you can
* Save the [BitAddress.org-ZIP-file]( to an offline machine. (only for convenience to display the exported private key as QR code)
* Install Armory on it
* Import the root key and then display the private keys of the addresses you used.
* Copy and paste the private keys into the "Wallet Details"-tab of the locally saved bitaddress-file
* You have to remove spaces in between the letters of the private key, Armory displays them funny.
* Click "View Details"
* Then double check if the address that's generated is the same as in Armory
* Check if the private key that's displayed is the same as in Armory
* Sweep it into Breadwallet on iOS or Greenbits on Android. (don't forget to first make a paper backup of the recovery seed)
* Repeat until the balance shown in breadwallet/greenbits is what you expected
* Wait until your HW Wallet/Trezor arrives

And this is relevant why? Nobody is arguing that it is possible to create illegal content. The amount of time that takes isn't important. The fact that you actively and willingly have to create it out of otherwise random data is the point here. If you don't make that distinction, possession of every and all data is illegal.
Sooner or later some legal authority will comment on this, and then we will have clarity. My feeling is, that his can be argued back and forth until the cows come home.

You could create a throwaway seed and try out what happens, if you use the 24-word-seed+passphrase in Electrum. If both generate the same addresses, you've got your fallback option in case Trezor goes bankrupt or whatever right there. Electrum isn't SegWit-enabled yet, tough. So make sure you're setting the throwaway seed up with normal bitcoin-addresses.

This doesn't store the private key on a server. Doing what you recommend and creating a paper wallet using bitaddress or similar websites is exactly the same. You're downloading code and generating keys and addresses with it offline. Only because one is JS code and the other is Python code, doesn't mean one is more secure than the other.

Electrum, but from [Tails]( with all network capability disabled. Zero chance of key leakage, still full control.
If that's technically impossible to you, buy a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger Nano S.
Don't trust others with your bitcoin. If you did before the Bcash fork, you missed out on a 10% increase in your BTC holdings, by cashing out Bcash for BTC, because Coinbase won't release their customers Bcash until Jan 2018 for "technical reason".

Basically yes. If you plan on holding long term and maybe larger amounts, a cold storage setup is recommended.

Similar to creating a cold storage paper wallet as described [here]( you can follow the same procedure and use the "Wallet Details" tab. Enter the private key there, enter the password and see if the address that is generated matches the one holding your bitcoin.
Because it's done offline, there's no need to retire that private key.

* You had malware on the computer on which you used the Blockchain.info-wallet.

If I understand him correctly, because lot of the money is not available for transacting in the first place. He mentions that after the 2007/2008 crash, the velocity came down hard. The dollars in circulation are moving fast, but a lot of dollars aren't in circulation. I think that's also the reason, why although inflation was *insane*, like 90 degree upwards insane, the effects for consumer products weren't that strong. 
Transaction demand is very low in bitcoin now anyway. That's why everybody likes to bitch about high txn-fees, but it actually doesn't matter that much.

You don't transfer private keys from Mycelium to your Ledger. Just send them over to one of the addresses of your Ledger. After the Mycelium wallet is emptied out, you can use [ElectronCash]( to access your BCH. Just install it on your PC and when setting up the wallet, enter the Mycelium seed. It goes without saying, that after doing so, you should retire/archive this seed. 
To exchange BCH for BTC, I recommend [HitBTC.com](

What bitcoin changes is the way banks operate. In a fiat-paper-money system with a central bank, banks engage in fractional reserve banking. They lend out much more money than they actually have on reserve, knowing that if they aren't able to fulfill their obligations to their creditors (their customers), they'll get paper-money shipments from the central bank.
Using gold, this wouldn't be possible, because the central bank can't produce gold at will. The overly indebted bank simply would go bankrupt, as it should.
Unfortunately, gold being physical introduces central points of failure.
This is where bitcoin comes in.
It is the ultimate hard money and entry into the banking sector under the bitcoin standard is free. No central point of failure, no central bank perverse incentives, cryptographic provable solvency i.e. no fractional reserve banking, except if the customers explicitly agree to the terms, etc.
In other words: Bitcoin eliminates central banks and international settlement. This is why the BIF and IMF, the FED and the ECB will be most threatened by it.
Commercial banks, payment processors like PayPal, Visa, ... , and other free market services in the banking and finance sector will do just fine under the bitcoin standard. They'll face more competition, due to easier market entry, but their services aren't obsolete.

Of course I order pizza online. But you know what? Pizza places tell you to which locations they deliver based on the time it takes to reach them. So if I live in Salzburg, I won't order pizza from a place in Amsterdam.
Same goes here, or for Amazon: They deliver to all of Europe, probably from a central warehouse. Perishable food is just not happening with this kind of logistics. But that doesn't mean that it's not useful. If the price is right and delivery doesn't add too much, maybe I'm going to order all my household articles from Edeka from now on.

The flaw in your logic is, that the amount a person earns is arbitrary and can be set as low or as high as anybody wishes. As if it was up to the employer, how much the employees earn. If he gives them much money, he's a nice guy, if he gives them little money, he's a meany.
That's completely wrong. A worker earns roughly what he produces, minus the time-discount for not having to first invest heavily into, for example a burger restaurant.
For example, if the worker flips burgers and produces burgers that net the owner of the burger restaurant $10/h in profit, and the employer pays the employee only $5/h, one of the burger restaurants competitors will bid more for the burger-flippers labor, say $6/h. This repeats, until the burger-flipper roughly earns what he produces.
If a politician comes in and mandates that every person has to earn $15/h, but the burger-flipper only produces $10/h of profit, the employer loses $5 for every hour the employee works there. Even if he is his nephew or whatever and he really doesn't want to fire him, he'll have to sooner or later. Instead he will invest in machines and automation.
So no, an increase in the minimum wage doesn't increase inflation, it only increases unemployment.

No, it's the other way around. He has 3 chunks which are in order, with 4 words in each chunk, which are out of order.
Sort of like if the seed is
`A B C D E F G H I J K L`,
what he has is
`B C D A` `F G E H` `J I L K`.
So there are `4! = 24` combinations per chunk. My intuition tells me, that's equivalent of having an alphabet of 24 symbols and a word of length 3, which results in `24^3 = 13824` combinations.
If OP has at least one address that comes from the seed, this is a really nice programming exercise. Write a python script, which calculates every possible seed combination, tries if the address is produced and stop if it does.

Everybody knows bitcoin is volatile. The market cap is still tiny compared to gold or even certain stocks like Apple Inc. If you're holding bitcoin for 1 or 2 years and progressively increase your holdings over time, that volatility doesn't matter though. For example, if I trade BTC right now for goods or services, I'm effectively canceling out the amount I acquired in November or December. On long enough time frames, short term volatility is just statistical noise on top of the growth curve of your holdings.

One doesn't beget the other. There's difference between a deposit account and a checking account in a full-reserve economy. You can't spend from a deposit account until maturity. However, if you need the money before that, you can sell it on the open market, for a discount of course.

You can use any wallet using the same derivation path as Jaxx to see if the xpub-key generates any addresses that hold a balance. Mycelium should work.

If you are indeed using the same exact recovery words and the wallet synced successfully, you will see the correct balance.
If you don't see the correct balance, you did not use the same recovery words. You must have them confused.
However, there is one mistake people make when dealing with BTC and BCH at the same time. They send BTC to a BCH address (or vice versa).
Using the  site, you can check the first few BTC *and* BCH addresses in a blockexplorer.
For BTC you can use blockchain.info.
For BCH you can use 
The BTC derivation path that the iancoleman-tool uses is by default the same as Jaxx uses, namely m/44'/0'/0'/0.
To see if you accidentally sent your BTC to a BCH address, change the Coin to BCH (3 fields beneath where you type the seed in) and choose under the section "Derived Addresses" the option "Use legacy addresses for Bitcoin Cash (ie starting with '1')".
Check the first few addresses in a BTC blockexplorer.
If there's a balance, just sweep the private key into a BTC wallet.
If there isn't, you probably made the first mistake: using the wrong seed. If you don't have the seed, the balance is gone.

The paper wallet is then as secure as the device to which you exposed its private key to. 
If that device is an iOS device and the app you used to sweep was breadwallet, or if it's an Android device and the app is Greenbits or Mycelium (which actually imports the key instead of sweeping), I would still use it for smaller amounts. 
But if you go through the hassle of creating a cold storage paper wallet, why not create *lots* of paper wallets?

Kraken is good for relatively large sums. Get your Tier 4 verification. I had the Tier 3 which allows one to deposit/withdraw a relatively low amount (although much more than the $2k at Coinbase).
I let Kraken do the Bitcoin/Bcash split for me and thanks to the free bitcoins I got for cashing out Bcash for BTC, and the rise in price, I got "slightly" above the Tier 3 limit, which would have taken me months to withdraw everything back to my own cold storage wallet.
So I wrote them to please bump me up to Tier 4 because I don't want to wait a month to withdraw my bitcoins and they did that pretty much the next day.
They want to make money after all. So register, jump through all the regulatory hoops and then buy a little within our limit to test the waters and then write them to bump you up to Tier 4, because you want to go in big.

A sign of autism is when people take everything literally, even with things common sense dictates aren't meant to be taken literally.
So when I say "zero chance of key leakage", it doesn't actually mean a probability of mathematically zero to leak your keys. It means "a very low, practically negligible chance, of key leakage." 
A typical situation of taking something literally that has a different message embedded in it, which is unreadable to autistic people, would be something like "Hey, since you're already up, can you get me a drink from the kitchen?" and the autistic person would respond with "Yes." without a drink. Because technically, the person asked if he *can* get him a drink. And of course he can, he's quite sure of that. The person who wanted a drink should have said: "Please bring me a drink from the kitchen." because now the actual words and message are in unison.

I was mentioning gold, because it does what you are describing the best possible way: if the demand for money rises, more money is produced. That's because the discounted marginal revenue product of gold mining is non-zero. With bitcoin, it is zero.
The problem with what you (and the monetarists) propose, is determining in real time or even for the future, what the demand of money is/will be in order to carry out the money increase/decrease phase.
Because the market is unpredictable, this is inherently impossible. It's in a way, central planning of the money supply. Why central planning doesn't work is clear since Mises explained it with the economic calculation problem.

So you want an unaccountable 3rd party to be in charge of the money. That's great, because we have that. But not everybody wants that. I'm also pretty sure, that almost everybody who wants immutability is aware of the risk that comes with that. I'm not sure the opposite is true.


Okay, if you think so. I think writing into a global, trustless, censorship resistant database is a pretty useful. 


Read again what I wrote. I wrote: you have the option to treat bitcoin as you would cash or gold. Judging from your comment about "selling a usb with some bitcoin on it", your understanding of how the bitcoin network works is very limited. No wonder you don't understand the point.


Who said bitcoin has to replace fiat, gold, etc. over night? Of course the different systems will operate in parallel for many years. 


Again, I have not the time to educate you on economic theory. If you want to know why the concept of intrinsic value is wrong, read up on "subjective value theory".
If you have points that I can't read in any old mainstream Keynesian influenced commentary written by some old guy who barley grasps e-mail, please let me know, but so far you didn't bring anything to the table that hasn't been discussed 1 million times ever since bitcoin was worth $0.01.

Blockchain wallet is maintained by company openly hostile to bitcoin. They want to push bcash aka bitcoin cash. You will have to wait until the cows come home to see SegWit or any other future feature of bitcoin in the blockchain wallet.
If you research their history, you'll also find that they had a ton of security flaws in the past. I wouldn't trust it.
BRD, formally known as breadwallet, absolutely went to shit the past year. Before that, it was my favorite wallet for iOS. It was clean, fast, easy to use and very secure. It utilized all security features the iOS platform offers.
But then they started pushing their own scam-token to make a quick buck and focused mostly on gimmicky UI stuff. They have horrible fee estimation, as far as I know no custom fees and like blockchain, SegWit will take probably until forever.
The options for iOS are slim.
GreenAddress like someone already mentioned has at least SegWit and custom fees, but to be honest, the UI sucks.
I like Coinomi, which is now available on iOS, but it's not open source.
I would use at least two wallets: Electrum in a cold storage setup like this:

You can try the following:

* 3: Send your whole bitcoin balance to your new breadwallet installation and wait for at least 1 or 2 confirmations.
* 4: Now install ElectronCash on your Mac or PC: 
* 5: When opening ElectronCash, use the Blockchain.info-recovery seed to "restore" the wallet. You should now see the same balance you initially had in bitcoin, but it's now your Bcash balance. Apparently this works for Mycelium and I think Blockchain.info uses the same derivation path.
* 6: You can exchange Bcash for Bitcoin using HitBTC.com or ShapeShift.io.

One thing Multi-Sig-protocols like Glacier are superior in, is that you aren't as susceptible to physical attacks. If you have a Trezor laying around at home, thugs breaking in can take it and torture you until you give up the PIN. Of course there are decoy wallets and all that, but it would be even better, if you couldn't even get to the money physically. That's one reason, why bank robberies are so rare these days: the banks simply don't have a lot of cash in the branches.
So having something like a 2-of-4 Glacier setup, with one key at your home, one in a bank safe deposit box, another in another safe deposit box and the last one with your lawyer, or something like that, is probably a good idea.
I have read the Glacier protocol numerous times and I like the overall security measurements, but I'm skeptical to screwing something up, especially when spending and having funds go to change-addresses.
I'd rather do an adapted version of the Glacier protocol, using Electrum instead of single private keys.
For one, Electrum seeds are easier to write down. And, more importantly to me, handling transactions, signatures and the change-amounts is done automatically.

No, not really. The most effective way to slow down bitcoin adoption would be for a nuclear sovereign to have a 100% gold backed currency, abolishing all KYC/AML legislation and allow anonymous transactions. Even in this scenario, which is well into fantasy-land, bitcoin would still be better, because it's inflation rate is actually lower than gold (beginning in June 2020) and it doesn't have counter-party risk. But such a sound gold money would be good enough to push bitcoin into a niche market.

Satoshi Nakamoto would know what to do, to instantly and undoubtedly prove that he is, who he is. 
He would sign an unpredictable message, using the private key of the address the coinbase transaction of the genesis block went to.
Something like this:


using the private key of address 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa.
And because it is so obvious and easy for Satoshi to prove his identity, and impossible for anybody else, it is absolutely reasonable to dismiss every claim of being Satoshi without that prove outright.

* finding a solution is Poisson distributed, i.e. it's statistically measurable to find a solution within a certain time frame, or at least, the probability to find a solution increases the more time/work has been expended. (that's so the block time is constant over a large enough sample size)

They might, or they might not. You can't know for sure, that means you can't trust them.
Don't you see their internal contradiction?
They won't release Btrash-tokens to its customers for almost half a year (August 2017 to January 2018), although Btrash, for all its flaws, has replay protection and most other exchanges were able to release and trade them very shortly after the fork?
But then they are "as fast as possible" releasing B2X-tokens?
If I had Btrash-tokens in Coinbase, I'd lawyer up and sue the shit out of them for damages, considering that the price went down considerably over the last few days/weeks.
How could they possibly make the case, that releasing Btrash, which has replay protection and that many other exchanges releases very shortly after the fork, is impossible, but B2X will work like clockwork?
They either are maliciously withholding Btrash, or are recklessly releasing B2X.

Depending on the devices you have, I would separate the wallet you receive payments to from the device that holds your private keys.
For example, if you own an Android tablet and an Android smartphone, install Mycelium on both devices but import a few public addresses from the tablet into the smartphone.

Think of miners as a service provider. They create blocks by demonstrably using energy.
Once a block is found, it is validated by the network, i.e. everybody who's running full-node.
The block can be either valid, and gets thus incorporated into the blockchain, or invalid and it gets discarded, effectively wasting the miners resources.
Mining an invalid block, even with 99% hash-rate, is just a waste of the miners resources. The network doesn't care.

Pretty good, tbh. Been hodling since 2012. Judging by your hyper-emotional writings, my guess is this is your first rodeo?

Hodling simply means for me, know yourself. I know I'm bad at calling high or lows, so I simply use bitcoin as a savings account and if I need the money, I sell a little bit. Because the overall trend is upwards, short term price decreases don't matter really.
Btw, I also bought very near the ATH of 2013 and held "expensive bitcoins" through a 1 year+ bear market.

You have a complete misunderstanding of how the banking system works.
It is very important to understand the difference between a credit account and a deposit account. 99.9999% of all accounts today are credit accounts, meaning that as soon as you deposit your money in the bank, it gets loaned out.
The balance in your account, which is a credit account, is not USD, it's money-substitute and is only valued in a 1:1 ratio to the USD, as long as all other banks that accept payments from your bank believe, that the bank is liquid. As soon as this belief vanishes, like in a crises or bank-run, the balance in your account is worth zero USD. Compare that to cash, which is always worth 1:1 to the USD.
A company that actually does deposit bank accounts is GoldMoney. They store actual physical USD bank notes in vaults and you can transfer property title of them via electronic payments. So you have the money USD (or Gold, or Bitcoin) and you are transacting using the "currency" GoldMoney-payments.
If you want to see LN in a banking analogy, this is it. It's not a perfect analogy, because in bitcoin the money is the currency and vice-versa, but it comes closest. LN transactions are bitcoin transactions, they are simply not settled yet, but in contrast to zero-conf transactions, a smart-contract between the transacting parties minimizes the risk between the parties.
**Edit:** I think the confusion comes from the fact, that many people imagine "having bitcoins" is something like owning a physical thing. Having the bitcoin-transaction on-chain is then being in possession of those bitcoins. Although that's a nice metaphor, it's actually not correct. "Having bitcoins" actually means "I can fulfill the conditions of this smart-contract as recorded on the blockchain". The condition unusually is proving ownership over a specific private key, but there can be many others, like in multi-sig-arrangements. LN transaction do the same thing. They too operate on a smart-contract recorded on the blockchain.

Sure it would. The price is where supply meets demand. It doesn't matter if you exchange btc for usd, or usd for cheese cakes, or cheese cakes for btc. The price of btc relative to cheese cakes depends on how many btc are competing for how many cheese cakes. If you hord your btc, fewer btc compete for cheese cakes, making cheese cakes more expensive relative to btc, i.e. the price of btc (relative to cheese cakes) increased. If btc is hodled generally the price generally increases.

Exodus is one of the worst/most insecure wallets out there.
If you know what you're doing, get a cold storage solution. For example Electrum (electrum.org) on a permanently air gapped computer + Electrum with only the master public key on an Android device makes spending from cold storage really convenient. 
Or get a Trezor (trezor.io).

That's a great idea and you don't even have to install Electrum in Tails, because it comes preinstalled.


Yes. **EDIT:** you could write "Electrum + what version you used" also on the paper, if you might forget about the exact software you used and then in 10 years wonder, what to do with these strange words.


No. You can save the master public key in order to import it into an online installation of Electrum, so you can see your addresses and create unsigned transactions. You can then save these unsigned transactions on a USB thumb drive, boot Tails offline, put in your seed, sign that unsinged transaction, save it to the USB thumb drive again and then broadcast it from the online installation of Electrum. That way you never expose your seed/private keys to the Internet but still have the ability to send and receive bitcoins and see your transaction history.


You can save one or many addresses in a text-file to a USB thumb drive and just keep sending bitcoins to them. It would be more elegant, tough, to do what I wrote above, to import the master public key into an online installation of Electrum.


That's a matter of taste. I personally like the offline signing routine of Electrum. The cold storage wallet is more like a long term savings account anyway so I very rarely send from it. In addition to this "savings account", I also have a wallet in the more traditional sense, from which I spend more frequently and that holds not that much money. For that I use Mycelium on my Android phone. (On iOS I would use Breadwallet.)
You might also look into securing the seed better, against theft, fire etc. Look into Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme ( which allows you to split data like a seed into m-of-n splits, for example a 2-of-3 split. The data is mathematically arranged, so that any 2 of the 3 parts recreate the whole, but one by itself doesn't reveal any information. You could then store the parts in secure but independent locations, so for example if your house burns down, the other two parts are in a safe deposit box and your moms house. Or if you moms house gets robbed, you can get the other two parts from your house and the safe deposit box, recreate the seed and send everything to a new wallet, just to be secure.

Totally possible. Just like computers in general, maybe highly efficient miners will be found in every house hold. And yes, it basically works like a lottery then, but it also works like a lottery now. The mining power one invests is like the number of tickets one buys. The more tickets you buy, the higher the chance for you to win the lottery. The more hashes you compute per second, the higher the chance for you to find the next block. There is a difference tough: The number of hashes per second overall determines the probability of finding a new block, which averages the block time to 10 minutes. In a conventional lottery, the number of tickets sold doesn't change the probability of winning the jackpot. That's why there's no "block time" in lotteries and sometimes there's a double or triple jackpot.
TL;DR: Miners in most house holds is more or less the equivalent of a lottery and the ideal scenario for the bitcoin ecosystem.

Central planning of the EUDSSR at its best!
Those god damned bureaucrats think that the fees are just arbitrary numbers, but they are not. They are a function of the operational costs of banks and the risks involved with CC. My prediction is, if CC companies have to lower the fees to 0.2% per transaction, they will have to charge the customers the rest some other way. Maybe via a monthly fee or anything else.
Think about it: If Bureaucrat Bob thinks he can make a CC company operate on 0.2% fee, why doesn't he start such a company and undercut every other competitor. Within a year he would have market dominance and billions in his bank account.
This whole scheme is only good for making Average Joe think that the EU helps him and to make CC companies bribe, I mean, lobby, the commissars more.

Decades of of engineering experience, huh? Alright, let me do the math:
Lets say you have 100 cryptographically secure hashing algorithms and to compute one final hash, you have to use all of them in a randomized sequence.
That means, I have to build 100 different ASICs and put them on a matrix to access them in any order I wish to. Assuming that over time the efficiency of ASICs for any algorithm approaches that of current ASIC miners for sha256, that means that I get approximately 1/100th the hashes I currently get from an AntMiner S9, for the same amount of energy I have to use. According to [1] an AntMiner S9 produces approximately 10'000 MHashes/J, but now I have to use 100 ASICs, so I get 100 MHashes/J.
Compare that to current GPUs [2], which don't even achieve 5 MHashes/J.
In other words, even if you had 100 cryptographically secure hashing algorithms, which you don't, and one would use the most naive approach to build ASICs, i.e. one at a time, not one giant chip which is more plausible, ASICs are still more than 100 times more efficient. Don't forget you add motherboards and other hardware that you need to run GPUs, but don't to run ASICs. 
Taking all that into consideration, ASICs will be orders or magnitude more efficient, than general purpose CPU or GPUs.

* Especially if you store the encrypted file in the cloud (Gmail, Google Drive, Dropbox,...), you don't have to advertise it being a potentially very valuable bitcoin wallet.

I'd go with a secure smart device like an Android or iOS smartphone or tablet with Mycelium or Breadwallet. Both are available for both platforms. Secure the recovery seed on paper. A dedicated device, like an old phone or so, that you factory reset before installing the wallet would be preferable, but if you have discipline and don't install every crap app that comes your way, your main device should be good to go too.
Electrum on a general purpose computer is of course also possible, but these platforms, Windows, MacOS and even Linux, are inherently more insecure than Android and iOS.

Here's a cool method to create an endless supply of cold storage paper wallets.
You need two USB thumb drives, and dice.
* Create a 12 word dice ware passphrase, example: `friar audit racy jolt wordy ret taffy clip study flit finch nitty` 
* Write that passphrase on a piece of paper
* Create a Live USB installation of Ubuntu Linux on your first USB thumb drive: 
* Then download the bitaddress.org-ZIP-File and save it to the 2nd USB thumb drive: 
* Disconnect your computer and reboot into the Live Ubuntu Linux.
* Plug in the 2nd USB thumb drive and extract the ZIP-file
* Open the HTML-file and go to the "Brain Wallet" tab
* Type the diceware passphrase verbatim into the Passphrase field of the Brain Wallet tab and append once at a time `-1`, `-2`, `...`, `-N` to create `N` paper wallets. For example using the passphrase from above, the passphrase with `-1` appended creates the address `1GgD2BTGejs1jUpe4CpT9eEd4ybysscxJD`, `-7` creates the address `144aZPGYcXkzfgFRqZF8SYauCXMDyn7i6w`.
* Create as many address/key-pairs as you want and copy and paste the *addresses* as well as their index-number into a text-file and save it on the USB thumb drive that you used to store the bitaddress-ZIP-file on. Don't copy the keys, only the addresses. So for example: `1 -&gt; 1GgD2BTGejs1jUpe4CpT9eEd4ybysscxJD`, `...`, `7 -&gt; 144aZPGYcXkzfgFRqZF8SYauCXMDyn7i6w`.
* Now you can reboot into your regular operating system and start sending bitcoins to the addresses you created. You can monitor their balance and generate the QR-codes for convenience by using 
* If you want to spend from one or more of the addresses, repeat the process, create their private keys, import them into for example Mycelium or Electrum, send whatever amount you want to send and then send the rest to an unused cold address, because the one you used isn't cold anymore.
* Store the passphrase securely, memorizing it doesn't hurt either.

Put the core client archive file for Linux and your CPU architecture (most probably x86_64) on a second USB thumb drive.
Boot up an offline system, for example using Ubuntu with [Unetbootin]( on a USB thumb drive.
Open the second USB thumb drive, extract the bitcoin core wallet and start it up. A new wallet.dat file will be generated.
Encrypt the wallet.dat using the built in feature of the core wallet. Use a strong password for that and write it on paper. [1] [2] [3] [4]
Display a few addresses and copy/paste them into a text-file that you store on the second USB thumb drive.
Copy the encrypted wallet.dat file there too.
To be double sure, it doesn't hurt do dump the wallet into a textfile using the `dumpwallet` command and printing that out. If you use the current version of the core client, you'll see an extended private key, starting with `xprv...` in it. From it all keys and addresses can be restored in the future. So having that on paper somewhere secure isn't a bad idea.
You could also copy the encrypted wallet.dat file additionally on a CD-R, a second USB drive, your smartphone, and so on, to prevent data rot, i.e. the file corrupting over time.
If the wallet.dat is indeed encrypted with a very strong password (128-bits of entropy or more), you can even place it on your online-computer to monitor the balance of the addresses you've already generated.

If you have your BTC in a wallet to which you can access the private keys, you have all the time in the world, assuming that BCH isn't dead on arrival.
When you want to actually access your BCH, first send your BTC from your regular BTC wallet to a brand new address. Then import that private key that up until then held your BTC into a BCH compatible wallet, of which BitcoinABC is the only one I know and send them again to a brand new BCH compatible wallet, i.e. to an address of your BitcoinABC wallet.dat. This transaction will be recorded in the BCH branch of the blockchain and your coins are split.

@_date: 2017-07-12 21:15:58
I'm obviously not OP, but I'll try my best. u/dtuur is referring to Rothbard, an Austrian School economist and is criticizing Buterin's claim, that in PoW the cost of an attack is always identical to the cost of the defense.
Here is why it's false: It is an *a priori truth*, that the value of something in the hands of person A, for example the value of the resources used to defend against the attack (electricity, silicone, labor, land, etc.) is different from value of the same resources in the hands of person B.
Why is this a priori true, i.e. why must we presume that it is true? Think about a simple trade between Alice who has an apple and Bob who has a banana. Alice and Bob decide to trade. Why would they do that? Only if Alice perceives the banana to be more valuable to her than the apple, and vice versa for Bob, who perceives the Apple to be more valuable than the banana (this is called "subjective value theory" and is a corner stone of the Austrian School). If it weren't the case, then at least one of the two would think to be worse off after the trade and wouldn't engage in it. Even if they perceive the relative value of the apple and the banana to be equal, they wouldn't do the trade, because the relative gain from the trade has to discount the uncertainty inherent in any trade, for example the apple may be rotten inside.
So, if person A uses X amount of resources to attack bitcoin and person B uses the same X amount of resources to defend, it does not follow, that therefore the cost to defend and attack is 1:1, like Buterin says.
Add to that, that the cost of doing something is not only the dollar amount you have to spend to do that. You also have to add to the cost the revenue you could have had, if you did something else.
For example: The resources to attack bitcoin (electricity, silicone, labor, land,...) could have been used to render an animated movie and sell it on the market. So if you spend 100 million in resources thinking you can gain 110 million USD worth by attacking bitcoin, but you could have made 120 million USD rendering the movie, the total cost of attacking bitcoin isn't 100 million (the initial resources you have to buy anyway), but 100 million plus the 10 million in foregone income. So you aren't profiting in the end.
The cost of all the stuff you *don't* do because you do something, is called "opportunity cost". By reading this, you incur opportunity cost, because you could also go for a walk, read a book, watch a movie etc. You forego all that, to read this.
A comprehensive textbook on the basics of the Austrian School of Economics is "Man, Economy and State" by Murray Rothbard, which u/dtuur referred to. It is freely available from the Mises Institute:

I don't know how you would access your Bitcoin Cash (BCH) coins from breadwallet, if you desire to do so.
To minimize difficulty, you could send the breadwallet balance to a paper wallet with a single address/key pair. After the fork, you can then import that key first into a BTC wallet and send back to your breadwallet and then import the key again into a BCH wallet and send to a new dedicated BCH wallet, or cash it out. (or vice versa, if you prefer BCH over BTC).

I think you did, because exchanges existed and do exist without those friction inducing regulations. Thus making the regulations a priori unnecessary.
That doesn't mean that exchanges won't employ some measures to counter fraud, but it does mean, that the government regulations cause frictions to the disadvantage of the customer.
Ergo, the government causes high-friction exchanges, not the criminals, because low friction exchanges existed and exist without those regulations.
If you deny that the government causes high-friction, which you did, you have to show that there are no low friction exchanges in unregulated environments.
The non-existence of low-friction unregulated exchanges *implies* that counter measures to the degree the government imposes are necessary and wouldn't be employed by the exchanges themselves.

You could use the Split Wallet feature of bitaddress.org. It creates a 2-of-3 shamirs secret sharing scheme of a single bitcoin private key.
Any two of the three splits recreates the whole key.
You could use such a key as the passphrase to an encrypted 7-Zip archive containing a text file with your seed. Then store that 7zip file in Google Drive, burn it 1000 times to a CD-R, put it on a USB thumb drive 1000 times and so on.

That's not ASIC *resistant*. Once it's valuable to produce ASICs for that algorithm, it will be done and because the [discounted marginal revenue product]( of additional hashing-power in bitcoin approaches zero very quickly, it will be valuable to build ASICs for whatever algorithm is used.

Nothing is ASIC resistant. It's purely a matter of efficiency to write a program in code that is then executed on a general purpose CPU, to write a program in silicone (i.e. produce an ASIC), or to build a mechanical machine. 
A program, an algorithm, whatever you want to call it, is a logical construct that can be realized in any way you like. You can execute it on paper by hand, you can execute it on a CPU by electrical charge, you can execute it with marbles rolling down an elaborate system of tubes, or you can build an integrated circuit.
Sooner or later, no matter what algorithm (and concatenating many algorithms is just another algorithm) you use, if it's more efficient to re-write them in silicone, you've got an ASIC. 
u/luke-jr is absolutely right to think, that ASICs are inevitable and the only viable defense against ASIC supported centralization, is an economic one, by turning ASIC farms into expensive heaters when miners start gaming the system.

Wut? If I understand you correctly, you want to construct a set of algorithms that can only be computed on a Turing complete machine. We have that. That's called a programming language.

Coinbase is all over the place with numbers. Being in Europe, we use a comma for decimal numbers, like `3 and one quarter Euros` is €3,25 not €3.25, while the dot is used to indicate 1000, like 1.000 is one thousand, 20.000 is twenty thousand etc.
So when sending bitcoins Coinbase lets you click on the amount to spend everything emptying out the wallet, this fills in 1,125 BTC if you have 1 1/8 BTC and then throws an Error telling you, that you don't have 1125 BTC, as in one thousand one hundred twenty five, because from the filling to the sending part, Coinbase switches from the European notation to the Anglo/American notation.

Trezor ( Works with Mycelium (Android) and Electrum (only get it from  or the Google Play Store  . Every other source must be regarded as malware.)

You can look at  to get feeling of how high the fee should be, when you send the transaction.
For Android, Mycelium is definitley a solid choice.
The seed per se is not a private key. The private keys are derived from it, that's why all you need to backup your wallet, is to write those 12 words down on paper and secure it.
To get to your Bcash coins, you'll need to get to the private keys themselves to import them later after the fork into a Bcash wallet.
I don't know how easy it is, to get the private keys directly from Mycelium.
It would definitely be easier using a single address/key paper wallet, for example generated using bitaddress.org. Or Electrum, which has a feature to export the private keys.
The problem with that is that you'll be using your general desktop/laptop computer, which might be more insecure than your smartphone.
Ideally, you'd generate a paper wallet offline. Or you could try using bitaddress.org from your smartphone.

This is the easiest method I can think of:
* Buy a nice box that can be locked, with a distinctive mark. Like giant yellow flower on the lid.
* Encrypt your seed symmetrically using GPG and ASCII-armor it.
* Print the encrypted ASCII-armored seed on paper. This is the fallback version, should the digital copies on the USB thumb drive and the CD-R fail.
* Burn the encrypted seed 1000 times on a CD-R.
* Copy the encrypted seed 1000 times on a USB thumb drive.
* Also write down on a piece of paper the SHA256-checksum of the encrypted seed.
* Write the password you used for the encryption on paper, put it in an envelope with instructions to open the box that they will receive once you're dead in it.
* Also store the password somewhere you can access it, like in a safe deposit box.
* Write instructions on how to decrypt and use the seed on paper and put it also into the box.
* Give that envelope to your relative who you want to be the heir of your bitcoins and tell them to only open it after you're dead.
* Write your will and state that you want that person to be the heir of the box with the giant yellow flower.
* Continue your jam session with Jesus and Jimmy Hendrix in heaven.
Look, I created a test-seed and encrypted it with the password `abc123`. Even if the digital copies fail, typing this in isn't too hard:
If you on a later date change how you store your bitcoins, you can do so. Just update instructions and encrypt the new seed/private key.

This is a bad idea. What do you mean, access it them at any time? I hope you are not talking about unlocking your online wallet at any malware infested public library computer that comes your way.
The way I see it, there is no substitute for the strategy of different tiers of bitcoin wallet. Here is how I do it:
**Tier 0 - Long time storage**
This is cold storage. I employ [Electrum]( for that.
**Tier 1 - Spending wallet**
This is not cold storage and only holds as much money as I usually would be comfortable carrying around in my fiat-wallet too. Here I use [Mycelium]( on my Android^tm smartphone.
**Tier 3 - Online wallet/3^rd party wallet**
This is every exchange or other service that holds the private keys for my bitcoins for me. Exchanges like bitstamp.net, or the tipping service changetip.com. Here I have only the bare minimum that I absolutely have to have there. Usually it's zero, as I immediately withdraw my bitcoins either to my Tier 0 or 1 wallet, as soon as I buy them.
The private keys/seeds must never touch untrustworthy devices. For the seed of my cold storage Electrum setup, that means any system that is or ever was connected to the Internet.
My Mycelium-Seed only is stored along my cold storage seed and on my smartphone. I would never type it into someone else' smartphone or computer.
And logging in on my Tier 3 accounts is always secured by 2FA, strong and individual passwords (I use a [passwordmanager]( and only done on trustworthy systems.

ASICs aren't inherently bad. The nice thing about them, is that they are useless for everything else which makes it economically more costly to attack Bitcoin.
The opportunity cost, i.e. the foregone income you could have had if you used your mining-farm for something else, is higher for GPUs than for ASICs, because you can actually do something different with GPUs than mine bitcoins. The incentive to switch away from mining bitcoin is thus higher, if you use GPUs or CPUs. For example someone might pay you better for doing weather forecast simulations on your GPU-mining-farm.
Another reason why ASICs are actually good is if you view mining hardware like capital goods in a market economy. Some are further from the consumer than others and those are not as susceptible to consumer preference.
For example, in order to produce ice cream, you have to have an ice cream machine, in order to have an ice cream machine, you need a truck that transports it to the shop. To have a truck, you have to have a truck factory and so on all the way back to natural resources, i.e. iron ore in a mine.
If you buy an ice cream machine and consumers suddenly don't want ice cream any more, you can't use it for anything else. You are very much exposed to losing your investment. If you run the iron ore mine, you don't care about the ice cream market. If consumers switch to hot dogs, it doesn't matter for you, people still need iron.
ASICs are like the ice cream machine, while CPUs and GPUs are more like the iron ore mine. Attacking, or simply not defending, bitcoin is economically much more advantageous when your hardware investment doesn't depend on being used to mine bitcoin.
So on all in all, I absolutely welcome ASICs, but the network has to be ready to switch algorithms from time to time, when the economic incentives of miners, users and exchanges aren't aligned anymore.

These wallets, especially Electrum are fine. Very established, highly regarded. It really comes down to you having your computer security in check.
Regarding forks: yes, you'll be fine if you hold your bitcoins yourself before a split happens, should it happen.
I would prefer Electrum over Greenaddress, tough, because I think it's easier to switch servers (i.e. looking up different forks of the blockchain) with Electrum.
If you want to be super secure, use Electrum in a cold storage setup.
In any case, make sure you have your recovery seed backed up before you send any bitcoins to the wallet. Writing it down on paper and storing it with important documents, like your birth certificate is generally a good idea, if you ask me. The digital wallet on the computer itself should be encrypted using a strong password. [1] [2] [3] [4]

If you want it 100% irreversible, even in possible future versions of blockchain pruning, where empty addresses get thrown out, you should directly produce the address. This means the private key can never be known and thus the address can never be zero, once you sent some satoshis to it. Of course that means, they are lost forever, but who cares if it's only 1/1000 of a cent or something like that.
This is a rather easy way to timestamp the file `document.txt` for eternity:
* `openssl rmd160 document.txt`
* Copy the hash, for example `580242d012b11c21d9090ea211483282b65816a5`
* Paste the hash into the search field of 
* This produces the corresponding address, in this case `192MAygRxXhtCpBUvZZ9k6vqc838bEzBcx`
* Send satoshis to that address
* The End

Do you even know what "Turing complete" means? If "the sum of the algorithms" produces something that's Turing complete, you've got a programming language. Great, now what? Which Turing *program* do you now want to run on this Turing complete set of instructions? Oh, franken-hash. Good.
There is a difference between a Turing machine and a Turing program.
What you are trying to do with your franken-algo, is produce a Turing machine, which can indeed only run on another Turing machine, i.e. a CPU.
But that's not what we need to perform PoW. We need a specific *program* to be executed. And once it's established which program it is, we don't need Turing completeness anymore, we can build a machine doing only that, an ASIC.

No, that's still one algorithm. `sha256(sha512(ripemd160(sha1(md5(sha3(STUFF))))))` is nothing but one giant program and can be executed however you like, lets call it `Hulk1(STUFF)`. If there is an economic edge to be had by building specialized hardware for `Hulk1`, which there is, because more hashing power yields more bitcoins, then someone will implement `Hulk1` directly in hardware. 
Let's call the first permutation of `Hulk1()` `Hulk2()`, the second `Hulk3()`, ..., to `Hulk720()`. So even if you randomize the order of the algorithms, all you get is something I'm going to call `SuperHulk()`, which is all 720 permutations of `Hulk1()` and which is larger than `Hulk1()`, but being a program, still implementable in whatever form you like. Here are a few Turing machines in various forms: [Wood]( [Knex]( [Lego]( That's your CPU. But you could build simpler versions of these machines that are not capable of running *every* program, but only, let's say `Hulk5()`. Now you have the equivalent of an ASIC.


Now I see where you are having a mistake in your understanding of theoretical computer science: You think that an array of different hashing-algorithms requires Turing complete machines. 
No matter what the set of algos you chose is, it is finite which means having specialized hardware for it always has an economic advantage over having hardware that could run any code, i.e. an infinite set of algos, but will run only the 6 algos you use for mining.

I can't speak to the Ledger from personal experience, because I don't have one.

Please point to a paper that demonstrates how one can "sum algos into Turing completeness". So far, what you are writing is so detached from reality, [it's not even wrong](


No I'm not. If you knew beforehand that all you ever wanted to do with your GPU is using one specific set of algorithms for, lets say, ray tracing, then yes, it would be more efficient to build ASICs for exactly that task. But usually people want to compute different stuff at different times, especially in GPU clusters.
The reason why people use GPU over ASICs is because they don't want to limit themselves to one algorithm.
If you still don't get, why concatenating 5 algorithms is still only 1 algorithm, although a more complex one, then I can't help you further.
Is it really so hard to understand, that there's a difference between a machine that can compute *any* algorithm, including your franken-algo of 5 hashes after another and *just those 5 hashes*?
Just think of hashes like machines that produce yellow rubber duckies and CPUs/GPUs of robots that can do *anything*, including producing rubber duckies.
Now we start a race of who can build the most rubber duckies. You start with the robot and program it to build rubber duckies, which makes him pick up raw materials, drive over to some furnace or whatever, picks up molds, cools the hot rubber etc. etc. and after a while rubber duckies will start to appear.
Meanwhile I start building my rubber ducky machine. It's not ready yet, so no rubber duckies appear on my side.
You notice that your robot, being a universal robot, possess the functionality of flying, but it never actually uses it. So you remove the rotor blades and utilize the motors for driving and additional arms. It's not a universal robot now (CPU), now it's more optimized for producing yellow rubber duckies (GPU) and produces even more of them. You could program it to produce roller blades too, and it would produce them as efficient as it produces yellow rubber duckies, but you don't. Your stash of yellow rubber duckies grows and grows.
Meanwhile, I'm still building my yellow rubber ducky machine. Still no rubber duckies on my side.
Then one day, my machine is done and over night it produces 100 times more yellow rubber duckies than you produced with your general robot and later optimized robot the whole time it has been running. I'm running now a yellow rubber ducky ASIC.
Now you have the genius idea to change the thing that has to be produced into a yellow rubber ducky (algo 1), that has to sit in a little plastic boat (algo 2), that swims in a little wooden pool (algo 3), that spins on a little metal carousel (algo 4) that's in a little glass bubble (algo 5).
You program your optimized robot (luckily flight is not needed for any of the tasks) and start producing duckies in boats in pools on carousels in glass bubbles, while I'm back at square one.
But guess what... I'm starting to build a machine, that produces duckies in boats in pools on carousels in glass bubbles and once I'm done, I'm going to outperform you *again*, and *again* and *again*.
Everything that can be produced by your robot, can be produced by a specialized machine more efficiently.
In mathematics it's the same. If you can write a program to do X, then I can build a machine, or an integrated circuit, or train a monkey to do X too. And it doesn't matter if X can be separated into 5 sub-algorithms. A hashing algorithm is a sequence of atomic functions anyway, why would you think that increasing the depth of functions changes anything?

I think the difference was always, that WU could and did charge the markup because of a quasi-monopoly they had and have on remittances, gained often by favorable legislation, for example license requirements not fulfilled easily by competition.
That's different with Bitcoin startups: everybody is free to enter and innovative the market. That nobody is coming along and making a "Mega Bitcoin-Bon" only charging 7% markup and after that the "Ultra Bitcoin-Bon" with 6 and so on is due to market forces, not licensing or crap like that.
Also, for many relying on remittances WU is the only option. But with buying bitcoin, there are literally hundreds of options to buy. The markup is simply a convenience fee for anonymity and availability. Something that online exchanges or in person trades might not be able to provide.

What is MIA?
Currently, the 5btc are at an address of your wallet.dat file (bitcoin-qt).
The only thing that's keeping you from seeing that balance, is bitcoin-qt being out of sync.
Instead of waiting for it to sync, you can just import the private keys from your wallet.dat into any client that doesn't need syncing.
Blockchain.info and Electrum are such clients. The import at Blockchain.info is probably a little easier, because Electrum needs you to copy and paste the private keys as plain text. This requires you to export them which is one additional step for you.
Whatever you do, I recommend to send the funds to Electrum and archive the wallet.dat. That syncing is a drain on the network and a hassle for you.

You could also seize the opportunity and print out a few more paper wallets for you personal use.

They are not lost. Just copy and paste the address you sent your bitcoins to into blockchain.info search field and you'll see your balance there. The bitcoin-qt client just doesn't know about it yet, because it's out of sync.
If I were you, I'd export the wallet.dat to a text-file and import the keys into a brand new [Electrum]( installation. Electrum has the advantage, that you don't have to synchronize the wallet and that you have an eternal backup by writing down the 12 word seed. Then just send your bitcoins to an address generated by Electrum (not an imported one).
Alternatively, you can also import the wallet.dat-file into the blockchain.info wallet and then send the bitcoins to an Electrum address, if the exporting-importing is too complicated.
You can export the wallet.dat into a text-file by doing the following:
* In bitcoin-qt, open the console: In the menu-bar, choose "Help" and then "debug window"
* In that windows choose "console" and type `walletpassphrase 'your_passphrase' 600` This unlocks the wallet for 600 seconds
* Then type the command `dumpwallet PATH_WHERE_YOU_WANT_IT/wallet.txt`
Depending on the system you are on, the path where the text-file containing your addresses and private keys should be put varies. On a Linux system, you'd use /home/your_user_name/wallet.txt, on Windows maybe something like C:\

Notice how spam is suddenly an issue again, the larger the blocksize gets. At infinite/dynamic block size, suddenly transaction cost is once again burdened on the network-maintainers, like with e-mails and other near-zero-transaction-cost protocols.

I agree, but want to point out one thing: Perfect is the enemy of good.
Even without SegWit, bitcoin is still the best money. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a "genuine bitcoin standard"-model of money and currency, meaning that various institutions hold bitcoin in reserves and issue currency that is backed by bitcoin, like it used to work with gold for hundreds of years. These currencies probably will be handled by conventional databases.
It's absolutely possible to do that in a trustless way, using multisig wallets, so whoever issues you currency for your bitcoins, can't run with your money.
The "banks" would have to do on-chain transactions only very infrequently and only the differences between whatever settling period they agreed upon.
They will have to react to market pressure to prove their reserves periodically, like every 10 minutes, by signing the latest bitcoin-block-hash with their private keys and so on.
I'm not even sure, if even with segwit enabled, that this model won't catch on. It worked pretty good for a very long time, and now that reserves can be, and will have to be, cryptographically proven, fractional reserve banking is damn near impossible. Also, such a currency issuing institution can be completely pseudonymous within a network like TOR. FRB and highjacking by governments were the Achilles heels of gold backed banking, and both disappear with bitcoin.

I don't think that it's possible to verify that another party still has access to his share, without trusting his word that he actually does.
If you want something like that, it would probably be better, to use a m-of-n multisig. You could have the parties sign the block-hash of every *N*th block using their private key, or every 3rd PowerBall result, or every 4th NYT headline, etc.

I completely agree and also don't *really* understand what all the fuzz is about. If someone wants to fork and mine rules he thinks are better, let him. I don't care. If he thinks he can pull it off, more power to him.
Like, what if I start mining, even with considerable amount of power, and said: From block *X* on forward, I'm going to fork to this new rules, which include that every block must have a low-res picture of PewDiePie embedded in it. Everybody would just be like: "okay, see ya" and move on. But somehow "OMGZ!!1 there's a bitcoin exchange on board and it's a blocksize increase which isn't as dumb as embedded PewDiePie pictures, what noa?!"

To me, bitcoins characteristics make it the hardest money ever created by mankind and from all I know about economics, thus it's only a matter of time until it will be the world reserve currency.
Murad makes some great points in this interview about it: 
If bitcoin is the next global money (after gold, not even the dollar is a truly global money), then that's a multi deca-trillion USD asset. Or, even if it's only for store of value, it's also a few tens of trillion USD market cap.
The road from zero to 10 million per bitcoin, which again, isn't extremely outlandish within the next 10 to 20 years, is going to have extreme volatility.
In fact, if it weren't as volatile, it would feel manufactured, unreal, like a scam.
These extreme ups and downs are completely normal and expected, if not welcomed, for something that is establishing itself as a truly a-political, sovereign world reserve asset.

IP is actually a pretty mediocre routing protocol. No anonymity, in its current form only ~2^32 public addresses, no mechanism to gradually upgrade the protocol (which is why IPv6 deployment is slow) and a few other shortcomings other, even older, routing protocols didn't have.
The Internet is great, don't get me wrong. But it's only great because it was the first of it's kind and the network effect makes it now somewhat impossible to replace or upgrade.
With Bitcoin it's actually kind of the same. I'm not an altcoin shill. I never had altcoins and I don't think I will ever buy one, but bitcoin is also not *that* good of a crypto-currency, only the first one and the network effect now makes it, just like the Internet, pretty much impossible to replace.

The price could go up after you sold. SegWit activation, which is IMO a given at this point, could boost the price significantly.
Also what is to be considered, that if a chain-fork happens and you hold your bitcoins before it, you own them in both chains. You could hodl through and then in a year or so sell coins of the chain that's worthless, or worthless to you. You might end up with more networth than pre-fork, if the combined value is greater than a single chain is, like it happened with Etherium and Etherium classic.
I'm hodling. This whole thing is probably going to be just yet another minor bump in the road, that looks so significant right now, but doesn't matter in the long run, like MTGOX, the first mining pool approaching 51%, SilkRoad being busted, Satoshi being uncovered, twice, etc. etc. etc.

From the StrongCoin-website:




You write:




Which means, if you used a sufficiently strong password, given that AES has no backdoors, the private key is as good as lost. Which is a good thing for everybody who relies on AES and remembers his password, because that makes it actually secure, but bad for you.
Maybe Dave from Dave's Wallet Recovery Service[1] has some experience with how StrongCoin encrypts the keys and if you remember at least part of the password, he may be able to crack it, but 0.004 bitcoins isn't worth it, *yet*. I would gather and secure as much information about how exactly StrongCoin encrypts the keys (like, is it base64 of the encrypted key in hex-form and then again base64 of that? Or is it encrypted key in binary, base64 of that, encrypted again, turned to base64,...) and try the service when 20% of 0.004 btc is a few thousand dollars worth. (20% is his cut I think). In case StrongCoin isn't around then, you should find out how their mechanism of encryption is done in the near future.

It's like with other things.. you have to go slow first. Move more and more of your net worth into bitcoin. Do that over a timeframe of 2 years and you'll most likely be well into double or digit-figure gains, percentage wise.

If that *someone* has the strong feeling that this scenario is going to become reality in the near future, I would act fast. Usually you have to verify your identity with exchanges which can take some time. Things like scans of your passport and a utility bill might be required. Then there's the painfully slow legacy banking system on top of that and so on.
If that someone is planning on leaving the banking system, he or she shouldn't put all his or her eggs in one basket, though.
I would diversify into
* Bitcoin
* Gold
* Silver
* Cash Euros
* Cash USD
Percentage is difficult. I would assess how much Euros that someone is going to need on demand and leave that untouched. You know, for emergencies. How you diversify the rest is more or less up to you .. I mean that someone... and how much risk he or she is willing to take. I for one have about 50% of my net-worth in Bitcoin, 25 in gold, 25 in Euros. The euros are in a bank, for now (but I'm not from Greece). Only a little silver, not worth mentioning and no USD.
I don't want to sound like that paranoid prepper dude who lives off grid, but if that someone really thinks that the shit is about to hit the fan big time in Greece, he or she should also think about acquiring a substantial food supply, drinking water, a plan to get the fuck out, and guns and ammo. Think about long waiting lines at super markets, pharmacies, gas stations, etc. Seriously, get a decent rifle (I recommend either an AR-15 or AK-47), a concealable handgun (I recommend a Glock 19) and lots of ammo. I view guns and ammo as a sort of life insurance. Good to have if you need it, but hopefully never needed.

You don't miss anything. That's exactly how it works. I was thinking about using a Pi too. Right now I'm booting from a USB3 thumb drive, on which I installed LinuxMint encrypted. That works pretty neat too. The advantage of the Pi is of course, that there aren't any binary blobs, not even in the BIOS. If I ever switch to the Pi, I would encrypt the whole root partition too, preferably with the Electrum seed itself, so every time you boot it up, you have to type it in, which makes you memorize it and also the encryption of the system is as strong as the bitcoin private keys themselves, so if it ever gets lost or stolen, cracking the encryption is as futile as brute-forcing private keys, which the attacker could have tried without physical possession of your Pi anyway.

Again, eBay is hosted on their servers and they can decide in which way they are to be used. Just like a restaurant owner can ban meat from being sold in his restaurant. Here the owner of the restaurant decides how the kitchen is to be used. However, the restaurant owner can not tell you, once you bought the food from him, HOW to eat it. Maybe you want to wait until it's cold, maybe you want to put a pound of salt on it, maybe you are going to snort it through your nose. Once it's your property, you can decide what do with it. He can, of course, kick you out of the restaurant, if you, say, snort your noodles through your nose, but he cannot control what you do with your property.
With Apple, this would work like with the Google Play store: Google can decide which apps are available on their platform, after all it's their platform. But they can't control what apps you install manually, including, an app store from another company, since that would be not controlling their Play Store, but your phone.

For security reasons, you can't change the bitcoin address you provided, so make it count. I'd use a native SegWit address (`bc1...`) to optimize on transaction fees later on, and probably using a cold-storage wallet for that is a good idea too, even if you send it to Wasabi and your ultimate cold storage later on.

I see your point, that what Apple and Ebay are doing, at first, seems to be the same. Both are exercising their property rights to their servers, by deciding what is hosted on them and what is not.
There is one fundamental difference though, which I'm trying to get across here:
When Apple controls the App-Store-Servers, they are also controlling your iPhone, by making it technically impossible to install apps any other way than through their App-Store-Servers. (assuming you own an iPhone; I'm excluding jailbreaking)
Ebay does not do that. Ebay only controls your property as much as Walmart does. They don't. You can't buy *everything* at Ebay or Walmart (like Elephants or Bitcoins), but whatever you can buy, once you bought it, it's yours and they are not trying to limit the way in which you use it.
By controlling the only gateway to apps to an iPhone, Apple controls how their customers utilize their iPhones. Ebay isn't even in a position for me to come up with an analogy.
I'm not saying, that Apple is evil for doing so. They don't force anybody to buy their products and they make this practice clear in the contract you signed, when you bought an iPhone.
But I am saying, that people have to stay true to their contracts. If you agree that Apple controls what Apps can be installed on your iPhone, and one day you don't like it anymore, too bad. You signed a contract. If you try to weezle your way out of it, like jailbreaking, petitioning or whatever, what you are essentially are saying, is that your contractual consent doesn't mean anything. Again, this is okay for a child, but not for a free man. The only way to get out of that contract like a man, is to refuse to use the iPhone all together and to refuse to make any more contracts with companies, that won't give you full control over your property.

2) People react to incentives, i.e. money thrown in their direction, or NOT thrown in their direction
3) Buying a product and then asking like a slave if you might do as you please with it, is worthless. You already gave them an incentive, your money. And what did you provide an incentive for? Creating something that looks cool, is handy... and locks you up.
This is textbook immaturity. No amount of verbal diarrhea I may use in a post, is as immature as a grown up person, asking someone if it's okay, only if it's not too much of a hassle, of course, to please, PLEASE, let me use my property as I sees fit.
This is the behaviour of a child. So don't ask me, if I'm 14 years old. Ask the initiator and all supporters of this petition, if they are grown up people, able to decide for themself about the application of their property.
I'm 27 btw.

You have to be at least 12 years old to post on this board.

Good idea. I always wanted to sync my porn collection into the blockchain. It's my Ver given right to so without having to pay more than $0.05 for it to be stored forever, immutable by thousands of people around the world. I'm sure everybody running a fullnode will understand.

To my knowledge, this self-addressed letter approach is actually legal and holds up in court in my country (Austria). Thus I think time stamping data using the blockchain has a good chance of holding up too. Of course this can't be said about every legal system on the planet.

Your analogy with Paypal and Amazon is flawed. Paypal does not interfere with your property rights. Paypal maintains servers, which are their property and decides to use them in a way, that does not involve bitcoin. This is perfectly fine. You can't force anybody to use anything. Apple on the other hand, restricts not their, but your property (in case you own an iPhone).
Asking Paypal to adopt bitcoin is asking them to change their usage of their property. That is totally fine. Asking Apple to not restrict me in my decision what to put on my iPhone, is asking Apple to let me use MY property. That would be childish of me and a crime by Apple. The fact, that it's legal, tells you something about this bought and sold legal justice system we (US and EU) live in.
As to the emotional part: It's fun to rant sometimes. It's the Internet, ffs, where else can you write so freely?

You hold the bitcoins in your Trezor and when you want to sell them, you send them to a bitcoin-deposit address of your Coinbase account.

The censoring of bitcoin related apps by Apple Inc. may be the first time for many Apple customers to realize, that they bought into a closed platform. This means, that the very technology, cryptography in this case, that empowers the users through software like bitcoin, is used by Apple to control and subjugate the users.
This is a big pill to swallow for many people. You trusted this company to provide you with a product that fits you needs. So far, this was the case, but now you've felt the shackles on your legs. The chain was long enough for you to give you the feeling of moving freely, but you've reached the end of it.
You bought into a defective platform, because you didn't inform yourself, or because you thought it won't be as bad as it seems.
A grown up, mature person, owns his actions and their consequences, like he owns his property. You bought from a company, who intentionally sold you a defective product. A product built to be controlled by them, even after you bought it. The only thing a grown up, mature person does with a defective product, is to throw it away and never buy from this company again, until they provide a functional product.
Asking a third party for permission to use your own property, as you see fit, is the behavior of a child. Only a child asks its parents, if it can play with its toys, if its okay to play in the bathtub with it and so on.
A mature, free person, just uses his property and discards of it, if it doesn't serve him, but others.
Don't be a child asking for permission. Be a free man or woman, own your actions, their consequences and your property and invest in an open platform. After all, openness is what you liked about bitcoin in the first place, or wasn't it?

Would you care to elaborate on how I'm shackled by Samsung via a Galaxy S3 i9300? Just to clarify, maybe that was a misunderstanding: I don't ask for Apple to deliver an open source operating system, from cpu-embedded microcode to apps. I'm speaking of an open platform, which means that there is not one exclusive, third party controlled way for installing and running software. MS Windows and even Mac OS X, for example, are open platforms.

You mean something like this?
