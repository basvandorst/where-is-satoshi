Anyone who put in more than they could afford to lose were idiots and are now fucked, no doubt.
But if you put in a little you don't mind losing, and it's now at negative initial balance. I say keep it in and hope for another bullrush. Where's the harm? You never know.
While I don't see another run like this being realistic, I wouldn't be suprised if after the crash we see prices climbing past 40 again, which is why I'll probably buy in if it crashes low enough.
But yeah, make no mistake, you should all have seen this bubble coming two miles away and boy is it an epic bubble.
And anyone who says this is a dip is suicidal. It might get a slight upturn again but we're in the crash, panic can not be stopped.

Meet on IRC at the designated time and be prepared for a late night.
So they have a designated time, but they require a pastebin post to tell people to get on irc at the time already designated?
This reads like really shitty spy fiction, which is frankly what it is. Fiction.

I work on commission, I make no complaints about my salary. That and I was just offered a new sales job in the business to business IT sector.
My finances are quite sound I assure you.

Perhaps you should let your wife handle the finances from now on.
That isn't an insult by the way, that's sound advice based on what I've seen from you so far. She seems the more sensible of the two of you.

Not even remotely crashy enough for me. I'm not touching it until under 30 and unless it stabilizes around there I'm waiting for 10.

Motherfucking Dan Brown ladies and gentlemen.

I have nothing invested in Bitcoin (I've been waiting for the crash, I might buy in later if it goes low enough). However, for those of you with a large loss at the moment, I'd like to quote you something my dad once quoted me.
It was the 80s and there was a massive crash on the stock market, a reporter was interviewing a shipping magnate and he asked cockily "So how many millions have you lost on this?" to which the shipping magnate replied "Not a damn thing, I haven't sold out yet."
So yeah, the value is low, and it's dubious it'll ever get this high again but if you've just lost 50% of your investment, and you can afford it, you might as well just leave the money in and see if it gets back up a year or two from now.
Prices go up, prices go down, prices go up, prices go down.

Guys, panic has set in, it *will* crash and anyone buying in with a billion right now is too dumb to have acquired a billion to begin with.
This is big money propaganda to keep the little money in until they've sold out or gotten you to buy their dump at the top.
It is crashing, panic trains are not stopped.
