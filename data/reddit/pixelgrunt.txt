Precisely why I qualified my original statement with ‘conservatively.’

At first, I thought this wasn’t going to be an issue since it would be so far into the future that the penny would be irrelevant by then, but this will happen when 1 BTC = $1,000,000. It may not be as far away as many think. Bitcoin may lose *some* utility as a currency when this happens, but it won’t lose *all* utility as a currency.

You don’t have to purchase a full bitcoin. If you only have $50, or $10, or whatever, you can exchange it for a fraction of a bitcoin. For example, $50 USD is about 0.0050319728 BTC right now. However, the fees charged by exchanges consume a significant portion of smaller purchases like this.

Only a little under 18M have been mined so far, and conservative estimates say that a million or more are gone forever due to lost private keys.

I'm not sure what the OC was, but I'm assuming it was something long the lines of 'one in a million.' Estimates put the number of lost bitcoin between [2 million and 4 million]) so it's significantly lower than 21.

21 million is the limit in the bitcoin code, but a non-trivial portion of that has been lost already. Low estimates are around 2 million lost, and the higher end says [much closer to 4 million.](

Yup, [the Gallardo]( is tame.
I understand you qualified it with "pretty tame," but these things are still dangerous with stupid drivers (as is any car).
