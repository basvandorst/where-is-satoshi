I got one, I feel good.  Now I just worry about losing the Trezor and back up card.

Thank you.  I didn't put the space before the -datadir=...
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:54:40
Thank you for the info.  It is telling me that it can't find the folder.  I am putting in: -datadir=E:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin
I tried putting it after the "Target" and "Start in" boxes.
Do you have any tips?
edit: wtf, I can't find my wallet.dat file...
@_date: 2016-04-18 03:52:01
I checked it out.  It looks good, and at a good price, but I'm in the US :(
@_date: 2016-04-18 00:45:08
Thank you, do you have any recommendations?

I would say it sounds pretty pessimistic now. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:40:47
That sucks.  I invested a good amount with them.  It seems pretty dumb to rip people off.  It seems like they could have made good money by just being honest and offering a good service.
@_date: 2014-09-03 05:19:09
You can never be too safe.  I'm just curious, how much bitcoin was in the wallet, and where do you store it now?
@_date: 2014-05-22 05:38:19


Screw that guy.  Tell me more about robbing him.

Also, $500 at a fancy Manhattan restaurant... so dinner for 2-4?

cool story bro
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:41:57
That is weird.  I normally tip strippers with doge coin.  much lap dance, such boner.

He seems to be much more open and honest than any politician I've seen before (besides Ron Paul).  Check out his 100 day plan.  He is actively checking off each thing day by day.

I was talking about his year.  That should be pretty obvious...  I heard a full interview on NPR where Weld said that was their goal .

And if I drop my paper backup into the toilet?

She said the Libertarian Party.  I think she is referring to Johnson and his VP.  They openly said their goal was to steal votes from Trump so that Hillary would win.
@_date: 2015-05-18 17:56:33
He is in the Bitcoin business because of that.  That is, the business of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:55:39
For real, I just keep my btc on Mt.Gox.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:02:35
What, no bitcoin gold, bitcoin light, bitcoin silver, bitcoin smackers, bitcoin bits, bitcoin bacon bits, or bitcoin lite? 
@_date: 2016-11-08 02:43:05
Did you make a big bet on Trump?  I got him at +450 :)
@_date: 2019-10-04 07:28:52
I'll stick with Mt.Gox, thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-04 18:38:28
Oh, you know...
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:27:09
They accept deposits in crypto,so that should be easy. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 23:58:18
I can't figure out this changetip bs.  PM me your deposit code and I will send you .01 btc for the help.

I love this quote.  I never thought about it that way, but that is very true.  It is not just about inflation, but also controlling how you use your own* money.
@_date: 2016-05-13 07:12:44
Thank you for the help .01 btc

[Here is the site](  I am looking to accept bitcoin as an alternative payment method.  I am fine with it going straight to my bitcoin wallet, but I don't have a clue how to start.
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:50:48
I hear that the majority of drug users and dealers use this currency.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:49:08
Thank you for the feedback.  We are currently working on that.  
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:09:48
Has anyone heard of [paysius](

Thank you for the motivation. :)

I am trying this button, but it doesn't work.  When I try to add the code, the data "code" and "href" parts disappear.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:31:54
Feedback on the content/wording is appreciated as well.  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:55:40
I meant a recommendation for a site that accepts bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:43:56
Ya, I still am out $2k.  Supposedly the US Justice department will pay me back.  I don't know how that makes any sense.
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:04:26
Thanks, will try.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:48:14
Sorry, not trying to spam.  I just saw the number one post about businesses accepting bitcoin and thought I would toss this up.  I won't post this again for a long time.

Really?  Over 10x growth per year is slow?
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:17:10
Ya, I was surprised it didn't say anything.  I thought it would have been posted by now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:51:35
What is that stuff they are throwing at each other?
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:03:59
I am still trying to work mine out.  The button features are not working on my site. Any luck with yours?
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:07:31
I am looking for him to pay me in bitcoin.  I think the best way is to tell him the benefits.
@_date: 2013-02-26 21:29:07
Thanks for the help.  I am trying option one, but can't find a good site for an automatic payment button.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:30:44
Wow, really that much dislike?
I see btc as more of an investment than a gamble.  
I just thought this was funny :(
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:09:23
I think this is the best idea ever.  I wanted to do this, good luck with it!  Let me know if you are looking for any help, I am into bitcoin, a poker player, and have run multiple businesses.
@_date: 2013-02-26 22:03:20
I am looking for the easiest way.  I would like some sort of "pay with bitcoin" button that sends bitcoin directly to my wallet, I don't know how to use code though.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:28:32
I get that, but it is not slow.
@_date: 2013-04-17 18:05:44
In that case...

Can we call some small unit of bitcoin a credit(perhaps .0001)?  I want to feel like I am in a sci-fi movie.
