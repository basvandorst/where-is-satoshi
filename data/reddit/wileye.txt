Sorry, we're out of ice soap for the foreseeable future... I have to get hopped up on 3am chili before I can make a batch, and right now I only have premixed seasoning packets.

Man, I wish we could. Right now our shipping rates are actually less than what we're paying at the post office.
Which country are you in? If you send me PM I'll see if we can find a way to get you an order.

Arko is good stuff. No shame. Thanks for checking us out!

Hold up, you mean to tell me that other people don't have comprehensive theft/collision insurance on their dog? I can't be the only one, right?

Are jalapenos the current 5GH/S miners on their site, or are those called something else?

It really just started as a hobby. As a kid I have these fond memories of going to craft fairs in the park and seeing people make batches of soap in big, gnarly looking wooden molds. So, one evening after remembering this I somehow ended up reading the wikipedia article on soap making and decided to order some supplies. Quite a few failed batches later here I am!

So the whole process is a little tricky right now... basically we're skipping the regular Shopify cart system and have a "pay with bitcoin" button through coinbase. We've gotten some great suggestions from people on though, and we're hoping to get a bitcoin-only storefront going which will make the checkout process much smoother.
