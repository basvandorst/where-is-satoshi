this one is a good advice in relation to bitcoin...

there is no contradiction.
That's just like Russia's economy.  There is lot of components in Russia's GDP besides oil and other natural resources.
Still, take away oil and resources out of Russia and all the rest GDP components would drastically shrink.
Everything derives its value from solving some problems of humans.  In case of bitcoin nature of these problems is inherently tax or law evading.

if you have hard time to follow: my stance is similar to yours (no legal bitcoin use case).
I mentioned micropayments as a concession to opposing party (because opposing party mentioned "changetip" and it is usually easier to convey one's point of view if you make little concessions:)
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:29:49
you should ask someone else for good examples on this matter.
Let me quote my main point from

re international remittance: there are countries which impose legal/paperwork impediments (or unfavorable conversion rates) on international transfers e.g. Russia or Argentina.
If you are resident in Russia then you cannot just go and send bank wire to your own account overseas.  It would be blocked by currency comptroller.
Using bitcoin allows to circumvent such hindrances.

(1) lendingclub gives you a lot of control about filtering criteria.  If you get bad results it likely suggests that your filtering criteria were not so good.  You should experiment with different filtering criteria and put corresponding loans to different portfolios to be able to compare them.
(2) 20 loans is too little: 1 single loan can set balance off by whopping 5%.

I agree that there is a number of legit applications of bitcoin: e.g. micropayments or international remittance.
Still my point is:
in all such cases there is either
(1) a way to do it more conveniently and more efficiently without bitcoin;
or (2) there are hidden legal and taxation factors which are just silently ignored by using bitcoin (e.g. using bitcoin for international remittance).

use cases of altcoins are mostly the same as bitcoin (or even larger e.g. ethereum).
If I want to pay anonymously for some indecent or illegal deed I can pay in any altcoin whichever is less volatile (and bitcoin is not necessarily the least volatile of them).

good that you noted that.
There is huge demand for dollars/euros because people and corporations have debts and liabilities nominated in dollars/euros and they need dollars/euros to fulfill them.
How many people and corporations have liabilities nominated in bitcoin??
Drug cartels, who else?

The problem is that infrastructure behind Bitcoin is quite expensive to support.    There is no real gain in terms of costs.
Decentralized solution is always more expensive to support than centralized one.

no, it's not.  Periodic table limits alternative metals and their properties.
There is no limiting periodic table for altcoins.

there is analogue of FDIC insurance for Ukranian (and Russian) banks.  And the thing is that this insurance works in local currency.
Even if it works in USD then they will be converted at long outdated unfavorable rate.

Nano S has display
@_date: 2017-05-05 22:08:22


Actually, "they" trick would be problematic in some other languages since, for instance, Polish language differentiates between "they all masculine " and "they all feminine".
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:47:16
it's ridiculously (4 times) more expensive than Nano S.
Just does not make sense to buy this, what's gain?

ATM?  can one sell bitcoins there for cash without disclosing id?
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:17:16


there is real demand for dollars.  People's mortgages are nominated in dollars, not bitcoin.  People's taxes (e.g. property tax) are nominated in dollars, not bitcoin.  Corporations' and people's debts are nominated in dollars, not bitcoin.

americans already have to report all foreign accounts (if total amount exceeds $10k) every year (FBAR form).
How this proposed legislation is any different from FBAR??
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:59:23
arguably cryptocurrencies are much alike foreign accounts: 
one's cryptocurrency wallet is basically an account in some international cross-border decentralized "credit union"
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:14:55
All cryptocurrencies are governed by *DISTRIBUTED* algorithms, distributed blockchains.
Crucial part of all those algorithms is reconciliation between different nodes.
Windows is not distributed algorithm.
This explains why Bitcoin users form a congregation while Windows users don't...
@_date: 2017-06-22 16:54:25
what makes you think you understand it yourself let alone able to explain it to others?
You can start trying to explain here for us to see if you emphasize on relevant or irrelevant aspects of bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:01:23


Cryptocurrencies are not some computer codes.
Cryptocurrencies are Congregations of people who obey Rules of those codes.
Codes do not run by themselves without people investing nodes and power to run them.
Since those congregations are international, cross-border and not obeying any regulation of US government this means obviously that they are foreign entities.

or git repository: it is basically just what they want: chain of hashes.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:39:21
I don't say that cryptocurrencies conform to the letter of requirement of FBAR reporting.  Of course, not, and nobody obliged to report cryptocurrencies on FBAR at this moment.
But they are very much the same as foreign accounts in spirit.  I don't see a reason why FBAR is not going to be generalized to cryptocurrencies as well.

the topic is about *PROPOSED* legislation.  They have ample leeway in what to implement there and will be guided mainly by ideas not existing laws (except of Constitution).


I'm baffled why are you saying this?  I doubt 0.001% of what's written on reddit is new or ground breaking.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:21:22
yet they (cryptocurrencies wallets) are exactly this: your shares in some virtual offshore Bitcoin Corporation, or Bitcoin Trust, or Bitcoin Credit Union.
FBAR prescribes reporting not only bank accounts but also brokerage accounts i.e. shares of companies.
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:58:14


nope, you are not smart enough to understand it.


this depends on why people need dollar or bitcoin.
People need dollars usually to pay contracts (e.g. apartment lease), or pay taxes, or pay mortgage/debt.
For those needs alt currency can not serve as substitute.
People's contracts, taxes and mortgages are nominated in dollars, not alt currency.
In case of bitcoin the reasons why people would want to buy them are usually quite different: people don't have mortgages nominated in bitcoin.  Rather they want to pay for some illegal activity, or park money into something they expect to appreciate in the future, or to transfer moneys across the borders.
For all those needs there is really no big difference between bitcoin and leading alt cryptocurrencies.
This is why bitcoin and alt cryptocurrencies compete for people's demand which means that they compete for market capitalization.
