Haven't they been doing that same thing for years already by sugarcoating or outright lying about everything to do with their economy and currency?

I agree. It feels like those we elect are losing touch with what should be basic. We've gotten to a point where the police can seize your assets just because you have them in your car, without any actual proof of wrong doing, not charge you with any crime, and then force you to attempt to prove the property is innocent before even thinking of returning it. We can hold people in jail for "contempt", which can mean damn near anything, near eternally. We're using incarceration not as a way to remove people from society for rehabilitation, hell not even for punishment, but as a way to coerce them into testifying against themselves. It feels very much to me like it is an us vs them mentality at this point.


If we're just going to assume everyone is guilty but can't prove it, while we still dole out punishment for it, what kind of society is that? It's not that I don't care if he's a pedophile, but I care very much that they aren't charging the man and don't seem to want to without forcing him to testify against himself. At what point are we all forced to incriminate ourselves?  At what point will it be moot and just be accused means guilty?

I would wager the surface of the moon doesn't lend itself well to conducting vibrations as it is layered with dust from impacts. The energy would dissipate very quickly.
