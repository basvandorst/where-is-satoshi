No, 3 months. F is jan, g is feb, h is March. With an asset like btc the price could change a lot so few people want to lock in too high/low. If it was something like grain where you would deliver in a certain month the you’d trade to lock in the price that month.

Yeah, but there’s also a difference in the time value of money. What are you willing to pay today for something you’ll receive tomorrow? When you could invest at the risk free rate for a month and purchase. That plus the cost of contract are break even. On the other side, someone who provides btc (Square, Coinbase) is protecting again fx risk wiping out profit in the other direction.

The cboe will list the January Contract as XBTF8, for jan 18. It’s a notation from when traders would write them on card, standardization kept from mistakes when clearing.

most other things arent only divisible to 0.00. Presentation is important and there is a difference between trunked and rounded. Seems small but with large volumes means real $$$.
@_date: 2017-08-31 01:59:04
true, but thats not the true spread, as you would see on the exchange. The difference is what coinbase is manufacturing as a spread. Look at the sell and it will be 20-40 in the opposite direction, meaning they can easily scalp 80ish on each trade. 
better to trade on gdax

I agree w the point on uncertainty, but I think it's a fallacy to believe that just because one fork was good doesn't mean all will be

Yes there is. There is the markets, i.e. Exchanges. We know at any point what the fair market value is. And no, you won't be taxed on code...just like you won't be taxed on ownership of a company. But, if you want to realize a gain in value by selling said asset for fiat, then you will owe tax.

I would stick to your original investment plan. You made a decision based on what you though was sound thinking. Even if it’s not the winning decision you stuck to your plan. It’s important to learn to think rationally about emotions. And canceling orders to get more upside is the same as irrationally selling when you didn’t want to out of fear.
I keep a log of every trade and every exit planned. Follow through w each one unless there is a systematic change in the market. This keeps my decisions rational. Hodl is only one strategy. 
Good luck.

theyre basically acting as a clearinghouse. There is still a 4 day period from when transfer USD to Coinbase (technically a buy order is two transaction, transfer the USD to CB and then purchase BTC with the transfered funds, net fees.) 
Coinbase is now going to give you the BTC as soon as you initiate the order, and then assume the risk and cost associated with the 4 days it takes to transfer the funds. 
I'm sure they have an actuary on staff who has calculated the % of bad debts and how to price the spread accordingly.

each block in the blockchain includes a series of transactions and a hashed version of the block before it. Technically, when you send BTC it sends the entire amount in your address and returns the remainder of what youre not sending. This means that with everything transaction you make, everyone can verify the balance, and therefore the validity of the transaction.
