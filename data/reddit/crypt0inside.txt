Why not just use seed phrase?

I still don't get it. How exactly dust helps attacker? Even if I am using new address every time, my addresses will have 1 UTXO each formed from incoming transaction. And sooner or later I will use multiple UTXO to create one transaction that can be tracked by attacker.

Got it. Thanks for your explanation.

I live in Russia. There is no danger to Bitcoin and free internet at all. Government even can’t ban Telegram :D. 
They tried it many times and spent a lot of money on banning Telegram. But Telegram in Russia still working, even without VPN.
As for internet blocking, they just want to get money to fund this project(20 billion rubles). Classic situation in Russia, when government want to get free money from nowhere.

Thanks. Is there any apps for iPhone?

It's not a segwit address. It's a legacy address.

I checked it multiple times. The funds went exactly where i sent them. I know that i need a private key to spend the funds from the address. My question is not about the private key. I dont get why electrum doesn't show me any funds where i import my seed phrase. Address where i sent my funds is derivated from this seed phrase. But electrum and other wallets show me 0 balance.

It worked. Thanks for your advice. It's weird why all bitcoin wallets didn't show the transaction i sent. It looks like wallets show only exact amount of addresses. Everything beyond is not showing until i generate the address via interface or console :/   
Thanks for your help again.
