Because you don't want your pizza to go cold

Best idea. **Let's just go for this one otherwise we will never agree on something!**
Current price:
1000 bits for 1.15$!

This is true. That is why I still have a few bitcoins on my warm storage for transactions :-). Ordering pizza later today!

Caught me there ;-) If it is really easy to pay with gox mobile as well as buying BTC that is very nice. But still my suggestion would make a great plus.

There are API's indeed, but I don't see non techies running scripts to call an API.

I like the table view:
SCARCE - YES
CONVENIENT - YES
SECURE - YES
CENTRAL BANKING - NO

Spending on Amazon will be discounted 5% =&gt; 2% (I think people are thrilled to use bitcoins, so any discount is good).
Buying bitcoins will have a 6% fee =&gt; 3% fee (so people don't get the feeling they are paying too much).
To emphasize the simplicity make a short youtube video with a real life example. 
I like the idea that amazon is involved (although they actually aren't), it will give the users who are NOT familiar with bitcoin the feeling of using something that is familiar and trustworthy.

Think mobile. It is not so easy to pay in bitcoin and rebuy new bitcoins on your smartphone. This should definately improve!
The exchanges like gox, bitstamp,... where most people get their coins don't offer mobile apps to pay with bitcoins. We need those two things integrated.

It is easier because it is automated. You don't have to remember how much BTC you spent to buy again later (when the price has moved) on a different exchange.

Very clever idea! I would also be interested to test the amazon.de version. 
I do think that the percentages should be reviewed. Also try to market the fact that is easy to get bitcoins this way. People are still afraid of the regular exchanges.

good luck guys!

one of the proposals is to add bitcoin to the Cypriot stock market

tested BIP0038 on blockchain before storing the 25BTC. Works like a charm. Just import the private key and you can enter your password.

That is true, but I believe when this is shown transparantly this will not be an obstacle.

We should create a wiki for this.

Don't panic, will go up soon
