Well you actually can buy them using a CC on btc-e.com via the liqpay.com intermediary. It works pretty well, but chances are your first attempt will be blocked and you have to go through anti-fraud procedures with your bank.

Has anyone tried  yet?

afaik none of them prioritize fees, you'd need to negotiate something out of band.. also it's wrong to think that BTCGuild are the only ones who could do this..

btcCNY seems to accept Liberty Reserve for depositing.. it could be that a lot of this volume is actually from non-chinese users as I don't know of any other exchange currently taking LR for BTC.

there are around 1000 addresses with &gt;1000BTC.. and around 100 with more than 10000 btc.

basically, for maximum security it's best to never re-use the same bitcoin addresss twice.. this is because before a bitcoin address is used as an input to a transaction, the public key is not published - just the address which is derived from the public key. Without the public key it's even more impossible to break the private key.. also using different addresses each time makes it harder to track where money is going.. basically bitcoin was never really supposed to re-use bitcoin addresses... unfortunately most people now use it that way when really they shouldn't.. 
one solution for bitcoin-qt and paper wallets is you can just do another transaction paying everything back to the key that's on the paper wallet (after spending 5btc and getting the change back) although really it would be better if you just made a new paper wallet for the change :p

It doesn't really work like that.. manipulating the fees doesn't help at all as the p2p network will only relay the first tx it sees. 
There are only two ways to do this attack.. one you have to be directly connected to the roulette wheel and to all the mining pools. You send different transactions at the same time to the roulette and the mining pools. The wheel sees one, the mining pools see the other. If there's too much delay the roulette wheel will relay it's transaction to the miners and it won't work.
The other way requires the collusion of the mining pools.. they need to ignore the first tx and include your second double spend instead.. the code doesn't normally allow this, but it could be modified and I believe some pools already have hacked in facilities to allow prioritizing certain transactions, or inserting new ones.

so let some people frontrun the selloff? that would be totally unethical, if that's what they've done.

haha man.. after linode and now this.. people need to learn that it's not ok to run bitcoin wallets on services where the ISP has total access.. especially when all that will happen is the ISP says 'sorry we allowed someone to steal all your money'.

eh. i certainly wouldn't do it.. I think there's a good chance you'd just get a stupid tenant who didn't know what they were doing and would default on the rent if the deal went against them.
