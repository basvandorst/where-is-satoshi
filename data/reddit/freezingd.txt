Most of the people here praise hardware walltes but don't have one themselves because they actually only have some pocket money in crypto.
When you set one up, you get a seed that you have to write down and keep it safe. If it ever stops working you can buy a new one and have a backup with that seed.

In case I lose my wallet seed (Electrum), but I still have my wallet with password &amp; 2FA working, what should I do?
Can I get a new seed or read it out somehow, or should I create a new wallet and abandon the old one?

Ok thx, that's what I thought too. I haven't read of any way to restore the seed

I just withdrawed some mBTC to my wallet from gdax.com. And I received the exact same amount as I have chosen. Why were there no transaction fees for this as there are usually for all bitcoin transfers?

Can someone explain why paper wallets are considered so secure?
When I print them, who guarantees that there's no hacker making a copy of them in the process &amp; printing them for himself?

Why DO NOT EVER use a software wallet?


The same goes for hardware wallets. You have to write down your seed anyway.
The only risks I see are hackers/malware - but there are ways to prevent that, e.g. creating the wallet on an offline computer and enabling 2-factor-authentication.

Yes you can do that, you just need to be extra careful that you're safe from hackers &amp; malware.
But for that you can take certain measurements like 2-factor-authentication.

Yes it's possible but of course there's no guarantee for profit. In general you will have to pay more fees for buying and selling many times a day compared to long-term investments (e.g. buy now and sell 1 month later).
