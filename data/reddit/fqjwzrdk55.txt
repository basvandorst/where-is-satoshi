After reading the Wired and Gizmodo articles (and nothing else), this seems like an obvious hoax. Wired's article includes zero independent sources, Gizmodo's includes a handful of quotes from people that are all just repeating claims Wright made to them.
Whenever there is an expose that really exposes the truth, there are always lots of independent sources and people that knew the truth all along that come out. The evidence builds quickly and it's obvious to everyone reading the expose that the reporters got it right. That isn't true of these articles and frankly both of them leave me with the impression that the reporters were duped and were not stringent enough in verifying sources (Gizmodo at least tried to verify some of them, Wired doesn't mention even trying).
In regards to the actual evidence, the most obvious problem is that Satoshi wouldn't have been so sloppy. No way he's making random outbursts at meetings with tax authorities admitting he's Satoshi, no way he's sending emails from Satoshi's email address with identifiable real world information. And Satoshi wanting to establish a Bitcoin bank? Lol. The fact that neither article points out the incredible contradiction with Satoshi's philosophy shows a lot about how thorough the reports were (not).
I expect in the next few days we'll have lots of articles by people fact checking various aspects and pointing out how they were not able to verify them, and people that understand Bitcoin and its history better than the reporters pointing out obvious problems with Wright being Satoshi that the reporters were not knowledgeable enough to know.
