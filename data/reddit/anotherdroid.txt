Ok, I really appreciate you taking the time to comment. I have just purchased a Ledger Nano X, watched a few videos from that Rex guy on YouTube to clear my head.
So just to be clear, do I still need to have Coinbase account to buy/sell yeah? (or somewhere other than Coinbase)? 
I'm just going to keep reading, I know this information is out there. I just like talking to people :)
Thank you again!

So... dumb question for a n00b who needs to get some hardware. I have BTC over at Coinbase. Does this remove the need for Coinbase? If there is a better how-to for me to read when dealing with these hardware wallet, please send!
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:03:08
Yeah, good heads up. I really know I need to get off Coinbase. Thank you, I'm working on it!
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:25:38
Never tell anyone you own bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:35:02
I am so on it, thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to respond. I just ordered a Ledger Nano X. I really gotta get my shit together...

Cool advertising.
@_date: 2019-02-22 19:42:18
This is a disservice to Bitcoin and it's followers. And he knows it.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:41:13
the more you guys insist on relating Bitcoin to Wolf of Wall Street, the more people will realize Bitcoin is nothing but a penny market, preying on fools with dollars.
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:37:29
everything becomes popular for a reason. every meme is a social engineering feat. you liken bitcoin to penny stocks, the general public will perceive it as so. people are dumb as fuck. if that realization makes me woke, then put me on WSHH.
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:22:14
this is heresay. the other theory going around the message boards is that he created the whole meme meme. then bitcoin. then the bitcoin meme.
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:36:17
just saying... you gotta wonder where such a meme originates from. as a fool with too much invested in bitcoin, i feel like such a meme only makes bitcoin look like a scam.
@_date: 2019-01-25 17:25:13
is that an E71?? I did a year in Thailand with one of those...
@_date: 2018-11-19 17:05:28
i'm with you all the way. just saying, we need to be careful how we represent. Wolf of Wall Street does not help.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:13:59
Argh, how?! (rhetorical)
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:16:20
Lol, I just went there and searched, I love the top results (

I guess I really don't want this in my news feed anyway.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:14:04
ok, reddit user ;)
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:25:50
This entire world is an enemy of the free people.
@_date: 2013-12-10 21:26:57
this sounds like a scam, but i can't tell.
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:58:39
vegetable rights and peace!
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:52:22
i see what you did there.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:12:14
all hail the implied 1-year Bitcoin price chart!
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:33:46
i still don't know when to buy into this. it seems we're at an all time high, is that correct? am i waiting on a crash to buy? 
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:55:33
so... do i sell? buy? shit.
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:09:40
$10, but you have to buy a minimum of 2.
