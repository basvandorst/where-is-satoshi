An IOU is a bad analogy, as it implies that the other party can default and you are left with nothing (“see? I’m broke. Can’t get anything out of me so good luck with that IOU I gave you “).
This cannot happen with Lightning, because what you have is not an IOU but a completely signed TX that you only need to broadcast to the network and then you *have* actual bitcoins - and the other party cannot stop you from doing so, so you are never at the mercy of that other party.

I went through the hassle of logging out my normal account and logging in with my Bitcoin throwaway just to express my appreciation for your well thought out and well written post.
Thank you!

You are absolutely correct. If a hacker gains control of your lightning node, he can of course use it to make a lightning payment to his own address, with all the funds that are currently available in the channel. Node security is indeed very important. Or he can trigger a close/settlement of the channel and then use the private keys to steal the remaining funds with a normal on-chain tx.
This is because a lightning node must have access to the private keys of the bitcoins that you committed to the channel and must be able to use them without your intervention to sign transactions. Otherwise it would be pointless as a lightning node (not able to automatically route payments for the network and not able to automatically receive payments on your behalf).

You take the 24 seed words that you wrote down and stored in a safe place and use them with your replacement device (can be from a different compatible manufacturer) or with a compatible software wallet to again get control of your coins.

Your explanation is short, but wrong.
The halving of the block reward (which governs the limit of 21 million coins) has nothing to do with the difficulty.
Difficulty adjusts up (and down!) as hash power is added to or removed from the network.
Independently of that, a reward halving happens automatically every 210,000 blocks.

Umm, hate to say it, but: check your math...

That is not correct. You pay *income tax* on the profit. How much that is depends on what other income you have.

There's no danger to your BTC, if you do it in the right order:
Assuming that you have the private key for the (pre-fork) address that holds both BTC and BCH:
First, use your trusted BTC wallet to transfer the BTC to a new address. The "old" address now no longer contains any BTC (on the BTC chain), only BCH (on the BCH chain).
Then use whichever BCH wallet you trust to also move the BCH to a different address. Even if you don't fully trust this BCH wallet, exposing the private key to it endangers only the BCH. Your BTC that also used to be controlled by the same private key are however not in danger, as those are already at a different address (see step 1).

From the article:

One thing you should know: You don't actually store bitcoins, but only the private keys (sort of the secret passwords) that give you *access* to your bitcoins.
Whenever you want to spend (or otherwise transfer) your bitcoins, you need to create a transaction that is electronically signed by the private key(s) of the bitcoin(s) that you want to spend. Since you essentially cannot do this signing by hand, you need the help of a computer to do it for you. For this, the computer needs to have access to the private key(s).
And that's the moment where things can get dicey: If you allow your normal PC to see your private keys (to electronically sign a transaction for you), then there is always a chance that your PC is infected with a malware that sits silently in the background and waits for just that moment: When a private bitcoin key is exposed. The malware then uses that key to transfer the bitcoins to a different address than you intended to (an address controlled by the attacker). At that point, your coins are gone.
A "physical hardware" as you call it (the usual name is "hardware wallet"), is nothing else than a dedicated little computer that has two uses:
1. It stores your private keys in a way that they cannot be extracted and are also recoverable (on a new device), in case the hardware wallet is lost or destroyed.
2. It uses these private keys to electronically sign your transactions, **without exposing the keys to the outside**. I.e. whenever a transaction must be signed, instead of the sending the keys from the hardware wallet to the PC (where they could be compromised), the PC sends the (still unsigned) transaction to the hardware wallet, which signs it and then sends it back to the PC (all via USB).
In a sense, a hardware wallet is nothing but a special purpose computer, that is used to securely sign bitcoin transactions, without exposing the secret keys, that cannot be attacked by malware.

Depends on where you live. I know this doesn't work in the US, but just in case this is read by someone in Germany:
In Germany, according to the *current* laws, if you buy bitcoins (or similar) and hold them for &gt;1 year, you can sell them tax free, legally.
Possibly other countries have similar regulations, but that's beyond my knowledge.

There are ways to split coins even without replay protection, only they are complicated and error prone, so not something that Average Joe should attempt on his own. But exchanges should be able to do it - if they make the effort.
