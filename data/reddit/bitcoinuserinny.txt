Do hardware wallets generate the transactions inside the device itself? Is the private key ever exposed to the computer?
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:50:12
Your wallet is strange. There is no difference between fees and bitcoin "for the miners".
@_date: 2017-04-16 22:27:07
Don't worry about price. It's tempting, but don't just go to preev.com every 10 minutes to see how many pennies you made. Just use bitcoin as you would regular money. Do you check the exchange rates for your local fiat currency every 10 minutes? Of course not! Just buy the bitcoin, spend it on stuff, accept it for purchases, and save it for the future. Use it as you would any other currency.

How do you tip someone with bitcoin if they've never heard of it?
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:22:13
I agree, but the fee situation is a bit misleading. Most wallets recommend a fee over 0.5 dollars, but a fee of 0.2 will actually get your transaction into a block relatively quickly.
@_date: 2017-04-29 18:07:55
Try Coinbase, their fees are pretty reasonable. Bit of a long setup, but once you finish, buying bitcoin and using it will be easy.
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:25:01
mBTC is the best for normally-priced things.
What's easier to say:
-The book cost 15 mBTC
-The book cost 0.015 BTC
-The book cost 1.5 million satoshis
-The book cost 15,000 bits
I think the answer's pretty obvious.
Of course, if you're buying something such as a computer, it may be more convenient to say "This computer costs 1.15 BTC" than "this computer costs 1,150 mBTC."

How do I know that one a forgery that displays a similar-looking program that gives me a fake address (with funds) that isn't actually stored by the open dime ?

Great! 
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:48:25
What if a fake open dime which spreads malware is given? And what if I don't have the time to verify the transaction?

I personally use paper wallets for long-term storage. bitaddress.org is a great website for that. Download the website, disconnect from the internet, generate your wallet, and print. Then send the bitcoin to the address on the paper. As for buying, you will encounter fees just about anywhere.
@_date: 2017-04-17 20:10:53
bitaddress.org is another great paper wallet site
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:46:49
Nice, but printing an extra wallet may be important. 10 years from now, when that 50 mbtc is $50,000, you'll ask your friend about it and he'll say "Oh, that paper you gave my daughter when she was born ? Yeah, I think I threw that away when I was cleaning out the closet." Nonetheless, it's a very nice gesture, and I hope your friend keeps it safe.
@_date: 2017-04-29 13:33:43
I personally hold both gold and BTC. However, I'm more inclined to  buy bitcoin, because one can never be sure if the gold they buy is gold-plated tungsten. You can't forge bitcoins.

Well, how does one spend bitcoin using a hardware wallet? Does it not involve a computer?
@_date: 2017-04-25 01:15:30
Don't. Use. Online. Wallets. That. Store. Your. Keys.
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:25:59


How so? blockchain.info in particular is extremely secure. In fact, they don't even have full access to your private keys, it's all done in-browser. blockchain.info also has the seed words in case the website is shut down. And with mobile wallets, bitcoin can be carried whenever you carry your phone (aka most of the time). I guess the same thing could be done with hardware wallets, but they have to be plugged in to a computer to work, and it's an extra thing to carry around.

What if it's just a quick transaction intended to last a minute? And what if it's a fake but instead of a fake address it gives me malware? Giving USBs as a way to transfer bitcoin is just way too risky and trust-requiring for me.

How does Segwit make litecoin or bitcoin more anonymous?
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:16:37

@_date: 2017-04-29 18:01:02

In retrospect, I should've included a no bitcoin option. 
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:13:13
Yes, you will probably be given an address and told to send a specific amount to that address to pay the other wallet. You can send them that amount using the bitcoin you buy on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:38:22
So is this guy just bullshitting?
@_date: 2017-04-30 01:48:18
True. I'm also realizing in retrospect that I sounded a bit gloaty as well.
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:00:00
Ok, thanks. 
@_date: 2017-04-30 17:59:40
So it would cost more to spend an input from the first transaction than the second transaction?
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:17:19
Shit, you're right.
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:38:40
So this guy's bullshitting?
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:31:27
Exactly, I really don't see the advantages of hardware that could be wiped magnetically or break when a paper wallet properly stored and generated is much more safe for long-term storage. And for spending coins, just put that into an app such as bread wallet or blockchain.info. You've spent $0 for the same security and practicality that a Trezor will cost you &gt;$100.
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:04:39

I use bitcoin very sparingly. A donation here or there, buying gold using reliable websites, etc. Don't be afraid to spend, just don't spend too much.
@_date: 2017-04-21 11:46:12


From the White Paper (on modern financial institutional costs):


Bitcoin was meant to solve that, not use it as "digital gold" or whatever else you think it was made for.
Another thing about consumer use:


The use of the terms sellers and buyers makes it pretty clear that Bitcoin was meant to be used as a consumer payment network. Any other application is just a by-product of that use. 
You can read the White Paper here:
It's pretty clear, even from the name of the paper (Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System) that Bitcoin was meant for transactions, and to deny that bitcoin wasn't meant for consumer payments and that anybody who thinks otherwise is delusional is just straight up wrong.
EDIT: More proof from the White Paper:


Note the term "payment", which is another indicator that consumer use was intended.
@_date: 2017-04-27 11:28:01
What about the coinbase?
@_date: 2017-04-22 00:07:07
I think that Lightning and other off-chain transactions are very important and useful, but that the blockchain should still be available to those who want it. I think that blocks that gradually increase in size over time (remember, our storage capacity and RAM is only going to increase) combined with segwit would be the ideal situation to lower fees and congestion.

What exactly do you mean by that? That all alt coins are traded with Bitcoin as an in-between? Because that's not strictly the case. There is now a bigger market for alt-to-alt trades, and Bitcoin is slowly losing ground to other alt coins. We need to do something, and fast.

I wouldn't buy such a small amount if I were you. The fees to spend that $1 would be more than that $1. It's very unfortunate that fees are that high, and there are some very bright people looking into various solutions so that fees will be lower in the future.

Ok kid, but here's the thing: not everybody is a genius like you who clearly sees the obvious correct path. Now, this may be hard to follow, but not everybody has the same viewpoint as you. Crazy, right?




Um. Segwit2x has 80% has power. You literally can't do anything to stop 2MB blocks from happening. It's inevitable.

@_date: 2017-06-18 18:26:20
Why would storing it separately lessen the size of the transaction? The data's still there, right?
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:40:47
From Google: Able to be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking. Basically, bendable.
When I say this, I mean that bitcoin can be present in several locations, owned by several people, none, or potentially owned by someone. Bitcoin is much more bendable to me than cash, gold, or digital fiat.

So, from my understanding:
Right now, UTXO data and signature data are stored on the blockchain.
After segwit,
Signature data will be pruned and UTXO data will be left on chain.
Is this correct?

How do I "go back" to a subreddit I never went to? And why are you calling me "snowflake"? Because you can't refute my points?

These people think that you can just go to your bitcoin wallet, type "I want 1000000000 bitcoins" and it'll show up. They also think that whole bitcoins are the only unit of account. They're stupid people.

Good idea, I'll print a new version. I haven't loaded any funds yet.

But "American" and "Asian" aren't races whereas "white" and "Chinese" are.
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:55:37
The Chinese people are a race you imbecile.
@_date: 2017-06-19 17:00:05
And will regular Segwit signaling contribute to this 80%?
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:24:18
You should check out Coinbase, despite their recent outages, they're a great exchange and I've been using them for years.
As for storage, use bitaddress.org to make a BIP38 encrypted (basically password protected) paper wallet, print out a few copies, and distribute them. Keep one copy in your house, one copy with your mother's house, one copy in your bank deposit box, and so on. Be sure to use plastic baggies to store them. Good luck!
As for the price falling, it will definitely fall for each individual chain, but I believe that if you own Bitcoin right now, you could definitely profit a lot.

You're either messing with me or don't have access to Reddit, because I just posted 2 links to wikipedia in this exact thread.

I agree. Both sides are going to get what they wanted. Segwit supporters get Segwit, big blockers get big blocks.

Cool article about Germany. But I don't quite see anything about China there.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:40:43
I'm fully aware of that. I'm just saying that they're undetectable, and this this new law is extremely dumb.

When you store your bitcoin using the hash of a password as a private key. Because you know the password, you could always retrieve your bitcoins. And because it's only in your brain, provided you have a good password, nobody can get them.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:36:25
No, I'm saying that maybe the person sending money to you included the fee in the price.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:49:28
True, that would also essentially be a brain wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-20 01:23:05
I'm asking if it would be possible. It might be a fun thing to do, and it would be guaranteed to be very secure.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:00:11
Will I be able to use my paper wallet to make a Segwit transaction directly from my paper wallet, or would I have to move my coins from the paper wallet to a Segwit wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:19:08
Selling into fiat? Why would he?
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:17:13
... that is entwined with modern Chinese history of nation-building and race.
Think of it like Europe. There are Spaniards and Germans and Slavs and Anglos but they're all white. Same thing applies with China. The Chinese are a race.

I agree. If the NYA miners keep their promise, we're fine.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:35:46
Not if you have a really good password.
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:04:49


But it's literally not. You said so yourself. Let's say I'm a white person. If I make a bitcoin fork, is it fair for the Chinese to call it "Whiteycoin"? Of course not, that's racist. Same situation.
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:43:43
Fungible mean that two units of something are the exact same. This is not true for bitcoin, as two coins may arrive from different transaction chains. Pure gold is more fungible, as is digital fiat.
@_date: 2017-06-16 02:11:23
What do you mean by "what was done"? Sorry, I'm out of the loop.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:40:05
Well said. It was just like this in '13 when the price when from 1.2k to 300. And now look where it is. Some people need to learn to hold long term.
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:10:07


Yeah, but those nodes don't matter if they don't have as much hash power as the hard fork coin.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:10:30
What do you mean by split? Is it not added onto the blockchain?

I specifically pointed out that gold is hard to steal and transport internationally because of it's bulk, so I'm not sure if you read the whole thing.


True, if you store the majority of your bitcoin on an online computer. Which most bitcoin experts don't recommend. It's the equivalent of leaving a ton of gold in the woods and expecting nobody to take it.

Since the late 1980s, the most fundamental change of the People's Republic of China's nationalities and minorities policies is the renaming from "the Chinese People" (Chinese: 中国人民 or Zhongguo renmin) to "the Chinese Ethnicities" (Zhonghua minzu),

I didn't say that they aren't worth the same, I said that they're not the exact same thing. They have different chains of ownership on the blockchain, whereas two gold atoms are essentially indistinguishable from each other.
