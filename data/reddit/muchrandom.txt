I tested it today and it works great. Even the average Joe can use it, it's as easy as charging a pre-paid SIM at the ATM.

you don't have to provide any identification. I just bought a small amount at a ZebraPay ATM to test and it went smooth.

this is excellent news. These ATMs are virtually everywhere. Even with 4% commission, it's still a much better alternative to the shitty Paysafecard which is quite popular here in Romania.

1 million what?   
I'm sure the guys in Zimbabwe would love to buy some cheap coins.

They can start a car wash business that accepts bitcoin

Excellent news! I was skeptical about their return and was planning to move my coins in the very next minute they come back, if they ever come back. But frankly, I feel safer now and confident in keeping them with Bitstamp. Am I a fool?

I do trade from time to time. Anyway, the reason I had the coins there in the first place was because I was planning to withdrawal into fiat, then I was busy a few days, some more days BTC kept crashing and I said "meh, I'll wait some more... ".   
Some of the coins I moved to Bitstamp were from blockchain.info after I've read here that they are insecure. So I felt like Bad Luck Brian of BTC:   
- Move coins from insecure service to avoid getting hacked
- BTC service you moved coins to gets hacked   
I was like FFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUU.

e-coin.io is very good.
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:37:36
Yes, got it
@_date: 2016-06-13 09:18:23
no idea.

[Bitcoin Checker]( For sound alerts you can choose between Notification Stream or Alarm Stream. I guess that the Alarm Stream should do it.

That's great. Maybe at some point they'll integrate a search function, too. Because, you know, some people need to search through inbox.

ramnode is very good. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:47:16
Yes

probably some mass selling before the halving because nobody knows what happens next.
