And that is the perfect attitude to have. Life is about trial and error. If a new system doesn't work, then it doesn't work. But now we would be equipped with the knowledge to retest with a new variable to account for.
Or would we rather have Bitcoin run like a government; if part of the system fails, we artifically prop it up and patch it - until we are all riding in a boat with a million patched, leaky holes.

I will use your analogy to further illustrate my point.


It's more like super-gluing a building together with bricks that have a slight flaw in them. Yeah, YOU SHOULDN'T super-glue bricks together to make a building. But whether that was a good choice or poor choice, the bricks should NOT have that slight flaw either. 
Using the improper tool for the job (mtgox using txn i.d.'s) - It doesn't excuse the bricks from being flawed (Bitcoin having malleable txn i.d.'s).
They both need fixed.

I'm a bit concerned with this subreddits reaction to this entire mtgox ordeal.
The hate-train for mtgox is going strong right now. In part, deservedly so. Peoples bitcoins and money are in limbo because this website failed to live up to a quality of service necessary when handling other peoples assets.
But at the end of the day Bitcoin does have a major flaw.


How can anyone say this isn't a large concern? We are all familiar with Mtgoxs role in Bitcoin trading. The literal backbone of Bitcoin exchanges for years has been ham-stringed because apparently Bitcoin transaction id's are changeable?
The point I'm trying to make is.... I'm getting the disappointing vibe from the community that Bitcoin is blindly infallible. No one will admit that Bitcoin shares part of the responsibility in this blunder.
When the worlds largest market for Bitcoin literally falls to its knees partly by incompetence, and partly by Bitcoin protocol flaw, then IT IS A LARGE CONCERN, then it IS in the "top ten list of dangers", whether you like it or not.

Bitcoin is not infallible. "Malleable transaction ids" needs a solution.

Which ones? All of them? At once? Impossible. 


Yes you could. You could spend them wherever anyone is willing to take them.


They can still convert Bitcoins to any currency they want. There will be people making money off of currency exchange and profit from this will be higher than ever due to the illegal nature.


I'm not an expert in study of this area but there are many governments that exist right now that have made possession and use of foreign currency illegal. In these countries, there are black markets for illegal currencies in which they are bought and sold. And I can only assume since theses transactions are illegal,  people are paying a premium when they make the transaction.
[Here is an example of currency black market happening today in Argentina.](
There is too much profit to be made if Bitcoin were made illegal for it to be ignored.

I bought an $8 ($12 with shipping) case fan on TigerDirect with BTC. The purchase worked flawlessly and I got my fan in about a week. 
About a week after I got my fan....... I got an invoice from Tiger Direct in the mail saying I owe $12 USD due Feb 11th. Doesnt really make sense because everything was already paid for, obviously. 
I'm a bit unsure if I should contact customer support and resolve the issue. Or, I could just ignore the invoice. They do not have any way to charge me as I have not given them any payment information.

So Mtgox uses software that relies somewhat on the assumption that transaction ids are reliable.
Transaction ids turn out to be very unreliable because they are "malleable".
Mtgox is crucified when problems arise and Bitcoin itself gets zero criticism and people valiantly defend the infallibility of the Bitcoin protocol.
This "malleable transaction id" issue is now spreading, creating issues across other exchanges. Now Bitstamp, much like Mtgox, has suspended Bitcoin withdrawals. 
Much of the comments here are still crucifying Mtgox, while lauding Bitstamp and Bitcoin. Meanwhile "malleable transactions ids" are tanking exchanges and tanking Bitcoin value left and right while [tarnishing the crptocurrencies validity in the media.](
Meanwhile you have people in this subreddit claiming malleable transactions ids either don't need fixed or can't be fixed. Along with Greg Maxwell claiming this "isn't even in the top 10 list of Bitcoin issues".


This community would make me proud if it did the following things:
* malleable transaction id's are an issue and it needs a solution. It IS A LARGE CONCERN. Bitcoin is not infallible. If part of it is broken, we admit that and then we fix it.
* Mtgox is incompetent at worst, likely not malicious. They have their flaws but they need not be demonized for saying there is something wrong with Bitcoin.
* Why applaud Bitstamp for doing the exact same thing Mtgox did. This highlights the real issue, malleable transaction ids are to blame here.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:41:18


I admit I don't fully understand the technical issue; but you make good sense of it here. If the transaction is unconfirmed, then the txn id is not part of the blockchain, thus there is no consensus. Makes perfect sense.
I doesn't make sense to me is how a single transaction can be changed to create two different transaction hashes.
Either way, if there is literally no workable solution that can be implemented then the solution is simple. Transaction ids need to be eliminated or hidden. If it is exploitable on such a scale as it currently is - then you need to fix the exploit or make changes that would make such exploits useless.

The future of Bitcoins and BFL are unpredictable.
Your argument presents itself as if you can foresee the future.
Maybe pre-ordering from BFL will be a mistake for most people, but maybe it won't. It's risk vs. reward.

Does anyone have any information on the blockchain.info "Cash Deposit" option?
It says you can deposit using cash with Bitinstant. How exactly does this service work? How legitimate is it? Is this equivalent to "buying bitcoins?" Also, wasn't this service just banned in Europe a few days ago? Thought I read something about that, if so, why?
Would you recommend it or is it something that should be avoided?
@_date: 2013-03-30 20:30:03
Perfect explanation! Thank you. Makes sense too. I might try it out soon.
Never heard of moneygram though, hopefully it is available in my area.
 
Also kind of curious how Bitinstant obtains their stockpile of Bitcoins that they sell. Maybe they have a decent mining operation going or something.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:26:46


Are you sure that is a given? Isn't that underestimating the influence of Gox on the market? Gox is the largest exchange by far. There is a lot of money, a lot of Bitcoins, and a lot of eyes on Gox right now.
The way I kinda see it, the market is almost in a stasis until Gox opens back up.
I do like the idea that the BTC value will settle roughly ~$30-$40 though, because that seems to be in-line with the normal average before the recent spike in valuation.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:29:28
Curious as to how you will determine payment. Say you want to be paid in BTC that is equal to USD for a similar job. 
So you request at the beginning of the job "I want X BTCs." Well it may take you weeks or months to develop a program, and X BTCs may be worth exponentially more, or less.

I missed the reasoning, why does everyone think there will be a mass sell-off / devaluation?
I'm by no means an expert, not even a novice, but my lines of thought are going like this:
Tons of people have sold off already in the past few days. Most people who are looking to sell, already sold. The price just a few days ago was as high as ~$260, it now sits roughly at ~$120. I don't see why anyone would want to sell off now, instead of holding.
Tons of people have been looking to buy in, but have been waiting for the price to drop. Well, it has dropped considerably.  While it may be true that past performance is no indicator of future performance, the past two weeks have shown us how bitcoin can rise exponentially.
It gets complicated because Bitcoin is not a stock, but many people are treating it like a stock...
Anyway the way I see it,  the current price is as low as BTC has been in weeks - and could potentially be the lowest it will ever be again. When I see ~$120 BTC, I'm thinking buy buy buy.  I'm also thinking there are a ton of people out there looking to buy at this price as well.
Anyway, when Gox is back up it will surely be swamped and there will be performance issues and market lag. I for one, expect the price to jump up, not down.

If he's smart enough to create Bitcoin, he's smart enough to use non-English websites and non-English currencies despite hypothetically being non-Japanese.

Let me just say that I'm choosing to continue mining anyway. Bitcoins are fascinating to me, and this seems to be the only way I can contribute to the experiment at the moment. One final question; though it is somewhat vague...
Investment. Say I finally get something into my Bitcoin wallet. Maybe .05 BTC, maybe 5 BTC, whatever. Is there anything significant I can do with those Bitcoins to further increase the amount of Bitcoins I have? I am aware that there seems to be a Bitcoin gambling system somewhere, but I'm talking about something with less risk.
Hypothetically, something like a "bank" where I can generate "interest". Or loaning. Something with a return of investment. What are the options?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:18:34


Well, there is risk involved in doing that. 
If you have all your money and bitcoins on Gox right now and trading is frozen, I don't think it would be prudent to dump money or scoop up BTCs from other exchanges. You don't know if BTC value is going to go up or down. 
There are other factors too. Maybe you aren't verified across multiple exchanges, maybe your bank is closed at the moment, maybe you can't get funds into the exchange in time, etc. Also, weren't some other exchanges also being ddos'd?
Don't get me wrong, you make an excellent point. But if it were me, I wouldn't make a single move until Gox, the largest exchange, is back online.
Anyway, I'm sure there ARE some people who DID buy all the BTCs they could at $&lt;80.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:16:00




Well sir, you are technically correct. But you are only describing the system as it currently exists. I think one of the points of the OP, as well as any rational human being, is that we need to change the current system. We need to make it so that your claims are no longer correct, at least in most cases.
Hypothetically speaking, there is no reason why we couldn't invent a new light bulb, with full luminosity, that lasts 100 or even 1000 years. It could be magnitudes more efficient too, and even cheaper to produce than current bulbs. I know that all sounds very farfetched for our current level of technology, but the premise is the same - there is currently little economic force/reasoning to create a lasting product, entire industries operate solely on the dependence of product failure. You remove product failure and you cripple demand.
There is a dynamic that is going on. Mass production/ Mass waste VS. recycling efficiency / product durability. If the former "wins", that could mean the end of a habitable planet and the end of the human race.

I've considered using middlecoin lately. But I haven't seen any concrete evidence that it is worth the switch from mining just LTC. Theoretically it SHOULD be more profitable using middlecoin, but I haven't seen a convincing argument/evidence yet.

but on a fanless, 3x2 inch, usb powered board? 300Mhash/s!  
The, ehem, BFL 5GHash/s miner is $274. That's roughly $00.06 per Mhash/s. If it is reasonable to apply a similar price per Mhash to this USB miner.... thats about $18 dollars. That'd be great.

While I understand that specialized hardware can perform certain tasks faster (Asics &gt; fpga, gpu), I do not take a tiny .jpg and unsubstantiated claims of 300Mhash/s very seriously.
I'll believe this thing does 300Mhash/s when I see one doing it, or at least see some evidence.

Well then. I've seen many warnings not to use online wallets... Apparently blockchain.info is not even safe enough.
So, ideally you should use an an offline wallet on a computer that is not connected to the internet and that is not compromised by malware. Gotcha.
That brings up many questions; How do I set up an offline wallet? How do I transfer bitcoins **to** that wallet? How do I transfer bitcoins **from** that wallet? Wouldn't I still need to use an online wallet as a temporary mediator (ex: I obtain BTCs from an online source -&gt; transfer that to my online wallet -&gt; transfer from my online wallet to my offline wallet?). Perhaps most importantly, how do I ensure that I don't fuck up a transfer / storage / anything - and lose all my offline Bitcoins ? How can you "backup" offline wallets in case of computer failure?
Are there any comprehensive and definitive guides on this that I can follow?
@_date: 2013-05-01 21:23:32
People invest in Bitcoins. When the price drops, they are losing investment.
People freak out when they lose investment; rightly so. That surprises or confuses you, how exactly? People don't invest so that their money can vanish into thin air - they hope to make some sort of profit.
All else is irrelevant. It doesn't matter if they invested money they shouldn't have. It doesn't matter if they are speculating. It doesn't matter if they are privileged to participate in such an experiment. 
People aren't allowed to be upset at a price drop because *you* say so?
How about you build a lego house and some other asshole kid comes and smashes it to shit. God forbid you freak out - you should be grateful you got to participate in such a great experiment.

I don't claim to completely understand ASICs but uhhh....
I'm having a hard time believing that tiny little thing, powered via usb, is going to pump out 300Mhash/s....
By comparison, some FPGA hardware give 300MHash/s for nearly half a grand. Or a Radeon 5830 can give you 300MHash/s for over a hundred bucks, but that ain't powered by USB...
Guess I'd like to see the price of this thing.
