Any benefits of eth are negated if a typical user can't fully validate a node.  If a user can't fully validate a node they are trusting someone else and we've seen what happens when we outsource the trust in money.

It might not be readily apparent to noobs why a decentralized coin is essential but they will care when they realize that a small minority can change the rules on them.  As noobs become educated they will exit eth. 
If they don't care about decentralization (user sovereignty over their coins) and they want instant/cheap transactions then why not use paypal or visa?  *It's all about decentralization*.  Decentralization is the only unique feature that any coin can offer that can't already be provided by other databases.

So you get funds onto a lightning channel by getting transaction mined/confirmed into a block (this is the expensive part).  
After that, you can send/receive like a zillion transactions for little to no cost.  You can spend and receive those 'lightning funds' with *anyone, not just TorGuard*.
EDIT: emphasis on the fact that you can spend/receive 'lightning funds' with anyone that also uses the lightning network.  It is/will be awesome.

Why does there have to be one way to measure this?  Of course there doesn't.  It's painfully obvious that if a typical user can't sync a full eth node that he's not in control anymore.  There is significant risk with centralization and people that don't disclose that are, imo, not helping.


LN is months away, it's already being used successfully on main net, it won't be long before wallet software adopts it.  A coin needs additional layers built on top of it otherwise high transaction volume will be expensive, or centralized, or have inflation.  Why this is not obvious to all players is beyond me.

Bitcoin’s value is immutable store of value that can be transferred digitally without anyone’s permission.
The high fees per transaction is a temporary problem due to spamming and purposeful lagging (not shapeshift) to implement segwit. 
How would the other altcoins handle the volume of bitcoin? Their fees would go up or they would sacrifice decentralization or security. They don’t offer anything new. 
*When* LN is ready for users this will be a nonissue.

No, Bitcoin Core is just one software version for Bitcoin (albeit the most respected).  There is no "official" bitcoin software.  There are many different software versions.  You can create your own if you wanted but if your version breaks consensus with the others then it will not be bitcoin anymore, rather, it would be an altcoin.  For example, if your version doubled the max number of bitcoins from 21MM to 42MM then you would break consensus with the other nodes and be a different coin altogether.

To cash out into a different wallet there will be a transaction fee.  If you want to minimize that fee then you'll probably want to wait until the weekend when fees are the lowest.
If you want to buy dollars with your bitcoin then there will be an exchange fee, fee depends on the exchange.

@_date: 2017-12-19 07:00:35
What we have right now is almost hysteria of people wanting to get in and then they get turned off by the high transaction fees.  It's understandable.  At the same time you have MANY altcoins that see the problem, sell themselves as better because they're less expensive but in reality they're providing no real solutions (often bad *solutions*).  It's unfortunate but this is a wild west new frontier.  This stuff is really new and not ready for primetime high volume transactions.  Any altcoin saying otherwise is just flat out wrong.  I'm patient, my bitcoin is gold to me at the moment.  I'll start transacting with it like it's currency when LN is ready, hopefully soon!!

Have confidence that bitcoin has by far the best fundamentals of all the crypto out there: most decentralized, best minds improving it, most liquid, brand, the history.

Hardly.  Any altcoin's success against bitcoin will be its own failure.  All the coins suffer from the same problem which is that blockchains don't scale well at all (assuming you want it to remain decentralized).  If many people start to say, hey litecoin is cheap so let's start using that, then the transaction fees of litecoin will go up and bitcoin's will come down.
The fact is that bitcoin has the best fundamentals of all the coins.  It's the most decentralized, has the brightest minds working on improving it, name recognition, liquidity, doesn't have any pre-mine scams like many alts, largest network effect, it was the first and has the history.  If the fundamentals ever did change then I'll adapt but it's not even close at the moment.

Unfortunately coin base doesn’t value their customers as much as other service providers, they might be the most expensive option. 
I think for small amounts and short term time frames, keeping some coin on Coinbase is not too risky.
Exchange fees and bitcoin transaction fees are two different things. Exchange fees are the exchange for trading gov fiat for crypto currencies. Bitcoin transaction fees are basically making a bid to have your transaction placed into a block and confirmed by the network. It’s a powerful thing but it has limited space for security purposes to keep it resilient against potential attacks like from governments.
Transaction fees on bitcoin are usually the lowest on the weekends.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:58:07


Not a dumb question at all.  This is how I think of it, it's not perfect but it helps me.
Bitcoin transactions on-chain are kind of like the supreme court of the US.  The supreme court is cool because its decision is final and respected by users however it moves slower and it's more expensive to use. 
Bitcoin transactions using LN are kind of like basic contracts between 2 parties.  LN is great because it's fast, cheap, and more private (handshake deal?).  This is great but what if there's a disputes between the 2 parties, how can the users be sure the transactions be enforced correctly?
The clever guys found a way to enforce LN transactions on the main chain, that is, if the handshake deal between the 2 parties has a dispute, they can call upon the supreme court to mediate and settle the dispute.
Therefore the supreme court gets involved less often and the fees are much less for the users to transact.  *Instead of the supreme court getting a big cut on all the deals, it will get a much smaller cut on many more deals.*
Hope that helps.  Cheers!

Because bitcoin users are quite diverse but most all seem to agree that having a small block size is a valuable security aspect of the protocol.  Raising the block size just kicks the can down the road with very little upside and 2nd layer solutions like Lightning Network will make other coins look silly.  Currently bitcoin is more like gold as a store of value but will soon have currency abilities.

'BLOCKCHAIN'   a chain of blocks...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:39
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:33:31


But why stop at 20?  Why not a factor of 99?  The problem is that there would be many more chain splits.  Think about it, what happens when more than 1 miner finds a block *at the same time*?  Which block is the *real* block?  Once a block is found it's a race to propagate to other miners/nodes.  Meanwhile, more blocks are found by other miners and they're building on top of different chain-split blocks.  The node software declares that the valid blocks with the most proof of work will be considered the *real* chain of blocks and ignore all the other chain-split blocks.  What will happen to the transactions on the chain-splits?  They'll be ignored, like they never happened at all.
So if you have a blockchain that confirms blocks every 5 seconds, 1 confirmation will not be secure enough to know that coins are really yours.  Heck, 500 confirmations probably won't be enough.  It's really time that is needed with many blocks confirming that you really have the funds.
That's why bitcoin is every 10 minutes, it's a security feature.  If you've got 6 confirmations then you know you're good - the probability of chain splits is trivial.  But why is it 10 minutes and not 11 minutes or 9 minutes.  I don't know...

This becomes less of a thing with bitcoin. Bitcoin has a fixed supply and is therefore _deflationary_ - the goods of the world will continue to increase while the supply of btc stays the same. Saving money is incentivized, the purchasing power of bitcoin increases.   The need to borrow money decreases dramatically.  
Btc holders can’t continue to print btc and lend it out creating generations of debtors. They are very different from the banks of today. 


Bitcoin will do to banks and credit cards what the internet did to fax machines - make them less relevant. Sure they might exist.

Even if everyone’s money increased proportionally at the same time, the effect still wouldn’t be the same for everyone. Some will benefit and some will lose out.
Just because the stock of money increased proportionately that doesn’t mean the prices of goods and services increased the same way - there’s quite a lag there. And really, it’s likely that many people that wake up to double the money in their account will change their spending habits - like in nonessential things causing prices to rise in that market segment more quickly than essential things (new car vs butter). 
The last users to spend the new money will be buying things at higher prices since the prices will have had an opportunity to adjust.

@_date: 2017-10-22 12:40:08
Because of the security feature of having a limited block size, there is limited space for transactions and we have generally seen the fees increasing over time. They increase because there are more users of bitcoin than there is available space for transactions in a block. 
Obviously high user fees has consequences so rather than compromise the base security feature, second layer protocols, such as the lightning network, are being built on top of bitcoin to enable more affordable transactions. Basically, it’s like paying for a traditional bitcoin transaction that enables limitless other transactions on a second level.  It might be a few months to a year before an end user will be able to participate in something like the lightning network.

When you buy/sell on most exchanges then you are identified to the coins you bought. Bitcoin is quite traceable, despite being in cold storage. What you do between the buy and the sell can make it more messy to track but it's still doable.  I can't imagine the IRS wants to spend their time prosecuting small gains because they will spend more money trying to collect than they will eventually collect. 
What I think would be difficult to trace would be buying goods and services with bitcoin, but buying dollars with bitcoin makes their job pretty easy. There are many hodlers that are waiting for the day when it's common for goods and services to be traded using bitcoin.

There will never be a time when everything will be fully automated. You continue to fail to recognize this important point. Like I said previously, humans have *unlimited* wants. For example, I want to vacation to Proxima Centauri but humans are hundreds if not thousands of years away from making it possible to take a brief vacation the the nearest solar system. After vacationing PC, I want to vacation a different galaxy. We have infinity years of automation ahead of us to satisfy our infinity wants. Today’s labor will be automated for the wants that are not yet possible. With each new advancement humans move the goal posts - the cycle continues indefinitely. Humans discover an automation to save labor, labor has to adapt, excess labor can now focus on satisfying the next immediate want of the market that wasn’t previously possible, humans discover another automation technique...

No doubt the owners of the machines will get the profits/losses - no debate there, but it’s also besides the point. 
What you may fail to be considering is how individuals will be enriched by having the automation in existence (not necessarily owning it). Automation reduces labor and therefore enables goods and services to be less expensive and yet more prevalent than without automation. 
You have been enriched by using the internet which has automated communications and protocols despite not owning the hardware that makes it work.

It means miners get a smaller cut of *each* transaction but assuming there are exponential more users than today they will collect more fees overall.

Changes can be proposed trivially by anyone.  *How* those changes are accepted *by the users* is the prime issue.

Then they take your paper and promise to give you access to your money digitally.  Years later they tell you it's basically impossible to take out any significant amounts of paper.

When creating a transaction, the wallet software determines what the transaction fee needs to be to get into a block.  There are are all kinds of charts out there about transaction fees. 
Miners would prefer higher fees. There is a limit to how many transactions can fit into a block. This is done purposefully as a security measure. In order to stay decentralized and resilient from hostility, the block size needs to be small. There many projects underway to use secondary layers on top of bitcoin to enable a tremendous amount of transactions for tiny transaction fees without sacrificing bitcoin’s decentralization. 
Currently, about 20% of the miner reward for discovering a block comes from transaction fees. It’s expected that transaction fees will replace the value of newly minted bitcoins and this will happen in the relatively near future.

I think you've fallen victim from repeated falsehoods about what makes a chain valuable in the first place.  A chain is ~~less secure~~ worthless when changes can be made in a centralized manner.

And you can own these businesses that own the machines by purchasing their stock. It’s not like they hug it and keep it all to themselves - not that’s there’s anything wrong with that. It’s just more profitable for everyone to have stock owners. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 22:23:04
“And it's assuredly more profitable to be a direct owner than a stock owner”
Come on now... the owner of stock is a... direct owner and has rights to the assets, the earnings, and the losses. 
“where would a person who isn't already wealthy get that money to purchase stock?”
Purchasing stock regularly is very doable for most everyone that lives in a relatively free nation. 
You’re coming off as sour grapes, someone that values equality before freedom - socialism or communism, which end up with neither equality nor freedom.

Automation frees up labor to invent the next level of automation. The levels of automation are infinite because our wants infinite. You have a job because there are new layers of automation yet to be discovered and brought to market. 
This is like a person from the Middle Ages asking us why we need money when we have all this amazing stuff today. 
As an aside, to live as well as someone did back in the Middle Ages, you’d never have to have a job. That’s how much we’ve been enriched so far and it’s likely to only get better. 
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:34:15


Yes it does. All stock companies pay dividends, it’s just a matter of when - and they make their intention known in the periodic financial reports. Your rights to the assets can vary and are defined in scope but you do have rights. Stock holders (owners) hire the board of directors that represents the best interest of its owners collectively. The BOD hires Management to carry out the owners best interests. The owners get the feast or famine of the assets. You’re free to sell out of or buy into whatever company you like that best satisfies your needs. So it’s true, you don’t have the right to order Management and sell yourself the assets penny on the dollar, nonetheless, you still have ownership in the assets. 


...meaning to own your own business I presume. Being an employer *can* have more upside potential. But so what? What’s stopping others from being self employed? 


I don’t disagree, but so what?. Tell me, how can so many be employed today? So many jobs have been eliminated throughout history so how can so many be employed? You fail to recognize that *those* jobs disappear but new ones open. How many airplane pilots existed in the 1800s? 


Jobs don’t disappear overnight, the signs are obvious, they should prepare accordingly. Outdated labor is purged and wisely so.

The English System is inferior in most ways.  
For length, there is an advantage in using 12 inches to the foot - 12 can be divided by 2, 3, 4 or 6 so it makes some calculations easier - I've noticed this in carpentry.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value. The evidence for this is clear when you consider a person commuting suicide - they don’t value their life nor anything else in the world. Water, shelter, food, and bitcoin are all *worthless* to a person that’s going to end it all. Value is 100% subjective to each individual. Sure, some things like water is valuable to most people but not to everyone. 
I think it’s an important distinction.
