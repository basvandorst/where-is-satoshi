It looks much more streamlined than the 1.xx versions. I do not believe it looks like an adware program. Compare to interfaces of other security software venders today. 
One of the primary issues people had with the 1.xx versions was the interface (mind you, not a functional issue, but an aesthetic issue). We took a lot of feedback to heart and our design team did a stellar job in my opinion.
TL;DR: I may be biased, but I think it looks awesome.

I don't think you remember 1.xx very well then. :) One of the chief complaints is that the UI looked antiquated.
Edit: I'm also hoping you can be more specific. What about MBAM 2.0 looks like the way you describe, but isn't present in ESET 7?
All feedback is greatly appreciated.

Perhaps I just don't personally understand why MBAM 2.x looks *horrible* but ESET 5 (why not upgrade to 7?) doesn't. I'm sorry..

Please keep in mind that this is all my personal opinion and not a reflection of the Malwarebytes company.
Okay so what I'm interpreting from what you presented is this:
 You think varying colors makes an interface look flashy.
You reference tools created many years ago that were developed by individual people. Many -don't even have- a graphical user interface. HijackThis looks antiquated as does MBAM 1.xx.
We didn't develop the new interface because we ran out of better things to do. It was the primary complaint by our customers about our software. Honestly the rogue examples you present are incredibly 'flashy' to a level that MBAM 2.0 doesn't even approach. The same style of buttons is present in ESET7 but you think it is cleaner since it's gray? The blue in MBAM 2.0 is the same blue as the company logo and website. The green buttons appears to be the industry standard for that type of button/indicator. 
I respectfully disagree with your assertion.

Thank you for the suggestion! We hope many people use this new payment method. :)

Thank you for the feedback. I'll be sure to point the design/marketing folks toward this.

Thank you for your feedback.
So part of what I take issue with in these comments is that displaying "you are safe" is akin to rogues. No, that is not the case. Rogues flash "YOU ARE INFECTED...."
We have had overwhelmingly positive reviews of our new UI. 
What did you think of our previous UI?
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:13:39
I can definitely see that.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:45:22
Thank you! We appreciate this very much.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:25:37
I'm sorry to hear you think it looks horrible. What other security software do you use, if I may ask?
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:44:46
Okay, take care!
