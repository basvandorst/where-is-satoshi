When you go to the tab "Addresses" you can see all the addresses currently generated in the wallet. If an address has been used it would be moved into "Used" section and it won't be seen by default.
If you find the address in question there you should be able to see the Bitcoin in your wallet.

May not be contentious at some point.

Cool, which site has this?

Who says anything about 4-8MB right now. Create a HF code. Publish it in a Core release with 2 year time to kick in. Get miners on board because there would be a fixed way for onchain scaling as they want. Get SegWit right now. Looks like no brainer to me but apparently I'm missing something....
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:27:41
I cannot speak for Core devs but it's not about HF per se but about a contentious HF. The difference is a HF is contentious in the beginning but at some point may become no brainer and it is the only way forward.

I've been at the exact same place two days ago as you are today. First, SegWith IS an on-chain block size increase. It effectively makes the space in the block more valuable, so the transaction's size that counts would be smaller but there would be more transactions in a block so the fees theoretically will be higher for the miners. The increase is between 1.75 to 4MB. Simultaneous increase to 2MB via a HF is not feasible because it would make the blocks up to 8MB in size which the network cannot handle at this time nor it is certain it would be able to handle 5 years from now. It would be risky and would make no sense to do this blindly without getting some data from SegWit first.

Maybe this?
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:29:56
Spammers got better at spamming. It's not just about the mempool being empty, it's about the cost of a transaction to be included in a block. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:13:11
If SegWit crashes in fire on mainnet the future HF would be the least of our concerns and there would be a HF at once. Still the devs agreed on this schedule in the first place. SegWit first with HF code in a release, remember? 
SegWit is ready where is the HF code? It's not needed now, OK, when it would be needed? When it would be ready? Is this a change of plans checked with the miners who explicitly wanted HF code?
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:33:25
Not only miners but yeah, miner centralisation has been a huge problem that went unnoticed because they were not uncooperative until now.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:59:50
No it doesn't. In HongKong the miners agreed to run Core with HF code that is not active and support SegWit. HF may be executed in the future, only the code is needed.

Run the latest version of Bitcoin Core to enforce the consensus rules.

+1 from Core supporter here.
I remember Jihan saying he would not run SegWit without hard fork code present in a release. So he just stood by his word, so if 2MB hard fork would make the mining community support SegWit I think it's worth it.
I realise this hard fork is not technically needed with SegWit available but it's needed for compromise which is also very important otherwise the users would just leave the ecosystem. Core devs continuously the users should decide, well they do so. Like Andreas says there are 2 ways to vote. 1 speech - there are talks and talks bigger blocks are needed and nothing has been delivered.
2 exit - that begins to happen now.
I am a firm Core supporter and I would not support any other implementation that is available because Core has done an outstanding job ensuring the stability of Bitcoin for years. That's why they should take into consideration the demands of the other players in the system and prepare an technical update for that.
If SegWit + 2MB hard fork is what's needed to reach consensus then Core should take that chance, otherwise many more would choose option 2
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:19:48
Current situation escalated way above that point. Now HF seems the only feasible way out, the question is who initiates it and who would be properly prepared for it.
@_date: 2017-04-01 21:51:12
Technically they are different but the idea is the same. It's an interesting idea but it has one major flaw - increases centralisation too much. Basically it puts the power on the big miners how will be able to mine larger blocks and by doing this they would bankrupt the small miners who can't afford the more expensive infrastructure to support them + the nodes that run on older hardware and slower internet connection wouldn't cope and would be pushed out as well.
@_date: 2016-09-13 11:37:35
Well, there aren't specific versions there, but the column "SegWit Support (11%)" should indicate 0.13.0 block I guess

The Trezor firmware is open-source. Read it yourself to verify that or hire someone to do so. Personally I trust the guys that have reviewed it so far and it is clean.

Every single miner benefits from the current high fees. It doesn't matter if the miner is hostile, cooperative, friendly or bully. They all have to stay afloat no matter what so they normally would be pretty opposed to a chain split. 
Now, for the users there are two options. 
1) Status quo, which will definitely lead to more altcoin usage (already happening big time) and less Bitcoin usage which would lead to smaller fees/reward for the miners. Now when this reward they seek is gone, they would have to update the protocol to stay relevant. By this time Bitcoin may have less than 20% of the crypto market cap. That is of course the case when the miners are greedy and the incentive system works as expected.
2) Option two is for the users to split into an updated coin that they value more because it offers more features and lower fees, so it totally makes sense for them to seek that. Now, how can they attract miners, well, BIP148 coin would be higher priced due to user demand and the miners, if greedy, should mine that. The flow of power is Users -&gt; economy -&gt; miners. Users are extremely hard to coordinate though because they are very distributed, that's the whole value in Bitcoin. Should the users be not that distributed we are left with "economy -&gt; miners" which is no different that the central banks.

Agree. This one time it may be ok though. We get SegWit now and in 1 year Bitcoin chain splits and both chains have SegWit. One with 1MB limit and one with 2MB limit. This is fine though as a chain split in inevitable IMO, just a matter of time.

E9 is 140W/TH, hopefully E9 Plus would be closer to 100W/TH
