I think the issue would be more lost the private keys as opposed to losing the passwords.
Mark is a dedicated PHP programmer so it's viable he created a method to store the keys without testing it first and can't get them back, hypothetically speaking.
It's also possible he stored them on an external drive which went missing or was stolen.
I don't think Mark is silly enough to simply lose a password, but hey, it's possible.

I followed transactions of theirs which included a 500,000 transaction. Most of the coins were further moved around and probably cashed out or stored elsewhere down the line. The two wallets which I've found that actually contained the Bitcoins and have been untouched for 3 years are hyper linked within the article.

I believe it's very possible they've lost the private keys.

Maybe the wrong choice of words. Perhaps saying a man who is known for programming everything in PHP would be more relevant.

I lied in the OP to begin with, I wrote the article myself, I just wanted to see the responses without outing myself. They look promising haha.
I spent a while going through transactions but failed to find more coins. I'm sure in the near future they'll be more Gox discoveries.

The blogger template is programmed very bizarrely I admit. Accessing the website from a mobile device works perfectly fine. Apologies for this. I'll resolve this asap.

Everything is going to be an assumption until there's hard evidence from Gox to back up what's actually gone on. It's one thing to claim something has happened but it's another to prove it.

I think it's more of an embarrassment to the company if this is the case. 
It's a lot easier to tell the media and the world that you were hacked and the victim of a bug rather than saying you misplaced $300M USD~

The javascript aspect of the site runs the widgets such as the random post generator at the top and the widgets on the side. 
I'll work on creating a non JS mode now.

I wrote that because I don't want to claim it to be 100% and be incorrect. I strongly believe my theory is correct.

The URL you gave was incorrect. Which address are you referring to?
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:17:00
Theoretically it is possible but would never be possible due to the amount of time taken which I guess you could say makes it impossible. Mindfuck eh?
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:45:27
Thanks, I appreciate it. Glad you enjoyed the read :)

Haha glad you got that resolved!
Unfortunately numerous people have looked into private keys before and they theoretically could be brute forced. Here's some more info ;

It says proof they're lying which my article does prove. My article contradicts a lot of statements they've made which I'd say backs up the title but I guess a more appropriate title would have been ** - if my theory is correct.

I agree with you, I'm fixing the JS issue now and apologies.
