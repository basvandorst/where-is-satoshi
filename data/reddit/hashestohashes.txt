they must have taken that "bitcoin cash is bitcoin" thing seriously

yep but still, 1 BTC + 1 BCH != 2 BTC
@_date: 2018-09-08 21:48:57
fair enough. your last sentence is anyway rather unfortunate.

alive. buying more for less. tbh, attempted a little short too (with a tight stop though, I guess/hope it wont work out)

less profit =&gt; less miners (though I think this is not necessarily the case); less miners =&gt; less difficult to mine =&gt; more people can afford to mine =&gt; eventually will reach an equilibrium with profitability.

not really, from what I understood. when the last coin will be minted (the 21millionth), and it will, transaction fees will be the reward. we will be dead anyway by then though.

you can read it quite well on github itself e.g. 
the best technical read I've had over the last couple of years.

Its sad, that not even the posts get reposted, but also the fking comments....
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:11:10
sure, that's the natural option. somewhat like how I guess localbitcoins works. was curious to know what alternatives are people using for this though.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:33:11
it was kinda obvious that this was going to happen xDD*

jeez, sarcasm can be dangerous when it comes to downvotes..
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:29:06
nice holiday to you sir. classy.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:12:46
i cant do sarcasm apparently.

that long sequence of words (24 I guess?) is the seed. from that, you are able to recreate your keys and control the funds linked to the addresses generated. no need to install a specific wallet (any would do) and most importantly nothing of all that is on any machine outside of your control (unless you get hacked) which is pretty much the point of the whole thing. welcome to the rabbithole.

looks like it.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:27:18
how about keykeeping hygiene? lame question probably, and i guess the answer is no, but I am wondering whether there alternative methods to eg make a small transfer to a new address, or recreate the wallet from the seed? what are the good practices re hw wallets?

my 2 sats: get Mastering Bitcoin  and see how approximate my answer was.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:25:17
I laughed hard.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:13:21
thats a great answer, mate. thumbs up.
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:16:12
smell of fud is strong on this one
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:51:26
but maybe he has enough supercomputers dedicated to brute-force the SN keys
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:12:36
well said
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:25:00
me too dude. don't feel bad about it.

in layman terms, your node receives a (tiny) fee as reward for routing a ln tx
