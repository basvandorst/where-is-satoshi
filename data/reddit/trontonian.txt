It's back up. You never lose until you stop hodling
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:19:30
When it's low, buy. When it's high, sell. Discipline yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:21:19
so you wanted to sell low and buy high?
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:05:01
When nuclear war erupts you have bigger problems then bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:06:43
Bro stop making these posts it's getting annoying. I know you work for Goldman Sachs to drive the price down to buy tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:23:27
:) HODL

There are two kinds of futures.
Long - Contracts gamble that BTC will increase. BTC increases, they profit.*
Short - Contracts gamble that BTC will decrease. BTC decreases, they profit.*
* More complicated, but that's the gist of it.
The worry is because banks can manipulate Bitcoin. They can buy tons of BTC to inflate the prices to 20k. Then they might buy tons of short contracts, and sell all their BTC, tanking the price. Then their short contract wins, and they profit.
Or they can buy long contracts, and buy a shitton of bitcoin to drive up the price, then after the contract they sell.

I mean looking at the media and the interviews, they look like hyenas ready to pounce
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:27
Banks can make 100 short contracts while individuals buy 1 long contract. But banks have more power than individuals.

move bitcoin to coinsquare.io
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:51:39
This actually makes sense. Wall st wants to pump and dump but the non hodlers ruined that
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:27:02
ay fuck off. buy now, we're skyrocketing to the moon
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:17:31
check the prices again. Bounce back babbbbyyy
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:22:35
I don't think anyone would short BTC. Yes wall st investors hate BTC, but no one would take that risk. If you figure out how shorting works, the potential damages can never stop. 
No one knows where bitcoin will go. But they don't want to take the chance of it skyrocketing even more.

Well only on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:28:53

@_date: 2017-12-10 14:48:40
Yep you can. Even if they can't, banks have offshore accounts.

Why is quadrigacx's prices always lower than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:24:19

The newly appointed governor is bitcoin friendly. That's what the article says. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:10:46
Holy crap, I never thought about it that way- owners buy, loyal followers buy, owners sell. Same thing....

PayPal probably wasn't spoofed by Roger Ver. The email attacked all  cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:10:22
SwissBorg was a massive ad campaign.

I deleted it because the automod in won't let me mention other cryptocurrencies. It autoremoved my post because it thought it was off topic.
