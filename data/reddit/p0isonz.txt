Miners get tx fees not as a reward but an incentive to put that transaction in the next block they mine. A full node on bitcoin wont get u anything, however coins like Dash or Bulwark have Masternodes which do what u want. There is a high initial payment however to make a master node, u need a certain amount of coins
@_date: 2018-01-19 08:17:18
Actually LN and SegWit and other stuff that add-on to bitcoins original code is satoshis vision. Increasing blocksize isn't due to us needed 1GB blocks to actually cope and people like to treat the original BTC code as God. So in short addons = good. Changing code = bad

Ye, well nothing was prepared due to this being unexpected. By 2019 Bitcoin conjection won't even be heard of, lightning and segwit are just the start. Until Q2 2017 scaling was all done on Satoshis part and I guarantee he never thought of this, 10 year old technology isn't going to be great now is it...

Ethereum isn't struggling. Tx times are relatively quick and fees are still low, but large things such as cryprokitties did overload the network which woulf happen on any crypto. Bitcoin and Ethereum have issues cause they have 10x the load that other cryptos have. Ethereum however can still be reworked and improved and noone can say that its not the founders wish cause the founder is still here

Hes not against bitcoin alone, hes against cryptocurrencys. The blockchain can prove a valuable item for him and other company's, but bitcoin and cryptoCURRENCIES are a threat to his business. People get paid in crypto in quite a few places and once bitcoin is ready to use easily and costlessly, segwit + lightning, the number will increase. I have always been extremely fascinated in cryptos and feel they have the power to take over, just my 2c

Ethereum isn't a currency, its a platform. Its what, one day, governments, private messaging clients, exchanges, visas, etc will run on. Imagine this, you unlock your house by sending a token to your house door. The token has no value, its just a way to open your door. Ethereum has the potential to have a smart contract for every house and designate a different token for it. Someone wants to deliver something to ur house but your not home, send them one of your tokens for one time access
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:25:13
Terrible way to say "You're right"
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:43:27
At the current rate we are heading, needing an internet connection won't be that big of a problem. On a blockchain you can give someone say 1 token so they can only unlock ur door once, eg. Postman. I'm all for NFC doors, technology is technology, but their are just so many exploits and afaik, there are non atm for blockchains and if ethereum gets LN or something else, speed isnt a problem and neither is congestion. I don't understand why some people are so against technology like this for no reason

Its like social media. Instagram and Snapchat, snapchat was already doing stories well and people were happy using insta nd snapchat for different things, then insta came and added stories. How many people prefer insta stories over snap, its just a waste of man power that can be put to add things that aren't already done/done well. Sure most altcoins are stupid, but ether has been here for a while and does tokens great already, there are even tools to make an ether token in 5 mins, easy right. Bitcoins will be used for monetary transactions, but we should leave ether to tokens, unless bitcoin finds a significantly better way to do it, for example not having to add tokens and a better way to handle it. For now, until bitcoin has monetary transactions perfect, leave ether to do its thing. My 2c

3) The whole Brian Armstrong + Roger Ver insider trading scam
4) It isn't needed nor will it ever be, especially with lightning right around the corner
5) It has led to a fork frenzy with one nearly every other week now
6)They decided to use Bitcoin in the name for fame instead of working hard to create fame for themself like litecoin, dash, ripple etc.

I don't think 32mb blocks is realistic imo. And Bitcoin Cash hasn't been fully tested because of the fact that bch gets &lt; 100000 tx a day and btc gets over 400000 (avg). Currently we do have SegWit meaning that we can cope for the next 12 months without lightning fully implemented, but I said under 12 months meaning that its not going to be 12 months, 12 months is just a maximum timeframe imo considering its already been deployed on main net. Along with Lightning the Litecoin Foundation is working on a way in which bitcoin transactions can be sent on litecoin network and vice versa which allows both coins to join the network that's fastest and has lowest fees. I agree that BCash is a current workable solution but it shouldn't be the solution we are looking for
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:31:44
To cope with mass adoption u need 1gb blocks and the fact is the network cannot cope with even 32mb. Raising block size affects the network too...
SegWit is already activated and Core is prioritising the addition in the gui meaning mass adoption
Lightning Network is already deployed on mainnet, this means in  under 12 months LN will be activated
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:16:06
Exactly. People don't understand that if u wanna go with BCash method, u need 1GB blocks mine to cope with mass adoption. BCash has no need in this world, we need workable solutions like SegWit and Lightning
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:28:53
These are the bandwidth requirements of full nodes, which would increase causing the full node count to be reduced. And you already know, in a sense, nodes are more important than hash power as they are the ones that verify that the blockchain is following the rules. Even with the longest Proof-of-Work chain, nodes will still determine if said chain follows the rules and whether or not it is accepted or ignored.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:26:24
Yes please
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:59:17
Its better than 1gb blocks lol, besides Cores GUI adoption of segwit will help other devs understand how ro implement and also bring segwit to the wider community. Lightning has now also been deployed on mainnet. The problem of Bitcoin Network congestion was brought up this year, so I feel that by the end of 2018, segwit will be widely adopted and lightning will be available to use and most users will use it

Incorrect. Ethereum did 1mil once. And ethereum is not a fucking currency. Think about all the ICO's that happen with ethereum, that's how many transactions are needed

After some research I did on what quantum computers are capable of, its seems to me that they can calculate private keys from public keys. Currently computers would take too long to do that but quantum computers may be able too. Centralised services can change, but with miners who don't want to make their mining farms useless, how are we going to change the encryption method to a different one in this case?

If lightning is too centralised it will be edited. That's the power of open source

Not if you send to the wrong wallet

It wasn't ironic

The comment ratings say otherwise

Code changed on the same network consensus. Segwit has contributed a whole lot to the bitcoin fee issue. Just because it didn't directly lower fees doesn't mean it didn't have an effect on it

8MB Blocks
If they fill up, larger blockchain, less people have disk space to have a full node. Less people have a copy of the blockchain. Defeats the decentralisation goal and makes it centralised

Don't forget to add that BCash is more centralised

What's in it for me, spending months to make a wallet that I will not profit off of at all. I am making this wallet for the sole reason of helping the community so I am not going to pay someone to do a little part of a giant project that I am doing for free. You may not be generous enough to help or support a community that has the product but not the tools to use them, but don't insult the human race with your mindset. Many people are perfectly happy to help because the community needs help. And incentive - if more people can use bitcoin, doesn't that mean the price goes up?

He sold at 20$ and now sits and watches us complain about 5k

Dk why you are getting dv. Is a genuine question.
A ledger / trezor never let's your computer come in contact with the private keys or anything else. Your computer sends a message to the hardware wallet that has the amount you want to send and the address and you type your pin etc on the wallet which signs the transaction and send it back to the computer signed which then broadcasts it. A USB drive on the other hand could have a virus that waits for you to unlock and then steals your private keys
