No, only those that you have mentioned. And yes, nerdmaster02 is right, post is about buy order on bitcoin, currently 79 coins at 11698.50 euro.

So just to be clear, because i don't know if I understand lightning correctly - I have to open a channel for a fee that is about equal to a medium bitcoin free on-chain, then i have to freeze some of my assets in this channel, lets say a 1 bitcoin.
From this moment till i close this channel, that is opened with a single seller / institution (like here with a coffee shop), i cannot use any of that one bitcoin elsewhere, yes?
So its gonna be great for companies like pay processors, but for a single user that is not able to freeze assets like, lets say, 8 future energy bills its not quite useful, yes?
Or do i understand all this in a wrong way?

Letter states, that bank is closing account within 30 days (notice period stated in contract) and that they are asking account owner to provide new account number to transfer remaining funds. Until account closure You can freely withdraw or transfer funds as far as I know. You can read more [here]( - link to comments and source in polish.

Same situation in Poland. For now the hot topic is "BZWBK closing a private account over a nonstandard (nonstandard way is, as bank says, an exchange, currency exchange etc) cryptocurrency purchase". Some banks wont let you open a company account if you are going to be a crypto trader. Banks are telling us, that even that trading crypto is not illegal, it could be used to launder money and they cannot verify all sources of cash flowing into traders account.

Banks are telling us, that even that trading crypto is not illegal, it could be used to launder money and they cannot verify all sources of cash flowing into traders account, so they choose to just close it down. Such a nice way to say "fuck you"...
