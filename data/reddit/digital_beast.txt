I thought mods could shadowban people in their own subreddit. It's intended to get rid of spammers.

I think there were other factors last year. There was China going on and the fact that some investment groups set up bitcoin based funds probably got a lot of play in the mainstream media.
Yesterday (day before?) there was that server farm melt down that probably took a bunch of bitcoin permanently out of circulation. This global seizures are probably taking another big chunck out of circulation at least for the next several months. So, that could account for the slight upward edging.
Where you might see some media driven rise is if comedy central and those types jump on these seizures... after all, silk road gets busted and the guy spins up the same business model?  AND includes the feds in his admin staff? AND uses his IRL email address for the servers?  I bet even the Feds at some points questioned if they were being punked somehow. After reading some of the news articles and the filing... it sounds like the only way he could have made it easier for them is if he'd have actually rented server space from them.

It's an open source software. As long as there are people willing to continue updates, not sure how they'd stop the development (even if they could justify it in some legal way).
OpenBazaar isn't targeted to drug trade as far as I've read. The few people that I've seen talk about using it basically sound like Etsy types. So, OpenBazaar is more of an Amazon, Etsy, Ebay competitor than a SRx.0 competitor.

That may be true in buying/selling items (like trying to sell a house before a market crash). 
But with a bitcoin bubble the looser is the economy of what ever currency you exchange it for (because, the exchange itself is paid off in the transaction). My few BTC are not going to hurt the multi-trillion USD economy... at least, not in a way that I will loose sleep over.

They clearly had him since prob about late June (they mirrored the server late May, that gives them a month to do analysis). My tin-foil hat is buzzing something about holding off the bust until after the election in order to give bitcoin a black eye so that those unhappy with the election will stay away from all the cocaine/kiddyPorn bitcoins.
Of course, it could work the opposite way and bring it up into the news at a time when a lot of people have had it with the mainstream and they think... let me look closer at this bitcoin stuff.
Psychologically, familiarity causes people to be less resistant (even like stuff more) to ideas. So, when Costanza left his hat in that woman's apartment, he just needed to get in a total of about 7 contacts for her to start considering him a part of her 'personal life' instead of viewing him as an outsider.
Unlike last year, this year if the bust spins out articles about bitcoin they will also be able to include all those retailers who adopted it over the last year and it would be nice to see OpenBazaar get coverage as an Amazon/Ebay competitor for the small producers.  It would be great timing if the retailers also had bitcoin specific Christmas sales.

Actually, you really aren't. **If you'd been committed to those values, you would have engaged a security consultant to go over your IT systems at the same time as you put it in your logo.**

Find an online mortgage calculator to verify this with your specific situation, but generally, if you pay an additional principle payment equal to 1% of your original principle each month, you will have your mortgage paid off in less than 7 years. So, it is far better to pay down principle than to pre-pay mortgage payments IF you are comfortable that you'll be able to make those payments.
As an example: If your original principle on your mortgage is $100k, then you would pay an additional $1k against the principle each month.
My vote is for you to do what you feel most comfortable with.

Nope. In my opinion, if I am holding valid US Currency and they're not willing to accept that, then screw them. Now, if that machine provides change for $10k, then I can see the extra hoops... but, I'm not jumping through those hoops for $20 in BTC.

Actually all of their notebook catalog items are pulled directly from Amazon, so they probably are ordering it from Amazon. Their footer bar reads:

Yea. The first thing I thought is this will throw every NWO hater completely out of the idea of ever considering bitcoin. Too bad they didn't go with everyone everywhere.
@_date: 2013-09-12 23:47:58
None have been installed. So at the current time, they are not successful at all because they don't exist.  I think the first one is being installed in Nov.
@_date: 2013-09-11 08:20:08
Currency aside, these are things that I noticed (and I'm posting it because you asked for thoughts and ideas):
(a) I have no idea of what country you are in or who you are. There is no address anywhere on the site and you list an LLC that doesn't show up in web searches. There is no customer service phone number. These are all big red flags to me and I probably would not buy because of it.
(b) Your products do not provide a good description that include the manufacturer's name. You have a list of manufacturers on the left, but some of them have no products listed when I click on them.  For those with listed products, once I click on the product the manufacturer isn't identified in the product description itself. So, if I had gotten there through the top menu, then it would just be a pair of boots with no real descriptions on it.  (I looked at boots and some long johns)
(c) The storefront application (3dcart) pretty much stinks on my browser (firefox w/slower broadband). It pops around a lot and looks like a novice programmer made it.  There are a boat load of free applications out there to use, you should find a better one than this. BitPay has plugins for most major carts. I've used Zen Cart, osCommerce and Drupal Ubercart. All of them have tighter, more professional looking implementations than 3Dcart.
(d) The navigation (e.g. consumables shows two categories that I have to click one to get to any products) is annoying.  I can see some people thinking that you actually don't have any products under the category because the links don's stand out very much.  As a minimum, put an image there to make it more obvious that you need to hit another link.  Then one of the sub links under consumables is consumables again? Why not just list all of the products under the first click?
(e) For my area, your prices are not very competitive. But, I only looked at boots since that is something that I routinely buy online. (Also, without the manufacturer info, it is possible that you're offering some really high end boot that would be set at a good price?)
(f) Shipping... first time I tried to calculate it, it threw me back into the shopping area with zero items in my cart.  I put another item in the cart an tried again and your UPS ground shipping on a $9 (4oz) item calculated as $16.60 to my place (and the cart didn't provide a total including shipping... you really need to dump that 3dcart, it is terrible!)
(g) Search just doesn't work at all.
If you're paying for that store, you're getting ripped off badly and you need to pass these complaints back to them and demand your money back. Feel free to PM me if you want help setting up a professional looking site that will actually work correctly :-)
BUT -- you really need to let that hosting company know that their stuff isn't working at all. It looks and functions like something a bunch of kids in their first programming class would create. For all you know, you've been getting sales that were dumped at the point that they tried to calculate the shipping.
@_date: 2013-09-12 22:37:07


Well, that is certainly going to be a PITA.
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:57:49


This isn't really true. Their current payment systems are regulated by PCI standards. PCI standard require an isolated environment. Introducing a BitCoin payment processor would require one that has met all the PCI standards and who can provide immediate payment verification. 
Given the low adopotion rate of even other cards (Discover, AmEx) payment processors are the ones who need to incorporate BitCoin as a payment system. Even one transaction is relatively slow, imagine trying to process millions of transactions per second? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:43:48
I like how the announcement is made now, but they're not implementing it until the end of 2014. How about you go and implement the payment system, then announce it. Instead of trying to glom onto bitcoin news traffic.

So, what is a halving day? And where is this party?
@_date: 2013-09-13 12:38:17
Prior to this policy change, how much had you donated to the Bitcoin Foundation?
@_date: 2013-09-11 11:00:23
First, thank you for not becoming defensive. I know it is hard to read negatives, but adding in a bunch of fluff would only have made the post longer.
Second. Try to get at least a 50% refund. That site is terrible (they dumped my shopping cart the first time I tried to get a shipping quote... that would have sent me away right there!) and they ripped you off. Feel free to use my post and PM me if you want my name and info to pass on to them.  The issue is that if the front end looks that bad, the back end is probably a complete mess.  Don't pay for a service in the US that is not PCI certified. (PCI = Payment Card Industry - a certification that their security is good enough to pass audit to handle payment cards).
Third: If you're buying through one vendor, then see if they offer a web hosting service for a reasonable price. IF NOT, then ask them what shopping carts they have plugins to support. If you get that, then all you'll do is add SKUs to your inventory and complete descriptions will show up on the site.  
Fourth: Look at Zen Cart if it is one of your options. I say this because I would approach them about being in their showcase (find out what's required in advance of doing any tech work) AND tell them you want a new category phrased as **"Bitcoin Merchants - merchants who accept bitcoin"** in their showcase. That will put you high in the list above books (here is their showcase page:  )
Finally, you're in a hard market. Most of the people I know are pretty picky about outdoor gear (hunters, farmers, kayakers, etc).  There was a time that REI was the only place to buy because of the quality.  If you're working with low quality or no-name stuff, you might be better served in trying to find a few good deals on name brand equipment and supplies. Maybe check out what is available through liquidators?  
And... one more thing... you might consider putting together a really nice 'camper package' intended for Satoshi Forrest that would include stuff that homeless people can use so that people can buy it on your site and you ship it to them. It needs to be a decent price, but include stuff homeless people can really use. Like stuff to clean up with, health supplements?, ... I don't know... talk to the guy running it and ask him what they would need on a routine basis. 
Maybe offer a good quality can opener (p38s might be too difficult to use, so something easy to use but durable. Not that crap that Walmart sells and calls a can opener) as an upgrade, since they don't need new ones on a routine basis.
Maybe offer a good deal on a nice tent (it's in FL, so doesn't have to be subzero.  or a sleeping bag that can crunch down really small (I have one that is about the size of a juice can once I've smashed it down into the sack).
Those would all be 'loss leader' type things in a way to build up credibility in your company and to get the name out. Since you're shipping directly to Satoshi Forrest, you can write off any loss as donations.
Good luck with your site. Feel free to PM me if you like.

I'm not seeing anyway for you to sign up for a vendor account, so this is really nothing like Amazon. It's a basic bitcoin based store.
The stuff I check on all seems to be marked up at least 15% over if I just bought them in dollars.
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:00:48


Wow... talk about crappy 'customer service' have you read their customer service page?  
That is the most confusing piece of ????? 
And they also are not like Amazon (no ability to sign up as a vendor). They're nothing more than an internet retail site.

If the files are stored of read only media, what exactly do you want to secure?  The files can't be altered from the internet facing side. Anyone on the inside with access to change the files would not be stopped by any form of encryption on external links. They provide the hash to verify the file.

Thinking about what they (the city) can go after them for, what about a wash room facility (like they have at campgrounds).  He probably needs to consider a fund for that. If they can hook into public water/sewer and provide a toilette and shower, that would probably take out one of the issues that they city can come after them for?

@_date: 2013-09-12 18:18:26
Right... they're both closer to Walmart than Amazon.  They both offer stuff for sale that was made elsewhere and by other people.  Basically drop shippers.
Amazon is "Amazon" because vendors can sign up to sell their own stuff there.

The point about the vendor accounts was that the site is nothing like Amazon. It is a basic bitcoin based retail site and there are already a lot of those out there, so it isn't exactly ground breaking.
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:03:11
Thank you for the answer. 
And thank you again for the tip. I'm still waiting on my bitcoin-qt to sync with the world, but I'll definitely claim it after that so I can have something to tip other people with. I actually want this to take off even more than it has.
