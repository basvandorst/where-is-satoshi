You find your GBP account with a normal bank transfer, so however long that takes. But then converting to BTC or USD or CNY or whatever is instant. 
I've only done BTC to GBP with them and the transfer to my bank happened in a couple of days, but by that point the pound value was locked in. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 19:31:11
But doesn't it mean that 25% more bitcoin is being released per day during this time, until the difficulty readjusts? Which would cause the supply to reduce when corrected?
And given the number of transactions able to be processed per block, is the network currently able to handle 25% more, because there are effectively 7 or 8 blocks per hour?

While I definitely agree that shapeshift shouldn't fall under the regulation, wouldn't a more accurate analogy be a foreign currency exchange, as the thing that you are 'vending' is another currency and the user will then go on to spend the product that you sell somewhere else.
I assume that the currency exchanges wouldn't come under the bitlicense but I assume they have another set of regulations to follow. No idea how this stuff works.

You know, I don't think a reddit alternative necessarily needs to be decentralised, it just needs to remove the over the top powers of admins and mods to remove whatever they want.
Each sub is a mini dictatorship with it's own secret police and there is absolutely no route for the common-person to influence policy or become part of the system.
What I would do is remove the mod thread/comment 'deletion' power and replace it with only a 'hide'. That would  make it fully transparent what is being determined 'inappropriate' but people would have the option to see the full conversation and threads if they wanted. And remove the mod authority and determine decisions by the community, for example a thread flagged for deletion goes into a public opinion tab, and 'active members' (say 1+ comment per week, for 3 months) get to vote whether it is sub-appropriate, before put into the permanent (but still viewable) deleted pile.
Also, there needs to be some kind of method for ownership change of subs, but it would be hard to get it right and not game-able. Something like a motion of &gt;50% of active sub members would be sufficient to remove a mod, and the same to initiate a new one. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:06:48
It's removed for all intents and purposes. What I mean is have a button that allows people to see what has been 'removed', kind of like how very downvoted stuff has is hidden by default. And for instance have a tab at the top next to 'comments' 'related' 'other discussion' called 'removed', which would allow people to see what's going on.

Being naturally close to the blocksize limit makes it cheaper for 'attackers' to fill the blocks.
While the blocksize is 1MB, if at 900kb it takes only 100kb to fill. If the blocksize was 2MB it would take 1100kb to fill. If the blocksize was 8MB it would take 7.9MB to fill.
Raising the boundaries would make an attack much more expensive than increasing fees on the small amount needed to fill up the current blocks..

I hope not, because this whole thing hasn't been just about a parameter change, but about the control a handful of people over the community, and how they are building a different product to what most people originally invested their time and money in (settlement layer vs magic Internet money)
I'd like too see the opportunity for new names and developers get into the field, and I think enabling multiple clients and groups to coexist is the way to do this. But if core caves to the 2MB pressure and people stick with them, there's no opening, just more towing the party line.

Sure, cash is technically a settlement system, but what I mean is that bitcoin is becoming a settlement system for large transactions only.

Agreed, just pointing out that a doubling of block size increases the cost to fill the block from 10% of fees to 110% of fees. Dynamics and the amount which fees are will obviously change, but 10% -&gt; 110% wont, until there are more 'legitimate transactions' filling the blocks.
As I say below:


@_date: 2016-11-24 16:55:58
Christ dude, can't someone have a different thought to you without being accused of trolling?
I replied to directly above, so if you want to have a bash at that too feel free: 
@_date: 2016-12-06 16:11:39
True, but the cost to spam-fill a block is currently, say, 10% of a current per-block's fees at 90% full. 
If the max size was to go to 2mb (for example), it would be 110% of the current per-block fees.
Much more expensive to 'spam', even with fees significantly reduced due to less competition.
@_date: 2016-11-24 17:00:40
It's really not... the block size limit was an anti-spam measure, not an economic decision. We can all argue about whether it's a good or bad thing, but it was never fundamental to the network until it became a policy tool.
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:41:27
Not how it was designed, there was unlimited transactions per second until the anti-spam filter was implemented. 
And even then there wasn't a problem until tps became so high that it couldn't handle spam clogging up the pipes.
@_date: 2016-11-15 14:55:22
Counterpoint: Fees of 10+ cents are excluding huge portions of the world right now.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:05:31
But it can either be 10,000 transactions of $0.01 or 1,000 transactions of $0.10. The Miners get paid the same either way, but more people can play with more throughput per block. And fees don't have to go up.
@_date: 2016-12-02 12:06:10

It should do, it works fine for me.
Check out the man page: 
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:55:01
The network is busy (maybe organic, maybe spam) and needs to be upgraded to handle more transactions. Maybe this could be by increasing the transactions per block. Maybe this could be by changing the code to reduce the amount of data that fills blocks (segwit). Maybe it could be by offloading transactions to sidechains (lightning or similar, when it gets produced).
Regardless, the core developers have stated that there must always be more transactions than space to create a fee market (aka artificial scarcity), which is part of their economic design for the network. This obviously pushes fees up because everyone is bidding for the fixed number of tickets on the bus.
Some other developers want to change the protocol in different ways to how the Core team do to allow more transactions per block and there are some people that are very angry about that, but I have no idea why is bringing that up now...
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:16:20
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:28:25
Segwit is one step to improving it, but what comes after that? Increasing capacity by upto 70% assuming every transaction is segwitted (which it won't be) will only be a small bump. 
Core won't commit to a blocksize hard fork, and if seems the only way to use bitcoin in the future will be to use a third party sidechain network, if/when it exists. 
I'm totally on board with segwit, but we can't seriously consider this as a serious solution for scaling more than a year ahead.

But if they were allowed to, miners could accept 10,000x $0.02 fees rather than 1,000 $0.2. Same payment, but more transactions getting processed.
But they're not allowed to, so the fees go up.
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:26:30

Justification: Loads of companies say they work in the UK but it's really not that true as they all basically require international SEPA transfers to fund your account (including coinbase). This takes a chunk out of your exchange rate, and takes several days. Circle has been hit-and-miss with accepting British cards (they officially say they don't, but some peoples have worked), but you also don't know what fees are going to be levied at what time by them or your bank.
Coinfloor seems to have created a 'trusted' localbitcoins alternative based on their exchange platform and, to me, it looks very appealing, working though national bank transfer and releasing your coins in minutes.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:40:20
You wouldn't do the processing on the VM, therefore cheaper and you've still got a local copy.

My composite buy in was $280 so I'm stoked! Although up until 2 months ago it was at ~$450 which I was not enjoying so much. 
It's good to see an upswing regardless how little as I think everyone was reaching downward price spiral fatigue and we needed some kind of indication that things would recover.

Coinbase is not really 'available' in the UK, you still need to send your money internationally to do deposits and it takes a chunk out of your buy.
No connection to UK banks whatsoever.

I find the water is so muddy around this. The dispute is between 'core' and 'classic' in terms of the underlying blockchain.
Blockstream are a company for developing sidechains which work on the blockchain. The company *shouldn't* have influence over the client being run by people or what the blocksize is or anything, just like Coinbase or the Winklevii or don't. Sure, they can give their opinion, but they do not *own* bitcoin development.
It's such a conflict of interests, and one company getting funded shouldn't influence the open source project development. I'm neither one way or the other in blocksize, but I think there needs to be more oversight on why things are being done.

If there is 451 BTC worth of fees there, won't allowing more transactions increase the profitability of the miners? 
If transactions get dropped after 72 hours, that's ~0.8BTC extra per block held up at the moment. Not much, but I'm sure they'd like to have it.

It doesnt affect the coins themselves, it affects how many transactions can be processed in each block (i.e. every 10 minutes). 
If the blocksize is too small and bitcoin gets more popular (therefore more transactions are happening) if you try to spend or send, you could end up waiting multiple blocks for your transaction to occur. Some people want to increase the blocksize so more transactions can occur at once, some people want to wait for people to make other software that would work off-chain to relieve the strain.
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:55:24
Some argue that by moving some stuff off of the blockchain means that it can be run with smaller block sizes, so that people in 3rd world countries and poor internet infrastructure can still run full nodes (hence avoiding centralisation). 
The major protocol that is talked about is the Lightning Network, although software doesn't actually exist for it yet. It's basis is that you'd set up a channel between two people (addresses) that would send back and forward, off-chain, until you're ready to settle up, on the main bitcoin blockchain. Some argue that this would require trusting a third party, and that the main blockchain could handle it anyway so is unnecessary. Also, it doesn't exist yet, so avoiding a blocksize increase because it will one day solve the problem is potentially flawed.
The bitcoin blockchain has a hard limit encoded into it of 1MB per block. Once more that 1MB worth of transactions per 10 minutes are being generated, the transactions will get backlogged or lost. Some people (including some core devs) are against increasing the size to allow for more transactions. Other core devs suggest that it should increase, but without consensus there has been a massive argument.
 everyone, look how impartial I'm being :-D

I'm not knowledgeable enough on the first part, but I know Mycelium now has a dynamic fee structure for "Economic", "Normal", and "High", which changes the fee based on the network environment, so it's definitely do-able.

As long as as Theymos or any other mods can decide what community members are allowed to think and say, it's not a forum any more, it's a soapbox which we have to listen to and agree with, or leave.
Stating outright that his opinion was correct and that everyone else should leave killed the community in a way that it can never recover from, while he (and his associates) have control. When 2/5ths of the bitcoin development team think something should be done a certain way, a guy who controls an online forum can't decide that they're wrong and dictate that everyone he controls must agree with him.
Regardless of my opinion on bitcoin, he has killed as a forum, possibly permanently.

It's just the dev kit that they released today. It's like saying virtual reality is pointless because the Occulus Rift is a proprietary high-cost system.
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:04:57
The first thing you've got to do when assessing the **utility** of this is to ignore the price. If they're sold at scale, improved and embedded into things they'll be massively cheaper, as this is just the dev kit.
Ok, so **if** you could get one for $10 for example, what would you do with it? What could be done with it?
For example, there is huge potential and hype for 3D printers at the moment based on their future utility, but they're still out of the price range for most people. Doesn't make them any less useful.

Circle, coinbase and similar only work in the US and recently some european countries. It's really hard to buy a small to medium amount of bitcoin in these places, but often they get paid in amazon vouchers (i.e. bloggers with affiliate payments) which they can convert to bitcoin and then local cash a lot easier than they can direct from amazon vouchers

If you want to develop software for the 21 computer you need to buy the 21 computer dev-kit.
