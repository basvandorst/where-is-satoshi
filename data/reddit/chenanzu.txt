A wallet is an encryption key that has nothing linking itself to an identity. You can create wallets through a computer terminal on a server located in Switzerland or a computer using a McDonalds Wifi. A wallet on a government ran exchange has identity links, but, by design, there is no requirement to use a government ran exchange. Transactions between anonymous wallets are a fundamental feature of crypto by intentional design.
If your 50 year old father makes an account on Coinbase and buys a bitcoin with his account linked to his drivers license and never takes his money off of the government ran exchange -- thats a little different than what I'm talking about.

Bitcoin is basically cold storage of untracked, volatile assets at present.
The average transaction volume, fee, and very limited number of transactions suggests nothing otherwise. Generally speaking, Bitcoin is not being used, invested, or spent on things. It is sitting in a wallet acquiring value as hype builds and people are duped into supporting an anarchist currency that is basically anti-civilizational.
A civilization where bitcoin is the dominant currency is one in which the poor are going to be absolutely and totally dominated with no mechanism for their government institutions to be effective in generating funds to do anything or motivate people. People would be smart to fear such a state of affairs, rather than being duped by billionaires who want to become feudal lords.

This is sort of a "change my view" post guys... no need to spam downvotes. If my understanding is wrong, help me out. Don't just try to bury my comment.

Did you not look at any historical data?
Every single year, in late November, it rockets upward. It crashes by January.
We've already seen the peak at around 20K. Its only going down. Get out while you can. Buy everyone else's crushed dreams in January.

You want to think critically?
Explain to me how a "currency" is supposed to function when no one dares to use it in exchange for goods and services.
Bitcoin is currently a thing that can be bought, with massive transaction fees and times. No one that I know of dares to exchange it for goods. The companies that previously took risks as first movers and exchanged goods for bitcoin are no longer willing to do so because of the volatility, transaction fees, transaction times, and faith that a crash is coming within the next 30 days.
Bitcoin was more useful in 2016 than it is today. Its use as a currency has gone backwards as you can no longer buy things with it and virtually everyone knows a crash is coming.
By the looks of it, the crash is starting now. 
Here is the data, just in:

I honestly trust myself and my own security only. I am a tech person with an interest in security. I can make my own  hardware wallets and solutions.
I don't trust hardware or hardware manufacturers. I only trust the opensource code and myself.
