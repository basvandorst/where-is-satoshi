@_date: 2018-11-21 04:22:37
Is the whole Blockchain as slow as Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:04:08
Yea of little faith....do not ever underestimate the short memory or vile greed of the herd.

I bought two potato cakes in 1979 for 4 cents.
We're talking inflation now.

Wen moon?
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:04:55
So Bitcoin is slower than other Blockchains? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:49:34
I apologize for the retarded comment, it's just annoying.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:32:15
That's a bit rich, you only think it's a bad financial decision based on today's value of what he gave for the pizza. You don't understand it maybe.
Do you order pizzas and see them as financial decisions?
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:15:36
So you are saying that Bitcoin is only as fast as the Blockchain.  
@_date: 2018-11-21 23:39:16
There never was a million dollar pizza.
Maybe a million dollar loaf of bread in 1930s Germany.
These posts are getting worse by the day.

I think that this sub had it, that dynamic quality that fuels all evolving ideas , communities, artists etc...
Alas, eventually that turns into static quality followed by a  lack of quality all altogether.
It is human nature, 
You can't put your finger on dynamic quality, but you can wrap both of your hands around static quality....
It's just very average.

Do tell? I'm all eyes and ears too.

I'm busy , sorry ...i never meant to hurt you, i thought it was a good idea at the time...i never realized people were only interested in making a quick or slow dollar.
Silly me

@_date: 2018-11-21 23:35:09
You mean  ...store your value....your fiat currency of choice in the hope that others do inflating its price.
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:05:59
That's ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:13:50
Its not so much that they want to kill bitcoin...as they want to kill the blockchain..
The establishment understand whats at stake here..if the blockchain gains favour amongst the good folk ..the powers that be become redundant..
The problem they have with the blockchain is that THEY DONT NEED AND CANT control it...
IT is the BLOCKCHAIN....which is the PEOPLE 
The banks wealthy govts are PETRIFIED they will no longer be able to control the HERD ..
Politics is the art of controlling ones environment 
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:35:40
The truth...we cant handle the truth 
@_date: 2018-03-11 22:32:04
No..millions of people can represent a view that is totally illogical ..Truth does not reside in safety in numbers

Good luck this time, its a different landscape...
With different players....there maybe better options come the next bull run....Bitcoin may not be one of them.

Unless you have been shorting Bitcoin pretty much all year,  then you too are not very good at making money on Bitcoin.
