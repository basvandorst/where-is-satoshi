So tell me why you think that people who are giving good advice by telling „HODL” are „annoying”.  I’m pretty sure that there is a lot of people who never invested their money becouse they care about - and holding is a good safe option for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:49

@_date: 2017-12-19 13:20:37
Even banks are not safe, there is no safe place. But people sometimes are taking a risk, why we should tell them „no dont do that”? And even if its not safe, what we are doing here?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:36
HODL TILL THE END
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:20:53
