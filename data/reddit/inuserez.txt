thanks alot!!! thats awesome
one last question : where is the information of the block located? how does the blocks stay in the internet without any server or a physical file?

okay, I understand the mempool now, but I'm sorry to ask another question.
my transaction sits in the mempool and then a miner mines a block with my transaction. but after my transaction is in one block, its not going to continue anywhere? my transaction will forever be in only one block?
and where is the memory of the block held in? who is hosting all the information of the blocks?

but how is it working? and is that possible for bitcoin to have a better technology in the future such as better tps? or different block size?

when im paying in bitcoin from my wallet to another wallet it doesnt have to pass through all the blocks? how many blocks does it have to pass

wow, I have just seen that the blockchain size is now 147gb while last year it was 90gb.
isnt it a problem that every single miner has to own the entire blockchain on their computers? in a couple years if bitcoin indeed grows the amout of space it will require would be astronomical

what if someone updates the bitcoin and only 40% of the community agrees to mine that new version? where will their bitcoins go? it will be separated into two new coins?
what happens if I own 10 bitcoins, and a fork happens and 50% of the people accept the new version while 50% stays with the old version. where does my currency go to?

alright, and I have one more question.
if I make a transaction, will it eventually pass all the blocks in the network and be recorded in each one of them?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:30:58
oh, so every miner can solve a different block?
then it means that if bitcoin will have more miners the transactions will be faster?
