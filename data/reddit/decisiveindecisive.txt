Great post, and thanks for adding to the community! I am finding myself in line with your point of view and am on the verge of trading myself.
* [This is fantastic blockchain explanation]( explanation for beginners if you'd like to add to your site. 
* Can you share some other reading material that influenced your decisions to begin trading and how to do it successfully?
* Furthermore, I wouldn't suggest Reddit as the only news source. I would *highly* recommend Medium.com for intelligent write ups on blockchain and bitcoin, Steemit (though I just signed up myself) and 99bitcoins.com (for beginners) among other news sources.
Just my two Satoshis, keep up the good work

It's refreshing to read a book without predictions, technical analysis, market caps, hard forks or the actual price of a Bitcoin mentioned at all. 
The powerful thing about Bitcoin is it's disruption, and that "currency" is simply the first application of many. That scaling is simply part of the process and that we are in the midst of the largest infrastructure inversion in recent history.

This thread seems like it'll attract some intelligent attention; I have a question.
I understand Blockchain technology (as well as the recent big changes like SegWit) fairly well now, but want to get a deeper knowledge. What reading material/website/skills can I focus on to better understand the protocol? 
My short term goal is to be able to better understand the complexities of Bitcoin, like what JJ mentioned at the Breaking Bitcoin talk, and many topics Jimmy Song touches on.
EDIT: I have Mastering Bitcoin, but am holding off for now as it is highly catered to the developer. Happy to make that the next step if it's the appropriate one

@_date: 2018-04-03 04:33:24
Interesting, I hadn't considered that the funding transaction specifically isn't exchanging for anything *per se*...
Can you explain how like-kind exemptions could affect LN transactions, I was under the impression like-kind involved only real estate, and further, involved selling an asset and re-buying within that same asset. Within the the channel, back and forth transactions seem to fit this, but funding and withdrawal?
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:00:29
I don't necessarily see your point in your thread about why miners might want to drop BIP91 (other than rational players wanting to avoid soft-forks) 
So the problem is that non-upgraded nodes/miners will waste their time mining non-signalling blocks? Wouldn't this fix itself after a short amount of time in similar fashion to BIP91 locking in at 80% followed by 100% signaling?

Most people didn't understand email in the early 90's. Wallets where you control the private keys will gain popularity along with widespread adoption. For *now* noobs can rely on exchanges but over time it will likely change.

I see Roger Ver and Jihans name thrown around a lot as villains of Bitcoin in this subreddit but they're revered in I'm just trying to get some facts as to 'why' they are treated as such in the respective communities and what each respective coin is promising.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:21:27
Yes but if is correct, that split will have SegWit activated and BCC supporters don't want a SegWit blockchain... Though I dont understand why.
@_date: 2017-07-27 16:33:02
That's true, but unfortunately it looks likely that BCC may not have nearly as much value after merely the first couple of days of availability. Granted, it seems that most users aren't aware of how to claim the BCC immediately so this might keep the price floating for a while until an easy guide comes along
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:52:26

Thanks for the info man, bear with me here, but what do you mean by sweeping and will loading the wallet.dat expose my seed in any way to the Bitcash ABC wallet?
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:02:41
Thank you! 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but SegWit will decrease transaction size, therefore increasing the amount of transaction in a block and thus increasing confirmation speed and decreasing fees, to an extent. 
Is Core expecting this to be good enough 'for now' while developers try to come up with a better solution than a hard fork? Why are they against a hard fork (other than to avoid a chainsplit at all costs)?
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:21:49
How the hell do they plan on scaling and avoiding the problems that Bitcoin 2 months ago had? What's the promise?
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:43:47
Though I don't doubt that some individuals would want to manipulate the market for a profit, but the entire subreddit seems like ardent supporters of BCC. 40k+ people is a lot, so naturally im inferring that there must be ~some~ value to BCC...
@_date: 2017-07-22 23:58:09


I disagree with this mainly because it wouldn't be a couple-days paid off, it could be a huge amount of money, is right in that sense.
Nonetheless I'm also not convinced of any manipulation, but I'm not ruling it out. The question is *WHY* would anyone move to BCC other than to make $$$ by entering early. What makes this coin better SegWit/SegWit2x??
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:14:10
Can you comment on what you mean by 'safer than any core release'?
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:20:23
Maybe I'm naive, but it seems unlikely that the support for BCC is an organized attack on Bitcoins users. What I'm confused about is what BCC is promising. 
I'm inclined to follow suit in selling my BCC in the early stages but want to understand the ideals of both before making any decisions
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:32:15
I definitely agree with the majority of your points and really appreciate you putting this together. 
Can you share with me some reddit/medium posts or cites where I can learn more about big blocks / scaling in general?
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:14:50
That's fair, I didn't mean to generalize all of it does seem like a majority of users there support BCC though
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:36:00
This is fantastic, thank you for making these points!
I have to do more research on how SegWit actually works and the repercussions of big blocks but this has given me a launch pad for my googling. Where do you stand on the matter and can you suggest a good source to use to stay informed moving forward?
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:55:30
I believe Bitcoin Cash is scheduled to fork before SegWit activates, and that would be coming up pretty soon, so that's what some may be referring to

Hey Stadicus, using your guide as we speak to get an LN Node up and running.

When I created the wallet I did not input a passphrase for the wallet, then I imported the mnemonic and I didn't input a cipher passphrase. I went back and created the wallet with a passphrase and the same mnemonic and lo and behold it worked!
I think I didn't import the wallet successfully this first time around. I appreciate the help

You are only opening yourself up to risk if you go any of the following:
a) You move your BTC to an exchange supporting BCC
b) You sell all your BTC for BCC in an attempt to get in on cheap prices
c) You export your seed and upload that seed (with the btc in the wallet) to another BCC wallet, which could potentially steal your coins if there is malicious code.

As I understand you can make a (for the moment) nominal amount of money on fees through transactions that are moved through a Lightning channel you own, but aside from that the incentives aren't great.
For me it's to learn more about how a node actually works and to experiment with both the test network and the main net through a full client. I'm also helping the Bitcoin network by making it that much more secure and  decentralized
