That is why you should use BadAss.Sx Electrum node. All logs are routed to /dev/null
I believe it is electrum.badass.sx as node address

Really? Is that really all you can do to dislike a TOOL which holds ALL benefits of all excisting alt coins so EVERYONE can benefit from it? Really? Calling people names? Shouting things they even do not excist? Really?
You sound really trustworthy with your connection of NXT. BTCD will be the coin of SuperNET of which you need to shout your shit over it. And you have other coins who have joined and are joining SuperNET, but because of your personal hate against NXT you can only name NXT in your spit against SuperNET. 
It is a shame a dude like you has the possibility to come on Reddit. Calling names, accuse people of stuff of which you do even have one single proof for it. Not a fucking single letter of what you typed is right. 
Shame yourself in a corner.

I ratter lose MY OWN HARD EARNED money to them then to something you ever create(d). You sound like a real bitter man with evil thoughts against others. So i see you more running with others money then the 137+ devs of SuperNET.

Again, you are saying things with no value. Do you know the 137+ devs of SuperNET? You are coming with a website link (which anyone can create on a high school exam) and tell me that those 8 people are way better then what the 137+ devs of SuperNET are creating, but you don't even know how everything is linked or what they are building. 
Sorry man, but you don't really sounds trustworthy to me. Something happened in the past of which you react so furious against SuperNET. I don't know what, but it would be better if we quit this conversation. I have put my money in SuperNET, simply because i got sick of all those p&amp;d schemes of alt coins. If we want to get alts on top then we should work together and try to create an environment which suits everyone, and that includes even you, instead of shouting and calling names.

That conference is in about 2 weeks in India...i think it will explode from there. Many C# devs there.

Most of the commenters are afraid of this guy haha. Nr.1: He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about.
LOL, if someone knows what he is talking about then it is him. One of the most dedicated developers out there and some Bitcoin expert (roflmao) tells us that he doesn't know what he is talking about. He has brought a full working btc blockchain back till 5GB while the original devs even don't know what they must do now with btc. Apparently they don't know what they are even doing, set aside what they are talking about lately.
He is going to kickass the BTC world with Iguana and it seems all of you already know that, but are afraid of what he is bringing in the future. Perhaps some helping hands would bring the btc world back together, but when the original devs are screwing btc till his death, they better hold their mouths. Incl. some Bitcoin experts (roflmao x2).

They are making a network with masternodes for it. Located everywhere in the world like others are doing

Did you even read what this is all about? Apparently not, because you wouldn't ask this :)
