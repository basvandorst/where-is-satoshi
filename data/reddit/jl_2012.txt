I don't know if your faucet allows you to delay the withdraw. It absolutely makes no sense to collect payment as low as 0.00013BTC, which is less than 0.1USD. Consider this way: what was the impact to you if the faucet ran away with your 0.1USD?

1. No, if they don't upgrade, they could do anything they are already doing
2. That's unrelated to segwit at all
3. No, Coinjoin may have larger or smaller UTXO impact than normal transactions
4. Yes and no. Yes, with the same absolute size, non-segwit tx will be more expensive. No, non-segwit tx won't pay *more* because of introduction of segwit (e.g. assuming the same tx volume, if you are paying $1 now, in a post-segwit world you will still pay $1 if you do not upgrade. If you upgrade, you may only pay $0.5)
5. Although it's very unlikely, if we later find that 75% reduction is too much, it could be reduced through a softfork.

Witness data *does* consume less resources:
1. witness data won't go to UTXO, the most expensive data as you may want to keep it in RAM
2. witness data may be omitted when sending to SPV wallets, saving a lot of bandwidth
3. witness data long time ago may be removed from full nodes' harddrive, while keeping the full tx history. Currently it's not possible: you either keep the full blockchain for full history, or keep the UTXO only (and losing the full history)

That's the same in the bitcoin world. You can't change the payer, payee, and the value without invalidating the transaction.
However, there are also many ways to alter a real world cheque without invalidating it, e.g. spilling coffee on the cheque, write something with invisible ink.
In bitcoin world, this is called transaction malleability. One can pad some garbage to the signature while the transaction is still valid.

"the hash would need to be recalculated for each input" yes
"we are back to O(n2 )" no. It's O(n) because the total size is irrelevant
"it should be done once for all inputs." This is O(1), not O(n). There is some technical difficulty so it is not done this way. However, since the signature verification is much slower than hashing, this is negligible.

2. I tell you that the last character of the "random_string" is either 0 or 1
3. You make a guess and place a bet. I will double your Bitcoin if you are right.
4. I will reveal "random_string"
5. You verify that the SHA256 matches the value I gave you in the first step.
This proves that the "random_string" has been generated before you place the bet, and has never been modified.

The timestamp is needed because of, and only because of, difficulty retarget. Without the 2 hours in future restriction, miners may lower the difficulty by using future timestamps maliciously. In such case the retarget becomes completely pointless. (miners may maliciously increase the difficulty by using a timestamp in the past, as long as the the past-median-time rule is followed. But this will reduce the revenue of miners and is not economical)
However I don't think this destroys your theory. Two hours is more than enough for any reasonable disagreement. The software will also remind you if your clock is  different from all your peers by more than 5 minutes.

@_date: 2016-12-08 17:07:17
I share some of your concerns. Therefore, a more complete proposal will probably be a "softfork-reversal-hardfork", as described in the hardfork warning system (BIP-HWS)  (all read the replies by u/luke-jr )
So the idea is there will be a first be softfork to disable a version bit in block header (nVersion&amp;0x40000000). Full and SPV nodes supporting BIP-HWS must at the same time build a hardfork warning system that'd monitor any header-like data with adequate PoW. When this warning system is widely deployed, and when we want to have a HF, we will do something like forcenet, but with the 0x40000000 bit set. So the outcome is:
1. For nodes with the proper BIP-HWS support, they will see this as a hardfork. However, the warning system will tell users there are suspicious mining activities
2. For nodes without BIP-HWS support, they will see it as a soft-hardfork, a continuously empty chain
So strictly speaking, forcenet is a hardfork, not soft-hardfork proposal. I think this finds a better balance between "forcing everyone to follow" and "leaving legacy nodes completely vulnerable".

As warned in BIP143, DON'T do this. Uncompressed key in segwit are disabled by policy in 0.13.1, and we may eventually get rid of it by a softfork. If your "1" address is encoding a uncompressed key (which you won't know unless you have the public key), money sent to the "3" address generated this way will be unspendable

A more likely scenario is all major exchanges and payment processors will support the new version. (BTCChina and Huobi have announced that they will support the block size increase) As deadcoin could not be sold in any traditional channels, miners on the dead chain won't be able to pay their electricity bill and are forced to join the new chain. The block interval in the dead chain becomes extremely long, and mempool of dead nodes are stuck with huge amount of double-spending attempts. Your double-spending attempts will not be confirmed until next retarget. With only 5% of mining power sticking to the dead chain, it will take 40 weeks for the next difficulty decrease. Value of deadcoin dropped to zero long before that.

so he read the spec before everyone ? (obviously)
Why it has to be a secret spec? Actually it's even 80% similar to my proposal in January:

not same, because the txids won't change after a reorg (unless a malleability attack)

The video or statment were made when Bitcoin was 1% or even 0.1% of the current price. It was true in that moment but I'm sure it didn't mention "forever"

If you were not aware of that, BIP16 (P2SH) was implemented in the same way 4 years ago: 
@_date: 2016-09-01 15:04:26
yes, they could, since that's protected by hash-locked contract.
Again, both parties have to look at the blockchain once per week. For this purpose you need reliable Internet access.
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:53:09
No, they only need to monitor from time to time, say once per week.
This is the magic of Lightning Network: you could have the security level of a fully confirmed transaction without broadcasting the transaction at all. The only extra thing you need to do is to look at the blockchain from time to time
@_date: 2016-09-02 10:49:16
It is capped to just above 1 year. And you don't really want that long. If your counterparty disappeared, you have to wait for 1 year to get your money back
@_date: 2016-09-01 18:50:42
There is a time delay, defined by OP_CSV, before the dishonest party could steal the money. If the delay was set as 10 days, then checking once per week might be good enough. In the worst case the honest party has 3 days to react and take all money
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:00:56
Let me make it more specific: you need a full node to make sure the channel-opening tx has got enough confirmations. Also, you need a full node to monitor the blockchain from time-to-time, say once every few days, to make sure your counterparties are not cheating. LN only saves your transaction costs, not validation costs.
You could, of course, out-source the duty of monitoring the chain. But that's certainly less secure than running your own full node.
@_date: 2016-09-01 12:06:47
Despite of some people thinking this is a stupid question, my answer is yes, with limitations.
If the 2 people have a direct channel opened, they could transact with each other for unlimited times, without going through the Internet at all.
However, they still need to monitor the blockchain from time to time, to make sure the counterparty is not cheating by broadcasting an expired tx. Or they have to outsource this job.
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:57:42
Or just export the keys and import to another wallet. Since you are asking this question, I suppose you don't know how to do it. So the easiest way is to use qt. You should transfer all your BTC to a new wallet (could be Ledger in your case), not back to a different address in your wallet.dat
(As a side note, the best practice is still to run a bitcoin-qt to monitor your Bitcoin. It doesn't mean you have to use bitcoin-qt as your wallet. You may store your bitcoin in Ledger, and use bitcoin-qt to monitor the addresses for you)
After you import the wallet.dat to a BCH wallet, you may assume the .dat file is compromised and don't use any address from it to accept any BTC or BCH again.
@_date: 2017-10-09 08:09:41
First make sure you computer is free of malware, then use bitcoin-qt to send your bitcoin to a safe address (like Ledger). This makes sure your BTC are safe.
Then you may find a BCH wallet to transfer your BCH to your Ledger. I'm not going to recommend any BCH software, though.

Don't self assign BIP number. Please follow: 
@_date: 2016-10-10 16:54:56
With hardfork, everything is anyone-can-spend (because you could always hardfork again), while everything is anyone-cannot-spend (because if you don't upgrade you won't see the hardfork).
The term "anyone-can-spend" makes sense only in one single set of rules. A hardfork is another chain with a new rule set.
@_date: 2016-10-29 16:41:35
~~It is a possible solution. However, many hardfork solutions including BIP101, 109, and BU are sold as "no SPV wallet upgrade needed", so they won't agree with you. (Some also attack segwit as it requires "voluntary upgraded". They obviously prefer dictatorship)~~
I misread your proposal. Yes, it could be done that way.
@_date: 2016-10-24 16:34:24
so you have to explicitly do something to make your non-segwit wallet to watch those segwit addresses. It won't happen by default
@_date: 2016-10-11 11:43:11
you don't get my point. Hardfork is a new set of rules, which is invisible to users unless they take the action to upgrade. So anything anyone-can-pay before could become no-one-can-pay, while something no-one-can-pay before could become anyone-can-pay. You can't have "half upgrade" to a hardfork so you either completely follow the new rules, or completely not.
If a hardfork redefines something anyone-can-pay before to be no-one-can-pay, and you still try to treat it as anyone-can-pay, you are just making a hardfork of hardfork
@_date: 2016-10-25 10:49:34
one may argue P2SH-segwit addresses are "segwit address"
@_date: 2016-10-24 15:43:33
this is not true. A non-segwit wallet shouldn't show anything sending to a segwit address. For non-segwit wallet, segwit addresses are addresses belonging to other people
@_date: 2015-11-29 18:24:27
I'm talking about confiscation, not tracing

Only 1/20 of the world population is ruled by the US Constitution
Bitcoin, paper money, and gold are all unconfisticatable if stored properly. Bitcoin is the easiest the hide: it could be stored without  a physical form (e.g. brainwallet)
@_date: 2015-11-09 09:32:28
CLTV allows you to make a transaction so that it's valid only if included AFTER block X, not the other way.
Although it is technically possible to have a new rule to archive what you say, that will violate the basic assumption that a valid tx will always be valid (if no double spending)

At least you know 1. there is a leak; 2.  is the source of the leak. By fixing  you may find the cause is the bad VPS server image. If you couldn't find the cause, you will get hacked again from another server and you will eventually discover the cause.


How do you know this hasn't been done?

It's not just "better bitcoin casino". It means you could play against any people, anonymously, remotely, completely trustless, no third-party, provably fair, impossible to cheat.

I think about 25 blocks in 2013. The verion 0.8.0 triggered an unknown bug at that time and caused a hardfork: 
Another one with 6 blocks in 2015. Just after the activation of BIP66, 2 mining pools did not validate blocks properly and built on the wrong side:

Yes, some miners set the versionbit manually

There were 2 major forks in the past 4 years. At least one theft happened in the 2013 fork.

CSV allows locking of about 1 year at maximum. For longer you need CLTV. Anyway, locking fund for too long is not recommended

Why did you move your coins to a new address? I guess it's for security reason as you have disclosed the public key of the old address? But now you disclosed the public key of the new address again by publishing the message.
