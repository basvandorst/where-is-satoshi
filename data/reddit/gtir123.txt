It is still unclear to me, as the citation made in that response in used innapropriately, it refers to the question of can businesses refuse cash in favor of checks or credit. NOT, can they refuse cash in favor of sea shells or ladybugs. 
I would love to hear from a lawyer on this question as it will inveitebly be addressed as bitcoin adoption becomes mainstream and the government reacts to people opting out of USD.

Generally, businesses and other organisations registered for GST will: include GST in the price of sales to their customers. claim credits for the GST included in the price of their business purchases.

You don't need Internet to receive or own bitcoin, the way it works is the person who owns the private key controls the bitcoin in that account.

Creation aka Supply has a lot to do with price aka inflation deflation
The four basic laws of supply and demand are
If demand increases (demand curve shifts to the right) and supply remains unchanged, a shortage occurs, leading to a higher equilibrium price.
If demand decreases (demand curve shifts to the left) and supply remains unchanged, a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.
If demand remains unchanged and supply increases (supply curve shifts to the right), a surplus occurs, leading to a lower equilibrium price.

The answer is in the USA you cannot even be "legal" if you tried. 
Best case you will be "grey" we are on the frontier these old bureaucrats dont even have a clue.
In the USA you can register as an MSB with fincen, thats the first step. Next interpret each state law and decide which states require state licenses.
Here are the insanely burdensome state licensing requirements 
Notice most states want "bonding"... good luck getting a bonded for your risky speculative magic internet money cash sales business...
Best approach, register with fincen, send a letter to each state explaining your business and asking what they want you to do, if anything.
You probably wont even get a response... but once youve made that good faith effort, I doubt you will get any criminal penalties if anyone wants to target you.

With bitstamp or Okcoin the same person can buy and sell 1 coin 10 times in a day, creating volume charts that arent helpfull.

doesnt GST mean sales tax? Yes sometimes when I buy soda from a vending machine, the machine does not itemize the sales tax separately from the purcahse, but i am still paying it! This is even harder to fathom on something with such slim margins and low fees as FOREX? Clearly, buying bitcoin in Australia, will cost 10% more, that is unavoidable with a 10% tax on sales?! Are you suggesting that they pay 10% sales out of the profits they make on a .2% trading fee? Those number dont ad up.

It can be hard to interpret  the volume from an exchange as you have daytraders, margin trading etc messing with the data...

So I want to have a psuedo cold storage but I also need access to my coins everyday... I was thinking of using a electrum wallet offline and using the cold storage feature in mycelium on a designated cellphone to send coins out of cold storage.
This would require reusing the same address everyday since electrum wouldnt be able to generate the new addresses since its offline.
Also is it secure to use mycelium like this?

The speed of legacy banking systems is irrelevant. As that is equally slow for all exchanges. What is more likely the cause is fees, I think bitfinex has a lower fee for trading BTC. Also for instance BTCE is always a bit cheaper because of the 1% international wire fee that they charge.

State by state licensing requirements for an internet business - massive burden. 
Fees and minimum holdings requirements - discriminatory to small business and anti competitive
Licenses for crypto to crypto transations - will just push companies that do this out of your state or country, this is an online business, nothing to do with your state! You cant restrict citizens access to websites because you dont like it.
Verification of account holders - Again pushes business away, no reason for me to use an account that requires verification when I can use math to generate an account for myself.
License to sell my own personal property? Really? This is very different than selling in exchange for a promise to remit funds at a later date
This type of over regulation is the exact reason why our country is having problems! The free market can decide who gets what, not government bureaucrats...
Am I wrong here?

Irrelevant, both those involved alleged knowledge of intent to commit a crime. I would not deal with an admitted criminal.

It doesn't matter, they are clearly RETAIL something, and my post was pointing out that the ever increasing RETAIL volume is a good sign, "exchange" volume can be indicators of trading and not make it easy to gauge adoption

the glory of posting publicly is part of the appeal, a public link with a private password could solve the integration problems they have with setting up on various platforms

They dont mention sales tax on bitcoin sales?
@_date: 2014-10-15 15:42:55
I highly doubt that exemption includes " issuers of virtual currency" which is what all the "satoshi would be a criminal" posts were based on
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:25:50
excellent :)

actually our text logs prove that it was a mistake and he acknowledges that, a police report however would be fruitless, except maybe if he was scared of police involvement

Localbitcoins sellers are selling through and intermediary website, no different in theory than selling on coinbase or bitstamp. This is excluded from MSB and AML because the intermediary website is responsible for KYC. Localbitcoins.com is responsible for identifying customers, the seller is not. Just like Coinbase is responsible for identifying customers, the seller is not.

if you insist.... 
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:50:58
Yes collecting data and enthusiastically enforcing overzealous interpretations of the law... doing blockchain analysis on peoples transaction to see what they are doing with there coins, banning gamblers and localbitcoins sellers etc etc
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:27:53
whats important here isnt the $ amount, its the trend, also as I pointed out in my post localbitcoins isnt "day trading activity", these are end users paying a high markup for convenience 
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:56:43
Yes as a drug dealer its a very usefull important part of my business plan to turn my  untraceable anonymous paper dollars into volatile, easily traceable, illiquid new asset class of digital tokens. Uhhh wait...

The blockchain will not be lost. We have a facility with several hundred printers, printing the blockchain around the clock. They are all being stored in enviromentally controlled facilities ready to be scanned back to the network... dont worry, we didnt add any transaction ;)

Why bother with bitadress and Linux and all that nonsense, just turn of your internet, generate a mycelium HD seed, write it down and delete... Or if your paranoid do this on an old phone and reset it before and after etc

Any chance you can send me a trezor MPK so i can check out the format?

im pretty sure there is more bitcoin created daily than USD... thats pretty inflationary if you ask me!....
@_date: 2014-11-12 22:20:19
your totally right I can buy more stuff with one bitcoins than I could a year ago.... i dont know what I was thinking... your logic is much superior
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:53:49
Better start printing then.

So this is not exactly accurate?

anyone you deal with on LBC should have 100% feedback, it is VERY difficuly to go below 100% on LBC, you have to have multiple bad feedback to get below 100%, this is because of there confirmed unconfirmed system

Yes there is a long string on the back of the card...  I guess thats the one... Can I sign up for like 50 of these from mbank?

How do you know those swaps are short?

shes real! in my head shes real!
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:37:24
;) Add in all the other transactions made in bitcoin, bitpay/merchants, day traders, hodlers, growth in darknet markets since silk road, percentage of dormant coins vs dormancy periods etc and we have a pretty good minimum base price.
It would be cool if someone smarter than me can continue this calculation with other know transaction data
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:17:25
Yeah, very nice,  but why isn't it listed in the linksi just posted

Yes the effect of that section is for a business to charge "average joe" 10% extra? How does this not effect average investor or  consumer?! anything that affects business affects customer...

Currently the project is not ready for launch but as soon as it is I will be recruiting everyone on reddit to help :) Right now I am still working on backers and devs to get it up and running. I should be doing a soft launch within a month and going live if their are no huge problems.

You can offer services to the non msb states after just a fincen registration though, right? 
Also why limit use of this technology from the oppressed people in Iran, North Korea etc...? 
These are the people bitcoin was meant to free! 
Fuck the "man", fuck the status quo, you are a pioneer, act like one, do the right thing in spite of the perceived negative consequences. As long as you have the moral upper hand and enough people are on your side, you will see those consequences dissolve and you will BECOME the righteous changes that we all desperately need. 
Just saying, thats what I would do :)

Infastrucure is readily available! Have you heard of cellphones? Internet Cafes? Banks? Western union? currency dealers are on every street corner.. 
.... why is this hard to understand... do you think these people are living isolated in huts in a desert?! 
for instance... Your husband who has immigrated to the US sends you bitcoin to your paper wallet, you go into town and sell it to some guy, or maybe go to the place you used to pick up your western union cash and sell it to that guy... 
 do you understand what a paper wallet is

Do I have to take it out to re encode it?

This needs to be an option at coinbase and circle if they want to see mass adoption
@_date: 2014-07-24 21:02:50
As usual they cant get a bank account in the USA, what a shame.
Is there a fee to send money to coinsetter, or just to withdraw it?
Do I have full bitstamp trading volume to use for my limit orders?
Can I sign up for a business account?
Coinsetter have you tried credit unions?
