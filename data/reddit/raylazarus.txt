@_date: 2017-12-30 05:21:29
No context, nothing

Then how come the real satoshi doesn't come out and say "that's not me"? Is he a bitch or something?

He probably panic sold at the bottom and seeing it skyrocket afterwards was too much for hm
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:50:27

Yeah why lose 2% a year when you can lose 75% in 30 days
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:42:51

@_date: 2018-02-26 00:46:26
Yeah, why lose 40% buying power in 16 years when you can lose 50% in 2 months
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:27:44
He opens a short as soon as he starts dumping so he cashes out + gets even more btc
Literally free money
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:10:44
Why would you dox yourself like this? You're posting a picture of your house + stating you got btc. This is very dangerous dude.
