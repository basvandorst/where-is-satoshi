lol I can't help myself from giggling at the innocent and adorable naivety of OP. 
You keep on being you, The world needs more people like you.

That price just skyrocketed almost 50% and then corrected all the way back down in the span of 60 min. That's some extraordinary circumstances or very clear evidence of coordination. 
This is very interesting and I'll probably cease business with Coinbase once other conformations of KYC come through. 
Either way - this is fascinating from the sidelines. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:20:02
Sure isn't but this smells like RICO territory once regulations get put into place.
Should be an interesting year! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:36:37


Perhaps you should be the first to leave, then. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:02:11
But where should we go? Coinbase is so stupidly convenient. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:59:23
I'm not even sure how the exchange would work, though. 
Like, what would be the facets of such a project?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:20:48
It was actually 4 minutes due to the utter incompetence of CoinBase 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:40:50
You actually buy into these claims? How else do you think people are going to make money when bitcoin tapers off? The top 1%'ers will sell off because everyone's holding, price is too high so no one can reliably buy in at any meaning point, progress stagnates and... *viola*, you've reached your market cap. Congratulations. 
And, come on, lol... you can only buy GFX cards and radio shack shit with BTC reliably. And, by that point, the financial giants will have gotten their hands in the game and likely will have a rival product while simultaneously lobbying the US gov't to regulate the commodity into the dirt because it's stupidly easy to paint a target on BTC's back as it's entre community is anti-establishment. 
It's going to be super interesting watching this trend, though. Seen it countless times, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:26:37
Just something to consider when the whales start cashing out 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:39:39
For whatever reason you purged your account.
That being said, bubbles don't necessarily need any sort of a compromised leverage position to be considered a "true" bubble. That's just silly, lol. 
BTC is inherently flawed in that it has scalability issues hence why you're seeing hard forks. It's nearing the point where it's economically infeasible to mine and thus progress slows simply by the design of the commodity. 
Block-chain will persevere once it's accepted and implemented by the financial institutions. 
Facebook is almost certainly an outlier as the other major tech platforms that have emerged are all struggling (very hard) - Twitch, YT, SnapChat, etc,. are all operating on losses. The one takeaway that any emerging tech can garner from FB is that FB knew how to scale its business. 
Crypto is the new .com bubble. And, just like that bubble - a thousand will emerge and only a few will survive. The few that did remain are the ones that understood how to properly scale their business. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:27:19
This reminds me of the 4chan greentext about penny stocks, lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:28:00
Block-chain technology has intrinsic value and a properly scalable commodity would benefit fantastically from its application. BTC, as you've said, has artificial value because people believe it has intrinsic value.  But, BTC has quite a few long-term issues that I believe a lot of people are choosing to ignore in hopes of riding the wave. 
I'm good for at least 1.0000 BTC but I lived through the .com bubble, and the Japanese housing bubble, and the American housing bubble. So, I know what crazed-buying and pricing looks like. Whether BTC can pivot to meet its impending problems head on or become a relic remains to be seen.
The decent thing about real estate, though, is that it has a limited supply and people always need somewhere to live.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:19:21
I agree. Blockchain ain't going anywhere. The anti-establishment archetype just never works out in the end. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:16:58
Certainly! But, that is, of course, *until* the financial institutions adopt blockchain tech, pump out their own currency, lobby the gov't to either: (a) regulate BTC into the ground or (b) outlaw it entirely. My money's on (a) as you can easily sway the public with a few stores of linking BTC to narcotics and child pedo rings. And, by then, the financial sector will have enough whales vested that outlawing won't actually be to their advantage. 
I'm buying in because it never hurts to put a quarter in the slot machine on the way out. But, man, are you naive if you actually think the financial institutions won't try to compete, lol.  
And, this isn't even touching on the inherent issues present within BTC's design, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:08:35


This is an excellent example of survivorship bias :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:23:24
Exactly, lol.
Or, banking corps will just pump out their own currency that's backed by the Fed. And *that* actually will be the burst. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:50:02
Sure, a lot are sold now.
Maybe it will continue that way until it doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:37:48
Certainly. Assuming someone's willing to pay for it. 
Just need to keep that in the back of your mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:08
No, there's actually no financial instrument to short the currency. You have to work through indirects. The blind leading the blind around here, lol. 
Do you even understand what you're talking about or do you just conflate a bunch of different ideas together to make it seem like you're speaking intelligently? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:49:21
The real wisdom here is that financial advice is never blanket advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:42:50
That's a graph of commodities and not currency. It's almost completely irrelevant to the discussion as simple legislation swiftly destroys the entire crypto-community or (worse) regulates it into oblivion. I can understand almost all of the other arguments for crypto but I believe the anti-establishment will be the final nail in the coffin of BTC, BCH or whatever else LTE-coin is the flavor of the month.
I believe there are a few different scenarios of how BTC plays out - either large-scale financial institutions adopt the model and utilize it for transactions going forward (to-the-moon meme), BTC will simply be traded on the exchanges similar to stocks/bonds/securities (current day expectations), legislation is passed in an attempt to curtail illicit activity surrounding the coins association ($0.01 price), or an alternative public-minded and highly-scalable coin will be introduced and BTC will become a digital relic.
Blockchain is here to stay, obviously as the proof-of-concept has been provided given the success of BTC. Whether it will remain is completely up in the air.
I'm probably good for at least 1.000000 BTC, though. Drop in the bucket as I'm young with a lot of time left to earn. Plus, it's really interesting stuff. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:10:07
Uh oh... looks like the market's correcting :(
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:22
You can't short it, you retard lol 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:49:56
Can't tell if you're talking about bitcoin or real-estate... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:50:22
Just saying. Hold and do homework. Don't hold and forget.
To me, the writings on the wall. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:48:46
Asking the real questions 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:26:58
Until there isn't someone willing to pay for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:03:49
*as yet to be tested, results may vary
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:22:02
I actually believe the entire movement is propped upon "the greater fool theory". This is a very interesting economic movement. But, as they say, if you don't learn from your past you're doomed to repeat it. 
I'll definitely be staying tuned in to watch what happens, though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:11:41
Have you had a chance to read through any of the comments around here? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:29:03
Oh, no. That's not what I'm saying at all. Did you read my post, by chance?
Do you understand the technology behind BTC? Because, that's where the real money is. You see how there are a lot of BTC clones right now? And, I'm sure you realize how incestous the financial industry is with the US government. So, you simply scale the tech at a financial firm, lobby the gov't, (*poof* BTC), hello blockchain product! Well, maybe not *poof* because of vested whales but... well, you get the idea. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:44:19
No market for *Bitcoin*. There will be a pervasive market for blockchain clones and the tech that it spawns.
We're saying the exact same thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:34:12
This is *assuming* there's a seller willing to sell at that price point. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:21:27
Whatever you say, bud. I guess every generation is due for a good pump n dump. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:56:03
A battery discharges and the available watts falls off so too does the overall power of the electric machine. In other words, it doesn't discharge at a consistent rate like combustibles do. 
This is, like, basic physics, man. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:37:35
Never said the market would go away. Looks like blockchain is here to stay.
