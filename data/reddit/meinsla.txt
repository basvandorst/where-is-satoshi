It definitely used to be. However these days due to the very low cost of electricity and labor in China, it is very ideal for Chinese to mine themselves. Of course, only the mining pool owners know for sure, but we can logically deduce that most of the hashing power is in-house.
@_date: 2015-12-19 06:25:12
No matter how you pay for goods you can expect to eventually get screwed. However, using bitcoin offers no recourse for the consumer. Most methods of paying a merchant offer some consumer protections but if you intentionally circumvent them you really have no room to complain. Best to treat your bitcoin like a penny stock along with everyone else.
@_date: 2015-12-08 14:33:29


Sure there is, just look at what it costs to mine. It's simply not profitable most places on the planet to mine bitcoin due to electricity costs. China is one of the few exceptions.
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:52:09
Are we going to pretend that most of the chinese mining pools hashing power aren't from in-house mining farms?

Sure it is. Your particular situation occurred with gyft. But it's happened many times in the past with other merchants when paying with bitcoin. Doesn't matter who you're paying, bitcoin is still an irreversible transaction that favors the merchant and not the consumer. Purchase your goods with a credit card next time if this bothers you.
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:04:13
You're missing *my* point. I am saying that this will happen from time to time using any service that accepts bitcoin. It's just a reality. Move on. Gyft isn't the first to have this issue and it won't be the last.

So wait it's just a display bug? Like the balance merely showed negative but nothing was transferred? Because this is definitely counter to what pxallin1122 said in his post the other day. He stated that during the time the balance showed negative, he was able to make withdrawls from coinbase, and that the "lock-out" only occurred once he brought the issue to coinbase's attention. Assuming he's not blatantly lying or mistaken, that's separate thing entirely.
If pxallin1122 addresses anything, it needs to be this specific point.

This cannot come first. Bitcoin was meant to be mined on a CPU, conceivably putting the currency in the hands of the general populace, but because that's not feasible anymore people must rely merely on proselytizing, a much harder sell. Nevermind the most bitcoiners treat the "currency" like a penny stock rather than money. Hard for a currency to become successful if it's holders are unwilling to relinquish it, everyone's still waiting on their payday.

Even using bitcoin to buy straight from overstock or microsoft is no different. It's immediately converted to USD after transaction, at a cost, passing the extra cost to the consumer eventually. And because bitcoin's value fluctuates too much, you'd have to do away with USD all together before these companies do otherwise.
Sending bitcoin to bitcoin is completely useless because at some point down the line it has to get converted to real money, at a cost. Well I shouldn't say completely useless, it's great for concealing the source of money (money laundering, drugs, etc.)

That's because that's what most people use money for, buying things and paying bills. So we're left with:
* savings accounts
* buying a house
* sending funds to people abroad
* settling debts
Considering regular money is already digital at this point, I can do all of these just fine without Bitcoin. Most people don't need to send money abroad and can do so with other services when the need arises. And people certainly don't want to settle a debt with a currency that might be worth less the next day. And regarding the 'savings account' point, I can't even guarantee that Bitcoin will be still be used or exchanged for value in say 10 years.
And this isn't even taking in account that the bitcoin will have to be converted and deconverted (at a cost) to usable local currency before being able to do things with like buying groceries and paying bills.


Many lost the same in a matter of days or weeks with Bitcoin. Using rare anecdotal situations doesn't mean anything. USD by comparison is pretty solid.


That's what the average person sees it as. The average bitcoin user however sees it as a way to get rich and uses it as a risky speculation tool.


I have a few issues with this article because the writer doesn't use the standard definition of 'safe asset' (which are assets protected from litigation), but doesn't really do a fantastic job defining what he means by safe asset as used in the article. He says


That's a pretty loose definition. That by itself says nothing as to whether or not it has the potential to lose value or not. It's entirely possible due to bitcoin's volatility it would be worth less when you need the to pull it out the most.
@_date: 2016-03-29 13:22:34

No, it isn't. Why would forgoing consumer protections like chargebacks be a benefit to me as a consumer?
And inflation-free honestly sounds horrible because it incentivizes saving over spending. However, assuming it's a benefit, it's completely nullified by its volatility because there are much stronger market variables acting upon it.

You answered your own question. This is the struggle the merchant accepting bitcoin has to struggle with if he wants zero-conf. In the example above, we do know who made the transaction. However for most merchants it a decision they're going to have to weigh.
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:36:52
It's not a problem that needs addressing. Fast food places aren't verifying every 1 and 5 dollar bill aren't counterfeit because the time and costs of doing so would hurt the business. For small, low risk transactions, coinbase allows this to occur because waiting for confirmations is a poor user experience and overall it's a better system. That being said defrauding a fast food place with a counterfeit $5 bill is illegal, and so is defrauding coinbase with doublespends.
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:28:47
He could have easily absolved any ill intent by restoring the amount ($10) immediately following the event. He has since stated that coinbase would need to ask for the money before he will return it. The intent could now be easily construed as him attempting leverage his position against coinbase to further whatever objective he has. In the very least it makes his intent a lot less clear.

Lol, I think you have that backwards. Buttcoin is a satire sub. I and many others browse it at work during downtimes because it's funny.
Bitcoiners on the other hand are extremely financially invested in the currency, and extremely emotionally invested in the ideology that comes with it. It's obvious now that it's not just a currency at this point, it's very much a fringe social movement, and by some definitions a religion. Every bitcoiner can't stop talking  about it and how it's going to change the world. So you can see it's funny when you claim it's the buttcoiners that are the zealots.

That's not what he's saying. You are missing the point. They have no confidence in bitcoin as a currency, and that is likely **WHY**. You can argue all day whether or not they are justified in thinking that, but he never even touched on that point so it's so strange to even bring it up.

I guess that sounds great for the merchant, but most people are not business owners, they are customers. Why should the customer care? The customer has a cheap payment system that works, that virtually everyone accepts and is already familiar with. Why would he want to give up consumer protections like chargebacks just to save the merchant a few bucks?


The problem with your example is that's a necessary cost regardless. Meaning, whether or not you accept bitcoin you will still need that machine because you will lose the money from people that that want to pay by card, which is used by everywhere on the planet. People are not going to immediately research bitcoin when their money is no longer good there, they will simply go elsewhere, people just want stuff to work.

He was referring to the "reporting to authorities" part, not the thread itself.
@_date: 2015-03-25 04:06:17
That's a poor comparison because bitcoin ATMs are not incredibly common, so it is conceivably noteworthy for someone to rate their experience, good *or* bad. And also, as we all know, bitcoin enthusiasts love to brag about using bitcoin for things that'd otherwise be trivial with fiat, "OMG I payed my rent in bitcoin!!!" etc, etc.

The screen with the ES offer, at first glance, looks like any other TOS, and the preface doesn't concisely explain what it actually is. It's misleading, especially considering [it's unfeasible to read every TOS]( we encounter.
It boils down to this: software is bundled together in hope that a certain amount of people will just skip reading the TOS and hit next so they start using the program. I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone that actually enjoys or uses the ask.com toolbar, yet many people have it installed. However, there is a big difference between a useless toolbar and something that has the potential to degrade performance and perhaps even your electricity bill.
Regardless of the intentions, these are dangerous waters to be treading, that's for sure.

No, not even close. I even quoted the guy and you still somehow missed it. He said they don't use it and simply are uninterested in bitcoin and then he listed the reasons why. The statement he made is either true or false, it's that simple.

Therein lies the main issue. Not everyone can or even wants to be their own bank. We have the technology now where that's not necessary. I can be a consumer of product without knowing the intricacies of how it works. I don't need to know how to be a farmer, or code software, or build engines, to be a consumer of these things. "Being your own bank" may give you some peace of mind but it's something most people are unwilling to do because it adds unnecessary complexity for little benefit.
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:58:35
Well the onus is on you to answer that question in this case because it's a non-issue for everyone else. Opening my bank account was free, it has never costed me money to store my money there, not to mention I get a interest return on both my checking and savings accounts each month.

Why do bitcoiners get so offended when people simply decide to not use their currency?

Women already have use of money. We're talking about bitcoin, a specific type or subset of money (or not even money at all by some definitions). In my own opinion money needs to at least hold value, have buying power, and be simple to use. Bitcoin does none of those things.
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:14:01
I bet you couldn't answer that question yourself.

It could be any digital payment method, not just bitcoin. Corporate money doesn't enter the equation here.

There's at least some gender disparity in most fields. My sister works in the childcare industry and it's mostly women. Not necessarily a cause for concern though.

Not questionable at all, just look at the price of bitcoin fluctuate in a given month. It has no store of value. You could lose 20% of your money just by holding it in bitcoin. There was a post on this subreddit a few weeks ago where a guy who gets paid in bitcoin, got paid then the price immediately dropped. Resulting in him being able to buy a whole lot less with it. An unfortunate reality when it comes to bitcoin.

No, like other merchants Newegg does not store money in bitcoin due to its volatility. It's immediately converted to USD through a third party at a cost. And I don't know where you pulled the 5-10% figure from.

You're right, the non-bitcoiners have the agenda. The one's with literally no stake in the "currency." That's makes sense.

Major credit card companies like Visa/Mastercard charge around 1.5-3% on purchases depending on the price. And fraud is absorbed by the card issuer, not the merchant. Since merchants like Coinbase charge 1%, it's not too far off. Sure you're paying a bit extra for some consumer protections but I'd rather the consumer have those rights rather than them being at the will of the merchant.
