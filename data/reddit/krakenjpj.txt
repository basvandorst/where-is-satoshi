Hi, Kraken support here. Thanks for using Kraken.  We've recently had a major upgrade and conditions are substantially improving, and we continue to work to improve the platform for issues that remain and that are reported.
We can't recommend specific banks but one place where you may wish to look is in r/bitcoinuk where there are periodically seen certain discussions of fidor, fire, revolut and other manner of "getting crypto out" to fiat.  If it's prohibitive where you live to have a bank account set up for that, you may wish to explore getting an account set up in a bank located in a SEPA zone country.

We don't have any specific withdrawal problems - usually where there are complaints associated with withdrawals, it has been due to either someone having an on-hold withdrawal, or due to questions about CAD or USD that can be resolved by initiating a support inquiry.

Kraken support here.  You probably have already been informed by your ticket, but posting here again for reddit readers to review. We are currently processing a large number of incoming deposits. Due to a backlog in processing, deposits may take slightly longer than usual to appear in your account once they have been successfully received.
If the 'Funding' page indicates the deposit has been successfully received but you don't see those funds reflected in your Ledger or your account balance, please wait 12 - 24 hours. If the deposit has not been added to your Ledger after 24 hours, please reply back by creating a ticket at support.kraken.com and let us know.
In the instance where there is a hold on some deposit, this is different as it would require some staff action, in which case please ensure you have an open ticket created through support.kraken.com and communicate with staff about how to clear the hold.
Thank you for your patience and understanding.
Additionally, (to OP) please modify or remove your post(s) in which you posted personally identifiable information (PII), or sensitive personal information (SPI), including balance information and / or other account related information. Posting this via social media can lead to compromise of your account.  The only information necessary (and safe) to post on social media regarding your Kraken issue is your ticket number and, if you wish, a brief statement that you need our response on the issue (without account related information).

Hold up, it sounds like there was a natural disaster or something.  But I assure you actually there was not, it was downtime for an upgrade, which is (probably) what you heard about:
We were down for the upgrade for a while -- longer than we thought we'd be, but in the end, sufficient time to ensure everything would be in working order:
We've fixed people's issues -- but if for some reason your issue has _not_ been fixed, please, report the matter to us. 
The best way to do so is to create a ticket -- you can do so directly here:

Kraken support here.  This is a common issue right now and to remedy it, you will need to add a new withdrawal address or if you have a different wallet, add a different address from the other wallet.  The key to overcoming it seems to be basically that you need to add a new address.

Kraken support here.  Was reading with interest your post and wondering how I might solve your issue until I got to this part:
_support team keeps saying the same thing over and over, (...) "Hi, Thank you for providing that information. Unfortunately, The correspondent bank **SMBC NY** has requested more information on your transaction for their KYC processes before they allow your transaction through."_
If SMBC NY held your transaction (and that's what it looks like here) then there is nothing Kraken can do until that transaction is released.  There is no question that this is one of the most awful aspects of touching the banking system -- when someone in it decides to hold your deposit for an unexplained reason. 
In cases where your deposit is on hold with Kraken (and the deposit details have arrived at Kraken) we can tell clients in nearly every single case what the reason is for the hold and what action needs to be taken to clear it.  This is because it is with Kraken.  But if the item (deposit or withdrawal) is sitting at a bank (for example... SMBC NY) somewhere, and are stuck for reasons internal to that bank, that is out of Kraken's hands.  Staff can (and do) periodically put in inquiries to SMBC NY (for example) to ask about the status of such items, but we cannot control that which has not landed in our system.
If you have repeatedly encountered problems with SMBC NY, relating to your SWIFT (SMBC) transactions for reasons that are not explained, you may wish to try alternatives, such as relying more on crypto transactions or EUR account usage.  OTOH, if you have had nothing but success with your SWIFT transactions and nearly have never had an issue with SMBC NY, then this may simply not be an issue for you, reader.
As an aside, for those who have not seen this yet, please see, regarding our recent upgrade (deposit and withdrawal questions you may have are likely addressed in the below blog post):

Hello, Kraken support here. Kraken is allowing USD withdraw for those in the USA. There has been a certain amount of FUD to cut through post-upgrade.
1) If you are in the USA, need to activate USD funding on Kraken, and haven't done that yet, here's a support article on that: 
2) Be aware of limits pertaining to the above activity for USA residents (not imposed by Kraken, fwiw):  
The above limits relating to USD apply to USA residents only and it doesn't matter if you have Tier 4 custom limits that are higher - you are still constrained by the above limits if you live in the USA.
Which is why some people choose to rely more on a combination of cryptos and EUR account usage, since those have less restrictions generally speaking.
3) If you are not in the USA and are asking about withdrawals of USD, see: 
4) If none of the above helped you (that is, if you have some withdrawal problem that's not addressed by any of the above support articles), please escalate your issue here: 
Note:  These USD withdrawals will take up to five to 10 days to process after a specialist has identified the issue and taken action. 
Thanks for trading at Kraken!

1) Yes. We just got our verification issue fixed, also, which a lot of people have been asking about.  Verification will no longer be a bottleneck.

It kind of sounds like you don't want people in New York to have the internet, VPNs, or the ability to search for things beyond their borders.  Of course they have such things, like everybody all over the world does.  Or as Clouseau might say in reflection upon the circumstance of New York, "they are surrounded by a web of deduction, forensic science and the latest in technology such as two-way radios and e-mail."  Yet somehow we manage to avoid serving New York. (We'd be happy to go back to serving New York when things change for the better there, it's hard to say when that might happen..)
It is understandable that you want to know more about how this is done, but it's a security sensitive matter so the details of procedurally how we handle the NY issue are not disclosed. As mentioned in the prior comment,

Regarding your tickets (382097, 373430, 359817), I've looked into those -- the first one was solved last year (deposit released), the second one was a ticket that dealt with the same issue as the first (and so was merged into the first one), and the third was the same situation as the second (in effect, these were all one ticket, (edit: initiated last year, solved around the middle of this year)).

The fix for that is on the way as part of developers' efforts, but that shouldn't impede a return.  I do see your ticket number from the thread so I'll look into this further and get back to you.

We are not sure of how you communicated to 'Anjit,' please clarify.  Did you do so through a ticket, phone (we do not have phone support), or some other means?

A word of caution regarding phone numbers / phone support (Kraken doesn't have phone support, and actually clients of other major crypto firms such as Coinbase and others, too, as well as Kraken, have been targeted by "phone support" scammers who post false support numbers online).  See:

Kraken support here,
1) The tickets, 1043072 &amp; 942469, have had review by senior staff and have been addressed. It wouldn't be proper to say one has been getting "run around from Kraken with no resolution."
2) Please reconsider posting material on social media that reveals a substantial amount of detail either about your Kraken account details or holdings / deposit amounts. It's up to you, but you may wish to modify your posts (or consider limiting the type of information you post regarding your Kraken accounts) for your own security. This is alluded to in the 6th paragraph of our most recent blog post:
*"If you are looking for phone support, be aware that Kraken does NOT offer phone support at this time. There have been several reports of phishing attempts through fraudulent Kraken support phone numbers advertised on the Internet. Kraken will never ask you for your password, and we will never ask you to install any software. Remember that if you are publicly advertising your involvement with cryptocurrencies, you are making yourself a target. "*
In general, it's best just to present your ticket number and something minimal about the issue (e.g. "I have this ticket ( and it's involving a delayed deposit on Kraken, I haven't gotten a reply back in (X) days to my last comment on the ticket.") - ideally without mentioning further details (amounts, username(s), etc), for your security. This sort of post will help us, and you, tremendously. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:39:58
I can ask that this be done, but it will also help if you reiterate your request for a refund in the ticket if you would like that to occur at this time.

Kraken support here.  For those (OP and commenter(s)) who have had issues here, please note we do have staff who work on Glidera issues.  For any ticket you'd like to escalate, please use this form / process:  
@_date: 2018-09-21 06:13:55
Whether a client moves, temporarily mobilizes, or utilizes their account only in one place, the details of their activity are apparent to staff - immediately.  If they move they will either advise us of their move ahead of time (which then alerts staff of the need for change in an account details, such as address, etc.) or if they don't, staff will know right away anyway.  If there is an account where a client might attempt to utilize the account in New York after registering in a totally different state which they've previously (legitimately) verified in, the account won't be able to be operated, and will go back to kind of a holding state where it's unverified and won't work until the client moves out of NY and (by proof of residence and other means staff have whereby this is measured) then the client would need to reverify in a state we actually serve.
The TL;DR version of this is that the client would not be able to operate the account in NY, that our staff are diligent on this and every other matter of concern to clients, and that Kraken takes it very seriously.  It may be that you would want further details of how this all goes on, but for security reasons we don't disclose that.  With that said, New York doesn't have a giant gate around it keeping people out, and we can't imagine that NY would not want people traveling to NY and spending money there.  If you are eating lettuce in NY at a fine dinner, that lettuce probably came from as far away as California, for example.

@_date: 2018-09-20 17:15:33
Yeah, nope.  We don't serve New York.  Can confirm, Kraken support here.
Can also say that we actually take the whole verification and vetting of accounts seriously (probably much more so than other platforms) to ensure it doesn't happen. (Edit:  "what this means" without getting too much into detail, is if you live in NY, you will not be able to complete verification with us, you can "pre-verify" in hopes that things change at a future date, but if your residence is NY, it's not going to fly - the actual account setup won't happen)

Hi, Kraken support here.  Kraken hasn't lost your funds.  I took a look at this ticket to see what was going on.  As indicated, there are two wires, and staff has been looking into both of them.  One of them had an error associated with it which was identified and is being remedied.  The other one is a pending deposit.  As staff indicated, the typical turnaround time on (the CAD wire) is 5-12 business days, and you'll receive a deposit notification once it arrives in your account.

Hello, 
TL;DR:  Different systems handle this different ways.  
Somewhat longer version:  Some wallets are set up to have it so that only you are in control over your keys.  Other wallets are not set up that way.  (For example, this link  has information about various wallets and how each one handles your keys, so you can peruse various wallets to find out which one(s) suit you.)  Generally, on exchanges, you are not the custodian of privkeys for what you store on an exchange.    Various people thus put a certain amount in HW wallet / cold storage and have a smaller amount in software wallet / exchanges.  What is more likely to be subject to compromise, mobile or your laptop?  It depends on how well you protect yourself.  (Though many mobile applications do seem to have quite a few vulnerabilities these days.)  
But... "what you do, is up to you"
Kraken's security model is here: 
Please use 2FA! If you are going to have access to... fair sums of resources, protect yourself by activating 2FA.
A point about e-mails and privacy:

 ohai, 
x-chain atomic swaps, HTLCs etc., are still a ways out on the bitcoin blockchain... not what you could call easy to set up but there is work afoot to do stuff of that nature.  Check out what they are doing at  as an example.  It is not right now integrated into the bitcoin repo at  although wait a year (or maybe less, who knows) and you might see some pretty interesting stuff from that become part of bitcoin down the road.  (There is [a pull request in bitcoin for BIP199 / HTLCs]( but all that seems to be a ways off from implementation - but who knows, maybe it will happen sooner than I think it will.)
The future is bright and it will be very cool to see what Kraken does with this.  We don't know yet but check out some past explorations into this subject like Liquid protocol / sidechain as just an indicator of things to come in this space.

Hi.  We're pretty blown away by what was charged on this too.  However, a few points:
1) The title of this post starts with "Kraken's intermediary bank..." Intermediary banks utilized by the legacy banking system are not Kraken (they are not possessed / owned / controlled by Kraken in any way).
2) You stated "the unknown intermediary charged $123.69 on its own."  The intermediary was unknown to you (and critically, the fees of what would happen in this situation were not known or disclosed to you), but this is why we ask clients to confirm with their bank the best possible pathway in advance to avoid this kind of situation.
We have some documentation in our support area that alludes to this, apart from what we tell clients:
From the above support article,
"While Kraken doesn't charge fees for CAD deposits, banks may charge additional fees which are out of our control."
That is why it is especially important to communicate with your bank about what will happen when a transaction is constructed before it is initiated.
A final point is the fraud and chargeback risk associated with the card purchase of bitcoin, which is well documented.
Please do not hesitate to raise a support question prior to your next deposit to have us help you with any guidance you might need, at support.kraken.com and if you already have a ticket number you can escalate it here:
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:29:41

Hi, I wish to assure you that Kraken does not manipulate the prices.  But we do work with you to evaluate trades where you experienced a problem and work to determine if indeed a problem occurred or if it was just something that happened "as normal" based on observations of the ledger, positions, and trades -- in certain cases there we want to determine if there are for example a trading engine issue at the time of your trade that caused an issue with what you are doing.  
Here the best way forward to ensure proper analysis of what may have happened is to identify the numbers of any trades or orders in question, and make them part of a support ticket (log in at support.kraken.com) and designate the matter as specific to Trading.  It will either be evaluated by our Gen. Support group or Trading group, if there is a more detailed reply or analysis needed, the Trading group will look at it.

We recommend that clients check to ensure their account has the "screws tight" so to speak.  Our own security measures are summarized in part here (though we do not disclose all the things we do to keep clients secure):
However, there are some things that only clients can do in order to keep their accounts secure, such as add two factor authentication.  A guide on this is described here:

You are quite correct that Kraken didn't have to offer to retrieve them.
Please see the blog posts at blog.kraken.com which go further into detail on the subject.  The posts are dated July 27, August 1, and August 7, 2017.
Quoting from those posts:
(July 27, 2017)
"Kraken makes no promises/guarantees/warranties on the outcome of the fork. We will make our best effort to handle things in a way that benefits the most clients, but clients should manage their own wallets/coins if they want perfect control. Kraken will not be held responsible for any circumstances that result in the loss of BCH."
(August 1, 2017)
"Warning: only send BCH deposits to BCH deposit addresses when they become available (do NOT send any BCH to XBT deposit addresses)
(...) Do not send any BCH deposits until we make BCH-specific deposit addresses available. We will not honor BCH deposits sent to XBT-specific deposit addresses."
(August 7, 2017)
"Remember that Kraken has asset-specific deposit addresses and any funds sent to an address that isn’t specific to the asset will not be credited. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) deposits should only go to BCH-specific deposit addresses, and regular Bitcoin (XBT) deposits should only go to XBT-specific addresses. Any BCH sent to a XBT deposit address will not be credited and any XBT sent to a BCH deposit address will not be credited."
With any questions, please read the blog posts at blog.kraken.com.  Your support staff are going the extra mile, but there is certainly no guarantee at all, and as you correctly said, Kraken didn't have to offer to retrieve them. Furthermore, there is no guarantee of recovery.  Please work with support staff who have made this effort.

Thank you for getting in touch with us and letting us know about this. We are aware of issues that are resulting in difficulties for some users who are trying to get verified and are seeing a 'feature unavailable' or 'feature disabled' error message.
Our developers have been notified of this, and are working to troubleshoot and fix it as soon as possible.
Sorry for any inconvenience caused by this, and thank you for your patience and understanding while we are working to resolve these issues.
Please note that this issue is temporary, and does not affect all users - it appears to affect some users, and not all of the time.
One solution that may work for you is simply to try Verification once again while this issue is being fixed.
If this above suggestion does not work for you, and if you created your account for the first time on Kraken in November, you may wish to create a new account, which has solved the problem for some new clients who have encountered this issue.  (Please use a different e-mail address if making another account.)
You can have more than one account, but you cannot use them to circumvent any limits, nor can they be used for any fee tier sharing.

Hi - Kraken support here.  Thanks for your points here.  Not arguing semantics, but here are mentioned recent security review(s) - (posted in early September) from an organization which does its own independent review of exchanges:  
As Kraken has never been hacked, we remain rather unique in the industry and continue to lead with respect to security, and it's not a stretch to say we outshine other exchanges in that regard.
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:31:39
Well, Kraken support here - I'd recommend Kraken.  But, you should probably evaluate both the fee structures of the exchanges you will be using, and very importantly, their security.
You can do this independently of course, using sources that I do not provide.  At this link however are a few sources I have provided if you would like to review them:

Because we track progress on client's issues (regardless of what the issue is) through a ticket system, and because sometimes it takes a shorter time (such as in the case of releasing a held deposit) or a longer time (such as in the case of proposing changes that would have to do with UI / funding limits / how they appear and / or how or whether they affect certain clients a certain way, which would in fact alter the site experience for everyone) to resolve client issues, we track these issues through tickets.
Due to the interest in the exchange (and due to the interest in the space in general) it is not uncommon to receive tens of thousands of new tickets per day on a variety of issues here at Kraken. 
I hope you will share with me your ticket number (as generated from support.kraken.com).  If you do, I would be pleased to prioritize it for you.  You are the second person over the course of a day to report this or a similar concern (that I am personally aware of), but in both cases, the lack of a ticket number has limited what we can realistically do.

Yes, and our verification issues have been fixed, so if you had delays (whether short or long) in verification, you should try again.  For the U.S.A., the only U.S. states we do not currently serve are Washington State and New York State.  For those we do allow pre-verification.  For countries in Central and South America, there should be no issue.  Wherever you are, there will be a verification process after signup, but as it has been fixed this is no longer an impediment.

That's a fair question.  The answer is that there are laws but, as support staff, our primary role is to assist people with various issues as they arise and engage people as proactively as possible when we see things happening that might need a fix or just a nudge in the right direction.  We aren't legal specialists / lawyers (in the support teams), so we can't comment on the law / regulation / whatever regulatory-oriented matters are connected to it.  I'm not sure if this answer was adequate, but if it wasn't you are certainly free to use the escalation link in the previous comment to escalate your support ticket in which you may present further questions on the matter, and we'll do our best to route your questions in the support ticket to the proper place.

To address OP's post, OP stated in part that "We know for a fact that they could give us a private key for the specific BCH deposit account which can then be easily placed in the Breadwallet to retrieve the bitcoin."   Please note that is not correct.
Furthermore, a summary of Kraken's security (though not a complete source of information about how client information is secured and protected, as Kraken goes well beyond what we can disclose) is here:
As you stated, you "mistakenly transferred o,5 XBT from (your) Breadwallet to (your) friend’s Kraken BCH Deposit account."  
Please note also that clients were advised of Kraken's position on BCH before and after the fork:
1)  "Kraken will not be held responsible for any circumstances that result in the loss of BCH."  (July 27, 2017)
2)  "Warning: only send BCH deposits to BCH deposit addresses when they become available (do NOT send any BCH to XBT deposit addresses)" August 1, 2017
3)  "Make sure you only deposit BCH to BCH-specific deposit addresses
Remember that Kraken has asset-specific deposit addresses and any funds sent to an address that isn’t specific to the asset will not be credited. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) deposits should only go to BCH-specific deposit addresses, and regular Bitcoin (XBT) deposits should only go to XBT-specific addresses. Any BCH sent to a XBT deposit address will not be credited and any XBT sent to a BCH deposit address will not be credited."  - August 7, 2017
Please note also, that when a client is logged into Kraken, you have to check a box stating that you’ve reviewed the address and we’re not liable for your mistake.  When you send something from a wallet off the exchange to a Kraken address (e.g. if you are using any off-exchange wallet), Kraken can't offer prompts or reminders as you are the one controlling _all aspects_ of what you are doing (and it's not Kraken, it's some other wallet entirely).
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:14:53
I would like to comment on this from here at Kraken support to indicate that online reviews are unlikely to provide an accurate depiction of Kraken's performance.  It is possible that at least some, if not many of online reviews (on various review sites) are the product of people who either had a deposit issue that was not resolved as fast as they would have liked (in many cases due to problems with banks themselves or due to, in some cases, someone not following deposit instructions), or where people have had trading experiences that were not ideal due to past performance issues associated with the older trading engine.
Since the upgrade in January, things have been running very smoothly. If you haven’t tried in a while, give us another shot, and check out the new trading interface at: trade.kraken.com

Kraken support here.
This is not an answer regarding taxes, and you probably should not seek answers to your tax questions on reddit (it would be better to go to your own CPA you have retained, tax advisor or attorney, and/or use such software as such (CPA, advisor, or attorney) might suggest you use).  Kraken cannot provide answers to tax questions.
However, Kraken can do the following:
1) Assist you via a support ticket -- see  to create your ticket and obtain a ticket number.
2) Escalate your ticket -- see 
3) By way of your ticket, assist you with your Tier, limits, and / or type of account, which in turn will assist you with either removing more or depositing more (or both).
See, for further information, the following:
a) (To all readers!) If you are in the USA, need to activate USD funding on Kraken, and haven't done that yet, here's a support article on that: 
b) Be aware of limits pertaining to the above activity for USA residents (not imposed by Kraken, fwiw): 
The above limits relating to USD apply to USA residents only and it doesn't matter if you have Tier 4 custom limits that are higher - you are still constrained by the above limits if you live in the USA.
Which is why some people choose to rely more on a combination of cryptos and EUR account usage, since those have less restrictions generally speaking.
c) If you are not in the USA and are asking about withdrawals of USD, see: 
d) If none of the above helped you (that is, if you have some withdrawal problem that's not addressed by any of the above support articles), please escalate your issue here: 
Note: These USD withdrawals will take up to five to 10 days to process after a specialist has identified the issue and taken action.

We have been working on this issue (the limits issue, how these are presented, and how they affect different clients), but we would very much like to see your ticket number so we can get a better idea of the specific issue that you are encountering and tie it into the improvements we are working on, and track the progress on this.

Kraken doesn't limit US-based accounts to 100k per year.   There are regulatory issues for US residents that do create such limits for them, but there are also (depending on what people do) pathways to address this and meaningfully resolve any limits. 
See past discussion on this (in which your concerns about it were answered in a reddit post two months ago) [here](

Actually, no, I'm not a bot.  
On your question of if it is possible, the simplest answer is that accounts that have already been verified by our payment partner are operating normally.  So yes, it is possible to deposit USD to Kraken if you are a resident of / in the USA.  If you experience any issues, though, please don't hesitate to contact us by creating a new ticket, at:

It would have to be Kraken, for the following reasons:
1) Kraken has historically been lowest in cost (lowest cost, highest on Complete Cost Index line, which basically means the best cost-wise) for exchanges that support SEPA deposits and withdrawals.
2) Kraken has the best security.
We have not been hacked.  
Look up "biggest bitcoin hacks" -- you may find our competitors on the list, but you won't find us there.
3) Our recent upgrades:

Hello ~
Unfortunately Kraken does not offer service to Washington state at the current time. Kraken strives to offer the benefit of our services equally to residents of all US states. But the cost of maintaining our regulatory compliance strategy in some states can get very high, forcing us to make a hard choice about whether the cost is justified by the volume of business in the state. 
You can submit the verification details for any of our verification tiers and your account will be pre-verified to that tier so that it's ready to go if the situation changes in the future.
If you wish to do so, please go to:
 
Apologies for the inconvenience.

When did you have this verification issue?  If it was late last year, it is possible you were one of many that had this issue at Kraken.  We currently have a vastly improved verification experience and hope you will consider trying us again.

Per Kraken's blog post on the subject,
"[Provided that unforeseen circumstances do not make it prohibitively unsafe or difficult for us to do so, Kraken will support Bitcoin Cash as follows](
All Kraken clients holding Bitcoin (XBT) balances at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)"
Note that it states "at the time of the fork."  Please note that BTC (what we refer to as XBT on Kraken) and BCC (what is referred to as BCH on Kraken) are no longer connected the moment the fork happens.
   Once the fork happens, the chains are split, and BCH is considered a different currency. On Kraken, following the fork, you would be able to sell some of your XBT, all of your XBT, some of your BCH, or all of your BCH.  After the fork, if you were to sell all your XBT, it would have no effect on BCH, as they will be two separate chains at that point.  
Please research different wallets to determine which ones best suit your personal needs.

With it being July 30th, that's a tough nut to crack, but you could try this:
1) Open an account at Kraken if you haven't already.
2) When you have your account open, be sure to get verified.  (Our staff has been amped up various levels recently including verification team, so it's hard to say what may happen before Aug 1st but we encourage you to try.)
3) You can create a support ticket regarding any verification issue at support.kraken.com mentioning that your ticket or concern is specific to verification.  You can then also escalate the ticket at

Yes - "[Provided that unforeseen circumstances do not make it prohibitively unsafe or difficult for us to do so, Kraken will support Bitcoin Cash as follows](
All Kraken clients holding Bitcoin (XBT) balances at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)"
   Once the fork happens, the chains are split, and BCH is considered a different currency. On Kraken, following the fork, you would be able to sell some of your XBT, all of your XBT, some of your BCH, or all of your BCH.  After the fork, if you were to sell all your XBT, it would have no effect on BCH, as they will be two separate chains at that point.  
Of course, whether you sell them or keep them is entirely up to you.
