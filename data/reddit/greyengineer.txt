But this would only work for cases where money is interchanged between the two parties relatively equally up to the cap of the channel right?
Example: if you opened a payment channel to your landlord, the payments are all flowing in their direction, so the channel would have to be the size of your yearly rent (or twice that if the landlord doesn't want any money to be "allocated" to you). And then when you reach that, you have to close the channel because you can't commit more coin to the existing channel. So it can't grow and shrink as you need it to.

Buy using gdax. It’s the exchange behind coinbase. Use the same account login as your coinbase and buy btc there. You don’t have to pay the fee there at all. Someone has written a guide and made some videos on how to do it. Just google it. :)

Well, maybe they are canceling out how big this china dip could have been. I mean we are already seeing growth and recovery, maybe it's all the new joins?

Well, people would be buying into BTC at the increased prices, so the exchanges would be gaining more fiat as the BTC price increases.
