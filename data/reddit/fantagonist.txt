Yes, but you can transfer funds to it only through a bank transfer, which you aren't allowed to do since yesterday in Greece.

Of course you are right, buying using traceable fiat is the problem,  not bitcoin. Problem is, most people don't have many options. 
And what do you mean you buy anonymously using Coinbase? That's what I use, but with the EU equivalent of wire transfer. 
I guess in big cities getting bitcoin anonymously is way easier, with bitcoin ATMs and all that. That's not available in my town tho:(
@_date: 2015-08-29 05:57:18
... which is the case 90% of the time because you buy bitcoin with a wire transfer or a credit card.
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:34:52
Exactly. Put like 10% or less of your savings in bitcoin, and keep it there.

They would have to make it illegal first, which would have  some backslash, depending on how popular it becames. I am sure a lot of countries will end up doing it, for the time being it just isn't in their radar. Bitcoin's market cap is still really low compared to fiat. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:50:04
I am actually suprised there hasn't been more manipulation. With such a low market cap, any billionere can crash the market at his laisure. Not to mention what would happen if Satoshi decided to sell his 1M of bitcoins...
@_date: 2015-07-12 14:54:01
More like, we need them the same way a junkie needs his drug. It would kill him to take it away in an instant, but reducing then ceasing  use is the best long term solution.

Here in Greece, the pens are tied to the table/counter using the filthiest/ roughest rope they could find, wound haphazardly around the pen and secured with fucking duct tape. I wish I was fucking joking. Like, secure the pen if you want, but use a fucking chain or something!

Greek here. You cannot withdraw cash, and you cannot do transfers to accounts outside the country. That means, 99% of bitcoin aquitance methods are off the table. What you can do is transer between greek accounts, which means you can buy off localbitcoins.com, but there are not many sellers in greece and only 1-2 of them offer in-country bank transfer payment.
You can buy bitcoins with cash, but I don't really see the point off that to prevent  the haircut, since if you have the money in cash you can just keep them stashed away.

Can't you route it through tor? Also, if it is decentralized isn't it entirely possible to run a fork of the network on darknet?
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:21:53
Well, other online markets have been based solely on  user feedback and ratings without mod intervention and have been very successful, with better customer service than ebay.

You will see what you search for. If you search for CP, you'll get CP. OpenBazaar is a tool, it's not your nanny.

What is the difference between the black market and free market. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 20:02:08
Yeah, I agree with that point. Sure the price would crash but it would bounche back up in a week or so.
@_date: 2015-07-21 19:45:11
The darknet markets. If you stick to the top sellers, there is pretty much 0% chance of getting scammed, with really good customer service too. It's basically the only way a decentralized market can function.

As a Greek, yeah, we said FU to the EU, but it is more like the FU the little child says to his parents when he doesn't want to do his homework. We said no and this will help bitcoin, but this will be the least of my problems when there is no food on my table. Honestly, a yes would buy me some more years to get out of this shithole for good.
@_date: 2015-07-11 14:18:02
I live in Greece, but not in Athens. With the recent capital controls it's been very difficult for me to buy bitcoins, since even localbitcoins doesn't have any easy solutions now with the blocking of bank transefrs outside Greece.
I just wanted to say good job guys, and that I'll definately check the ATM out next time I'm in Athens.

Gpg is an open source software suite implementing the pgp protocols.
@_date: 2015-04-14 08:04:06
What. Why should a company that deals with large sums not rely on open source software? It's a fact that OSS is much easier to audit for security flaws, and what's more, the users can perform audits too, therefore not having to trust in the company's ability to keep their data safe. It's a win-win situation, especially since the company doesn't have to develop software from the ground up, and can instead rely on the industry standard software, which has been hardened by years of use.

I wonder if it would be viable to deploy robots in the real world with artificial learning and adapting procedures and giving them a some bitcoin each. Then they try to earn bitcoin in whichever way they wish.
So, the ones that don't succeed won't be able to pay for electricity eventually and will shut down and be presumably sent for reprogramming. The best ones will survive. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:56:27
It was optional, and most vendors didn't support it. It should be mandatory Imo.People could figure out pgp, multisig isn't that technical. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 23:36:10
Also, you could just pay for high priority. Free service would still be an option. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:45:40
It's true that it could become an easier proccess. One would think it would be integrated in some of the major bitcoin clients by now. However, I'd like to draw a parrallel between the multisig proccess and and the proccess of public-key encryption of communications ( pgp ) between user and vendor. It really wasn't used a lot in the past, because it was deemed too techical. However, when the LE started busting people, suddenly everyone was willing to learn. I just hope that the same thing happens with multisig. Problems like Evolution's exit scam are the risks you take without having centralized power which can enforce stuff. But technology offers solutions. I think we must prove the ones in power that an economy can function without them, in a trustless configuration.
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:40:45
I think 2 of 3 multisig is all it takes for this to never happen again. There is no way for the middleman to steal the bitcoin if this system is in place, right? He would need either the buyers or the sellers permittion.
