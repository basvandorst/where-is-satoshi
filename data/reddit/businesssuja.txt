Can someone explain like I am 5 on this?
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:11:05
how do you get all that info from the chart??? Like is the chart just for show/thumbnail?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:48:39
4 sold??? like what???
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:44:05
OHH soo I actually had to go there to see. So it was a freaking thumbnail. Ok ok. Learned something. Thank you!

If its being done with a cryptographic hash that conveys the digital currency behind.... Like paper wallets.... but you know. You can extract the value from it.
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:31:12
Any specific thing? Like ice cream?

:) Love it! These students are awesome!
@_date: 2016-02-26 01:26:03
Yea. define "fun" lol. So supposing I can develop the app, how much of a need is there for it? Would you willing to donate some bitcoins for me to put my time an effort into this?
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:41:27
True. Though they can go on OpenBazzar and sell through there. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:41:52
I was under the impression openbazzar was the app.
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:53:31
Point taken. So a hybrid model would. You can buy via bitcoin OR regular credit/cash. Of course, the fees would be lower if you bought or sell in bitcoins (so encouraging bitcoin use)
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:02:17
Hmm.... yea, not a fan of GMO either. Hell I'll make the app just for that. Screw gmo foods. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:14:14
haha, investing in the idea great. Its the execution is what I am worried about. 
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:48:26
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:10:41
Thanks. You are right, why would farmers use bitcoins lol. But maybe we already have and use bitcoins might. WE can sell to each other.
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:13:39
I see your point. Hmm... but it does deliver value to hardcore users in so far as making food available to bitcoin users? Maybe.. just maybe.  Maybe worth a shot. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 00:53:42
Ok. :)
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:00:20
Hmm.... ok. But once O.B is out as app, farmers can use it to open their own market right? there by eliminating any need for me to do app.
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:09:45
I love bitcoin. I love the very idea of a decentralized currency. That is why. I want to make it useable to normal people for everyday legal things. If I can help you buy food with it, my mission is a success. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:34:12
I was thinking more along the lines of   but you know, uses bitcoins. What do you think?
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:39:12
lol, they changed their model. They used to be only sharing food. I'd enable everyone to sell the food as well.
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:40:30
Wow, really positive stuff here... Awesome! 
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:55:41
Yes, yes you were! Thank you so much! I am trying to collect a  large number responses. The survey will close automatically when this number is reached. If you could upvote it so more people can do it, that would be great! Thank you for your time and I will post all related results as soon as the analysis is done!

Yep! Your helping mine satoshies!

Its an energy drink sold ONLY in bitcoin. Part of the profit will go towards a mining pool.
@_date: 2015-09-09 12:49:35


We do lean startups. $500 is enough for us. At least at this initial stage. This Reddit post is market research. 


  We want to add value to bitcoin as a whole by offering an energy drink (a healthy energy drink) exclusively to the bitcoin ecosystem. It will ONLY be sold in bitcoins. No fiat.  Plus some of the profits will go to a mining pool.
  Essentially it will also help normalize bitcoins too. 


  This account is linked to my actual twitter identity. It would be a really, really stupid idea to use it if I wanted to scam people.  My goal is to help make bitcoin normal to the average person. To that end I also did another start up. currencydigital.com  So no, its not a scam. 
 **The problem bitcoin face is one of media propaganda which causes normal people to shy away from it** I would use this as a means of countering that propaganda. If this is successful I can go on the mainstream media and say "Look there are  actual legitimate business that deal with bitcoin. Because bitcoins are awesome". That's essentially why I do this .
@_date: 2015-09-10 02:38:00
I want to essentially give back to the bitcoin ecosystem. I want to empower more people to mine and help out. X% of the profit must go to something. It doesn't have to minning. But something that has to do with bitcoin. Do you have any suggestions as to where the money goes?
@_date: 2015-03-18 03:31:28
Hmm... BitTorrent Sync could be used store and to sync the whole thing. So the site would need to be a place where you can have actual researcher/peers sign up and review the paper. Critique it and analyse it. 
  , want to make it happen?
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:09:16
Thank you for your suggestion. That is interesting. During our pretest, that was not one of the discrepancy we saw. Changes have been made to account for this linguistic discrepancy. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:20:36
What random shit do you have the most of? 
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:06:48
Hmm... what is the value they are not providing that you would like to see in the world?
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:04:09
They are built with wordpress and some other tech... thats really cool. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:01:17
its opening soon! They really do take a decentralized approach! WOW! 
@_date: 2015-10-30 03:23:09
What random shit do you want to buy the most of with you bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:53:26
No, I think you are missing the point. No on has ever done a non profit multivendor store. If that helps out bitcoins in the long run I am for it. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:27:56
We are assuming our customers already have bitcoins and are looking to spend it somewhere.  What we want to have is a flat all inclusive fee. A fee that combines all fees into one percentage point. And 10% is currently the best we can do.  But your point is taken we will see how to cut costs and still keep our severs running :)
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:02:13
Sure, there are already marketplaces that use Paypal. However, how many marketplaces in the United States do you know that allow you to make money by selling products with bitcoins without facing volatility? 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:58:23
No, I think you misunderstood. When you buy something via bitcoins at our site, it will automatically get converted to the dollar value at the that times rate. Then we will transfer those dollars to the merchant you bought from minus the transaction fee.
So you buy a $20 shirt and pay that $20 in bitcoins at that time period's rate. Instantly those bitcoins get converted to $20 and we give our merchant the $20 minus the transaction fee.
 Makes sense?
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:23:27
Point taken! The 10% fee is a flat 10%. its all fees combined. Using Paypal to pay our sellers means we have to Paypal a fee of at least 3%. So right now that 3% is included in the 10%. Does that make sense? 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:50:47
I think bitcoin prices will stabilize at some point. A technology such as bitcoins has huge implications. I am a believer in bitcoins. So I suppose i am acting in good faith. 


We are not a place that sells bitcoins.  Places like Coinbase does not require fingerprint id nor are they "shady".
Your argument boils down to something similar with Amazon and Walmart. Most business people went "why would anyone buy anything online if they can get it from their local Walmart?". 
But I get your point. What is the added value? I guess it would be, when your bank shuts you down and forecloses your home, you could still use bitcoins to buy basic everyday things on our site.
Aside from that, my goal is to prepare the average consumer for the inevitable future that is bitcoin. Sure today it looks messy, but in the future I believe every transaction will be in bitcoins!
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:27:59
Bitpay and Coinbase are not marketplaces. Though they have similar functions. However, I understand. All the replies have been about the 10% fee. We will work to lower that. :) All in an all, good feedback! Thank you all! 
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:07:22


They will be. Henry ford said "“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”". Granted I am not building bitcoin (Satoshi Nakamoto is WAAAAAYYYY smarter then I  could ever hope to be), however I am positive that this can help bring bitcoins into the mainstream.


Lol, are you trolling? Tell that to bitstamp and gox.
Bitstam and gox are different services then us. We do not sell or buy bitcoins. We do not store any bitcoins on our severs. Thus even if our severs are hacked, our customers will not lose their money.
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:55:10
Our back-end handles that. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:35:32
Bitpay is a payment processor not a multivendor marketplace. Coinbase is also a payment processor. Though Coinbase does have a many merchants and companies that use them to sell their products.  
Hmm... your point is valid to an extent.  We will see how if we can cut costs. Do you think 5% or 6% flat fee would be more competitive? 
This fee is inclusive of all fees. That is what we are going for. So the Paypal transfer fee of at 3% would have to be included in this fee. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:46:41


  No. I am not targeting those who already have their own bitcoin websites. 


Ok, even if I go below 1% why do you think Bitpay and Coinbase will eat me up? Because they already have clients that are huge and they have multi billion dollar VCs backing them up?
I have a few tricks up my sleeve. Not that easy to eat! 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:56:16
Thanks! :) We are also going to add dodgecoins into the mix next month or so. A dodgecoin billionaire such as yourself should be proud!  And we will obviously fix the fee!
@_date: 2015-02-26 04:13:26
A state run crytocurrency? Hmm... I'd like to see them attempt it. I wonder what will happen. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:51:09
No, honestly is good. Thank you for that. I'll do my best. The feedback is helpful! I am going to fix the 10% charge. The overall vision I have is to to make bitcoins more legitimate while helping everyday folks make a few dollars. To that end, we will revise our strategy as we go along!
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:59:53
No at this point, your two bits is my whole world! Thank you! :') What would you like to buy? What would you like to sell? How can I add value to your life? 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:17:06
The cost isn't bitcoin. Its to keep our servers running. Do you think it would be viable to have a fundraiser every month to cover server costs much like reddit? Its an option we are looking into. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:30:31
:) Thank you! Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:11:55
$100 sale still gets you $90. 90/100 is still an A in my book! But ok, what do you think the pricing should be? What percentage are you willing to pay? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:26:26


How safe is your credit cards and bank accounts? With bitcoins you have no risk of hacking and zero chargeback. 


Weather something is easy or not is relative. There are already people with bitcoins looking to spend them and there are people who want to make dollars. Join the two and you have a win win situation. 


So you think bitcoin is fake money? Like monopoly money? Bitcoin may not be a feasible store of value (given the volatility) at the moment, but it is a form of money (medium of exchange). 


Nope, thats not needed. People will switch to bitcoins as it happens. Why do you think so many people are already switching? Look at Greece!
@_date: 2016-07-12 22:25:47
This is how its done!
