How do "physical futures" work??
@_date: 2019-07-22 22:29:00
Oh wow. Okay, thanks for explaining! I appreciate the help!

So the actual Bitcoin part is really interesting to me. By physical bitcoin, will they just give the person a piece of paper like they do with stocks? Or do you think they'll make coins or something like that?

Damn that's long. What's the tldr?
@_date: 2019-09-03 16:09:00
Why is that?

Quick question! I'm using the Lightning Labs program for now to get a hang of things. It says it can automatically open channels for me, but I'm also able to open them on my own. Are there any resources for finding the best channels? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-28 01:11:02
Yeah! That's what it was. Thanks! I'll take a look into it. I keep getting a "bootstrap error" but I think that's because I dont have a channel yet

Ahhhh okay, that makes a bit more sense. I'll do the research and figure out the best option. Thanks for explaining!

Thank you for your reply! What's the benefit of having a dedicated device with a bitcoin core node?
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:38:25
Yeah that's also $400 Canadian for me. I think an alternative would be better for me right now.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:42:06
I had no clue that existed! I'll definitely do my research on this. But what are the benefits of a full node vs not having a full node? (Thank you for your reply!)
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:20:09
Awesome! Thanks for the reply, I'll check it out!

How exactly does this work? Does the 0.1 BTC mean that's all it can load on to the wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-27 06:28:35
Awesome! Thank you for your reply. I think in going to watch a few tutorials and read the instructions before picking everything up! Thanks for the reply!
