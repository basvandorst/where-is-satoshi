Wow, a comment about an exchange that isn't "&lt;exchange X&gt; REALLY SUCKS!!!"
It's the first time it's ever happened on this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:59:07
Thank you!  You always show up when you're most needed....

Paging we need you!

Yeah, on that graph you can really see the CPU-&gt;GPU transition and then the GPU-&gt;ASIC transition.  There is nothing faster than an ASIC except a faster ASIC from a process with smaller geometry, so we've already see all the big leaps we are going to see.

That was true in the past but it's not true anymore.  Renouncing has potential tax issues and they are complicated.  It can cause immediate tax liability.  But the way you've stated it is not true.

Certainly, the hash rate will continue to increase more than linearly because manufacturing processes will continue to become smaller and cheaper.
There's not going to be any kind of a "super-ASIC" that has an instant 10x to 100x improvement like the CPU-&gt;GPU or the GPU-&gt;ASIC jumps.  The problem is that the way mining works is based on doing lots of SHA256 hashes, and there's only so much you can do to optimize that.  In the end you need X transistors to do the whole calculation.  You can make them smaller, cheaper and faster by changing the manufacturing process (e.g., 14 nm -&gt; 10 nm), but that's only incremental speed.  It's not a huge jump like GPU-&gt;ASIC

Wait until your barber or hairdresser tells you that they've bought their first fraction of a bitcoin.  THAT will be the time to sell.
