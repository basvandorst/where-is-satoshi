PayPal and Bitcoin = No

This is (one of the reasons) why Bitcoin is worth $9k.

The first blocks were empty and simply collected the reward.

Oh yeah, totally trustworthy cointopal.com...

I guess what you're trying to say is that you think the price increase due to the reduced supply by someone losing coins is less than the potential price decrease due to the reduced demand by the fear of accidentally losing coins. Time will tell if that's true or not.

When you actually *use* bitcoin sometimes you have to sell at a "bad" price.

[Exit scam](

Buy more to lower the average price of your bitcoins.

The payment fails. Also I think it's irrelevant whether the invoice has an amount or not. The receiver doesn't know what route the sender will choose or even the balances in the intermediate hops (if any) so it's impossible to calculate a maximum "safe" amount. It's worth noting that the amount is more like a suggestion as the sender can send any amount actually (the wallet software will most likely force the amount at UI level though).

Can you post the tx id(s) that you used to fund your account?
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:33:49
Thanks for reducing the supply and making our bitcoins more valuable.

What mixer did you use?

Just in case I wasn't clear enough, I asked for deposit transaction hash(es) aka tx id(s).
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:30:33
That means both parties of a trade must be online and have their signing device ready. It would be extremely slow, and not to mention atomic swap is mandatory (or else what happens if one party signs the transaction but not the other?). This might work for something like Localbitcoins but not for a real time exchange like Binance or Bitfinex.

Admittedly I don't think this story is real so my comment is not really serious.

I've seen this problem before, but it never lasted so long. It's been several hours now. And not only one transaction, but 3 transactions on 3 different addresses.

For an exit scam the operator normally doesn't want to shut down their service immediately, but rather keep it running so people keep depositing money and they end up with more.

Tipping is a [problematic]( use case for LN for a number of reasons. In general you will have to generate a new invoice for each payment.

I feel like you're already there, otherwise you wouldn't be complaining here.
@_date: 2013-03-24 13:11:18
I created a support ticket, but no answer so far. A few weeks ago I created a ticket for another problem and I never received a reply (but it got fixed), so I'm not sure if they even get the tickets. By the way the transactions are over 100 confirmations now and they have not been forwarded yet. I'm starting to freak out!
@_date: 2013-03-24 02:37:15
You can see the Bitcoins on the temp address on blockchain, but they did not get forwarded to the final address. I didn't test this particular address, because it's an automated process. But it's been working fine for months until now. Also I tried sending a small amount to an old temp address that was set up in the same way to forward to my address (and worked in the past) and it didn't work either. These temp addresses don't expire afaik, so it's probably a momentary glitch (I hope).
@_date: 2013-03-24 20:25:18
Transactions are slowly being forwarded. One of them got forwarded about 5 hours ago and the other one about half an hour ago. It took over 24 hours to get forwarded! I'm not comfortable with this, so I'll probably switch to some other forwarder. Thanks for your help :)

I'm not sure how Mt.Gox could be causing this problem.

The fees paid on this transaction is exactly the recommended amount.
0.0005 * roundup(transaction-size / 1000)
Since transaction-size = 1847 then:
0.0005 * roundup(1847 / 1000) = 0.0005 * roundup(1.847) = 0.0005 * 2 = 0.001
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:11:14
That's normal since you didn't include fees.
@_date: 2013-07-11 19:18:19
Seems legit: 
@_date: 2013-04-04 01:33:50
It's working now, but it took almost 24 hours for the transaction to get included in a block!
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:52:57
Did you include fees? If not, then it's the expected behavior.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:03:08
How long did it take?
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:17:30
Oh I thought it was confirmed already. Did you include fees? In my case 0.001 was the recommended amount for that transaction size.
