Every miner is mining in "One pool". The way you think of mining pools describes a co-operation where all miners in that coop agree to share rewards. Realistically only one miner in the greater pool is solving each block. However by sharing his reward, on the assumption his peers will share with him, said miner can have steady fractional reward bonuses instead of waiting 25 years for 1 massive payout.

Segwit can be rolled back its planned to be implemented as a soft fork. It is also compatible with non segwit blocks. So most likely if implemented there will be regular blocks added for some time.

Not that im aware of. There is one exchange that lets you depisit money with paypall. And ultimatley exchange your paypal $ for BTC. 
The biggest reason people avoid paypal -&gt; btc is the large amount of paypal scammers. They steal accounts pay for digital goods and run off with the btc. Paypal fraud usually catches them in a few days and returns the money to the customer from the merchant account. As a merchant i would then not be able to get my btc returned, and i lost the money.
