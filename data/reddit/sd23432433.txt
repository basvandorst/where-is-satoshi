I do find it interesting that the cryptosphere somehow chose to be located under the cctld of a US/UK sovereign military base.. I doubt it's a coincidence - although I don't exactly understand how the trend jumpstarted.

The transfer is probably fearmongering and tbh, I don't see any justification for the US continuing to run it either.. however the concerns are still valid - whoever is running it.
While it isn't ICANN's habitual practice to delete individual domains, they set the overall policy and could create procedures that make it easier to force registrars to delete them. All registrars are under contract to ICANN (at least for non-national TLDs) and it's not like they can just contract with someone else so they will pretty much be forced to go along with whatever ICANN says.
Right now it's fairly easy to grief any domain holder by paying a $1000 WIPO arbitration fee to challenge their domain and they need to respond and possibly hire lawyers in order to fight that off.. changes in the policy could make that worse and might be a good way for governments to censor domains.
There have been many attempts to introduce competing/alternate DNS roots but none of them have been able to achieve more than a tiny niche following. This isn't a realistic solution.
ICANN operates the IANA who issue IP address allocations to the regional internet registries (who then issue them to ISPs).. perhaps there is some policy change they could enact that would make it easier to shut down access to a website. This is a fairly vague and non-specific threat, but I wouldn't dismiss it.. in general the internet is becoming less free and there's a good chance in the future we'll look back and blame it on the DOC giving up control of ICANN - even though it probably would end up being similar if had kept it.
