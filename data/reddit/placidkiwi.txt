Here's the thread that finally got me started: 
I initially purchased BTC through Coinbase and then transferred to the Electrum Wallet on my phone. When my investment approaches 5 figures I'll be looking into hardware wallets. But Electrum serves me just fine. When I got started, I initially transferred £5 worth of BTC to the wallet and then deleted the app to ensure I could use the seed to recover. Make sure you secure the app with a PIN too, just in case your phone goes missing.

Nope. I got onboard a few weeks ago with £100 in Coinbase. I've added a couple of small amounts since then and my profit is 280% so far!

Right now, they do not.

Never too late. I regret not buying in when I first came across BTC in 2012. I then regretted not buying in 2013, 2014 and so on until September. I decided to put in a flat £100 to test the water and that is now worth £233.
I've been buying small incrementals ever since and have no regrets. Quickest way to get started was to buy through Coinbase and transferred the BTC to my Electrum wallet. I use a dynamic Google Sheet to track the value of my BTC in Stirling.

It was already mentioned above that you don't have to drop 8K to purchase a whole bitcoin. You can buy smaller amounts. 
Ten weeks ago, for a laugh (and to satisfy my own curiosity) I put £100 into Coinbase and purchase 0.038 BTC. That £100 is now worth £233. That's a 133% return that I could never achieve elsewhere in such a short space of time. I've since converted a little more but I'm a long ways off from a whole bitcoin. 
I'm using a dynamic Google Sheet to track the value of my bitcoins in pounds stirling. No plans to withdraw anything this year. Perhaps I can use the profit to have a nice holiday next year.
