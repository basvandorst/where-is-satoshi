For the majority of people who keep their Bitcoin in an exchange like coinbase, do they decide or does coinbase?

Seg? Any sources for further reading?
Who is in charge of determining how many more and when? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of Bitcoin being a decentralized network without a central bank just printing new money as they see fit?

The year 2140, though we will hit 80% early next year. Leaving about 4.2 million to be mined over the next 122 years compared to the 16.8 million mined over the first 7 years of bitcoins existence.

A quick Google will produce a lot of different FAQs about the limit and thoughts on how it could affect Bitcoin in the long run. Reading now, hard to know who is right and not wearing Rose colored glasses.

Yes but we don't have to get to the actual limit for anxiety about it to take place, or for it to stop making financial sense, just getting close would effectively be the same. Seems like that would happen a hell of a lot sooner than 2140. 
BTW, just arguing so I can understand better, I appreciate the responses.

Newby question. 
What happens when all 21 million bitcoin are mined? How is anyone incentivized to continue processing transactions?

 But seems like the vast majority of Bitcoin are owned as a speculative investment vehicle rather than to used as an actual currency. Seems like that needs to change for Bitcoin to thrive after the 21 million are mined.

Thank you so much, I did enjoy it. Can you recommend some good resources to keep up to date on this and other bitcoin news? Is this sub a good place? Personally it seems to have a pretty strong bias.

Can you explain? I'm fairly new to Bitcoin

It's not my project. I just stumbled upon it and thought it was fairly interesting, even if flawed.
