Both use Euros. Until last Friday you could open up a German bank account, wire your money over and receive a bank card that you could use to withdraw money from Greek ATMs without any charges even though most Greek bank have withdrawal charges. If you needed more money you could just write yourself a cheque and take it to the nearest bank.

I have not seen it being used in any of my wallets, instead we have mBTC and μBTC

I know but I always found it annoying having to look for my own bank's ATMs to avoid the fees, especially in the heat in islands. Deutsches Konto will reimburse any ATM fees charged by banks outside Germany. So even if they charge you you won't really pay any of it.

Because they can sell it online and ask the buyer to deposit the money to their German bank account.

Or bitreserve. It allows you to keep your money locked to EUR, GBP, USA, CHY or any other of the major currencies. It would be much easier to market that to Greek people as it essentially acts like a bank where you can only deposit and withdraw using bitcoin but you don't have to go through the thrills that can come with cryptos.

well you were half right

Buy the coins with cash you would have spent on your electric bill. People with more efficient hardware can mine it for you for less then you can.

I trusted you man! I just invested my whole pension fund into bitcoin! How could you? I will never trust another stranger on reddit again...
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:57:20
Well... It looks looks it's time for you to buy again. To the flooooor! I have agreed I won't be selling anything as I have already written off my investments. I am in it for the ride.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:37:33
Yeah that won't happen unless something renders bitcoin useless. £21 mil market cap?
@_date: 2015-07-16 19:01:46
He is talking about buying bitcoin and spending it straight away. As it has been mentioned ITT circle does that.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:45:17
I would also like to give you a big congratulations for being so up to date with technology and offering everyday citizens the chance to easily purchase bitcoins. I would like to thank your mum, your teachers and your friends that have made it possible for you to change the world in such a wonderful way.

Cant be easy managing the authorisation of millions of transactions with 0 errors.

OP did not deliver.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:11:18
Because the past does not predict the future but people believe it does.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:09:57
Its ok they only stole the worthless fiat inside.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:16:45
uphold.com but they are anti bitcoin apparently.  Still works great.
@_date: 2015-10-28 08:43:48
Write a complaint to the bitcoin CEO.
@_date: 2015-10-28 23:25:55
Firstly I never called him a dummy. In the example I gave him he would have lost $300 yet he seems to think that selling high at $350 and buying lower at $250 means he can never loose. 
He doesn't want to listen to me so I was hoping maybe he will read something about it instead. I think people should at least understand the concept and refrain from thinking they have a sure ticket to the moon. 
You can always loose your money, if you understand that at least you can take planned risk.
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:26:10
Hopefully $1 coins.

You wouldn't dp a virgin.
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:07:31
This made me laugh xD I can picture it.
@_date: 2015-10-28 22:25:12
Ok friendly chap. 
Carry on with your basic math.
@_date: 2015-10-28 21:52:32
Because you dont have a crystal ball and like you said you cant tell when the swing will end. One day you will sell at 350 only for it to continue at 500 and then buy again at 250 only for it to drop down to 100. 
Both of those time you will lose revenue no matter the denomination.
If you think you are so good at predicting trends get an uphold account and change from dollars to bitcoin at 0% fees and watch how your wallets will empty over time.

have 6 months of savings on the side before investing.

And if your plane crashes the value of a house stored in your head is automatically distributed across every bitcoin owner.

Poor wallet :(
