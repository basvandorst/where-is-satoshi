'lil story: 
me this morning entering the office 
me:  hey did you see? The bubble is finally popping colleague: aha I told you! Now you won't even be able to panic sell because exchanges are clogged
me: no intention to sell any of my coins, if you want to do so I could actually help you...but I'll buy yours at 10k, no more
colleague: ...

Well said brotha!

They will disappear eventually. It's like if bitcoin is a Trojan horse, many get attracted by quick money and then they stay for the sound money. Altcoin offer quick money (speculation) buy not sound money.

Fair enough...upvoted
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:35:13
Every couple of years they come and they go, now it's the time to flush this toilet full of shitcoins :D
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:11:09
How to get rekt?
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:13:24
"now we're seeing tons of coins that do important things that bitcoin cannot currently do" ... like what for example?
@_date: 2018-05-19 08:57:16
I use it quite often, I have some bits from '15 and I'm not afraid of spending them :D
@_date: 2018-05-30 08:55:13
That's what trump and other leaders would like to see happening. Don't fall for this propaganda.
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:36:00
Then they are insecure by definition

airbaltic.com should accept bitcoin for your bookings, unfortunately I don't know many other. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 13:40:04
They should have used btcpayserver..

Is all just words until he eventually gets in charge, pushing away government money would be one of the most reckless things a president can do. Imagine him firing lots of federal reserve employees..LOL

Openbazaar decided to be bitcoin unfriendly for some reasons :(
@_date: 2018-06-08 16:40:54
Why? What's wrong with it?
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:21:20
Like many countries in EU
@_date: 2019-06-06 07:41:59
I found it really hard to use
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:31:31
ETH what??
@_date: 2019-06-16 11:05:37
Oh noice OP is revealing himself as shitcoiner, I smelled the BS all along this thread and I was right! Sorry to break it down for you but BTC is actually the best working at the moment, most secure and with the best tools (wallets). Other shitcoins are worthless because they add nothing technically interesting and nobody uses them apart for speculation. You can use BTC today, with low fees and instant confirmation, if choose other coins you probably have been fooled.
@_date: 2019-06-10 07:18:22
Yep fees will rise and not everyone will afford to pay them, there are solutions but it's kind of a hard truth.
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:22:10
Yes transactions have a cost and that's very necessary for bitcoin's security. If you want to save on fees you can start batching your purchases and use a good wallet (must support bech32 addresses), also when you make a transaction you can adjust the fees: if you're okay waiting a few days you can save up to 90% of the fees. When all of the above is still not enough then is time for you to get a LN channel and move your holdings through that.
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:42:22
But why are you willing to exchange bitcoin for shitcoins instead of using proper techniques to avoid high fees on bitcoin?

Spending some sats after hodling is absolutely awesome, where we're going we won't need to convert to fiat anymore
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:50:26
Tons of devs warned Vitalik that using Turing completeness was a mistake, just like for their "rich statefulfness" and now  check out the "what's the problem" section :D. But sure in the meantime they got filthy rich so it's justified
@_date: 2019-12-17 15:36:17
1) propose shitty project
2) ignore all feedback telling you the design is broken
3) call "close minded" anyone who doesn't buy the crap
@_date: 2019-12-30 10:38:17
It doesn't matter how much you stack but how long you HODL
@_date: 2019-12-21 10:51:38
Have you tried phoenix wallet?
@_date: 2019-04-28 08:14:32
I disagree, ethereum's innovation was to try something that we knew already was flawed, on the other hand bitcoin kept advancing at a blistering pace.
@_date: 2019-04-19 10:49:26
LND is Not the Lightning Network
Lightning Labs is not the community

Finally we can get rid of the trading pair USD/BTC as a reference
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:45:42
In bitcoin there is no ship that has sailed, no train that has departed it ONLY matters how long do you HODL
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:04:05
Then we make an EIP to wipe it out ��
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:07:27
Jeez why so much fuss for a couple of shitcoins? Let's just ignore them and coinbase.
