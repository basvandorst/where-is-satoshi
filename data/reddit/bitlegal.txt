True, Iceland has a large concentration of mining, so far this seems to be permitted as long as Icelandic citizens don't touch them.

Will do, have gotten a few requests for that.

Iceland instituted very strict capital controls after the financial crisis in 2008. These laws restrict the use of Bitcoin so as to prevent citizens from moving money out of the country.

Indeed there should, we're working on a better gradient of legality at the moment.

The statements from the Russian authorities have been very hostile. It's best to take anything out of Russia with a grain of salt, but this is looking like the real deal. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:10:33
Must've been a different map, we just added Russia a couple days ago, it's been yellow for that period to my knowledge.

This is in no way a ban, that title is a bit misleading. The official release from BI is basically stating that it does not recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. The statement they issued urging caution is similar to the guidance issued by nearly every country's central bank. 
This all comes after earlier statements from BI indicated they might be taking a far more hostile attitude than what we're seeing today.

Hey, creator of BitLegal here. Thanks for posting this again! I think the site launch got buried the other day amidst all the GHash and Overstock news. 
I just want to let the community know that you can now submit your own summaries and revisions to the site by going [here](

Previously, there was uncertainty over whether Bitcoin fell under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance in Thailand, which had originally issued very harsh statements against Bitcoin. This most recent letter asserts that Bitcoin exchange operations do not fall under the scope of Ministry of Finance regulation, unless foreign currencies are also offered for exchange.

Thanks bud, stay tuned.

I think you're correct, the goal of these laws is primarily to prevent capital flight out of Iceland, what you did seems permissible. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 19:32:59
Good idea, I'll set that up. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 17:15:59
Thanks for the writeup, looks good!

Thanks dude!

We've also got a great resource going at [BitLegal]( We're just about finished integrating the new info covered by this Congressional Report. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 14:54:28
It certainly is, however, these laws were not imposed as a reaction to Bitcoin, but rather to stem capital flight after the financial crisis in 2008. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 20:28:20
Thanks, we've got some great new content coming soon. We're just getting started at this point.

Bank Indonesia did not declare it a legal *currency* but they did deviate from their stance in the past in which virtual currency use was seen to be in [violation]( of a number of banking regulations.
