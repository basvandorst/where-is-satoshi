Yet if I want to buy $100 worth it costs me $15??

A tantrum that decreased transaction fees by how many percent exactly?
@_date: 2019-07-16 01:48:17
Need a daddy? Oh nm

So you'll just have to lock up $50 worth of BTC to open a channel with the lemonade stand, paying fees to open and close it too. LN is great!!!

Good idea because when it goes up another 1000 percent you won't care because you'll still have a pupper! :D
@_date: 2018-09-14 03:02:30
You FAT CATS didn't finish your bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-09-28 01:54:49
What about tumblers?
@_date: 2018-08-12 01:37:11
BUY! BUY!! BUY!!!

It's the younger generations that are going to grow crypto (well, already are).
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:34:54
You've just completely contradicted your original sentiment.

Someone's going short.
@_date: 2018-08-12 21:51:38
Noice :)
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:26:09
Perhaps. It's always good to keep a diversified portfolio, and thankfully I can afford to lose what I've put in if dies completely (which is not likely to happen imo).
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:22:38
Crypto is notoriously difficult to predict. I'd say at this point it's still anybody's game though.
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:49:08
Same! Still feels a little shitty when you throw down another ~150, then it drops by another 30% though haha.
@_date: 2018-05-01 06:34:07
No pineapple?
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:35:57
I really hope so.

He's saying (I think?) That he sold his “free” bcash into actual bitcoin and is quite happy about it. 
@_date: 2018-10-07 07:42:21
Thank you, I didn't actually know that.
I knew the fee was voluntary, but the transaction has to be within a reasonable amount of time to be practicable I suppose.
5-15 cents ain't bad at all.
@_date: 2018-10-09 22:11:13
Painfully accurate.
@_date: 2018-10-07 07:01:39
How much would the transaction fee be for stuff like this? As in &lt; $10 purchases.

What is he doing with his tongue :/
@_date: 2019-04-29 01:55:32
You missed the part where it takes 30 minutes to be confirmed.
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:08:43
Wtf did I just read... :/
@_date: 2018-04-30 14:41:12
My condolences to your country's fashion sense.
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:42:27
This is never okay...
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:42:29
I'm offended in general. Shorts and a suit jacket is *never* okay.
