For a long time apple refused to allow any bitcoin apps because they couldn't tell when they're scams. They gave in to pressure and started allowing them. This is a side-effect.
I would encourage anyone who can to use the report button so we can get these removed.

Thanks, just curious. Keep up the good work.

This month I've made two purchases from Adafruit and I paid a house sitter in BTC.

Thanks for the reply. I've read the FAQ and I think the terminal makes a lot of sense for retailers. But now you've got two terminals, one labeled for retailers and one labeled "exchange". The Exchange version has several features that normal retailers won't need (such as the scanner). Do you expect that the full-featured terminal will be as popular as the less-expensive one? I understand that such a question may not be one you'd want to answer, but thanks for your time.

Not a bad plan. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:41:08
Good to know. Does anyone know where such various fees are listed on their website? I couldn't find any.
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:31:27
Thanks. I know you said you prefer email, but I imagine the others here wouldn't mind seeing the answers.
What is the 1% on POS sales? Is that just on the terminal and paid by the seller if he has one of those two account types?
The Starter plan shows a 50% exchange markup share. Again, is this only for terminal owners and only when their terminal is being used?
Thank you for clarifying the pricing page.

Don't count on it. There's talk of Apple developing a payment system. This makes sense considering their anti-Bitcoin stance. If that happens, Starbucks will be with the Apple camp, not Bitcoin.

Great work! Your wallets got me started with bitcoin. Have a beer @_date: 2014-02-18 15:45:15
I love the concept of the Exchange terminal, but if you wouldn't mind, how do you envision these being used? The retail terminal is obvious but for buying and selling, how does the terminal compare to using a phone, tablet, or computer? What about issues like escrow for in-person exchanges?
@_date: 2016-03-14 12:47:43
I think you misunderstand somewhat. Apple doesn't have a key to your phone. They have a key that allows them to write software for your phone. Yes it's somewhat like a back door, but there's no better way at this point.
Also that key can't be used to access your data. What the FBI wants is for Apple to write a new OS using that key that will allow them to guess the password without the phone erasing its data. Apple's key by itself doesn't do that.
I never implied that the NSA doesn't have the key. They may very well have it and I think it's suspicious that the NSA has been so quiet throughout the debate. Honestly the FBI may have it too. It seems to me that they're just making a show of it all.
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:47:57
I will *mostly* agree with you there. Which is why I originally called it "somewhat like a backdoor". In my mind it doesn't really fit the description exactly, but it's close enough to be called one.
@_date: 2014-08-19 13:34:25
This certainly isn't as frequent as what you found. I wonder what it's all about.
@_date: 2016-03-14 18:40:55
It's still not really a backdoor because even if they give you a naughty update, the data is still locked and unreadable.
Many suspect that soon the phone will need to be unlocked to update, with the option to erase all data.
@_date: 2016-03-14 11:45:41
Not really. I'll try to explain without getting into the details of keypair encryption.
Apple has a secret key. Very few people at Apple will have the ability to access it. When a new version of iOS is released, it's digitally signed with that secret key. When you update your phone, the phone checks to be sure the signature matches (thus verifying that the software came from Apple and not some baddie). The FBI cannot load GovtOS onto the phone because they don't have the key.
They also don't have access to the original iOS source code. Making a change to the existing could may be simple. Starting over from scratch would not.

Red herring. It’s a non-issue.
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:50:02
Thanks! Does that imply that I should start using SegWit to receive new transactions, even if I don’t move what I currently have?
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:31:35
You realize there's no price without buying and selling?
@_date: 2017-01-27 23:44:29
It looks right in iOS 10.2.1.

This is a question of precision, not accuracy.

Ok, so I don’t actually have to call my lawyer. I don’t think he’d get the crypto part anyway.

Is there something special about 21?
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:30:12
First, I recommend buying two. OP is talking about £10k worth of bitcoin. It's worth spending a couple hundred to get two.
Second, the trezor uses a seed mechanism for generating keys. You keep the seed in a safe place and they can be used to recover your keys on a new device (and even some wallets).
@_date: 2016-05-09 23:50:49
It's got a custom firmware. In fact the next version will be android.

Thanks! I usually let electrum decide the fee, but I was trying to sweep the wallet, so that made it tricky.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:39:43
I gave a bit of an explanation [here]( but the bottom line is that the electrum people don’t like their project being used for Bitcoin Cash. As I said below, it’s a real concern that the binaries are anonymous, but using their own directory is a red herring.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:37:52
There are two issues listed in this one tweet:
1. Electron Cash (renamed from Electrum Cash because they didn’t have permission to use the name) copies all your files from the electrum directory to a new electron cash directory. This actually feels like the right thing to do. They two programs cannot be accessing the same files because there’s a divergence in the block chain. Copying the files means the user doesn’t have export private keys, thereby exposing them.
2. The binaries are anonymous,  meaning there’s no real guarantee that they are coming from the open source. That would definitely concern me.

I understand you're working on improving, but it's just plain not good enough. We're talking about real money here and your staff seems to have no desire to fix huge issues. Have have once again made a purchase that Coinbase won't let me transfer out. Your support staff takes days (or sometimes weeks) between replies while fixing nothing.

And frankly they built their business on things like free shipping. It kinda defeats the purposes when the customer has to pay a $6 transaction fee.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:06:17
Hmm. It's a thought, thanks. It unfortunately requires the customer to use coinbase as well.
