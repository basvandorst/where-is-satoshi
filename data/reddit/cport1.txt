The problem is Bitcoin (say gold) is being replaced by better metals that are stronger, faster, more secure. Thus, your gold is turning into iron real quick.

The company you work for probably has a development team 100 times larger than coinbase then. Stop trying to kid yourself. Coinbase could give two fucks about the lightning network.

It is that easy already with multiple services. That's not going to be a selling point for the general public to trade their currency for bitcoin.

I think that's the problem with Bitcoin and crypto currencies right now. It seems a lot of people are just buying it in hopes it's going to make them wealthy instead of actually using it. Some of you care more about "rubbing it in people's faces" instead of helping and coaching adoption.  It really gives bitcoin a bad name.
