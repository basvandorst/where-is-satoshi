Is there any other sources saying the same thing? What would this mean for mining in the rest of the world?
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:21:33

Say I found the phrase (I haven't), but what would I want to do to claim the account/recover the account with the phrase?
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:42:35
I was trying to do some crazy math and calculations with the words to try to find the phrase, but you really brought me back down to earth with that comment
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:01:56
This also corresponds to the relative size of the words in the image... also remember me if you crack it
Edit: yeah I’m totally wrong here. Disregard

Why not make the program start checking 13,14,15 words after it figures 12 is not the solution. Understandably, checking for 12 with the current information will take over a day.

When price dips just buy more. Never sell, only buy dips

Holy cow, I had no idea each receiving address only saw the transactions of that specific receiving address. I guess this should have been obvious, but I see now. Thanks
@_date: 2019-08-19 05:39:14
I guess I should add a little more info to why I’m asking this question. If I was to release an app with the receiving address in the app for receiving donations, would this be advised against due to users being able to look up the receiving address and see all of its transactions?
Edit: I understand now, only the transactions made with the receiving address in the app can be see. The transactions of the entire wallet are still obfuscated from the user, if they were to look the receiving address up.
@_date: 2019-08-19 05:51:30
What happens when you use each receiving address associated with your wallet? There wouldn’t be anymore new addresses?

Sorry for the late response.
Correct, to be more detailed, I’m mining ethereum and auto exchanging for bitcoin. 50-75 cents per day at current prices. Last year at this time, I was mining +25 dollars per day. Same hardware. Mining in a pool.
Edit: yes 24/7, gpus stay under 65c, kept in a small pantry with no door and has a fan constantly circulating the air

Bitcoin community is the best keep HODLing!!!
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:28:47
Currently mining with a $0 electric bill, it’s a flat rate built into my rent, and no overage charges. Been mining for a little over a year now with no worries 
Edit: with 6 570 AMD gpus, I’m getting less than 75 cents a day if you happened to be interested. But no real reason to stop at this point. Not worried about burning out cards or whatnot, just going to ride it out for however long I can
@_date: 2019-09-24 22:20:04
Yeah I did too, no biggie. Just bought more lol.  I’m with bitcoin for the long run. I wouldn’t sell at any price
@_date: 2019-05-14 19:52:09
It’ll go below 3k-4k before it goes to 100k. We will dip low before the next halving. Roughly 6-12 months before halving. Then bull run start 1-12 months after halving that will push up to 100k and potentially past it depending on media coverage. 
Alternatively, governments ban bitcoin and the value goes below 1k. Guess we’ll just wait and see.
Also, literally anything else could happen. No one really knows for sure what’s going to happen. HDOL to the moon is all that matters

I’m wanting to transfer my assets to local storage. I’d rather not store Bitcoin on my computer. What’s the go to usb wallet? Or should I be looking into another option? I don’t want to use a paper wallet, I understand that it’s the most secure, but I also want ease of access and to be able to receive and send, like buying coffee (if that means keeping a small amount on say Coinbase to make purchases and keeping the rest on a usb of some type I’m fine with that, I just don’t want to keep everything on an exchange any longer)
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:35:55
HDOL and buy the dip!!
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:08:45
Just saying anything could happen. Governments could make it illegal to use in stores. Obviously, online purchases would be much more difficult to stop, considering the anonymity of bitcoin transactions.   
I don’t see anything like this ever happening, but I’m just trying to say no one knows what the future holds for bitcoin
Governments get scared of things that they don’t understand, and the government heads that do understand may see the danger to the USD that bitcoin might have.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:04:44
I’m still buying... anyone got anymore of those dips... 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:27:26
