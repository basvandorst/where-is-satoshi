18 days ago you were a noob asking "can you mine bitcoin" and in that period you became an expert on its technology.. pack it up guys if this guy says so its gotta be true.. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:16:46
same here, much appreciated 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:36:17
Thats why people are flocking to alts/shitcoins hoping for those "crazy gainz" not realising 90% will die out so will their money..
Greed is a nasty thing..

you re not late, buy btc when ever you can with the amount you could lose and not care.. this question has been asked for 4-5 years now..

Shut up and give me my card!

4 newbies in my company bought BTC today, pretty much 90% of my company are normal people not really into cryptoc. but they heard and know about btc and now they all hold btc.. I asked them do you care if atm the time for a transaction is long nobody gives a shit.. people care for long term investment and in time issues like that will be solved.

well I m putting in all my hashing power towards a pool that supports segwit plus full time node that only accepts BIP148. I believe it will help.. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:16:46
I did that! phew.. the moment I wasnt sure (few months ago) that F2pool would or wouldnt support BIP148 I switched to Slush.
After all these years and after all the hussle as a small miner I m not giving in to some corporate douchebags who want to be the next billioners atleast not without a fight, I m not after millions or lambos... I m trying to save up something to have somewhat easier life in this shitty ass world. So again, thanks Luke for contributing to an idea that gives that opportunity to a small person.

did you really take your time to create a new reddit account just to troll in r/bitcoin? are you people at r/btc that butthurt? listen friend, you can fork and take your coin away from us... but hey do have the balls to return after you realise you fucked up again, as other failed attempts of forking..good luck

so the original wallet with X amount is the backup for the new wallet which received the amount X and the new wallet with the new private keys is imported to a BCC supported wallet? am I getting this right?
@_date: 2017-07-30 21:36:33
another stupid question,what if I dont move my btcs from my existing wallet? do I just miss out on the bcc or something else might happen?
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:03:12
holy shit! I only read your name in other articles as a contributor, never thought I d see ya on my post :D thank you for your effort and work you invested in Bitcoin... thank you for giving me a chance to have a brighter future with bitcoin. Ohh and I m using slushpool.. think they confirmed BIP148.
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:23:01
how in the world do you figure that out? I wasnt taking any sides for years, because I had my miners up and running and wasnt paying any attention to the community. Until this year when I started reading about Segwit, and I read both sides of the story... listened to podcasts, reports. Firstly the impression Jihan and Ver give is terrible, the last conference with that fake ass loud mouth Satoshi is cringe worthy and I wouldnt give 1 dollar to their idea,cause or whatever they were selling..
All the data Core provided was transparent, there are way more developers working on the code..the other side doesnt give that much info, and dont link me github I m not that technicall nor is the 80% of btc users.. we read reviews for that part. Everything I found when I was forming my opinion was against the BU coin, or the miner side.. just the fact that they have the only factory for miners, the biggest hashrate should tell you they cant be up to any good... My business and life experience tells me they already are corrupt or soon will be... and they want absolute power which absolutely corrupts.

besides the full node I pointed all my miners to slushpool! 
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:01:06
i know its not much , but all my miners and 2 nodes are supporting BIP148! 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:45:52
I read this , so i m in a situation that my laptop with electrum wallet comes online only to transfer funds.. and this part confuses me a bit : "Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed" ... i ve got my existing Electrum wallet with all the funds, seed extracted, private keys exported.. 
So do I need to export it again into a new wallet? why? wouldnt I have to export those seeds and private key again? 
And to get bcc , seed and private keys should be imported into a new wallet that supports BCC like bitcoin core wallet?

dont think paypal is supported its either credit card or bank transfer.. its easy to sign up on both markets and you can check the means of payment.. As I said I m not using exchanges, I m a miner and a hodler.

Took me 3 years to get to this level..
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:34:59
I ve moved from f2pool , moved to slush and even getting more hash than I did on the old pool
@_date: 2017-06-29 17:37:06
Pardon my intrusion, but what happens if I m mining and sending btc to the address where the rest of my btc is? I m using Electrum, got few miners pointing at slush pool.. should I store current balance to another wallet?

I dont use Coinbase, but most  people I know that are new to the crypto world use Coinbase cause its user friendly and WHEN they work it all goes pretty much smoothly.
@_date: 2017-06-16 09:51:19
Your location doesnt matter, you can use exchanges like Kraken or Coinbase (when its operational) you can buy btc or any other cryptocurrency and if you want to you can trade among the currencies themselves

0% chance, and think only 1% of coins were hacked the from Mt Gox and the rest were and I love this sentence : The rest of them were likely spirited away when "the system was fraudulently operated by an unknown party."
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:14:50
yes, perfectly.. thank you!
@_date: 2017-06-16 08:45:44
didnt even think about it... honestly, now I see what bitcoin community has been telling me for the last 3 years.. ups and downs are normal, dont sell..hodl.
and dont sweat about it..

I was reading up last few days about the whole incident, and honestly very little info can be found. Beside that sentence this video explained the whole situation in a best way possible :

You buy [ASIC miners]( and let them rip, if power is not an issue then great.. depends how serious you are the more info you ll need.. and the sidebar does help. gl
