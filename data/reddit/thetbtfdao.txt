Not really, at least not to decide hard fork or not.
Ethereum has a built-in deliberate defect called the "difficulty bomb" that forces it to hardfork this fall (the current branch will grind slowly to a halt).
So a soft fork to freeze the coins until then is basically equivalent to a hard fork.

What, you mean fixing that arithmetic error bug?
Cannot possibly see what that has to do with this.
Take your etherlobbying somewhere else.

Yes I know, and Ripple also sucks.
But **VCs still like managed coins like Ripple.**
VCs are idiots.  Idiots with huge bags of cash, unfortunately.

Son, the VCs who invested in the Etheruniverse don't give a shit about reddit.

No, ownership is not supposed to be dictated by consensus.  That's called communism son.
People fling that word "consensus" around far too often.  The only thing (intended to be) subject to consensus is tie-breaking double spend attempts.

The VCs who invested in Ripple disagree -- it's essentially a continuously-hardforking coin.
And frankly, they like these "managed coins" a lot better.

Hint: you need to use BTC to buy "gyft credits" and use those to buy the walmart giftcard.
It has something to do with walmart insisting on the ability to "refund" (i.e. unilaterally cancel) their gift cards.  That's why you can't buy them directly with BTC, no bulletproof way to refund the payment.  If walmart throws a hissyfit you might wind up with a bunch of "gyft card credits" which you can just use on amazon.
