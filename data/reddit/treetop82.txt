I debated this in my head very violently for 5 minutes.
Drugs and Bitcoin are different in that drugs have a high demand, all the time. Bitcoin doesn't have a demand if it's not needed. Bitcoin is not addicting and doesn't get you high. It simply allows you to send transactions quickly throughout the world.

I agree. Banning a future technology because you are scared of it puts your country behind. Instead, it would be wise if the U.S. harnessed Bitcoin's potential.
The U.S. may attempt to "ban" Bitcoin, then give the rights to VISA to run a similar cryptocurrency.
However, the special interests are going to start rearing their heads. The scare tactics are coming out...terrorism, money laundering, etc. Everytime Bitcoin gets a black eye, it's a perfect opportunity for the powerful to pounce.
If politicians wanted, they could push the media into spreading the "evils" of Bitcoin. However, this would lose in the long run  as the US dollar continues to tank, banks continue to be government controlled and regulation chokes off the entrepreneurial spirit of the U.S.

If you use Bitcoin in the manner that Op has, then you aren't speculating on the price of BTC. BTC's price is irrelevant.
If you are speculating on the price of BTC, either by mining it and or purchasing it and holding for a long time, then BTC price matters.
Bitcoin's use as a payment method is becoming more valid. This purchase Op outlined my be similar to loading funds into your bank account, however there is NO bank involved. There are no transaction fees, no logs, nobody you have to answer to, no debt, no charge back, etc.

@_date: 2014-01-28 07:39:20
There are so many lies in this I don't know where to start. 
Yes, BTC does not have an intrinsic value, but I think the blockchain does. BTC is about to turn modern day economics on it's head. This is a massive paradigm shift in the way money moves about the world. I do not think an experienced professor can even begin to understand this new technology.
The value in BTC is the ability to be transacted across the globe in under 30 minutes, away from banks, regulation and excessive fees. There is no other technology that allows you to do this. What else can you trade across the globe in 30 minutes besides a credit card purchase to a porn site in Romania?
BTC can drop to zero, there is no doubt. But that means EVERYONE stops using it. And the only way BTC goes to zero is if the encryption is hacked.

In a real messed up way, I think U.S. "regulation" of Bitcoin will be a good thing. Hear me out.
The government is sadly mistaken when they think that regulating Bitcoin will prevent illicit activity, Bitcoin cannot be regulated in the way they think. Why? Because of peer-2-peer transactions! In the past, when the government wants to put it's watchful eye in between two people transacting, they regulated the banks. In Bitcoin's case, this won't stop anyone from transacting.
Government regulation will only do two major things:
1. Track BTC/USD withdrawals.
2. Monitor  for tax purposes.
But as government moves to offer out "BitLicenses" and other such measures, they are cementing the legitimacy of businesses dealing in Bitcoin. This will lead to more exchanges operating without fear of being shut down for violating some obscure Fincen rule. The other result of government regulating Bitcoin is their ability to collect taxes.
The regulation itself is bad, however the idea of being regulated is good, at least for Bitcoin businesses/exchanges.

Bitcoin is going down, maybe back into the $200 range. BUT, does that mean that BTC is "gone"? Hell fucking no. It won't go away. Bitcoin is a parasite to the old school currency systems that exist today. It will never kill it's host, but it will thrive along side it.
Even if the price tanks, and the hash rate decreases, somebody out there will still hash. Eventually it will come bounding back, but I warn you that it may sit in the lower price range for a while
Deal with it temporarily, profit long term. The more BTC you have now is the more you can save for the future.

A few things must happen, 
I think once we can fit a bitcoin transaction device into our physical wallets (like a credit card), that businesses can accept, then we'll see it go main stream.
The price won't go up based on usage and transactions alone. People need to start buying bitcoin for investment, and a store of value. Only time and trust will prove to investors that Bitcoin is here to stay. 
Using Bitcoin is totally independent of its price. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 21:09:09
I don't get what you are saying. 
If BTC is expensive, then you send a fraction of it. If BTC is cheap, then you send several bitcoin. It still sends. 
I do agree if the price goes to 0 then nobody will mine it and it won't transact. But transactions do not make the price go up, people buying and holding on to BTC will increase the price. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:44:24
Idiotic thinking, you can't deal with the price stability. 
People do care about Bitcoin. People care about its usage, it's public ledger, it's ability to hop borders and evade needless regulation. Governments will never control it the way they want. It's a global currency.

_Supply and Demand / Free Market to the Rescue!_


Yes, because the ATMs are new and rare. The owners of such devices are in a market of their own. Nobody has risen to the occasion to challenge them. Wait until ATM machine at Starbucks charges %5 fee and the ATM built across the street now only charges 3%. The ATMs will have competition driving the price down. It will happen but just give it time.
Wait until IBM, Cisco, etc. get into making hardware POS systems/kiosks that these smaller companies have created? The price for a transaction will go down.
As such, as online exchanges continue to pop up they can compete through lowering transaction fees. Why do a lot of Americans not trade at BTC-E anymore? Because they charged a ridiculous price for withdrawals. 
Right now BTC is a novelty that is moving more mainstream everyday. You cannot push it by expecting a community to all of a sudden agree to cut their profits. You have to challenge them and drive the price down. Support the underdog start-up. 
Hell, this last year has been a CES Roadshow of BTC transaction hardware!


Sorry but this won't happen if it's not for profit. On one hand, I would suggest starting up a banking system where people can deposit BTC into a very secured storage, where that company would take the BTC offline into a cold storage. Or a company can facilitate the generation of an offline wallet for a customer, or something..

Don't forget that new bitcoins are still being mined. I hope to diversify my portfolio with some in the near future. 
Bitcoin has two totally separate uses. One is that the currency can be used to make international transactions. Second, it can be used as a storage of value. 
People should not assume when the news articles say "large Corp. Is now accepting bitcoins!" that the BTC price is going to go up. That sort of news has to do with transactions, not long term holding of bitcoin. A transaction is a mechanism that lasts a few minutes. BTC is simply the vehicle to do so, it goes from point A to B then back to cash. 
When you start to read articles about bitcoin ETFs and people buying BTC for the purpose of savings, then we can get a boner over the price going upward.

You need to watch the trends of a coin, do your research on the coin (is it worth a shit?) and then buy. If you see it's price spiking, probably no the best time to buy.
There are several alt coins I bought based on the fact I believed they have a good future (good web page, active development team, good name). And I've done very damn well.

Gold has a limit, it's whats in the ground. Gold isn't backed up by anything and is capped by how well we can discover/mine it. Bitcoin is capped by 21 million and how well we can discover/mine it.
Yes, I know Bitcoin can go to 0 in price. Bitcoin is not used in electronics manufacturing, or expensive jewelry but it is de-centralized (unlike any other currency), uncontrolled by any one entity, allows transaction in minutes across any border without any control. That's its inherent value.
I love the part where he talks about people not paying their taxes, or feeding the greater good. I believe the author's real problem is with this issue. He feels that if everyone starts using Bitcoin, nobody is going to pave the roads or feed the government its billions of dollars per month. Makes me lol a bit.

Unless they choose to not reveal expenditures due to "National Secuirty".

(this will be downvoted)
I agree that this isn't good news. They are allowing BTC to be traded, but not allowing BTC to be used by businesses to sell products? The inherent value in BTC is the ability for it to be traded for goods and services. It appears China wants to put a stop to that.
Not only that, but the words "money laundering" appears 17 times.

Our government takes from the not poor, to give to the poor, to encourage them to stay poor.

I agree, but until there are more ATMs competing against one another then the service fee will probably be high.
Good news is that this is seemingly unregulated, thus allowing the service charges to not be set by a government and regulated by the market forces alone.

So Bitcoin is trying to pop Litecoin's bubble?

I'm sure it's only the beginning, yay for big, over reaching corrupt government. 
I'm sure someone at DHS will get a promotion for this attack. 
And it doesn't surprise me DHS has no comment on the matter, they don't want anyone to see what they're doing. Homeland Security? Laugh.

Why would anyone mine or buy a currency that is just going to be spent aimlessly by large governments?
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:06:27
I would like an explanation of this, it sounds interesting. With exchanges getting DDOS, etc. it would be a good idea to decentralized the exchange process as well. 
Imagine if buying and selling BTC was done on a local client on your PC. The communication would take a Napster like approach.

No doubt it's the government trying to cut off U.S. dollar to Bitcoin, there is no other way for them to stop it.

Cryptsy has worked with me and fixed every one of my support tickets. Most of my issues come from placing or cancelling orders.
If you are depositing large sums to any site, I would make sure you save logs, transaction ids, etc.
But overall their support has been pretty damn good.

Bitcoin's intrinsic value is that is can be traded immediately, through the Internet, without banks.
Gold can't.

IMO Bitcoin is still very risky, however it is spreading like wildfire across the globe.
Especially with the U.S.'s latest near implosion of the market, Bitcoin stands as the digital "gold", if you will. As more and more people start accepting the currency, the risk of investing in it goes down.
Countries are now seriously looking to back Bitcoin in an attempt to circumvent the U.S. dollar, and if it keeps going at that rate Bitcoin price could go to the moon.
The smart approach would be to keep some money in Bitcoin, some in gold, some in silver, some in mutual funds.. i.e. diversify.

If you aren't using THEIR system, you are disrupting the process, according to them.

Well, if LTC goes down, you mine some other scrypt currency and turn it into BTC... scrypt isn't going away.

This line cracks me up, "...but the central bank is still looking forward for best practices for consumer protection."
CONSUMER PROTECTION is the guise they will use to deploy their schemes.

Amen, there will always be a way to get Bitcoin to fiat. Either through Euro, Canada, etc. This may just add one more step to the process.

Exactly, the article makes no mention of the divisibility of BTC. You can spend and or buy a very small amount of the coin. Whereas, if a penny was required to buy a brand new car, a lot of people would be unable to obtain a simple penny.

Agree. If Bitcoin starts to change in a way that negatively impacts the ideals surrounding its inception, then people will choose alt coins that promise not to.
Alt coins are just as viable as BTC, just not as popular. Some have stupid names, some have 1000 trillion coins, etc. I'd say there are 4-5 that are legitimate to grow into the mainstream eventually.

Someone like me is new to Bitcoin. 
Actually, I am waiting for this bubble to pop to buy in. And of course, finding a reasonable way to do so. 
If you have a field of people like me, waiting to jump in, then we help define the bottom.
