LOL and it's all fake!
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:13:13
We should revisit this exchange.
@_date: 2019-03-22 20:12:56
Good call lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:55:08
People use gold and oil. We need more of it. People don’t use bitcoin though. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 22:24:59
No it's like saying halfway through 2018 BMW switched everything up so no parts are compatible between the first half of the year and the second half, and then not getting it when people say "oh shit, maybe this company has idiots in charge"
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:07:36
I remember people telling me 9/11 was an inside job. You can always find idiots on Reddit. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 06:18:55
Not at all. 
ELI5 - you want to buy weed but you also can’t buy it at school. You tell your dealer you’ll leave money under a rock by the playground. You don’t need to leave your wallet there and hope he takes the right amount out - you only leave the right amount. So it’s more like a gift card - after you spend it, it doesn’t matter who gets it, there is no money to spend.

Is he a HODLer?
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:29:16
Studies have proven it dude, you can't argue with the facts.
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:48:50
Just google "[your bank] virtual credit card", or use the search function from your CC website. I just searched on Citi and they make it really easy. I think Chase and Amex do too.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:13:22
This is why I don’t own bitcoin. That and it is a fucking pain in the ass to buy and store safely. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:14:06
It'd have to go up to nearly $50,000 for something like that to happen. I doubt it.
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:31:35
This split is reiterating how garbage crypto is compared to fiat. They fact that any coin and be trashed like this by a small number of people scares people so they sell. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 09:11:53
Wow that is such a great use case for crypto. Such a gigantic need in the market!
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:23:43
Between the 2014 low and now the price is up about 10x. For someone to be like on of those poor souls who sold then, they'd need to sell now and then have bitcoin go to $50k.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:12:07


The corollary to that is people will trade and lose money REGARDLESS of the price.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:32:34
Rightfully so, but what makes you think that?
@_date: 2018-11-21 19:18:38
Dude you can’t be serious. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:11:23
All in on NUGT.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:05:24
Not to mention you can make virtual credit cards from most credit card websites that are good for a set number of transactions, $, or until a period of time if you don’t want to give out your real info. Super nice actually. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 17:57:21
I find it extremely valuable. I don't trust random ecommerce websites.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:12:51
-15% &gt; -65%
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:07:50
We should hang out more.
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:08:23
Well said. The only reason to buy crypto is FOMO. it has negative underlying value. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:06:20




Same goes with fiat.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:57:12
I wouldn't call them related.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:39:43
Bring on the correction :) I have a 40 year investment horizon. IDGAF what happens in the next decade.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:39:54
No - if the market CONTINUES to go down, it's great. You can lose infinite money if you short. Whereas if you go long, you can only possibly lose what you put in.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:13:25
Shorting is the easiest way to be left naked, and it happens fast.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:41:41
His distant ancestors being confederates is meaningless. If you've been in the US that long, it's not unlikely, and has nothing to do with the guy today.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:10:07
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:26:10
This being Bitcoin, the top 1 person has more than the bottom 4.5 billion.
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:11:13
It’s bitcoin, no one gives a shit about tech we all want to get rich. And so bitcoin will never hit 20k again cause everyone is selling at 10. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:10:06
If the US collapses your bitcoin won't be worth shit cause it'll be stuck on a useless hunk of metal now that there is no electricity. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:09:47
It’s what they say. Timing the market bears time in the market. Full disclosure: I’ve been banned from and @_date: 2018-12-11 05:46:34
Troll duh. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:13:18


If the price goes up they cannot any longer buy enough bitcoins to cover. They'd be insolvent.
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:38:55


Exactly. Bitcoin has no value. It shouldn’t. It’s gambling on a gambling ticket. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 05:45:57
Backed by the us govt...
@_date: 2018-12-11 02:14:42
No they keep their money in bitcoin because they want a bubble. I get it. But to say it can’t be touched by the government is the most ignorant thing possible. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:24:31
I want to buy some BTC, but it all seems like such an incredible amount of work. I don't trust any of these fuckers, so I'd need to keep a paper wallet. Just saying.
