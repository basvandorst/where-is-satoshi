"Of course, it’s no surprise that confidence in the crypto-currency has been crumbling. First of all, unless you were laundering money, dodging taxes or selling drugs, it never really made much sense to use bitcoin as a medium of exchange"
Again somebody who just hears something, and only knows to write the bad things people do with it. Sir, please stay away from Bitcoin and let us build something beautifull.

People dont need 1 Bitcoin to buy a product or sell a product. You can also buy parts of Bitcoin. If you want to buy a bread you don't need to buy 1 Bitcoin for around 500$ just to pay your bread with.
Everybody can own Bitcoin or a piece of Bitcoin.

Without saying names, from where do you have this information?

Have to buy my gf some flowers...
I have been bad at trading before losing few K's in seconds at one point. That felt like a kick in the stomage. My gf said Hodl from now on. Last night again I came to point I wanted to sell everything, and buy back in when its lower. She said better don't... but prices went down down down guess who I blamed :) (sorry baby) this morning I woke up and was happy to see I did not sell. So keep on Hodling for now! I am a believer in BTC and LTC but it gives me some panic moment tho.

This is what I think of China when they scream 'Ban' again

Most of the time when you divorce, you end up loosing half of your money. Then its best for BTC to go down now, and rise after you kicked her out the door.
For sponsoring you, maybe best for you to start a topic at the Dogecoin forum :D they are throwing away tips.

Nicely done, also that crash of Gox :]
@_date: 2014-04-09 10:51:25
Wow, I have been waiting for something like this.
But can somebody with more knowledge about security, check this one out and tell me(us) if its also safe to use?
I now use bitaddress.org and Liteaddress.org for my cold storrage, but want some more, so this could be a really helpfull.
Thanks already :]

Somebody screams BAN, prices drop, somebody screams Bug prices drop, somebody writes a bad fake news article prices drop, when I buy prices drop...... and so on.
On the other hand, more and more bussinesses start excepting BTC, more Bitcoin ATM's getting placed around the world, more people come to know about it, and get interested. More mothers are getting talked into buying BTC by there son. When I sell prices go up. 
Tell your mom to just hodl, its going to be all good have faith.

I joined Reddit, because of Bitcoin

I dont have something against somebody who is trying to promote his website or product, it could help him and also us.
What I do not like are scammers posting here to  others.

Nice idea, have fun meeting people and succes with your sells.
Maybe you should make a printout with: What is Bitcoin?

For sure your getting loads of questions from people that are interested in bitcoin. Good Luck!
