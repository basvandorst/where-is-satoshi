Nice username.  How do you remember that?
@_date: 2019-07-26 10:29:54
What is lntip?
@_date: 2019-07-15 06:08:32
It's cheaper again? Buying more. Not selling myself
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:47:02
that subreddit is full of wannabes. Try instead of.
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:48:26
So drinking beer makes you an alcoholic?
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:52:53
True. Netsec has 145k subscribers and Hacking only 80k. If this would be posted to both of them, you easily get a lot of people commenting.
@_date: 2015-12-20 19:13:43
It's up.
@_date: 2015-12-20 18:46:25
They wrote him that he can still withdraw his bitcoins, but not have an account with them. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:12:43
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:04:50
So why fuck changetip?
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:01:08
Same here. Good thing I didn't have a penny there :)
@_date: 2014-05-10 10:50:29
So... how many bits is there in a bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:43:18
He just lost 1998 bitcoins to mtgox.... the man is being offered hope of actually receiving his well earned coins back :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:37:42
Jaysus! someone tipped 9.5 bitcoins. But to whom and why?
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:22:48
tip 1 penny :P @_date: 2014-06-30 21:30:25
Thanks! Hope those bits will some day land me as a millionaire as I don't plan on selling any *bit* of them.
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:14:26
UPDATE: Just donated quite a bit of bits (oh the puns) for the lad himself. Please join if you can. I know most of you lads have more bitcoins than me.
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:07:31
Just go ahead and give him that 2 dollars, I'm pretty sure it will make him extremely happy or even help him with his crucial pain :)

@_date: 2014-06-30 21:42:43
Thanks! This 20 cent might actually be worth loads more when this mysterious auction results are out :))
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:07:33
Someone is handing out dollars for people to join this subreddit? Really?! 
I didn't get a penny when I joined :( *sigh* /s
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:36:08
That you :) I will treasure this tip forever with my other bits :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:36:13
True. It only took me ages to turn my wifes head into buying and keeping bitcoins. If the markets go steadily up by the end of this week, I might have a chance of buying more coins at some point :)
@_date: 2014-03-01 05:39:11
Maybe they should ask Karpales for some advice how to lose even those, as he is an expert on it.
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:13:16

@_date: 2014-07-01 11:34:47
Me owning 0.08 bitcoins... use them wisely :)

Same to you mate :)
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:33:06
500 bits are therefore maybe worth cent or two? 
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:32:27

"submitted 5 hours ago" now. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:41:36
I have him already tagged as an asshole bitcoiner due to some reason. Not sure why though :)
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:21:02
It was supposed to be a sarcastic funny comment :) 
Ah well, damage done. So who's funding that sort of advertisement?
@_date: 2014-05-10 13:54:41

Same here. Just got almost 10 dollars now transferred to changetip, so I'm going to help this guy out and make his day, even though I'm not rich. Today him, tomorrow me :)

@_date: 2014-06-30 21:46:06
Damn. I might just tag you as a future bitcoin millionaire if you can donate someone 1000 bits without blinking an eye :)
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:34:56
I know right. This lad I purchased my bits (coins, millis, whatever) was really nice and had almost 700 positive transactions behind him. It was also extremely simple to buy from those guys and use their website.
10/10 would use again :)
@_date: 2015-01-20 01:05:19
I don't get it why people hate small bit tips since they are still money after all. See us all at @_date: 2015-01-16 14:32:50
Just donate via or with your magic internet monies.
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:16:01
5 dollars for some article? Remind me to post some articles on bitcoin to this subreddit :)
@_date: 2015-01-21 04:42:19
I'd tip the local causes by using changetip and Facebook instead of giving away money, since supports it now...
@_date: 2015-01-15 01:27:02
Only 1000 bits? Pfft. With only bits like that to share, mint doesn't need poor people like you :D /s
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:23:33
You're nuts, but thanks :)
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:30:04
...like bitcoin, I presume?
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:19:28
So if bitcoins are assets, why won't court never return the gained bitcoins to debtors, but instead sell them and then return the money to people?
@_date: 2015-01-16 14:28:39
Well, you just made 10 bits via ... so never say ever.
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:19:39
have 1 bit @_date: 2015-01-17 10:25:55
That's only because you charged more coins there. You are currently standing at 53,633.41 bits.
@_date: 2015-01-01 11:43:49
This was the exact reason.
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:29:25
5 dollars in changetip? That's the most genours i've seen so far!
@_date: 2015-01-17 00:22:13
Are you seriously sending 100 usd to this troll? 
@_date: 2015-01-17 01:14:34
Maybe it gave up on one of the stupidest ideas. This thread will close soon as you only have 26,733.41 BITS left in your wallet and none of it is thrown at me.

@_date: 2016-01-14 10:14:50
Why did you thought it would be a great idea to only use changetip as money transfer service? There are tons of alternatives out there and changetip is not such a service.

Mate, they got 150k of your money in an account standing. Time to lawyer up at this point. Do post to @_date: 2015-07-03 11:55:11
If bitcoin wants to grow larger, we need a bigger audience and some people in germany, spain and nordic countries don't simply trust websites that are not translated to their own native language(s). I do understand that leaving the website in plain english is still a better solution than making a mess of the terms and vocabulary used.
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:35:05

@_date: 2016-02-04 19:50:46
you used a bug to get 400 usd extra cash and now say they took your money back? What did you expect after that tweet?
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:41:00
As a language provider i agree, but some of the clients really don't want to pay for TEP service (translation, editing,proofreading) service. Also, all these new "localization" websites don't use native or professional translators.
TL;DR you can't get proper stuff for pennies.

@_date: 2015-04-20 21:51:40
Naah. He just bought some drugs and didn't mistakenly send any bitcoins anywhere. They just scammed him out of his money and he won't be going to the cops... 
@_date: 2015-04-20 21:43:24
OP ()knows that already - 
He tried to buy drugs from EVO and lost all his money and now tries to get help from this community as he is a drug dealer.

Well, considering I was to drop 400 last week into bitcoin but only ended up putting 20 bucks, I'm still on the business :)
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:39:51
Fair enough. It seems I'm out of luck as I wouldn't want to lose too much on the trade. I guess I'll just go through the groups and see if anyone is interested in buying or selling. I even got some messages telling me not to invest my "laptop money" as I might lose it, but tbh, I would never invest more than I can afford to lose. Thanks for all your great help :) 500 bits @_date: 2015-11-03 23:30:17
Jokes on you. I only own few quid worth of bitcoins as I'm too poor to invest on it :)

There was a section on the video that was from the latest run they had with the locals up in Melilla. I also saw a video that is at least 4 years old, where the block lads are pestering a girl on the street, as I remembered seeing that in Reddit. 
EDIT: Also this part of the video is from one of the old videos showing some of the African immigrants trying to get to UK from France through the port tunnel at 1:50 part. Those guys have been there for years already and got nothing to do with the current problem.
@_date: 2015-11-13 00:26:32
Most of the material is NOT even from the last 3 years, but there is also material from Spanish controlled sections in Africa. The whole video is just full of hatred and bigotry.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:09:27
It doesn't basically matter, since I never invest more than I can handle.

Well, they are using it now: 
@_date: 2015-10-26 20:41:31
Aldi is the same everywhere, I live in Ireland, but I know that they have the same concept in the states. Good food for great value. As for their electronics etc. it's the same as Lidl - cheaply produced crap for cheap prices.
@_date: 2015-10-26 23:06:02

@_date: 2015-02-02 03:51:56
True. Never thought about it like that. What do you think Changetip should do to change the situation?
@_date: 2015-02-02 03:54:34
No, come and join as you'll see. We held draws, competitions and ask silly questions. Most of the bits bleed out to people who just like the idea of getting free bits and by doing this, we get more and more people excited about bitcoins. 
Currently changetip has no fees, so why not?
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:32:48
Today's your lucky day. Me and the lads at love bitcoing to *bit* (pun intended) and accept even the smallest tips. Hell, we even give away bits to each other daily. If you have too much of those precious coins, just hand them over our way - we won't be spitting into 10 dollars tips, nor to 100 bit tips. 
@_date: 2015-03-30 16:34:33
I think I was actually the first one that started using that moniker and actually held a competition earlier on where I gave away asspennies. Looks like someone got one of them and started using the same moniker :)
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:42:13
3 hour old post with 212 comments. Madness. How can they even give you money as they don't make any themselves?

Pfft. I lost 2 bitcoins when i bought myself a new computer and didn't transfer the bitcoins (as i didn't know how to do that). At that point the value of them was only few dollars so i guess i didn't lose that much. Now i'm trying to mine more (just started yesterday) and i've racked up a total of ummmm...
 Namecoins	0.00417431	-	0.00417431	0.00014135
 
 Bitcoins	0.00028486	-	0.00028486	0.00007067
...No idea how much since i don't even know what i'm doing... 
so that leaves me to the point... that losing 0.4970 is a big deal... carry on...

It seems that you don't see the messages I've sent you. All of your websites are hacked by some dumb syrian hackers almost 2 weeks ago and you haven't fixed them up yet. Just like with websites, bitcoins are stolen daily from people who don't know about security. If I were you, I'd ask some help from the good people on this subreddit for securing your new coins as well as how to secure your websites.
EDIT: TL;DR - Magic Internet Money
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:26:09
Nothing much. Just checked his websites and noticed all of them are hacked by syrians, including his own nameservers. Sent him couple of messages when I noticed that his servers are a mess and basically anyone could get in. 
He just sent me a message saying his website guy is now on holidays so he has left everything to rot.
TL;DR OP doesn't know much about technology and he needs help in order to keep his bitcoins safe.

Well, see for yourself: 
Also, that is just one of his websites he uses to promote his videos/business. I won't be posting the other ones that have been compromised. Lads who hacked him used just a pretty simple injection script which could have been blocked easily.

This. I always tell my clients, friends and family to buy out all the closest domains when they're opening up a website. It doesn't cost that much and makes you more legitimate.

No worries. Just hoping you can secure your websites. Also, I beg you pay attention to the lads here in order to learn how to trade and secure bitcoins. As for the trading part, leave your bitcoins alone for the next 6 months at least to reap the benefits out of them.

~~Still have the computer. It's my "old" laptop. I've reintalled windows 7 to it for about 3 times by now and done factory reset once.~~
Forget it. I just remembered that i had it on my second laptop which i sold a year ago. Ah well, better luck next time :) I've now made few bitcoin pennies so hopefully the value of them goes up in few years time :)

I actually just tried to do something like that with the help of something called "bitminter" which basically does something which i have no idea of.

What the hell? Why would anyone make a system that's needs to be installed in separate layers.

They are just trying to inform the public of the horrific things that are happening in their own country by doing it the wrong way. They also like to brag and promote themselves. So i'd say they also do it for fun.
