Not an expert, but understanding how the blockchain works, wallets are populated by essentially looking at the history of transactions. If you had the history of the blockchain offline, you could technically transact between wallets that exist in that history. It's not live and doesn't have any confirmation, but you can craft and test that the transaction would work before taking it live.

You are going to get alot of these types of responses OP but I definitely agree that this shoukd be a worry. The sheer amount of attention bitcoin is getting right now at such a fragile stage. I believe in the core principles and benefits, and I want it to succeeded, and I know that if we have a serious crash with this much attention on it, it's going to sour the taste of it to the mainstream public, which like it or not, we need the main stream public to accept it if we want it to truly be what we have all foreseen. I'm not trying to throw fud around, or say anything bad about bitcoin, but the cieclejerk has to stop for a second to consider real possible issues.

The post is "hurrr durr why don't they go to the good sites" my response is that because they see the people who know more about it then themselves constantly shitting on the good sites. 
And honestly with how non-mainstream bitcoin still is there is a very thin line between the quality of the legit sites and the quality of the scam sites. Therefore people rely on testimonial to tell the difference
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:43:16
You realize this is the communities fault right? When you are new to whats going on, and trying to do research,  for every person telling you to use this good and trusted wallet, there is also people saying how bad it is. Now to the experienced we see that as them meaning they had a bad experience, or its not as good as others. But to people new to bitcoin what they see is that this wallet is mediocre at best because of all the bad reviews and stories. And let's be honest, when someone starts complaining about a wallet they complain hard. So the newcomers go for something with less bad reviews, which end up being the ones most people haven't used.

The point being is if all the people who had their bitcoin stored on mtgox had been told by someone more knowledgeable that it is safer to keep it in your own wallet, than that wouldn't have hapoened. Instead of berating people for not having the knowledge, you should be spreading it so they know how to properly do things. The more knowledge is available, the more people would be willing to adopt, the more valuable it becomes.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:03:48
Thank you for the response! Where would I go to check the balance with the public address? Im assuming some kind of blockchain monitoring site? 
Secondly, how exactly do you create a transaction to then sign? I've only ever sent/received through software wallets and exchanges, so I dont know much about actually creating txs and how that process works.
Follow up: Are there hardware wallets that you can do the signing on, if for example I dont have an offline computer? 
Lastly, if im understanding you correctly, every time you send from a wallet, you should then sweep it all to a new wallet? 
Thanks again for the info.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:41:48
What exactly does that mean to you? Shutting down exchanges based in those countries? Or shutting down access to exchanges for people in those countries, because the former is irrelevant as exchanges would just crop up other places, and the major traders would just use those. See torrenting sites as a great example. And the latter really isn't possible unless they somehow take control of the net, which at that point we have bigger things to worry about then where our investments are. While you can entertain this possibility, it's simply not feasible. The fact of the matter is, the whole point of cryptocurrencies is that they really can't be regulated or controlled because they don't rely on anyone person, entity or government.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:34:58
Well also because it's safer. Yes if you put 4k in a month ago it is much vetter, but with the volatility of bitcoin, if hypothetically it had crashed, you are out 4k as opposed to if you did little by little.
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:19:16
I guess you don't want your investment to increase in value? Or you don't want to help bitcoin see full adoption? Because scaring people away for "being ignorant" instead of helping them learn so they can be better versed helps no one. The more people who get into bitcoin, the more your coins are worth. You shpuld be encouraging it, and helping people do it securely
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:28:26
Again, I am myself still learning, but as far as I know there's no way to get a private key offline. There's not even a way to really get the private key again, just check to see if it is correct (by trying to pull it up in another wallet). If you truly want to be secure, your best bet is to just create a new paper wallet, make sure you copy it down correctly, make back ups, and then transfer everything to that new wallet. As far as I know, what you want to do is only really possible if you were usinng a hardware wallet from the get go.
There really any downside to moving it to a fresh wallet though (except the tx fee)

I'm comfused. I understand that breadwallet could potentially start following the segwit2x chain after the fork, but surely if you hold the private keys to your wallet you will still have your bitcoin no matter what breadwallet (or any wallet for that matter) does. Is this an ill informed understanding?
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:03:10
The problem with your analogy is that bitcoins equivalent of the Nasdaq is impossible to shut down. Because there is no one centralized place that bitcoin can trade. Even if somehow they shut down every single exchange, bitcoin can still be exchanged peer to peer. Bitcoin will be shut down the day the internet is shutdown. Actually thats not even true anymore with the whole satellite system thats happening.

Also, while Segwit is like I said just an update, it lays the groundwork for a lot of great things to bring to bitcoin, such as lightening network, which has the possibility to speed up transactions, and lower fees. So just an update, but a good and important one, which is why a lot of people are excited for it.

The activation tomorrow  (or today really for a lot of people) is of segwit, which is simply just an update. Segwit2x, which is the fork, is something different. They we're named the same in an attempt to confuse people into thinking they are the same or need each other. The fork of segwit2x will not happen until november. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:27:22
So everyone here is telling you correct information but not actually elaborating enough to help you learn anything. As someone who's relatively new to this, and can understand how confusing this all can be, I'll try to help. 
Let's start with the first thing that everyones saying:
"You don't own any bitcoin"
What this means: 
A bitcoin wallet is really the only way for you to own any amount of bitcoin. Unless your bitcoin is in a wallet that you control (ill get to how that works later) then technically you don't own any bitcoin. Right now your bitcoin is stored on coinbase, which while its attached to your account, it's technically under coinbases control. If coinbase shuts down you lose it, if you lose access to your account, you lose it etc. In order for you to actually own the bitcoin you have, it needs to be in a wallet controlled by you. Because of that it's never a good idea to keep your bitcoin on a marketplace for too long.
Which brings me to the next topic: 
A bitcoin wallet is the only way to store and control your bitcoin. A bitcoin wallet isnt something you actually posses, it's a virtual thing. It is stored in the blockchain (which in a less technical explanation is essentially the network of data that bitcoin revolves around). 
Instead, what controlling a wallet means is that you control the keys to access the wallet. What this boils down to on a basic level is 
1)a long string of letters and numbers (that starts with a number 1) which is your public key, basically you can view this as your account number, it's how you, or others, can send bitcoin to your wallet
2) Your private key. In a literal sense this is the actual data that is the wallet. This is how your wallet is identified in the blockchain among all the others. In a more practical sense, it is a string of 12-24 words that are assigned to your wallet that you use to get access to it. It is called the private key, because it must be kept private. Anyone who gets access to these 12-24 words has access to your wallet, and any bitcoin stored there in.
Different Types of wallets:
For general purposes there are basically 3 different types of wallets
Software, Hardware, and Paper
A Software wallet is some kind of program that gives you access to your wallet. An example is like the mobile apps Mycellium, or breadwallet, or things like bitcoin core on desktop. Software wallets can be easier to use, but have the downfall of being susceptible to hacking. The actual provider of the software wallet, and the device you use to access it can determine their security. Just like any wallet a software wallet can create you a new wallet (in the process itll give you both the private and public keys to the wallet) or give you the option of accessing a previously created wallet. You would of course do this by using the private key (the 12-24 string of words we discussed earlier) attached to whatever wallet youd like to access. Because of their ease of access, but relative lack of security, software wallets are better for conducting transactions, but not so much for storing large amounts of bitcoin.
Next we have hardware wallets. This is essentially a device that saves the access information of your wallet onto it. While these are also good for conducting transactions, the information is stored offline (in the actual wallet) therefore they add alot of security a software wallet does not have. The top names in hardware wallets, as mentioned here are ones like Trezior, or ledger among others. Also, while not necessarily as safe, or easy to use as an actual hardware wallet, simply storing your private key in a file on an exterior hard drive or usb has the same effect.
The last general type of wallet, the paper wallet, is by far the safest type of wallet you can have. Like we previously said, all a wallet really is, is a private key (string of words) that accesses the information attached to it. This is why a paper wallet is the safest, because it is the most basic form, it is literally a piece of paper with you private key on it. It is the safest from hackers and malware, because it is not stored on an electronic device. The only way people can get access to your wallet with a paper wallet is to actually see the paper with your key on it. A paper wallet is made by using a wallet generator like bitcoin core, and saving the keys for the wallet that way. While a paper wallet is the safest way to store your bitcoin, obviously there is no way to send bitcoin from a paper wallet, and so youd have to access the wallet through another channel when you want to actually send bitcoin somewhere. But if your goal is to store alot of bitcoin for a long time, a paper wallet is a good bet. Bitcoin can also be sent to a paper wallet, as long as you have the public key (that long string of letters and numbers starting with a 1).
No matter what kind of wallet you choose to store your bitcoin, the biggest thing to remember is that without that private key, you essentially dont have access, so you always want to remember to back it up. Paper wallets, while safe are subject to damage from fire, water, or even being lost. So keeping the information stored in a few places is usually a good idea. Even hardware wallets should be backed up as you may misplace or damage those as well, leading you to lose your bitcoin.
Obviously there are other topics and debates regarding wallets that could be gotten into such as using 2fA, HD wallets and others, but this is the general.
That's the basics that I've learned so far in regards to your question. Like i said im relatively new to this community, so if anyone else sees any incorrect info here please let me know, as i too am still learning. 
As for OP, my biggest piece of advice to you as you have way more bitcoin than im even close to having so far, is to get it off of coinbase as soon as possible. Not that coinbase is a bad site, but just as others have said, technically you don't own it yet. But the biggest thing to remember is to be safe, and secure. Feel free to ask any other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.

We get it people. We also support BTC over b2x but this is still something thats gonna happen get your heads out of the sand and prepare for it.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:40:09

If it were to get hacked, yes your info would be vulnerable, I'm sure a lot of people are wary of it for that reason. But we are talking about a company that has two main purposes. Trading bitcoin, and doing it securely. That's what they do, so there isnt a huge risk of hacking anymore than anywhere else that holds your identity (Like your bank, or employer, or the government)

Got to realize, every big jump like the one weve had this month, everytime bitcoin makes headlines, more and more new people get pulled in. For people like you and me, who have seen the drama and learned, there are ten more people who are brand new to this ride. When someone tells you "you can put your money in this thing it has down nothing but go up for years" and then it starts to drop a few hundred, that feels like a lot to them. Then there's those of us who have been around for this ride who barely bat an eye at a $1000 drop anymore (or just see it as a fire sale lol)

First off, the downvotes aren't because I disagree with your opinion, it's because you aren't contributing to the conversation because what you are saying is wrong. I'm one of the few people on here who still abides by reddittiquette.
The point here, is the 4% (which is what coinstar is, not the 8-10% you keep referencing) is a premium being paid to not have to go through a bank account. When we are discussing some of the fundamental reasons why bitcoin is preferred, not having to use a bank account to buy it is hugely beneficial. 
In addition to that, removing the need for a bank account also would improve the process significantly as there wouldnt be the ridiculous wait times needed for transfer to coinbase as is currently.

Hey OP. A few people giving you shit without actually explaining. Proof of keys is a concept based off of the fact that if you dont control your keys (i.e. you coin is sitting on an exchange) then you dont control your coin. The point of proof of keys is to move coin off an exchange where someone else controls it, to your own wallet that you have the keys to. Because your coin is already stored in a wallet you control, you've already beaten that step.

I just want to point out, a lot of people keep saying if you have a coinbase account, you have a GDAX account, and can move stuff over right away. While you do technically have a GDAX account, GDAX has higher identity verification standards, and even if you can buy on coinbase, that doesn't ensure you can use GDAX.

Every big exchange is both good and bad depending on who you talk to, when and in what context. "Coinbase has terrible customer service" yet is still the go to recommended one. I dont think anyone is outright worse than the others, all of them have their issues, just depends on what you are looking for, and what you are willing to put up with.

I'm not really sure what this has to do with my comment, but yeah I noticed there was quite a bit of disparity.

Sorry, I thought you were equating investing to gambling. We are in agreeance.

The idea is that bitcoin would have to become as popularly  used so that we don't have to look at it in terms of how many $ its worth, but instead we look at it at a direct value. The reason we talk about things in dollars is because that's the value that everyone currently understands. If BTC gets big enough, people would be able to equate it to value as opposed to dollar value.

What dip?
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:11:34
But this dip, and when it dips again buy that dip. And when it's skyrockets again laugh on your way to the moon.

So hypothetically, whatever comes out as the dominant chain, if they wholly just ignored the existence of the other change there wouldn't be much real loss would there? The loss would be the other coin that wasn't existing before the fork. Like I'm using bitcoin now and jusy ignore the 2x coin afyer the fork I wouldn't really lose any bitcoin,  just lose the 2xcoin, or vice versa?

Can we go a bit more in depth on the effects of not having replay protection and how that could lead to theft? When you say new users does that refer to wallets made after the fork? Or simply new, inexperienced users who don't know how to protect themselves?

Most alt-coin prices fluctuate in a trend following bitcoin. They aren't directly related though, so it's not for sure.

This is specifically the reason the saving has been so easy. When I've put money away myself, I'm always tempted to spend it on things that I dont really need. When I put money into bitcoin, it basically leaves my mind as something that I can spend.

I'm still confused on the theft outcome here. I think I understand the possibility if losing your coins (trying to send both to an address that only can hold one?) Bit how does this lead to theft?

Less to go around. So to maintain same income youd need to up your hashpower

I only just now noticed that it had dropped. So...yeah pretty much

Hodled during the correction? You mean bought the dip right?
