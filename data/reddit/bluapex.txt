It's not the case with bitcoin right now, but it use to also be an appropriate payment replacement. Why pay Visa 2.5% when bitcoin is cheaper, and faster? Smaller cryptocurrencies have stepped up on this front with instant, feeless, decentralized, secure, scalable, solutions. There is real application of your money working directly for you.

Right, but he never invested in internet stocks. If he put literally any money on a single surviving company he would have seen ridiculous returns.  Never investing in new things doesnt make him a prophet. It makes him stubborn. Anyone can look at something that's gone up 1000% and say "that could go down". Even today his top stocks are in Kraft which has seen negative returns over the past year.

It's a correction.  Bitcoin is barely useable right now even with its namesake. People are flocking to stable coins that are proven to work like ripple and raiblocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:11:38
No. It's is the same minetime for each block... but each block will have more transactions inside of it. It's better for transactions but slightly worse for miners.

Youre talking about setting them up with their own wallets? With such short notice I don't think there is anything you can buy and store on a wallet for them. The only currency that has that ease and functionality is Raiblocks with their web wallet. But even with that, the only way to buy it currently is with bitcoin.  I'm doing the same thing for my family, but I already own my raiblocks on a hardware wallet. If you really want to do this, I might be able to help you out. If I were you, i wouldn't trust someone randomly on the internet but I don't see any other way with such short time.
       
Bitcoin won't work, transfers take 8+ hours and the fee is 20+ dollars.     
       
The reason I reccomend Raiblocks is because its near instant and always without fees, and they have a webwallet which sets up instantly and easily:

Most use bitcoin as a median to invest in other crypto. We need something to be accepted as valuable in order to do that.  Like it or not, bitcoin, with its wide global acceptance, fufills this role more than anything else.
@_date: 2018-09-15 06:10:26
Eh? Got stronger?  People got more confident? I still remember transactions taking over a day and costing  45$ back then.  I don't care if it's lightning or we do  up the block sizes, that's not okay and could be fixed.  Hash rate attack or no.

Please understand that no one is ever sure about the price. Today's big dip does have a good chance to be the time to buy... but the trend could easily continue downward.

Okay I'm gonna hit and I'm going to hit hard.  You are the exact wrong person to be investing in bitcoin. 
You don't see this as a technology or a long term investment while you handle other things. You probably can't manage to lose the money you just put in. Even if it goes up.. you have bills and other debt which is already a high % interest that might match bitcoins future growth...

@_date: 2017-12-21 21:58:44
I would wait, could be the start of a trend. Early analysis from the line wizards say it will never go below 10k. 12-13k could happen. Either way, after this dip, the consensus is a huge spike.  Either try to play the game or buy and hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:11:34

4 months ago I bought my first full bitcoin. 4.5k. This number should sound familiar to a lot of people. This was the all time high for the month leading down to China FUD. I was scared. I put too much of my money into crypto. It went all the way down.... for months... down to 2.8k. I sold half my bitcoin at 3.3k, just to keep my sanity.  I kept holding the rest. Sure enough, China FUD ended and bitcoin went back to 4.3k I sold the second the ticker broke 4.3k. Long story short. If you don't have the guts to hold. Sell now no regrets. It can get bad. It has historically always paid off but who knows, this could be the time it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:11:03
No they wouldn't.  A temporary or small block size increase would fix everything.  This would anger a lot of stubborn people though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:16:13
How could they not? The DAG coins (raiblocks, IOTA) solve every problem bitcoin has faced and will ever face.  The thing is that people have faith in bitcoin right now, likely because of the upcoming forks and hopes that it might be able to become usable again soon.
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:55:46

It can change, sure, but is it the case now? No. Maybe you bcashers should petition these exchanges to accept a bch trading pair instead of wasting your time trolling this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:54:03
I'm hodling as well. Bitcoin is only a portion of my investment. I don't see bitcoin Cash taking over. It's really just as shitty as bitcoin when compared to the newer DAG cryptos (Raiblocks, Iota).  Right now the only value bitcoin has to me is it's ability to exchange for other crypto. (Most exchanges have no direct dollar deposits) Is that enough to carry it forward? I believe it is... for now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:05:40
Shits way too expensive right now. I assume you are sending that to bitgrail to buy raiblocks? You are literally losing 50 raiblocks to fees..  People here won't like me saying this but just use Eth. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:38:05
Right, so speeding up transactions is bad because there will just be more transactions. Understood. Is there a way to halt transactions completely so there would be no demand?

The big difference is that those are major crashes.  Is this a dip or a crash?  It's too early to tell. A lot of people are sitting back and watching. It's good to be careful, especially with this stuff.  Most are fairly confident it's over but it's very smart to hold back.

The crash a couple weeks ago was because bitcoin Cash was directly competing (and winning)  vs bitcoin by taking our miners and heading power. This is just a regular price correction not an attack
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:36:17
Except who regulates the federal reserve? Who regulates the Japanese yen where they print more money to buy their own debt?  If you look into these things, bitcoin is MUCH more regulated and real.

Lightning network still relies on mining... it just uses a 'borrow' system in order to put off the confirmation time until later. Basically exactly how credit cards work today.  Please, someone correct me, but it really doesn't solve scalability at all, just a gimmick for fast confirmations on the buyer side? Ultimately, if used enough, the lightning network could back up regular confirmations, clogging up the network even more?

Very lucky to you too!  No lucky inheritance for me though... I was a full diehard BCH believer. I signed up to Kraken solely to buy BCH and ETC. Koreans were pumping really hard that night and suddenly it crashed on Bithumb. I saw the crash on the Korean exchanges and could barely get my sell order in on time on Kraken. Is it the last we will see of BCH? Maybe... 
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:01:52
 Okayn this is purely coincidental I'm sure, just recognizing a pattern:Huge hacks lead to big dips recently.  The korea exchange hack... 17k -》13k.. the 20 million dollar NEM  hack 14k-&gt;12k. Now this 17million dollar NANO hack.

It's risky.  Even more risky than usual.  The chances of catching the end of a bear market is much more exact and risky than randomly jumping into a bull market at any point in the way up.  There is no way I'm going to recommend anyone I know to invest now.

.5 btc each 3:10 am est on kraken. Next day bought back some BCH for .33 btc on kraken. That was a bad trade haha.

 You might be right, no one can say for certain but here is my 2 cents on recent events:     
So China only had 15% of the market share.  This is very different from the past where China had sometimes over 80%...      
There is just only so much that all this Chinese news can realistically affect. The question is:do you think the damage has been done or is yet to come? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:20:52
Yeah, we'll see. Could have the opposite effect of Chinese investors buying up btc  before the exchanges close..

It's a meme my friend

The uncertainty cleared up from the market. We know for a fact that China is out...     
Only good news can come from China now... They have already declared they are out, now it's time to move on

Some advice. If you are stressing about it more than it's worth, and you really aren't sure what to do... go ahead and sell some of it. Give yourself the over/under on if you think it's worth it and sell that % of it that you own.  It might not be the correct decision in the long run, but it will make you feel much better about it knowing you're not as committed.

20k end of day. At least.

Buying ICOs are purely speculative. Not 1 ICO has provided ANY dividends or funds back to the token holder. Selling your ICO bags onto someone else is not a true or reliable ROI.

They have been around since 2015 ripping on bitcoin the whole time? Man I WISH I even knew enough about bitcoin to rip on it back then.

No more uncertainty. People feeling confident knowing for sure exactly where China stands as of now. Most people knew today's was a big day knowing that the other 2 Chinese exchanges needed to make announcements by noon EST

8ks still a good price 
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:03:08
Yeah, kraken is a hella backwater exchange, shit still 404's. Do you really not know that BCH hit over .5 BTC at one point in early November?  I don't want to log back into that account but I can screencap it for you if you need proof or something? I didn't think it was that big of news because the day after people were talking about getting .53XX bitcoin per BCH...
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:00:10
It's sad that this sentiment is completely lost on 90% of investors right now... 
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:28:59
Sounds like you already made up your mind to sell. I'll get downvoted here but I'll tell you straight up: there is a good chance you are making the right move. Of course people here will tell you to hold onto it, and most of them are earnest. But they are the same ones who thought that $18,000 was "undervalued". The simple fact is that we're coming down hard off and all time high. The trend is way more likely to continue rather than reverse. You already said you are stressing about it, do what will make you feel better. That's all that matters in the end. Btw, you might have to pay a tax the year after you sell it depending on where you live. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:52:11
But it's not being banned... This is kind of a big misconception as China is just wanting stricter regulation on exchanges so that it won't cause economic instability.  The last thing Chinese officials want is to hurt bitcoin and investors, but they want to be protected from it hurting them (and their political position) even more.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:52:36
What are you talking about? You just said a certain thing and said that there is still uncertainty. We know all of that. China is officially out. If you think China had a bigger impact than just the 15% they owned then go ahead and sell.    
     
If China wants back in then they can get it, but as of now there is nothing worse China can do to the market.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:39:29

Want me to screencap it when I go to lunch? I mean, I saw threads here the next day about better rates than .5. 
 
Also: it was way above .3 btc for almost 5 hours... It's hard for me to believe you never saw a better rate. Maybe it's because I was using Kraken?

Little late to jump in on ICOs.. not a single token is yet to provide worth back to its holder save exchange token... The ico bubble hurt bitcoin worse than anything.

They are 2 different things.  You seem to use them interchangeably. If you sent BCH to BCH wallet you are fine.  BTC to BTC wallet you are fine.   
It sounds like you might've sent BTC to a BCH wallet.  In which case you are not fine.

If you're a bad trader then that's that. If you don't think of it as a long-term investment then you will likely always lose. Selling only during a down and buying only during an up is a surefire way to lose money.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:02:35
You have a right to your opinion, and most of your post is your opinion. The thing that isnt your opinion, and what you're factually wrong about, is the ATH of BCH in 2017 (which is why I only replied to that). If you really want to confirm it, without believing me, look at posts on r/bitcoin on 11/12/2017. You will find comments stating higher % than just .5. If you super cared, go to r/kraken, and see if a support guy can confrim my trade. If you don't care to do either of these things... then what's the point of even talking about it?

If it helps: you're a trader, not a HODLr. Do your job with your investment and follow a TA group at the very least. To not have seen this crash coming means you're blind. I'll hit you up with this group who I follow. They called "Bitcoin 3k" 3 weeks ago. I laughed when I read it but still protected myself. I still can't believe it... and the trend could continue... here's who I follow:

TIL missing out on a 10% gain is "being gutted". Did you make money? If so, then your trade wasn't bad.  Hold back a few days. FOMO is strong.. but time to sobre up now... reinvest with a clear mind. The fact that people who panic sold on the first crash are still doing better than us now should tell you something... something I didn't see once all last year.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:06:57
Kraken is my current mainstay. The hardest parts are the verification and getting use to the interface. But much lower fees and instant transactions blow coinbase out of the water. Oh, depositing funds requires a wire.. not as convenient but deposits are very fast.

You understand the majority of these are exchanges hot and cold wallets? This just means that more people are depositing their bitcoins to exchanges in order to sell them
