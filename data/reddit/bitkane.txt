The island is zoned A4 (which is forest reserve land) but can be re-zoned. Im not talking about 100 ppl moving in and on all at once, but a 10 year planned build out of the island. And as far as giving anyone bitcoin it would be done with a multi-sig address or through a funding-full platform like bnktothefuture or lighthouse. The ownership could be transferred bought/sold as easily as a btc. 
This is preliminary question to see if there is serious interest. If you can't see the benefit of an all bitcoin island in Canada and the potential of such an endeavor than I doubt you can see the potential of bitcoin. This would be a live test in Distributed property on the blockchain.

Exactly. In the short term this is a very viable solution while a long-term plan is created.

If 10 millionaires want to put 250,000 into this - so be it. 
The cost and timing of the rezoning is relatively inexpensive ($10,000) and take up to a year.

Yes, there is a small care-takers cabin already on the island. It will take probably another $1,000,000 to get a community boat, dock, solar, water and electricity infrastructure. And I love exercise! It keeps me healthy.

We are using Ledger HW.1's (hardware secure modules) in a sealed federated array.  There are multiple chips that can sign multiple txs/sec.  
Cancoin employees do not have access to users private keys because CC encrypts everything in your browser and does not store user data, including keys. Keys are derived from your mnemonic and never touch our servers. 
We look forward to supporting Trezor and Ledger offline signing later this year.     
We currently use a 2 of 3 multisig wallet in our p2p exchange escrow to control disputes and limit fraud.
The big difference between GreenAddress and us will be our p2p exchange and the way we sign txs using our HW.1 server structure.
Cancoin would like to acknowledge the quality service, security and respect for privacy from companies like Coinkite and GreenAddress and that we have been keen users and admirer's of their software.  
Our wallet is very secure. Simply back-up your mnemonic and you're good to go.

Thanks for asking. 
Cancoin has created it's own federated signing array using Ledger HW.1 HSM's which do all the signing in a secure environment. I think Coinkite uses a more traditional bank like server. 
Cancoin is also a dedicated p2p exchange with that technology coming later this year  
Cancoin is also free for anyone holding more than 5 btc whereas coinkite has a $9/month service charge. 
This is from our FAQ page: 
- "If an unforeseen event were to cause Cancoin servers to stop signing transactions, we would release our private key via a third party service. Because we generate our keys with strict BIP protocols, you could then use the two keys (yours + Cancoins released private key) to move your Bitcoins to another wallet service or cold wallet. 
Hope that helps

This is a custom Cancoin.co solution using Ledger chips. Custom software, Ledger HW.1 hardware.

Www.cancoin.co is ready
@_date: 2015-09-19 22:27:52
Don't forget   
Multisig (P2SH)
- One user controlled key and one Cancoin controlled key to sign txs
- User controlled key never exists on Cancoin servers
- Txs signed on Ledger HW.1 Hardware Secure Modules
- Fully scalable infrastructure
Obelisk / BS
- Scalable and secure data transit
- Real time blockchain queries
Other security features:
- TOTP (time based one time passwords)
- BIP39 BIP44 compliant
- Memorable image on login (anti-phishing)
And finally our Key security features roadmap:
- Client side HSM signing integrations
- Native apps (mobile, desktop)
- Browser plugins
- Offline transaction signing
- Offline Seed / Wallet generation
As well as all this security we are a 100% bitcoin business.  We have bought all our hardware with bitcoin and use it to pay for as many aspects of the business as possible - we're still working to get our datacenter to accept it ;)
Soon to be opensourcing:
- A client for Libbitcoin Server
- A wrapper for Libbitcoin Explorer
- A HTTP Blockchain query server using Libbitcoin Server 
- A library for pooling Ledger hardware security modules
And in progress of: 
- A Elixir library for Bitcoin
- A Bitcoin HSM Server using Ledger hardware security modules
- A client for Bitcoin Core's yet to be merged ZeroMQ block and transaction publisher.
Of course the P2P marketplace exchange is also soon to launch with hopefully iOS, Android native app by summer 2016.  All through working 2 jobs and loving life, and bitcoin.

Useless means you can't use it or it's hard to use. this is the easiest thing i've ever done and it works great. I'll pay the fees for a year and hope things improve. That's their plan.

Ive been using  all over town. People are amazed I'm paying with my phone, then I say I'm paying with Bitcoin, and they are mindblown.

Can people please not make this a habit? Besides looking like this is shot in a showroom, bragging about cars (unless it's a lambo joke) is lame a f. Everyone holding bitcoin is going to be wealthier than those who arn't - but be humble.
