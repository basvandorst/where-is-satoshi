Why would the businesses invest in capital goods when the demand for their products goes down as people keep stuffing their mattresses? Conversely, why would spending on consumer goods be the only alternative to mattress-stuffing? A smart person would invest the money instead, thus directly providing resources to the economy, and getting dividends in return.

Why would governments break their own settlement systems, and more importantly, why would they choose to use one in which 90% of the tokens are owned by random neckbeards wanting to get rich quick?

Because money itself is worthless, only production of goods and services matters. By investing in the stock market you are reallocating resources to enable this production to continue and grow. By stuffing money in a mattress/buying gold/buying bitcoin you're just gambling on the future value of money/gold/bitcoin, which is economically useless.

Bitcoin is not money, and your gains are theoretical until you cash out.
$ in -&gt; Bitcoin -&gt; product   does not help because when bitcoin crashes, you will get way less of the product.
