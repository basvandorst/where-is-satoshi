We are forced to read between the lines because you are not telling the whole truth. By honouring just one USD withdrawal you are arguably stealing money out of the other creditors who had their accounts hacked. Implying (again because you won't say) that they are therefore responsible for the funds in their *segregated wallet*.  
Now decorate that all you want with "we are trying our best in our investigation" &amp; "we promise to try and help recover the lost funds" but may I now quote your own Ts&amp;Cs:  
[*You are solely responsible for any and all trading and non-trading activity on and for your account on the Site. You acknowledge and agree: to be fully responsible and liable for your trading and non-trading actions and inactions on the Site and **all gains and losses sustained from your use of the Site, BitGo**, and any of the Services; to be responsible for any negative balance in your account(s) on the Site*](
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:35:08
Simple: 
[No USD was stolen in the hack, so yes, you would be able to verify and withdraw the USD in your account.](

No, Bitfinex is insolvent which means it makes no difference whose coins the attacker has, everyone's going to take a hair cut once the lawyers start carving up the company's assets.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:01:49
There is a theoretical *bad thing* if someone thinks their funds are safe because they are not hacked only to find out later that they are going to take a hair cut when the business is liquidated.
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:36:41
PGP told me personally last night that the haircut will be more than 63%.  
Bitfinex need to come out swinging and they need to let the community help them build real peer-to-peer functionality in their product so that it helps the whole industry define new security standards. And not just this hand waving crap they just say to shutup the CFTC. We all know it's not really a p2p exchange but if they're too arrogant to accept help like they have before then nobody will ever trade there again and they will just fade away and their magic tokens with them.

I am not as technical as you and but [would hosting the binaries on IPFS or Bittorrent]( which use the cryptographic hash as the URL, be helpful? This way the core devs just need to sign a plain text file which has the maglink or the IPFS hash and it's easier for people downloading to see they are getting the correct file.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:54:36
The way it could come across to some people who are desperate though is that you are implying their funds are safe. That's how it comes across anyway to some of us on Whalepool. I think it's safer to say nothing until official announcement in case people read too much in to it.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:30:23
Yes you are right, since Finex is at fault they would have to buy the coins back.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:40:25
I mean just move on in terms of those coins in the hacker's wallets. There are blockchain analysts who will have alerts setup if they ever do move. I just mean in terms of where we direct our focus for remedy needs to be more towards engaging with BitFinex directors. At the moment they are making decisions behind the scenes when they should be including the community. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:22:24
Zane's working very hard and as a friend and Bitfinex user I am going to help him out a bit here for clarity. Your question was:  
**What about *holders* of other currencies?**   
Zane only refered to the currencies that were not stolen. But to be clear just because those other currencies weren't stolen does not mean that the *holders* won't be taking a haircut. This is because if Bitfinex is insolvent the business could be wound down, assets sold and liquidator will be in control of how much creditors get back. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:35:05
I know you're just the messenger man, I really do and I'm sorry. But I have to report the truth. That means asking hard questions which might go against your business interests. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:13:42
Stop playing games. Stop making posts here, you are a liability to your company. It makes no difference, ALL Bitfinex Customers are liable to take a hair cut, all this semantic word games of whose coins got taken is a side show and you are giving people false hope who held USD etc.  
Just stop.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:33:58
Be aware that has clarified just because you will be able to 'verify and withdraw *the* USD', the word 'the' in this case does not mean ALL of your USD. You may be liable and take losses due to the hack: 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:00:59
Yes this is exactly the point. As well knows when he said:  
[No USD was stolen in the hack, so yes, you would be able to verify and withdraw the USD in your account.](  
He's been creating this confusion all day. At some point he must realise that after all these people keep making the same confusion, maybe the problem is with him and his communication and not everybody else.  
Basically, no socialised losses. 'Your Bitfinex Wallet was your property and your responsibility, we will see what we can do.' cc @_date: 2016-08-04 00:50:16
You're playing semantics to give yourself wiggle room later on in case you need to change your position legally.  
Bitfinex is the custodian of all the funds on its site. It does not matter which ones got hacked, it's fine to mention it in passing by way of expanding on the details, but that's not what you have done.  
Instead you have placed it at the top of the status page: "Bitcoin users had their funds stolen."  
Not Ethereum holders, not USD holders. You have been telling them they are fine in direct messages on this site. You even told one USD holder he could make a withdrawal. But wait...
The hack was your fault. Bitcoin users couldn't protect their funds, they didn't hold one of the private keys. They didn't even get an email to confirm the withdrawal. As a business you are now insolvent due to a $60m liability you most likely cannot fill.  
That means someone has to step in and take over the business. Someone impartial who can review all the stakeholder's arguments. By allowing withdrawals to go ahead you are isolating the losses to those Bitcoin Accounts as if the whole business itself didn't suffer the loss of the funds in its custody.  
A court could very reasonably rule that everyone should take a haircut and not just Bitcoin users who had 'their funds' hacked. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:07:30
I am not the only person confused, which is why I feel safe pursuing this issue. I am not deliberately trying to annoy you.  
You answered the question when you said you would honour USD withdrawals. You are isolating the losses to hacked account holders which will create a dispute since you will not be able to pay your debts as they fall due, making the business insolvent. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:15:12
Good suggestion.

Also the BXC dividends, if it works at all, won't be paying anything significant. Bitfinex doesn't do that much volume, we did calculations in Teamspeak over the last few days. Even assuming they get back the volume they have had in the last year it will take them 5 years to recoup these losses. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  
Dividends are likely to be very small to the point of insignificant. The best the industry can hope for is new investment in to a industry changing security product like you mention in point 7. But it's a really long shot.
@_date: 2016-08-09 04:02:43
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:24:49
Not unless they can stump up $60m to cover the losses and who wants to ever deposit on their exchange again? So they can't recover the costs through future earnings either.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:10:39
Dude, massive respect, you have been up all night and you're still answering questions. I have to say that I have noticed you saying that USD, ETC, LTC funds are safe but the truth is Bitfinex is most likely insolvent right now. And what that means is that people's funds, in whatever denomination are liable for a haircut. We cannot preempt what a liquidator is likely to rule, whether they sell off all the assets of the company and distribute them across all creditors or if they stick to the CFTC ruling and keep the funds segregated.  
I would say you should add this caveat to these customers holding USD when it comes up unless you have information I don't know.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:01:00
Flibbr spoke to Giancarlo who is Bitfinex's Risk Manager, he also hangs out with us on the Whalepool Teamspeak Chatroom.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:32:10
Yeah. It's hard to imagine there hasn't been some big negligence, possibly BitGo too, for allowing such a large amount of money to be signed off in the first place.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:17:14
Well they kind of have and they haven't. I think they are in a bit of denial and that somehow they are going to get the coins back, either by rebooting the businesses or catching the theif. In any case they are insolvent as of now and so it's a matter of the creditors to seek representation and stop Bitfinex from trading further, like giving out USD withdrawals.  
I am sure lots of clever legal gymnastics by will work in the short term, claiming that users were responsible for their own segregated wallets: 'it's just a p2p market and we are the match makers' but law is more complicated than that and there will be those who will claim they had no such control over their wallets, they relied 100% on Finex for access to those funds and since this was Finex' fault the whole business should be sold and divided up between all creditors regardless of what tokens they held.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:18:02
I don't work for Finex but as a friend I am trying to help with his comms. Finex have been unclear from the start about whether losses will be socialised and in an effort to keep the comms channels open in good faith they are in fact creating confusion and false hope for some users. I clarified here:
Sometimes Zane intimates that some users are affected while others not. Then other times he makes clear they have not decided what will finally happen.  
Truth is if insolvent then everyone is liable to take a haircut. cc @_date: 2016-08-04 23:10:05
That hasn't been made clear yet.

I hope you're right. I will ask PGP if he eventually comes on to Teamspeak.
@_date: 2016-08-08 22:39:04
He didn't say much of anything. I keep repeating myself here but is pretty much useless. For someone who talks so much he says absolutely nothing. At times he goes in to specifics only to back on himself and say "that's not what I said".  
The only way you are going to get real answers is by going to the people who really matter within the company, the decision makers. He's just been contained and is trying to maintain the impression that they are still open for business and responsive. But he won't help you get to the truth.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:33:01
It's fruitless engaging with He means well to try and give the impression the lights are still on and they are communicating with their customers but all he's doing is creating more confusion and getting in to arguments with customers who are understandably distressed.  
We need to go above his pay grade, I have emailed PGP and Giancarlo and offered to help them. Right now their brand is being torn apart and [turned in to memes]( They stand zero chance of coming back from this unless PGP comes out on to the lawn and faces the music, even if that's a really really hard thing to do.

Blacklisting is highly controversial in the industry but for your own edification I believe this is an exhaustive list of addresses unless someone can correct me:  
In all likelyhood the hack will not move the funds, maybe not for 5 or even 10 years from now. There is no way they would risk giving information away about themselves.  
It's also possible they took a short position on other exchanges and have already made their exit. They may also have been ideologically motivated and simply hacked BitFinex's wallet and its technology just to make a point.  
Imo it's a waste of time trying to get the coins back, they're gone. Move on.
@_date: 2016-08-05 07:57:40
That sounds more like a revenue figure rather than profit. I had heard it was something like $50m revenue per year. But yes, they need to be transparent about this too.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:20:40
The short answer is because when you lend the USD out on Margin the borrower used it to buy BTC. If that BTC was hacked then they won't have enough funds to buy it back at market price to make the lender whole.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:17:57
Well that's a great argument thank-you, I did ask earlier but didn't get an explanation. However I am pretty sure those clever lawyers are going to have fun in court fighting this out as they argue over what **Bitcoin is**.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:25:17
Oh man, allow me, it's on your own [status page](  
*We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that _some of our users_ have had __their bitcoins__ stolen. We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been affected by the breach.*  
You see the wording? Is english your first language? Can you understand how that comes across as an aspiring Community Manager/PR Rep? You did not say:  
*Bitfinex has been hacked, 119k Bitcoins have been stolen and we are investigating.*  
You keep referring to segregated user accounts. But this hack was, by your own admission Bitfinex's fault. No users had any ability to save their funds at any time without relying on Bitfinex's site. If you are not careful someone is going to file an injunction to prevent you from allowing withdrawals. 
Either speak the whole truth or say nothing at all, you are making things worse.  
cc @_date: 2016-08-03 16:47:03
What difference does it make? Every time you say this you send the signal that people who had their bitcoin accounts hacked are going to be treated differently to those who didn't.  
If this is the case could you please state it clearly. I mean either let's wait until the official announcement or don't say anything at all. Because if it turns out Bitfinex liquidates you're going to have given people false hope.
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:54:08
I spoke to their CSO Phil Potter and he told me that 63% haircut was wrong. It would be higher. 80% is just a non random guess based on the estimates others have been putting forward.  
It would be good if BitGo could take some responsibility but it doesn;t look like it: 
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:59:35
Certainly no harm in Finex publishing an address but I cannot help but get the feeling that if this is what they are thinking they are in denial. No attacker is going to do anything to compromise his identity. Any contact with Finex or anyone, even moving the coins will reveal information.
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:19:11
The real question everyone wants to know is: how much is the company worth? So that we can ask: how much of a haircut am I going to take?  
People don't want to be dealing with legal letters 4 years from now facing 40c on the dollar.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:01:52
thanks for all your hard work on this. Can you tell me, how much does Finex make on fees on average per day? Let's say on a good day.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:40:27
So either you're not insolvent or you have taken a legal view on how you are going to deal with creditors claims in any Insolvency Petition. Because as I said, even if LTC, ETC are safe that doesn't mean that customers holding those funds are safe. For you to go back online so quickly to give customers clarity on their funds sounds very curious to me. Can you say how you are able to do this? $60m is a lot of money, I am guessing PGP doesn't have that lying around down the back of a sofa.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:54:43
Imo they should have had stops in place but apparently the hacker was able to lift those limits. Not much use in having those limits if they can just be removed. There is going to be plenty of contribution towards this hack to go around.

@_date: 2016-08-06 13:08:00
Given the magnitude of the losses it would be:  
...withold *80%* of everyone's funds until such time...
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:57:23
I would say the probability of that is low, certainly possible, maybe he just wanted to make a point? But history doesn't back it up so I'm not going to waist CPU cycles on hopium. No hacked exchange has ever recovered the funds as far as I know.

Hi, I am the co-founder of ProTip. You are correct and we did ask the Darkwallet team for help with Stealth addresses when we first started coding but apparently they have now gone stealth and are not responding emails or developing their extension! :/
I am very active in this community and of course am staying up to date with the BIPs and I am also looking at Dash as a possible alternative in the interim.  
Your point is well taken. My belief at this time is that we should not let imperfections in the tech prevent us from building free open source software like ProTip but we do have to strike the right balance with not leading users in to bad opsec. If the app were more popular we would be at risk of doing that, at the moment I can make videos and write documentation to help users understand the risks.

I applaud the OP for bringing some balance and clarity to this situation. Disclosure I have some funds on MtGox which represent a small amount of my BTC holdings, which if I lost would have a limited impact on my life. I am mostly concerned about the wider implications this incident is having on Bitcoin ecosystem.
**Claim 1a:**
I am of the view that MtGox needs an independent audit by an external body such as the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA) in order to bring closure for the customers of the service
**Claim 1b:**
This is because customers have a reasonable expectation to the accessing of their funds and we have moved well beyond a reasonable time frame.
See definition of Cash flow Insolvency "Cash flow insolvency involves a lack of liquidity to pay debts as they fall due."
**Claim 2:**
This would bring much needed transparency to a company who has proved themselves ineffective at communicating.
NB Please dispute this claim only if you can provide evidence to the contrary.
**Claim 3a:**
The Github logs (last made 9/10 days ago) don't really show active engagement by Mark Karpeles but just comments from the sidelines.
What concrete steps are being made by MtGox to resolve this issue both technically and communicatively? 
Please provide evidence because Bitcoin is a fast paced environment and other exchanges had this issue resolved within 72 hours.
Indeed is there any evidence that MtGox has anyone working for them other than Mark and the mods in the IRC channel? Because if they don’t then the best way to have this issue resolved is to publicly identify the work that needs to be done so that we can draw on the large pool of resources that the wider community has to offer.
**Claim 4a: response to "Nobody really knows..." by OP**
MtGox’s priority should be to tell the truth in full and tell it urgently to those who need it. There is no such thing as non-communication. Everything you do communicates something even if you don't say anything at all. The one thing we are sure of is that we don't know much at all which falls on to a backdrop of what we do know from the past namely:
History has shown given sufficient opportunity and incentives human beings will often fall for temptations in the market place to commit acts of fraud and manipulation.
Contrast MtGox price chart to BTCe and Bitstamp. Some have speculated (rightly or wrongly) that there is market manipulation by insiders possibly in an attempt to recapitalise balance sheets. Whether the speculation is justified is not as important as recognising the speculation is being made and loudly and that it is having negative impact on perceptions by the public.
History has shown people will often commit crimes if they believe they can get away with them which leads to obfuscation and the economic handling of the truth to meet their own needs.
Therefore based on the balance of probabilities and in the interests of radical transparency, on which the Bitcoin system was built, there needs to be an urgent and full disclosure of the facts.
Justice delayed is justice denied. The longer this goes on unresolved the more uncertainty and unhelpful speculation will occur. This is a big distraction from the real heroes in this story such as the Coinpunk project charities like Crypt0Youth and what’s going on in Cyprus right now.
This is a theft of people’s time and attention. I really hope MtGox has this issue resolved promptly and that I will look back on this post embarrassed at myself and that I spoke too soon.
Please, I look forward to your refutations and challenges. Thank-you.

[As discussed]( it looks like a hit job and much of it is miss framed and sound bites are out of context.
This is however the full episode which is even worse than the shorter version people outside of the UK have already seen. 
Fortunately I was there as the interview was taking place and do have a full copy of Peter Todd's interview on audio. I have reached out to the BBC to invite them to release their copy first.

Ah Gavin, my man. Here have 2 coffees We were just talking about you and how tricky it is to find your bitcoin address, which I must say is rather ironic given your position ; )
But anyway serious point is I want to help lay people understand the underlying philosophy and technical aspects of Bitcoin. The processes used to make decisions by the developers and the kind of work that goes in should be more accessible to people that don't have a technical background.
This is our new subreddit One goal is to inspire new developers to get involved, maybe some kids will want to become coders if they can see the impact they can have. 
Also I think it's important to create an [Endowment Effect]( among the users of Bitcoin to give them a sense of ownership of project. If you don't understand something you don't really own it. Also it's not right that people tend to take coders for granted just because they work off in the distance.
What do you think?

You can and I used to do that but when I heard Armory on LTB interview I was like "hell yeah, I like this" and I wanted to support a fully featured Bitcoin client that was open source. But I am a geek and I can incorporate this and running a full node in to my identity.
I am also enjoying playing around with the multisig with friends, just setting up random "Block chain weddings" by getting people's raw public keys and making lockboxes for them and then sending them coins for the fun of it.

I like Armory because I can run it offline on an old Linux box and then have the Watch Only public keys on my main laptop and watch my donations come in from the show. I get a warm fuzzy feeling knowing that my coins are safe b/c of the air gap security.
Also I like running a full node because I believe in the Bitcoin project and want to support it.

Ok I have made some minor updates to your work. Well done this should be it in its final form: 
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:30:06
I've said it before but there needs to be an open source version of ChangeTip that works as a browser plugin.  
Users can front load it with small amount of funds and say what types of artists they want to tip. The app will then monitor webpages and automatically tip Bitcoin addresses that it finds which match the criteria.  
It should be open source and audited to reassure the public that no data is being collected.  
We could also host a community effort to tip the developers for the code and help to support artists online who are currently underpaid. They will have a vested interest in promoting the product for us. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 12:30:39
Hey this is helpful. But at the moment these are just random numbers. We need to consolidate them with other data points.  
To start you can look when each address had its first transaction and plot that on a timeline.  
Now let's say we have a witness statement from staff member saying he was given instructions to send funds to address:
  
We put the witness statement on the timeline and we plot it against the first known transaction coming in.  
Then as you go through the other addresses note of addresses like this one which comprise as part of multiple outputs:
  
There aren't many wallets that let you do this, so it was either done directly in the exchange software or it was done in Bitcoin QT or some other advanced wallet.  
Pay attention to the time of day and cross check it with any tweets from  Try to log everything in UTC time for synchronisation with other investigators.  
Once you have excluded the change addresses and you have a good idea of a narrowed down list (your one is pretty good as it is) go to:
  
Put the suspect Bitcoin addresses in to daily Google Alerts so that when any blog posts up the address you are notified. Also maybe put up an [ANN] thread on Bitcoin talk and tweet about it.  
Get interviews with the staff and ask them what they know. Record everything. Record the time and date and the people present. Store it safely. Then keep following the leads.  
I will keep working on this but good job, your post was really useful, thanks.
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:22:44
Thanks so much for asking such a good question.
I would love to see a plugin for Firefox/Chrome that automatically tips content makers and artists based on the web pages I spend most of my day reading.
How would it work?
The plugin would be a thin wallet. As a user I would top up my wallet and specify in advance how I want those funds to be distributed and over what time frame.
When I go to a webpage that has a crypto currency address on it (it could also be in metadata or as a script) the plugin detects the address and adds it to a list.
At the end of the day the plugin notifies the user of the articles that they spent most of their time viewing and asks them to confirm before sending an even distribution of funds to all of them.
For me it's important that for content providers to be paid the consumer has to commit in advance to paying. Even if it's only 1mBit per article, that's still going to add up over time.
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:24:27
We've been raising the same concerns on [WCN]( From ChangeTip's point of view they see their app as giving new people a free bitcoin address easily.  
Pantera Capital invested in them for "user acquisition". They already have  a large position in Bitcoin and so I think it's reasonable to speculate that they want its popularity and price to increase. 
They think they can achieve this by randomly spreading bitcoins across social networks using APIs instead of actual wallets.

[Charles Hoskinson and Mihai Alisie - Ethereum London Meetup February](
About 6:20 in Charles begins with the following pitch:


At Ethereum we say, we give you a *turing complete scripting language*, you know like python, like javascript. You can do pretty amazing magical things with those languages, right? What if we can combine that with a block chain and create this incredible foundation? And say your base unit is a contract with a turing complete system and it’s up to you to decide what features you want."
*Emphasis mine.*
He then goes on to say Ethereum is the Android of the Cryptp-Currency space and invites the audience to use their imagination. This argument rests on the turing completeness.
From on [Bitcoin Talk Forum Jan '14](


*Emphasis mine.*
I also recall the turning completeness being mentioned prominently at the beginning of most presentations in London including the one in Hoxton Bar with Gavin Wood who, as I recall, bragged about the '*Namecoin in 5 lines of code*'. There was more talk of this at the one at the Barclays Accelerator more recently where a similar analogy was used for Dropbox.
I am not passing judgement but I would say that is why the outside community latched on to it so much, it seemed to feature very early on in the pitch and may have led some to believe that this is what made Ethereum so powerful.
EDIT: Added link to Bitcointalk thread and clarified the point about Android analogy.

In the case of Coindesk they are still building their brand equity and site traffic so as stated here:  &lt;&lt; they are only putting interested parties in to sales pipeline at the moment.
The internet runs on the attention economy. Gotta turn those eyeballs in to $$$. And remember your time is non-refundable, once they taken it from you they can't pay it back.
Also there's such a thing as an [advertorial]( see if you can count the ratio of Dogecoin and Litecoin articles compared to other altcoins here: 
There was also this infamous article about the failed online wallet [inputs.io]( and the article has since been changed slightly and now has a question mark in the headline to make it sound less positive:

This was a controversial interview that BBC Click team did with Peter Todd and Amir Taaki last week in the Bitcoin Squat. It was [discussed at length]( here.
People asked me to release my copy of the audio which is poor quality because originally it was just for my personal notes. But I felt that the community should hear it in full so they can decide. There is a transcript here if the quality is a problem:
I am still adding to transcript but I have got most of it down.
EDIT: Link to original BBC piece: 
The full version of BBC Click is on BBC iPlayer UK only
@_date: 2014-09-23 15:52:57
But this time we have the evidence and we can hold it up and show people. In fact some people may want to dig through the transcript and defend Jen and the team and that perhaps these guys are "extreme libertarians".
I think though that devs like Amir and Peter just don't have the media training and that makes it easy for journos to entrap them in to giving sound bites that do not faithfully represent the whole truth. Because the whole truth is a journey that never ends.

@_date: 2016-01-06 10:36:01
Hi,  
I have tried to tackle this problem before and have a workaround. The other commenters are right that Google changes the file each time it is downloaded and so you won't be able to produce a stable zero knowledge proof. However what you can do is create a Torrent file and timestamp the maglink which is also a hash like this:  
  
You can also include a timestamp inside of the video itself by showing a screen grab of the latest block including its merkle root or just the block hash itself. This will prove that the video (unless edited) was shot no earlier than that block height. The resulting maglink hash will now be a pointer to the file that will itself contain proof of its origination. By timestamping the maglink you are locking in the video's creation in to a time window.  
Obviously videos can be edited so it will require some degree of visual comparison by users to verify a video has maintained its integrity. But on the horizon we can see things like [IPFS]( which will allow hashes to be used as URIs and as the need for this kind of verification in journalism increases you could see software that compares rich media files for evidence of tampering.  
Hope this helps.

We are working hard on a full contextualised transcript to help with that: 
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:52:16
I am Chris Ellis and I work at Bitfinex. **No coins have moved from any of the Bitfinex attacker's addresses since 27th January 2017** when we saw 196 Transactions spend ~876BTC out from the smallest receiving balances back in August.  
For a full list of the 2,072 transactions involved in the hack and the 196 transaction in January see my public Github [Bitfinex_Hacked_Coins.csv](  
The OP has a 1 month old account and is posting while Bitcoin is approaching its all time high which is sure to get clicks and comments. If you want accuracy though it's simple enough to download my csv files and put the addresses from the August hack in to a "watch only" Electrum wallet, then just wait and see when the coins really do move.  
**So far though only ~$794,000 USD worth of bitcoin have been withdrawn.**  
@_date: 2017-02-23 23:31:58
See my replies [here]( &amp; [here](  


This article contains inaccuracies for example:  


We cannot know that the entity who carried out the hack is in control of the private keys being used to continue the transfer of coins so the statement that "[the hacker has] continued moving a portion of their loot across the Bitcoin network" is not strictly true. If the hacker was smart they would have offloaded those coins on the darknet to a buyer without any trace back to them. And now you are just following a red herring without any idea of the identity behind the control of those private keys.   
Also the article has another error:  


There were 2072 addresses used in the August hack.  
The only thing I was playing down was the clickbaity headline which invited users to imagine the effect of $130,000,000 being dumped on the market. Since no new coins have moved from the original hack there is only 876BTC in circulation from the hack. I do not think it is unreasonable to label this kind of language as FUD. Nuance is key. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:27:51
I am [assuming you are acting in good faith]( The address you mention:  


That was one of the addresses on the 26 Jan 2017 that *received* coins from an address originally used by the Bitfinex hacker in August. This address can be found on this list: [20170127--Bitfinex_Hacked_Coins.csv](  
The coins I am talking about are the original ones used in the hack which can be found on this list [2072_Unauthorized_Transaction_Bitfinex_Aug_2016.csv](  
So this means that the coins at the 1J5fP2.. address are no longer controlled by the same private key used by the hacker in August 2016. Because of this we cannot assume that the hacker is in control of these coins any longer.  
For example he could have made a deposit on a service like  and used it as a mixer. E.g. made withdrawals later on using different amounts to the ones deposited and so now the coins you are following are in fact being controlled by an innocent user of Bustabit who just happened to withdraw the Bitfinex hacked coins. The ones you have been tracking could well in fact be in control by a different entity.  
There's nothing wrong with your enterprise of tracking the inputs and outputs as long as you keep all this in mind. I am only commenting on transactions moving from the original 2,072 transactions found in the [2072_Unauthorized_Transaction_Bitfinex_Aug_2016.csv]( list. 
Edited first line, I thought I was responding to the OP of the post. Too many messages in my inbox and I got confused. Hope I have cleared things up. Let me know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:14:32
I don't much respect or like the ideas suggest by OP. But I doubt the Australian cyber-crime agency will care.  
I don't remember what the terms of service said when I installed my Bitcoin software because I don't read terms of adhesion but I don't think it said that I had to only send transactions that were transfer of value. Maybe the term was implied but I didn't notice it. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:00:51
Have link to [csv file]( containing the latest data from the current batch. I will keep it updated with all relevant information as time goes on.
@_date: 2016-06-25 13:16:15
There's one point missing from that list which is user education. Running a full node is a great way to get your hands dirty and actually learn now the Bitcoin protocol works rather than just using a bubble gum UI to send and receive coins.  
Education is a decentralising force. For this reason I recommend people try compiling Bitcoin themselves and playing around with it, even if it's just a 'weekend warrior effort'.
@_date: 2017-01-27 14:06:08
Right now it looks like they are testing to see how different exchanges react to these initial small deposits. The exchanges themselves will have an internal record of what was transacted. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 12:28:06
This is the original list of addresses from the hack in [August 2016](  
The hacker transferred the coins in descending order of value. They are now moving the coins in ascending order (smallest first) to a variety of exchanges, some well known.  
As and when I have more details I will release them here. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 10:05:14
Hi, I work for Bitfinex and can confirm the following Bitcoins from the hack in August 2016 have been moved:

@_date: 2016-11-29 20:26:55
It looks like [Bitgo have made changes]( since the Finex hack. Most importantly they have removed the ability for users to remove the upper limit on Bitcoin withdrawals via the API. They have made it so that to make template changes like this you need more than one person at the company and using 2FA.  
Which sort of leaves me wondering why this wasn't in place before. I am also wondering if they are selling themselves to exchanges like OkCoin as a Security Company or as a Software Company. If anything goes wrong this time are they going to say: "Our software worked as designed and it's up to the users to implement secure parameters"?
@_date: 2017-01-27 13:58:29
So far they have only taken the smallest transactions and spread them out across a wide range of exchanges. This might suggest they are testing to see which ones will allow them to transact and which ones won't. So there isn't much to dump and I anticipate it will be quite slow to move that many coins associated with such a high profile theft.
@_date: 2016-12-05 12:27:25
I made my losses back by doubling down on BFX coin when they re-opened. Was really critical of them while it was going on, couldn't imagine them recovering and then they pulled a rabbit out of the hat.

This is very relevant. There's no downside to people putting their Bitcoin addresses on their websites, videos or Soundcloud. I've said it before but this is how you [win at the Internet]( The first link about Sushi was recognised by Protip, the second wasn't because it uses a third party to do the payments.  
Spread the word. The microtip tag used by at least 2 browser extensions so far is: &lt;meta name="microtip" content="1Bitcoin" data-currency="btc"&gt;
We have also told the Brave browser guys about it so hopefully they will integrate it too.

So this whole "censorship" issue was in fact a non-issue, a red herring designed to distract everyone from what was really important all along.

It's publication censorship/moderation. The word "censorship" is problematic because it brings up ideas of state censorship and old fashioned one-to-many broadcasting &amp; Publishing where being censored could have dire consequences for one's freedom.  
On the Internet being censored on one platform is hardly damaging to ones freedom given the distributed nature of the network.

@_date: 2015-04-09 14:59:40
I am Chris, I started the ProTip project. Your feedback is really helpful so thank you for that. I will just answer a few of your points.  
The first few paragraphs of the [Indiegogo Story]( outline the user experience are are trying build. It takes a prospect from freemium to premium through the following features:  
As an artist I copy/paste a bitcoin address on to my webpage/Youtube description giving me a Call To Action eg "If you want to support me please donate using, you can download ProTip App here..."  
As an audience member I download the app and top it up to help support my favourite artists (I saw this work work on my [Youtube Channel]( people will pay if they love what you do and are given a convenient opportunity, they just need an excuse.  Also see [Patreon](  
As a user I can top up the app and subscribe to my favourite artists and even unlock self hosted paywalls. Our design intent is not for everyone to start locking up their content with paywalls but that they will probably give away most of their work for free but give away only exclusive “behind the scenes” style extras to their most loyal fans.  
We expect to see the same kind of Pareto efficiency  as the gaming industry where 1-20% of the audience pay for most if not more than the production cost of the media.  
So it’s not just tipping. We actually want to build a culture of reward. We also want to help build an open web standard to make this common place. The code will be open sourced on 1st of May (we are implementing the wallet now). It is then free for anyone to fork and take the idea in a new direction if they feel they have capabilities we don’t. We also welcome collaboration.  
On the business model we consider ourselves a Not for Loss Organisation. We have ideas on charging an opt-out $0.25 subscription to the ProTip Development fund so that we will be paid the same amount as the artists and content producers on average. This only gets charged if you actually use the app and we can easily cap it at 10% of the total so you are never overcharged.  
Also if people are not able to self host for the paywall we could provide private hosting or a simple URL shortener for the paywall script and simply charge $0.04 per link.  
We would prefer to get feedback from the community first. We want to make the business sustainable but we didn’t see the point in limiting ourselves to Not For Profit as actually sometimes that can be a little bit deceptive. Many non profits simply pay their Directors more as a way of getting funds out of the organisation. We do not expect this kind of service to be massively profitable. Especially since it is open source and can be forked. The business model will soon drive to zero if we tried.  
First and foremost I am a journalist. I am building this because I need it myself. I will speak more in the future about how to plan to spread the message but you have identified a sticking point which is the lack of adoption of Bitcoin.  
Thanks again for your time on this I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-09-22 21:04:48
Yes I agree. And we need to raise more money to do this. Our bitcoin address is here:
  
We began with the browser that had the most reach. Each implementation will require more developer time for maintenance. Given the level of popularity we have received in the past few days Leo and I are tempted to run with another crowd fund specifically for the Firefox or similar feature aiming at a more modest target of a few thousand dollars.  
We would be delighted to have your support.

Hey Chris from Protip.
Yes I like Syndicoin but I think when I last spoke to the guy he said it's not all open source and there is some centralisation involved. But I do support any project that helps people raise money online this way and so perhaps there is some room for collaboration there. We are doing the same with @_date: 2015-09-29 19:56:12

Yeah it's surprising that it's not mentioned at all in the script. But I actually kind of liked the fact that bitcoin was understated in this piece, it's not so 'in your face' and I think for anyone coming across this video on youtube Bitcoin will just be there subliminally alongside Bittorrent and other p2p systems Rock illustrated.  
I think the focus on the human element was important rather than it being another bitcoin promo video.

Can't wait to find out how much he was paying himself.

Thanks for this info.

Exactly what [I think!]( Though if Bitcoin cannot stand up to such an obvious attack it probably doesn't deserve to survive. On the other hand if this passes with nobody really noticing then I think that validates bitcoin even more.

That sounds like a great idea. Maybe a bitcoin wallet baked in to the browser that could be "content aware" and then it could send auto payments to producers based on what you consume and a weekly allowance. Genius!

Can you link me to the issue, I have been testing Bitcoin on the Pis 2 and 3 and I might be able to replicate the problem my end.

ProTip predates the Autotip project. I first mentioned it back in [May 2014]( and it turns out the idea was first witnessed back in by here:  We started work on ProTip at Christmas and had been talking about it on our Youtube channel for a while.
The fact that many people are having the same idea is a good thing. What’s important now is that we build a culture of reward. 
We like what Chris has done with the meta tags in Autotip so we have put that in our schema too, building on top of the work rather than fragmenting.
This can only be a good thing for online artists, journalists and vloggers who don’t want to be forced to choose between competing products. ProTip only requires you to copy/paste a bitcoin address on the page which we hope will lead to more people adopting the trend.
We’re only asking for $10,000 to help support the project initially. If the community thinks we’re the right people to take this forward then we’re asking for $50,000 so that we can make this project sustainable.
Competition is good if you want incremental improvements but it’s collaboration that will bring about the big changes. That’s why these projects must be open source and sustainable long run.
Corrected the link to repo

I am Chris from ProTip and I wrote a [longer response]( above.  
We support AutoTip meta tags in our version and I would be happy to promote both products in tandem if it meant more people would benefit in the long run.

Thanks, corrected

Imogen released Tiny Human as a "pay what you want" model so if all you want to do is consume the content you are free to do so and of course tips are welcome. That's easier with apps like [ProTip]( (sorry shameless plug).  
If you want to modify and share her work you can do so via this app here:   
That one I think is in Ethereum.  
For more details she did a blog post where she talks more about her intentions:   
I think in a few weeks/months, they will gather all the feedback and see what happened and what can be improved.

Yeah it's just a PR piece.

Yeah it does take ages because the Pi isn't powerful enough to process all the scripts in the blocks like multisig. It takes over a month now from start to finish on a Pi 2. The Pi 3 is a bit quicker. I have to sync it on my PC first and then copy it over, then it usually keeps up. 
This is the Bitcoin Config file I recommend, feel free to take ideas from it if you want:

Thanks I posted your correction along with clarification on twitter 
@_date: 2015-10-02 19:43:28
Hmm this account seems to be being used to promote commercial services. As the co-founder at ProTip I am flattered for the link but we like organic growth please.  
If you like our work great, download the app. If not that's okay too.

There is always a lot of pressure on an alt coin to keep their brand "top of mind" in the press to keep the "eyeballs in attendance" (attention economy). It has also been known to help support a price of a falling asset but I am not saying that this is what's being done here.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:42:37
ummmm 
@_date: 2015-03-29 21:26:19
Thanks very much.

Or see my comment above, she also takes bitcoin.

I was on Whalepool and I personally support UASF and that's not exactly representative of what Phil said. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 03:13:37
Yeah what he meant was he coined the term "SPV" as in the abbreviation not the actual concept. And to his credit he was the first person to implement it with bitcoinj as part of his Google 20% time project. I was corrected on this myself   
But yeah clumsily written and a bit arrogant. Altogether the guy is dividing the community.
