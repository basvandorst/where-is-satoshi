Serious question:  
If we use worthless fiat paper to buy bitcoin... 
does that make bitcoin worthless? Bitcoin is backed by nothing as well
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:05:52
ALL BITCOIN IS BOUGHT WITH WORTHLESS FIAT...  
therefore, Bitcoin is worthless fiat?  
Seems like the fed could just print unlimited funny money and buy all the bitcoin.

Not the only coin with years of testing and credibility

There is no such thing as bad press.  
Streisand effect.  
Those things helped push BTC mainstream

This is a purposeful and malicious attack on BTC
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:35:44
Not what I was thinking
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:07:19
Yes there is one other coin out there with the longetivity and scalability

HOW is bitcoin a store of value?? Besides the hype in people's minds, there is zero logical sense.  
Electricity and a computer being turned on to 'create something' while people are gone doing other things does NOT have intrinsic value of any kind to people now or in the future.

gold is used by royalty and is in jewelry. It's shiny and nice, you can hold it in your hand. Gold is used by many industries, like electronics. There's a true limited supply until we can mine asteroids.

Serious question: with transfer times of 10 minutes and fees of $2-25 per transfer, how is bitcoin not the crypto that "friendster" was to social media?  
Is bitcoin just like a collector's item and therefore a store of value? I heard as long as people THINK it has value, then it does. But are these not going to become baseball cards?  
Seems like this is simply rich people speculating.
