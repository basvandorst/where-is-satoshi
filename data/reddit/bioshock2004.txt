I don't want to be forced into **ALWAYS** using mBTC, in which the OP suggests.  Bitcoin is all about freedom right?  IMO, we should just leave it as it is, and simply add the option to change between the units (and other SI units) at the user's discretion. This seems as if it would allow us to handle all drastic price inflations/deflatons that may occur in the future.  If we were to universally transition to mBTC, on a larger scale it would seem to marginally complicate things more.
 
  
I'm all for the metric system, American if that matters, and it makes sense to use mBTC when the price of an item is 0.002 BTC (2 mBTC), but not when the price of an item is 20 BTC (20,000 mBTC).  
 
  
We should use µBTC, mBTC, kBTC, etc., only when it is more convenient since BTC is the base unit  When using meters as the unit, you wouldn't say, "The store is 500,000 mm away from my house."  You would say, "The store is 500 m away from my house."  Therefore, it seems illogical to hear someone to say, "The car costs 10,000 mBTC" instead of "The car costs 10 BTC." 
 
  
Also in a hopefully, very unlikely scenario, BTC could fall below $500 per BTC, then we would have to switch back or be in the same predicament as we are now except using mBTC
 
  
Finally, please stop pegging BTC to USD.  Bitcoin is an amazing, global thing.  Everyone does not use US dollars or think that 1 mBTC should be equal to 1 USD.  
 
  
Add options for users to use whatever SI prefix he or she wants to use. Do NOT force everyone to use mBTC since it could possibly be counter-productive for large scale transactions. 
We should keep the base unit BTC, and use µBTC, mBTC, kBTC, etc., when it is more convenient.
