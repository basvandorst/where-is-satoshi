You will make about $5 a day. I have two of those cards.
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:51:59
Yeah pretty much.
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:33:18
60% of the time, it works all the time.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:15:50
Uphold and Bitstamp
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:23:53
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:39:18
OTC service
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:21:17
It's called structuring and it's illegal. Go look it up jackass
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:30:49
Also 
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:02:02
This. They're fast, had money in my bank the next day.

As a Hawaii resident?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:46:01
Bitwage maybe? Idk 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:05:37
You can buy from Uphold.com
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:39:55
I use it, it's legit. It's my go-to to cash out BTC ($10k daily limit). However, you can only deposit $500 daily limit. You can very easily exchange funds between foreign currencies as well as a few other cryptos like LTC, ETH, etc. So far I've had no issues with them.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:53:03
I use it and it's legit.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:25:29
Keep track of your transactions using a service like cointracking.info. At the end of the year you can run a tax report and import that into TurboTax
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:30:49
This. I recommend using Genesis trading next time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:26:43
tree fiddy
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:07:43
Ledger Nano S or Blue
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:37
It's from a game show called Press Your Luck
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:54:48
I tried both and currently use Cointracking.info. It has a ton more features that are useful for me. All i can say is try both and decide which one you like the most.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:09:54
Brah this IS the dip right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:26:46
Be patient, HODL
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:18:51
I wouldn't say that. At least I don't, that is.

@_date: 2017-12-13 10:48:02
Uphold and/or Bitstamp works.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:14:21

Sometime after Bitcoin Stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:24:14
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:21:52
Can you double-check? Bitcoin is supposed to be an option on that list.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:21:31
CoinTracking.info is another site, they also have an app
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:44:00
Thx watching right now!
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:03:45
Yes this is correct too, thank you. OP i suggest you read through this post regarding taxes: 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:30:38
This. I recommend using Genesis trading next time.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:34:35
are you asking if you HAVE to pay tax on this transaction or asking WHEN to pay the tax?
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:59:30
How many do YOU have? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:06:04
Dude the profits will be the same, there's no point in doing this lol. Damn 16yo scammer.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:05:46
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:00:47
Watched the Rise and Rise of Bitcoin and it sparked my interest, got in at $600-700
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:48:22
You about to get rekt
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:57:28
If you sold all your BTC before the BCH hard fork then you don't own any BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:39:16
He's right. I'm from the future.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:53:14
No, not until you sell your Bitcoin or cryptos for fiat. Theres no tax for buying and holding.
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:03:56
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:57:16
How close are YOU? :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:01:40
Many on this sub won't divulge this information, for security reasons. But if I had to guess, it would be about tree fiddy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:46:55
lol wtf? Source please
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:01:59
OTC with itbit, Genesis Trading, or Cumberland Mining is my guess
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:22:20
Ledger blue, $249 from Ledger website
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:04:37
This. I almost guarantee the lower the BTC price drops, the more us HODLers will buy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:18:54
I am also curious of the source that Ledger pulls from but i am unable to find this info. On r/ledgerwallet, the question has been asked many times but there's no relative answer as to where the price comes from.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:05:51
I'm not an expert or anything but I assume that the owner of the wallet from which the crypto was cashed out from is responsible for the taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:50:05
I use Uphold right now. I have a Bitstamp account but haven't used them yet. Uphold has a $10k/day withdrawl limt. Not sure about Bitstamp, wasn't able to find any information on limits.
edit: I also live in Hawaii
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:55:47
Haven't found any info yet. I see that Bitcoin Diamond futures are trading though.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:04:59
AFAIK, The most current guidance on IRS virtual currency is found in IRS Bulletin 2014-21
edit: fixed wrong bulletin #
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:10:38
Why the hell are you asking the internet? Go talk to a financial advisor.
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:39:54
Wex statement says they transferred BTC-e balances to Wex.nz
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:47:01
You got it backwards my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:13:10
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:46:54
Sources for Amazon and eBay claim?
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:50:30
The current tax bill allows for like-kind exchanges for crypto to crypto trades, but this rule no longer applies to crypto in the new bill. Nothing else changed.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:22:54
Cumberland mining?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:18:25
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:00:59
Or i can just encrypt my plaintext file and save me the hassle?
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:49:36
Sorry didn't read the whole thing... If he's going to give you the money to buy for him then you can use whatever exchange is available to you in your area.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:47:07
Uphold or Bitstamp. Really the only 2 choices for Hawaii residents at this time.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:14:41
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:20:42
Go home OP, you're drunk.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:32:23
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:54:11
Why would you announce this, idiot
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:55:09
Like I said, I use Uphold. Direct transfer to bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:28:46
I'm expecting the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:30:22
Yes, crypto to crypto trade is a taxable event
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:44:22
Make a record of your transactions using cointracking.info. It will do all the calculations and you can export a tax report.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:01:13
My decision was to sell some to recover my investment and leave the rest in. Reduces your risk.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:53
I have two of those cards and make only $6 a day mining Vertcoin
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:44:57
Where's da source mofo?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:07:35
LOL yes true, sorry im not good with words sometimes
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:39:44
This one looks good, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:06:00
It's Britney, betch.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:28:18
Good read: 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:21:22
It doesn't matter, your gains were realized the moment you sold them. It is irrelevant whether the proceeds from the sale are kept in your bank account or your exchange account, you still have a realized gain for tax purposes.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:01:08
keep the 5500 and put the rest of the 10k in BTC. or vice versa, whichever you are more comfortable with 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:34:07
Yeah, this sub has helped me a lot when i first got my nano s and blue.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:35
The dump.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:44:36
Cumberland mining or genesis
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:43:40
Cool story, bro.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:17:15
Tree fiddy hundred percent.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:25:52
No sorry I should have specified the fork date of Aug 1st. So you have BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:53:01
It's a Sony memory stick. You need a memory stick reader.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:53:35
Yes. I'll buy your BTC off you for $1 each since they won't be worth anything soon.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:02:13
Yeah where is this?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:22:28
No one knows and yes we are.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:39:46
I'll fork my own Bcash, with blackjack and hookers.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:10:44
Contact an OTC service like Genesis Trading or Cumberland Mining
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:06:43
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:47:00
He meant Tesla, y'all.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:22:07
I literally Google'd "bitcoin forks" and this was the first hit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:30:38
Don't worry guys, he's from the future.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:37:59
This. Take say 25% profit so at least you got something if Bitcoin were to drop to zero. Let the rest ride.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:37:49
lol k u get robbed then
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:14:11
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:48:58
Bitcoin.org is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:14:46
probably localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:06:42
I'll just go ahead and get this one out of the way, USS Satoshi Nakamoto
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:13:33
He followed it with "Even if i never converted btc to fiat" so i wasnt sure
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:30:32
This. I recommend using Genesis trading next time.
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:04:35
What are some of them? I know of itbit only.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:18:46
I use cointracking.info for this purpose
@_date: 2018-05-17 19:19:03
OTC perhaps
@_date: 2018-05-30 04:57:15
How about Mocha? Mocha Chino?

@_date: 2018-06-26 04:05:48
I live in HI and use Uphold.com
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:42:50
Where is this located in the food court? Or is it in Shirokiya?
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:07:08
Ah ok. I was confused when you said food court, I never considered that the village walk is literally a food court. I think everyone calls it the beer garden lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:05:18
The only alternatives i've found are Uphold and Bitstamp. I use Uphold and have no issues as a hawaii resident.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:47:44
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:55:03
I use Uphold to buy BTC, no issues for me as a Hawaii resident. Bitstamp is also another option.
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:43:07
I use Uphold, no issues for me (Hawaii resident). Another option is Bitstamp.
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:07:36
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:37:17
I haven't tried, I don't do high volume trading so I just enter each trade in manually. I would think they would be safe, just like any other api.
@_date: 2018-03-19 05:33:13
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:05:40
Down, Up, Left, Left, A, Right, Down. Which game is this from?
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:13:57
Welp, Bitcoin died again, sorry guys.
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:32:19
USAA is probably the best choice at this time.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:07:59
no difference, it just depends on how you want to label the entry
