I have used online banking since 1998 and was even part of a team that developed a Pinpad security system with a dotcom 2 years later. All online banking  is old af, secure and has no delay.

Their hope is not about having access to a decentralised means of payment, but to make money outside of the regular channels.
There is a moral issue in all of this. A desire of getting something for nothing. This is similar to wannabe singers or ballers who don't put in the hard work. An entire generation  that just wants to have everything because they're entitled to it. Maybe they shouldn't have been given those fancy toys and vacations after all. They become adult and realize the cost of money.

But you buy Bitcoin with fiat and aside from the very rare cash exchange, purchasing will happen through fund transfer which can be tracked and is already flagged to prevent money laundering, funding of terrorism and tax evasion. Therefore if you wanna buy this new Lambo with your Bitcoins you have to go through channels that are regulated and monitored.
Of course, if Bitcoin were accepted widely IRL we would not be having this conversation. Earn  Bitcoin, spend Bitcoin. That would be the ideal situation. But the taxman wants his cut, and the taxman answers to the people who keep Fiat alive. You have to obey the laws of the piece of ground under your feet.

The principle behind zero-sum games is there are winners and there are losers. With a speculative medium like Bitcoin the swings are huge. In net USD flows, your cashout was provided by people who bought at the price point you deemed like a good enough selling point. These buyers might have cashed out since  or might still be in game and the final math can only be tallied IF/WHEN all bitcoins are converted back to USD.
But at the end of the day you didn't purchase your house with Bitcoins. Say you bought 100 Bitcoins 6 years ago. Nobody would have sold you a house for that price, let alone with a little known technological instrument. But today you can, even though your Bitcoins did not grow intrinsically. It is the USD value that increased. Your currency is still USD for all practical matters. 
Bitcoin is life to you, just like water is life to some lucky farmer in Indyo, California except his water was taken from some poor schmucks south of the border.

What bugs me is that they are investing money into this, which means they have some level of liquidity. When I was a young worker I was barely making rent. Yet 20 years later I have bought and sold more than a dozen places in 3 cities and 2 continents. I chased opportunities where they were and adjusted my lifestyle to them. Now it's the other way around, choosing my lifestyle and milking my investments to make it work.

One major flaw in the current setup is that trading never stops. Which means one region can manipulate another one. While America was asleep, Asia and Europe were selling like crazy. Americans are waking up to a brand new price.

I did pick them up close to the bottom but the top is harder one. 
If you see a house that sells for 100 or 150 times monthly rent, it's great value. And if nobody shows up at the open house and if the sellers don't bother staging the place, that's the bottom for you.
But the top? Irrational exuberance and greed can be virtually infinite. I am ok with selling too early as long as I made my profit. We live in a time where paychecks are almost  frozen and the only way to riches for regular people is speculation, aided by central banks. This is the age of bubbles.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:52:23
But it seldom varies more than 1% every day. Because these currencies are used to purchase large amounts of goods. If there is a big discrepancy say between gold bought in USD and gold bought in EUR then traders will do what is called "arbitrage" to exploit this anomaly and with time this anomaly will correct, either by self-adjusting exchange rates or by having the arbitrage plays affecting the markets. For instance of too many traders buy gold in EUR to sell it in USD brcause they saw a price difference, the buys will increase the price of gold in EUR, bridging the anomaly.
This is an ages old phenomenon and fortunes are made on large volumes.
To go back to my point: yes pros running currency trades will use the fact that currency never sleeps, but not with these wild swings. 30% in one day??? 45% from top to bottom in less than 72 hours?

Acceptance will come with the feeling of safety. Wild swings happening when you sleep are anything but reassuring.
Say a merchant sells computers online but doesn't hold any stock. He sells one for 0.07 Bitcoin on EST and goes to his supplier in China to make that build and ship it to the customer. Supplier is not awake yet and looks at his costs in Bitcoin which has since lost 30% on Beijing time. The builder is losing money. You cannot do business wirh these swings. It's as if we were in 1995 when people could travel from Paris to NYC to buy electronics and it would save you twice the cost of the tickets.

Fees are taken by trading platforms and until everyone gets to Bitcoin those fees will not go away anytime soon. Fees are also taken by Bitcoin debit cards because nobody works for free and they have to convert to fiat IRL.
But even if we get rid of fiat I doubt fees will ever go away. Banks are paid for a service and for security. Only very few merchants will be able to ensure smooth, reliable and fully secure transactions and store of currency. Furthermore it shouldn't be their business in the first place. And the ultimate issue will be security of storage. The USD is secured under the FDIC system which is funded by banks to the Fed and that they can pay through collection of interests and fees. An individual with a digital wallet will have to pay to ensure a hacker doesn't take off with his coins. Or he could store them offline. Basically bank accounts (fee) or Benjamins (free). Nothing new under the sun there. 
This is an amazing technology but once it is confronted to real life problems it will have to go through the same hurdles as fiat. 
One last thing: the biggest benefit of Bitcoin is anonymity, which is perfect for buying illegal stuff, avoiding taxes or laundering money. Once exchanges and debit card companies are mandated by governments to disclose transactions over a certain amount, this competing advantage will disappear in the developed world. But good luck convincing the arms trader in Libya or the black market small guy in Venezuela to give up his Benjamins.

Retired early in the summer but not because of Bitcoin. I did it because I liquididated my biggest wins after riding 4 tech, real estate and investment bubbles. I looked at the numbers, saw I could make them work, sold my best performing assets and can now relax and enjoy my sea view and Mediterranean weather.
They say a bird in hand is better than 2 in the bush. 
Maybe I am missing out on some action by being "safe" but I am sleeping like a baby.
If you think you can retire early and comfortably with what's in your Bitcoin wallet, sell whatever you're  comfortable with but once you do it understand that you cannot afford to have regrets. Regrets is what will make you lose everything by jumping on what you think is a safe bet to "catch up" on what you missed out. Heck I sold 2000 shares of TESLA late 2010 after a 60% profit but I could have had 800% by holding. But there is no way to know.

The massive ups and downs of these past few weeks are pushing this time further ahead in the future. A currency needs price recognition to assess a fair long term value. Where is it? How many hours are you ready to work for one Bitcoin? 1 hour? 100 hours? 1000 hours? Does your landlord collect your rent in Bitcoin? Does he pay his taxes and maintenance costs in Bitcoin? Is your government willing to give up his monopoly on fiat?
There are dead ends everywhere for Bitcoin as a currency. As long as we are physical beings we will be constrained by geography and the rules of where we currently are.
But store of value? Sure.

Banks will declare all cash-like transactions over a certain amount to the IRS. It's not strictly 10K as everyone will tell you. There's frequency, patterns, etc...
If the amount is huge, hire a tax professional that will try and make your tax bill as small as possible. But never ever try and cheat the US taxman. They're unforgiving. Hell they even caught Al Capone.

Right now people are looking at live charts at the minute level. And they're restless and eager to get rich, but getting rich is measured in one yardstick: the USD. Which is deeply ironic but somehow this fails to be noticed.
Nobody says "I have accumulated enough Bitcoins to buy a Bimmer" but "my Bitcoins have appreciated so much I can buy a Bimmer".

Yes you can demand a chargeback and if the merchant wants to contest the chargeback by representing the charge he has to present a document as well. But he has to pay a fee to do that.
For the interchange fees merchants pay, they are both access fees (to pay the multiple middle men that make the transaction possible) and participation in the incentives (reward systems). 
People who are offered rewards are often people with a better credit score which represents the industry's opinion of your financial reliability, which is tied to your socio-economic bracket. Merchants want to have access to your business and have to comply to the processor's interchange rules. But its a bit like David vs Goliath. The merchant is fairly powerless in most cases.

My money is almost never sitting idle.
The purpose of money is not to sit, but to flow. The people who invented money had a problem in hand: in May or June they'd start to have a ton of fruits and vegetables that would spoil quickly. They'd need to barter for jars or hay but the guy with the jars didn't need that much produce. They figured you could give the produce to 10 buyers for tokens you could use for other stuff. It made everything more productive because it allowed humans to specialize and perfect what they were doing.
Having money for the sole purpose of money is a diversion of its original purpose. But its a free society.
My money produces interest. It produces rent through real estate investments. I am beating inflation and then some.

Your Bitcoins are no more safer than the medium on which they're stored on. Either you trust an unregulated company to do it (open to scams and hacks) or you decide to handle that security yourself (with your computer savvy or home security). In both cases, there is no FDIC  to bail you out .

Yes and no. The Arab spring started in neighbouring Tunisia after a merchant protesting corruption set himself on fire. It quickly spread 2 months later to Lybia. The West saw this as the occasion to remove the pain in the ass in Tripoli. The decision to create a competing currency was certainly a deciding factor but Ghaddafi was on a "remove whenever convenient and painless" list. The West had learned to live with him, like Assad, and nobody wanted an Operation Iraqi Freedom redux where western boots on the ground would again impose their military will.
There was massive support for militias, but as we quickly learned, in these regions there are more people willing to die for a end-of-days caliphate than a right to drink beer at a cafe or have girls wear miniskirts...

True banks can prevent you from withdrawing all your funds in a once-in-3 generation bank run.
As far as needing an internet infrastructure, I do not see a scenario where you do not have to go online at least once to broadcast a transaction. 
If the internet is down your Bitcoins are safe if they are stored offline, but thats about it. You can make a transaction but it stays with you. How do you keep making exchanges with another person long term while nothing is broadcast? Serious question.
imho this stops Bitcoin from being a last-resort currency (gold or beer caps are better that way) but I am open to counter arguments.

They withheld money 85 years ago and 9 years ago. Hopefully it won't happen again before another 70 years but building another system for that event would better add a lot more than "good against bank runs"

Atheist against Bitcoin here. But I believe we are stronger with fair rules and that only a government with proper checks and balances does the job pretty well 99.9% of the time.
The financial crises that was the origin of the movement behind Bitcoin happened precisely because forces in the financial industry managed to weaken checks and balances against their special interests. My personal hero is Lizzie Warren.

Actually a friend of mine has just gotten back with his Russian bride. Very hot. Not the latest model but hot. He's poor-ish and it looks to me if she has an angle it's only papers and a step into a better life.
Then no, you don't need a better income to get a hot wife. Just the right geography. Of course you'll be shopping for a new one in a few years but that's ok.

Neither is paper money. Original paper money was explicitely an IOU by the emitter backed by gold or silver.
If we get to the point where a government cannot exercise it's basic functions, a means of payment relying on an internet infrastructure is IS DOA

Well, Lybia is still kinda fucked 7 years later.
What Iraq taught us is that a ruthless secular autocrat is predictable and usually has a strong enough self-preservation instinct to not get himself fucked. But end-of-days nihilistic jihadis are pure evil and they're contagious.
Another lesson: whatever state of social progress was in Egypt, Turkey and a few others 30 years ago, a stratospheric demography has cancelled all of that which means the less educated have outbred the progressive elites. This is why the Arab Spring failed to deliver democracy.

Imports are changing everything. If you are dirt poor in a poor country then a hot wife will be harder to come by.

Create your private island and create your own country then. It has been tried.
But one issue with ultra individualists is that they will not fight for other people's well being, making a perfect and just libertarian society impossible.

Yes a rich person who was 20 years old and retired in a cabin in 1918 with $5000 on cash would be rather poor coming out of his cabin today at age 120.

That's not how it works. 
Guy  has a Bitcoin for sale and 0 USD. He finds a buyers Guy  at 5000 USD/BTC. He now has 5000 USD in his hands, still in circulation.
Guy  sells his Bitcoin at 19000 USD to guy  He has 14000 in profit in USD. 
No USD was ever destroyed. The same amount is in circulation. 
Now if employers start paying in BTC using BTC they got from customers and if these can pay their rent in BTC . That's another story.

The key is to bring new money in. The weak hands who SODL  must be made to believe that they have to HODL next time. They will come back to make-up for the money lost. Then it will peak, and it will crash again.
But they'll say "fool me once, shame on you" and HODL this puppy into the ground.
That's where the real money is. Repent and FOMO
