That's the funny thing about hashes. There are a limited number of outputs for any given hash function. SHA256 has 2^256 possible outputs for example, but the number of inputs is literally infinite. As a result, every single hash output has an *infinite* number of valid inputs. 
So even if you manage to find a set of data that yields the result you want from the hash function, you don't really have any idea whether or not you've come up with the input data you're trying to "reverse" in the first place: you're searching through an infinitely large haystack.
However, the point behind this is that generating a collision—where two different inputs result in the same hash output—is *really* difficult. So hash outputs, while not technically unique, are effectively "unique enough."

A fine question! I can't give an authoritative answer, because this depends on the implementation. But say you manage to find a collision for a "target" hash: what're the odds that the colliding input is both a valid public key, and that such a public key is one that you have the matching private key for as well?
The benefit here is that the hash function is laid on top of the crypto to keep track of things without being forced to reveal the keys behind a transaction until you want to spend it. But in order to complete that spending txn later, you still need to have the actual keys available to complete the math that the hashes are being used to obfuscate. 
So you collide the hash that's great, but if your input for that hash isn't valid to *the rest of the math* in a Bitcoin txn, it won't really get you anywhere.
(I think. I *may* be wrong in my understanding here, but that seems to be the gist of how and why this works with respect to Bitcoin and it's crypto)

The point is really that it doesn't matter.
The choice to use UDP or TCP in a data transfer is one that really depends on the application running on top of it more than anything else.  
UDP is extra appropriate for something like VoIP.  In a phone call, dropped packets mean you miss part of the conversation.  If you miss what I said a few seconds ago, you might want to ask me to repeat myself, but the last thing you'd want is to put the call itself on hold and re-play something from 10 seconds ago.  Put simply, "lost information" in the context of a real time application is generally irrelevant because old data is stale and no longer useful.
For something like a file transfer though... if you miss a few bits here and there, you definitely want to go back and fill those in.  TCP to the rescue.

Ask coinbase! :P
Since coinbase has the keys to your addresses, they do all the transactions for you.  Sorta like a bank, you *ask* coinbase to move money on your behalf.  But still, that address is "yours," so when you ask them to move money from one address to another, if their **books** indicate you have enough coin to cover the transaction but the address you send from doesn't actually have enough on the **blockchain** to accomplish it, they can subsidize the transfer with one of their hot wallets and then update their books accordingly.  Independently, they shuffle coins around later with their cold storage to keep everything safe and in line.
I'm guessing at this a bit, but if that's what's going on, the above is the "how" it's done.  The "why" of course is to keep things as safe as possible in the event of a catastrophic attack :P

Your argument would make sense if we were looking for laws to govern the actions of money.  But money doesn't make choices, it just does what it does.  There are times when the masses demand the government  step in on behalf of people who have been harmed by other people.
As we have government, and there are things that everyone agrees you can do with money that *shouldn't* be tolerated in society, like STEALING it, there can totally be intersection of the two and conflict therein; even while one is governed by law and the other is ruled by math.
The math means that we don't need more laws to control Bitcoin.  Those laws were written in the Genesis Block and will remain axiomatic until the end of our civilization.
This is a case of simple theft. We want to know who the thief is, and it doesn't matter what he stole: he's still a thief.  And generally speaking, it's appropriate for thieves to be brought to justice.

Then when they complain that you paid *real money* for a 90, delete it, and then buy another 90 with BTC and gank them again!

You're right about that...
Identity theft is a *problem* because we assert unique identity in a fundamentally flawed manner: we provide every party that requires us to make this assertion with a Social Security Number, and then we live our lives under some massive, shared delusion that this solitary authentication factor is a *secret*....
The magic of public key crypto is that it separates the ability to *prove that you possess* specific information from the actual *act of disclosing* it.  Ownership of Bitcoin is nothing more than knowing a number.  And if you had to disclose that information to *anyone at all*, it would be absolutely useless.  And stupid.
Until we can prove our identities in a way that doesn't require us to *literally surrender them* to everyone who wants a copy... Identity theft is going to be the dumbest and most devastating first world problem we see for quite some time.


Yeah... But so does cash, and so does chip and PIN.  Not that I think they're superior to Bitcoin, but that's a different argument of course.


It limits your liability, but it doesn't protect you from being victimized by CC theft.  And the fact of the matter is that the thief takes away something of value from the parties involved in that theft---just because you don't pay for it directly doesn't mean that you're "not paying for it."  The money's gotta come from somewhere, after all.

I recall a theory from the period of time where Gox suspended BTC withdrawals but hadn't declared bankruptcy yet that seemed plausible and was similar to this, except that transaction malleability wasn't just a scapegoat, it was the nail in the coffin that convinced MK that it wasn't worth trying to fake it anymore while he was "still ahead" of absolute insolvency.
I feel like this is one of the few financial crimes of the modern era where the world will hear any degree of truth to what really happened.
Evidence will be public and sought by a lot of scorned nerds, and I'd bet 650k Goxcoin that a frightening chunk of them are computer scientists. Sworn testimony is one thing, but it's really tough to beat the bullshit-detecting power of math when something as permanent and complete as the blockchain is involved.

The notion I've gathered over time is that the accounting was so terrible that the theft wasn't immediately apparent, and information was erased such that the data necessary to stake that claim simply didn't exist.
The picture it's trying to paint is that MK was blindsided 650k BTC deficit.
@_date: 2015-01-01 17:10:18
Because the BTC payout transactions are tied to an account in their books.
But they tracked and verified those payouts with "malleable" txn_id records, so "oops we added things up and 650k BTC is missing."

There's nothing inherently protected about USD either.  It's the platforms and services with which one moves his USD that confers protection from dishonest merchants or shoppers.
There's no reason that a similar service can't be created for Bitcoin transactions.  The point is that it doesn't *have* to exist at all for the currency to function in the online payments sector because that's just where it lives.
Since there's little or no fee for a Bitcoin transaction, grafting a service on top of it that offers this protection doesn't need to hide its money transfer costs in *their* fees, creating lower costs, and eventually, an overall superior product.
These things just take time.

\&lt;TL;DR:\&gt; Bitcoin holds potential and commands an awe-inspiring amount of technical merit with smart, logical proposals of why it **will** work. \&lt;TL;DR:\&gt;
The data in the blockchain (though it contains mechanisms to help reduce file size to something manageable on the scale of eternity) was designed such that keeping a record of every transaction *forever* is perfectly feasible.  Things started with Block 1, and if you take a look at it, it should have nothing more than a generation transaction awarding the solution to the first block. At, and after it, mining proceeded at the self-limiting rate it is today, backed by proof of work. 
Sure, there were fewer miners back then, and that's how a pizza could be purchased for a trivial amount of only 10000 BTC.  The thing about being the 1% type of BTC holder is that they're in it with the belief of the people that fostered the project in the first place.  
The protocol, what it does, and what it represents is as uncompromisingly close to perfect as anything the human race has ever conceived in all of history.  Being part of it is quite a unique thing---but not with the same character as a "once in a lifetime" type of event.  Should Bitcoin succeed, it's actually more of a "once in a civilization" type of event.  
Currency *changed the world*.  The Internet has been changing it for decades.  Using the Internet to *force* currency to be ubiquitous and provably fair for everyone and nearly free to transact... Bitcoin has that world-altering potential. 
We all really want to see it succeed, because ultimately, Bitcoin can enable so many things that absolutely no one has thought of yet.  A class of services and products that simply can't exist yet.  Imagine how easy micro transactions become when Bitcoin allows a shopping site to completely skip having to verify things to protect against fraud and chargebacks.  That's just the tip of an impossibly-deep iceberg. 
Cheers.

A private key unlocks the contents of a message that's encoded with a public key.
