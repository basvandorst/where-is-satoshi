Any idea of an iOS app that is capable of importing a wallet with the xpub? So far I can't find an option to import a xpub in Copay, breadwallet, blockchain or mycelium.

I'd like to use different address for each transaction.

Saw the drop "Ohh ill get it at $600! So cheap." Heard about the hack. "Oh maybe I'll buy more, it's at $550!"   Then I see it get to $500 -_-
I can't keep spending all my monies, but I gotta catch the bottom!

I'm no expert, but this is how I feel it goes. 
People panic and sell their coins thinking that they could be affected. This causes the price to start to drop. Once others see the price dropping they sell trying to catch the top of the wave, which in turns causes it to drop even further. 
I could be completely wrong here.

I'd think it's possible, but to dump that large of an amount quickly would probably be very difficult. I don't think there is much more worry and it should stabilize and climb back slowly.

If the hacker dumps all the coins back into a market there will be a lot more available coins. All those coins that could have been sitting in users exchange wallets for an investment are suddenly available for people to snatch up. All supply and demand.

So using zapwallettxes won't just somehow make my coin disappear right? If I read correctly it will just drop the transaction out of my client and since it never made it to the network it should just place the coin back into my wallet?

Yeah i'm not sure what I was thinking, I don't often move my coin around so I guess it really was a rookie mistake here. I tried pushing it using blockchain pushtx and it's returning "Unable To find all tx inputs"

Must have been something I did a long time ago and forgot about. You live and you learn...

Make sense, thanks for the help. I'll give it a shot right now.

A lot of people talk crap about Coinbase and it being run by bankers, but honestly that's what I've been using. I've had no problems at all. 
You could always do a P2P trade, there are places like localbitcoins where you can meet and exchange cash for BTC.
