I'm confused because you said he had it wrong but you just said the same thing he said. You're both agreeing and yet he's wrong? Or did you think he was the other person saying that it doesn't get taxed?

I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make with this but I can almost guarantee that it doesn't work

Umm... I sell Audis and a ton of my clients are millionaires.

One claimed to be very recently actually. He told me he had 60 btc but I don't know if he was legit or just trying to test drive expensive cars and act fancy for a little bit. People do that sometimes, they're usually fairly easy to pick out.

Well, they don't really need any definitive proof for civil asset forfeiture. It's some bullshit.

Still technically there, you can't touch it at all. Then they do their investigation and if anything seems slightly off they seize all of it.

I'm not even going to attempt to be clever or claim that I'm going to use it for utilitarian purposes.

Lamborghini and Audi are both owned by VW though so it's a little bit different

You don't need to launder it if it's legitimate income. You just declare it as capital gains and pay your 15%, which is a lower rate than you'd pay by laundering it...

The whole point of laundering money is to turn it into legitimate money, thereby paying taxes on it...

If you think the bottom is 3100 why not wait for that price instead of buying in at a higher limit?

Damn, that's a lot of money. Look at OP being all charitable and shit.

Do you know what an ATH is? ALL TIME HIGH. The highest price of ALL TIME, which is currently a hair under $20k. Anything lower than that number is not an ATH, because it is lower than the ATH. Jesus Christ.

When I first got into btc it was around $5 per coin. I wish I had known, I would have bought like 1000 of them.

Yes, took a loan of a million and then shortly afterwards inherited $400 million.

It was a pretty small transaction fee actually, like 1-3%. There were just so many transactions. Also bitcoin exploded then and they added up the 100 mil when btc peaked at 1100/coin.
