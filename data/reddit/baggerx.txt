It bubbles all the time like a giant, carbonated soda.... S-O-D-A, soda....

It's only great for hiding wealth of you don't care that that wealth could be wiped out very quickly when the bubble bursts.

It's certainly not a direct transfer to PayPal like the OP of this little tangent claimed.  Obviously if you exchange it for a fit currency, you can then transfer it to PayPal.  That's just stating the obvious.  Still makes no sense to do so.

Anything can be changed into money.  Having to convert it makes it less useful as a currency.  But since its volatility already makes it practically useless as a currency anyway, the point is probably moot.
This tangent started because someone claimed that Bitcoin could be deposited directly to Paypal, and that was absolutely incorrect.

Put it into a less expensive currency than Bitcoin that I think has the utility potential to be worth more, because it has a much higher potential upside than I see for Bitcoin at its current value.

Not entirely, no.  There are definitely intangible factors too.  I just don't think those will hold up as well over time as new currencies arise that perform as well or better, at least for certain types of usage.

But why would someone value Bitcoin over another currency?  That's what I'm getting at.  Seems like the price would level out with other currencies that have similar utility.
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:13:48
Isn't there a fixed maximum number of possible bitcoins?  How do they manage to hold value?  I think my biggest issue with buying into Bitcoin is that I don't understand why it holds value, or why it would hold more value than competing crypto currency over time.

Seems like a lot of speculation and assumptions there though.  Other crypto currencies can offer a lot of that, either now, or in the near future.  Not sure why people would only stick to Bitcoin when other currencies can have similar utility.  The speed thing is an issue in some cases, but that may just be a temporary advantage.
Thanks for the info though.  I was just trying to see if I'm actually missing some important piece of this.

Thanks, I'll check that out.

But it's not the only crypto currency.  Why would it hold more value than a competing currency?  Only the utility should matter, so if another currency (or several of them) gets the necessary infrastructure to be easily traded for goods and services, then wouldn't the prices level out between them?

Depends on how often you get paid.

I can see some value created just by the network effect of more people/companies buying into it and accepting it as currency, but I don't know how that will play out when nobody wants to spend because it makes more sense to hold onto it as the value goes up.  Seems like a real chicken/egg problem and the whole thing could collapse.
I know there are a ton of different crypto currencies now, but I'm not sure whether any of them will end up having enough inherent utility to become a mainstream currency.  Especially without the backing of a government or other entity with the ability to back the currency.  But in a lot of people's eyes, such backing would diminish utility too.
Guess I have more reading to do...

What are you basing that expectation on?  Why 7K?
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:43:55
That's the part I don't know.  There are a lot of things I don't know, actually.  What use cases will become popular that new currencies might handle better?  What will the reaction of major governments be as crypto currencies gain popularity and are used to bypass their control and oversight?  Will methods to trade in multiple currencies arise that make it easy to do so?  How quickly will the information and tools become available to a allow access to a wider user base (not even talking mainstream, because that seems a very long way off)?
I could probably come up with a lot more, but suffice to say, there's a lot that I still need to learn about the technology, and the individual currencies themselves.
