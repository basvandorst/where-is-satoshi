Did anyone make this yet? I can get this built and a live chain running. But what would the specs be?

What you hold on exchanges, should be there knowing you could lose it all...whether due to bad trading or exchange ineptitude.  Though seems much safer to store valuable amounts on a paper wallet, as opposed to multiple exchanges (or software/hardware wallets for that matter)...definitely don't need to build a fort knox around a piece of paper, pretty easy to protect as is

can you show me an iran version website of those sites? Or are you just saying you want to be the first...nullifying your point?  Not hostile towards you, just questionable logic here.
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:33:02
You could show the hostname, at least?
@_date: 2018-05-13 02:13:18
A paper wallet....all you have to blame is yourself if something goes wrong, as opposed to hardware or software (-stored) wallets

Is this why I can't instant sell, when I could @ ~980 earlier today?

So would a miner just keep his or her machines running normally?  What script changes would be made?
Sorry if this sounds retarded, I'm new to mining &amp; don't fully understand how the different processes work (blockchain sync with mine pool to miner etc)

+ 1000 bits I mine an altcoin, XMG (Magi) for shits and giggles - this week alone, *sixteen* people posed as regulars to try and scam others.  Seems like this is a growing problem in the crypto community...

Doesn't work for me - can't get a location (on nexus 4, tried GPS/WiFi , GPS/no WiFi etc)
This is an awesome idea though, I'd be glad to lend a hand if you need help with anything (writing, design/concept, anything else)
Your main page though, dude what...lol
Good work so far! Keep it up
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:40:21
You should only be using coinbase to buy, not hold...that should be a given with any similar site.  Buy, transfer to a paper wallet, then those coins are yours...!

Any website can be sonsidered 'all good until one day you put in your password and email and you don't get access to you account.' 
What's up with all this hate?
 'I saved the address of a wallet used for illegal activity sourced in a country on my government's list of sanctions, WTF COINBASE why you lock my account?'

What did you do for BitPay?
Or do you mind if I PM you?
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:18:41


Yeah...I'd rather control my own funds (to the best of ability).  I can pull off an exchange any time; if they get 'hacked' it's on me.  This sounds like you're literally throwing your money away.

Just like the good old days...'disabled' when price goes up, fixed when dipping...

You just assumed he doesn't know anything about bitcoin because he said your opinion is irrelevant to where the price could go....

it only takes one malware creator realizing this to create a whole new generation of code that breaks checking first 5 / last 5...there's no 'majority consensus' when it comes to malware creation :/

They're literally just another altcoin that got in early enough to create a name for themselves.  There's no proof they're legitimate either.

WTF would the point of that be?  You'd have to stay on the line indefinitely until you hope to get one random tidbit of juicy info.

All these "law experts" out of nowhere literally asking crypto users what their opinions are. Every 'expert' I've seen doesn't seem to know anything - which should be enough of a clue for most people. The whole thing seems very fishy if you ask me....
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:46:40




You should probably choose a side and stick with it, because as of now your post is null and void.

What does this mean
Did he forget the password to his Windows account, or the wallet password? Are you talking about resetting the computer or reformatting? What is 'the old windows' (probably irrelevant but curious)
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:49:47
Why is your profile picture bitcoin-related if all you do is spam trash-talk on coin subs, while avoiding questions yourself? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:06:42

I appreciate the coffees! Will download the app now.
Seriously though, if you guys are ever in need of an extra hand, let me know!  Blogging, what have you...I'd love to help out, no matter how basic the task!

Sounds like an idea that would end with people getting shorted out of their share...
(wild example) hardware vendors selling customers modems that mine, unbeknownst to the customer...
Or am I imagining this wrong? Thanks for any explanations

Do you only buy, or buy/sell to make profit (which goes towards purchasing more)? Looking for some tips on how to increase my coinage, without simply buying, buying, buying! 
@_date: 2015-04-20 22:40:57
What's the current state of altcoins (generally speaking)?
What altcoin(s) might prove valuable in the short *or* long run, and how do people determine this?  I read a lot about pump-n-dumps, and would like to try one or two alts just to get my feet wet.  Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:28:46
Helping spread the word, lots of good info here!  Thanks for the links - where do you recommend I start?
@_date: 2015-04-20 01:11:08
Hell 21 should just offer free support, if the merchant's agreeing to pay for hardware that mines for 21's profit...
@_date: 2015-04-12 01:56:37
Sorry, don't know why I asked like that. I understand the concepts behind it...  What I meant was how you like it! Do you come across a lot of blacklisted sites? Now I'm curious

How well does it work?

* Have you heard of us?
No - Should we have?  From where?  Your facebook page is DEAD!  Have you considered a stronger marketing strategy? Maybe something incentives-based (judging from this thread, you seem open to the idea!) until more people catch on? 
* What do you think of the product?
It's a genius idea - and seems like the app could be easily broken down and re-built with another sector in mind (literally anywhere that is quick, popular, yet doesnt accept BTC)
* What can we do to make it better? What are we doing poorly?
I'd start with the site (although haven't accessed it through mobile yet), definitely need more visuals/imagery to keep visitors interested.  The front page should tell people what they're getting - a bar code with $0 is not very welcoming to the average consumer.  I'd suggest a page like [this]( (just a random example, I don't even use that app) is more curiosity-provoking.  Maybe once a user enters past the front page, have a Material Design-inspired 'account page' (for example, all user info located in rows to the left of the site)
* What can we do to inspire trust?
More interaction with potential customers....what you're doing now is a perfect example.  Obviously you can't be giving stuff away all the time, but more Facebook posts (written as a coffee-drinker, rather than a dev) will help - this might prove useful if posting in various other coffee forums or coffee-related FB groups (posted from a foldapp-related account)
Good luck with everything; I'm actually stuck inside the house for who knows how long (bad car accident, can't walk) so if you're interested or need any help, feel free to shoot me a PM.  Coffee, internet, bitcoin - we already share so much in common!
