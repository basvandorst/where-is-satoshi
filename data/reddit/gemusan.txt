is correct.  We get a discount on the gift cards so we make a margin when we sell them.

My favorite professor in college was an evolutionary biologist.  I remember hearing a group of Christian students ridiculing him for believing in something that is not rooted in the "truth".
My father is a heart surgeon who practices in china.  The merit of his skills is often called into question by patients who still believe in traditional Chinese medicine.
People like to make snap judgements on things without putting time into understanding them.  Sucks but that's how the world works.

We'll look into it once the US service is running smoothly.

Interesting thought.  Let's say there are 6M actively circulating coins.  If 600,000 are given out at .01btc increments, it could potentially bring 60 million people into the ecosystem.  If only 10% of them start to actively buy coins, that's 6 million new buyers.  The price per coin will rise dramatically, perhaps many fold.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:23:27
Interesting idea.  We could potentially expand beyond Amazon and simply use this as a way to spread the message.

Amazon coupon codes are VERY product specific.  For example, there's currently a code for select shoes and handbags and another code for select watches (see the full list on [Retailmenot](  So no matter how many books, cameras, computers, DVDs you buy, there won't be a match.
If you use Honey outside of Amazon, we will find you savings about 25% of the time.  People are generally pretty happy about getting free money from a free software that took a few seconds to run.  That's why they leave positive reviews.
We are working on a new feature that will allow us to find savings for people on Amazon.  It will be released in the next few months.  Stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:02:34
Thanks for the support!  We're working hard on a new feature that will let us find people savings on Amazon.  Hopefully this bitcoin payment thing doesn't distract us too much.  :D

Amazon's gift card API lets us buy the exact amount.  Hopefully they're willing to work with us.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:25:07
Sorry to hear.  What stores have you tried it on?
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:58:45
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:37:37
Payment processors like Coinbase and Bitpay immediately convert btc to fiat so there's no currency risk.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:20:21
Agreed.  Even if someone else does exactly what we proposed, we'll be cheering from the sidelines.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:08:28
If you don't already have bitcoins, there's no reason for you to transact with bitcoin vs. CC.
However, there are a lot of people who do have bitcoins.  This will bring more liquidity to the coins they hold.  Let's say you have some bitcoins and you want to cash out to buy a TV.  You can either cash out from the exchange, wait for the money to hit your bank, and buy with fiat.  Or you can buy directly with btc.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:01:53
The verification will be immediate.  The gift card purchase should take 2-4 seconds.  The whole process shouldn't take more than 15 seconds.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:35:07
:)  We don't mind if someone else takes the idea.  The goal is to help demonstrate btc's potential as a payment system.  Are you a developer?  
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:52:27
Yup this is my third time around and I agree this does not affect the long term outlook.  Just trying to think of possible scenarios where the price doesn't crater in the near term.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:08:29
We haven't thought that far yet.  It was just an idea we had during a brainstorm session and we wanted to test the water.
We're not greedy though so it should be reasonable.  :)
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:30:42
Thanks for the heads up.  We hadn't really considered this since we've seen companies like Gyft sell Amazon gift cards for bitcoins.  Will definitely do some research on the legality of it.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:54:35
Yea, btc is currently primarily used for store of value and speculation.  It won't realize its full potential until people start spending it as a currency.  Hopefully a feature like this will get us there sooner.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:36:04
We will have to check with Amazon to see if they will allow us to buy gift cards in other currencies.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:10:00
Believe it or not, we're working on something eerily similar right now.  The image recognition and cross-site product matching are hard problems to solve, but we're making good progress.

haha didn't some guy in Europe just get jail time for doing something like this?
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:03:20
What stores have you tried it on?  If you shop at only Amazon and Newegg, then the chance is low.  Outside of Amazon/Newegg, the chance of you landing some savings is ~25% (1 in 4 purchases).
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:24:38
Newegg sells very low margin products so it's very rare to find coupons that work there.  For example, currently there's a code for "Rosewill RK-700M Black 104 Normal Keys 12 Function Keys USB Wired Multimedia Keyboard" and another for "Seagate Barracuda ST1000DM003 1TB 7200 RPM 64MB Cache SATA 6.0Gb/S 3.5" Internal Hard Drive Bare Drive".  If you are not buying these 2 exact products, there's no code that will work for your cart.
Please understand that Honey can only find and apply existing codes.  But even if it doesn't find a working code, it saves you the trouble of searching and trying codes yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:39:10
Yea, but we don't currently support IE and Safari.  Thinking about IE gives me a headache...
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:13:28

We're always looking for talented people to work with!  Shoot me an email at george [at] our url.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:52:31
Yup.  Coinbase's API will let us do this.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:46:09
We're looking into this as well.  Amazon provides an API that lets us buy gift cards in exact amounts in real-time, so it seems the easiest.  We'll do some research to see if there's something like it for visa/mastercard.

@_date: 2013-12-12 23:11:53
I think we will have to require coinbase account because we don't want to keep people waiting while the confirmation is taking place.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:25:51
Honey tries all the valid codes that has worked for other people.
Honey does something fundamentally different from Retailmenot.  If you start shopping at Retailmenot, you are going to buy things you might not buy otherwise.  When you use Honey, it checks to make sure you are not leaving money on the table.  Honey does not push you to buy anything that you weren't going to buy.  
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:41:41
Payment processors like coinbase and bitpay will make this instantaneous.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:27:55

Whoa, I LOVE RES!  Thank you for developing something so damn cool.
We definitely want to support other browsers but didn't want to deal with the headache of maintaining multiple codebases.  BabelExt sounds like the perfect solution.  Thank you so much.
@_date: 2013-12-13 08:05:00
The availability of coupon codes depends on the merchant and the timing.  There was A LOT of codes last week, but much fewer this week.  Generally speaking, high margin businesses like apparel, online printing, domain, etc. have more codes.  Low margin businesses like Amazon and Newegg have few, if any codes.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:46:12
Don't.  It'll cost more in electricity than what you would get in return.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:49:49
Thanks for the tip!
We are currently working on other ways to help people find savings.  The challenge with finding coupons at checkout is that the success rate depends on the store and what you're buying.  If you shop at stores that issue site wide coupons often, then the success rate is high.  On stores like Newegg where the coupon codes only apply to a certain model of a particular brand, the success rate is low.  We're working on a solution that will be unveiled soon.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:08:56
You won't be registering a wallet with Honey.  Honey will act like a gift card seller that you pay directly with your wallet.

Thank you for the insight on Europe's CC culture.  Sounds like we'll have to speed up support for European stores sooner rather than later.    
Great feedback on the UX.  We will take them into consideration when we start to design the product.

Snapcard looks interesting.  If I understand it correctly, you are paying Snapcard in btc, and Snapcard is placing an order with the merchant on your behalf.  This makes return/warranty/customer service a little harder to deal with.

Fiat has an important advantage over bitcoin - it came with built-in network effect.  Every member of society has to be a part of the fiat network whether you like it or not.
Bitcoin has to build the network piece by piece.  Infrastructure, awareness, users, applications, legal framework, etc.  The speculative bubble actually accelerates the process.
Take the dotcom bubble.  People often talk about it as a great economic failure.  But the truth is that all that money that poured into the bubble helped finance the infrastructure of the internet that we're using today.  Without that bubble, the groundwork couldn't be laid.
Bitcoin's day as a widely used currency will come.  We have to build the network first.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:20:44
If you're in the US, buying bitcoins from coinbase is pretty drop dead simple.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:54:23
SnapCard looks like a great service and there are advantages to their method vs. what we're proposing.  For example, they can support far more stores than we can.
There's 1 key difference.  SnapCard places the order on your behalf so if you have any issues with the order, you will deal with SnapCard instead of the merchant.  These purchases also won't show up in your account history with the merchant.  
There are tradeoffs to both methods, but having options is good!
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:18:37
We will probably publish the data publicly on our blog.
This is definitely a stopgap feature and we believe that all online merchants will start accepting bitcoins in the near future.  We just want to help get it there sooner.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:16:23
I hear you.  But at this point in the adoption curve, bitcoins are worth something because people want it, not because of its utility.  However, people want it because of the promise of its future utility.
For bitcoin to make payment easier, it needs to build the network of consumers willing to spend it and merchants willing to accept it.  We can make bitcoins a lot easier for consumer to spend.  In doing so, there's more incentive for merchants to accept it.
If we have the power to convince Amazon to accept bitcoins, we would do it.  We don't have that power, so we're doing what we can within our own limitation.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:22:37
You are right in that a lot of people are currently using bitcoin as a low fee, high utility, digital swiss bank account, with 8700% annual interest. This trend will undoubtedly continue.
Now imagine if you can also pay your friend, pay for your lunch, and tip a Youtuber $0.25 with this swiss bank account... instantly and cheaply.
When people have their assets stored in this swiss bank account, they don't want to go through the hassle of converting it to another currency.  They just want to pay and be done with it.
That's how bitcoin will evolve.  People need to first transfer value into this swiss bank account.  When that happens, they will naturally want to pay directly out of this same account.
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:57:46
That's the goal.  We want to show large online retailers that it's low risk and profitable to accept btc.  If they adopt, we've done our job.
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:49:24


I'm confused.  Why did you make this statement if you don't think bitcoin is a great means of exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:07:15
People will be buying from Amazon with their normal account.  We're simply applying a gift card that takes the balance down to $0.
Please apologize to your housemate for us.  We are going through growing pains and it's taking all of our time to keep the service running for US stores.  We will focus on making Honey better for international sites once we have more help.
