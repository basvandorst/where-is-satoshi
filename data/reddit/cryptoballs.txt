Do you have crypto yet or just a handful of ‘shitbits’ (fiat)?
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:28:45
Just give your kids the PK. If you don’t trust them give your lawyer the PK and give your kids a cypher to decipher your hand written code

What description do you put on the transaction?

ConSensus sucks ass... now the entire market hurts ����‍♂️

What is the comparison to all the banks and financial institutions of the world?
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:57:06
This is both awesome and unnecessary; well done.
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:18:47
Brave.io (using BAT)?
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:35:00
Yes they are, I read about it on Wikipedia.
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:24:46
The only way the crypto is going to disrupt the banking industry is with mass adoption and the current experience is beyond most users. CoinBase gets people in the door to learn more.

Ledger Nano S is cheap and the best option for you. MAKE SURE YOU BACKUP THE RECOVERY PHRASE SECURELY!
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:41:20
Good work that man.
@_date: 2018-05-30 11:29:55
Hahah spot on! Keep trying to fight the rising tide ����

His google analytics would be off the charts.

Those same companies are now complaining about profit losses due to the bans:
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:12:12
I think that is a little unfair. They are making crypto usable for millions of people which is good for adoption. Eventually there will be other solutions that fix the UX of crypto but until then I am happy for CoinBase to be centralized... it is a stepping stone.
@_date: 2018-05-18 09:49:03
Bitcoin or basically any crypto (the majority anyways)
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:28:56
Be aware that it is charged as a cash advance from your credit card so you pay 3.99% to CoinBase and then your cash advance fee to your credit card and then the ongoing high cash advance interest fee �� 
It becomes very expensive but in a Bull market, YOLO

News Update: Vitalik wears a strange unicorn and rainbow t-shirt whilst obliterating somebody on Twitter during a presentation/panel.
@_date: 2018-05-06 23:33:03
CoinBase is easy and not overly expensive 
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:18:21
Finally worked out they cannot rely upon oil forever?
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:53:37
Was this a happy ending?
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:43:28
Oh shit, ok thanks. What about Dether?
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:19:29
You must listen to The Godfather ����‍��
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:46:44
If it is on Wikipedia then it is fact.
@_date: 2018-05-07 06:13:04
Nah it is the best UX you can currently find for crypto.

Is Satoshi god?
@_date: 2018-05-14 20:48:29
Move passed the currency and look at the technology you chump! ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:18:20
Close but I think you can put a BitCoin (as representative for cryptocurrency) in front of all of them. Money is just the first app...
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:02:21
Disagree. Cryptocurrency is the ‘killer-app’ of blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:34:06
Strap in!
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:38:30
Give it up BCH, you suck.
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:14:46
Run baby run!
