Every input your wallet receives creates more space required on the blockchain when you send those again as outputs. So if somebody sends you $5 worth of Bitcoin right now, that input is essentially stuck due to high tx fees. Schnorr signatures I believe will fix this issue, however.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:06:45
I'm surprised it's been 3 days (edit: It says received yesterday??). It should confirm soon. Looks like you're not spending any unconfirmed inputs, which is good. 
P.S. Why you not using segwit? :) 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:25:33
Question: With Schnorr sigs, if I have an address with 100 inputs, can I sent all 100 inputs as if they were 1 input (as far as block space is concerend). I'm still a bit confused on how this will work. Thanks

@_date: 2018-01-04 17:23:58
Could be a few reasons. Some wallets will continue to rebroadcast a transaction, which theoretically could make sure it stays stuck forever. Another reason is that nodes can adjust their default timeout time to be much longer than 72 hours.

Google lightning network. It's currently in beta, and mostly used on testnet, but some transactions have been successfully done on mainnet. We will most likely start to see adoption and real use sometime this year.

This may not happen for years. In the meantime Bitcoin could seriously fall to  in market share.
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:40:54
The real answer to this sadly will have to be a block size increase. I see no other way.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:37:55
Yes, fees will likely go up. But you're thinking about it in the wrong way. The amount of transactions in the mempool with a very high sat/byte fee are simply people willing to pay that high of a fee to get through. Fees are only as high as people are willing to pay to get through. It doesn't really have much to do with the price of bitcoin - directly anyway.
Fees will likely remain high or even higher until some sort of scaling solution is put in place. Lightning Network is promising, and can fix a lot of issue, but likely a block size increase will be required at some point.. Hopefully sooner than later IMO.

No I don't think this is correct. Once your coins are on the "lightning network", you can basically transact with anyone else with their coins on the network through channel hops. This is how I understand it.

@_date: 2018-01-30 05:16:14
I hear ya. You're also guaranteeing you'll be in the next block if you throw in a big tip like that. So for large TXs this is completely reasonable.

@_date: 2019-07-15 20:48:02
As far as sending to exchanges, you can send back to any time of address you want. As far as receiving bitcoin, yes the exchange has to support it.
You don't have to delete your old wallet. You can keep both. But moving the majority of your coins to native segwit addresses is good for the network in the long run.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:19:57
Okay so I'm getting conflicting answers... So spending multiple inputs from the same private key won't be optimized with schnorr sigs? So if I'm getting a mining payout every day, I should be changing the payout address every day??

You can avoid paying transaction fees when withdrawing from coinbase by moving your funds to coinbase pro, and then withdrawing from there.

I think they are FDIC insured, which if I recall "only" covers a couple hundred thousand at the most.
However, that insurance only applies if coinbase gets hacked. If your coinbase ACCOUNT gets hacked, that's on you. 
I would never store a large amount of funds on any exchange, ever. If you're going to cash out bitcoin, move and sell  relatively small chunks onto the exchange at a time.

And what incentive would they have to do this? If you own that much hash power, then that means most of the blocks that have already been mined have seen their block rewards gone to said miners. So why would they want to give up those rewards? Why would they waste all that hash power just to reorg the chain? Not to mention, with only 51% hashpower, it would takes MONTHS just to reorg the chain from 24 hours ago. Not to mention, Bitcoin is their livelihood. Why would they want to damage the trust and security of the network that feeds them their wealth? There is so many good reasons not to do a reorg, and so much computing power that would be required to do so that it just isn't feasible.

No way... Unless:
1. Bitcoin breaks
2. Another PoW chain takes over BTC's hashrate
Neither of these things are likely to happen. And as long as they don't happen, bitcoin will continue to be a positive feedback loop when it comes to its price. The more bitcoin is worth, the higher the bounty is for hackers. The more the hackers fail, and the longer bitcoin stays secure, the more it will be valued, which increases the bounty even more, which causes the hackers to hack harder, which proves even more so how secure the network is... and on, and on, and on.
I'm convinced in the next 10 years we'll see $100k BTC.
However, I will not even be surprised if it hits $100k in 2-5 years.

I actually don't use the hardware wallet to generate my seeds. I create my own seed(s), and double verify that the seed + chosen passphrase generate the same private/public keys with electrum AND  [ on an air-gapped computer that will never touch the internet ever again, and then I feel confident in sending my funds to the first derived public address from that generated wallet. That way I don't have to trust my hardware wallet to keep my private keys safe. In fact I don't even consider private keys stored on a hardware wallet as "cold storage".
I guess in the end, it's just more nerve wracking spending from an address that has 99% of the bitcoin you own, vs spending from an address that has 10% of the bitcoin you own.

Don't think about it like that. Think about it in these terms: once we go higher than 1mb, there's no going back, which is why we have to be careful with block size, as it's a one way street. Block size will be increased eventually. Though I think we will have to see a severely congested mempool for it to find consensus for it to happen, unfortunately. Personally I don't think doubling the block size would hurt the decentralization or stability of the protocol, but I'm just a single idiot.

Yes, I should have been more clear. Each UTXO would ideally be managed by a different HD wallet.
My main concern is the chance of losing the coins when you eventually move them. HD wallets are super convenient, but I hate trusting my hardware wallet to send my change to a new (and correct) public address (the nano s doesn't even show you the change address when signing a transaction!)
I guess my thought is, if because of user error, or hardware wallet malfunction, if my coins are split up between 10 different wallets, I lose 10% of my coins rather than 100% should something go wrong. The downside is it's more to keep track of, and more on chain fees I'll have to eventually pay to move them.

This is the TA I've been waiting for.
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:34:10
You realize only a very small percentage of the world has the luxuries you're talking about, right? You're 100% correct that the use case for bitcoin as a payment rail in 1st world countries is not that strong. However, that doesn't mean it won't be adopted by first world countries. Keep in mind mass adoption does not require the eradication of fiat. Likely bitcoin and fiat will co-exist for a long long time, even when bitcoin has a 10 trillion dollar market cap.
@_date: 2019-07-02 19:41:05
Short answer: No. No matter how infested your computer is with malware, your keys are safe.
However... That doesn't mean that malware cannot send a transaction request to your hardware wallet that you did not intend. This is why verifying the output address on your hardware wallet whenever sending bitcoin is the most important step in the process.
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:51:26
I think a better way to word this is: Wanting to keep base-layer fees LOW is an incentive to use lightning.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:49:50
Personally I think this time is different. I think TX fees are starting to catch up with us, and the market is reflecting that. I'm a huge BTC supporter, I'm just trying to be objective. LN can't come soon enough.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:11:16
How many inputs does your wallet have? Also, I'm not familiar with the btc.com wallet, but you should be able to export your private keys, and then make a transaction with a custom fee.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:40:48
Ya I'm watching it. If I smell a bottom I will buy a bit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:36:32
I doubt it will go that low, but I could be very wrong. I just bought a bit at 18400

@_date: 2017-12-14 05:15:07
Sweet, I will try that, thanks! And ya, I don't trust the websites to make paper wallets 100%, which is why when I DO, I like to verify they work on multiple sources before I send any funds to it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:14:54
The ironic thing is, is if Bcash were to ever overtake Bitcoin's market cap (lol?), the whole world I think would completely lose trust in crypto currencies. At least for a very long time.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:54:42
Nevermind! I randomly saw a link to this on another thread:
For those that are interested.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:23:18
Let's be generous and say there is 15 million bitcoin out there with private keys that are NOT lost (There's certainly actually less).
There is 7.53 billion people in the world.
15 mil / 7.53 bill = 0.002 bitcoin per person that is live (200,000 satoshis)
Let's assume in 10 years only 1% of the world's population is interested in holding bitcoin. 
That leaves 0.2 Bitcoin per person (Maybe a little more since more bitcoin will have been mined since then, but I was also generous on how much has been lost)
Keep in mind, 1% of the world's population makes up 23% of the United States population alone. Is it unreasonable to think that in 10 years, at least 23% of the united states will want to hold bitcoin? Whether in their own wallets, or in their 401k? 
If so, if you divide the total supply of bitcoin among them evenly, you only get 0.2 bitcoin for each person. This is assuming only 23% of the U.S. will be interested in bitcoin, and more importantly, it's assuming that not a single person in any other country is interested in bitcoin whatsoever. Obviously this isn't the case.
When you really start to grasp the scarcity, you really start to see how a $1mil btc could actually happen.  Especially when you take into account that hodlers will continue to hodl, making it extremely hard for newcomers to stack sats.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:50:37
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:01:06
So I went ahead and used CPFP with coinb.in following the tutorial in this video:
I can now see my CPFP transaction on blockchain.info with a 5,200 sat/byte fee. (I guess it's not accounting for the first transaction in the chain when calculating sat/byte?) Combined, it's now set at about 88.07 sat / byte (if I'm done my math right)... Still low so will probably take a few days to go through, but that's okay. I just REALLY hope I did it right, or I'm out a lot of money, haha! Thanks for your help guys.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:39:27
You can split a 1 foot ruler into an infinite amount of tiny measurements but it is still 1 foot. It's the valuation of all 21 million Bitcoin that really matters. Being able to move fractions of a Bitcoin is for practicality and convenience.

@_date: 2017-12-12 20:22:48
You were scammed. Luckily as long as you have access to your Bcash wallet, you can swap it for REAL bitcoin using an exchange. Bitcoin.org is the real website (or as close to real as you can get).
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:20:05

@_date: 2017-12-07 23:30:49
215K unconfirmed now. What sucks is every time I even mention a slight block size increase I get down voted like crazy on this forum. I know block size increase isn't a long term solution, but we need some breathing room, badly. (Yes I know segwit hasn't been fully adopted yet)
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:25:25
Don't do it. They won't appreciate it and lose it most likely
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:21:41
In my opinion, the best long term strategy is to allocate a certain amount of funds per pay check to invest in bitcoin.
50% of it, use to DCA.
50% of it, use to buy dips.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:54:36
Oh I see! Yes the wallet I am sweeping had had a lot of small receives. Is there nothing I can do to avoid paying a $100 dollar fee then? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:43
This is the greatest FUD of all time.... Yet I will continue to HODL.

@_date: 2017-12-24 00:53:05
Man I hope this is the case.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:31:13
In that case, a paper segwit wallet would be the best way I think.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:34:53
They're also going to enable Buy/Sell for Bcash... So they have time to add more products, but not enough time to enable segwit. Wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:03:59
Oh wow. I assume I'd still have to clean up any old utxos from before fork, ya?
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:30:07
No, but I'd like to be able to move $100 worth without being raped.
@_date: 2019-07-08 06:19:16
Mimble wimble would be a pretty extreme change and hard fork, wouldn't it? If so I have a hard time seeing that happen with consensus.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:32:55
This one is free also, but I think it needs to be at least 10 sat / byte, and they only accelerate 100 TXs every hour.
@_date: 2019-07-12 20:52:56
I always wonder how many of these "hacks" are inside jobs.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:24:17
Thinking about this, won't sweeping it into another wallet be seen as a double spend by the blockchain?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:15:56
You can try to get a mining pool to accelerate it, but they usually charge quite a bit of $ to do it. The other option is to just wait it out and hope that the transaction clears from the mempool and your coins return to your wallet. Hopefully blockchain.info isn't rebroadcasting your transaction over and over...
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:44:57
Wtf, this is going to give me nightmares.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:54:03
Great interview! Though I wish she would have talked more about a timeline. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:40:53
Considering the potential for there be millions of dollars there, I would be very very careful who you get to help you. If I were in your shoes, before I even touched anything, I would educate myself on how bitcoin works. Learn about public keys, private keys, wallet.dat files, etc. 
I would even buy a tiny bit of bitcoin from coinbase, and get comfortable with transferring it to your own wallets, and transferring it back to gdax or coinbase. Get comfortable with how to sell it etc. 
This is a technology where YOU are responsible for the security of your funds, and if you don't know what you're doing, you can easily lose it all.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:02:22
I'm glad I'm learning this now. Thanks so much for the information, guys.

Make it stop.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:47:36
I used coinomi, and made the mistake of sweeping a paper wallet with only a 7 sat / byte fee.. Guess I'm not sure what to do now :(. Doesn't look like coinomi supports the ability to rebroadcast with a higher fee. Any suggestions? Thanks!!

Okay cool, I will give that a try! Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:32:05
You can try here. He does it for free supposedly. If you ask for a quote to guarantee it to get pushed through, he'll give you a quote. Just give him the transaction ID.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:06:09
Lol wtf
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:26:26
That is probably the worst place to buy bitcoin. The amount they charge you in fees is ridiculous. I would suggest cash app, coinbase pro, gemini, or bisq.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:42:54
Okay that's good for you... Not so good for new adopters.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:59:31
After how long? And are you using any kind of acceleration from a mining pool? I'm just not sure how a 25 sat/byte transaction could possibly go through naturally with this congestion.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:59:16
This is amazing. Well earned by him.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:15

@_date: 2017-12-13 16:27:32
Hmm, okay. I hope you're right. After some google searches, some posts came up in 2015 about only one mining pool supporting the CPFP functionality. /shrug
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:39
If you're moving all funds from a wallet that has a ton of UXTOs it's already $90 and can be much higher. Solutions are coming though, fear not. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:19:41
The receiving address is in Coinomi. Coinomi doesn't seem to let me send from the receiving address because the sweep transaction isn't confirmed yet. I don't think Coinomi supports CPFP. Is there a way to move my coinomi wallet private key(s) to a different one that supports CPFP? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:12:18

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:03:54
I 100% back the OP on this. You have my vote. I think hard drive space and computing power will keep up over time if we double the block size.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:06:59
Would this still work if you have 1 address with multiple inputs? Rather than multiple addresses with 1 input?

This is amazing. Make sure these charities know they came from bitcoin! Spread the word/love!
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:13:23
Ya, I know 90 is pretty low. But no I'm asking if the CPFP functionality is enabled on most mining pools. I know in 2015 like only one or two mining pools had it enabled.
@_date: 2019-07-21 06:56:31
Yup. Opened up a bunch of lightning channels for pennies.
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:33:46
I know increasing the block size too much is a bad thing for decentralization, but it needs to be more than 1 mb... I really hope we see a 2x fork early 2018. And more wallets and exchanges need to use segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:00:26

@_date: 2017-12-12 14:28:04
Dude this interview has my hyped haha
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:57:22
Yes, this is what bothers me. You would think BTC TX fees would be more tied to how much they are worth, but it seems it's not this way.. And following the trend, if you need over $100 worth of bitcoin to open a payment channel (when 1 BTC = $1 mil), that won't be good.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:29:26

I understand this, but it seems as the bitcoin price has gone up, the fees have gone up with it. Would you say this is just due to increased use of the blockchain? And has nothing to do with the price of bitcoin going up directly?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:51:35
Hope you're right. But Bcash on Coinbase is a bit of a game changer, wouldn't you say?

@_date: 2017-12-22 01:27:38
Watching this interview twice through has only reinforced my belief that a second layer like lightning is the only true scaling solution for a block-chain that wants to remain decentralized and censorship resistant.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:17:04
The first transaction in the chain is 12000 bytes. So I had to apply a high fee to the cpfp transaction (129 bytes or so) to incentivise miners to mine the transaction before it. At least that's how I understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:58:26
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:00:21
Ya, I foresee the block size being increased a bit for some short term relief, but like you said, it's not a good long term solution.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:30:08
The best thing we can do right now is advocate for people to use segwit wallets, and to hound exchanges to upgrade to segwit. I'm looking at you, coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:08
I do...
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:44:19
You're probably right, but the massive Bcash pump has me worried.

I agree with your concern about Lightning apps. I think the masses will need to simply see a "send" and "receive" button in order for this to be mass adopted.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:57:41
A second layer protocol to bitcoin (or other segwit coins) that allows payment channels to be created off of the primary bitcoin blockchain. Like I said in the OP, it essentially allows for millions to billions of transactions processed per second for almost zero fees. Lightning will also allow for atomic swaps of other coins that support Lightning (such as litecoin or vertcoin), eliminating the need for an exchange to trade coins for coins.

Block-chains can't be used as a currency, in the same way that Ethernet alone cannot power the internet. Lightning is coming. If you're that worried, sell all your coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:37:38
Roger misleading people as always. Conveniently leaving out the fact that lightning network is just around the corner.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:04:25
It may not. Technology might be able to keep up, allowing the average Joe to run a node. But in the end, 8mb blocks would get full and we would have the same problem that we do now. With that said, I would support a segwit2x if there was community support for it while we wait for lighting. I think this would give us some much needed temporary relief short term.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:51:20
Fuck ya
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:31:04
Yup, and and any other block chain based alt coin including bcash will have the exact same problem once their blocks fill up as well. (And they WOULD fill up if they became the market leader due to popularity and spam attacks).

What if I told you - you can support lightning as a long-term solution, but can also support a block size increase as a short term one?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:57:49
So when I try to sweep it into Mycellium, it shows the current balance of the wallet as "0", and in green below it says "Sending 0.XXX BTC", which is the total amount I am trying to sweep into Coinomi. So it's as if Mycellium already sees the transaction in the mempool and so it won't let me try to sweep funds that are already attempting to be sent somewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:35:22
My feelings exactly hahaha. Nothing is more nerve wracking then sending 50% of your bitcoin to a new wallet.

I'd like to say it's the same as before like others are saying.. But this time Coinbase has added it to its platform, which is a pretty big game changer if you ask me. Bitcoin needs an on-chain scaling solution announcement ASAP IMO.

While you guys are focused on the price, meanwhile we're approaching 200k unconfirmed transactions... 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:48:49
to better relay what I'm trying to say.. Let's say hypothetically Bitcoin's price plummeted to $1500 tomorrow, but the # of transactions stayed the same on the network. Would the average fee now go from 200 sat / byte to 2000 sat / byte? Assuming the price of bitcoin isn't related to the fees that is. Because technically the value that 1 sat represents has now changed, so the fee in satoshis should change with the price of bitcoin if what you're saying is correct.

Because - if I understand the protocol correctly - each individual user will have to open up a channel with their funds. So if you have some bitcoin in cold storage right now, if you want to pull some out to use on lightning, you will have to open a payment channel first which means making a transaction on the block chain.

I see what you're saying. However, if there is a large majority consensus, that should be all that matters, in my humble opinion. With a large consensus, the Mimblewimble version would keep the BTC ticker, exchanges would call it Bitcoin, and the hash power would follow. And the old minority fork would go the way of obscurity.

Think of the Bitcoin protocol as a security / settlement layer. Lightning, or other 2nd layer protocols will likely end up being the commonly used layer for payments which will certainly be instantaneous and essentially free. In the end, 99% of bitcoin users won't even realize they are using these added layers, as it will all happen in the background automatically, much like the internet works today for a typical user.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:14:02
This will happen. It's a paradigm shift that will occur once two things happen:
1. Major exchanges support lightning deposits and withdrawals.
2. Income capacity is easier to come by (I'm hoping this problem can be automated out of existence).

Yes, this makes sense. But because the default is set to 1 sat / byte, most nodes on the network will simply ignore signed transactions set less than that, ya? Doesn't this greatly decrease the chance of your transaction from being mined? (Even if the mempool is completely empty).

Make sure you're not sending a massive fee with your transaction. Lately 1 sat per byte fees (1 to 2 pennies) are going through all the time. Most wallets have horrible fee estimates and will suggest or sometimes even force you to pay way too much in fees.

Ya, I'm waiting for a lightning channel to open right now with 1 sat / byte fee. Bitcoin has definitely taught me patience, if nothing else. I do secretly wish we would upgrade to 4mb blocks, but at this point I'm pretty sure the mempool would have to hit 500k-1mil unconfirmed TXs before we found consensus for that...

If you see it in the mempool, it will clear, probably today, possibly in the next hour or two.
@_date: 2019-06-08 01:23:06
Keep in mind BCH and BSV blocks are MUCH smaller than bitcoin's blocks. They can bost no-fee transactions because hardly anyone is using those chains, as they aren't nearly as secure as BTC.
Bigger blocks will likely come eventually. Sadly I think it will take a 500k mempool $100 minimum fee emergency for it to happen. I wish this wasn't the case. It's a consensus network, though, and right now the consensus is that blocks stay the size that they are.
And while I think we should double the block size, I 100% understand why people are wary of it. Decentralization is the beating heart of bitcoin. We can't risk damaging that at almost any cost.

I'll be surprised if we see $1mil bitcoin in our lifetime. Don't get me wrong, I think it's going to do well, but I think even $100k is going to be way harder to attain than most people think. My guess would be $100k in about 5-10 years, and then volatility will chill out and probably much lower gains from then on out. I hope I'm wrong, I'm just trying to be somewhat realistic.
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:53:47
$0.01 (1 sat/byte) fees are clearing every couple days or so. If someone wants to make a $5 transaction on the most secure, immutable ledger the world has ever seen, they should probably be okay with waiting a few days for it to confirm... In the end, 99% of small transactions like these will be done off-chain on a second / third layer (such as Lightning network).
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:42:58
Only BCH shills and acolytes are saying that, and the most hardcore BTC maximalists. Probably 99% of the bitcoin community wants bitcoin to be both things.

I agree, but at a certain point, there will be more people trying to do legitimate personal transactions than there is room for in each block. Depending on the time of day, I'd say we've already gotten there, to be honest. What is it... 4MB blocks = 1 TB in blockchain size every 5 years? Assuming every single block is full to the max? I realize sync time is also an issue, but I mean come on you can get a 2TB drive on amazon NOW in 2019 for under $60.

@_date: 2019-06-25 12:36:46
I'm not sure ledger live supports it yet, but electrum does, and you can use electrum with your nano s 
1. Create a new wallet with electrum, and connect it to your nano. It will ask what type of addresses you want your nano to generate, so choose native segwit. 
2. Go to the receive tab in electrum, and click the eye ball graphic to verify the receive address on your nano. Copy the address it, and save it somewhere (it should start with bc1).
3. Close electrum completely, and open ledger live, and send your funds to the new bc1 address.
After that, once ledger live patches in bech32 (which I believe is coming next patch) you can access your funds from there, but until then you can use electrum .
@_date: 2019-06-08 01:28:27
Yes, it limits the possible transactions per second severely. To become a global currency, we need an order of magnitude increase in transactions per second. This isn't possible currently with blockchain tech, unless you want to completely destroy decentralization (see XRP).
The bitcoin community has agreed that the only way to achieve this without sacrificing key aspects of the network is to move merchant type transactions onto a second layer protocol. The most promising and actually working one right now is called the lightning network. I'd do some research on that if I were you.
@_date: 2019-06-10 02:53:31

It's on its way to being a currency, but right now it's a pretty poor currency. EVEN if blocks were empty all the time, sometimes you can go an hour or more without a block being mined... So are you supposed to sit there in the cash register line until your transaction is mined to make sure you don't initiate a double spend as soon as you walk out the door? This fact alone makes bitcoin (and BCH, LTC, etc...) horrible currencies on the block chain layer in my opinion.
2nd layer solutions (LN specifically) are still in their infancy. I'm guessing it's going to be at least 2 years before LN becomes simple enough to use that anyone can start using it, and using it dependably (Though much shorter for exchanges to start using it).
Once 2nd layer starts to shine though, it's going to blow the doors open.

To be honest, in my own head I go back and forth on the block size debate constantly. I think increasing it right now *might* be a mistake. Once 90% of all transactions in a block are coming for bech32 address inputs, and average fees are STILL relatively high, then I would be more apt to support a block size increase.
The best thing we can do as a community right now is educate people, and try to accellerate segwit adoption.
I do have a big fear though of seeing a 500k tx mempool during the next big bull run, however. I think if this happens, it could do a lot of damage to Bitcoin, as it would essentially freeze up a lot of people's funds.

Maybe... It's a long shot. My personal prediction would be in 10 years, 1 BTC = $250k (in 2029 dollars). But some people think it can get as high as 1 to 10 mil. I personally don't think that will happen in our lifetime though.

If investing in Bitcoin is speculative, then so is investing in gold.  With that said, I simply cannot wait for LN to be fully tested, rock solid, and on mainnet with user friendly apps, so Bitcoin can finally be used as real competitive micro-transaction currency. At that point, all the "speculative" arguments can RIP.

the total fee amount is kind of irrelevant. The amount of satoshi's per byte is what matters. What sat / byte fee did you send with the transaction?
Regardless, even the lowest possible fee of 1 sat / byte, which is usually about a penny, will get confirmed in a relatively short time, usually no more than a few days.

When I first got into this space, I was mostly in it for the gains. Now I don't care about the gains. I've become obsessed with the tech. I'm somewhat of a nihilist, and have always thought there was nothing I could really contribute to the intellectual and moral evolution of our species as just a lone individual... That is until Bitcoin. I am convinced that running a full bitcoin node (and lightning node) is the best thing anyone can do for humanity (aside from actually being a bitcoin dev). It is a direct way to make an actual impact, as it flies directly in the face of all the monopolists, and their violent, controlling ways. If we value freedom, liberty, peace, and voluntary cooperation between our fellow humans, despite our other ideological differences, we need to embrace a decentralized future, or those values will never be realized.
TLDR: Get into Bitcoin for the tech, not the gains.

Every block that gets mined after governments declare bitcoin illegal would just prove how secure and unstoppable the network is. Bring it on.
@_date: 2019-06-06 02:38:36
So, you're sort of right, but don't confuse mining difficulty with the block reward. Those are 2 completely different variables.
Mining difficulty: Changes every two weeks to try and maintain 1 block every 10 minutes
Block reward: Gets cut in half every 4 years.

I mean, in a few months I will be approaching the amount of Bitcoin I would have spent on the contract anyway, and I'll still be receiving more bitcoin every day... Probably for multiple decades so long as Genesis doesn't go under, and Bitcoin doesn't tank, so I have to disagree with you.

spend the money to buy 2 cryptosteel wallets. Keep them both in separate locations (1 @ home, and 1 in a safety deposit box, or a trusted family member).

1. Your Mac is infected with malware that intercepted what the ledger app was trying to do, and sent your nano a different transaction request. OR malware that manipulated your clipboard, causing you to paste in the wrong address to the ledger app.
2. Your ledger app is not the official app, and it's instead a fake malware version (This happened with electrum-LTC)
3. You fat-fingered the address, or copied / pasted the wrong one (user error)
\ rule is always double or triple verify the address on your nano before confirming the transaction.

Can you export your private keys from the wirex wallet? If so you can import those keys into a wallet that allows you to set a 1 sat / byte fee, and then you can send that bitcoin anywhere you want for $0.01 
However, if wirex doesn't give you access to your private keys, you are out of luck.

The absolute easiest way is to use Exodus. Gdax is a good way too though I believe.
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:21:57
EDIT: Apparently there is a workaround for this.
I don't like trezor because if you want to put in a self generated seed (or restore a seed), you have to do it on a computer, instead of on the device itself, exposing the seed to who knows what. With ledger you use the buttons on the device itself to input the seed.

Yes the scaling issues aren't NEARLY as bad as some people in the &lt;insert alt coin that shall not be named&gt; camp are claiming, but if we're being completely honest, we're not to a point yet where millions of people can make multiple small daily transactions for negligible fees.

I don't think you are grasping what I'm getting at. Right now coinbase (for example) sets their miner fee at 0.0007 BTC. Right now that's worth about $5. But if 1 BTC hypothetically went up in value to 100k tomorrow, that $5 transaction fee is now a $70+ transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:16:45
Not going to lie. You'll be taking a bigger risk, as cryptos are more volatile, but the potential gains are huge. If I were you, I would definitely do it. But I'd risk a lot to be able to retire in 5 to 10 years :)

That was my first thought, too, haha.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:49:09
Market cap doesn't mean what it seems it means. There are plenty if people that acquired and will acquire their bitcoins for a lot less than 500k. So just because Bitcoin is worth 500k doesn't mean that the amount of money in the system is 500k x 21mil. Hope that makes sense

I hope that eventually, lightning enabled wallets will have a very very simple UI for the end user. To the point where the user doesn't even know what a channel is. They just have a "send" and "receive" button, and that's it. All else is handled in the background. Is this going to be possible?

This has been the approach for awhile now. I'm not opposed to a block size increase, so long as we stay under the tech curve, and it's stress tested to death on test-net before a roll out.

No one knows what the price is going to do. The sentiment in the community though is that bitcoin could go much, much, much higher than it is right now. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose.

@_date: 2017-11-06 21:26:59
That's missing the point... The use of coinbase in this example is completely arbitrary . Exchanges allowing us to choose our own transaction fee is a totally different subject. I'm pointing out how expensive it is to get a Bitcoin transaction to go through in a decent amount of time.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:17:53
Miners bail, making it profitable to mine again. This is how it's designed. The pow algo automatically adjust difficulty to assure the same rate of coins are being rewarded.

People... Use paper wallets for the love of God.
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:19:19
Yes. When you understand what market cap really means, it's easy to see how it's possible. If I had to guess though, we won't see a 1 mil btc for at least 10 years.
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:08:44
I understand this. But a ton of transactions are still going from legacy addresses to legacy addresses. I agree it has to be gradual, but segwit transactions have been hovering between 40 and 45 percent for a relatively long time now.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:44:28
If the transaction has been confirmed, you're out of luck. I doubt square would initiate a double spend anyway even if it wasn't confirmed. Sorry for your loss.
@_date: 2019-06-15 01:07:24
Wow! She nailed it!
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:40
You should never pay 5 dollars for a fee. That is ridiculous. I'd highly suggest using a segwit wallet like GreenAddress. That way you can get away with 10-30 cent fees
@_date: 2019-06-17 13:27:08
It already did fail.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:42:41
In practical terms, there won't be nearly that much, as tons of coins have been lost and will continue to be lost. I think it's estimated that between 3-4 million coins have been lost already.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:29:28
Would you guys consider buying hash power from cloud mining sites still a decent way to support the network? Like from Genesis for example.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:49:58
Thanks for the link. I will definitely watch this when I can. My thought though is that until the lightning network is more established, Litecoin will have a strong use case for low fee / small payments, while still being very secure. They just recently hit an all time high hash rate.
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:09:39
Cash App is great, except that you can't send to bech32 addresses yet. You pay a little bit more than the going price, but it's not so bad since they charge 0 fees, and will pay the withdraw transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:13:30
If you buy a large amount, it is highly suggested that you hold your coins in cold storage (paper wallet). Unless of course you want to use the coins in the near future, then it is suggested you use a hardware wallet like a Trezor.
If you're only holding small amounts for now, Coinbase is a pretty safe place to hold your coins until you're more comfortable with the technology.
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:01:10
Ya, don't sweat it. Almost every transaction I make I set to the lowest possible fee (1 sat / byte). It always gets confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:14:55
If I am buying hash power from Genesis, technically I'm supporting the network, right? (I'm also running a full node on my media server)
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:20:48
Unless someone comes up with a radical on chain scaling solution within the next few years, we will need one. The network will be brought to its knees on the next bull run when the mempool hits 500k txs, and the lowest priority tx in a block is $100, basically freezing all the average person's funds. I think that happening will hurt Bitcoin more than doubling the block size ever could. 
LN is amazing, but it won't save us completely.

I know what you mean. I think it is an issue though. I think it's hard for people to measure purchases in such small numbers. Like buying something for 0.0085 is harder for people to grasp than purchasing something for 8.5. not sure what the solution is.

If exchanges would use segwit addresses, you could buy at the mBTC level. But I see your point. Here's hoping LN will solve all issues.

This is normal and healthy imo
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:53:23

Definitely not too late. This party is just getting started. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:19:36
I wish I would have bought more than I did months ago as well, but I didn't because it would have been more than I could afford to lose. So I can sleep at night.

Really? Because the other day I paid a 28 cent fee and only waited 30 minutes. 
@_date: 2019-08-22 23:11:36
Haha... I promise that wasn't the intent.
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:14:11
It's not about what I'm okay with or not okay with as far as fees go. It's about wanting people to use the network efficiently. If blocks are full, and 90% of txs are coming from bech32 addresses, then there's a different discussion to be had.
@_date: 2019-04-07 19:42:02
Move your BTC off exchanges to make the exchanges prove they actually have the coins. I am highly suspicious that the exchanges have less ACTUAL coinage than what their user accounts say should exist. 
No one even has to buy bitcoin anymore for prices to skyrocket. Everyone just needs to move their BTC off of exchanges, and that will drive prices up to insane levels.

@_date: 2017-11-01 04:18:45
While I'd like this to be true, transaction fees are preventing Bitcoin from being used as a true currency. Second layer like LN will be required before bitcoin has a chance of being a real currency.
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:25:46
I'm not sure you understand how Bitcoin works... If the devs had the power to move anyone's funds, the whole point of this project would be completely moot.
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:05:17
I think 5 years is too optimistic. Maybe 10...
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:38:21
Exactly. And wallets that don't support lower than 1 sat/byte will either have to change, or be left in the dust.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:35:31
Uh, no, this should not be the goal. $100 to move your funds onto the lightning network is not reasonable, and if that becomes a standard, and accepted by the community, I would dump all my BTC for a different crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:20:26
Well I didn't support THAT fork. I wanted one based on community consensus. But still, I'm glad it didn't happen.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:41:15
This was amazing.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:16:28
Bitcoin is a network, not a company. The only way for it to crash to zero is if every single node turned off and not a single person was mining it. And that will likely never happen.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:02:05
Fees there are still way higher than they need to be... I wish exchanges would do a better job at estimating fees.
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:06:14
You're assuming that you won't be able to send 1sat/kb... You're also assuming that the block size is never going to increase, or that more efficient base layer scaling solutions are never going to happen. The protocol is going to likely change a whole lot before 1 BTC = $1mil
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:16:30
That's silly... How can they say you even own Bitcoin then if you buy it from them? What's to stop them from selling you Bitcoin they don't even have?
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:18:40
If a 3 year bear market happens again, I will be ridiculously sad.
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:25:46
I fully admit I was wrong. I wanted a consensus driven 2x increase, and now I'm glad it did NOT happen. Segwit / Schnorr / Lightning are going to scale bitcoin just fine for the long foreseeable future I think.
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:07:23
I think we will see 20k again, but not for awhile. MAYBE by the end of the year. But ya, trying to predict the price of Bitcoin is completely futile. But fun anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:44:15
WTF. So if you're not mining, Bcash CEOs want you to turn off your node? Wow wow wow.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:39:52
So, what's awesome about this, is due to segwit, there are more TXs per byte as well, so right now with the mempool empty, Bitcoin TXs are CHEAPER than Bcash Txs.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:18:03
The only way for bitcoin to be worth nothing is if EVERYONE stops mining it, or someone cracks the cryptography. Outside of that, bitcoin will always be worth something, and likely more than it is now.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:04:13

If I'm being objective, I'm honestly surprised companies are accepting BTC as payment with transaction fees as high as they are.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:26:15
I'm not too worried. With the major exchanges supporting segwit now, and schnorr and lightning on the horizon. I think the fee issue is done. Bitcoin is now scaling faster than adoption is happening. Mining difficulty adjusting too slow is somewhat of a concern, but I don't think it's a major one.
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:25:09
Alt coins are much riskier, but they have the potential for huge gains. Look at Ethereum's gains compared to Bitcoin's over the last year, for example... As much as I love Bitcoin, I really wish I would have dumped it for ETH 1 year ago. With that said, since I can't see the future, I will continue to HODL my BTC.

I enjoyed this, but I wish she would have explained the whole "bitcoin is stored on your phone or a usb stick" a little better, as it's just the keys that are stored there, not the actual bitcoin. I wish she just would have explained you can store your keys / seed phrases off of a digital device. As the way she explained it made it sound risky and not secure.

No... No it doesn't.
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:22:03
It's not technically correct, because segwit did not fork the chain. It was added through consensus.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:33:10
I noticed a few people seemed confused by the OP. Had I known this thread would blow up, I would have spent a little more time on the image to clarify that in the bottom section of the image, the primary big chain is supposed to represent the bitcoin core chain which is patched through majority consensus / soft forks.

This video is dead on. My only concern is about LN's UI. The every day user isn't going to understand what channels are and how to use them. I think somehow channels are going to have to be processed in the background if we really want mass adoption. Just my opinion though.

The top section came from bitcoin.com... Bottom section did not. The bottom section is aimed to humorously point out bitcoin.com's obvious bias towards Bcash. (Notice how in the top image, the Bcash chain has BOLD lines around it, attempting to make Bcash seem like the real bitcoin)

Been playing with it. Very impressed. The app being free, I'm not sure how them opening a channel with every user automatically is a sustainable model, however. The channel they opened with me they paid a 20 sat / byte fee! That's gotta add up if thousands or millions of users start using it.

You can come up with your own words (as long as the words are part of the bip39 word list), just make sure to make it truly random. There is a PDF somewhere with the list of words that link each word go a coin flip and 4 six sided dice. The last word is a checksum, however, and there are only a few words that will work with your first 11 words.
Also, even if you feel satisfied with your randomness, bip39 allows you to apply a passphrase on top of your 12 or 24 words. Using this feature is highly suggested.

Layer 1 txs will always be relatively slow (10 minutes give or take for every block mined). Lightning transactions (layer 2) are instant and practically free, however. The end game goal is to have most transactions done on layer 2. The catch is to get on layer 2, you have to make a layer 1 transaction. So keeping layer 1 transactions inexpensive is still important. Segwit is helping with this, and so will schnorr signatures. Eventually a block size increase will likely have to happen, but I think it will have to get pretty urgent to achieve the consensus required to achieve this.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:29:41
Typically the mempool clears up on the weekend, so there's a decent chance it could clear between tonight and sunday. However mining difficulty just went up, so there's no knowing for sure if the mempool will empty this weekend or not.

@_date: 2019-05-13 15:23:43
Yes, this is likely what will happen. I'd still prefer to manage my own coins, however.
There's really nothing stopping banks from making their own internal Bitcoin ledger, and then handing out Bitcoin credit / debit cards. This isn't ideal of course, but this kind of adoption would definitely boost the price, so long as banks actually have the Bitcoin their internal ledger says they do.

Realize this is brand new tech. That's like asking how can I get my friend to chat with me online in 1993 when he knows nothing about computers. The apps will improve, and get more user friendly. In the end people will be using Lightning, and not even know they're using it.
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:59:06
It won't always be complicated. I was watching an andreas antonopoulos youtube video once, and he talked about how eventually people will download a bitcoin app, it will have a send and receive button, and that's it. The end user will be using lightning and won't even know it, as everything will be handled in the background. I still don't understand how that's possible when opening / closing channels will require fee management, but I'm sure today's internet seemed impossible in 1993, as well.

The circumstances in which an exponential increase of transaction volume would be a GOOD thing, is when those consumer based transactions start happening off-chain (e.g. on the Lightning Network). The bitcoin protocol isn't designed to keep track of every cup of coffee ever ordered @ starbucks.

Segwit is helping, but it's not nearly enough to keep the mempool size small when mass adoption happens. I really hope 2nd later tech and adoption can stay ahead of how fast Bitcoin is being adopted in general. Because if it doesn't we will see $100 transaction fees or higher in the future.

If you're not going to use a hardware wallet, you need to be very careful, as just downloading a wallet on your phone or your desktop would be considered a hot wallet, and is generally not very secure. The other option is to generate a private and public key offline, and then send your BTC to that public address, but unless you've done your research and know what you're doing I would not suggest this.
With that said, look at ledger or trezor hardware wallets.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:38:52
Define rich. If you mean a mansion on the side of a mountain, never needing to worry about money ever again? I would guess you probably need about 50 bitcoin, and another 10-15 years.
If you want to live a moderate life style, and either retire early, or just work part time, I would guess you probably need about 5 BTC, and another 10-15 years.

Unless you need access to those funds now, I honestly wouldn't worry about it. The mempool will empty again and it will clear eventually. I always set my fee to 1-10 sat/byte. It always eventually clears. Usually within a day. Mining difficulty just went up, so it could take longer.
@_date: 2019-05-16 16:06:28
You guys need to chill out. This is good news. I installed the app, and it seems pretty cool, actually. I don't want retailers accepting REAL bitcoin transactions anyway, as the mempool is already having a hard enough time staying empty. Aside from a retailer accepting lightning payments, THIS is the next best thing. I'm going to use and support this app. It can only help Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:20:22
The mempool is quite full right now. The transaction will go through, you'll just have to wait until the pool gets down to about 5000 tx or so (based on the fee you included with your TX). Right now it's about about 55k.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:29:13
No way. The internet was way more evolved in 2002 relative to where Bitcoin is today. The fact that we still have to watch the mempool for proper fee management shows us how far we still need to go to be able to compare bitcoin to 2002's internet.
I'm convinced that in the end, the average Bitcoin user won't even touch the blockchain.

@_date: 2019-05-27 15:53:54
I would stick with default derivation path in electrum when using bip39, as it matches what ledger uses (and I assume trezor).
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:28:06
If you don't feel confident storing your own coins, then yes leave them on coinbase. However, I'd highly suggest doing research, watching AA videos, and getting a hardware wallet. Once you know what you're doing, it's a million times safer and more secure to hold your own keys.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:49:54
I actually think this would be a very bad thing right now. We want to keep the mempool small in size. I don't want want websites like ebay, amazon, etc, accepting bitcoin, unless they are using a layer 2 tech (LN), which as far as I know isn't quite ready for that kind of spotlight. Attempting to make mass consumer transactions on the base security/settlement layer would not bode well for the future of Bitcoin in my humble opinion.
@_date: 2019-05-28 18:17:18
If you're not in a hurry for your transaction to clear, you can pay 1 sat/byte ($0.01), and it will clear eventually. Usually within a day or two, but possibly up to a week or two.
There are a lot of very good reasons it's expensive to move bitcoin quickly through the network right now, but the best reason is that Bitcoin is not willing to sacrifice decentralization and immutability for scalability. 
Keep in mind this is still a new tech. Being upset about having to pay a few dollars to get confirmed on the block chain is like complaining that facebook didn't exist in 1992. Scaling solutions that don't demand a sacrifice to the security model of bitcoin are coming, you just have to be patient. I would highly suggest looking into the Lightning Network.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:31:21
23 sat / byte will most likely clear this weekend, I wouldn't worry about it. Hell, there's a good chance it could clear tonight.

Thanks for the response! Ya, I think something will need to be done about block size eventually. If tx fees are 20$ plus in the future due to 300k tx mempool, that would make Bitcoin unusable for the average person, even with LN. I find BIP 100 a pretty interesting solution, personally.
@_date: 2019-05-31 22:07:28
No one controls the mining difficulty. The network self corrects based on how many blocks are being mined over time. The goal is to keep it at 1 block every 10 minutes. 
One of the reasons the mempool gets so full sometimes is because segwit was a soft-fork, meaning that transactions using legacy addresses still work, but they take up almost twice as much space as a native segwit transaction (an input coming from an address that starts with bc1). Over time we should see segwit adoption go up, which will help with congestion. Right now I think we're averaging like 40% segwit TXs. I'm hoping we see that number get up to 90% or higher within the next year or two (I'm optimistic).
With that said, it's likely we will need a block size increase eventually. The bitcoin community is very conservative when it comes to this though,  because increasing the block size could potentially hurt the decentralized nature of bitcoin. I wouldn't be surprised if the only way we find consensus to increase the block size is an emergency situation. ie the mempool hitting 500k TXs, or something crazy.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:05:57
Any word on when we are getting schnorr?
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:28:46
Halving has nothing to do with it. If you have thousands of more people per day making 1st layer transactions on ebay, the mempool is going to grow like it did in 2017. Transaction fees getting that high or higher again is about the worst thing that can happen to bitcoin if mass adoption is a metric of success.
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:56:05
I hope having Bitcoin in a lightning channel isnt as risky as he makes it sound...
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:11:08
The network is clearing 1 sat / byte txs every day or 2 lately. So if you're not in a hurry, just set your fee super low.
Also, most wallets let you choose custom fees. Sometimes you have to unlock the option in a menu somewhere.
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:40:59
I still find his idea or letting the miners vote to increase or decrease the block size interesting.

BIP39 allows you to use a long passphrase to further encrypt your 24 word seed. So securely store your seed, and then choose a passphrase in which you can write down clues to remember the passphrase that only YOU would ever understand or be able to solve. Store these in at least 2 different places (Ideally one @ home, and one with a trusted friend or family member). Now if someone manages to get ahold of your seed, it doesn't matter. It's worthless to them unless they can figure out your passphrase (which they won't). Now sleep well.
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:47:23
Ya, unless we see 2017 mempool levels, even 1-5 sat/byte fee txs will clear sooner or later. 23sat/byte is a pretty high fee by my personal standards.
