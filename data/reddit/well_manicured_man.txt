I think hint to a good argument why BTC will not take over the world. 
Imagine you go into a super market that only allows BTC payment. You find some Apples that you like and check the price: 0.00001BTC per 100g. 
Could you interpret that price? Could you really get a feeling for the price? I don’t think so. Our brain is not designed to process so many 0s after the comma. And now imagine that you add more items to your basket. It would be very hard to calculate in your mind the total value of your basket. Personally, I think that BTC will not become an everyday payment currency because there aren’t enough BTCs to allow for prices that our brain can operate with. 
However, I think that BTC can work as a universal currency in the background and as a value storage.

1) you need to pay taxes or report a loss once you buy the alt coin with your bitcoin
2) you need to consider that bitcoin’s value changes over time too. 
3)The reference value for your taxes in the US will always be USD and never BTC

Well, the situation might change with the rise of China. Within 10 years China’s GDP will be the same as the US GDP. I estimate in 30 to 40 years China’s GDP will be twice as large as the US GDP. Latest by then, the USD will not be the world reserve currency anymore. 
Then crypto might be an option for the western countries to unite economically against China. Another possibility could be that EUROPE and USA build up a common fiat to compete with China. That implies that the west will not go on civil war and that our democracies can overcome their inner conflicts peacefully. Frankly spoken, I am pessimistic about a peaceful solution. It might very well happen that the west takes itself out of the game for 150 years before coming back to the world stage to challenge China again.

You are wrong. When you bought in at a relative high price like you describe above, holding is the worst strategy you can pick. Look into the XRP sub and you know why holding is a bad strategy. 
The exact opposite strategy, daytrading, is also a bad advice as only professionals can make a profit out of it and even they lose money with it. 
The only reasonable strategy in my opinion is to wait for undoubtedly big moments and act then. 
That means you purchase after a massive drop when the price is low and you sell after a massive pump. Fewer but larger trades. 
When you look at the price chart, you see that BTC is on a very high price level right now. You need to ask yourself whether such a price level is sustainable. I don’t think so.
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:14:44
Lol. Wishful thinking. Looking at the charts one can clearly see that we are standing in front of a larger downward correction.
20k might be possible again in a more distant future.
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:25:50
He is just questioning the unsubstantiated claims of BTC enthusiasts BTC would be on the same level as Gold it other rare metals. 
BTC might turn out to be great. It might also disappear as quickly as it has appeared.
@_date: 2019-08-29 11:32:15
Sorry but that is nonsense. You don’t know at which price the bears bought in and what their motives are. 
So far the drop was pretty unimpressive though and will be recovered within a few days unless the bears put more coins on the table.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:51:14
XRP has a great use case. The question is whether SWIFT can make its service good enough so that banks won’t jump on XRP.
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:14:29
I cannot judge. I assume they are professionals that know what they are doing. Not sure whether they really lost money last year. But who knows.
@_date: 2019-08-26 08:32:43
Maybe BTC has to dump first even harder before coming back stronger. We reached 10k so quickly that one has to consider that price quite unhealthy.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:35:32
Will today be the big day? BTC seems to correct soon. I know people will get all over me for stating this. However, I think it’s good when BTC does correct. We then will go back into bullish mode and we can look ahead. Right now, the entire market seems to be frozen waiting for something to happen.
@_date: 2019-08-24 16:08:38
Yes. And that money can disappear. What cannot disappear is cash or an investment into something concrete like Gold, Silver or a House. These things might lose a part of their value but they will still be there in 10 years after you invested in them.
@_date: 2019-08-26 11:17:33
That view took us to 20k and then the view collapsed.
@_date: 2019-08-25 11:42:49
But the green candle started at a much lower price. It is not the 10k USD as such. It is about the short time it took to reach it. This circumstance screams for a further correction.
@_date: 2019-08-24 08:55:32
I think BTC will return to bullish as soon as it has reached 7000 USD.
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:38:17
True. But there seem to be other contracts in place too. One expires on September 27, one on October 1st and one December 27.
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:42:36
It is possible for BTC to disappear because it only consists out of 1s and 0s. For example in times of fundamental crisis people will shift their money into investments from which they know they will exist in 10 years. People will play it save. Bitcoin isn’t save. 
However, I think privacy coins might thrive during crisis because Chinese middle and upper class might try to bring their money outside China.
@_date: 2019-08-30 14:17:14
Hmm, I cannot make up my mind about the recent price developments (in either direction).
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:40:31
Omg. The 10k price does not stem from 2017 but from 2019. And the rocket to this price took off in may 2019 and lasted 4 to 6 weeks.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:20:11
The bears or bulls? It looks like right now both of them lose money.
@_date: 2019-10-06 09:59:55
Well, you are giving indirect advise. First, by making the statement about your DCA, you try to comfort people that are in the red or about to get into the red.
Second, by making the statement about the price in one week, you are trying to establish confidence in the readers to hold and not sell.

Guys, I have a question concerning taxation of Cryptos in the US. If I am an unemployed (&lt;9000 USD income) University Student, do I have to pay taxes on my Crypto profits when I sell? 
My understanding is that I would not need to pay taxes on my profits.
@_date: 2019-10-31 17:08:12
Thanks for your reply. In the article it states that short term capital gains are taxed with the regular tax rate of that person. Since I make less than 9000 USD per year, I don’t pay taxes. I concluded that I therefore would not need to pay taxes on my short term crypto profits either. 
This would change however, in case my crypto profits are regarded as income so that I pass the taxation threshold of 9000 USD yearly income.
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:55:14
Constantly lower highs while the lows remain relative stable. That indicates investors expect that bitcoin will not exceed the 14k USD from June again in the foreseeable future. And if somebody assumes that, well why taking the risk of losing your gains? Since it is not worth taking that risk, you sell and that is how the mechanics of a correction works.
@_date: 2019-10-06 15:27:46
I am not sure what he wanted to say but it might be that the US (like almost all other countries that were heavily impacted by 2008 events) has not solved the fundamental problems that lead to the economic crisis. The FED literally bought the US time; time that politicians have not used well. 
In other words: A crisis of similar maybe even larger magnitude will happen again in the foreseeable future with the difference that this time, neither the FED nor the ECB have any gun powder left. Well, the FED has a little left but it is using it up right now.
@_date: 2019-08-26 08:14:09
Almost nobody would disagree with that but then if question is the price that BTC is worth. I think right now 10k is too much since we reached the 10k too quick.
@_date: 2019-08-25 17:17:21
I am speaking about both bull and bear whales.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:47:18
That is it? That is all the bears could come up with? A drop by 4.5%? I am not impressed.
@_date: 2019-10-06 19:21:23
I agree with you that the US does better than other countries but it is not magic. Everything has its price. It is possible that the US will have 15 great years starting 2008 and then 50 bad years starting 2023. 
Greece and Italy are a different story because they had to get bailed out by other countries that are not willing to accept that Greece and Italy put the borrowed money at risk with higher debt. 
I think the US as well as Greece and Italy have to increase taxes for the rich and decrease public spending so that they can recover.
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:31:10
I find it funny that you connect Bitcoin to world economic topics. Bitcoin does not play any role in world economics. 
This is pure imagination and wishful thinking. There is no fundamental change in the application and use case of Bitcoin and that is why it is standing before a major downward correction.
@_date: 2019-08-26 10:26:36
Not really because what counts is the point of time when the rocket took of. One cannot simply distribute a price increase that happened in 4 to 6 weeks over 10 years of existence of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:57:54
What makes your sure that end of the month is the dead line? Don’t you think this could lead to a massive drop today or tomorrow before the deadline arrives?
@_date: 2019-08-25 12:59:45
Last year it was 6k to7k around this time. Then it dropped to 3.5K. Something like that will happen again this year. It is just the way our market works.
@_date: 2019-10-06 09:22:16
Lol. So you bought for too high and are happy that BTC is dropping? Let’s see where it stands next week? Do you want to encourage people to hodl? 
I feel sorry for the people that get influenced by you and I think you should shame yourself for giving so bad advice to others.
@_date: 2019-08-26 06:07:05
No, because when the coins are in the exchanges, people can sell them immediately making it more likely that people will panic sell during a larger correction. If the coins are not in the exchange, people have to get them from the wallet into the exchange first to sell them. 
Op is concerned about a major drop.

It is strange. There is nothing really the bulls can hope for. Bakkt is already priced in and will most likely not moon the price from one day to another in particular when the prices are already on a quite high level.
@_date: 2019-09-22 10:26:50
Bakkt launch is tomorrow. No positive impact on price will happen. Then the bulls will run out of „hope arguments“ and price will drop within the next week. 
Of course if there won’t be a price increase the bulls will invent new reasons why you should hold and not sell. It is always the same game we play. You just need to ask who is making the profits. And this will be the people that sell before the bulls sell.

If it goes to 6k it will go down to 3k too. And if it goes to 3k again it will go sub 1k.
@_date: 2019-09-23 13:18:40
A likely story.
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:11:37
Where do you obtain the information about total market cap?
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:56:43
I bought 0 Bitcoin at 20k USD.
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:52:43
If Bakkt does not turn out to be so great, the prices very well drop to 3k again.
@_date: 2019-09-17 12:41:16
I think he is right with his assumption. The alt coins are increasing in price. This points to the market preparing for alt season and a bitcoin crash.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:44:20
I have to admit that I find it strange that there is basically no resistance from bulls. They might just wait to strike back. However, there is no real dump ongoing either. It is a steady decline. 
But then, crypto does not know a steady increase or decline. It only knows green candle or red candle. Consequently, this period will either turn into a green or red candle soon.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:24:26
Mark my words: price will never drop below 10k again.... *checks the price*.
@_date: 2019-09-04 10:09:58
This.
