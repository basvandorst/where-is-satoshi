What do you base that on?

You can never be too confident about bitcoins. I just think that way too many people are too confident that the btc price will go "to the moon". I just dont see it happening. Im sure the same people that are saying that, also said it the two other times the btc price shot up this year. Im just saying, dont listen to that and cash in. Before it plummits again. (my english is horrible. I know :p)

What is a weekend dump?

I dont know much about the Chinese exchanges, but I read that they just charge more per bitcoin. It doesnt mean that the chinese price for a bitcoin will flow over to the rest of the world. I dont see the price going to 334 USD this year.

Im not a redditor, whatever that means. Same for Karma. Im just giving advice. Take it or leave it. Your money to play with.
