Yep, that was me. But in my defense, I was really unwell the day I accidentally transferred 5 bitcoins in, then by the morning, when I had realised I hadn't done enough research, it was too late, and there was no getting them back.

But you can ban it's use. In places that don't have freedom as a right, this can be a daunting thing.

That's confusing. What happens if you purchase something with it? That's like trading some furniture for a car, right?

My research so far suggests that wire transfer is really the only way to do it. You get hit with big fees and the companies involved are ridiculously shady any other way.
