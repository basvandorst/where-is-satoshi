I've bought lots through local bitcoin (Birmingham UK) and never had a bad experience. I've always gone with someone with high reputation and a reasonable price and paid in cash.

Unix time the number of seconds since  00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970. Computers fetch them from servers linked to atomic clocks
EDIT: 
 computers use this to sync their times

Bitcoin Developer notes says that a node wont accept a block with a two hour time difference to it's clock
EDIT: 
The block time is a Unix epoch time when the miner started hashing the header (according to the miner). Must be strictly greater than the median time of the previous 11 blocks. Full nodes will not accept blocks with headers more than two hours in the future according to their clock.
Thus time must go forward!

You must have your own or be with a wallet that supports claiming forks. If using your own wallet download the fork and enter your seed / private keys for your main wallet and you should find that in your forked wallet you have the coins that you did at the snapshot!
Forks you might be able to claim:
Bitcoin Cash
Bitcoin Diamond ( you get 10x the coins with this one )
Bitcoin Gold
(Probably more)

Wrong block headers contain the time
