I don't believe any of it 100%.
I think most likely some freemason lodges have been involved in some truly nefarious acts, some in charitable and virtuous acts, and most just drink and play ping-pong (no wait, that's the stonecutters) 
More importantly, Satoshi's round-table doesn't have power over Bitcoin.

It's a legitimate question, but you've already stated it as a fact, so you must think you already have the answer.
It might make more sense if you state it as: Segwit provides a solution to malleability for on-chain transactions
@_date: 2017-02-06 09:36:59
I agree about hard-forking only as a last option. But segwit does not resolve the fungibility problem.

The problem with that is that if one mining pool decides it is advantageous to them to have a larger blocksize, they could pad their blocks with transactions in order to increase it.
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:57:31
It would be possible. I'm amazed anyone is still seriously considering BU.
@_date: 2017-02-03 06:34:49


'carries out a hard fork' = the mining of a block incompatible with old versions.
'majority version of Bitcoin' = messured by market cap, hashing power and longest chain.

@_date: 2017-01-16 21:49:07
or if you'd prefer, it's similiar to the anti-Trump hysteria
A lot of the allegations thrown against CORE (they are controlled by big banks) are as baseless as the allegations against Trump (he is controlled by Putin)

Yep, both coins
Bitcoin and PepeCash
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:12:57


What if they short the bitcoin price and perform the attack?


How is this attack possible today?
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:15:24
so another bug in BU made it not so bad?
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:32:07
haha I am just projecting as I've had a few ;)
I would think they would hold keep similiar numbers of transactions in their mempool, at least I can't think of a reason why it would differ much. But you couldn't make a rule saying if mempool is not empty block must be a certain size. 
I don't think an empty block is not really a problem -- if they are censoring transaction or deliberately denying all tx that is a problem. If you don't know what tx to include (timing issue), mining an empty block is better than doing nothing.... I think, maybe I could be convinced otherwise.
@_date: 2017-01-30 03:41:53
Dr Ruja Ver's statement on why BU can still be trusted:

10,000 BCH for a Pizza, sounds about right?

I'm hoping he posts some proof on his website: 
@_date: 2017-01-30 20:51:01
It broke consensus, attempted a fork, caused over a quater of BU nodes to be banned. It's obviously a major bug
@_date: 2017-01-29 18:39:54

I'm a pool, what does that matter?
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:03:32
Oh can you link to the PR and comments, I couldn't find them.
EDIT: Removed comment was a claim that the coinbase reserve change had a Pull Request and Peer Review.

Ok, walk me through this. 
Let's say I want to perform this attack today, I have 10% of network hashing.
First: I download the code change which constant? maxblocksize? to a larger size?
and then?
@_date: 2017-01-17 05:43:24
That's not my opinion
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:01:44
They require 3 BCH confirmations - expect about 2 to 3 hours at current difficulty
@_date: 2017-01-30 10:34:30
It's not quite a non-existent lottery. More that the bug occasionally gives you fake tickets.

Who are the "many members"?
Not that it really matters, we don't have to trust them, we can review their code on its own merits -- what they do outside of their code is irrelevant to keeping bitcoin a censorship resistant financial network.
@_date: 2017-01-31 09:39:40
Very weird, does this give more evidence to the theory they are actually running Core?

@_date: 2017-08-25 07:41:08
I'm not sure if he was trying to be nice, but Richard steel-manned Ver's argument and then straw-manned his own. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 11:50:28
I don't usually defend Ver, but saying he has no idea is fair enough. Most people have no idea about most things.
@_date: 2017-08-24 05:13:35
A disclaimer would prove it was real to r/btc
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:06:46
I think he might be saying that there is no such thing as 'the mempool' just a mempool held by each miner. We can't know if it's empty or not -- to do so would require another blockchain
That, and/or perhaps he is drunk... I wouldn't blame him at all :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:00:07
Agreed, but r/bitcoinmarkets remove most of the price memes.
@_date: 2016-12-19 02:36:05
I wouldn't have been able to provide hard data to back up that the DAO was going to be hacked, actually I don't think anyone did, but it was not a great surprise to many when it was.
This is not an innocent until proven guilty situation. If BU wants adoption then it must prove it has undergone testing, review, and security audits.
@_date: 2017-01-16 23:02:03


Yep, there is just as much proof that CORE is controlled by the banks
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:34:32
Fantastic, Also check out his other videos, they are all spot on!

he wanted factual articles, not FUD, conspiracies, and altcoin pumping
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:05:44
ha, yes they did -- not using them anymore 
@_date: 2016-11-27 11:33:02
I'm not against a larger block size, but I'm skeptical of unlimited's method for increasing block size -- it doesn't seem like it's been tested, and I'm concerned about the development teams experience.
@_date: 2016-12-14 20:05:32
If segwit, which even most rational big blockers think we need, can't reach consensus, how do you think a Hard-fork could?

I think Segwit will activate once people realize there is no better alternative, or a better alternative will come along and that will be activated.
@_date: 2016-12-18 06:31:26
What pisses me off about Dr. Ruja Ver is that he continually says we are all on team bitcoin, but then he says thing like
"CORE.. are working hard to destroy bitcoins easiness to transport" 
He says we shouldn't change to something that is untested, and may or may not work -- referring to segwit, but he endorses Bitcoin Unlimited

Top comment for this on r/btc/ 


I don't follow him that closely, but I thought he has discouraged alternative implementations and regular soft/hard forks. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 01:36:09
which is not literally saying rbitcoin is better than rbtc. I think he saying that rbitcoin lies are ruining rbtc, and until rbitcoin is fixed we won't have a decent sub 
As I said I have no idea know why his opinions should be important to me?
@_date: 2017-01-27 21:53:31


It's obviously possible with BU. I thought your argument was there are incentives against it?
@_date: 2017-01-30 19:57:07

In the case:

@_date: 2016-12-25 08:41:01
This gives people the illusion that they are actually moving their shitcoins off the exchange, and using them. In fact, they are just moving their shitcoins to another exchange and selling them for bitcoin, they then buy the goods with bitcoin. 
I sure hope they spent none of their $3 million on this
@_date: 2016-12-08 21:29:32
So why do you want a flexcap? The info-graph doesn't explain it at all. I could change the title to: Why I support Segwit activation or Why I support Lightning and layer 2 solutions. 
The reason I don't want a flexcap is I'm yet to hear a solution which can't be gamed, and hard-forks should be avoided if possible.

This seems like a strategic blunder by Jihan. 
If he blocks segwit activation on Litecoin for too long, they will do a UASF.
Then litecoin will not only test segwit, but it will test UASF, leading to higher likelihood of both on bitcoin.

That it is hard to measure, makes a hard-fork less likely.

We haven't reached agreement on the compromise called SegWit, why would we reach agreement on a compromise which makes less sense?

Or A vote for SegWit, more transaction throughput and lower fees
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:50:19
I don't think it's obviously wrong. 
Ripple and Factom are not currencies, I don't understand why they even need tokens. 
DApps seem too expensive to run for me -- very few apps need to be decentralized. Even if Ethereum does find a use case, I think it's so overhyped it is likely overvalued -- that doesn't mean it's price can't go up higher
Do your own research, but keep in mind the incentive of others to separate you from your money

I don't really believe most people on reddit, and even that would not be a meaningful sample size. Out of the bitcoiners I know personally, all have no firm opinion on scaling debate. Also none of them "use" bitcoin according to your definition.


Then PayPal is the winner. I think financial sovereignty is most important. 
I agree, I don't think Segwit makes bitcoin more decentralised. 


I'd actually be ok with that if it had broad consensus. But the difference segwit and blocksize increase is soft-fork vs hard-fork, opt-in vs coercive -- not to mention the other benefits of SegWit.

@_date: 2017-05-06 00:56:56
No, a hard-fork does not split the chain. 
However, to do a hard-fork you must have consensus. Otherwise the hard-fork fails and turns into a chain-split.
We don't have consensus.

Well if that's how you choose to define it, but I don't think anyone here would consider that sufficiently "decentalized." Perhaps I need to use another word -- anyway, a 5 node system would not be censorship resistant.

I have no way of knowing how often the majority of people that are against block size increases transact.
I have noticed that most people are for larger blocks in some way. (Segwit included) 
I think more telling is what you think is more important: Short term increase in transaction throughput, and possible price pump, or long-term viability (decentralised and censorship resistant) of Bitcoin -- the ability to be your own bank.
I am firmly on the side of long term viability.

Yes it is. If it was valid then this would be accepted 51% or not. You are very confused.

No, they don't see those transactions as valid, because everyone else is still enforcing the segwit rules.
If they did see them as valid, then it wouldn't require 51%, any miner could do it.

I think immutable means it cannot be changed, but I think I know what you mean.
Right now, a 51% attack could up the mining reward to 1000 BTC per block-- actually no it couldn't because this block would be rejected by every bitcoin node- it's the exact same thing with stealing from segwit, once it is activated.
