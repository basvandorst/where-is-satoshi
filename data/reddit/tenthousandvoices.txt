a private key isn't necessarily a hash (but you can use a hash as a private key). any 256-bit sequence can be both a hash and a private key. snowden's message was likely a hash of some other message or file. because it was 256 bits, you could use it as a valid bitcoin private key, and compute the corresponding public address, but that doesn't mean he intended it to be a bitcoin private key.
sorry if this isn't what you were asking.

uh everybody scared shitless about their investment and converting back to fiat

why? I wouldn't call the origin dubious, the government knows exactly where they came from. If anything, they're legitimizing and destigmatizing the coins. Having the coins before the auction would be suspicious, but having the coins after the auction is completely okay because, well, they came from the government.

it might have been the same person who sent it pulling it out again
alternatively, it really wouldn't be that much effort to write a bot that monitors twitter for any string of text that looks like a 256-bit key/hash and checking the corresponding bitcoin address for coins

why not? I've only had positive experiences with their exchange, and they're the only ones who didn't need any other information than my driver's license to start trading fiat. I also didn't lose all my funds last week, so that's cool too.

this hash has been all over the internet recently, i guarantee you someone just saw it and used it to generate a bitcoin address

that's not how hashes work, OP just used the hash if it were a private key to generate the corresponding bitcoin address. if OP could decrypt the hash, we would all be fucked
