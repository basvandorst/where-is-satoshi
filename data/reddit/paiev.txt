I hope you'll forgive me when I say that your linked material is too time-consuming for me to, well, consume right now. 
Regardless, I'm just searching for the root of the disagreement. From what I've seen, everyone agrees that deflation leads to more saving and less consumption, correct? That's the argument that people talking about deflation are making, and it's also endorsed by most posters in this thread, either implicitly (like your comment) or explicitly (like some of the top comments). So there's no disagreement there.
The disagreement seems to arise over whether this is a good or a bad thing. You and other Austrians believe that the replacement of consumption by savings is good, yes? That seems to be the fundamental difference. Everything else being brought up in this thread is largely a decoy.

I'm not sure if you realize, but this is *exactly* the same reason why people are worried about Bitcoin being deflationary, because it leads to less consumption.

What you're saying is that the fear of inflation (i.e. the currency having lower purchasing power) is what makes people spend. That's hardly a good argument for a deflationary currency.
