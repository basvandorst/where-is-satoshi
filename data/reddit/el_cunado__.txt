Really makes you wonder... thanks for all your hard work! I definitely would like if you kept up the investigation but I wish there was a way to know the true background of what is really going on here especially since I haven’t been involved with crypto during the time period the Silk Road was around but had always heard about it.

Coinbase has such a simple UI?

Crypto daily is great. I’ve been watching him for a while now and he’s been one of the few I keep going back to because it’s not always so heavy to watch

Publicly available information being parsed does not qualify as surveillance IMO

How does the thread have so many upvotes but none y’all upvote his comment?

I mean the article tries to discredit their product and saying it can be “hacked” if you implant a radio wire or something like give me a break. If the wallet can’t be hacked remotely without it leaving your hands thats the purpose. If you get it stolen where it ever gets to this point you are fucked in most normal circumstances (wallet debit card) so I feel like it shouldn’t be too bad. Of course ideally, as long as you have your seed your should be able to throw your ledger all over town and it not matter.

The reason it took 5 weeks is probably because you downloaded it all on the pi so it was IO bound and with its processor its crazy slow. I have the exact same setup but I downloaded bitcoin core on my desktop instead of my pi and it only took two days :)

Damn it came here to make this comment

Hmm I think mostly the difference is that there is some routing that has to be done with lightning bitcoin. Basically as your payment moves through the network more people may need to front capital for you down various channels as liquidity potentially decreases toward your destination node. So when sending lightning bitcoin a transfer can fail or if it does succeed there is not an actual transaction recorded to the blockchain (yet) until those funds transfers are later resolved and recorded.

So do you need to have an open channel to get the tips off reddit?

Have you tried leveraging the souls of your children yet?

I didn’t recommend it. I gave my own opinion and risk tolerance as part of a review of the implications of the news. Just don’t see their hack as that serious a security risk.

Yeah, the market is just so liquid and robust it can never be manipulated or flash crash over 15% while you sleep!
