and how will bitcoin and nothing else achieve that?
what's so special about btc that you cant get elsewhere?
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:54:30
correct me. Why do we need a deflationary currency? Which is not even a currency de facto but an INVESTMENT PRODUCT for speculators
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:38:54
good thing we have bitcoin then, we're safe from wars /s

Dude why tf are people including woz having such a hard time understading basic economics? You need a currency that has a 2% inflation/year if you want people to spend it. What matters is TRADE, as much trade as possible brings the econnomy up. BUY, SELL, DO SHIT. Just don't think about the money and it all seems like people are doing favors to eachother for free. Well, not exactly free, but money is a measure of one's worth(time, energy, work done, etc), So the more worth you have the more you can have people do for you.
If your currency goes up 10,000% in a year, then 50% in a single day, people are gonna shit their heads. Econnomy would stall. People would hoard the currency(in this case btc) and you'd end up with exchanging bottle caps as the new "de facto" currency because you need money to be COMMON and EASY TO OBTAIN too.
Bitcoin is a pain in the ass to get a hold on. First of all it costs a lot, then it's limmited in supply and thats A BAD THING. Why? Cause the first to have come to the table will get rich as fuck, the last ones will work for mere satoshis/month. Think of it in the year 2100 where 7bln people all use btc let's say, you'd have a big chunk of it being exchanged between rich folk and the poor would battle for the scraps. And right now you need wallets, cold storage, bullshit wallet adresses with 20 catchphrase passwords, you think people have time for that?
And there's nothing UNIQUE about btc or any other crypto currency for that matter. They can be replicated.
Why use one of 100,000 cryptos in the year 2100 when I can just make my own and hype the shit out of it for easy profits? This can't go on indefinitely. It's a bubble and it will crash, hard.
The only realistic scenario is one where corporations such as google facebook, banks, start issuing their own cryptos, offering it to stock investors, perhaps being interchangeable with company stock too, making it as easy to use for the regular folk as credit cards or cash. And it likely will happen, because state sovereignty is a thing of the past now, and the corporations hold the reigns of power, and the cherry on top will be to issue their own money, pay their customers and employees on their own terms, not the state's. And they will push it successfully because they have the marketing capital for it. Bitcoin is a free for all game, each to his own. Centralised organisations have an advantage here.

Different companies creating their own currency sounds like something the future could be all about, seeing how we're reaching towards the end spectrum of capitalism and towards corporatocracy. A future where facebook issues coins and pays its employees in coins, and sells it to investors,sounds feasable.
Or people could mine on their phones while idling on facebook, or some shit like that... where fb uses the computing power of the phones to reduce costs? As long as it reduces costs and gives more proffit, companies will jump on it.

dude stfu we had wars when currency was pegged to gold too. we had wars when currency was coins of gold and silver. people fight wars when they can't settle disputes on paper. you can fund wars regardless of inflaitonary/deflationary currencies.

@_date: 2017-12-22 16:13:53
You never heard of past performance will not necesarily reflect future performance? Especially in something like btc which has no earnings, profits, no shit to back its price up.. except for the miner's expenses but even that is useless
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:47:46
it's an open source code, anyone can duplicate the technology behind bitcoin, even improve on it etc. Bitcoin is a ghost, nothing moves its price except for primal instincts. Such a primitive thought, everyone wants it to go up and well yeah it goes, but it's like cheering for the first 4bit processor back in 74 saying that it's the best we can ever have and shit. No, bitcoin will become a ghost of the past, but the open source software that the dudes implemented first in bitcoin will get widespread use by whoever tf wants. It's all free. Whatever entity "bitcoin" is, it does not have proprietary rights on the tech. And when bitcoin will fall in price like domino, all altcoins will follow trend. Nobody bats an eye when a random coin goes bust cause btc is the popular kid in school. It'll be like when the pack leader gets killed, all will scram for safety.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:24:49
no trust involved if the transaction is done face to face I suppose.

The swede is right tho, btc is useless, you're the idiot here and they're making big bucks off yo stupid asses pouring hard earned wage $ into the scheme. gg boys
When will you realise the top 100 eth adresses own 40% of eth and top 1000 btc adresses own 50%? It's the most oligarchical social construct and e(con)omy ever, lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:57:12
who said oligarchy or communism are the only two choices? Also, communism is thought to be only possible as an end result of a very automated, technological society, with such a high gdp that the production is self-sustainable, therefore(some) profits get to be redistributed. In a simmilar way to how the nordic countries operate nowadays... nobody is left to die in the cold streets just because they made a dumb mistake in their life, why let a norvegian die of poverty when the state wealth fund totals 1trln $? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:06:38
Where can I short the shit outta btc?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:38:09
And while everyone is saying that bitcoin(or altcoins) cannot be banned by govt's, wouldn't this patent give US gov't the legal right to shut down all those crypto brokerage websites and lock up all the bitcoins stored in them? What's the % of bitcoins people actually store on their own pcs instead of storing it at a third party, broker etc.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:04:11
lol excited about the tech? there's nothing that bitcoin's tech has that you can't find elsewhere..
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:59:24
So do any other altcoins, right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:00:04


Which are?
Maybe there's tons of remarkable ideas for blockchain technology, but that's free to be used by everyone, what does bitcoin have that something else doesn't?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:25:25
steam solved this with that simple verification scheme..
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:25:14
How is having bitcoin in broker trader websites or wallets like exodus anything but centralised? It's one entity storing a shit ton of coins on your behalf, and when you trade, they take a comission, which is what banks do too? 56% of the daily volume in btc happens on the top 10 brokerage sites. There's next to no transactions between actual fucking people happening anymore. Everything being brokered by trading platforms... how is that decentralized bro?
I think it'safe to say by now that brokerage sites just pool all the bitcoins into one large wallet, and whenever people trade usd or altcoins for btc on their site, they don't actually run that transfer on the actual btc blockchain, they just record it on their site. The only time t
hey'd run the actual blockchain trade would be when you asked to take your bitcoins out into an offline adress. 
And isn't that what ponzi schemers do? Actually pay up to the people that take transactions out of the scheme to keep the confidence high for the ones that stay in. I don't see how this is any different than the maddoff affair or charles ponzi's shit. the SEC even read through maddoff's transaction archive and thought it legit, lol! Who even audits or keeps tabs on all those random coin exchanges? I'd be willing to bet they're the ones winning the most from all those price rises and noobs buying in at 18k. All registred in seychelles and tax heavens. Lol..

And can we all just take a step back and see that mastercard's market cap is 158 bln whereas bitcoin's is alone is  280 bln? and btc+altcoins more than 500bln. And it's actually a service that pretty much everyone uses and I haven't heard anyone complaining about it? I have my local(RON) currency on a visa card and I've had 0 fees on it, using it for the past 7 years or so. And an euro card with a 2euro/month fee, which actually includes travel insurance. And probably complains will be even fewer with the adoption of the instant payment reception at the vendor and blockchain usage. **Transactions grow by 10-16% each quarter.  40 bln transactions per quarter. 1.2 trln$ per year.**
It appears that there are only **10-15mln bitcoin users** out there, whereas **mastercard has 2bln users**. And there's a continuous influx of currency going into those mastercard and visa cards, wages, payments, *EVERYTHING*. Even btc users cash out via their services, lol... even btc credit cards use the mastercard and visa infrastructure and exchange to $ when making the purchase...
If one were to die and the other to live, which one would you bet on and why? mastercard/visa monopoly or cryptocoins? as a vehicle for currency trade... which is I think what all the whitepapers cite as the goal of their coins, facilitating trade? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:12:10
the patent holder can just declare he's satoshi? How would you be able to deny his claims? Mastercard has the power to make the dude into the actual original creator of the technology..
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:05:57
buy a 40-50k appartment, a 10-15k car, put 50k into stocks like visa mastercard allergan whatever tf. and keep the rest in cash cause emergencies can happen where there's opportunity for those with cash on hand, such as a recession.

Just because it happened in the past is no guarantee it will happen again...
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:59:00
Won't it become unprofitable to mine, and thus the bitcoin cloud network won't be able to process transactions? From what I understand, it takes 10 minutes to process a transaction now??? But paypal for example or same bank-same bank happens instantly. So how is btc gonna do cause from what I understand less and less btc will be mined, so theres no more incentive to run ur computer to mine btc.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:44:10
but it's actually what's happening and what everyone's intent when they bought bitcoin in the first place... Anyone buying bitcoin at 5k$/btc is thinking exactly that.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:28:09
then it's a product and not a currency, right?
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:45:48
I'm just asking, why does the market believe a bitcoin should cost 5k now and why did it believe it cost 0.1$ a couple years ago? The technology is the same, open source, etc. The whole thing, incl all altcoins just looks ponzi skeme-ish
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:18:07
no, source is bitcoin magazine, which has a stake in bitcoin prices going up...
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:01:36
Give me some legitimate reasons to use bitcoin for payments instead of just debit card... where is bitcoin better and the other is not? I pay everything incl bills, food, etc, in my country with debit card and there is no comission for any of the transactions. It just takes a swipe to pay with contactless, or 30 sec to pay online. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:13:03
So are all the other altcoins...
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:47:40
but bitcoin is not patented technology, everyone can make a copy of it loool, see litecoin etc. It's not like you're buying a license of windows or gta v online..
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:52:58
That's the point, you're using bitcoin as an investment, whereas its purpose should have been to FACILITATE trade and serve as a currency, not an investment product... You don't see large swings in the value of USD-EURO- and other currencies, do you ever think there's a good reason for that? If those currencies rose 1000x times in value over 5 years, wouldn't everyone recognise that as being a stupid inflation and dump all the paper in the trash?
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:55:43
Are you seriously telling me an old investor in bitcoin didn't generate huge returns? Just because it has no operator you can call guilty doesn't mean it's not fraudulent. See the SAC capital case.
That's exactly what happened, new "investors" pour 5k$ per each bitcoin bought into the market, and the profit goes to the older investor... It's just an ongoing "pass-it-on" scheme where you buy it for 10 and sell it for 100$ to me, then i buy it for 100$ and sell it for 1000$ to the next fool, next year.. and people expect this to go on indefinitely...
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:15:59




This does seem to be true, in TF2 there was refined metal which would be obtainable by crafting random drops... the currency came as a consensus. And for larger transactions, there was earbuds, max heads etc. But this doesn't explain bitcoin though, it's still a fringe currency, and from what I can tell, it's true and real use is to only be used to transfer official currencies over borders, launder money obtained in illegal ways, or buy and sell for a proffit.. daytrade etc., none of which **facilitates actual trade of goods and services like a currency's purpose should be**
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:50:29
it's something that promises ever-greater returns in the future, which we know it's rarely a thing. Very high growth must be backed up by something, product sales, userbase, something other than thin air and speculation. bitcoin's mrkt cap is 90bln now, which is something like 2x the yearly GDP of a 20million population country. It makes no freaking sense... 
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:27:37
You're just agreeing that it's not a currency then... but an investment gamble where everyone just wants to cash out into official currencies in the end..
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:29:38
A product or a service. But what are you buying when you're buying bitcoin actually? From what I can tell, the promise of a return on your investment... 
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:49:14
[I know you know](
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:33:42
well gold did facilitate trade back in  its days when it served as a currency. I still don't see bitcoin facilitating much trade... how much of its daily flow is actually part of exchanging currency for goods and services? and How big a slice is just daytraders, speculators, money launderers, etc.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:44:13

I'll buy your no-value USD for nothing in exchange, if you say it's worth nothing and has no value... why not give it to me? Because as long as people believe in it, that's enough to give it value. What's more important is the exchange of goods and services, the trades we do between oneanother. What currency needs to do is just keep an accurate representation of any given trade in numbers, so it's easy to keep track of and count. So then, the USD and any other currency serves their purposes, even if they no longer hold gold in reserve that the paper banknotes could be exchanged for.
It's the same reason why bitcoin's price is so high, is because there's someone willing to pay x ammount(whatever it's worth now) for it.  The USD and any other national currency will hold their value as long as people are gonna work their backs off for it, or mortgage their homes for an x ammount of $ loans, to sell any of their belongings for that currency, or to start a venture/business/travel etc whaever. 
A currency is characterised as it's ease of acceptance (what % of the people you need to trade with will accept x currency vs y currency) In this regard, the USD is still king. All international shippments, bank transactions, etc are done in USD!

spending crypto and buying it back in the long run only benefits market exchances like coinbase... which are pretty much centralised banks :) so there you go folks... another nail in the coffin
