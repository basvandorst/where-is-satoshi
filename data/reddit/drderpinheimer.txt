But as a proportion, its 9% right? (Or 10%?)
i.e. if someone invested $19,248.16, GBTC would have "0.09 BTC" backing that?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:36:04
This doesnt even make sense 
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:42:37
why does this affect the real bitcoin price?

Ive been holding strong but this has me a bit concerned. Sold ~40% of total holdings. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:33:35
Not totally convinced, because a bounce would be expected even without tether. You don't fall 30% in a day without a rebound (without bad news) 
I did do some research and see the tether is issued upon deposit. So then the question still remains, why chunks of $150 million? Maybe there is a 'legitimate' reason, maybe not..

Old news
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:40:00
This isnt the first large wall.. lol. 
There was another 1000+ wall at 12000 but that got eaten. There was also some 1500ish bid walls at 12600 and 13000 that got eaten. 
Large players arent that rare
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:10:42
You might want to recheck yours. At best, we're hitting slightly higher lows, and substantially lower highs. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:26:22
Hopefully the serious cryptos can soak up all the money that filtered into shitcoins like Dentacoin and so on while the price falls 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:15:05
Nice!  
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:44:35
It wasnt all that big. Bitfinex gets single orders of 2000+ that disappear in seconds. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:22:43
Thats a good joke 
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:58:15
Looks like the accumulation below $12,000 is over for now. Now will it hold? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:41:58
Its really not FUD. It's a legitimate concern. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:16:41
Yeah this is definitely pent up energy from sitting at 11000 for a few days. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:25:21

@_date: 2018-01-14 15:58:04
Yep. Anyone with even the faintest idea of how bitcoin works knows that bcash supports more transactions than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:41:15
I don't get why though. Bitfinex insolvency was cleared up by fees? Why invent a scam token to pump the markets? Mt.Gox needed to recoup bitcoins

Why isnt it English? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:25:03
Why does it come out in chunks of $100 million?
When tethers are created, is that from (a supposed) deposit of USD? Or is it from selling crypto for USDT that creates it? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:16:29
Yes, im gullible because I don't have 100% faith in someone who claims to have $2.2 billion dollars with absolutely no proof.
You're obviously sitting on some major losses right now and upset at people for selling. 
p.s. I happen to have nearly [1500 BTC]( Just send me 0.1 bitcoin and I'll give you back 1.0 bitcoin for your trouble. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:17:24
The most recent Tether release resulted in a lot of shitcoins pumping sadly. 
On the bright side, that lends credibility to tether IMO as if it were a scam, it would go 100% Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:28:16

Click the [text box in the top left]( to select a market. (Say, ETHBTC Bitfinex)
Then [select the button on the bottom and pick a time]( It won't be perfect but you can get the high and low of a particular minute - which should be plenty accurate.

Its not fearful yet 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:00:43
Oh ok I was honestly confused.
$10000/BTC is trying to hold but it looks pretty weak to me. If it does hold, its extremely bullish. And who knows if it will? So if you are planning on investing ~$4000, then maybe put a quarter of that in 'now' and wait on the rest. 
Being that the price is at this moment $11224, you'd be able to buy almost a tenth of a bitcoin with $1000. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:59:24
All I can say is, I hope its not a scam or we're in for some massive dumping
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:49:18

@_date: 2018-01-28 22:27:00
I don't necessarily disagree with a minimum fee. But right now it doesn't make sense, to me, to reduce the block size. Wait until we have a real scaling solution
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:40:59
Why do they use 0.09BTC per 1.00BTC represented? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 19:17:03
Because that's.. How it works. I don't know about the exact number, but it's certainly closer to 10 billion than 600 billion.
Look here: 
You can raise the price by 10% by buying about 10,000 bitcoin. $100 million raises the market cap by $20000 million. Even if you do some adjustments and say magically 100,000 bitcoin appear for sale suddenly at +5%, you still only spend $1000 million to raise it 5% or $10000 million. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:12:10
Prove it?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:43:47
Sorry, but you're the dumb one. u/Treeyent/ is completely correct.
You actually think a $600 billion market cap represents a $600 billion investment. Now THAT is stupid.

@_date: 2018-01-05 19:24:43


Which doesnt matter, because security matters. If I made a fork of BTC tomorrow, which I could, it would have no value (despite the same exact code and adoption) because it is unsecured (on top of other things)
Aside from that, I agree with you.. mostly. Now, in 2013 when I got in to bitcoin, I found the idea very interesting. Still, I don't think its capable of acting as a major currency because it's greatest advantage (decentralization) is also its greatest weakness.. and as a consumer, do I want to worry about someone irreversibly hacking my money?
Until that is solved, I don't see usage being substantial.

The point is this is nothing but a bounce unless the bulls can break some resistance levels.

@_date: 2018-01-17 04:42:40
To be  fair, Tether did hit $1.07 on CMC, which appears to be an all time high?

There's also other grammatical errors and inconsistent capitalization, etc. Not going to share where with the scammers 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:45:42
0.0005 cents 
If Bitcoin went up 100000x ($1.5 billion USD / coin) that would be 50 cents.
It's not going to be $100 - ever. (If the USD collapses, then its buying power will still never near what $100 can buy you now) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:46:05

@_date: 2018-01-14 17:29:07
It doesnt need to be near the actual demand. It just needs to leave space for lower priority transactions. 
No matter what way you look at it, either the fees, transaction time, and capacity improve - or the capacity goes up.

Bitfinex trades BTC/USDT. Coinbase trades BTC/USD.
There are suspicions that USDT may be a scam, so people are buying Bitcoin with USDT, driving the price up.
Exchanges using USD are unaffected, and not following the USDT exchanges.

@_date: 2018-01-30 01:09:12
Tether is their source of fiat deposits. Without it, they lose out on trading fees. And they have no insider knowledge. 
The risk is also on buyers on USD exchanges as the price will collapse if Tether is a scam. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:19:08
It looks like he took it and cut out the beginning... 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:34:43
After looking at it myself, I'm not convinced either way. It may be a scam, it may not.
I don't see a good reason for Bitfinex / Tether to do this fraud.
I don't see sufficient evidence that it is not a fraud. 
The $100m printouts appear to lead to tens or hundreds of smaller transactions (i.e. creditors?) and are not simply $100m being poured into the exchanges. This would indicate to me that deposits are held until some threshold is met, and then are credited in chunks. Maybe my analysis is wrong on this?
I also found it interesting that altcoins pumped very heavily on the last $100m of tether. This would seem to show that tethers are pumping altcoins. Why? If Bitfinex was insolvent, then they should pump only Bitcoin, as dumb money will flow into alts anyway.
And they are extremely suspicious, but it also seems possible that they act so oddly simply because if the banks they worked with knew what they were doing, maybe they'd be shut down. They claim to be in this situation because banks don't want to deal with them, afterall. 
EDIT: For anyone interested, here's the tether transactions that show newly generated tethers and the path they take. 
Following the "grant" from yesterday of $100m, they were then split into approx. 500 addresses

If thats what you believe, then clearly you don't think that a real scaling solution is coming.
The whole point is to increase the blocksize as a bandaid until a better option is available. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:47:22
Do you have proof that Tether is not operating a fractional reserve? Otherwise, it's a concern. 
Just because its hurting your gains doesn't make it FUD. You know what was FUD during the Mt. Gox collapse? People saying they were operating a fractional reserve. Guess what happened?

I preferred BCH over BTC for the first few weeks before and after the fork.
It's been too long now, though. BCH and all the other crap forks should die. If technical superiority will decide a winner vs bitcoin, then it certainly wont be forks that solved no real problems like Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:05
And really, Bitcoin Cash's market cap is total nonsense. Even though a great deal of Bitcoin are lost/forgotten/inaccessible, I'd bet the *majority* of Bitcoin Cash is actually forgotten. (On top of all the Bitcoin losses it took from forking in the first place)
This does concern me in one sense, because the fake market cap could possibly exceed Bitcoin's on paper, causing lots of FUD.

I don't know what that principle is, but it doesn't seem to apply - at least complately. 
Different cryptos target different markets, so it seems unreasonable to expect any single crypto to capture 80%. For "currency only" then I can see bitcoin exceeding 80%.

If the coins that the bots bought with fake money were also fake (E.G. not from a MtGox user) then the manipulation is not nearly as strong. However this would be difficult to accomplish (And nigh impossible with the larger orders 100BTC+)
So, it was almost certainly buying coins from other users, in effect reducing supply. Those users got MtGoxUSD back and couldnt sell coins anymore. This will rocket the price up.

You can't secure the seed words much more meaningfully than you can secure a paper wallet, though. Yes, you can do something like split the words over multiple locations - but do I really want to trust some other entity with my coins? If I have enough copies to feel secure they won't be lost, then they're more susceptible to being stolen.  


I agree. I think this is a great thing. But, in my opinion, if the time comes when the US gov't starts to seize assets or the economy goes to shit, virtual currencies are not going to be functioning. We're talking like a dystopia, right? Hopefully nothing like that happens. I would certainly be happy to own bitcoin in that case, or at least.. be happy to have the option of owning it.

@_date: 2018-03-30 14:38:51
If its fake, yes.
An example that you can see occasionally on Bitfinex is someone places a large bid wall at, say, $5000
the price immediately rises to $5050 as people think a big buy will raise the price. 
The bid wall is then pulled, and they market sell a load of BTC. Net result is a free +1% of USD. (Of course this all depends on how much liquidity was added, but 1% is a reasonable guess)
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:25:11

To me it looks heavily manipulated upwards. I hope that I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:28:02
My understanding is that its the amount of long positions on BTC (using USD) at Bitfinex. 
You can also see the shorts here
They're also very high - so lots of people going margin on both sides! 
@_date: 2018-03-26 22:37:00
Don't worry, they do this to all TA. I had a guy flip out on me when the price dropped to 6k, I said it'd be back to 8k in a few days. Oversold (even arbitrarily) is a damn good predictor of these spikes.
They don't get the idea of a temporary price change. You aren't saying it's time to buy; you're saying if you have money on the sidelines you can have very good odds of making a few percent on an ultra short term trade.

@_date: 2017-09-14 19:41:41

@_date: 2018-03-28 17:35:14
Hm, I know its "risky" but is PoS actually shown to be inadequate in security? The same could be said of segwit, no? 
As for ETC - I think it's more of a joke than Bcash. It really serves no purpose when you consider competitors like EOS or NEO. While they are of course all theory, at least they have development. ETC would just be an eternally crippled ETH with no hope of ever scaling. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:29:05
I don't think so. It's just some people calling the bottom. Completely normal.
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:22:07

This whale keeps buying, too. Another $9-10m
For people who dont watch orderbooks: there is a whale staggering bids today. Look right now at the bid support on $9600.
That staircase was also on $9800. And some other price levels. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:30:57
I do agree that doesnt make sense, you're right. Not sure what I was getting at. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:50:11
No, the best case scenario is it executes as a market order when using a stop-limit. Maybe there's some confusion over what a stop-limit is. 
A regular limit order is simple; if the current price is $9000, you said, "I will sell my 1BTC for $9100" and that's that. You provided liquidity, and pay no fee.
A market order is just saying, "I'll sell at whatever the best price is"
A stop order says, "If the price falls to $8900, I want to sell at the best price"
A stop-limit order says, "If the price falls to $8900, I want to sell - but for no less than ($8800)
The limit portion of a stop-limit is just protection for you. Remember orders are executed in the order they come in. So what if someone sold 5,000 bitcoin at market price, and their coins sold for a minimum of $1000 (from clearing the orderbook). Now your stop order executes at $1000 even though you said to stop at $8900 -- that number just tells the system when to execute your order - NOT the price you will get. Now if you have that stop limit from before, you will end up placing a limit order at $8800. 
Think that sounds kinda useless? What are the odds of the price suddenly tanking 90%? A lot higher than you think. It's happened dozens of times in the past. [Here is a 99.9% Ethereum flash crash.]( 
Oh, and the cause of that flash crash? Aside from a huge market sell and margin called longs, lots and lots of unprotected stop orders (stop orders without limit prices)
Actually, you can see someone had a stop-limit at $74 for example. They obviously set that order long before Ethereum rallied and still got screwed, but did a lot better than the people who ended up selling their coins for $0.10. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:02:40
But 2x won't get rid of segwit or atomic swaps, etc. It's just increased on chain capacity? If they intend to keep fees high, then it will push users into off chain methods of transaction?
I must misunderstand something major
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:14:20


@_date: 2017-09-14 23:59:32
Well, if we're just throwing opinions out there:
I think they do help sustain the price, as I imagine lots of miners sell on Chinese exchanges. If that were no longer possible, coins would be dumped on US exchanges and the price would drop until it finds a new equilibrium. 
Aside from that, I don't think they are very meaningful. Most of the volume was fake in the past / 0 fee bot trading, and now you can see they have very little liquidity and low trading volume. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:15:01
I don't believe that synchronous dumping is a sign of manipulation. At all. It's always behaved this way. 
When BTC rises, most rise exponentially.
When BTC falls, most fall exponentially. 
That's how a speculative market works.

So tell me then, how does it make money? I know others will place asks in front of the wall. But, that's only people who were already planing on selling - so they're losing, what, 0.5%? GDAX price is above BFX price, so as far as I can tell, it's not doing that much.

I did. You're wrong. It's not hard to figure out. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:33:20
There are bots that rely on slippage to make profits. 
Current price $3600  
Bid at: $3564   
Sell at: $3582. 
Profit: 0.5%. With 32 BTC, that's $500 profit every time it executes.
If price slowly drops to $3564, then the bid will pull back because it wants quick flips on slippage, not to buy.
Any proof this isn't what's happening?
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:28:20

Yes, but that's not a real concern. 
Security and protecting your stuff from people around you is something that everyone needs to worry about. Having the government seize your assets.. not really. Yes, it happens to a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very small amount of people. 


Paper wallet? Someone gets access to it -&gt; gone. Hardware wallet? Stops functioning or destroyed -&gt; gone. It's impossible to both protect your wallet from people while also ensuring you don't lose access to it. Relying on your own memory or ability to do a puzzle is not a solution.

Yeah that was dumb, but AFAIK this is recoverable for them. Really, no excuse for them not to offer some service to retrieve it. 
Even if they took a 50% cut, that's $1000 for them and $1000 for you for simply retrieving some coins. 
I wish I could help you. They're a bunch of cunts, clearly.

Just going off of how nonsensical the website description is, i'm going with "scam"
For example,


What? Bigger pools don't earn individual users more money, nor do they mine "bigger blocks" 
And the fact it's pushing a pyramid scheme makes it even more suspicious.
The concept seems possible, though..

This is what always held me back from investing substantially. Bitcoin really doesn't seem capable of supporting the world economy not only just technically in its ability to process transactions, but also fundamentally - a deflationary, non-centralized system seems.. not practical. 
I cannot fathom a case where people walk around with money that can be forcefully taken from them and never returned. It's not like paper money where you can physically take it back, or a bank account where it can be reversed. It's just gone. 
The whole, "store of value" prospect seems to be the most interesting aspect of it to me, now. 
Ethereum might have some value in smart contracts.
But I don't see value in virtual currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:53:44

There have been multiple larger drops in the past. 
The 2013 crash was recorded 
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:55:55
Yes! Many, many times.
I post[ this link]( all the time because it was recorded.
Thousands of ETH were sold at $0.10
And of course tens of thousands sold from $1-$100, and tens of thousands more in the $100-$300 range. 
There have been dozens of other major (90%+) flash crashes in the past few years on the major exchanges. (i.e. not low volume ones where a flash crash might only affect a few people)
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:09:22

@_date: 2017-09-17 01:34:03
Everyone who sold before the wall was depleted.
Imagine the wall was $10 million USD at $5000 (example)
That's 2000 BTC.
That's enough for:  
1 guy to sell 500BTC for $2.5m    
5 guys to sell 100BTC for $500k ea  
10 guys to sell 50BTC for $250k ea  
50 guys to sell 5BTC for $25k ea   
250 guys to sell 1BTC for $5k ea 
After that, any more sellers will get less than $5000 for their BTC.

@_date: 2018-02-13 02:11:33
Stupid? No. You're a full blown idiot!
JK, the order options can be confusing.
Also, if the opposite existed, a stop-limit could work as a liquidity provider.
For example, what I wish existed - and maybe what you were getting to in your head - was this: if the current price is $9000, I set a stop at $8900 with a limit at $8950.   
Basically it would say, if the price falls to $8900, I don't want to sell there or any lower - but if it then rises to $8950, I'm willing to sell. 
This would be more of a day-trading thing where you go, "If this support level falls, I think it will bounce back before resuming the downtrend. If I'm asleep, I dont want to miss the opportunity to sell high, but I also don't want to sell if I don't have to! (Hence not selling at $9000 before I sleep - I can't know if there will be dumps tonight or not, else I'd be rich)"

Well, if we're just throwing opinions out there:
I think they do help sustain the price, as I imagine lots of miners sell on Chinese exchanges. If that were no longer possible, coins would be dumped on US exchanges and the price would drop until it finds a new equilibrium. 
Aside from that, I don't think they are very meaningful. Most of the volume was fake in the past / 0 fee bot trading, and now you can see they have very little liquidity and low trading volume.

If you made $5000/yr thru work, and earned $10000 in trading crypto short term, you would owe:
10% on (5000+4325) = $932.50  
15% on (10000-4325) = $851.25  
= $1783.75
Long term I dont believe you'd owe anything on the crypto (at these levels of profit)
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:29:27
I believe most of them ended with nothing. A 10-15% increase in price made thousands of people lose all of their investment - some of those people losing millions.

@_date: 2018-04-10 01:00:53
You either don't watch the walls or understand what it is im saying. 
Also, I only speculated it is wash trading - because thats what the evidence seems to indicate. 
I've seen these walls a thousand times before, yes. This one is different. Namely that its been doing this for a week now. Clearly, no intent to sell. So, I would say with confidence, this whale is manipulating the orderbook. That is not a question.
What is a question is why these hidden orders pop up at the same time, and are consumed instantly. Newsflash: a buyer cant see that wall and know their 200BTC market order won't have slippage.  What are the odds of this hidden wall appearing and a buyer appearing within seconds? Extremely low. 
Oh, and if you think I am saying this manipulator is pushing the price down - no. They also have buy walls they flash and channel the price between the ask and bid wall. You can see those flash on the coinsight bid/ask too. 
That's why I think there is more to it. In trying to understand what it is this person is trying to do, it seems they are not doing any of the normal whale moves like.. temporarily propping the price up with a bid wall and selling into it, or vice-versa. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:54:50
Yes - I watched the order books and saw lots of odd behavior on the way up to $7200. Was asleep on the way down. 
Some of it is preserved in the[ bid/ask sum history.]( Notice the huge ask wall that keeps popping up, along with some bid walls. [This 6-8k ask wall]( has been flashing on and off for days now.
At one point, they put 2000 up for sale at $7100 and it sold, along with dozens of other large, questionable orders. For example, one minute the price would be $7125, then one second later there is a 200BTC buy at $71**20** from a hidden ask. That is not normal.

That's your opinion. I watch this market enough, and since 2013, to know what "normal" is.
Thousands of BTC traded in magical hidden walls is not remotely normal, nor would it make sense to occur outside of pure coincidence, or if its wash trading. 
I'm also pretty anti-conspiracy as I think most things can be explained easily. Including lots of people who claim that every wall is some manipulator.
But if you think someone flashing 8k ask walls for days, only for the price to jump $50 the instant its pulled over and over and over.. well, you really shouldnt be commenting on the topic if you believe that.
