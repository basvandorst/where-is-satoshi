Of course it is. But don’t trust, verify. Go and speak directly to them or interact with them and then ask if :)

 Not really. Better to secure the withdrawals process. More info is coming during the next days about anti-cheating mechanisms

The gaming experience also includes a gaming platform where you access the game. I wasn't talking about the games, instead I was making an observation about the industry and it's evolution during the last 10 years.
They create the concepts of:
However this is about to change as I'm developers working in my passion, which is a gaming platform powered by microtransactions via lighting network !
I also like to state that there are (experimental) tools to change this. And this is what I'm doing (or at least trying). And no, I'm not here for advertising or promote my project, I'm here for discussion and open to observe different comments and thoughts.

If you go to the other comment where I explain how gamer will get paid.
And if you want to follow me here or twitter to check when we are releasing the platform:
 
And we are partnering with a streaming platform where gamer also get paid with crypto for streaming!

Let's do an observation - BITCOIN +
The current gaming model and + 10 years ago.
Before, we used to go to recreational halls where in groups/alone play (retro). The pricing strategy was different and the more time, the higher score, the more value the user was generating... When at some point was even able to export that value from the recreational halls by exchanging it for a toy, console or other valuable items.
Now recreational halls are 4, steam-ubisoft-origin-epicgames (centralisation - power).
 I'm that type of user who got into computers because of gaming, and then I got into crypto because of computers. And I'm here to discuss about the current situation in the gaming industry... What a scam! We are being scammed everyday, and we have been used to this fraud that we don't even realize it..��
Nowadays, if you want to experience an ultimate game you have to pay for everything!! 
Value transference:
Game == pay ��
Skins == pay��
DLC == pay��
Bonus == pay��
But then, once you have used skins and want to sell it to export the value from the game there is no option. Games not only offer you the gaming experience, they also track data from your GPU, preferences, inputs...
This data has a value, and they are not giving you value for it, they are charging you!
Gaming platforms don't give you the right to have the full game, instead the give you a licence to use the game under certain conditions (usually to avoid cheats, but usually.). For more info read the steam terms and conditions.
This crappy and disgusting situation has made me wake up and fight against this industry ��. And the best weapon to fight is Bitcoin. Since several months I have been working in a platform powered with microtransactions via LN ⚡ where:
✓ Users get paid while/for gaming.
✓ Users can extract value from the gaming platform.
✓ Users can choose a charity if they don't want the money they earn while gaming.
✓ Users have the control over the gaming industry and not the opposite.
After months of following my dream I'm so close to finally release it! 
 No gambling, Fuck ICOs &amp; Fuck Scams

@_date: 2018-07-01 22:22:50
I'm working on a project implementing micro transactions via LN!!!
Get ready gamers!!!

 10 years ago they were using a competitive approach based in scores:difficulty ratio. 
Before, we used to go to recreational halls where in groups/alone play (retro). The pricing strategy was different and the more time, the higher score, the more value the user was generating... When at some point was even able to export that value from the recreational halls by exchanging it for a toy, console or other valuable items.
Now recreational halls are 4, steam-ubisoft-origin-epicgames (centralisation - power).
Using this, for example, via digitally and open source will generate value due to the fact that price is linked with time and winning (top winners) is linked with valuable exportation.
User can enjoy a game for free or in case they are too good at it pay to enter a score league every X time to get value/money.

This sounds really good! I don't think gw2 is open source but the I'm interested incentive mechanics
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:54:14
Lol,bwe are doing the same�� I just DM you
@_date: 2018-07-01 22:24:15
Use a Lightning wallet (Android)
@_date: 2018-07-08 22:24:07
No, not necessarily. There are different pricing models
@_date: 2018-07-09 05:24:58
I love to hear that!!
@_date: 2018-07-08 22:49:58
I've edited, autocorrections are sometimes though. 
However, my bad language in that case, do not take off the fact that gaming industry is broken (suctioning our value).
And whether you like it or not I am here to use the decentralised power of Bitcoin to fight against it. That's what I have been working hard during the last 4 months ⚡
@_date: 2018-07-08 22:23:09
Yes! At least we have that! I wanted to create an observation between the current gaming model and 10 years ago.
Before, we used to go to recreational halls where in groups/alone play (retro). The pricing strategy was different and the more time, the higher score, the more value the user was generating... When at some point was even able to export that value from the recreational halls by exchanging it for a toy, console or other valuable items.
