If this is true (which I haven't checked): is it really important for exchanges to not do it themselves? Please do not forget that exchanges have much more ressources than the bitcoin core dev team.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:30:25


Is this not only true for the wallet GUI which is almost never used? I think it is just a matter of priorization. If almost nobody uses it, others things are more important.


Also Satoshi came up with the basic idea lightning channels, when he described a channel for off-chain settlements as a matter of scaling. It still holds, that the on chain scaling is much more straight forward and only bring a short time of relieve but raise a possible ton of problems in the future.


This is extremely hard to tell. We can only make assumptions about the actual impact. But there is a huge risk, involved in on chain scaling, namely the centralization aspect.

The idea why on chain scaling is bad is that everybody should be able to afford running a node to ensure that everybody respects the consensus rules. It is more important to have a stable system that is hard to attack for adversaries than having a fast and cheap system that can easily be manipulated.

You are right in the sense that also segwit is in the end a block size increase and comes with the same disadvantage. But it solves current problems as malleability and enables "easy" 2nd layer solutions for the scalibility problem.
The problem with all scaling solutions that involve larger blocks is in the storage needs. There is a nice talk of andreas antonopoulos in which he estimates the need for such an increase if the real demand needs to be met (afair to be on equal footing with visa and co.) and it obvious that only a few would be able to afford running a node, which is bad, because the nodes are the components watching over the consensus rules. Just the idea that everybody can afford to run such a node makes adversaries to "behave".

I'm totally with you here. The difference is that Bitcoin and most "alt coins" have huge advantages oever gold like divisibility, easy and fast transport, secure transport and so on... so it is possible for coins including bitcoin to catch up with gold faster.


Absolutely - every coin (to avoid the word currency ;-) has to prove it.


You are totally right. And the scaling problem must be solved. I'm  just not a fan of the bitcoin cash approach but only time will tell, what worked. Just to make it clear: I am very much for a healthy competition between the crypto currencies which excludes for example tricking uninformed people into one currency.

There would be *no* confusion if he would just call bitcoin cash bitcoin cash and bitcoin bitcoin. The whole idea of calling bch bitcoin cash in the first place was to create confusion. And again double standards.


Why is Roger Ver than constantly spreading FUD about bitcoin, like stating in a public interview that the fees would be in the hundreds of dollars which is a plain lie or that bitcoin would be unreliable which it is another lie? And yet another instance of double standards.

This is not the point. When people hear about bitcoin and decide to invest, they want to invest in the coin that heard in the news about, which is most probably at the moment bitcoin "core". Bitcoin.com promotes / plans to promote bitcoin cash as bitcoin which will lead people to invest in a coin that they were not intended to invest to. Call it what you want or think appropriate but I think that the community should do something about it. *Also* in the name of bitcoin cash as it is in my opinion a totally valid (which doesn't mean that I support their technical decisions) currency on its own.

I understand your point. I have given all necessary information to the people to make up their own mind.

Is it possible that you are a newcomer to bitcoin? Nothing wrong about that - don't get me wrong. But if so, I would recommend to watch a few videos on bitcoin for beginners. I mention this, because I have trouble being sure if I got your questions correctly.
In any way: try to educate yourself with bitcoin as you should never fully trust a random stranger (like me) on the internet with your money. :-)
But let me *try* to answer your question: actually, there are no coins, so that your coins cannot be effected in any way. What you mean when you talk about your coins is simply a sum of unspent transactions that exist in the public ledger and that have a "target address" that you control. Segwit just alters the form of blocks in which these transactions are "stored". For Segwit "to work", these addresses must be Segwit addresses which means that you must create a Segwit address and transfer your coins to that address.
I cannot tell you whether there will be a problem with transactions that use Segwit addresses in the future but I also cannot tell you if there will be a problem with transactions using legacy addresses. But personally, I doubt it.
If you want to know more about Segwit, you might want to read:

The common perception is that that bitcoin is the "bitcoin core" variant. If you ask people which one they assume to be bitcoin the majority would vote for "bitcoin core".


Falling back to the whitepaper as an arugment is a very weak one. Of course the development does not stand still. So defining what bitcoin is by a rather old piece of paper is not a good way of doing it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:26:17

To be a good store of value, the currency must have several properties. The most important one is that it must be trusted and that people have trust in its value for a long time. This trust ist justified for bitcoin more than for other currencies at the moment because of the huge hash rate that goes into its pow, the time it already exists without beeing successfully attacked, the ease to set up nodes that guarantee the consensus, bitcoin having the largest marketcap, etc.

Furthermore, illegal fireworks are usually illegal because they don't comply to safety rules and therefore usually much more dangerous.
