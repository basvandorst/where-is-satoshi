As others have mentioned, you need to look at the details of the insurance in order to decide if it fulfills your requirements.
At Elliptic Vault we have the most comprehensive insurance on the market. We are unique in that 100% of cold storage funds are insured against both crime and our negligence.
We also never pool our customers' funds. Segregated wallets are used so that each of our customers can check their holdings directly on the block chain. 
We will be announcing big news in the next week or so, which will provide further assurance to our customers.

Yep, you pay a flat rate based on the amount of cover you choose. You will always be able to keep track of your bitcoins through the blockchain.
The policy summary is available to customers once they submit an application. As I'm sure you can understand, we won't be giving out all of the information on our policy provider details, but we will be able to make a redacted copy of the insurance certificate available to clients on request.

Hi, Tom from Elliptic here.
The example given is for a Liability Limit of £5000, which could potentially protect a lot more than 1 Bitcoin. 
In this example you are not restricted to holding only 1 bitcoin with us - you can store as many as you want, but our liability for them is capped at £5,000.
This Liability Limit can of course be increased.

We have considered a multi-signature approach, involving us and our customers sharing keys, however (i) such a system would not be covered by our insurance underwriters, (ii) it would leave customers still having to maintain secure procedures for their share of the private keys. 
Under our current service, customers are already covered against our negligence or misdeeds.
We use many security measures, cryptographic and otherwise, to secure access to the deep-cold-storage vault and to verify customers' withdrawal requests.

Our withdrawal procedure is extremely strict, and involves us verifying your request in a number of ways.

Thanks for the comment - apologies if this isn't clear on the website.
The cover is specified in GBP - in the event of a claim you would be refunded the GBP value of the bitcoins.
This is calculated using the Bitstamp USD exchange rate at the time of any claim. Yes there will be a short period between the claim and being repaid, but the exchange rate could move either way during this period.

Thanks for the support! We'll be launching other complementary services soon, so watch this space!

That's correct. While we'd love to offer the service completely in Bitcoin, removing the issues that arise from exchange rates, there are currently no insurers ready to do so, and they understandably want to cap their liability in fiat terms.
We suggest taking out cover for more than the current value of your holdings, to give yourself a bit of leeway. Also, our standard contract term is a month, so if desired you could adjust your cover level on a month-by-month basis.

The number of bitcoins to be paid is calculated at the time the monthly fee is due, so you'll always pay the correct amount in GBP terms.

Yes, as with bank deposits, insurance by a third party that you can trust is required.
Elliptic Vault provides Bitcoin storage services that are insured:
