The wallet.dat file is not there. There are folders named "wallet-backup" "key-backup" "rolling-backup" and "wallet-unenc-backup" but no wallet.dat file.  There are 22 .wallet files in my MultiBit folder.

It is WORKING! One synched, and the other synching now. Thank you so much!

Yes, I was happy to find it confirmed this morning! I'm going to take your advice and look into other wallets. Thank you for helping me.

Thank you. I had no idea that I was supposed to set the fee. I was trying to empty the wallet (it's on a failing computer), and I wanted to totally empty the wallet, so I just wanted to send as much as I could. Multiunit kept telling me "you don't have sufficient funds to make this transaction, remember that you have to pay a fee,"  so I just kept lowering the amount until it would send. Thank you for the link to the fees; I'll be more careful in the future. So much to learn!

Yeah, I sent .6 BTC from a Multibit wallet and it's been hung up for 36 hours. What sucks is that I can't even change the fee in Multibit Classic, so the wallet determined how much fee to pay. I'm beginning to wonder if that Tx will ever clear.

Thank you. I had no idea that I was supposed to set the fee. I don't even see a way to do that on Multibit Classic. My main goal is to empty the wallet, so I want to send as many coins as I can, but still leave enough for an adequate fee.

Thank you for helping me. I used Multibit Classic. I don't know that I was supposed to set the fee. I'm not even sure Multibit Classic allows me to do that.

Absolutely Would love to. I think you missed this part: 


@_date: 2019-11-22 21:44:50
Thank you. I'll have to give that a shot. Multibit isn't working for me.
@_date: 2019-11-23 18:13:04
Thank you. I will try those suggestions, in the order you suggest, and I will report back here for the benefit of anyone researching this in the future. Thank you again for your time and expertise.

Thanks. I'm "repairing" the Multibit wallet now. I'll try to look after it's restored.
@_date: 2019-11-22 16:35:16
Thank you for helping. I imagine the blocks *have* to be verified--I've had the coins for years and they've always been confirmed in the past (except for on and off problems like this). I am considering a new wallet, but I'm not sure I can move "Unconfirmed" coin to it. I'm just guessing I have to get these coin verified first.

Thank you for your help. I followed the instructions and there are 0 cones in my Electrum wallet, but when I look at the "Export Keys" option I see that I have a bunch of keys. Did I just lose all my BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:08:46
Thank you. 
I'm going to leave this public if you don't mind because it might help someone else later. I've gone through a few reddit threads about BTC that end before resolution, so they're no help to others. 
Anyway, everything is the same after Wallet Repair. 100% of my coin is "Unconfirmed." I tried to send it to the Elctrum wallet, but the Multibit will not send coin. When I put a valid address in the "Empty Wallet" option, the field turns red and the "Next" option is not available. 
I can't find an "Addresses" tab on the Multibit wallet. 
The Electrum wallet shows a zero balance.
EDIT: This might be good new: I found the Multibit zip-backup folder and there are 59 zip files in it. All the file names look like this: 
Though the last six are 2019 and there's one from 2018 (the last string before the ".zip.aes" appendage.
@_date: 2016-02-29 11:40:29
Thank you for that. (I'm still working on it.) 
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:40:21
Shit! The transaction WAS listed in my wallet, but now (after rebroadcasting) it's gone. Do I have any hope at all?
@_date: 2016-02-28 20:59:55
Thank you. Trying that now.
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:02:19
Thank you so much for your help. My wallet is still showing a balance of zero, but I no longer feel like it's a lost cause. Thank you again. I'll le you know if I get them back. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 21:00:09
Thank you. Trying that now. MultiBit.
@_date: 2016-02-28 22:11:14
Yes, the transaction is there. I reset Blockchain ad transactions a second time -- same results.  Still showing "the box" (1 peer). Still "not found" on blockchain and blockexplorer. 
By the way, I reset blockchain and transactions only for today. Would it help to "Reset from date of first transaction?" I can't imagine how long that would take! It's taking 10 minutes to reset just today. 
Thanks for all your help. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 21:06:55
Okay, so I "Reset Blockchain and Transactions," and nothing has changed. My wallet is still empty, and both blockchainexplorer.com and blockchain.info show "Transaction bot found."
Where did the BTC go?

I don't understand this post. Where were the bits sent, and why were they returned? 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:26:30
Thans for letting me know!
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:34:36
Not sure I agree. (I'm not picking a fight; I'm not sure I disagree either. I'm considering...) I'm always surprised at how little some people know about Bitcoin (and the scary part is that most of the uninformed seem to "know" that Bitcoin is for criminals and anarchists; they know nothing, and they believe the negative press). 
Is there some chance that giving Bitcoin to people who are not yet using it may attract more users? Just a thought.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:13:58
Figured. Any details?
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:29:58
I also found nothing on Google. How can reedit not know of this?

Upvoting this so more people will see obione88's response. Monster response!
