What peter?  Link?
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:35:31


This has nothing to do with my question.


And then went on to talk about how it actually is.


No because it requires trust in a third party. "Certification of each card's identity by the card issuer. This comes in the form of an ECDSA signature of the card's identity public key by a known card issuer's signing key."  CA's?  Really?
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:52:15
Oh sorry, no I didn't.  I am confusing this with another thread.
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:28:08


If any one of them wasn't safe then bye-bye all BTC.  So you still don't have an argument.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:11:56


That's a really good point.  So I guess BTC isn't good for day to day living.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:49:03


That doesn't mean it's good.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:26:09




Oh so it's probably not a good idea.


Yeah right.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:24:52
Well let's think about it both ways I guess.  I mean if BTC is going to be useful than it has to work in both cases.  If it doesn't then we're trying to force people to be connected all the time.
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:17:38
How do you actually complete the transaction?  I can't hand my bitcoins to my barista (because they are not physical things).  Do you have to use a phone?
@_date: 2019-07-17 08:30:30


Okay sure I'll just buy a new 50 dollar phone every time I want to buy a dime bag of drugs.  Or a hamburger.  Dick.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:53:15


SMS is not private and you would be giving away the location of this purchase.  That's a step down from cash's privacy.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:20:16


It's great.  It keeps people like you out sugar tits (see poster's nickname)


Yeah you have a point.  I was thinking of it as an alternative currency but it's really pretty much not, at least not in important ways.  Like you can't use it to buy something off of craigslist (unless you want to bring phones, meet somewhere with wifi, whatever else) so you really do have a point even though you're a dick.
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:50:10
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:58:32
Okay cool that you took all this time but you didn't come close to answering the question.  I'm asking how the transaction actually happens?  Do I need to have a phone?  The physical coin thing was a joke obviously right?  Opendime, how does that interface with the Barista's cash register?  No idea what Tangem is supposed to be.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:52:37


No they can't.  They have to have probably cause to search you first of all and they can only seize above a certain amount, lots more than a cup of coffee costs.  They can't take $200 cash from you (and that would be one amazing coffee) so don't be dumb.


So keep your cash in this safe place.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:23:37


Can you name even one?  The only one I know of is that it's not going to be around much longer and we need to replace it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:24:15


You have a debit card?  Why are you on @_date: 2019-07-12 07:22:01
So is there no option for people who don't have phones?  People who care about privacy and security?
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:20:39


Yeah but not *all* of it.  And you know that.  You're just trying to win an argument.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:43:38


Who said underground?


I'm asking about BTC dick.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:08:41


Great answer since my question was what *is* good for making actual transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:51:46


THERE ARE NO COMPUTERS IN THIS CAFE!!!!!  Why would you think there are?  Anyway I said this so many times.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:48:18
I don't understand how that helps buy a coffee.  You have to load the stick with BTC before you go to the shop and you have to leave the stick with the barista and they have to trust that it's not empty.  What is the use case for this?  Did you read 
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:11:54
Wow this is really dumb.
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:23:33


Yeah this is what the world needs.  Without it BTC transactions are all going to be traceable to the people and the place, and we lose all privacy that cash gives us.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:29:03


Yeah if the shop you're at allows computers and if you like having your life tracked.  But if you like having your life tracked why are you using *crypto* currency?
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:23:59


Yeah right.
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:24:47


If that's true then it wasn't meant to be anything like cash because cash is private and a BTC transaction makes you give away who and where you are.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:11:00


The one you just explained.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:22:54


So a shop that doesn't allow phones can't accept BTC?  That seems pretty un-cypherpunk.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:34:25
I wonder if a non internet device (or one that just doesn't have internet right now) would work if the transaction happened with coin that was synced to each one as of the last connection.  Or maybe if they're both on the same lightning channel.  Or something.  This has to be solved.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:32:32


I'm ready to adopt today, only go to places that take BTC,  whatever.  But what about my favorite coffee shop that doesn't let people bring phones?  What about privacy?  What is the plan?


Good, but you never will either because Facebook is stupid.  BTC is supposed to be a good thing.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:12:34


Who is being aggressive?  Are you a fragile little thing?
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:26:11


The only way to do that is to stop using solutions that give us less privacy like using mobile phones when you're exchanging money (which is always a personal statement) and then we can start brainstorming solutions to this holy grail problem.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:08:10


This actually answered the question.  Everything else was just you talk talk talking on unrelated subjects.
So you have to have a phone you're saying.  Is that correct?


Okay sure take over my question with info for other people with completely different questions.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:43:21


I came here asking for solutions, dick.  If you don't have one and you're still posting then you're the troll.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:53:25
Okay so how do we fix this major problem?  Think of all the transactions that need to happen privately in the world.
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:26:04


Cash is faster.  So no benefit to BTC?
@_date: 2019-07-09 04:49:44
What is bisq how to use it.  [bisq.io]( gives me nothing.  Downloaded a client that messed with package manager.  Site has no info.
@_date: 2019-07-12 07:38:47


Not sure what you're asking but I'm pro-BTC.  What is state coins?
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:12:49


Okay that's a good point.  Congratulations.  You made a good point finally.
@_date: 2019-07-17 03:11:18
Do I still have my hair in 2028?
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:22:31
Like 99% of humans.
@_date: 2019-07-12 08:21:17


I really hope it's not about the coin.  I want to find a way to use the coin that maintains the privacy that cash does.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:49:57
How do you receive fiat?  In person like localbitcoins?
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:24:06


You're the one saying you should bring phones (spy devices) to every purchase you make.
@_date: 2019-07-16 09:26:42
Okay so you want your location and identity be known when you buy drugs?  What do you think phones do?  Or will do in the future?
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:58:24
Repeating: What does that have to do with POS spending using a plastic card?

I already said that "is sold and shipped by NewEgg"
