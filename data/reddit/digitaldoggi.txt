So I guess the avalanche represents the Bitcoin price, and the rabbit is the average Bitcorner trying to ride the wave? Is that why this is in r/Bitcoin?

This happened to me 10 yrs. ago with Smells Bargo. They held 1000's of dollars in checks for weeks. They waited until a bunch of small charges came in, over drafted me and charged 80 dollars per charge, then that very same day they cleared the checks and deducted around $500 from my check deposits. When I complained and called them out they closed my account, sent me my remaining balance in a check ( more weeks later) and put me on check systems. F U criminal banks!

I'm not an expert but I'm under the impression that Bitcoin is an option for the individual people of Greece to hide their money from banks freezing all accounts, not a solution to the Government's cash problems. I could be wrong.

He's not asking for investment advice. He's asking about the future of Bitcoin itself. I'm getting tired of these tired, "Don't invest more than you can afford to lose" comments. That's the most basic, meaningless advice possible. That's like saying "Don't go in the deep end if you don't know how to swim", to someone asking how deep the pool is or how much water there is. Ok, I'm done ranting.

I use circle with a prepaid paypal debit card. Works like a charm. I would recommend Circle. Haven't used coinbase, although I know many people like it.
