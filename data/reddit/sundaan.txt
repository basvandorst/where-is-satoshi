How can u gift someone btc that dont own an account for an exchange? :) whats the easiest way��
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:45:20
You had 1.5 btc but couldnt sell some to buy a 50$ hardware wallet...? And now you're begging others go give you money for your mistake? ( assuming your story is even true ) ���� 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:37:14
Never cash out everything but ill consider when 1 btc  buys me a Home :)

For everyone going short there must be someone on the other side going long :) dont Think this Will have to much of a impact ( besides all the panic we've se en these past couple of Days ) 
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:21:25
After an ATH i usually refill after the correction, ( usually 15-25% ) Ive never sold once :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:02:52
Very... i might have gotten tricked but i bought a lot when i noticed... hope its back to normal on monday or Else I lost half a coin ����

100$ is not a lot. But If your plan is to hold for couple of years i say go for it! Even If btc went to 0, worst that happened is you lost 100$ In 5 years that 100$ might be worth 1000$ or 5000$ or even more OR less.. theres no way to know for sure, but its looking pretty fucking good atm! The return this year can land at 20x i would say its pretty hard to make 20x investment on normal stocks or Bonds so btc might allow you to get a quicker return but also means more risk. But again, 100$ is not much. But it might be worth something in the future :)

Haha true! Hopefully i can do that when 1 btc = a house! ;) i got a sweet deal on 1 btc earlier this year but unfortunetaly i havent added more yet. Will do some every month from now on! :D
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:57:57
But you put all of your savings on 1.5 btc without doing any research?... comon man be smarter than that��

There is no crypto called Ripple. XRP is the name of the crypto you are referring to, and it wasent created by Ripple, but is used by some of their services. Time will tell if many banks will start using it or not =)

Also dreamt of btc tonight. All my funds were on a completely new exchange for me and i tried and tried to sell off because it was going down 50$ / minute haha... woke up checked the price and could breathe again, wish i had funds when it touched 5.5k :(( 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:13:20
Me too! 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:44:59
Why would it dip? When someone sells, there must be a buyer. And even if he decided to sell 1k lower than current price, not very realistic for it to drop 40% 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:35:33
Its up 1000% this year. I see the trend continuing, so yes i hope so 2018 too
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:33:12
I think it might go down to 5.5k; just made a transfer from my bank to bitstamp hoping it Will be under 6k when i do my next buy ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:34:56
No worries bro! When has btc not risen above every ATH's? Just Think of that and enjoy the ride��

This summer we had about 10 sunny days, rest was cloudy or rained a lot.. So running something like a bitcoin-farmingrig would not be so productive I think... :( ( same in Norway where I currently live ) 
Saving up enough to leave these well-structured but poorly blessed countries when it comes to weather.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:04:25
Sounds very intresting. In wich country are you planning to do this in? And are you not afraid someone is going to steal the panels? Is it a fun project or are you hoping to get a decent return also? :) If so, may I ask what your estimates are? Again, very fun idea. Cheers from Sweden where I unfortunetaly cannot use solar power ;)

Du kanske kunde kolla upp om du kan registrera ett konto på Avanza och handla certifikatet "BitcoinXBT" 
Haft det sedan maj och är mycket smidigare än att köpa från en sida och hålla på och flytta / oroa sig över sina coins! Om du har några frågor är det bara att PM:a 
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:38:55
Okay! It might be from time to time but it cant be reliable because we seriously have the least sundays in Europe ( atleast thats how it feels like ) 
Doing something like that I would definately set it up where its sunny most of the time! ( haha obviously )
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:12:52
Im interested too:) Sitting on 100% btc atm and would be cool to know when/If prices suddenly take a quick turn in any direction;) Need to prepare with some more fiat money ready to buy the dip ! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:11:00
Very cool! ;)
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:16:20
So for us that held the notes before 1 aug, we are supposed to give information so that we can receive some value for the bch? :) 
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:20:33
I have all my invested money through xbt provider and bought all before bcash fork. I read that the observationperiod should be 3 months from 1 aug. But still no new info about what the Company intends to do with the bcash. If i sell all my certs before this hardfork do you Think im still entitled to whatever value gains they decide to give cert holders that bought in before bcash? 
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:40:08
Yes those are my thoughts to, but a friend of mine thought he lost entitlement when he sold off and bought back in two weeks ago, but i have just kept it there the whole time. Very eager to hear an official statement from XBT.
