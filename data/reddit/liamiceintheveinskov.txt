The fact  bitcoin has no intrinsic value in my opinion means little to a deflationary crypto currency. The traditional laws of economic currency theory struggle to apply to something as decentral as bitcoin, something in which value is derived from the users rather than the instituters.

Agreed, I think once we see a reigning in of the market in general and possibly the SEC's tentacles prying their way into the Ethereum network the shortcoming of supporting a full Turing machine will be limited.

That's true, bircoin is in a bubble right now but that doesn't mean it's longterm growth is limited, I just think Ethereum is 10x more functional and therefore will eventually be the new king.

Ethereum is readily scalable to 100,000 transactions a second where as the bitcoin network is struggling to scale to double digits. I agree Ethereum will have growing pains but not as massive as bitcoin. Casper should ease most of those pains.

Prep for that bubble pop. The network was too premature and not advancing fast enough. 7 transaction limit per second is completely ridiculous, Visa handles 1500 a second with the ability to handle 20k, soon ethereum will be the new king.

Anyone starting a crowd fund so we can get some lawyers to defend the network when the SEC eventually comes knocking? I'd be willing to throw some cash into a defense fund.
