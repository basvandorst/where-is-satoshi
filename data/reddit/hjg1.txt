Log scale is the only right scale when large variations are involved - more to the point: is the only scale that makes all 40% increment or decrements look visually the same - as they should.  In a linear scale, an increment from 1000 to 1100 (10%) would look much bigger than an increment from 100 to 150 (50%), which is nonsense.

Because you never know the value of X in advance.
In the two years 2016-2017, to keep USD under your mattress was a huge loss. Its price, against argentina Peso, "only" incremented by 35%, while total inflation was more than 70% (and investments like bonds gave you more than that).
That said, yes, nevertheless most people put a decent proportion of their savings in USD here.

Yes, it's the same. It's the (small, unknown) bank: Masventas

This shitty "news" has already been posted here, not once, not twice, but EIGHT times (nine with this one).
I guess this is informative, in the sense that it says something about the quality of this subreddit.

The irony: the people who get excited by this kind of thing is the same people who would never spend their precious bitcoins...

I'm 50, I live in Argentina, NEVER heard of it. 
It seems a small bank of the northwest part of the country (Salta-Jujuy). 
The mere fact that this shitty news is posted EIGHT times here, as if it were a big thing, is quite depressing.

That implies that you have an idea (at least some range) for the "real" price of the Bitcoin. 
Care to tell us which it is, and how you determined it?
@_date: 2018-06-24 01:59:57


I have an even better and simpler rule: when the price is too high, sell; when the price is too low, buy.

And here´s the three years chart (in logarithmic scale, as it should)
@_date: 2019-02-08 22:50:07
I have no idea what you are talking about. I don't even know if this graph looks optimistic or pesimistic.
Logarithm scale is just the right way to display prices.

I would like to know, of those things "you can buy with Bitcoin", how much is actually bought. 
Otherwise, one cannot deny the possibility that those sites (many vaguely referred as "some websites", "some service providers"... ) "accepting Bitcoin" are merely doing marketing.

Please see the context, I'm replying to some one who claims that the 2018 "is barely visible", arguing exclusively in terms of relative price variations.
In that (the OP) "technical" point of view, I stick with what I said: this crash was the scariest. 
In "fundamentals" terms (which I also value much more), yes, I agree with you.
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:28:38
See for yourself if it's "barely visible"  
The crash of 2018 was one of the worth and scariest, especially because of how stable the price were for months before.
@_date: 2018-11-16 12:22:42
The last graph is practically meaningless. You should use logarithmic vertical scale to compare "spikes".
Only with log scale a drop of (say) 10%  will look the same at all prices.

Not to mention that these are crowd-pleaser quotes, copied and pasted ad nauseaum, without verifiable sources. 
Enough of that.

In principle, one can send from-to any format. 
Currently most exchanges don't recognize bc1* as destination addresses, so they can't send BTC to them (no problem with the exchange receiving  BTC, though).

Could someone  give me some explanation (or pointers) to get the big picture about Lightning Network implementations?
It seems there are currently three different implementations developed by there different teams (or companies, corporations or what?) :  lnd by Lightning Labs, c-lightning by Blockstream , and and eclair by ACINQ. Is this correct? 
How do these implementations (and companies) compare? Are their nodes supposed to be fully interoperable?

Still Beta, though, and "intended for developers of future Lightning applications (Lapps) along with technical users and prospective routing node operators" - "we recommend that users experiment with only small amounts"
Good news, anyway.

@_date: 2018-03-27 13:38:17
Well, looking at March 2014, after a x8 raise, it dropped and it took 3 (three) years to recover...
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:57:05
Because it shows relative changes. Say, some month X the price goes from $100 to $150 ; other month Y, price goes from $1000 to $1500. Would you say that the growth was greater in month Y (because it was $500 against $50) or that it was the same (because it was 50% in both cases)? 
If you think they are the same (I hope you do), then you should prefer log scale, because then the graph shows the same increment in both cases. If not, you'd prefer the linear scale.
Only for small variations, log and linear scale are roughly equivalent and hence one tends to prefer the linear because of simplicity.

They are "all together", in the sense you mean: when you want to spend BTC from your wallet, you can spend simultaneously from two or more addresses in a single transaction - the wallet will take care of that.
