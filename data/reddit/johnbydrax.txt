I don’t buy the $1 million rationale. Bitcoin’s market value is still “meaningless” on a global stock market scale but if it were to reach much higher levels, most sovereign powers would implement policies to limit its use and influence. There is way too much at stake.

Agreed. I just can’t satisfy myself with answers such as “Bitcoin will never go extinct”. Same as black swans, we should always assume it is possible.

Given that epistemologists are still debating on the definition of a Fact, what it is to “know” something as well as how it can be justified, let’s agree to disagree. But thanks for the free lesson.
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:49:41
Good, then we both agree that the price of Bitcoin is manipulated. Btw, it’s not a claim, it’s a fact. 
Also, it’s precisely the ability of whales to manipulate prices that is utterly important and that will prevent Bitcoin from growing market liquidity-wise.

Dominance is not a guarantee of successful adaptation. Shit can still happen.

You’re cute. Technically and to some extent, we are debating but you are too dumb to realize. So long imbecile. We’re done here.
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:17:58
Dude, seriously? It’s so obvious that the burden of the proof should be on the deniers.
@_date: 2019-10-20 00:19:09
Take your profits bruh. It’s going to the toilet.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:59:43
That’s one dumb comment from one dumb trader.
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:37:40
Here is one: decentralized network with absolutely no rules
@_date: 2019-10-20 11:55:37
You’re cute. I checked your profile too. Interesting...
I bet if you could have any of my life, job, or investment knowledge, you would trade in a heartbeat.

He who laughs last laughs best.

Why not? No support from most world powers, high competition, dysfunctional patterns, etc. It’s by no means bullet proof.
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:21:55
Thank you Mr Professor. However, your simplistic “model” is based on two major false assumptions:
1) Bitcoin is not a zero-sum game (of course it is)
2) The value of Bitcoin will undoubtedly increase with time (la la land wishful thinking)

I love when people say impossible. Cute.

Here is one among many evidences:
And another one:
By manipulation I meant a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the Bitcoin market and create artificial, false or misleading appearances with respect to its price, liquidity or value.

Debating is clearly not your forte. Go make a few pips instead. Trust me, it’s a better use of your time, douchebag.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:06:18
True but centralized markets are now heavily regulated, which became a strong deterrent for corruption. Also, two wrongs don’t make a right.
@_date: 2019-08-29 01:41:15
So destroying corrupt decentralized P2P networks would also be a good thing... especially when regulation fails. No?
@_date: 2019-08-29 00:39:17
That’s cute
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:58:31
Sure, then go and check and you will determine that it is indeed a fact ie something that is verifiable. When I say the price of Bitcoin is manipulated, I’m not making a claim. I’m stating an undeniable fact.
As for your second remark, this is not an unsubstantiated claim, but rather a substantiated opinion.
@_date: 2019-08-29 02:05:44
I’m not saying that one is better than the other. I’m saying that Bitcoin is not the solution to the problem.
@_date: 2019-08-06 13:24:02
“...bitcoin got it is today without any support from governments.” - without any real hindrance from governments either. Don’t you agree?
Re competition, dominance is not a guarantee of successful adaptation. Bitcoin’s dominance will be challenged and if it can’t adapt, it will go extinct or become irrelevant.
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:37:34
That last comment precisely proves my point.
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:50:12
It’s not a claim, it’s a fact.
@_date: 2019-12-14 03:39:06
I can safely say that Bitcoin will never reach the 21 million coins limit
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:08:16
More propaganda for a collective hallucination
@_date: 2019-09-22 22:58:35
The last round was at $47B in January. $10-15B is a guess, which doesn’t mean anything unless they IPO at this valuation.
