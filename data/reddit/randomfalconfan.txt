what do you mean by miners spam the network with low-priced transactions? Are they essentially trading low denominations of btc between eachother?

I guess I don't understand how increasing block size increases centralization? Plus, isn't core currently under attack as is with the current block size? 
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:15:35
see comment below.. erghh... above? it's due to the increased block size.

as a business owner why would I accept bitcoin when this is the mindset?
@_date: 2017-10-11 13:14:06
does core plan on increasing block size? as a business owner who would like to accept bitcoin. the only reason I don't is high transaction fees and the time it takes to process transactions (things I've heard from other people who accept btc).

I subbed to r/btc when I first started getting into btc and after being away for sometime I've realized the posts/articles there are biased towards seg2x. The only thing I really care about is increasing the block size, which from what I have gathered is what seg2x is trying to do.
