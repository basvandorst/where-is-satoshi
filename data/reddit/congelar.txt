You ask for sources because you're willing to have a strong opinion about something you haven't even _bothered_ to research on your own.  This is literally the only reason I'm in this conversation,  as part of an effort to browbeat you into realizing this.
The source is [the indictment](  Again,  _not hard to find_.


Holy shit.  I honestly hope life affords you an opportunity to live in your "libertarian paradise."  When _your_ identity is stolen and sold on the black market,  I hope you remember this idealism of yours.


Your inability to reason correctly is no reason for you to stay.  You can leave this land of oppression any time you like,  while you're going,  think about why the rest of us willing stay in a place where the government uses violence to interfere with "legitimate commerce."  If you can't draw any inferences from that,  then you're hopeless.

No the difference is I realize Ulbricht wasn't _required_ to run Silk Road.  That was a _choice_ he made,  and the _consequences_ would be obvious to any functioning individual.


False moral equivalence.  Do I have human rights even though I'm in _your hypothetical_ cage?  Do I have access to the courts and a right to file unlimited appeals?  Are there laws which govern _your_ actions?  Did I actually break the law?
It's not rational to compare the two,  but since you seem to like this game of flawed moral dichotomy let me give you one:  Would you rather be in a cage for committing a crime or assassinated for it?
You're either a troll or you endeavor to live like one.  Fortunately,  most of the world does not suffer your delusions.

That's an incredibly narrow view,  one almost designed to arrive at your desired conclusion.  You don't think the exposure of his database would effectively end his business by destroying his credibility?  If his information wasn't to be directly exposed,  why else would he fear the violence of the state to such an extent that he'd be willing to kill these individuals over it.
Wouldn't it be enough to hire someone to kidnap them and then _recover_ the stolen information?  Wouldn't that be smarter?  Killing someone doesn't guarantee that the release _wouldn't_ happen.  
Killing them serves two purposes:  need for vendetta and to send a message to everyone else who might try the same extortion.


Your ethics are exceptionally weak if you feel confident in that.

Encryption and hashing are two different things.  Further,  if SHA is broken then only SHA is broken..  it may or may not imply other breaks for similar hashing algorithms.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:08:39


Violent actors in the abstract.  The government wasn't going to _kill_ Ulbright,  just put him in jail.  Your reasoning is bordering on the insane.


He was.


The government had 7 other charges that could put him in jail for 20 to life.  They simply decided not to complicate their prosecution with it.


Again,  you're wrong.  You keep using "as far as I know" while sitting on the internet.  Instead of using your simplistic ethics combined with weak and incomplete understandings of the truth to defend the indefensible,  you might take some time to actually read any of the _reams_ of documentation available about this case and hopefully come to a more reasonable conclusion about reality.
Good day,  sir.

Hardly..  as new encryption and hash functions are developed,  they are integrated into our current systems.  Things like TLS and SSL are _designed_ from the ground up to support this level of "forward security."  Further,  it's also highly likely that these new constructions will use techniques that are wholly novel from the current set of techniques;  and most likely with "post-quantum cryptography" in mind.
Bitcoin is in much worse shape because so much of the system is dependent upon the peculiarities of the SHA function that was selected,  including the "chain-of-trust" that verifies the current blockchain and all _prior_ transactions.

That's just the figure currently.  If someone got it in their mind to simply mine coins and then throw them away,  you could eat the currency away from the inside.  Not sure it would be worth it to anyone,  but considering that "altcoin competition" was never really considered when the system was designed,  it might actually become a factor.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:41:03


Nope,  your understanding is misguided.
[This isn't exactly hard to find](

That included Money Laundering, Computer Hacking and Conspiracy to Traffic in all manner of substances not strictly limited to narcotics.  Crimes that Ulbricht himself took part in as well as attempting to arrange six assassinations.
Unless you think selling Fake IDs and Poisons is "simple voluntary trade" that the state should completely ignore you need to take your blinders off and actually confront some information that will challenge your predetermined point of view.


No..  that's the disconnect _you're_ having.  You assume the society you live in comes to us by human nature.  I've been to parts of the world where anarchy has broken out for one reason or another,  and I can tell you..  I'm happy to live in a land of laws and that they are actually enforced.. and that "the cage" is a downright _awesome_ alternative to some of the aftermath I've witnessed.

You're fucking joking,  right?  The murders were over money stolen or extorted from DPR.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:19:20


Provided you can get all the miners to actually run that fork outside of an immediate emergency?  I always assumed that would be the biggest issue,  but aside from that,  something I haven't researched is how do you secure prior transactions on the blockchain?
_If_ they're going to change the PoW they need to do it well before SHA is vulnerable.

70% of firefighters are _volunteer_,  and 1% of our population isn't on fire at any one time.

Yea,  they really did a cracker-jack job of getting to those _really_ responsible for the crisis.  [No,  wait,  they just went after the little guys](
What do you expect from weak regulatory agencies?
@_date: 2018-03-12 06:46:23


So, at 1" somewhere between a safety factor of 2.6 and 0.8?
EDIT, per At 1.5" then, safety factor is from 6.0 to 2.0.

The part that's income.  Like _all_ taxes.

Also..  make a copy of that key;  because if you lose it,  that money and all potential unrealized value is forever destroyed.  USB/CD is a decent choice,  but they are digital and _will_ degrade over time and lose data -- be sure to use something like parchive to ensure that you have enough redundancy that you can recover the key should you need it in the future.

Why?  The [grand jury indictment]( isn't a very long document;  and it paints a far different picture from "some dude getting high in SF."

Depends how old you are.
