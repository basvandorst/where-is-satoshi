On the other hand be alt coins get created, market is pumped and dumped by whales, people lose faith.
Lots of factors on both sides. So why again are people assuming it will always go up? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:47:34
You'll notice that every time the price tanks the mods happen to find something more "interesting". My guess is that it is a poorly disguised attempt at controlling panic selling. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:57:50
He's wrong. It might stay the same. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:16:07
And lose a lot investing for longer. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:26:00
People tell this because they've got a personal interest in others hodling. Nothing else to it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:39:20
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:14:43
Yeah, ironically bitcoin has really given me an appreciation of what laws and regulations do in the financial landscape. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:58:15
They used it to short bitcoin. Smart.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:05:04
1.6B made up new money is certainly enough to launch the market evaluation to the moon. Kind of what exactly happened... 
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:50:29
Pretty sure that's always true when the price goes down. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:37:46


Beats me. The entire interaction with exchanges is shaddy af.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:24:59
It is, it's such a primal threat response you can make a nature documentary about it.
Reminds me of the famous quote: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it". 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:13:50
There is lots and lots and lots of equally if not much more ingenious communication and cryptographic protocols that are already being used in lots and lots and lots of ways. Yet no one gives a single fuck other than the developers using them because why should they? This is getting into the weeds of how a particular software is implemented. The obsession with blockchain is nothing but hype fueled by greed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:11:15
Probably nothing fresh about these but these are the main problems I see:
* No clean way to buy it. The exchanges are barely regulated and untrustworthy and constantly doing scummy things to solidify that image. E.g. shutting down when the market starts to go down, getting hacked, locking accounts, straight up disappearing, having massive price discrepancies, eating massive profits of exchanges, ridiculous fees, weeks to get set up. I never appreciated how banks conduct themselves till I dealt with bitcoin exchanges.
* Unusable as a currency. Caused by volatility and in turn lack of adoption. This problem seems to be getting worse as well.
* Unacceptable fees and transaction processing times. Some promise of this getting better in the future.
*  Zero consumer protection. No way to protect yourself or recover your loses if your computer got hacked or you lost the USB your private keys were in... even if that contained your life savings. Very fragile.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:45:42
They've minted a shit load (nearly 2b) of coins that they claim are "usd backed" with no proof that that's actually the case. This coin is then used to buy shit loads of other cryptos driving the entire market valuation through the roof. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:56:24


In other words, you are completely clueless. At least you are honest.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:49:07
If the trick is to keep going back in time,  every time bitcoin crashes, to make it look good then this will work even if the price crashes to $1. Unfortunately that is of no use to everyone who didn't buy at that level... Which is almost everyone. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:37:40
Only a moron would've bought in December though.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:20:12
Yeah I'm sure the whales are done making all the money they want now. It's all in the past. Utopia begins now.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:46:38
Not to mention the wildly different rates on different exchanges and the ridiculously high fees. While I can appreciate the concept and the technology but these exchanges just feel so scummy and unprotected. In a way bitcoin has slightly made me appreciate the existing laws, monetary system and it's robustness
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:03:38
What the fuck just happened? Dropping like a rock.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:02:19
Look into tether. Doesn't look like good news at all. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:00:50
Psst psst... tether. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:09:32


Sounds fucking terrible tbo.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:14:38
I am being sarcastic since if they short sold today they would've made a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:34:43
Aka CA on forms
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:20:39
Stop living in the past.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:55:28
And that's exactly what the people try to divert the discussion from. Currency is the usecase it originally set out to tackle.
@_date: 2018-01-16 05:35:39
"Store of value" argument has always been about diverting the discussion away from major issues with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:40:22
Am Canadian and have to agree. The condescending we are better than US attitude is nauseating and prevalent. Ironically Canada would be nothing without US. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:08:36
That was like last year in crypto time. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:44:46
Lmao, noticed that too huh? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:52:14
If I say I have 2 billion dollars worth of coin called fether, would you buy it without proof? Would the burden of proof be on you to prove I do not have the money. No, that's not how this works. The seller has to prove the value. They haven't and everything points to fraud. If you wanna eat it up, go right ahead. Lots of gullible ppl do just that. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:58:57
"This is good for bitcoin" personified.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:40:16
Wow, that explains so much. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:17:34
Fear, uncertainty and doubt are very natural human reactions to fluctuations of months of income in minutes. I don't think everyone here is a shill. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:01:31
Yeah if such a massive portion of everyday people have already invested directly in something, as an investor you are really late to the party.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:23:37
At this time only one is pinned. Mods are pissy at the wrong think going on in these threads. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:56
What "hodl to da moon" not doing it for you?
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:42:27
The thing is, the technology really isn't that great. It's problems are obvious and I highly doubt anyone fully knows the system other than a minute fraction of developers anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:28:23
Can people make excuses when faced with failure? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:46:13
You would, you just don't have the honesty or self awareness to admit it. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:21:54
Because it is starting to matter at a scale where they give a shit.
US government has decimated entire countries, hanged leaders and killed hundreds of thousands for daring to challenge the petro dollar. You think they'll just passively accept bitcoin subverting their power? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:45:06
Violence goes against my ideas but if someone offered me a billion dollars to do so I'd gladly skin you alive. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 14:02:40
Did your mother tell you that?
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:43:32
Dude, zoom in! Gone up 10% in a day!

So 0?

If you think this is what accounts for to 80x price increase, you are deluding yourself. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:11:34
Actually they are being actively investigated right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:50:12
Must be bad for bitcoin judging by the lack of posts about it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:36:15
Yes, it could be worth nothing if turns out they've been printing more than they have. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:25:04
Not for long.
