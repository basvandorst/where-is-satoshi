You’re right! I’ll add it straight away. Thanks!

Thanks a bunch! I've fixed them all now and I'm updating the site with a ton of new stuff later today. I'm really glad you took the time to write :)

Where were you 14 days ago ;)

Thanks! Great additions. I'll write some text for them tomorrow ��

I tried to call it that, but the domain was taken. Would have been a much better name!

Thanks! I’m changing the filter option now to start with one character instead of 3 - don’t know why I did that..
I think I’ll add a collapse function when the site gets bigger. Makes sense :)
Awesome feedback. Thanks again.

Awesome! I'm adding it right away. Thanks!

Thanks! Unfortunately a lot of the cool domains were already taken - so I had to make due. I'm glad you like the site :)

Yeah. Was trying to find a quick way to make it submission based to avoid spending a ton of time on it. If people like using the site I’ll definitely upgrade it ��

Thanks! Regarding open-source you can submit suggestions if you search for something that isnt there. I think Ill add it in the bottom as well. It’s not that easy to find. 
The name is difficult due to domains being taken. Unfortunately!
Good idea about the two column layout. It could work. I’ll try it out. 
Awesome you took the time to write!
