I'm not perma leaving (if i do), I'm only converting and then if I see Bitcoin start to rise close up to 9000 again I'll transfer back. but people who own an actual full Bitcoin must be shiting their pants right now.

but if you're going to do that I would wait until the dropping stops and see it kind of level off. because I'm not going to lie I did that when it dropped $1,000 but now it keeps dropping and I'm kind of worried. but as long as it doesn't go under $8,000 I want to stick it out.

I mean if Bitcoin is going to crash I'd rather lose a bit of money than all of my money. but looking back at Bitcoin right now it looks like it's leveled off around 8300-8400

I can kind of understand a lot of what you said but i lack when it comes to market trends and predicting the unpredictable while taking risks that can pay off. I just can't afford to take too many risks and like I've heard from multiple sources, only invest what you can afford to lose.

I don't have any more money to buy. and I'm only going to convert to another crypto cuz I use coinbase and I'll convert back once the price starts a upward trend

I'm just doing my own thing as long as Bitcoin stays above $8,000 I'll stick in the market and see if it goes back up.

but no seriously though if it drops under 8000 my loss will be too great and I can't afford that at the moment.
