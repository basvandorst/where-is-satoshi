The passphrase was weak enough to be brute-forced. If jron hadn't taken them, someone else could've. And that someone else probably wouldn't be posting on reddit offering to give the money back.
jron's course of action was correct.

Why would you risk your business by essentially stealing LendingClub's name while participating in the same business model? Did it never occur to you guys that if you ever grow to a sizable userbase you'll probably be getting a letter from their lawyers?
You've obviously spent a lot of time on the business and your product. Coming up with a more original name could've prevented a lot of potential trouble for you guys.

You should have a little more respect for FOSS contributors who donate a lot of time and effort to help build the technologies that you use. If you have issues with luke-jr there are better ways to address them.

First of all, your complaint has nothing to do with the Bitcoin protocol.
Second, this already exists. Look into BIP 0021. It's a URI scheme. When a user clicks a bitcoin link the event is handled by whatever default client the user has set to handle bitcoin payments. All of the payment info gets pre-filled and the user only has to click send.

I don't foresee this. If you subscribe to the bitcoin-development mailing list you'll see how much discussion surrounds new features/changes. It's not just individual devs just pushing random changes.

Cool idea, but your website doesn't mention anything about "BitCoin" (should be Bitcoin).
In what way have you decided to use "BitCoin" and how do you plan on getting through Apple's reviewers?
