So MtGox has about 55 Million$ (64%) in cash and total amount they owe creditors is about 85 Million$.
They also have 202000 BTC (26%) and total amount that they owe creditors is 750.000.
Therefore I assume (hope?) that everyone in cash will get at least 60% of their money back. Everyone with BTC will probably get a maximum of 25% back. 
Court will decide to sell all 202000 BTC for about 101 million dollars. Then the company will have about 155 Million dollar in cash. All creditors with cash can be paid for 100% and they will still have additional money that might be given to customers based on the number of BTC they had. 
As this is in Japan, they will have an Octopus decide the next steps

God, please let it be true. You can say a lot about Mark but I truly don't think he is the type of guy that would screw thousands of people and just leave it like that. He is not your typical scammer

It is impossible that they ship worldwide for free?? It would cost them money with every order.

Thanks for posting, I had the same issue and balance is now visible to me also.

The sell wall was from a Russian investor who wanted to get get out before Poetin officially bans bitcoin.

On the contrary. people with 5 to 50 BTC are considered "little people". The real big holders that have more than 100 BTC will have big losses. With one month working you can buy 3 to 5 BTC, so the people that had less than 5 BTC should be OK.

This is all true and the same happened to me while trying to withdraw euros and after I got my money out I stopped using Bitstamp for ever.
They have been doing it for months already, there are many threads on bitcointalk about it like this one:

You should not mix the value of the BTC with their fiat debts. It will not be looked at that way. 
Currently, as stated on MtGox site, they have total amount of assets 3,841,866,163 and total amount of current liabilities 6,501,119,371. So 33% payout with fiat should be possible I think.

thanks Erik, If I had 144.000+ coins and I had lost "just" 500 coins I would write the same and not even be mad. 
But I pretty much lost everything I had (50 BTC), so yes I am depressed to say the least. I feel very very bad and will probably die from too much alcohol this evening.

Why don't the Winklevoss brothers invest another 10 to 20 million dollars now in BTC as they seem to be so confident that BTC will be worth 10.000 and they still have at least 80 million on their bank accounts?

What happened to the "it is temporarily unavailable" that karpeles had said about the missing bitcoins? I still have hope that some more bitcoins will be "found"

You bought a rusty hammer with BTC?

Thanks and fuck you to. Small fish must die so the bigger fish survive. That is also how it works in the real world. 
Also small fish do not get to vote, the Japanese government that is looking at the case will have to make a decision about it. They can not please everyone.

Same for me, don't worry, once the court finishes "polishing" I am sure that info will be visible also. 
What date was your withdraw? Mine was on 17 January.

Previously deadline was today, 28 March.

Well, as according to Japanese law fiat is actually considered a currency and BTC not I think there is a chance that they can decide to do it that way. I would not want it either but the court could decide to do that.

The day one bitcoin is worth that much is the day that world poverty will end. I truly believe that most bitcoin holders have a good heart and are willing to share with the needy.

We get very limited info about the MtGox heist, and the info we get is always about the missing bitcoins. But WTF happened to all the EUR and USD on their bank accounts? Surely, that must be still on those bank accounts and could not have been stolen that easily.

It is a pilot for 6 months. You can exchange euros for ETH and BTC. If enough people use it it will stay there permanent. I will use it for sure, I hope all fellow Dutch people and also the tourists visiting the Netherlands will use it al least once in the next 6 months

In the very unlikely case that you lose both the trezor and the paper with the 20 words. You will have A backup plan
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:06:03
Buy Ethereum or Bitcoin, store everything on a Trezor or Ledger hardware wallet. Write down the 20 words seed and take this paper with you together with the hardware wallet. If one of the 2 gets lost you will still have access to your coins. 
Leave a second copy well hidden somewhere in the country you are departing from just in case.
