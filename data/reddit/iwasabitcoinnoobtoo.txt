The mempool is, at present, processing transaction fees of 14+sat/B every block. Assuming an average transaction size of 226 bytes, using Coinbase's current price of $11,000.01USD/BTC, that calculates to a fee of $0.35USD to get processed in 10-30 minutes.

Childish, sure, but *hateful?* I don't see it. Maybe it could have been presented in a more mature manner, but it's still criticism, not hatred.


Which is perhaps a somewhat flowery variation of the common phrase, "the truth comes out", but it's no more cultish than the slogan of the Washington Post, "Democracy dies in darkness". Is journalism a cult for exposing the truth to light?

At least you're fair on that. That's respectable.
I don't think I've ever seen the term "bcash" used explicitly as an attack on BCH. As far as I can tell, personally, the people who get upset by taking the "Bitcoin" out of "Bitcoin Cash" seem to be largely the same people who have no problem with taking the "Cash" out of "Bitcoin Cash". I've seen people make a distinction between "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Legacy". This leads me to see the issue as an attempt at a territorial dispute over the name "Bitcoin" itself.
Personal biases: I'm not opposed to BCH as a product. I don't hold any, because the technology doesn't fill me with confidence, but I'm not opposed to it. I am, however, opposed to the shady politicking behind the big BCH players, though, because it's completely unnecessary. If BCH is going to stand, it should stand on its own.

(Short answer: no. I don't think so.)
It's been a good number of years since I was dual-booting, but back then, the biggest snag was just making sure you installed Windows first. This was to make sure you used GRUB as your bootloader, as the Windows bootloader wouldn't detect the Linux system. (Gee, I wonder why.)
Nowadays, I don't know. The only thing I can see that might make it harder than that is Secure Boot, but I believe that issue has been worked out. I can't imagine setting up a dual-boot is much, if any, harder than it was back in the day.

It's tempting to try to find some silver bullet solution, but I don't think there is one. I'm not in any tribalist camp on this issue. I think the best solution is a combination of renewable technologies, used where they're best suited.
Nuclear is the closest we have to that silver bullet right now. It's the safest, cheapest, and cleanest. Unfortunately, the public perception is just the opposite, and that seems unlikely to change. Realistically, that's going to be a major obstacle for increased adoption.
Wind, I think, is best used regionally. I live between the sea and the mountains, for example. With the right turbine placement, it's *always* windy. 
Solar, I think, is the best realistic bet for covering most of the production. It's not as nice as nuclear, no, but it doesn't even come close to nuclear's PR problem, and it's better than everything else. 
Storage isn't so bad as you seem to think. The most exciting innovation here, in my opinion, is smart contract based storage distribution. Think mesh smart grids. I believe this could very well be the glue between small scale battery solutions, and infrastructural solutions like pumped hydro. If it is, I stand by what I said: we already have everything, save for political approval, needed to get the entire world on 100% solar. It might not be the best possible option, or even the most realistic, but the bottom line is that we can go completely green.

You're right that they were exactly the same until recently. And then one forked off to head in its own direction.

Last night, before the split, I transferred all of my BTC to a temporary wallet, where it is now. That way, there was no balance on my main wallet at the time of the split. Here's my plan from this point out:
* Now that BCC/BCH has a few blocks under its belt, I can safely transfer my BTC back to my main wallet, while the BCC/BCH will remain in the temporary wallet, which is now otherwise empty.
* I can then take the private key of that temporary address, and sweep it into a BCC/BCH wallet on Coinomi. (Alternately, I could use the Electrum seed to the temporary wallet, and restore the entire wallet in Electron Cash. Maybe this might be a better option?)
* Voila, I now should safely have both BTC and BCC/BCH. Right?
Is it really that easy? Is there anything I'm overlooking? Despite the past tense of my username, I'm still new to all of this. I'd like to avoid any surprise gotcha's. If I somehow screw up and permanently lose all of my BCC/BCH, well, it's not like I'd have any less than I did yesterday. If I screw up and lose my BTC, that's another story.

What about 1 BTC being worth 800 Big Macs? 
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:43:34
I guess what I don't get is why we have to get away from the mindset that 1BTC = 4,000USD, any more than we have to get away from the mindset that 1JPY = 0.009USD. Currencies, such as Bitcoin or Yen, will always have exchange rates between each other. That's an important property for them to have.
Maybe I'm missing something, but what it sounds like you're asking for more liquidity. I could sit here and say that 1BTC is 800 Big Macs, but that doesn't mean anything if McDonald's doesn't accept payment in BTC. If McDonald's only accepts payment in USD, then 1BTC = 4,000USD = 800 Big Macs. That's the same, mathematically, but the actual execution is different because of the liquidity of the fiat.
You're right, there is a long way to go before we reach that point. With the breakneck pace of BTC action, it can be easy to forget that the currency really hasn't been out that long at all. We're still early adopters, even those of us who didn't get in until just this year. Still, I think I can see that sort of liquidity and adoption on the (distant) horizon.
@_date: 2017-08-21 14:46:22

The answer to this depends a bit on whether the 3.5 floppy is the anachronism, or the BBS. If the floppy is out of place in this scenario, then no, sending a photo was definitely not faster than driving to your friend's house to look at it in a book. 
If the BBS is out of place, then you might be able to download the photo faster... if the photo is heavily compressed and the friend lives on a different block. It still would be faster to borrow your friend's nudie magazine than trying to download anywhere close to that many photos, though, let alone the same image quality. Until the early 00's, it really was faster to use a phone book than AltaVista.
The Internet really was slow, even compared to existing technologies that filled similar niches. Speed wasn't much of a selling point, so much as globalization and the vast quantity of information. Especially so with the World Wide Web.

The size of a Bitcoin transaction is determined by the number of inputs and outputs in that transaction.
Let's say you had three bars of gold, valued at $300, $400, and $500, respectively. If you wanted to use these to make a transaction of $500, it would be simple to just hand over the single $500 bar of gold. In this transaction, there's one input (the single bar you give), and one output (the single bar of gold the other person gets).
Using those three bars of gold, making a transaction of $700 is only a teensy bit trickier. For this transaction, you can give the $300 bar and the $400 bar (two inputs), while the other person can keep both bars as-is. (Two outputs.)
Now, using those three bars to make a transaction for $600 is clearly even trickier than the above two examples. You can't simply take any two of the three bars and have them neatly add up to a $600 transaction. Instead, what you have to do is take two bars-- say, the $500 and $300 bars-- to a goldsmith who can melt down the two existing bars. (Again, two inputs.) Once your $800 of gold is melted together, it can be reformed into two new bars: a $600 "payment" bar, and a $200 "change" bar. (Two outputs.) Now you have two bars of gold: the $400 bar you kept, and the $200 "change" bar you just got back.
Now, let's go back to that second example. Remember how the size of a Bitcoin transaction is determined by the number of inputs and outputs? This example had two outputs, but there really isn't any need for both outputs, since only one person is walking away with gold. So you can use the goldsmith from the third example to melt down your two (input) bars, to combine them into one (output) bar. This keeps the transaction "size" down by eliminating the extra output.
Going back to the $200 and $400 bars left over from the third example, now let's say that the goldsmith has a fee per bar in and out. This fee changes every day, and can fluctuate pretty wildly. Without the fee, in order to make a $300 transaction, You need to melt the $400 bar into a $300 bar and a $100 bar. Unfortunately, today's fee is high, at $50 per bar, making the fee for this transaction $150, eating up all of your $100 change, and forcing you to add in the $200 bar (+$50 fee) to make up the difference. With the fee, you've now spent $500 for a $300 transaction. Ouch.
But instead, let's say that today's fee is low, at $1/bar, and you have a few days before you need to make that transaction. The smart thing to do would be consolidation. You can combine the two bars into one, for a fee of (2 inputs + 1 output x $1/bar) $3, thus eliminating the need for a second, potentially expensive input for the $300 transaction. Assuming that the fee at the day of the transaction is still $50/bar, this saves you a total of ($50 saved - $3 spent) $47.
The analogy breaks down if you stretch it much further, but I hope this gives you a better understanding of transaction sizes and fees.

Yeah, Poloniex isn't available in my area, either. With recent legislation changes, though, it could be available some time in the future.

It's a reference to the Jonestown massacre, in which hundreds of people committed mass suicide by drinking cyanide-laced Flavor Aid, at the command of cult leader Jim Jones. 
Edit: the phrase "drinking the Kool-Aid" means behaving irrationally, as though you've been brainwashed.

Thank you for this. My problem with the argument that all fiat eventually goes to zero is that it's a prime example of ~~survivor bias.~~ (Edit: *reverse* survivor bias.) Sure, every fiat goes to zero if the only data points you look at are the fiats that have already gone to zero.
Of course, when you throw in the word "eventually" and remove all sense of a time frame, it does become technically true. *Eventually* the human race will go extinct, and what will USD be worth *then?*

That's more specifically prepared foods. It doesn't cover groceries, just dining out. Just as a point of clarification.

That thing about the chips is weird, yeah. I know it's definitely not the venue that makes the difference, though. If you go to a grocery store, most things won't be taxed, but the hot foods by the deli, like the fried chicken and the mozzarella sticks will. Lobster isn't taxed if you buy it to bring it home and cook it yourself, but if you have the store cook it for you, it is.

This is true. That said, you gotta admit, between AOL and Doom in '93, Win95 and Doom 2 in '95, Quake in '96, those were pretty heady days leading up to the boom.

None. He decided he was getting too emotionally connected to the performance of his investments, and the money wasn't worth the stress.

Oh, I must have missed the typo. I was just commenting on the last bit, about how NextSTEP was based on BSD, not Linux. A lot of people only know Unix through Linux, so they think of them as one and the same. Which, of course, isn't the case.

I think he did intend it that way, for a potential audience that might have a hard time understanding the mathematical intricacies that more solid logic would require. Sometimes it's easier to get the message across by simply saying, "trust me, I know what I'm talking about."

I didn't say we were at mass adoption yet. The analogy was to compare the technology itself, not how popular it is.

My bad. I didn't realize you'd take my disingenuous pedantry seriously. It's not that I missed the point. It's just that I thought it would be funny to break the point with something technically true yet still absurd.
But now that I've had to explain the joke, it's not funny anymore. :/

I wasn't trying to compare it the stocks boom. It was definitely a technology analogy, but it was comparing today's Bitcoin to the Internet at the time of mass adoption in the mid-90's, not to the Internet of the 1970's.
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:05:43
You're reading way too much into my mention of the dot-com boom. I wasn't talking about the boom itself, I was talking about the period shortly before it, in the mid-90s. 
Regardless of what the OP was suggesting, the person you actually replied to was implying that the Internet users of 1995 had no need to know anything about TCP/IP. Which just isn't true. That has nothing to do with adoption. It's entirely about the state of the technology at a given point in its development.

In that case, since today is day 30/90, I can still take just a couple more days to squeeze out a few Satoshi, then withdraw, and wait a couple months to see what happens. If they stop serving US completely, I'm safe, and if they only go after verified accounts, I can just put my BTC back in.
