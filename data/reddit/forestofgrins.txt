[This fall]( students across the world are organizing a global initiative to educate their peers and join this rabbit hole of a technology.

The thing is, the technology is at a usable state **right now**. 
* You can use hedging services to maintain price stability
* you can use debit cards to spend at credit card terminals
* you get perks using bitcoin for amazon &amp; starbucks purchases
* A variety of regulated and p2p exchanges provides fiat liquidity
Bitcoin is at a point now where you can use a variety of different niche services to achieve the effect you want. Like an app store on your phone to solve your specific needs, it's exciting to use a variety of services without any friction.
**So what's holding it back?** 
I'd argue education and network effects (*if you don't know anyone to use it with, why use it?)*
When you bring up bitcoin with new people to gauge reactions, almost everyone has *heard* of it but no one really knows what it is. And for those who are curious and ask deeper what it is, they are actually quite intrigued after learning a bit deeper.
The next step is using it with people around you. It's useless unless you can split the tab at a bar with a friend who also uses it. Until you get to that point, this technology never leaves your mental perspective of "fun money". 
Thus, I'd argue we don't need technological innovation, we need a strong push on grassroots education and meetups that make impact in their local communities. A small group of enthusiasts create a stable base for more to come, and a larger group of enthusiasts can have impact on their town/city. And when you can use the technology with a large network of people in your vicinity, you're more likely to dive through the myriad of startups providing this modular financial app store.
When we have enthusiasts across the world changing their community, that is, in aggregate: the visual progress bar of this paradigm shift.

What are you currently doing in bitcoin? There is a growing bitcoin community at NYU and Fordham, perhaps I can help connect you with the students there. 
But you shouldn't limit yourself to just bitcoin scholarships. There are so many scholarships for odd things and you can collect a few to reduce your price. 
@_date: 2016-04-01 22:10:19
Well it's awesome you are diving in so quickly and already trying to involve your self as much as possible. 
If you're interested in programming then perhaps you should you  look into hackathons. There are a lot opportunities for [students in blockchain](HTTP://blockchainedu.org).
This industry is still new. It offers a ton of opportunity but mostly self made and through personally making impacts. Try to team up with people doing great things, involve yourself and learn, participate in great opportunities, and that will reward future opportunities. 
Yet unfortunately blockchain isn't very institutional yet and you probably won't see much support from regular scholarship grants (that I know of). Are you interested in going directly into college or are you open to a year internship opportunity?

What's awesome about this project is that it was created by two students at RIT *(props to who is one of the devs)*, all in a months time. With such little time and resources, they were still able to build a working &amp; scalable beta product that competes with the security of professional implementations. 
And in the same [hackathon](  students from MIT created a better anonymous coin which advances the field of security and fungability.
As more dev-kits become available and companies get involved with student exploration of blockchain technologies, I wonder what more things can come up.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:25:31


That's blatantly incorrect, in that [same blog post]( they mention the implementation of limits and fraud prevention mechanisms.


I can post a wall of links for PayPal fraud, eBay/Craigslist scams, etc and those don't represent the mass user experience.
Playing this game I'll add in my own anecdotes: friends and I use Purse whenever we shop on Amazon and we've never had so much as a hitch.


M-Pesa is a payment platform, like paypal, not a bank. They cannot take out loans, do international exchange, pay outside their payment network, etc. 
And the bitcoin integration is [right here]( Thus enabling users of MPesa to work remotely (coding, web dev, graphic design, etc) and get paid to their local MPesa account... all using bitcoin as the settlement layer between the two currencies and payment industry environments (traditional banks vs telecom provided credit). 
And Bitpesa isn't the only one, the point is that anyone can code up these gateways.


Yes? Please show me the MPesa to Giftcard market that has a larger volume than the bitcoin-giftcard market? 
Plus you don't need to be an expert to use bitcoin, you can use one of the many user-friendly wallets online and then it's just like any other payment platform.


I have no idea what you are arguing here. I said there is an open market of unused gift cards. 
Let's run some back of the envelop calculations. On a high-volume promotional sales day, Purse moved [$24,000]( of sales during Amazon Prime day.
Let's say that every single day they have the same sales figure as this promotional day: and that's about $8.5m per year That's **.85%** of the unused gift card market.
I don't understand what argument you are trying to make here. I said there was plenty of opportunity, of which purse is only scratching a minuscule piece of. I described the context of this small piece of the credit is coming from: from reward programs like MTurk &amp; from unused cards received as gifts. What are you trying to say?
And how am I moving goalposts?


If I just said you represent all the arguments I've seen, and then I've consistently had responses with sources to each one of your questions, then how would "the search bar" do anything different?


Are you comparing an anonymous black drug market, in which all it's actors and operations are completely unknown, is the same as an incorporated company with it's CEO and team publically listed?
I know you are trying to pigeon hole your argument to fit, but are you kidding me? How could you possibly "win" with an analogy like that to pretend Purse is some anonymous shell corporation in some Caribbean island (or some other similar shady setup in which it's comparable to the silk road)?
And in this analogy... the silk road STILL got caught a year and a half after making the public spotlight. Purse has been around for about a year and few months now...

Yes? Have you like ever traveled and checked local Bitcoin? You can exchange Bitcoin pretty much everywhere: you can't do that with Starbucks credit.
Fold and Purse have been around for over a year now. Are you saying they are blatantly money laundering and just haven't been picked up by the IRS? 
Especially fold which isn't even a marketplace as the company curates the selection of gift cards. They have even described their acquisition process and noted they are aware of cheaper carded gift cards and stay away from them because otherwise they would get shut down.

Yes... it does. 
I love bitcoin but I find these posts unbelievable. There is no reason someone should try to escape an unsure situation buy purchasing a volatile asset. ESPECIALLY during this blocksize debate which adds more uncertainty to bitcoin's future. 
For some savvy person, perhaps they could make it work. But even then it's scary to suggest to someone who's not familiar with it.

And no, these treads in general about greece and bitcoin are not geared towards the technically savvy bitcoin folks in greece... they are already in bitcoin. These threads are saying that bitcoin is a solution to the capital controls in which I have a great problem with. 
I also want to debate the "know-how" clause because with something like bitcoin it's not simply being aware of how computers work. I've been using bitcoin for a while and still learn new ways to make it usable in my life. How could someone just hearing about it get to that level of understanding? And then use it without error or mistake?

Without bitcoin. They have really good money transfer systems which blows the west out of the water. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 22:36:31


That is money laundering. That's where you mentioned it. 


I'm sure are a few carders on Purse. But just like in your example, they get caught. This is no different than carding on ebay or any other e-commerce site. There are systems in place to monitor and catch this. Have you even used Purse? You don't release the bitcoin until the order is shipped to your door, and thus Amazon would have canceled the order if it was from a stolen CC. 
So why does one sensationalized anecdote represent the majority of customers/sellers? Using your logic, every Muslim is a terrorist and every pro-lifer is going to blow up abortion clinics. 


Are you listening to yourself? Are you seriously trying to tell me that global banking access, with complete freedom/access to funds, despite economic level, exists across the world **in more frequency** than internet/computer access? 
Dude. Africa. 
Because banking infrastructure is so weak and inaccessible there, telecom providers in many countries have stepped up to create digital money systems. Look at [MPesa]( which has created the infrastructure where individuals can use SMS on their phones to send and recieve money, and use these booths to withdraw/deposit cash.
In these communities and many other, having access to an old 5-6 year old computer isn't tremendously noteworthy, and there are often hotspots where they can get internet during certain times of the day. 
If you don't have a job and have these tools, earning $1-3 hr might actually translate to a savvy way to generate income. And since the cost of living is lower, the $1-3 is quite decent, and thus it's still competitive despite losing 20-40% through the gift card &amp; bitcoin premiums.


No matter how small you think the bitcoin industry is, it's much bigger than the "starbucks gift card to rupee (in cash)" industry will ever be. **Thus yes.**
Plus it's not even just these MTurkers, but also the massive amount of people who get gift cards that they don't want and would rather have cash. In the US there was over **[$1 billion]( of unused gift card credit.
Bitcoin is barely scratching this. 
So why is this carding argument brought up so many times? It's so ridiculous to expect that because of a headlined news article of an illicit activity, that it accounts for the entire userbase. Much less, would Purse be able to raise over a million dollars in investments or last for over a year if all it's activity was CC fraud? Do you think the IRS would just let that fly?

STOOOOP WITH THIS. 
Guys seriously, people going broke because of bank runs is not funny business. Bitcoin is no where near ready to be an escape currency for people in dire economic positions. 
Let's say someone does decide to store their savings in bitcoin to escape a bank run. Does that save them from bitcoin's volatility? Does that mean they can easily liquidate? Are there nearly enough local sellers who can get them cash needed to buy things they need?
In these situations having your money in a safer bank account would be a much better position. 
**Let's stop with this**
People will use bitcoin if it's useful and solves their problems. We should focus on offering solutions that don't introduce more problems. This can still be done with bitcoin but we shouldn't just recklessly tell people to just "get bitcoin" without offering a full spectrum of apps that can be used to live their life. 
Sure if you are super savvy then you might be able to make something work, but definitely not for the average joe to pick up.

Bitcoin usually has pretty large grey markets all over the world. You pay a premium but local Bitcoin and similar services are available everywhere. Much easier to convert Bitcoin than amazon credit this way, even if it still isn't super straight forward.
And the arrests were with sites that were selling gift cards for like 80% off or more. Those were def carded. That's dramatically different than folds 20%
@_date: 2015-06-26 10:57:10
This doesn't make sense. A private blockchain is just a database. A blockchain infers a database that is maintained by a decentralized network to maintain security, uncensored transactions, and openly accessible. 
Not saying this makes a blockchain more useful than a database in every situation, but its stupid to call a database a blockchain just because it's a buzzword.

Honestly I really hate the stupid HODL shit. How can an alternative economy grow if people don't actually spend the currency?
All these startups, businesses accepting bitcoin, and new applications need users to actually *use these services* in order for them to be successful. If everyone chooses to just lock them away and browse reddit, then the people making these applications won't get users and upcoming developers have no incentive to enter the game and offer cool new services. 
I really hope this stupid HODL meme dies. What's wrong with using the currency and then just replenishing? It's the same thing so why shouldn't that be the mantra?
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:50:09
No I don't think we should stop telling people to be cautious. Too many people here are not actually in the situation these people are in and have no idea what they are suggesting. 


Not necessarily. What if they lose their wallet key, what if they can't find local sellers because there isn't a large enough crypto community, what if the value of bitcoin plummets during the blocksize debates or mishandling. 
Getting a german bank account would be a much safer and familiar option, not bitcoin.

By know how that means you'd have to fully understand bitcoin, cold storage, know the variety of bitcoin services to pay bills/make purchases, and use pegged cryptos in order to save important amounts without volatility. 
The people who know how to do all this is slim, and I'm bugged that people are suggesting bitcoin as an answer to economic crisis when it's unlikely a newcomer would pick this all up with ease (and without difficulties). 


Because being critical of an idea on doesn't make someone anti-bitcoin. Your post is the exact reason why is so hard to have a discussion because the second there is dissent, you're marked as a troll. 
I am a very active bitcoiner and use it regularly with my everyday life. So it's frustrating that when I voice a comment against an unthought out idea, it's accounted for as being "against bitcoin". Grow up.

Mturk. There's a huge amount of individuals in developing countries (India, Pakistan, etc) who do small tasks and earn a small monthly income. 
Since they can't cash out with PayPal, they usually cash out with amazon/Starbucks credit and then try converting that to cash. 
Here's where that market gap is being solved. You want amazon/starbucks and they have gift credit, and they want cash. This a market is created to determine the need for speed/price. 
Now they want cash, not Bitcoin. But it's easier to convert Bitcoin to local cash for some than amazon credits.

I think the negativity is just that people don't want there to be unnecessary confusion with kids trying this out.
For example, on your website you had a figure of how many bits were given out: I didn't know if this was satoshis or bits which makes a big difference. 
Now in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter too much. It's good your doing this regardless. Yet I can see why the usage of bits for satoshis would be an annoyance to some and an easy fix in verbage.

But get this, even if the banks use some alternative blockchain, they will inherently be using digital tokens (or else why use blockchains at all). 
Even if they create their own system, if tokenized that still makes it easy for bitcoin-integrations. Atleast it will be easier than the current withdrawal models of bank wiring.

@_date: 2014-01-26 11:53:20
Your absolutely correct in saying that everyone is free to make their own altcoin off of the bitcoin source code. Yet this is exactly what gives the bitcoin protocol value because these alt coins are simply copy and pasting the original work of bitcoin. They are not adding any value on their own because they are competing to become a currency rather then using the invention of a decentralized ledger for some other technology.
This is very much present by looking at the price timelines of altcoins with Bitcoin, and its easy to see their vitally connected towards the success of bitcoin. Not once has there been a bitcoin correction without it also affecting these alt coins. This is because altcoins are currently only useful for getting bitcoin out of them, not fiat or goods, just for playing the rise and falls of daily bitcoin trends.
Why is this? Well no one takes a copy cat without innovation seriously. Bitcoin is valuable because its limited and unable to be counterfeited; if it wasn't scarce then it wouldn't be valuable. Something that copies bitcoin and simply resets the scarcity is not going to have long tern success because it is obviously a clone (I mean that works with modern day art, why aren't exact counterfeits worth the same as the original?). These innate features which keep bitcoin valuable are what prevents direct copycats from receiving value from direct copies.
Dodgecoin and others can be easily pumped and dumped by large holders due to the incredibly small value they have, and thus individuals with trading knowledge take advantage of this for short term gain. The markets are shallow enough to allow individuals to have enormous influence on the entire market. Also I would add that dodgecoin has helped bitcoin grow as it showed non interested memers the value of a decentralized digital currency. Even if they don't have btc now, they are much more aware of how it works and its function Noe that they have "played" with dodgecoin. The same way that monopoly teaches resource management in comparison to capitalism at large.
Twister and bitcloud are rising examples of the opposite of this. They are attempting to use the block chain invention for other purposes other then finance, and thus they will receive recognition by adding useful protocols to the world such as a decentralized twitter and Dropbox. They are not trying to become a currency at all, but are using the ideas of btc to create some amazing inventions to empower people without interference.
Yet, really no one can tell the future. And I like to inform people I explain concepts to that this is only my deduction from following bitcoin from late 2013. This is truly a great global experiment of both finance and human behavior. We really don't have much precedent for this the same way we had no precedent for how the internet would affect communication (and by that it has completely changed it entirely). 
I hope I didn't come off as too evangelic, yet I personally have had awesome experiences with bitcoin through my graphic design work. I was able to test and train my skills with individuals around the world and build a resume and get paid for doing so. It has shown me the amazing potential of expanding finance applications without borders and I hope more have similar experiences as myself. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:23:57
Thanks for explaining this, I appreciate you breaking it down. 
I feel embarrassed that I'm still missing the main point. I would expect that when other miners with more hashrate join a P2Pool, the more likely P2Pool will find blocks. This would increase the amount of blocks found and thus smaller miners that contribute would still be rewarded equally as before (more often but less amounts). 
Thanks again for trying to explain this though, that definitely describes the workings of p2pools very well. 50 bits ^@_date: 2014-11-17 14:13:33
**Who here has used Brawker?**
I've heard of this service in the past but always stayed away because I've heard of bad experiences on the competitor site Purse.io. How do either of these sites handle the same problem that prevents buying bitcoin with credit-cards -&gt; chargeback?
If you buy something off Amazon, or pay a parking ticket, etc... what stops the person who bought the coin from initiating a chargeback later? There is the additional middle-man of the merchant, but is this a big problem on these platforms and how do they mitigate that?
If it's really as great as it considers itself, I can see myself using Brawker in the future to get nice discounts on my stuff and stop using fiat hehe.

There are gateways like [Coinvoice]( available that let you create your own BTC &lt;-&gt; USD pathways.
Yet I'd continue doing the thing your doing while also telling the story of why your slowly moving towards bitcoin and away from paypal. 
Tell them of the troubles you've had in the past, how you'd like to engage in international transfers cheaper, how you'd like to have more control of your funds; and thus will offer a 5% (or more) discount on all future business payments done in bitcoin over paypal. 
I think this is a nice incentive for people to hear what your saying, feel the emotion behind it, and then have a reward for if they decide to look up the technology and see how it could fit in their life *(because hey, a 5% discount is nice).*
Plus as you said, this doesn't require immediate change and lets people who might be interested switch over on their own comfortable time (and thus will be more likely to).

Once people are using decentralized messengers, decentralized exchanges (coinffeine), decentralized markets (OpenBazaar), decentralized cloud storage (maidsafe/storj), they will be more then happy and comfortable with their decentralized money.

You are being ridiculous; if you convert Bitcoin to USD then you have to follow the normal conventions that apply to USD.
For many bitcoiners; it's common to have a "savings account" of bitcoin and simply cash out as you need items/pay the bills. Of which this process is incredibly liquid.
*To give you some real life examples*; I do [graphic design work]( for individuals all over the world. You have no idea how incredibly liberating it is to work with any client despite their geographic location. For some clients I don't even know their names or where they are; yet I complete the jobs they request and I get the money (which I can immediately cash into USD deposited straight into my bank account with coinbase) within minutes of request. 


No **you** are missing the point. I can very easily send bitcoin to any individual around the world with no issue. I can send a valuable and exchangeable "commodity" without crossing any hurdles. That is a monumental milestone. Liquidity, exchanges, and place of sale is where entrepeneaurs go out to take advantage of these situations to become the next *Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc* of Bitcoin
Assuming they use bitcoin like I do; they can hold their wealth in bitcoin and then convert/spend as they would normally with zero issues of liquidity. 
Pulling 1M USD means your dealing with 1M USD. If I sold you 1M USD worth of gold (or any other commodity): you'd have the same problems trying to bulk convert.  
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:26:23
Why can't we just join in with no fees at all? The technology exists and anyone can freely program it into any solution already being used.
What's the controversy? Banks could easily defeat this statement by simply using bitcoin internally to decrease fees and show their meta-superiority. Drawing a conflict over a technology that has limitless uses is to look at it through narrow lens.

More immediately, bitcoin is more secure. When you make transactions online you have to give up sensitive credit card information which is stored for who knows how long.
This was abused recently with the target scandal where their credit card database of customer information was breached. Again it was an issue for PayPal when an employee was tricked into giving out credit card information.
Bitcoin prevents all of this and dices the user peace of mind

When the company charges $10 to the customer, and they pay in bitcoin, the merchant receives $10 in their bank accounts the same day.
Every other processor takes significantly more time because of potential chargebacks. 
It costs 1% to buy bitcoin from coinbase and circle is doing this for free.
@_date: 2014-11-29 14:51:46
Also they state on the site that the 3% discount is for the saved transaction fees &amp; chargeback risk. It's just simply passing on the savings from switching to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:40:48
Bitcoin is very beneficial to merchants: why?
1.  No charge backs
2. Zero transaction fees (paid by sender)
3. Zero setup costs (just download a free program).
If you wish to have a service convert bitcoins to USD instantly upon each sale, BitPay and coinbase have excellent tools and trusted reputation.
The benefit of these services is that you can accept bitcoin to have USD deposited directly into your bank account that very day (and with a flat 30$/month fee you get free Bitcoin &gt; USD &gt; bank account transactions. (As in Zero transaction fees for a flat $30 month rate). 
Once you see and want the benefits, you can show your support by accepting bitcoin.
Yet note: because you are saving money using bitcoin, pass on a little of those savings to your bitcoin customers to encourage more transactions in bitcoin. This is the type of relationship that incentivizes bitcoiners to spend and encourages more people to check out bitcoin.
This is what the community is looking for, when you reach these steps you immediately gain our support (and hopefully that translate to traffic).

Being the first smartphone isn't pathetic, but not being able to lead the industry with the newest features despite the headstart is. 
Apple gets 1-2 year head start on android, yet android quickly closes the gap between features and then starts implementing features unavailable on the iPhone (of which iOS then packages into an aesthetic wrapper and releases it at their next conference). 
Shouldn't iOS have more features then android since it had a head start and significant market share? I was pointing out to that.

No, hindsight is easy, timing market movements isn't. 
For most, there is a belief in this technology in which they have no need to time these movements. For every success story there are also stories of someone selling right as it went up, or buying as it went down. 
For them, 1100 is not the long-term value they hold in the technology and their place within that ledger.

I'm not a huge fan of non-voluntary donations. I think changetip is a really awesome service already, and if a user wanted, it would be cool if they could voluntarily switch on that feature. 
Yet it would be much more powerful to create an easy to use website that allows you to tip any amount by simply scanning a barcode. Then the transaction would be pooled up until it reaches a threshold to reward all active miners in the network. This would make it easy for bitcoiners to use grassroot marketing to make the effort possible.

You should definitely be careful with your personal information and I'm not advising hasty decisions on that: but if you could reach out and send them an email I'm sure this topic will be considered even more seriously!

See the thing is if people used this self interest and all decided to join p2p pools then there would be no issue (and everyone would receive more money without cex as the middle man).
I disagree that choosing cloud miners is "rational self interest" as the whole concept is rather absurd. Its sort of like trusting MTGOX with the amount of money people invest in these services. If they instead used their profits to build p2p networks we would have much more robust mining pools immune to take over and there would be more profits for miners witless middlemen.
I view cloud mining as rather silly: if you want bitcoin then simply buy it or market your skills for it. If you want to mine then be ready to take on a large hobby that requires maintenance. If your not willing to do it yourself then you should not be mining in the first place as its a really inefficient way of buying bitcoin through funding cex, with the added loss of not having the machines yourself despite investing money into them.

Nope, you can use multi sig wallets similar to green address or blockchaon.info.
With this the server can prompt spends but the user would approve from their local client or private wallet. The server never holds a single bitcoin.
Plus you can add time lock to transactions so that there is a delay after each spend. This gives admins with user permision time to cancel transactions if something is off.

The bitcoin economy needs users to mess around and use services, spend coins, in order to let things get on it's feet. 
Currently bitcoin is super super small and filled with mostly niche-users who are passionate about this technology. It requires these niche users to experiment with trying to use bitcoin as much as they can, sometimes at a financial loss, in order to create the incentive for more developers and services to enter the scene. 
When BBS's were on the scene, they cost operators tons and tons of money because the connection was ran through their phone line. Yet if these operators didn't exist, it wouldn't have allowed people to play around and encourage the greater development of the BBS ecosystem, the AOL moment, and then eventually into what we have now.

I've been doing graphic design for bitcoin since summer 2013, its rather awesome.
I'm more of a hobbyist freelancer but I perform work and show rough drafts for free and then release final copy to be used after payment to an address. 
Makes it easy for the customer to not pay upfront for shoddy work and I don't get screwed because if they like where I'm going with a draft it would be easier to just pay me for the final touched up draft with transparency then try and finish it on their own (without the source files).
Then again I'm a college student NOT in the UK, but it should be all the same.

The insurance and security on your wealth are cheaper using bitcoin with proper security measures (not perfect today but getting better over time)
Consumer protections and the rewards from using credit cards definitely do not net you a positive, or else the banks couldn't make a profit. They assume that the transaction fee will cover your benefits and consumer protection services and still net a profit. 
That couldn't happen if you were gaining more in rewards then if there were no transaction fees in the system to begin with. Laws are in place so that merchants can't raise he price for credit users so they bump up all their prices with credit in consideration for every transaction.

I'm surprised by the amount of hate here against merchants selling bitcoin. I think the idea to create local bitcoin merchants into bitcoin dispensers would be fantastic, ideally in the long term hold on to bitcoin from purchases to sell again at a higher rate.

I was just talking with a friend recently how it would be cool to have a go board, so this was perfect timing.
I had a problem with the online checkout unfortunately. If the coinbase module gives you too much trouble, I suggest bitpay. They are very professional and have very little complaints against them.
But I'm happy to wait out until it's resolved regardless of vendor (unless you wanted to shoot me a PM and I'd do the order manually :P). 
Btw, I wanted this [versatile board]( and also some cheap stones although unfortunately it seems like I have to buy sample packs or the 28$ Bento Box (which does come with the 19x19 which is nice, but still pushing the wallet seems).

Have you seen solutions like Bitreserve or coinapult? They completely remove volatility while retaining the spending abilities of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin allows a modular approach to solve problems. This will allow for a flexible ecosystem in the future that is easily accessible across the world. There will be "an app for that" in every situation that Bitcoin currently has difficulties. Some solutions will be centralized and some decentralized, yet they will be able to be pieced together that works best for the individual/project.
Again, right now someone with a good bank account has more ability than the blockchain. Yet the competition is coming from the bottom-up not top-down

I don't really understand the ripple hate; I don't own ripples but recognize it as a valuable somewhat decentralized currency exchange the compliments the bitcoin network. 
If ripple were to be used more widely, individuals would have a much easier time entering and leaving the bitcoin market without using convoluted methods to prevent chargeback. 
Then again I would never hold ripples myself as a store of value; I never even used it as a network; but I think it would be valuable if it became more supported with more gateways.

Your next miner's fee is on me, 100 bits ^@_date: 2014-05-20 15:32:40
Congratulations! Here's another 500 bits towards your son's future!
Here are some initial tips for how to think about Bitcoin
* Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system. Think PayPal except without a company in the middle taking fees. 
* Bitcoin is also store of value. There will be a limited amount of coins that will ever be assigned to the public ledger. By 2140ish we should be nearing the 21 million bitcoin cap. (Thus it's sort of like gold or rare metals except digital).
* Bitcoin is a global socio-economic experiment. It gives access to anyone with an internet connection, and through it's useful ability to send units of value without middlemen or extensive infrastructure has caused it's value to grow tremendously.
* Merchants love bitcoin because of services like [BitPay]( Just look at those pricing plans, ZERO transaction fees and free setup. Oh and they get USD in their bank accounts, not bitcoin.
* Developers love bitcoin because anyone can make a service or tool on top of the bitcoin network. Sort of like how Google isn't the internet company, they are a company that runs services on the internet. Similar for bitcoin developers. This was not possible using banks as they require permission to innovate.
Whew, I'll leave you be for now. But as some context to why I love bitcoin; I'm a college student that used bitcoin with a graphic design interest to immerse myself into the community. It's been one amazing ride :)
Check out [CoinDesk]( they have an excellent description to help people understand what bitcoin is. 
Good luck!

Yikes, guys seriously calm down with the doge hate. 
It's getting really out of hand. Look at focal vision between the litany of downvotes over any mention of doge and then with the surprise and scoff reaction over the ban on **Bitcoin is a god damn tank.** If MtGOX, Silk Road, China, etc can't crash it then why are you so upset over any mention over the equivalent of a meme?
*We all say that bitcoin is internet of money... *well what do you think that means? People will use bitcoin and it's derivitives to whatever purpose they want, just like the internet. Dogecoin doesn't even compete with BTC because it's inflationary (like USD) vs delfationary. 
*The awesome part is we get to observe the differences in response to them. Perhaps later on some pretty smart people will be able to find some more economic truths from the data between them as well.*

@_date: 2014-11-18 21:34:42
Thanks for the clarification! 100 bits ^Well we won't find out until 2140 if bitcoin's inflation tax is all that keeps it alive. In my own opinion, I'm confident that this will be solved by then. I mean we are already seeing moves to increase the amount of transactions per block without penalizing the miner for doing so (with lag).
This dynamic development platform in addition to Mores law makes me think this problem will not be a big problem in the future. ((Although then again maybe it will!))

Your probably right, we need a real community effort to get people to donate to p2pools in order to subsidize the initial low hashrate. We need to educate the long term benefits of mining for P2Pools and against ghash.
I'm surprised these calls for p2p and easy tools have not been used more :( people are assholes for not tinkering with their machines away from ghash
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:28:24
Lookup PetaMine, they are looking to join P2Pools and also offer a dividend model that offers similar service to Ghash.

I wouldn't be so quick to believe. First off I'm sure this is terribly out of context or false all together. There is nothing more then this journalists' words, and judging by the dialogue with the police, I'm leaning on the side of it being dramatized. 
I'm leaning on the side of this being false until there is more evidence then her heresay. 
Satoshi was way too private; sending cash in mail to register bitcoin.org, encrypting all messages, leaving scene after initial startup - to just say he's the inventor of bitcoin to a crazy journalist who meets him on his lawn.
Plus analysis of the white paper versus his writings make it seem like a ridiculous comparison.

I'm trying to gain bitcoin awareness on my college campus. I have done a class speech and have been talking individually with a few students to discuss how it works and context of what it means for younger creative peoples. 
In that process I've made an [online tutorial]( that explains how to use a bitcoin paper wallet. 
Thus now I keep a few paper wallets on hand, and I'll slip 1 mBTC onto them before folding them, writing "take me" on it and hiding it in a corner (yet still noticeable). 
Currently I'm doing all of this via mycelium, adding them as watch wallets to see if they get taken. Yet I don't add the private key because I don't want to spend from these wallets by accident. Yet at the same time I believe that many will go unclaimed and I'll want to use these amounts again later (like several months from now). 
**What I want the app to do**
Let me make folders where I can add and monitor bitcoin wallets. Easily tell recent transactions from the folder.
Let me add description and geo-tag where I place wallets 
Let me scan a bitcoin address and get information about it's history, etc. 
When I make these PDFs, I encrypt them after use so I can access the unused ones later.

My favorite service by far is changetip, I've put over $30 into this puppy and I find it incredibly fun to use. Especially since you can't do the same with USD. I also enjoy using cardforcoin to get discounts off starbucks.
Yet I still love making my purchases in BTC and then topping off. I hate using my card because security risks for fraud. For example, there were times where I needed to cancel the card while traveling: mega annoying when it was just because I was shopping earlier. 
**But I still have a rule when spending bitcoin**
I only spend bitcoin if it's more practical *(such as getting a discount)*. Orrrr if it's in real life, then I'd use it at a brick &amp; mortor shop.

But the thing is: I think with minimal guidance a mom really could do this. For example:
*  downloading the file is just like downloading anything else on the internet: check
*  making a LiveOS can be done with one click via a program made for making the process easy: check
*  turn off computer: check
*  turn on computer holding option *(or another key, as this is the only part that requires any research to determine which button allows your computer to reboot)*
*  now your on Ubuntu, without even going on the internet you can download electrum safely with another one-click install: check
*  electrum will give you the option "generate new seed" right away when starting it: copy that on paper with a pen: check
That's it, no terminal needed and everything is already prepackaged and ready to be done with simple clicks. Definitely would be worth it to watch a YouTube video but definitely not above anyone's skill sets if they normally use the internet.
Is this as easy as coinbase? No of course not, but its definitely way more secure and gives you complete control of your savings without much technical know how. I think its worthwhile to make these methods understood and easy to follow because they really are not that difficult with all the tools built to avoid using the terminal. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 00:35:44
This is great! I have long been saying that there should be a way to incorporate tails into a cold storage solution.
I understand the most secure method is to keep the whole process offline; but would it still be relatively safe to send and receive BTC using the tor network? Is there a way to use a light bitcoin client and truecrypt for this process?

The whole point is for stability. Of course if bitcoin climbs then you loose, but not everyone has that opportunity to take that risk.
Even for regular situations this is useful: if I'm working with an international team and payout in bitcoin, I could hold the amount as a stable store or value and know that I'll have enough to pay my employees at the end of the month.

Can they buy and stop every method after Bitcoin? 
Assume that they were to out right ban and nuke Bitcoin; what's the consequence?
Some other decentralized currency rises up with the benefit of knowing how Bitcoin fell. It would be a large set back but if it's useful then it will be used. Especially if the government is aggressive, it creates more contempt for the government and desire to use subversive technologies. 
Thus the only method they could use is to try and erode the idea away. And that is much less straight forward

Not only are people stuck within it but also uninformed people see the high price and attempt to get into it. It's infuriating because GOX is messing with the bitcoin ecosystem in a way that will cause great harm once their exchange implodes. (Not that they have any real pull anyways, I don't know any smart trader who actually references GOX price seriously)
People should cut their losses and move out while they can. They have had ample warning to get out before hand and the constant trading going on gives me even less sympathy for those that remain in it.
The rising disparity just shows that those who lingered are already being screwed as more and more people are trying to get out.

Bitcoin is definitely the most useful in terms of having access to online services. Even if you have USD in argentina you don't have access to digitalize that.

Your correct, currently credit cards are much more error-friendly


As I said earlier, I do graphic design. I'll perform free drafts up to a point and the entire time is done with a watermark/shoddy quality. Thus I already expended the effort to make it and the other person helped me craft it to that point. 
I ask them to send over the payment and I remove the watermark. I'm likely to do so because it's minimal effort to remove the mark and they will pay because they like the way it looks and don't want to go through the trouble with someone else. 
Boom. Trustless transaction without worrying about chargebacks later which introduce a whole new web of concerns.


What are you talking about? Do higher prices not affect you or do you think you're isolated from the raised price to account for plastic membership, transaction, and chargeback fees/losses?


Cool, I personally just don't want to put my record for analysis years down the road. Bills work much better for the dark market. 


This last weekend I dropped my phone in the ocean: I recovered the backup onto my tablet without a problem when I returned back to the house at my leisure.
With bitcoin I can take precautions so that I never lose access to my funds. With my credit card, if I make any purchases then later down the road randomly I could lose access to it for a week.
End of the world? No. But is it annoying? Absolutely.

I'm glad to see the community demand honest and better than market products.

If we are to push Bitcoin into developing nations, we really need to figure out ways to implement micro transactions. 5¢ may not be a big deal to most, but likely an amount too much to people in developing countries. 
Only route is through a counter party providing an off-block chain transaction system or wait a awhile for transactions to clear without the fee. 
Hopefully the first option becomes more feasible as more exchanges pop up around developing countries (

And your an asshole who decides to attack people because are pro actively trying to protect the network. 
What should we do? Wait until shit happens before we make any noise? GHash has done nothing to deserve this consideration, and their past actions makes their growing mining power of concern. 
The scary part isn't even solely GHash, as once bitcoin gains centralization then its open to be disrupted by anyone disrupting GHash. What kind of global network would we be if our weakest link was a sole mining company? 
Again, stop being a prick calling people nutjobs for being concerned. You clearly have no idea of the larger implications based on your lack of knowledge of Ghash's history and implications. You state that GHash wouldn't compromise the network yet I just gave you prove that they have acted unhonestly in the past (so why are you so damn confident in them?)

You are incorrect. Bitcoin prevents any hack from affecting it's customers. If I paid in bitcoin then it is impossible for a hacker to take more of the money from the wallet I spent from (much less other wallets I might have).
And if I were to have sent a payment with bitcoin, I could very easily use the transaction ID from the transparent and public blockchain to prove my payment. That's the best kind of claim one can use. 
Also BitPay has amazing support with coinbase catching up, an error with these providers would be easily remedied.

Decent read but this author really has an obvious agenda. It's nice to see though that these types of critiques are becoming less "this is a ponzi scheme" and drifting towards "move along, not that great, just an internet store of value thingy".

I'm so happy to see the community demand such stringent accounting measures. Especially after GOX, exchanges should be held to the most transparent measures. 
Mike Hearn is a great guy but definitely is not an auditor nor is he impartial (should be a private firm not bitcoin developers). I hope other exchanges see this an implement proper transparent fiat AND bitcoin audits at regular or random intervals

No, VMs are not secure enough. If your host computer can view the VM (which it does to let you use it) then the VM is compromised to the same security weak-links of your host.

1 mBTC = 1 kBit = 1000 bits
.1 mBTC = .1 kBit = 100 bits
Works for me. Originally I was a mBTC fan (I called them milibits in person and yes I realized that's incorrect now) yet bits began to grow on me in terms of tipping. 
1000 bits seems so much more rewarding than 1 mBTC
100 bits is trivial yet seems noteworthy compared to .1 mBTC
All anecdotal of course.

Not quite, I also probably have some facts very generalized. I'm sure people with much more understanding have some qualms with a statement or two I've had.

I dunno about everyone else but companies that advertise on here certainly get some attention. A small business that makes "Go" board game sets advertised recently and I just bought a small set from them.
Just depends on who you reach and if bitcoiners would be interested in your service. The benefit right now is that there are not too much competitors so you have blue oceans to make a mark, but its still not as easy as just saying you accept bitcoin. You still have to work for it

Its absolutely insane. GHash is literally another GOX: some evil CEO using the power of countless bitcoiners under their wing. 
So many miners have come to defend GHash despite the pool deserving NO credit of being a positive contribution to the community. I would understand their anger if the pool they were with was taking measures against gaining control of the network. 
Yet GHash has remained silent, has a track record of being sleezy and abusive towards the network, and has YET to take any responsibility.
Seriously let's burn GHash to the ground. I'm tired of companies taking advantage of the bitcoin sphere thinking they can pretend to be legitimate while massively being assholes. 
I really hope their track record can be more publicised. Hopefully less miners would be willing to stick with a mining network that was used to double spend gambling sites in the past (haven't even reached 51% and a rouge employee can hack your servers towards their benefit? Wtf!? That's exactly why they shouldnt have 51%!!!!!!!!!!)
@_date: 2014-02-17 21:20:59
It's unfortunate that you had to wait so long; but that is no fault on you. The merchant should have allowed for zero-confirmations, considering the need for instant payments and increasingly unlikely event of a double spend.
Would you happen to have the name of this establishment? I'm sure someone here could write a helpful email how to improve their setup to increase customer satisfaction.
@_date: 2014-06-15 21:48:35
GHash was discovered to be going on various gambling sites, making bets, and then reversing the losses.
I don't care who you are, but that should be a major red flag that at the very least this company SHOULD NOT hold 51% of the network.
If they are unable to handle even a marginal form of responsibility, what would stop "a rouge employee" *(that was their excuse)* from abusing their pool? 
As for mitigation efforts: this is the PR they used to maintain a good image while they were gaining popularity. They lied. They lied to get customers. 
I'm nnot saying a business is forced to be held to their promises or should be shut down -- but individuals looking to cloud mine should seriously investigate alternatives like PetaMine that cloud mine on P2Pool networks at the very least. GHash is a short term profitable route to long term failure. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:37:28
I've posted onto other forums, but I think the [Tails]( project would definitely aid the bitcoin community.


* use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network;
* leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
* use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.
By having a kit with dedicated bitcoin tools, anyone would be able to safely engage in bitcoin operations on an insecure machine. Plus, it would allow anyone to create a secure tool for relatively cheap and compliment security methods such as paper wallets and cryptocards (you can access them with increased peace of mind). 
I think on top of TREZOR, we need to encourage open sourced methods that anyone can access and DIY. I've already emailed the creator of Tails without response yet, but it's open sourced and could be forked to include more/different tools to suit bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 20:33:24

* You can try finding your local state/providence/city subreddits and tip conversations/information you find valuable. I've been able to start conversations explaining bitcoin through this.
Such much possibilities. I love using "bits" as it makes small amounts look grand and you can get creative with it! 
For example

Maybe you could use multi-sig, using a similar setup for how DarkWallet looks.
Make a new wallet in which the user holds two keys, and the website holds 1. The website then will trigger a spend which will activate when the customer gives permission. This way a customer can simply be given a notification that they click "ok".
This maintains Bitcoin's commitment to keeping the funds in control of the User while still giving similar easy of use for reoccurring transactions. 
Just a thought and I'm no expert.

Venmo offers free transactions with the same model as 1)

I think this is brilliant and a step in the right direction but I have a few nagging doubts. How should someone claim the asset stated in the colored coin? 
As in if I give you 1 mBTC that says you own my car; what force is there to make this reconcile?
Can color coins be used to simplify legal processes? As in instead of lengthy contracts and terms; you simply transfer CC and then write a small and quick contract statement relating to owner of the CC?

OP thank you for bringing up this topic point, and detractors I thank you for your passion.
As bitcoin approaches mainstream; we will need to appeal to a variety of different groups with different obstacles and frustrations. Thankfully bitcoin is just a mathematical protocol, and the theme behind it can really fit into whatever paradigm the people using it use. 
Thus I think context is king; and understanding the variety of benefits bitcoin brings allows you to talk in front of many different audiences effectively. 
Some individuals may not be concerned with the government; so to avoid falling on deaf ears the OPs argument is great!
Other individuals may be very aware of the increasing government presence in things they should be; and thus the government-agnostic advantages of bitcoin would immediately grab attention.
For merchants? Ignore both of those arguments and educate about the decreased costs, eliminated chargebacks, international market access etc.
**Context is King**, the conversations in this thread are golden.

So here's a quick breakdown.
**Would you like to easily buy and sell bitcoin safely from your bank account? With minimal effort?**
Coinbase would be your best bet here, and they have gone through incredible legal investments to get that licence.
**Would you like to use cash to get bitcoin?**
Local Bitcoin and Mycellium Local Trader let you exchange bitcoin for cash. Essentially you organize a deal with someone who has bitcoin, and you give them cash. Both of these websites use an escrow to prevent scams and fraud. 
If you don't wish to meet a person, most of these offers allow for bank deposits to other accounts.
**Bitcoin ATMS?**
Currently companies are setting up bitcoin ATMs left and right. They still are not everywhere, but you can find the growing [map here](
**Do you wish to move semi-large amounts of bitcoin in and out of your bank account?**
You'd likely wish to use an exchange. If so, CampBX and Kraken are both two well reputed US companies. Bitstamp is the industry leader located in eastern Europe.
*I hope this could help!*

A little bit off topic, but while talking about secure ways to handle bitcoin:
If you purchase a [cryptocard]( with an encrypted BIP password you can use it as a more secure hotwallet. 
On android you can use the "cold storage" option on mycelium to scan the code, decrypt the wallet with a passcode, and make a send all within volatile memory (so your keys aren't stored on the phone). 
While this isn't going to stop ALL hackers, it's definitely a step in the right direction. 
Does apple's breadwallet have a similar feature?
@_date: 2014-12-24 15:31:26
Cheap price? This thing costs close to $75 in total to have it shipped to the US. 
Considering the Trezor is $120 with free shipping, a $45 lesser price isn't exactly bring bitcoin security to the masses.

Simply out of curiosity on my end, why the hell do you have coins on gox?
When other exchanges were $100s of dollars behind did you think this was because they were inferior? When the community was railing against Gox for months and suggested users pulling funds out; why would you leave an amount where 10 BTC is no big deal?
I'm sorry but its really hard for me to find sympathy. There was adequate warnings to pull out and its ludacris to trust someone with that much money with all that distrust in the air.
I'm sorry but I for one am happy mt gox is out of the equation. Without gox the market has truly matured.

Venmo is nothing more than a VC subsidized attempt to make a money platform popular enough to make it worth it. Not that this can't work, but it's a much different model, currently it's not sustainable. Venmo hopes that merchants will adopt their system because so many college students are on it. That's how they plan to make money. 
Also this doesn't expand outside the US.
Does Venmo use the reserves deposited on their services to invest in low-risk investments? In order to make money off their free transaction network?

I think the ability to sell extra hashing power is an awesome addition to bitcoin. The only negative is that one entity is in control of this. 
Yet the exchange of hash rate is a great way to add liquidity to mining making it easy for miners to subsidize their equipment and new people to get a small piece of the action.
It would be awesome to create a decentralized exchange between independent miners and bitcoiners. It would give miners a tool to maintain profitability in a risky market. 
Again though, the only reason this is bad now is because one company is in control of all these machines and hash being sold.

I do not trust cloud providers in the slightest. I assume that any information I put up onto the cloud can be stolen and thus I only place wallets encrypted in TrueCrypt containers onto the cloud. 
I do this as a form of backup incase my physical copies fail/break/lost etc. 
Yet, the problem with encrypted wallets is that I make them insecure when I open them on a non-secure machine. Thus, having a secure environment to decrypt and encrypt wallets would be an amazing tool.

You realize if a p2p pool began to become a significant piece of the mining pie that it would solve this problem? Even if a p2p pool had 51% there would be no issue, and even rewards miners better. 
The security model of bitcoin is not meant to be absolutely perfect,  but rather a significant improvement of the current system. Thus its security measures shouldn't be expected to be flawless because there are ways to work with it and still maintain the network and security

I'm actually not experienced enough with Linux distros to tell you the difference. If you are already comfortable with your preferred distros then you likely know what your doing in this realm :)
I just suggested Ubuntu because you can access electrum directly from the software center which makes validating the file is not tampered much less work. 
If your really gunning for security; I'd reccomend doing this[ all on tails]( It has a lot of great tools built into the OS, and you can do this process with electrum rather then armory for an easier method.
Good luck! And remember to test your method MULTIPLE times; creating and recovering the wallet! Don't put significant savings until you've practiced it a few times. When dealing with large amounts of money, extra precaution creates peace of mind :)

It was gaining stem when we could have profiles on bitmit. It was actually beggining to pick up and more and more cards were available as time went on.

Yikes, yeah Facebook groups don't even come close to the way Google integrates circles. It doesn't have nearly the same filtering or easy sharing (I can share to multiple circles if the content intersects). Circles aren't groups you join, its the way you categorize your friendly groups so that when you share information you have easy to access "tags" to share it with relevant people. I don't have to invite anyone to my "circle" I just add them to mine and then share with them accordingly. Significantly different from groups, which Google also has (communities are the equal to groups)
And I really don't care that you don't use it, but you began this conversation with extreme disbelief that someone was using Google plus rather then Facebook. I was explaining why I prefer Google by far and that there is more then plenty of activity on the network. Its only getting bigger.

Well hopefully we can make solutions that make it almost or just as successful to mine on P2Pools. 
Some pool operators are building tools to allow the community to donate towards p2pools which would subsidize smaller p2pools while they build up their hashrate. 
Yet I would suggest you follow this topic closely and evaluate your risks. If your not in Bitcoin for the long run and simply wanted to buy machines to make money, then I can't do anything to convince you to switch pools despite temporary losses. 
Yet if you want bitcoin to succeed and participate in for the long run, then it would be great if you joined the discussion to look for alternatives that don't compromise the long-term security of the network.

Oops, I see where the confusion is: I definitely didn't phrase that correctly.
I mean that people will join Google plus but then refuse to follow their favorite sport teams, news casters, companies, celebrities, (and in my situation a ton of bitcoin, Linux, and open source devs) along with friends that also have Google plus accounts.
Thus people go to their homepage and don't see anything, and then ridicule it on other networks.
I meant to say a lot of people are quick to ridicule it before giving it a fair shot. After I played with it a bit I really don't want to use any other network, I find Google plus a great way to discover news and engage in discussion with a global community. Its setup is very unique compared to Facebook and twitter, allowing more people to discover other new people then establishing a page of dedicated friends.

What? I'm not trying to sound smart. But bitcoin is more than that. Buffet is focused on a very specific function of the technology as if that's all it is. But that's not an issue, he doesn't delve into technology for investments so it's not like he's stupid for not delving. I'm not even remotely saying that.
Can you build decentralized cloud storage, smart auto-completing contracts, equity tokens, notary, and other various extensive functions that rely on a single source of truth (a global decentralized ledger). 
This is what I'm talking about. If bitcoin was purely just sending money then it wouldn't be that big of a deal. It's the ecosystem that it allows for which is so valuable because things can be built on top of bitcoin. You can't build on top of checks.

*Businesses already offer the option to perform automatic deposits correct?*
With this in mind, I think a business could penetrate the market by offering services to employees rather then employer. I think it would be harder to convince an employer to switch payroll methods then convincing a single individual to desire this option.
Thus perhaps have a business that let's employees use the service's bank account routing number for direct deposits and then have this company automatically convert a % to bitcoin and the rest to your bank account. 
If this idea sees popularity, then perhaps the company offering this service can have merchant solutions to add scaleability later on.
Just some thoughts, I think this service will become a reality within the next year or so.

**How to use Bitcoin in games without exposing the game economy to volatility**
Step 1: Create game tokens using Counterparty.
Step 2: Sell game tokens for USD/BTC at a constant price.
Now consumers can enter your game economy and buy the tokens using bitcoin/USD/or whatever. Yet instead of being exposed to the events happening around these currencies, they are merely gates into your game economy. 
*Plus then users can trade coins amongst each other and your game will develop a market of its own.*

Here is the thing about China news; it could be real, it could be fake. Considering all their economic decisions are carried out behind closed doors it's truly impossible to see true intentions. 
Thus their added volume to bitcoin means all this uncertainty is going to be part of our ecosystem until other countries catch up in frequency of trading and volume. 
**Most likely**, all China news is likely orchestrated by the Chinese Government in an attempt to manipulate bitcoin the best they can. They likely understood the rise in value with China's promotion initially and thus they put themselves in a good position to have effect on the market later. This is being seen now.
Because China can't outright ban bitcoin, it will do it's best to manipulate the price via it's massive influence over a large market segment of bitcoiners. Thus until we catch up in volume, China will still have this affect.
Yet, as time goes on and patterns become evident; traders will have more doubt about the news compared with past history. Unfortunately we need time to foster a trust in the bitcoin network, other countries, etc. Only then will news from China worry short-term traders less.

*  download and make a live OS CD of some Linux distro (tails/Ubuntu/whatever)
*  boot up computer with live os: download electrum
*  generate seed and copy it down on paper (or in a text file and encrypt it with another password)
*  store the paper safely or your encrypted text file with the seed on cloud storage
*  copy the master public key.
Now you can shut everything down and if you have the piece of paper/encrypted text you can access this wallet.
You can send bitcoins to it via the public addresses generated by the master public key, and recover using the seed.

Especially the way it searches for hastags and then finds similar discussions elsewhere, the networking experience is totally unmatched by facebook.
But again, I'm not trying to turn this into a flame war. I really don't care what you use, I just really enjoy using Google plus, and it's better since I have an android phone.

I think this is a bit much to ask initial users. It's the safest option but there are better methods that are a bit more user friendly.
I'd promote that similar safety lesson by suggesting using electrum and writing down the given 12 words for coins wishing to be protected.
In fact I don't think its mentioned enough that there is major room for wallet innovations. We need bitcoin wallets to be secure on insecure machines and user friendly to instill the confidence needed to encourage mass adoption.
There is a limiting factor when it security is scary for individuals who are focused on fields other then computer security.

I'm fascinated by the [Tails project](


*  use the Internet anonymously and circumvent censorship;
all connections to the Internet are forced to go through the Tor network;
*  leave no trace on the computer you are using unless you ask it explicitly;
*  use state-of-the-art cryptographic tools to encrypt your files, emails and instant messaging.
I think this type of technology can be utilized to make an easy to use bitcoin banking environment with all the tools to safely handle en &amp; decryption as well as sending funds securely. 
Right now it takes way to much effort to secure bitcoin. I think if we can easily create a tool to create and access encyrpted wallets securely, it would both compliment and remove the need for paper wallets which are not accessible to everyone.
*(plus paper wallets printed from a printer will likely have the printed memory saved onto a printer, thus meaning it's still not as %100 secure as most think)*

I think BlisterPool offers dev coin merge, and namecoin is easy to implement - many have namecoin merge-mining. 
I definitely understand your need for UK based operation though as P2Pool mining benefits from less latency. Any P2Pool operators scanning these conversations? This is one hell of a marketing opportunity to snatch up new customers asking questions :)

Does this have the same function that mycelium has for cold storage?
On mycelium, you can spend from a cold storage wallet by scanning a qr code and putting in the password -- the file is only held in ram/volatile memory and is deleted after a transaction. It properly handles change addresses by making sure to send the bitcoin back to the original wallet it came from to avoid change addresses losing your bitcoin. 
Does this iphone wallet do the same?
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:44:22
I like your idea of trying to get consumers to move towards a transaction network with less costs; yet I think there is a better way.
How about instead, you still accept various methods; but discount heavily for bitcoin. This way people see the price difference if they use bitcoin and there is a natural incentive to investigate.

Great point, yet these monopolies take significant funding to maintain resilience. This isn't an issue to the monopoly because of their profits, yet all the bureaucratic and bloat that comes from such a large organizations definitely is passed down. 
Decentralized organizations aren't nearly as strong off the bat. Yet the more they are beat up and patched up by community effort (which comes from being beat up: negative press is still press), these anti-fragile systems build communities behind it that scales much more efficiently and cheaper then profitable alternatives. 
Also when decentralized organizations or tech is made, it allows other technology to be made on top of it; whether it's centralized or not. 


I understand that, and I'm not saying Napster was bad. But the napster model was not sustainable to a forceful shutdown (by government), yet the demand for free file sharing still existed. Thus from the ashes rose torrents. 
They definitely were not as easy to use or find after the immediate crash of napster; but today's implementation is by far more superior then what napster offered until 2001. 


I'm not arguing monopolies or industries in which there is little competition; I'm arguing about the structure that makes up the organizations that meet this type of threshold. 
Wikipedia is very much the monopoly of information on the net. Yet that's because it's structured by a small group of volunteers to maintain a website that is edited by professionals around the world voluntarily.
Sure there is a core dev team that builds bots and website updates, yet the entire project is funded by donations and contributions by knowledgable people having edit-wars to get the best knowledge out.

Lol this made me laugh so hard. In a good way, a good chuckle :)
I don't want a bubble any time soon; that's when people get careless and building becomes lazy. Tough times show that bitcoin needs to have more utility and use to encourage more demand; enough said.
Already today we have features and services today that didn't exist as of last year and I hope that trend is exponential. Today I actually use my bitcoin to buy stuff because of services like purse.io, newegg discounts, mycelium trader, more gyft locations, and [coinforcoffee]( mean I actually get significant savings by using bitcoin. Up to 25% and usually around 10-20% on average. 
Thus for me bitcoin is more secure to use and it's cheaper -- thus as a bitcoiner I'm encouraged to at least buy bitcoin before purchases because it has real world use. 
We need more of this and **then** some. As long as this keeps happening I don't care if the price keeps dropping because the ecosystem and use with bitcoin grows. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:18:51
While that's the exact scenario that bitcoiners would likely want, I want to commend you for looking for sustainable methods for Wikipedia.
I have used the site countless times to gather information for personal and education gain. It's an amazing archive and I thank you guys for running and sustaining it. Wikipedia is literally the world's information in the palm of everyone's hand.
*Keep doing what's best for the archive of all knowledge.

The problem that exists with this is that it would essentially require a hard fork to include these new coins and make them compatible with bitcoin.

Interesting point; a double spend can only originate from the sender correct?
If an individual double-spent their purchase at a store; they would likely be one of the few using bitcoin and thus very noticeable.

Right, I agree that insecure wallets are insecure; but that is separate from paying with them. Because a user sends out payments rather then entering sensitive details; the most a hack could be is a man in the middle which replaces the QR code with their own.
Even in this situation, a user could use their transaction ID to show what happened and could carry a dialogue through that. Credit cards provide this service by spending tons of money on insurance against fraud and is why they charge such exorbitant fees for money transmitting. 
Thus I still stand by my case that it is literally impossible to hack someone's bitcoin wealth through a payment window. Bitcoins' are made for internet transactions and provide customers a complete safety against an individual using that information to steal their wealth. 
Exchanges which hold individual's bitcoins are not the same as paying a store bitcoins that you own. These are two completely different situations. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:31:43
Okay well let's back up here. You requested that pieces be in USD to make conversion easy.
I think that would be a terrible idea to implement because it takes out the global aspect of this technology. 
If someone wants to see USD on open bazaar, that would be minimal work to make it work for your client. Whether its a plugin, script, or whatever.

Banks enable you to secure wealth, transfer it, and makes loans to the community.
Bitcoin solves 2/3s of this problem, and loaning is already being alternatively tested through programs like kickstarter.
If your going to compare BitPay and Mastercard then there is still a very obvious winner. Bitpay lets you play flat monthly rates in order to have FREE bitcoin to USD conversion and transfer to bank accounts.
Bitcoin has made it cheaper to put USD in your bank account then USD has in the past.
Consumer protection can easily be built using bitcoin should people desire it.

I don't want to insult you by asking, but are you positive that everything was working properly on your end? I don't mine so you know way more than myself, yet have you had discussions with other miners on the same pool to see if everything was working correctly?
And if you were, was your contribution enough to merit donations? I noticed that at BlisterPool donations have different thresholds which allow the donation to be less and spread further, or more and given to the top miners. 
**I think the donation model for P2Pools still needs to be improved**
Yet it's fantastic that certain pool operators were able to make the tools available so quickly. 
Ideally though the donation page can be simplified to a unique QR code per donater *(electrum master seed with master public seed)* that allows any amount of bitcoin to be donated and *by default* be spread to the maximum amount of possible miners active on the pool. 
Currently there is a .01 BTC minimum which I think is a bit steep and turns a lot of people away. It would be much better to allow for small tips to be collected until they reach a certain threshold to be dispersed to miners.

Coinbase has gone through extensive effort to maintain compliancy and legitimacy with the US Government (located in San Fran). They have also attracted large investments and have become somewhat of the bitcoin giant in the US which serves a large volume of consumers **and** merchants. 
**But it's good that you are suspicious!**
It's important that people take caution when trusting companies they haven't heard of. Although personally I would say you won't have any problems buying and selling bitcoin through coinbase with a US bank account.
Yet if you wish to store your coins; I would advise a method that gives you more control. I would recommend offline storage, which involves printing pieces of paper or using [two USB sticks]( 
*Yet some individuals still want to be able to access their funds online*
Thus services such as [GreenAddress]( and [Blockchain]( can serve for moderate amount of protection whilst still holding your funds online. 
**tl;dr? Coinbase is great for buying/selling bitcoin with your US bank account. Yet for secure storage, there are better services, applications, and methods available.**
@_date: 2014-08-16 18:22:17
This kind of blows my mind; because the effect this has is people saving money until they can find a better investment/purchase. 
Thus people are insulated against certain economic uncertainties when saving is encouraged.
Plus it's not like when people save money that nothing is being purchased or consumed. It's a continuum, some people conserve their spending for later and others have already been saving from earlier and are confident to make a purchase now. 
Like the article says, there is good/bad deflation just like good/bad inflation.

Absolutely no problem in that, your totally right in the fact that you don't expect anything to happen and it's the same as buying a $1 lottery ticket for fun. 
Yet at the same time, if we got people like you *(willing to buy a small [USB miner]( were to all point them towards a p2pool, you'd help secure the network by grouping together. This encourages others to join the pool as it grows larger and variance *(the volatility in payouts, smaller pools have less consistent payouts (sometimes larger, sometimes smaller))* slowly dwindles. 
You do your thing and have fun doing it, but it would be great to get people to join p2pools with small miners. It won't do much individually, but together could slowly add up hashing power.
Think of the developers who would release wallpaper apps with miners hidden in the background. They were mining small amounts from everyone's phones to make a sizable pool. 
We can use this same logic for good :)

Bitcoin has already passed that test. Merchants can easily accept bitcoin with low risk and since that question has already been answered -- further merchants aren't going to impact peoples view of it.

I'm a bit confused; wouldn't more miners pointing their machines towards p2pools increasing their hashing power and thus more likely to find blocks?
When other miners see P2Pools raising in hash power percentage, they are more likely to join then if they never find blocks.

I like the idea your onto. If you can make your idea soundproof and yet simple to do and retain, then with a nice wrapper it can encourage more trusted ways to store bitcoin.

When we simplify security, we encourage more people to get into bitcoin and protect those in it.

Fair enough, I knew Xapo wasn't available in the US but I assumed low income workers have similar problems with banks as in America. And I'm talking about low income workers because they are normally at a disadvantage because the banking system doesn't cope with the problems of poverty.
It's free to open an account in America too, yet:
*  you need government documents/licenses *(not everyone has these)*
*  you need to hold minimum balances *(doesn't work if you live paycheck to paycheck)*
* banking deposit delays means it's easy to accidentally overdraw your account
*  the IRS can levy unpaid taxes and withdraw amounts from your account *(really sucks for people living paycheck to paycheck)*
*  Family members don't have bank accounts so there is confusion/inability to navigate through through the bureaucracy.
Thus many low income workers opt out of banks and deal with the inconveniences &amp; fees of cash *(money orders, check cashing, H&amp;R Block prepaid debit cards)* in order to avoid the issues I listed with banks. 
For this reason I see Xapo as being useful. If you manage to get your documentation through then you can essentially spend your money with the ease of banking without being banked.

I don't think this would take off.
I'm trying to attract a crowd that potentially has no idea what bitcoin is. Much less do I expect them to own any bitcoin themselves (or know where to get it). I want them to pick up an item and then understand what bitcoin is and see it's benefits.
My way to do this was to have an individual stumble upon a paper wallet (which shows bitcoin can be offline and on paper), make a wallet of their choosing from a tutorial, and then sweep the funds (using address IDs and sending money). 
At this point, the individual knows mostly everything there is to know about bitcoin, and even has some in possession. This way they would be comfortable if someone asked them a question about it or if they wanted to buy more themselves.
I want to create a bitcoin presence on campus by having everyone involved. I don't think having the proceeds go towards one winner would encourage this, much less anyone be interested.

Thanks for describing this to me, I'm sure I'm not the only person who learned somethung from that. Here's 100 bits +More questions:
*  is the payout period a reflection of no one using it? As in if more join would a p2pool have daily gains? Or is it the way it's built?
*  can merge mining be added to p2pools? And what's the benefit? Do people like holding a small bit of namecoin or is it purely to get more money out of their hashing power (as in if namecoin is more profitable to split hashing power to).
*  can all the current annoyances with P2Pools be surpassed with open source development?
Seriously its frustrating enough seeing Ghash own 30% of the network and make no attempts to their end to decentralize the gains. Its really paramount we encourage the community to start switching over.
To simply say leave Ghash is irresponsible, an alternative needs to be available and that alternative is p2pools. 
If P2Pools can break "critical mass" to have enough miners to incentivize more to join, it would seriously help against these worries in the future. 
@_date: 2014-07-28 15:48:01
You do realize your argument is based off of mt gox trading above market rate? The bitcoin community was well aware of this before the crash and constantly told people to.move away from that exchange. 
There are other exchanges available which competed with GOX and allowed full withdrawals and deposits that complied with KYC/AML. 
To say its all fraud is ridiculous because mt GOX was NOT THE ENTIRE BITCOIN EXCHANGE. 
There were plenty of others that allowed people to cash out and buy in all along the history bitcoin has had.

Bitmarkets has the benefit of being already out, but OpenBazaar looks a TON more customizable. 
For example: I want to sell magic cards using bitcoin. The biggest annoyance on BitMit was that there were no MTG filters (color of card, type of card, creature attack/defence, etc). 
Thus on BitMit there were tons of cards yet with no browse mechanism. There were over 200 listings of MTG cards but you couldn't easily browse through them which limited people's desire to post anyways.

This is crazy. Seriously it's ridiculous that hackers can access funds despite 2FA; the community should really look into making these types of events less common.
It's also amazing that coinbase doesn't have a verification email for large sends. This way if a coinbase account was compromised then atleast a secured gmail would make it more difficult.
In light of these events coinbase should get on this feature **pronto.** 
It's one thing to read about people not using secure web wallets without 2FA; but it's ridiculous seeing individuals getting hacked when following all the normal precautions. This will hinder adoption if not addressed. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:23:04
honestly here is my personal opinion on the Doge vs LTC from the perspective of an individual who holds neither:
LTC is a copy of BTC without much inherent advantages considering faster block comes with more orphan blocks, I see ASIC script not out of technological innovation, and the silver to BTC is simply a smaller denomination of BTC.
The only reason individuals used silver over gold is because it would be physically impractical to have small specks of gold that could easily get lost. BTC can be used up to 8 decimal places.
**This is why I think doge has the advantage**
By not setting a cap, it's not competing with BTC. It's a completely different vehicle because it's experimenting with a different economic principle. I would say that gives it more of a chance then LTC to compete or compliment BTC. 
Especially since it's community is where individuals go to easily learn about crypto currency.

I'll have a go at this; you bring some very valid concerns, yet I disagree with a few.


I've seen this argument very often. It confuses me because **payments on the bitcoin network are instant**, I've never had to wait more then perhaps 5-10 seconds to see a transaction appear. Especially in the situation of a supermarket, where transactions would be done from a mobile phone, making the need for confirmations less relevant.
Now not every transaction should be done without confirmations; yet this lets retailers decide the preferred risk/speediness at their choosing.
* For dinners, supermarkets, drinks; **use zero confirmations**.
* Buying computers, houses, cars; **use a few confirmations.**


I absolutely, 100% agree with you on this. In business terms, this is a blue ocean and I'm waiting for the first few decentralized and centralized solutions for maintaining security, even if on an insecure device.
There exists several ways to do this within the bitcoin protocol, as the m-of-n property has yet to be fully utilized (in my opinion there are way more uses for this then are currently being used by entrepreneurs, etc)


I understand your concerns with community reaction after GOX. Yet I disagree in your spite. You fail to realize that individuals have been warning about MtGOX FOR A YEAR. Any mention of MTGOX would immediately generate hostile reactions from community members. Thus once it went down and there was a flood of unhappy GOX users, it sort of fell on deaf ears. 
Yet your wrong about the unregulated nature of Bitcoin. There are COUNTLESS exchanges out there besides BTC-E and unregulated clones. Bitstamp has maintained a dedication towards business transparency, and the exchanges within US jurisdiction (Kraken, CampBX, CoinSettler, ButterCoin, etc) are all under US money transmitter regulations. It's up to the users to select which exchanges they use, but there are a litany of good options when it comes to day trading BTC.
**Yet I would like to point out** that the exchanges are only catering to a small group of bitcoiners. The majority of us have never been on an exchange and prefer to simply buy from LocalBitcoins/CoinBase/Bitonic.nl, etc and then hold or spend for regular day purchases.
Again though, these are blue waters and an exchange that figures out how to allow for a scalable market with trustless controls will become the winner. Whether it's a centralized solution or not.


This is a tricky topic as it flips the paradigm of digital selling as we know it. Currently Merchants have a disincentive to sell online because of chargebacks. Additionally there are no avenues for merchants to chase down customers that fraud them with these transactions.
Yet when flipping this equation around it requires consumers to trust the vendor they are buying from. This allows for more fraudulent businesses, yet also protects good vendors from bad consumers. 
You also fail to mention that bitcoin saves consumers from having to give up private financial credit card information. Even though the CC company will followup with fraudulent activity, I do not want to expose myself to risk or go through the process of getting new cards when I can shop with confidence using bitcoin. This is a huge consumer benefit and protection built into the system.
Perhaps this could be another blue ocean though. A company like BitPay can be a neutral 3rd party until the good is shipped to reduce fraud. 
**tl;dr: I think all the problems you listed are either not issues, or are realms where multiple companies can compete to provide the convenience. Long-term I find this making the market more stable, diverse, and have much more financial options then we do now, as well as including much more people into this system.**

Just because bitcoin doesn't need counterparties doesn't mean the tech can't be used in other instances. Nor does it mean this option shouldn't be explored.
Yes counterparty risk means there exists risk: yet to have this sort of stability tool is next level useful.

It's a damn shame you lost your money but the admins of have no control over the wiki. It's simply a resource that anyone in the world can contribute to, similar to another wikipedia page.
The admins probably thought an open source article would be a good way for the community to crowdsource a description page. The problem with this though is that there is no one in charge of this page, to lock it down means that it would not exist (since no one really owns it). 
This is the unfortunate reasoning for "Buyer Beware" as in it would have been reasonable to try out the service with small amounts; or researching what people say.

As in due to the amount of bitcoin being "minted" is done so at a rate slower then the demand for it.
There are plenty of explanations about the deflationary nature of bitcoin (similar to gold) and could probably be explained better then I could. 
But in a nutshell, because bitcoin is worth more later: it encourages saving and thus current consumption is done on a much more frugal nature. Yet I have still used my bitcoin to buy a variety of products. Especially after seeing the value appreciate and receiving extra buying power from the same amount of coin.

Inflation should no longer be considered "normal" or "good" for society. Its definitely time to investigate exactly how this method of economic stabilization affects the middle class. 
In my opinion this kills the middle class slowly by making their savings worth less and less over time. Middle class is the savers and thus are hit hardest by inflation.
People with many assets are making above the inflation rate and  pay 15% on this income versus 35% on a high paid middle class worker.

This is the reason I get a bit tiresome of "we need to make the network asic resistant!" because I personally think ASICs show that this bitcoin thing can really work. 
If bitcoin is to compete with the server farms of VISA/MasterCard/PayPal then we can't do it on gaming computers, we need dedicated machines that process transactions efficiently. The mining race is great because it pushes the industry to develop decentralized alternatives to the current server farm implementation *(by having different server farms run by different people and also people working with others online :P)*

I think counterparty is amazing because it allows literally anyone to have the same type of capital raising vehicles as large publicly traded companies.
For example. A small restaurant needs funds to accommodate increased demand. They issue a Crypto equity with promised dividends, etc. Now people can buy up these Crypto shares and get reward later if the restaurant does well by cashing out their ownership.
By taking out the middlemen, I think these types of tools will make it much easier for communities to invest in its surrounding infrastructure while benefiting from doing so.

Apple has been the last to the game in terms of providing modern payment solutions.

here's some wallet tips:
We can use methods your used to.
* Spendable wallet (Checking Acct)
* Cold Storage (Savings Acct)
It would be totally fine to use coinbase or some web wallet for your daily use. Yet when your amounts begin to exceed safe hot-wallet values (whatever threshold your comfortable losing), you can simply send to your cold storage.
**How to make cold storage**
I'd recommend using Electrum. It's impossible to "lose" wallets generated from a seed (like you see on multibit) and you can write down the code easily on a piece of paper.
While your computer is likely not infected by a keylogger/virus; I'd recommend making a [live-cd]( just to be sure you can start with a fresh slate.
If you installed Ubuntu, you can simply use the software center and install [Electrum]( from there directly. Open up the program and generate a wallet; it will give you 12 random words *(write these down on paper!)*. Then copy down the public address (picture of qr code would work). 
**Now delete everything and shut 'er all down**
You should now have a really safe cold storage wallet. Scan the QR code to "save", and be sure to keep that piece of paper with the 12 words SUPER SAFE. **Never put these words online, or in a text file**
Before you start sending bitcoin to this wallet; try using the live-cd to download electrum again and load the seed you typed. Practice this a few times to be sure you did everything correctly. Don't send your self massive funds before testing this. 
Other then that though, that's it! You are now a bank with incredible cold storage security!

I like the way that you are thinking in that by removing money from the powers of government; they must be persuasive rather then violent in order to have peaceful tax collections.
While I'm iffy on this topic as taxes are what runs countries; I'm definitely in favor of rewriting the current tax laws within the US to make more sense. My political beliefs run from libertarian to liberal depending on the issue; and I think a progressive tax that puts less burden on the lower income brackets is positive.
Yet I think the way taxes are collected, and based off of self-reporting off income; is just absolutely absurd and could be done in a manner much less confusing and bureaucratic. 
Hopefully bitcoin will add enough friction to encourage governments to find more user-friendly and easier to collect tax systems that places less tension between government and citizens.

Lets get this straight, if you were to build a printer from scratch and printed paper wallets; it would be impossible for your wealth to be hacked. People using imperfect security will be taken advantage of. The NSA is compromising american made technology; but do they have mandate with every producer worldwide? 
And the bitcoin network is worth X billion dollars. I'll ignore your "not *really* secure" comment because as I said bitcoin has the most secure hashing algorithm we know today. This is proven by the fact that its source code is completely open for **everyone in the world** to peek inside and try and find bugs and hacks. Paypal, banking institutions, and others keep all their information closed off and they STILL get hacked. 
Bitcoin isnt *perfect* but it is by far the best damn improvement to both security and finance that is unparralled by any private effort. 
You clearly do not fully understand bitcoin or the potential vulnerabilities. You expect perfect of bitcoin when traditional finance is leagues less secure (thus the high fees to combat fraud).

Sorry if I took you out of context; let's restart
I say "Why pay for X service when you can do it yourself". Would this be considered insane or conspiracy theorist? Does including the word bank makes it seem crazy?
it's not even guerrilla marketing because it actively goes to disturb the customer to the point where they could potentially develop a stigma towards the message.
The point of guerilla marketing is to spread an idea; sometimes by shock or provoking words, but not something that is clean and politically safe. 
 don't know what you think marketing is, but marketing is delivering a message or product at the correct place, time, and needs of the customer all coincide
The time and place? I currently use bitcoin as an alternative to paying for a variety of services and I vastly think the benefits gained from it are superior to traditional banking and payment processing. What time should we wait for?
And frankly it comes off as a bit authoritative saying what is and isn't marketing. Your purely arguing semantics based off the wording of the title in order to degrade the legitimacy of a proposal. So because this "isn't" marketing it's not a valid way to spread an idea?


I really don't believe it would have any significance in my day really. I don't know too many people who would be genuinely pissed off to see something written on a dollar bill that has gone through various people. If anything, it might generate some curiosity; but no merchant would not accept a bill because it had something scribbled on the margins.

ASICS are only a few years old, hardly enough time for Economies of Scale to expand. Even large warehouses are having problems in terms of after a certain point you have extra costs like heating, employees, and slippage when selling large quantities of coin to make up daily operational costs. 
This has led to OTC partnerships and other deals to try and mitigate the risks but essentially the zero-sum game appears to be working. 
And also think about it this way: if we are going to build a global transaction system for other applications and infrastructure to be built on top of, I would hope that the network is steadfast (of which comes the benefits of the ASICS fight, much more security in the blockchain than beforehand). This network runs autonomously for anyone to freely use, which is much different than a closed off transaction network like paypal, mastercard, etc. 
Thus the benefits of this protocol, in my opinion, still greatly outweigh the "inequality" aspect. Sure, money allows greater participation in processing transactions, but anyone around the world can equally build on top of or use the network despite geography, nationality, creed, etc. Fleeting internet access is much more accessible on a global scale then fair banking institutions and payment networks.

Well hold on, let me get my technical stuff straight for my own good.
If a keylogger is installed and the hacker gains access to your codes and passwords. A 2FA would still protect the user unless the hacker hacked both accounts within seconds of the individual logging in.

Currently the bitcoin ecosystem is just recreating what already exists with USD. Merchant adoption, expanding what you can buy with btc, etc. 
Obviously this doesn't increase the price because people who use USD already have access to these infrastructures and then some. 
Yet this is still incredibly important for BTC because it's important for it to be able to be used at multiple places. 
**So what would attract people to bitcoin?**
I think the new protocols like Storj, Maidsafe, and OpenBazaar will user in a storm of new users once the ecosystem begins to develop around these systems. I can see many startups using these ecosystems to create businesses off of these services. 
Better yet is these ecosystems provide an experience unavailable to USD and would require the user to enter crypto in order to enter. 
**What else could be done?**
We need more exchanges in developing countries that are easy for the masses to access. Even if developing countries have internet access, there needs to be a different strategy at gaining adoption similar to how mPESA does so with a huge amount of brick &amp; mortor shops to enter the mPESA network. This strategy could be linked to bitcoin adoption with LBC or perhaps part of the exchanges. 
This would enable remittances to spring out as it would provide liquidity to perform low-cost transactions between countries. Currently there are many costs with doing this that make remittances not quite there yet for BTC (if you need to get fiat -&gt; fiat). 
***These services are still being built but until then doesn't attract new buyers***.

True, it's Merchants definitely receive an incentive to accept bitcoin directly.

Oh don't get me wrong, I love the fact that individuals place QR codes on images, videos, posters, etc and can get global donations. And I love showing off this main feature when explaining bitcoin to friends.
Yet I thought that by transferring wallets (with encryption through handshake to ensure security) both encouraged new wallets per spends/buys, didn't require confirmations (they literally have the bitcoin in their hands), and a few other features.
I could be wrong but I could have sworn this was discussed earlier on. I would love to have more information on it

**Situation: need confirmation**
Person A buys $300 worth of bitcoin from a Satoshi Square meetup; waiting 10-20 minutes for a few confirmations would not dissuade this process.
**Situation: need speed**
Person A is buying a hotdog/coffee/meal/gum/beer etc. The merchant should accept 0 confirmations; meaning they expect customers that pay using BTC for small transactions don't have the time or resources to perform a double spend. 
Your correct that confirmations are a topic worth being aware of, but I think it's unhelpful to state "the rule of thumb" to newcomers who don't know how to interpret it. Your correct he didn't state services; but even accepting bitcoin peer-to-peer I wouldn't expect to wait 6 confirmations (which could take up to an unnecessary hour)
With traditional credit cards you pay a percentage which lets you use their service and in return to get their fraud prevention mechanisms. Bitcoin allows you to engage with security by evaluating the tradeoff between speed and security.
For small transactions that prioritize speed over security (small counter purchases) then 0 confirmations allows buyers to instantly pay with BTC.
For larger transactions where waiting a few minutes to ensure security isn't a tradeoff: use a few confirmations (although I couldn't imagine needing more then 1-2). 
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:09:47
Hey there! This is great!
I've long been trying to get minecraft servers to accept bitcoin, and implement an ingame economy similar to EVE.
To avoid hacker incentive, I think the best way is for the user to have complete control of their keys at all time. Either they have their mobile phone with them, a plugin on their computer, or something else and the game simply displays QR codes. 
Orrrr.. the server itself could use a bitcoin plugin that uses multi-sig and nTimeLock features. Similar to certain web wallets, let the server initiate spending features with confirmation from the user. And coupled with nTimeLock means illegitimate spends can be stopped within a timeframe.
Is there anything you can do to lend your skills in this? I would love to get bitcoin into games where it can be more "fun" :)

First off... WHY ARE YOU ON MTGOX
I'm sorry for using caps but seriously they are by far the worst exchange out there with the community always warning against using them.
The reason they have a high price is because it's almost impossible to get money out from them, thus the price is inflated because individuals try to trade their BTC out of there.
Seriously there are tons of exchanges out there, I enjoy Kraken and didn't need much verification at all to trade my BTC for namecoin and other alts. But Bitstamp is another popular one that Coinbase uses regularly and has a much better track record. 
The community of has some great info on a daily basis as well that you might be interested in. 
tl;dr GET OFF GOX. YOU WILL NOT HAVE ANY POSITIVE EXPERIENCES TRADING WITH THEM. *Especially if you are new to bitcoin trading (as I'm guessing by your question.)*

The primary benefit would having complete control of your wealth. You can choose to use your bitcoin wallet with the server and easily withdraw to other servers or even your phone for buying a taco. At no point to you have to ask permission to move or have control of your own money. Also by going this route it could let servers develop fun plugins without worrying about making it super secure, since the server never has privilege to forcefully send funds. Only create structures to make it more seamless with gameplay.
Its about blurring the economies of a virtual Minecraft world and how we can use that on a daily basis.
It would definitely be a big experiment and I don't know if market principles would purely let this work smoothly but it would be fun to participate in none the less. **Thanks for asking poking questions!**
Tl;dr players have total control over their funds and thus servers don't have as large of a security risk

Bitmit was amazing, when I was starting the membership grew from nothing to 50 people in a few weeks. And of that 50, there was significant volume of magic singles on bitmit. 
Since then there has been no equivalent. 
Yet I don't think another centralized exchange is going to work.
Check out the OpenBazaar.org project. They are making a decentralized exchange meaning anyone would have access to make their own shop and no one controls it or gathers fees. 
It would be much better if you use your skills to help this project along and then implement it into whatever solution your trying to do.
Nothing wrong with a centralized exchange, but it would be better if this was based on top of a decentralized marketplace rather doing the whole thing as another bitmit.

Online I love using bitcoin vendors or snapcard where there isn't. I find the extra security and not linking purchases to my bank useful.

I can't believe no one has mentioned this: but when people begin to see appreciation of purchasing power; they feel less guilty spending. *The wealth effect.*
We see this all the time with technology: every year tech becomes cheaper exponentially. Yet instead of waiting a year or two for a good discount people buy it, people would rather pay the "premium" to have that object now. 
The same applies to bitcoin, when you have some that starts to appreciate, such as your $100 becoming worth $120, you might not feel like your losing out by spending $20 since it was gained through saving and you want goods **now** in exchange for that $20 amount.

When you buy bitcoin with dollars, you have to deal with your bank. 
Coinbase is at risk of people buying bitcoin from them and then charging back the bank transaction. If transfers were instant, people would fraud coinbase all the time. 
Thus in order to have instant buys with coinbase, you have to give them your credit card as well. 
Yet you can try trucoin or expresscoin as they are trying to make it even easier to buy bitcoin.

I'm a bit confused by the demographics of windows phone. I see them as people who want the same type of closed experience fostered by apple just without apple or it's selection of apps.
It's not as developer friendly as Android and certainly less customizable. The specs of various windows phones aren't better and are similar to Android equivalents. *And while I can't say this happens to every windows phone user; when I was playing with my friends it would be smooth for some animations and then clunky and freeze up randomly whilst operating the phone on other activities.*

Interesting perspective from a dedicated miner, I appreciate you giving your side of the story without beating around the bush. Cheers, 500 bits ^&gt;  "investors" do far more damage to the price of Bitcoin than us miners.
I understand the mindset since there is so much tension, but I think there should be appreciation for both sides. Miners run the transaction network and make bitcoin useful, and investors give the currency liquidity so people can buy and sell at any time of the day.
Regular users is the point of it all, and we all need each other to keep this experiment running. It benefits us all to work together instead of scapegoating during hard times. 
 &gt; We're not the ones spamming alarmist headlines around and causing utter chaos every other week. 
Hey now, there were much less alarmist calls much earlier on. They didn't result in any changes.
A threshold was crossed: When such events occur, they trigger controversial discussions that involve so much emotion and and banter that other topics just aren't really important in the moment. 


I don't think anyone is seriously trying to manipulate the market to buy cheap coins. If we are true to what we say, then we are all early adopters currently. 


hodl? Isn't that a phrase that we are all constantly mocked for? I don't know who your pointing at but most of us have held through much worse. 
Could you even imagine the determination of people who have massive amounts and didn't take the opportunity at +$1000 because they see much farther?


I don't quite think so. Even if there was no threat, the headlines and news reports are triggers that add towards negative momentum. People are serious about decentralization. For some, the lack of this kills their love for this project and shakes their trust in it, as shown by Peter Todd. 


I sure hope you are, because that's the only way we can solve these problems. I realize that P2Pools are a hot topic because they aren't as profitable for certain miners if they switch right away. But we all benefit from trying to work out methods to make these transitions so that they benefit miners AND the community.
I sure hope we can ***hash*** this out ;)

Sure, companies and banks have tried to work together solutions for 1/7th of the world's population with bank accounts. Yet this is currently done with high fees, insurance against fraud (bitcoin does this with code not maintenance), and discretion of the coming and going governments.
Bitcoin is the first decentralized digital monetary system that combines commodity wealth storage with an instant transaction network. Everyone in the world is free to participate and no government or entity can stop, control, or manipulate the network. **That** is monumental. The idea of a blockchain is already being used by various projects (lookup twister, a decentralized twitter)
And perhaps storage is silly, although I would think a significant amount of currently  wealthy individuals would like to disagree.
@_date: 2014-04-16 03:57:09
This is absolutely incredible. The amount of effort that individuals like you put towards public projects simply for the great good astounds me. 
Your hard work is the development of the bitcoin infrastructure that will give the superior utility in the future beyond what we have even right now.

No problem, thank you for bringing up the topic. I usually stick away from those conversations on WoW boards because the conversation is always more volatile than bitcoin.
Hope this can clear the battle fog. We really need these services pitched more often. Volatility is no problem. Bitcoin makes a great transaction system if not storage of wealth.

Services that allow developers to build tools for other platforms. Chain is good example of this. 
Before the minecraft EULA rulings; I would have loved to see a minecraft world that used bitcoin as it's economy. Equally it would be cool if DOTA/LoL players could easily tip small amounts in matches. 
building these small platforms enables others to do so much more.

Thanks for doing this. Like others have stated before, the blockchain is an amazing idea; and bitcoin is just it's first implementation.
Yet it's a hard concept to understand when traditional fiat is all one has known. The example of Marco Polo before the Venice court from this thread is a golden metaphor.
Thus, it's useful to have "mainstream" understand why we are so pumped about it for more then it's price points.

Hey there! I'm glad you decided to use a USB stick to store your BTC, although you might be unfamiliar with an **easy** and **sure** method to have very good security of your coins. 
I'll break it down into steps: but essentially this loads an operating system onto your USB, so you can handle your bitcoins with more security then your regular desktop. 
1.  [Download]( a distro *(I think Ubuntu is most user-friendly combined with most support. Although [Tails]( is based around security and is a worthy mention.)*
2.  Turn your USB into a Live-OS. *(On [Windows]( On [a Mac](
3.  Plug your USB into your computer, shutdown the computer, and the boot back up into the USB
4.  *Now your on Ubuntu running off your USB stick!* Lookup the software center preinstalled to the system [and lookup Electrum]( 
5. Create a new wallet, and it will generate a [Wallet Seed]( It will be 12 random words. Copy this down onto paper! Not a computer! *(or if you use a computer be sure to encrypt the text file, but only if you know what your doing!)*
6. Copy the master public address or the first address that you see in the wallet. *This will be the address(s) that you send money to save! Your Cold Storage!*
7.  Shut down everything
8.  Send a few pennies to the address **and then start from step 3 again to recover this small amount. ***It's important to test this a few times before sending large sums of money over!!!!!!!*
Viola, now you have a small card with hard written words that securely store your bitcoins. You can make a few copies for your house and perhaps one for a bank safe deposit box. Those 12 words have enough randomness to prevent any generator from getting it, thus it's a the most user-friendly way to be sure you have really awesome security.
Cheers! 500 bits ^+@_date: 2014-08-19 15:28:27
**Volatility is a problem depending on your usecase.** I love bitcoin but I hate how people say that this isn't a problem. It is -- and it can be fixed. 
*For example:* Collecting and paying rent is impossible if there is even margin volatility because the difference comes out of my pocket. 
I want to do more things to make my life easier and I love using tech solutions of which I have the ability to scrap together my best preferences to make it easy for me. Currently I cannot do that with bitcoin because I need to know that the $100 my roommate sent me today will be $100 in a month. 
Otherwise I will use USD *(as much as I don't want to)*
@_date: 2014-05-31 14:14:34
Ahh I see. Well for small spending amounts those precautions should be fine.

Over the long-term, having a currency system that constantly devalues means the only way to save is through investments. 
Would the country need to invest in programs like social security if the value of one's wealth slowly increased over time without participation? By simply saving your consumption to be used at a later date, would we encourage better behaviors of conservation and efficiency?

Currently there is a lot of FUD *(fear, uncertainty, doubt)* because of news that Ghash, a popular cloud miner, has reached more then 51% of the network hashing power. 
Bitcoin developer Peter Todd announced his uncertainty, and there is much discussion about what to do to solve this. 
***Is this the end of bitcoin?***
Probably not. Even though Ghash holds a significant share of the network, it's in their best interest to act honorably. Yet solutions that go around them still need to be developed. And until then bitcoin really isn't "mainstream" ready. 
So with that in mind, plus the silk road coin auction, this is the news that is actively in everyone's mind.

Exactly, by separating the benefits associated with bitcoin; people can voluntarily pick the parts they want to use. 
To have this functionality would put the utility of bitcoin far beyond what it can do today. It would allow so many off-shoots and side companies that specialize specific tasks if volatility can be eliminated. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 16:09:01
Has GHash even done anything as of the past two days to comment on the situation?
The detailed a mitigation plan in case they rise in increased hash-power when the community was getting angry at them before. ***Yet not only are they not following a mitigation plan, they are actively ignoring the community***.
Seriously Ghash sucks. They put a nice wrapper on their service and making it user-friendly but behind all of it is a ruthless company without any concern for the sphere it's involved in. I hope this sort of event and their lack of response hurts their reputation.

Honestly I think this is rather silly. I'm not against alt coins and I think some of them serve very great purposes; but songcoin literally offers nothing new or unique.
Bitcoin QR codes and address can already very easily be added to [song descriptions]( It's already useful and applications to include loyalty and reward points can be created on top of bitcoin.

There has been such a small passage of time you can not realistically expect it to completely stabilize in 5 years.
During the dot come bubble, yahoo going offline would drop the stock only to pick back up again after issues were fixed.
And I would argue that it is already beggining to stabilize. Despite an incredibly negative news cycle, value only dropped about 20% and is holding strongly to that point. A point thats still significantly higher then the highest point of the previous bubble at $260. Volume and infrastructure has been increasingly heavily behind the scenes making more and more volume which makes it more difficult to swing the market with large buys and sells.
If you visited you'd see the change in market scape. From being constantly vigilant to large "whales" to now doing more technical analysis to study the crowd.

I've been trying to get Minecraft servers to use Multi-Sig and nTimeLock to enable bitcoin economies.
The idea behind this is that the server would never hold any bitcoins or be able to spend them. This gives players peace of mind. Also, transactions would be forced to use a time lock so that malicious behavior can be stopped. In-Game the transaction can appear as *"Incoming Funds"*.
These features are powerful tools to allow a small server to relatively safely implement bitcoin. It uses common sense approaches to computer security and if the plugin were available, allow a litany of script-kiddie server OPs to implement bitcoin economies.
Here is my suggestion to a [MC server](

Even as a college student I'm finding myself loading up my tipping wallets every week. Sending small change (50¢ to a $1) to organizations that matter to me make this world seem so much smaller (in a good way!).

Yes you would need a physical miner. If you cloud mine, there might be services that allow you to redirect your machines they host towards P2Pools, but you don't control the hardware would could allow for malicious agents to use this. 
If you can't setup miners your self, consider funding or creating a node. They are useful in propagating transactions faster and to ensure transactions follow the protocol. 
Or you can donate to existing p2pools :)

First off I do not believe they use 2FA; so it would be easier for a hacker to simply gleam off the password when logging into a computer.
Also all the data sits on servers somewhere; and unencrypted information is  unprotected from leering eyes.

Yet this is the most safe way to store your coins. Even printers have memory chips deep in the system memory that records all prints.
Two USBs that you can store in a safe deposit box and use with any computer securely. That's pretty convenient.
This is also handy for handling cold storage solutions like crypto cards. You can access the card wallet from this service without comprising your high quality card. Meaning you can use your card and it still remains secure.

You're absolutely correct; yet these systems have not grown to accommodate the dynamic pace of development that an open protocol brings in. 
All the systems you just described are great for regional transactions but terrible for integrating with machines, terrible for building apps on top of, inaccessible to the public to build on top of, not secure (credit cards), and cost more to transact *(especially on a global scale)*. 
Luckily bitcoin is a technology that anyone can access. That means all of it's problems can be isolated and solved individually. If you want to use bitcoin as a transaction system without volatility there are already solutions being developed for consumers. Bitreserve and Coinapult's LOCKS will not be the only ones and the solutions will only get easier. Thus you can use bitcoin purely as a transaction system without the *anus puckering volatility*.

Maybe to jumpstart your next conversation; but I always saw crypto-currencies as useful for mobilizing wealth accumulation between various games and servers.
Imagine if a variety of servers used bitcoin; then users could earn small amounts by engaging with the server. Then if that server no longer interested them or had to shut down, the user gets to maintain their work and can use it to fund their creations on the following servers.
That was the philosophy of BitMines, and it payed per block break and offered stores where users could easily sell the goods they had for coin. Whilst I played there I definitely felt more incentivized to carve out the tunnels a bit more elegantly and put more effort into my creations knowing that the time is not **completely** unrewarded. Unfortunately the admin had to shut down the server for whatever reasons; but I'd love to see other innovations come forth in the future. 
The digital realm has the most to take advantage of crypto. Without geographical borders, adding an actual economy within the game would provide some interested consequences that I would be interested to study as well.

**Imagine that you're the owner of a large Gold reserve.**
You have a very secure facility and your brand is trusted across the world for it's credibility–people trust you as a counterparty to hold their gold. *Yet what's the best way to assign ownership in a decentralized way?*
**Enter [Counterparty](
With this tool, you create scarce digital tokens (just like bitcoins!) to represent the gold in your reserve. You make 1 million coins and assign the redemption value of  1 oz per coin *(and allow it to be divisible so people can redeem fractions of 1oz).*
Now you can sell these coins through exchanges, your website, or other easy accessible places. Anyone in the world can trade these coins between each other using their mobile phones &amp; computers. You could even have merchant POS systems accept your token as payment, letting people pay with gold.
If someone wants to redeem their coin for physical gold, they can simply redeem the coin through your company–and your company knows that it's impossible to forge or counterfeit ownership of the coin.
While bitcoin itself doesn't require a counterparty to function, it doesn't prevent trusted counter-parties from utilizing this technology. People who say bitcoin should be backed by gold can use a counterparty token that acts exactly like bitcoin *(you can create cold storage, paper wallets, programmable functions, etc)* with value backed up by a trusted party.
**You can do this with anything**
*  LetsTalkBitcoin podcast has their [own community coin]( that they use to reward and fuel creative participation.
*  [Overstock]( wants to issue stock of the company in crypto-equity
*  [Storj.io]( used this as a decentralized fundraising tool and also to participate on their decentralized cloud storage network.
*  Perhaps the US government could create a USD coin, backed up by the Federal Reserve
In fact, you can create a [counter party wallet]( right now and start tinkering.

But to transfer these would be incredibly difficult and timely.


Thanks for playing semantics


Right all these are what I meant by "loans". Local banks which evaluate risk of local economies are incredibly useful. Yet because global commerce requires transactions; the big banks that have monetized on transactions are the most prevalent. 
I find this a shame because [local banks are so much more important]( *(skip to 3:30)* and efficient then large multi-national banks. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 13:42:06
**Security** 


It's become much more commonplace now for users to isolate large bitcoin holdings with cold storage. Not only have the amount of tutorials increased, but tools like [bitkey]( and [cryptocards]( are making hardcore cold storage much more consumer friendly. 
If bitcoin wealth is properly stored in cold storage and hot wallets used appropriately (nothing too large on them), you are actually quite well protected from most scams when using bitcoin. 


I have never needed to make a chargeback that wasn't because of fraud. Every time I have a complaint I simply go to the business and voice my concerns and if I paid money I get resolution. *What companies are you dealing with?*
If I don't want to trust the merchant, such as p2p transactions; I'll just use an escrow.  


Not if stored properly, which as I said is becoming easier and easier. Even Coinbase is hard to hack if the user uses 2FA &amp; their new vault feature. 


[I'd say you're incorrect.](
**Trustless Payment Resolution**


When I say trustless, what I mean is that I can have an economic transaction with someone, anywhere, without needing to trust them to honestly carry out the transaction. As a technology, bitcoin solves the problem with fraud that plagues the financial system. 


Exactly. This would **never** happen with bitcoin. When you make a purchase you do not reveal the information needed to charge your account. Bitcoin is a push system, not a pull system. 


These companies charge merchants membership fees, 2.5%+$0.30 on every transaction *(sometimes more)*, and put the weight of chargebacks on the merchant. Business owners have to account for this when selling their product and need to account these costs as part of the cost of providing the service. Thus these "bundles" that give you discounts are just making up for the premium that companies raise the price to accept plastic. 


But unlike USD, bitcoin's obstacles are purely technical. So even if starbucks doesn't accept bitcoin there is still a way [*\(and even a discount for doing it the bitcoin way\)*](
We discussed those discount bundles. They aren't free, there is a hidden cost attached to them that factor into every purchase you make.


I wouldn't. Bitcoin may be the currency of the black market but be my guest in trying to actually purchase drugs off the dark market. Do you want to risk not using TOR correctly or accidentally leaking information when buying the bitcoin? Bitcoin is a public ledger after all so if you use it for illicit purposes you are engaging in a really risky stunt to just get high. 
Is paranoia and drugs a thing? Because I think purchasing drugs off of a secret high tech drug market on a public and permanent ledger doesn't exactly sound comforting. 


Wut. You keep saying that. 
Anecdotal evidence coming: This summer my card was defrauded twice and I had to wait a week before getting a new one. *This sucks when traveling btw.* 
What did I do wrong? Simply make purchases?
Yet I have purchased honey from a redditor in Wisconsin a while back, purchased from several online bitcoin accepting shops, sold magic cards for bitcoin, etc without ever anyone once taking money from my bitcoin wallet *(knock on wood)*.

Liberty Reserve, Liberty Dollar, etc
I know it's been tried before, yet nothing has been integrated with bitcoin before. 
The reason I find this useful is that now there is an option to trade gold the same way you trade crypto. Ultimately bitcoin is more secure without the counterparty risk, but having the option to have the benefits of programmable money with the stability of precious metals is an amazing option to have. Can we stop pretending like counterparties can't work? I'm not advocating for a counterparty filled future, but when services come out that add utility: they shouldn't be criticized for "not being bitcoin".
Also currently the company isn't even letting in a lot of sign ups and if you check their reserves the value currently is very small. They are likely in a small beta run to figure out and iron out the logistics before they go all out.
I'm not putting my life savings on here until it's more trusted—yet these types of services (coinapult too) are very useful because they make bitcoin and actual network they can participate in *(not everyone has disposable income to risk on volatility)*

You're absolutely correct. There's no way to know whether or not bitcoin well work with enough or require a new method. 
It will be hard to replace the current network effect though, and current infrastructures are pushing it quickly towards the public. But hey, who knows what the future will bring.

Your probably right, it likely wouldn't immediately cause a difference. But what it would give is the opportunity for some ambitious worker.
I do not believe Amazon needs customers, or internally thinks BTC merchants are a competitive threat. *Yet theoretically if they were to accept it,* the amount of hype and free marketing would be outstanding. Without paying for any television or radio coverage, it would certainly rile up the Bitcoin crowd and big names attached to it. 
It would be very likely that they would gain *free TV, Radio, Blogging, News, and Social Media* advertising for **accepting a transaction method that let's them deposit USD cheaper.**
Again, this won't immediately happen because of emails; but it opens up possibilities to certain people.

It's a shame that GHash still has a good reputation, because the company has been completely irresponsible to everyone involved. 
**BTCGuild has a mitigation plan that they used to prevent going above 40% hashing power**. They followed through when this became a problem and showed their commitment to the community.
**GHash has a mitigation plan to prevent gaining a majority of the hashing power.** ***Yet GHash not only didn't follow through, they have remained completely silent on the issue they said they would never let happen***.
Seriously Ghash is a terrible company. They are dealing with serious business here and they aren't being involved with the community or following through with promises they made earlier.
How and why should we trust Ghash? Miners looking to move away from Ghash but don't see alternatives: pick another large pool or a P2Pool node such as PetaMine.
PetaMine has been in the top threads during this issue, research them and see if they are right for you!

Yikes your a condescending asshole. Stop being so mean in your final statements asshat.
Look I'm not trying to convince you of anything. I use bitcoin for all my online shopping and even in person shopping when there is an easy method.
I think a QR code is much easier and even more fun the typing in credit card information. Better yet I will never once lose access to my bitcoin because of a malicious actor. Waiting for new credit cards is annoying and while they are insured my own parents had their cards stolen and then didn't receive the full amounts back. 
To dismiss the security element of paying with bitcoin is absurd. 
And I'm not the only one. There are more then plenty of others who think the same way and each year the amount of transactions and purchases made with bitcoin grows.
Your just as dismissive of the faults with credit cards (high fees, setup costs, charge backs, insecure payment method, vulnerability to hacks even months after purchases, etc) as I am of the faults with bitcoin, *apparently*.
If you can't have a discussion without trying to act intellectually superior then I'm done. I like learning about the faults and benefits I'm unaware of but if your going to try and take this discussion as a platform to character attack then I'm done.
I use bitcoin everyday and love the benefits it gives me as a consumer. Your arguments are just flat out wrong based on my usage and your attempts to call me stupid for thinking this way is absurd. I've fully described the points I made before hand and now your reaching into new territory that I wasn't promoting in the first place. 
*if I wasn't on a mobile I'd continue but it's not fun putting in the effort when someone says comments like "unlike you" when I thought we were having a quality discussion*.

Bummer; I'm sorry to hear about your loss mate. I hope this doesn't get you out of the game but I would be equally devastated to have lost the same amount of funds. 
As for the dropbox option; it's still viable but you must first encrypt with TrueCrypt or another similar program. Doing this would make it useless for a hacker to have the encrypted file and would allow you to maintain the benefits of having your wallet backed up on the cloud. 
I hope your story will warn others to spruce up their security, and encourage developers to move faster to provide cheap hardware solutions. (or security on insecure machines; whatever comes first). 
@_date: 2014-08-19 15:35:35
I think it's important to balance an easy-to-use interface with functionality. I will be recommending this to my friends in the future. Although perhaps you could open up the design interface so people can design their own dashboards. ***Let artists build great UIs in a decentralized fashion. They make variety in wallet fronts and gain reputation for their work, win-win!***
Side idea: Perhaps you guys should plan for developing an "app" store for developers to show off the various use of API functions within your app. Or if not an app store, functionality with [IFTTT](
so regular people can develop neat solutions. 
'nother side note: one feature I love about mycelium is that I can make spends from a paper wallet without worrying about change-addresses or accidently saving the wallet file on my phone's persistent memory. I'm not sure if this would be possible through the browser, but it's a feature that keeps me a power user on mycelium.

Big merchant adoption will bring about price depression in the short run but leaves a stronger ecosystem for bitcoin to thrive.
**Yet unless there is a compelling reason to use bitcoin, people aren't going to jump in just because company X accepts it.**
That's why I'm really excited about services like Bitreserve &amp; Coinapult which actually serve a purpose: shield consumers from volatility. 
Until we start seeing people use services that actually improve their lives, such as unbanked sending (stable) money via email for free, we have to keep making it easier and better understood.

The media has exaggerated bitcoin's qualities before. Your probably right, although if that does happen I would be happy to grab some cheap coins while the market corrects.
There are plenty of other exchanges now and coinbase operates on bitstamp, thus it would be unlikely the GOX would do anything more then a short psychological plunge.
Honestly that would be for the best though. GOX needs to go and it will have to happen eventually.

You do realize that in Argentina the inflation rate is 25% right? So in simply a few years you lose 25%^4 of your purchasing power. 
In that regard, unless they bought at the absolute peak (which only lasted a very short time), bitcoin would be a better investment than Argentinian Pesos.
While I still say bitcoin is a high risk venture: don't risk more than you can lose -- it's way superior to the Argentinian Peso

**Alright what the fuck dude**, you were doing great until you compared an alternative economic theory similar to YEC.
*Are you kidding me?* You think Keynesian economics has nothing wrong with it? If we understood the economy correctly then we wouldn't have booms and busts, how can you possibly say that any theory that goes against Keynesian economics is incorrect?
**You didn't even bother to point out where my argument is wrong,** you simply compared it to something completely irrelevant. I could do the same to you. **What if I responded with this?**


See? This is a useless argument because you don't comment on my statement but simply dismiss it. 
When people save money, they can buy items later in time with this. This money doesn't disappear from the economy because these people will use this money when they have a need. By saying the money disappears, you would have to acknowledge it "reappears" when they spend it later down the road. 
This is a tenant of Austrian Economics. Or is Keynes the only right economist?

Oh my goodness, as if these ideas are central to the Occupy movement. "Please manage us!", "Please control everything we do so we don't mess up!"


[Yeah that's not true.](


No but they probably hate that any meager entry into the system is trapped with large fees to do anything with it. Shouldn't money be a tool for people to group together? Why have any middlemen?


Yep, this technology is most useful to those with less. 
* Such as young female writers in Arab nations [with poor gender rights]( These women don't have access to control their own finances through the traditional systems, yet with an internet connection they are free to work on the net in a way that wasn't possible before. 
*  Kenyan's don't use banks because [mobile networks]( are much better for transmitting money and traditional systems around them are too corrupt. Bitcoin enables them to access a global markets in a much more streamline process then buying US dollars from the guy on the corner of the street *(and how exactly do you get that online?)*.
*  [Anyone can sell &amp; buy anything directly from one another.]( Imagine an eBay without any fees, global, and able to see anything *(tickets to concerts, high-cost school books, selling music, amazon clones, services/skills, magic the gathering cards, whatever)* *You don't have to have money to make money in a frictionless market.*
*  How about a way for people to pool together money for projects in which everyone shares an interest? [How about in a global fashion without any fees taken out from the process?](
*  How about local community businesses that now have the ability to get the community to help them expand and reward them if/when this happens? [Or make digital tokens for events or for fun membership tokens.]( 
*  How about creating entire government structures by removing the current representation model and instead give people more ability to have input on the issues presented to the would-be-congressmen? How do you thinks banks would behave if people had the ability to respond to massive injustice?
**If you think bitcoin is only a tool of the rich then you are missing the point**. 
You can be as idealistic and critical as you want, but unless you have any better ideas *(of which fiat most certainly is not)* then stop trying to step on the toes of pragmatic ideas taking steps in that direction. 
**Or should we instead keep the same system we have now and instead just have the government forcefully transfer money from one group of people to another?** As if that will solve why that happens.

**I'm not saying you can setup bitcoin with the click of a button**
What I am saying is that you will have to pay $0 out of you bank account to set up bitcoin transactions with your company.
I understand opportunity costs which is why I made the distinction. I'm not saying its a no-effort process but you CAN do it yourself without paying anyone which is a definite plus. I understand that a 1% transaction fee isn't free *(but I wasn't talking about transactions fees, we are talking setup. And 1% is still cheaper)* 
*PS: quite being condescending, opportunity cost is basic knowledge*

Not familiar no, but how does Stripe's transactions costs compare to BitPay?
As for what I mean by pre-made HTML buttons just search "accept bitpay on SquareSpace" and there should be a few DIY guides. I didn't use these exact methods or websites but you can see what I mean (not as pretty as a product page, but gets the job done).

You can use the service completely for free with 1% per transaction or $30/month for no transaction fees.
Other than that; no application fee, a day or two of waiting for verification (opposed to weeks/month with CC vendors), no proprietary programs I needed to purchase, etc.

Ah, my apologizes. Your correct I read that wrong.

Getting bitcoin in developing countries without access to banking services is very difficult. Yet with newer bitcoin locking services, bitcoin can be used without volatility giving it greater value and utility to people living on slim margins. Hopefully bitcoin financial services built in the west can be accessed and used by individuals in developing countries [with internet connection](
**How can people without bank accounts (developing countries, poor people in developed countries) have access to online payments using bitcoin without the volatility?**
Answer: with locking services such as Coinapult and Bitreserve
While these services are new, it's now possible for anyone in the world to send USD, Euro, British Pound, Gold, Yen, Yuan via only an email address. No fees. It uses a centralized solution within a decentralized environment to add utility for new-money to be used in an old-money world. *(Currently the decentralized solutions to price locking are still being worked on, for example [NuBits]( &amp; [bitUSD](
This is for all intents and purposes: a bank for the unbanked. Now the bitcoin transaction network can be used by consumers without volatility, which gives greater value to gateway services that let bitcoin be used in the real world. 
Plus this gives rooms for startups to make it easier to spend bitcoin in the real world, now that bitcoin can be used by the masses without volatility.

The best part of bitcoin is that it allows for a **modular reconstruction of our existing financial institution.**
Instead of the bank providing all you're money services, bitcoin allows for an amalgamation of different services and programs to work together.
Thus this allows for dynamic updates, new solutions to problems, and constant development within financial applications. Essentially making the world of commerce/finance just as dynamic as we fins internet apps &amp; services.
The best part? These solutions are available to anyone with an internet connection, not just those with good bank accounts.

One of the largest differences between fiat and BTC is debt/debt holder relationship in inflationary and deflationary systems. 
When the value of money is going down constantly, people are more likely to make risky loans because simply holding onto the money makes it less valuable over time. This prioritizes risky investments over secure investments because so many options are more attractive as a storage of wealth as opposed to the currency.
In deflationary, its very risky to make loans because the time loaned out could be less profitable then simply holding the wealth. This prioritizes saving and secure investments.
The largest myth is that the latter style of economy is detrimental because it doesn't give loans to risky new ideas, causing stagnation and financial gridlock.
What this doesn't consider is that money saved is just deferred spending. When people are careful of investments and spending, they have more money on hand for when these events occur and are more cautious when building businesses and ideas. Plus time is a continuum. People who are saving today will spend later, just like people who saved yesterday will spend today. Overall it removes unnecessary risk and creates stability (that's the theory anyway).
Tl;Dr you could probably get a loan for BTC, but it's risky for both yourself and the person loaning you money. Bitcoin is still new and a huge experiment, don't buy bitcoin with money you don't have. And when you do use your own money, don't make any promises that the investment will be X by Y date. Don't risk more then you can lose. And welcome to bitcoin.

BTC Guild implemented disincentives towards joining their system and encouraged miners to switch to other pools. They didn't just hide anything above 40%
GHash/CEX said that they would implement mitigation efforts yet have not done so or explained what they plan to do. 
It's fine if a pool gets above 50%, such as a P2Pool without the ability of the operator to be incredibly malicious. Yet GHash/CEX has a great deal of equipment in-house and has already started to act irresponsibly. After previous scandals, I'm not willing to trust companies to "be good" when they clearly break promises to a decentralized community.

No changetip is an off-blockchain ledger but people can choose not to trust it because they can perform similar operations on their own.

Much less, there are tons more restrictions for taking part in the USD network. 
How is that better? This is why I'm calling you a troll. Nothing in life is perfect, thus its insane to to call bitcoin terrible because it doesn't reach some Utopian standard you have in your head without understanding the implications.

Convert your pool to p2p and try to network with other p2pools.

You don't think bitcoin was popular for tipping? The reason dodge is so useful for tipping is because its common to tip less then 5¢ (usually under a 1¢).
If dodge coin was more valuable you'd see it's tippers begin to reel in their generosity, as their currency would be useful to actually purchase goods.
I hate when dodgers insult bitcoin, completely ignoring the difference in development and community. Bitcoin has grown to a global community status with many vendors and infrastructure arising to support it. This includes assholes and saints, as it attracts more and more people and groups from around the world. Dodgecoin is a meme which is very helpful at getting new individuals comfortable with crypto.

There is volume in China yes; but their government has been shaky on bitcoin every since the bubble popped. Until they develop a more transparent, accountable, and forward thinking government; it **will** consistenly issue news that is vague and unclear. 
It's frustrating because despite there being no innovation or use as a payment network; a simple issue from a Chinese government or bank has such a powerful effect on market sentiment.
Yet when an American, Canadian, or Australian bank close accounts  for bitcoin use **when it is being used in person - person and person - business transactions**; there is usually *no effect on the price at all*.

Subsidizing a p2pool could be a great way to encourage miners to switch to p2pools and add their hashing power.
The community can use tools like [blisterpool's donation button]( to spread a donation to miners actively on the network. 
It's a great way to reward miners switching over to p2pools. They are making a leap by sacrificing short-term gains for long-term security in the network, it would be great to reward these actors by giving them regular marginal payouts even if they dont find blocks.

Your right I should have clarified. What I meant is that all these technologies are more complicated and dynamic uses of the block chain technology which show that in the next 10-20 years of development there could be an entirely new currency application that is superior technologically. 
Don't get me wrong, I freaking love bitcoin but perhaps its similar to email. What I mean is that email was the technological superior alternative of sending a message rather than using the post office.

Coinbase has gone through extensive legal effort to do the operations they currently perform. Mining is an operation outside of their current sphere and wouldn't be entirely beneficial for them to take over an industry they are unfamiliar in.

When gateway services are created; they diversify what bitcoin is able to do and can compliment current institutions.

That's a real bummer and is a real reason why instant buys are incredibly necessary for this economy to work. 
Luckily (or maybe unluckily) I have my visa attached to my coinbase account allowing me to have access to my coins immediately after using them.
The way I use bitcoin is buy small amounts occasionally over time and then use them for spending later down the road when I find discounts and getting a good value out of my coin. I didn't start spending but after researching the technology and using it for light purchases I slowly started using BTC more and more for my regular purchases. 
Perhaps you might want to wait up for Circle or use express coin or other vendors which offer faster resolution. Until then I'd suggest buying small amounts of BTC over time rather then the exact amount you need for a purchase. 
If you hold onto your bitcoin for over a few months, the past has rewarded HODLers by giving them slight discounts compared to their original purchase price.

As opposed to what? If someone sits down to order a meal and a server treats them all night; they will know the face of that person regardless of what they pay in. 
If they pay in bitcoin and don't leave a tip; you know the face of that ass.
If they pay in credit/cash and don't leave a tip; you know the face of that tool.

Woohoo! Glad to have you along, nice use name btw :)


Luckily the year is 2014 and there are COUNTLESS wallets that you can use, each with their own benefits and negatives. Regardless, all of these options are good to use as a beginner. 
*  Coinbase: This service holds your coin in their storage and let's you access your account via a username/password familiar to email and paypal. Also you can easily link your bank account with coinbase to allow yourself to buy and sell bitcoin straight to your bank account. *Once you are comfortable with bitcoin and start collecting more I'd suggest you move away from storing your bitcoin here*. 
*  GreenAddress.it/Blockchain.info/BitGo: These services allow you to store you bitcoin online (accessible anywhere with an internet connection) without storing your bitcoin with a third party. All these services claim that even if they disappear, you can access your coins. This is a great cross between convenience of a company (like coinbase) while still having access to your own coins. 
* Mycelium/Phone Local Wallets: Wallets that are storing the bitcoin on your phone (not the web) are great to store small amounts of bitcoin for the occasional purchase/tip/paying back friend. Even if your offline you can view your bitcoin balance and perform a lot of useful actions with the ease of a native app. *Be sure to use this as you would a regular wallet for paper money. You wouldn't walk around town with $1000 in your leather wallet, you keep most in the bank. With this in mind don't put too much money on your phone wallet.*
*  Electrum: Electrum allows you to store bitcoin on your computer (not on the web). The cool part about electrum is that it generates an infinite amount of public addresses that can be recovered from a single 12-word random seed. This means you can give a different address for every donation yet recover all the coins by typing in 12 random words. You can write these words on a piece of paper to avoid keyloggers. In fact Electrum can be a [relatively safe user-friendly]( way to do cold-storage. 
Whatever options you choose, be sure to do a bit of research before hand. Once you do select a wallet, try testing it with small amounts of bitcoin before sending everything in one transaction. Be sure to lookup how to do backups with whatever option you use and try going through the backup restore process before you send large amounts. 
These are simple precautions that are useful to adhere to while still learning the ropes :) Good luck and welcome to the community! We are happy to have you stop by and ask questions!

Oh hallelujah, *thank goodness for bitcoin*. 
Before bitcoin, criminals were successfully thwarted by the DEA &amp; AML/KYC laws. Before internet drug money, there was no way for criminals to build drug empires or sell wares illegally. 
*Psst... the title says "only". You can buy drugs with bitcoin and every other major currency*.

I just went ahead and sent them an email. I made sure to post the following benefits:
*  I'm a college student that uses bitcoin regularly and wish to buy my daily coffee with my smartphone.
* You can accept bitcoin and receive USD in your bank account (your company never has to handle a single bitcoin, or deal with it's volatility).
* If you accept bitcoin, you gain the benefits of ZERO Transaction Fees, ZERO Chargebacks, QUICK, EASY, &amp; FREE Setup. 
* As an added bonus, your business move will tap into the excitement of a global community of affluent Tech early adopters. has over 120k subscribers and growing. 
I think these are benefits that should be repeated. Starting first with the desire to use it ofcourse ;)
Let's keep up these bulk email campaigns. It won't cause companies to accept bitcoin off the bat. But it gives ambitious employees the statistics and feedback to start making discussions.

Like everyone here has said; you cannot compare the volume in China to other exchanges. 
In chinese culture, there is a much different approach at pricing and where businesses compete to grab market share. In the bitcoin exchange case, these exchanges do not charge fees at all for trading.
Now this means one person can make multiple trades without fees and thus make more trades. This inflates the volume. 
All chinese exchanges have transparently stated their model and said themselves to not compare volume with other fee-based exchanges.
This is nothing to be concerned about if this is your only worry, OKCoin especially has gone through great lengths to progress themselves to being the international exchange.

That's amazing! I'm actually surprised the program is still running. I tried applying much earlier on but was never verified despite a forum post. 
It was a bit silly they didn't even use a google form or something where it is easier to collect names. 
Thanks for the update!
@_date: 2014-07-30 14:30:43
It's actually very cheap to run bitcoin processing. Unlike PayPal or Visa, they don't need the resources to run their own private ledger. They don't need to verify transactions or process transaction disputes because the entire transaction is handled by the distributed network. 
Thus they simply need to pay for a few servers and salaries. With proper backing bitpay can easily float on their investments as they get bigger customers to purchase their larger plans. 
@_date: 2014-09-05 15:02:59
Are they really? What makes you say that?
If there was theft then the orders would be canceled and you wouldn't get your goods -- meaning escrow wouldn't be released. Thus isn't this a shoddy way to perform credit card theft? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 10:49:14
Yet you also got 3% back, that's more than 35¢
Most merchants are encouraged to give a 5% discount to bitcoin customers. They pass on the savings they get from accepting bitcoin and encourage more people to use it (dropping fees even more). 
These incentives usually cover the discrepancies. Plus these different exchange rates are already becoming less and less as traders become more developed and arbitrage opportunity pops up

Thanks Nom! I just recognize that this problem can only be solved with consensus of the network, and that won't happen if we isolate the very people who paid outrageous sums to run the transaction network of bitcoin.

I'm not saying investing is pointless but I'm saying that it's important to keep the context clear. 
This is an amazingly radical new approach to the existing systems and there isn't a whole lot of historical precedence. How the whole story will play out is something I don't want to pretend I actually know. 
People who see the technology as what it is will want to own a piece of it, but I dislike hailing bitcoin as an investment when there are much better vehicles if that's the goal. 
No hate on investors, I'm an investor myself.

I love when it was teasing the eccentricities of bitcoiners and helped improve debate; but recently it's turned into much more mean spirited comments aiming to say ANYTHING to make the OP look ridiculous.
It's crossing the line when you attack people for being bitcoin enthusiastic in a sub dedicated exactly to that. 
For example, is just the icing on the cake, trying to stereotype a crowd of many different interests, backgrounds, and perspectives into an annoying and misprioritized "bitcoin consumer". Like really dude? What's with the negative vibes, this is a chill and rather insignificant thread to make that sort of attack.

Other Alt-coins that use POS algorithms usually begin with POW and then transition towards POS. 
Coming across articles like this absolutely fascinate me, it's crazy to think how early in the game Bitcoin is. The bitcoin of tomorrow could be a wholly different beast on the inside then what it is today.

I would even argue that this increasing trend of hostility ironically displays Dodge's same growing pains that bitcoin experienced earlier.

I'd recommend using Electrum. It's supported on various open source sites like bkchan.org and also allows you to create an unlimited amount of addresses from one backup. 
The benefit of using electrum is that you can program the Master Public Key with a mining service to make sure each payout is to a different address. Yet when you want to spend, or sweep your savings you can easily type in the 12 random word seed to collect all the payments. This is used in retail POS applications to ensure each paying customer uses a different address. 
Definitely is less of a headache then worrying about change addresses through a paper wallet.

You do realize how costly it is to try and transfer money without a bank right? American unbanked commonly take huge fees at check cashing, western union, and paying for money orders. Plus little of this is accessible easily from a smartphone which means lots of travel time.

This is an interesting experiment at trying to nationalize a Crypto-currency. I'm assuming this particular coin will not fair well because of Iceland's notorious capital controls to protect the dying ISK, yet its enough to get the conversation going.
Yet crypto currency can be a boon to nations with poor monetary policy. This cuts costs on printing as well as establish a transparent and error free accounting system which can be traded seamlessly on a global platform.  It would be relatively easy for a government to encourage markets within their borders to accept the currency. 
This gives democratic leaders that wish to root out corruption and implement trust-less systems a chance at really implementing progress. 
I'm excited to see the countries that follow suit. Perhaps some of the African countries with poor monetary policies yet rising technologic infrastructures.

It would be awesome to see African nations begin to adopt Bitcoin. Not only would it encourage saving (due to the nature of a deflationary currency) but also would give access to a global market.
Yet a large problem for these nations would be entering the market. Because bitcoins gain value over time, it makes it less incentivizing to trade them for an increasingly inflated currency without much global pull. Yet at the same time, access to computers is more prevalent in Africa then banking institutions. I think this could be used to accumulate digital wealth.
Personally I have had success offering my graphic design skills and have managed to earn decent side change with my skills. It would be trivial with a basic grasp of the English language for individuals from anywhere to offer services that can be provided over the web. Whether it be coding, translation services, graphic design, website creation, etc: all these are avenues for individuals from anywhere to develop skills and contribute towards the growing information economy. 
Should these African nations begin to take bitcoin seriously, they could really draw in entrepreneurs towards the capitals of innovation by starting bitcoin friendly services and exchanges. Yet this must be met with encouragement from the government.
So there is work to be done but it is already possible. Find jobs that can be preformed from anywhere to anywhere and make sure to be active in your local politics to show its potential. Nations in which currency is less valuable have the largest incentive to adopt bitcoin. Due to US having a stronghold on the word reserve currency (because of our occupation of oil providing nations), we will likely be last and thus this gives the opportunity to other nations.

Can someone create a video going over what this guy said and pointing out all the flaws?
**This guy blatantly says that GHash/Cex.io is an unknown entity**
* [CIO of GHash/Cex.io interviewed by BitcoinMagazine](
* [Oh look, Cex.io has their physical office location on their "contact us" page.](
I'm not trying to say GHash isn't a flawed company and I have rallied against them in the past: yet to say it's user-experience isn't as trustworthy as paypal is ludicrous. 
GHash/Cex was so popular because it was so consumer friendly and was the best option. They were literally just too popular/good. 
PayPal on the otherhand is rife with user-experience frustrations: [paypalsucks]( etc
**This guy blantantly misunderstands the importance of mining difficulty**.
He mentions that the entirety of the bitcoin network could be run on one server. 
Yes. This is true that the actual transaction data on the bitcoin network is minuscule and can be run on a single server. 
*Yet would this single server be able to prevent a world of hackers, botnets, governments, and rougue actors?*
* Who would run this single server?
* Who would maintain this single server in case it breaks down
* Who would protect this single server from outside attacks?
* What is the incentive for an organization to run this server without a profit motive?
* If they run into political problems, how do they prevent political pressure?
**The value of the bitcoin mining network is to secure a world transaction network.**
Especially with applications like counterparty, colored coins, open bazaar, etc -- the need to secure the bitcoin network is why it costs so much energy to do so. 
**Yet this is an unfair comparison**
How much energy and waste do physical bank offices waste? How about the huge warehouses of PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, Google Wallet, servers? Does this person think that there isn't  the same waste of energy already?
**What a bummer, I was hoping this guy would actually make some good points, but instead he focused on comparing services to ghostbuster monsters and allusions to communism (hammer and sickle).**

Now I know that sounds very "bitcoin-circle-jerky" but these laws actually don't do very much at all to stop organized crime or terrorist operations. Yet in consequence these laws shut down services and businesses that aim to make money more usable and flexible within the modern age. 
**Let's look at some recent history of this example**
Let's look at the Liberty Reserve. Incorporated in 2006, the Liberty Reserve let anyone in the world sign up with an email address and then send USD, EUR, or Gold to any other account with marginal fees. This made the service very popular amongst travelers, FOREX traders, and simply people trying to send money from one place on the globe to another. 
Yet their system was unique in that there were no chargebacks and that signing up was available to anyone with an email address -- no bank account needed. Naturally, this sort of system was so useful that some criminals decide to launder money through these networks. 
[In 2013, the US government shut down the company, seized all the assets, and arrested the CEO &amp; several employees on account of letting $6b go laundered through their network.]( 


Correct, no longer can criminals use the Liberty Reserve to transfer funds.
Yet did this stop illicit operations being performed by criminals? *Not even close.*
**Not even one month later**


What was the penalty for this massive laundering scheme that benefitted south american drug, sex, and gun smuggling? 


So basically they pay a marginal fee of the profits and then nothing else because "it's already bad PR". 
*If the government was actually concerned about money laundering I would expect the consequences of a larger operation to be more dramatic. Yet somehow a fine and bad PR don't quite measure up to shutting down the business, seizing assets, and being arrested.* 
*[As a fun side note, another year later and HSBC is in the news again for more wrong-doing. It doesn't really seem like they "learned a lesson".](


[Fine, the Liberty Dollar has a very similar story.](
**This is why I think AML/KYC Laws are boogus**
These laws are nothing more than large protective walls around banks without actually stopping laundering from occurring on a massive scale. So the laws do not stop organized crime, the laws entrench traditional institutions which are very well connected with government, and criminalizes entrepreneurs and individuals trying to make money more useful to everyone.

Bitcoin actually has a host of developers that are working very hard to develop new features that don't require hard updates to the code (as in doesn't require everyone to update for it to work). This is very difficult and updates are done VERY VERY marginally as to not cause disruption or need everyone to update constantly. 
Yet again, one doesn't need to update bitcoin directly to develop new solutions for bitcoin. Individuals can build solutions on top of the code to make bitcoin more convenient and run a profitable business or a successful side protocol because bitcoin is programmable money. Even if there isn't a feature built (such as escrow), individuals can use the programming nature of bitcoin to build various services to enable this.
Again though, like you said anyone can take the bitcoin code and create their own coin. That's exactly what Litecoin, Dodgecoin, PPCoin, etc are. They take the bitcoin source code and then modify it with features to make their own currency (yet that doesn't mean they hold the same value to USD ratio). 
If something better comes along.. well then people would migrate towards the better solution. There would be individuals who would believe in the new technology and trade their bitcoins for the new technology. I still believe people would want to take advantage of this and/or hold their own assets because of bitcoin's longer history and market penetration. Yet switching from Bitcoin to another crypto-currency would be much more liquid then from USD to said new currency. In fact, bitcoin users would likely have first dibs as they already have a currency that can be sent across the world instantly whilst USD holders would have to wait for a service to accept USD for xCoin. This can be seen on the various bitcoin -&gt; alt coin markets already available. 
Bitcoin has been around for only 6-7 years or so. We really don't know what will happen in the future but so far there has been incredible support for an open, decentralized, and global currency. And because the network effects of money are so incredibly effective; it would be difficult for another currency to gain considerable marketshare without having some pretty significant features.

@_date: 2014-06-17 15:03:06
Everything you said is 100% true regarding independent miners joining pools.
Yet 25% (probably more since this was a quote by GHash) of the pool is "cloud mining" which is essentially GHash/CEX having people invest in their own mining operation: aka miners don't own the equipment and can't as easily switch pools. 
That's why its important to make these sort of things known so people who are looking at cloud mining can be cautious of who to support.

For my own preferences I love the mBTC unit.
I think 92.2 mBTC to represent that amount is the easiest to register in my head (although I'm sure some as I am countries would have the opposite familiarity with larger numbers).
I think its easy enough to say "hey you owe me 10 mils" and in the context I'm using it, I don't think it would be confused for million :P
I know eventually that means well have to move to miks (micros) but I would assume by the time bitcoin got to those prices we wouldn't be worrying about which name attracts the most mainstream attention.
I'm sure overall someone will something they like, whether its zibs or bits, and the most popular meme will last.
Until then, I'm using mBTC because it presents the clearest picture in my head. I don't feel comfortable using larger units and I'm not worried about personally using uBTC later

Dude you have brought up some amazing points so far and it's great to have this type of press for transparency and accountability. It's important that as a community we strive to encourage these features to ensure that scams and bad actors are kept out.
Yet at the same time, these are real people that operate in the real world. Most bitcoin startups and organizations are small groups of people trying to conquer big tasks with the help of this empowering technology. *It's great to push these small groups to constantly improve and update their methods*–**but for christ's sakes these are real people in incredibly stressful and obstacle-filled journey.**
Sean's Outpost isn't an unknown entity in some unknown land, they are a real organization with clear owners and impact in the surrounding area. As I said before, it's great to have accountability and transparency **but can we please stop demonizing Sean's Outpost for not being absolutely perfect?**.


Honestly, you statements are incredibly direct and derogatory. It looks like Jason has a ton on his hands and is fighting a ton of battles and challenges. That's stressful and time consuming as is. It's not like open-accounting isn't important, but it doesn't affect the daily operations. The points you bring up are important yet lack any sort of respect for what they are doing. I'm not saying don't be critical, **but I'm saying have a heart just in case you might be over-zealous. Realize there is another side of the story.**

TransferWise looks great; I'm glad the guys from skype are building money applications in the same vein. Yet I think it's easy to forget that building decentralized alternatives will always be more challenging but way more rewarding in the long run. 
If bitcoin or some other open protocol is used to transfer money and becomes popular in an area; it would propel ambitious coders in the area if they have access to develop their own niche applications based on this use. 
Plus this way you can build a solution that can work across the globe.

Well bitcoin is supposed to encourage saving. It makes the individual think whether they really wish to spend their deflationary currency to have purchasing power now.
But besides that, I find bitcoin useful for online purchases. After the PayPal and Target scandals, its clear that companies cannot be trusted with credit cards (no company should, credit cards is an incredibly insecure and inefficient tool).
Thus I use my bitcoin reserves to buy items through snapcard (let's me buy anything from anywhere in bitcoin) and then repurchase that amount through coinbase. This way I never reveal my credit card information on these websites and thus will never have to worry of having my cc number stolen.

I'm sorry you have had a negative experience; please understand why the community might be reacting in such a way.
While I always try to help users if I see problems I understand; Bitcoin has been around much longer and has gone through much larger infrastructural changes as more and more merchants have started to incorporate it into their systems.
There are dedicated subreddits such as which is meant for these types of questions. Thus users who are seeking the most recent news of which technologies or companies are using bitcoin today may not have the time to answer the large amount of these questions.
Yet if you look farther back when Bitcoin was still gaining recognition then you'll see the same exact type of helpfullness. But bitcoin has matured and is at a much larger stage then Dodgecoin is.

I'm sorry that you have had a bad experience. And your right, the technology can definitely be made more user friendly (although I'm pretty comfortable with it). Yet the problems you were having seem to be misunderstanding.


The merchant has a misunderstanding and should have it setup for zero confirmations for instant payments; and 1-2 confirmations if you have time. The bitcoin transaction appears on the network instantly, and only with a group of computers that are 51% stronger then the global network could they double spend the transaction (fake the spend). 


It's a bummer that these initial businesses crashed so early on, but I think the community is definitely maturing. Just look at coinbase and bitpay; of which have spent the investment needed to abide by all US regulations to ensure their legitimacy. Learning from the mistakes of previous startups, recent ones learned from them and took the precautions needed to install a stable infrastructure for bitcoin in the US.  


I think you fail to realize that this isn't necessarily a "good" thing. Yet the community has LONG warned about the illiquidity and problems of GOX. This is the exact reason why their prices were higher then the other exchanges, because you can't get USD out thus you have to buy BTC to withdrawal (thus the BTC price is inflated). 
This has been a ticking time bomb, and despite our best attempts; people still trade on GOX. 
So again, it's not a good thing, and it has definitely spread some short to middle term Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt: yet this creates a buzz. People hear about bitcoin again and begin to look into what's going on. After this event, people are not likely to trade on GOX and other exchanges have upgraded systems to prevent similar problems. When the price is low, either the lack of activity causes a sell off of individuals who need money now: or if bitcoiners don't sell (hold) then the demand will raise the price. 
Yet significant behind the scenes investments behind the scenes, and talks of coming SecondMarkets to unleash bitcoin to the hedge markets (correct me if I misunderstand this). As well as more startups coming out with creative new ideas and machines (such as the various ATMs, merchant adoption, regulated exchanges, etc) during 2014.
This is the perspective that I'm coming from. I sympathize for your pains during the growth of this protocol, yet as the community learns how to simplify the processes, the danger of error will be continually reduce. In the near future this might be in the form of centralized banks that are well established with local governments, and have guarantee policies. In the distant we might see some cool protocol and software new possibilities.

*You should not be downvoted; your merely asking questions about topics that have been heavily discussed recently. Please feel free to openly ask questions!*
Yep! Once P2Pools regularly wins blocks they will not need donations to make them competitive. On their own, P2Pools are beneficial for individual miners, yet no one wants to be the first to leave a large *(regularly paying)* pool.
While this is quickly changing, P2Pools don't win blocks often enough for most miners to want to switch to it. Donations are meant to bridge this gap, making it profitable short-term while people join in. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:55:24
Essentially bitcoin has created a strong interest in decentralized technologies.
These technologies are fundamentally anti-fragile as once they exist and gain users, its impossible to shut down because no one runs he technologies.
Thus in this sense the dark wallet is simply code that let's you take advantage of bitcoin privacy features. The code is completely visible for anyone to view what's in it and the code itself can be copied and edited to make different wallets.
That is why people trust open source and decentralized technologies because everyone can look and verify the code as well as improve on it. Also since no one controls any servers, there is no potential for information to be seized/edited from a central server.

It's actually a pretty neat system that let's the community help drive people towards P2Pools, by subsidizing their cost. 
Imagine your a Ghash miner looking to help the community. You unfortunately have bills to pay and need to make certain cut-offs in order to keep your machine running. 
If you joined a minuscule pool that never won blocks; you'd be wasting a lot of energy, opportunity cost, and money mining on this pool if your waiting indefinitely while the difficulty goes up.
Now this wouldn't be a problem if enough people joined P2Pools, as they would be big enough to semi-regularly win blocks. 
*Yet this is the chicken/egg problem. Which comes first? The miners willing to switch and raise the hashing power, or the hashing power to encourage miners to mine in that pool?*
Thus there is a bit of a steep curve that miners need to overcome to make a pool worthwhile. 
**This is where the community can help**
BlisterPool has a [donation tool]( which lets you send bitcoin to be evenly distributed to miners within the P2Pool based on their hasing power. 
Essentially with community members donating to P2Pools, miners in these pools would be receiving payouts even if the pool hasn't found any blocks. This encourages miners to stick around, and with their hashing power added to the pool there is a slightly higher chance of getting a block. 
Do this enough times with enough promotion and it could snowball into the P2Pool having enough hashing power to be self-sustaining. No donations would be needed as the P2Pool would have enough hashing power to win blocks at a competitive rate compared to other pools.
Thanks for asking! 50 bits ^***tl;dr? Donating would be a pressure release valve, helping the community encourage miners to give up short-term profit to benefit network security through decentralization until it reaches a sustainable amount.***

In terms of the community becoming more skeptical of people asking them for money: this is a great trend. It's good when the community can demand better standards, as we've seen with exchanges implementing audits to their services and a focus on user-control of coin. 
Yet Jason King and the crew at Sean's Outpost have been nothing but incredible members of the crypto community thus far. They have used cryptocurrency to make the most efficient homeless outreach service in their area and changed the conversation of crypto being used solely for illicit goods. The crew at Sean's Outpost uses all of the donations received and even pitches in personal funds to keep the place running and providing meals and shelter. 
Is there room for improvement? *Of course, there is room for improvement in every project.* Yet let's not start a witchhunt without giving a chance for the team to respond. Not every project is run as a professional corporate business with everything perfectly lined up, bitcoin is full of startups and groups that are doing amazing things yet still working out the kinks in their systems.

Since not everyone has access to a computer they can use only for bitcoin, liveCDs with electrum or some other deterministic wallet works wonders. 
Using a LiveCD you can manage your bitcoin on the same computer yet in an environment that deletes all activity when you log off.

Still free transactions, just showing scalability. But you're right, thanks for the chuckle
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:19:42
I disagree, it is incredibly more safe to use bitcoins then creditcards.
Look at the recent target scandal. All businesses store their customer's credit card information on databases; of which this process is not heavily regulated to the point where a user knows exactly how it's done.
Thus everyone who uses their credit card at risky establishments have the possibility of their information being stolen for the duration of the data storage (which could be forever). 
Bitcoin **completely** removes this problem because users send money out instead of writing in sensitive information that they hope is only used honestly and protected securely. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:29:09
Gah, my bad for misunderstanding and taking you out of context in that case; I have no qualms with a bank that used bitcoin to decrease fees, create solutions (maybe pulling some talent towards finance away from wallstreet), and provide peace of mind. 
Hell they could just use internally to decrease fees an I would be happy.
@_date: 2014-12-14 13:24:51
Interesting, well if that's the case then this service could be replaced by a more convenient one *(I heard AMX is trying to make a card)*. I'm just trying to point out that you can get paid in Bitcoin (through bitwage), store your value as USD, and then spend your btc through gateways.
What documents does xapo need? I'm curious because there are many factors that keep low income workers from getting bank accounts so I'm surprised Xapo is more difficult to work with.

Don't listen to the troll, but using nodes are beneficial to the network. 
By running a node using software provided by the core devs, you ensure transactions on the network that use this protocol propagate faster and attempts to be malicious are caught quickly.

I fully suggest you try delving into wordpress then, it's definitely a time sink; yet you make noticeable progress in no time. 
I started with no HTML knowledge at all, so I took a few codeacademy courses, then found some [useful videos on youtube]( to use this basic HTML knowledge with an easy to use responsive framework. 
Then I found the [wordpress theme reverie]( and used this [youtube video]( to figure out how to begin tinkering. I'm actually just using wordpress to setup the navigation and pages while I design the site using foundation. It's pretty awesome once you start diving into it :)
*(ps, sorry about the german video, I couldn't find any other reverie tutorials that were so specific to what I was doing. I can understand enough german to where it wasn't an issue, and I'm sure you could easily follow along what he does on the computer anyways.)*

For me it's a security thing.
After using bitcoin I refuse to buy things with my credit card. It's ridiculous that I need to hand out my sensitive credit card information to be saved forever on a server somewhere. 
The target scandal shows how ridiculous it is to use credit cards in the modern era. Bitcoin solves this problem for consumers completely. 
I get the same security as PayPal without having to use their service or pay a third party fees as insurance against fraud across their network.

What? 
Money was charged to their account; it was withdrawn from their account. Then they went to the credit card company. They only received a portion back.
I know your a troll account so I won't give you too much of my time, but they did indeed lose money out of their bank account that the credit card company did not redeem the entire bill. They blamed my parents for being irresponsible (I don't understand how paying for food with a credit card at a restaurant is irresponsible but I digress).

P2Pools are a snowball. They begin small and soft, but eventually become unstoppable. 
One way we can all help is to make P2Pools reward their miners *(even when there are no blocks found)*. In fact, most of the miners switching over are used to regular small payouts, yet with P2Pools they have to wait a few days to see progress. *That's discouraging*
[BlisterPool has a donation button]( that rewards the miners actively participating in the P2Pool. It would be great to reward the miners who took the plunge to sacrifice short-term profits to help grow the P2Pool network.

Ah bummer; I thought because it was one-way (only cash -&gt; bitcoin) that it required less regulations as individuals can't receive USD from the machines.

@_date: 2014-03-10 12:27:39
Like others have said, I believe you are incorrect on this. The sender pays the bitcoin fee, and bitpay provides [free conversion]( for charities. Even for-profit the fee is either 1% or a 30$/mo [flat rate.](
While some others may give you some better analysis, you could also look over to to gain insight of day traders within the bitcoin ecosystem. 
A lot of their tactics and trading analysis are skills from the FOREX market. 
Just giving you an extra link for your research. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:12:44
No one is really giving you the clear answer you're searching for. 
**Basically no**. The price of the bitcoin would need to rise tremendously within the single day you bought and then spent your coin in order for it to trigger taxation. Otherwise the rise and falls are so slim that they don't reach the minimum gains needed to pay taxes on. 
Then again if the price does shoot up astronomically then you'd have to pay taxes, yes. Although if that's the case paying a small cut to the government will be the least of your worries. 
If the price plummets astronomically then you get to have a tax write off. 
**Yet most likely nothing will happen within the few days you hold your bitcoin. Thus no tax**
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:31:17
Not a problem! Glad I could be of some help so that someone like yourself can do your part to secure the network. 
Yet still be wary and be sure to research around. When using cloud mining, it's very difficult to ensure that you actually have control of your devices: so definitely try to pick  the pools with the most transparency and direct user involvement with their purchases.
Again, thanks for investing money to support the network other then GHash, we need to support P2Pools any way we can to bleed away support from GHash/CEX *(Although I still advise looking to transform that into actual machines you control if you plan to invest seriously!)*

Let's see here
*  The blockchain is open globally for anyone to use, regardless of social hierarchy 
*  This technology offers the biggest benefits to those in society with less developed or penetrative financial infrastructure (aka developing countries)
*  The network effect binds everyone using the protocol to work together and build the infrastructure. If you have been to any BTC conferences you'll notice that strange developers are having genuine full fledged conversations with straight-lace business folk.
*  No one manages the bitcoin network, it's based upon the common agreement of the users to use it in the way it's designed. 
*  All the information about the system is transparent and visible for public scrutiny. 
I'm not saying bitcoin is communist, but to flag this technology under any banner is hilariously silly. New paradigms don't fit into previous molds bra'

hey dude calm down
Literally not a single one of us can predict how human behavior and public reception affects the use of crypto currency. BTC is deflationary, LTC is copy x4, and doge is inflationary. 
Thus it's just another experiment to give us more information how humans behave with crypto and economies, that at the very least attracted and educated many individuals into crypto then who wouldn't have before.
*PS: I hold probably like $1 worth of doge from tips, I'm not invested or care much about it, but I think the rants against it are pathetic and unnecessarily whiny as if doge is really going to bring down LTC or BTC.*

Yeah it unfortunately sounds more complicated than it is. I simply use a liveCD with Ubuntu on it (you can order them cheap/free in the mail) and then download electrum off the Ubuntu app store. You get to use the same computer you use and only requires an Ethernet cord to plug into the internet. 
Store that 12 word seed on a piece of paper (not computer!), record a few addresses down (I make .5 mBTC payment to them to track) and your good to go. 
Boot off the computer and when you restart nothing will be saved onto your harddrive. 
Yet then again, crypto cards are awesome! I still like my own contraption for storage though

I understand, and even agree with you. But I would like to point out that GHash has already been breaking promises made to the community. 
Remember Mark? Of MTGox? He was a trusted and loved member by the community. The guy even bought the rights to the name bitcoin to prevent patent trolls from messing with the community!
Yet it turned out that he made too many promises about his commitments to the community, and even acted dishonestly behind the scenes. 


GHash/CEX has stated in the past that they would use mitigation efforts to prevent reaching different thresholds of hashing power ratio. 
They never stated what these thresholds were, and then when 51% was reached there was no effort from GHash/CEX to mitigate. 
In comparison, BTCGuild increased fees and even shut off membership to drop their hashing ratio back to 40% when it started rising. GHash/CEX have be silent and failed to put in such measures. 
On top of this, there has been no engagement with the community. The uproar is because there is no contact from GHash/CEX even though there is high tension against their company. Silence is not transparent, and they are not honest because they have already broken promises. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:07:38
Yeah I would understand that as much. I think part of the protocol though is that it instantly sweeps the coins, as the transferred wallet is only to be used for the transaction. 
And then even on the merchant side, they would have a new wallet for each sweep. And then these are used in conjunction to make other payments.
I thought this process would reduce taint by constantly splitting coins into various independent wallets with many transaction layers around them.
**But I did not realize that sweeping involves broadcasting a transaction** 
Bummer, I would still like to know where I read this though. Because I have searched without success but I remember reading that the current way we use bitcoin was not the original intention. 
**Thanks for your response!**
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:07:58
[This is perfect.]( 
*Another way to look at it*
**An exchange is essentially just a pool of available offers. Some people want to buy bitcoin, other people want to sell bitcoin.**
There a TONS of trades available and thus all these offers compete with each other to get "filled". In fact, individuals even trade in between exchanges to take advantage of price discrepancies between them. *This is called "arbitrage".*
If there are more people selling than buying, than people who are selling need to compete with one another to get their offer filled, so they try marginally undercutting each other on price in order to get their offer taken quicker around the price they want. 
When people are buying, the opposite happens. More people want bitcoin than is available so they offer bids for slightly more USD. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:41:34
I think this is a valuable point. While bitcoin is still volatile and cannot be expected to move in the direction you want... 
The fact that it moves up and down so much day by day with increasingly more stable parameters let's you essentially have discounts on everything you buy.
(again do this in moderation and don't buy more then you can lose)
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:17:23
Seriously, all miners need to switch to alternatives such as P2Pools.
They are more beneficial for miners (no fees) and its safer for bitcoin users. 
If your a miner using Ghash, please switch to a p2pool before you continually bring up this stress. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 05:24:57
@_date: 2014-07-28 13:59:05
How were the number of big holders determined?
Regardless this is rather silly because even if they unloaded their coins, it would tank the price but then even out the distribution which would be taken into consideration in the months following up. As long as the protocol doesn't break it can always recover. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 22:03:11
*I think paper is actually pretty unsafe. Printers have been known to make copies of what they print in the past; I'm to paranoid to ignore that.*
**The best is encryption! Here is how:**
1. Download Tails/clean LiveOS (like ubuntu)
2. Make a Live CD/USB and then boot up your computer on this OS
3. Download Electrum, generate a new seed
4. Copy seed (12 random words) on paper (not electronically), copy master public key however (picture of QR code perhaps).
5. Delete everything. Shut 'er all down.
6. Store copies of paper with seed in safe places. 
There you go! With a **CD, piece of paper and penci**l you can create a strongly secured wallet.
*If you want to do this without paper you could also try typing the seed on a text editor within the live os, and then encrypting this file with another password that's easier to remember so you can safely store this seed on your cloud storage.*

Your correct; economies of scale have traditionally encouraged larger corporations and organizations to handle operations. It's much more profitable and easy to setup a centralized organization and hierarchically make decisions. 
That's why by default humans tend to form centralized systems.
Yet these systems are fragile, and are easily breakable (or if not are very expensive to maintain resilience). And when the dominos finally crumble, it's common for smaller and less "user-friendly" decentralized solutions to come about.
Yet the benefit of these decentralized solutions is that, while not immediately better then centralized services, are anti-fragile and scale much more efficiently.
**For example,** napster was the go-to place to get free music. When they were shut down, p2p torrents became the popular (and still popular) way to transfer much more then just music. 
**For example,** normal profit-motive incentives should mean that projects like Wikipedia should not exist. Yet it is by far the most popular source of information for people around the world. This points to an error in our understanding in human behavior and markets.
For these reasons, I think bitcoin is an incredibly valuable experiment to study the social-economic relationship that decentralized money has with it's participants. It's truly in the hands of people participating and dragging in people around it through the network effect, and the community has come together in the past to solve much more staggering problems. 
*Let's see what happens!*

It's literally impossible to bruteforce a bitcoin wallet. This is proven by the fact that it's code is completely open source and available for anyone to try and break it (anyone can view what makes it tick) and anyone can "fork" the code to make their own "bitcoin" (called alt-coins which don't have nearly as much value because they don't provide additional innovation). 
So far, the mathematics of cryptography have prevented a possible hack, and the current bitcoin network is the single largest super computer-network in the world. It would be impossible for an individual with even the most state of the art computer to be able to break open a bitcoin wallet.
As I said before, everything is open source and transparent. Every transaction is viewable for [EVERYONE]( which makes counterfeiting impossible. Yet despite it being completely transparent, individuals can make a new wallet for every transaction and it's incredibly difficult to single out an individual holding possession of an account. 
As for offline, you can already create a bitcoin wallet offline and send money to it. This is called paper wallets and are 100% hack proof considering they have never once touch the internet. Thus individuals in time of disaster can use paper wallets the same way we use dollar bills. Except that individuals could very easily extract the private keys from these bills to collect the coin onto their individual wallets.
Also, on android phones you can engage in transactions with bluetooth and coming up soon: NFC. 
The best part about bitcoin is that because it's so open, everyone is free to create solutions for any inconvenience it might have. The same way there were inconveniences with email and internet before yahoo, google, and other web giants took the initiative.

Thank you so much for the tip I agree with your desire to let common use decide the nomenclature while we simply layout a flexible terminology chart to avoid confusion.

It opens up advertising to more people and allows them to take advantage of monetizing their videos if they please.
By simplifying the payout process, it makes it easy for more individuals to run videos that generate passive income as opposed to depending on possible tippers (and no one said you cannot do both!)
The possibilities that tech companies can do with bitcoin is amazing. It gives developers so much more opportunity then with traditional systems.

Dude what are you talking about? Sean's Outpost is a small organization that packs up sandwiches and then goes under tunnels and into parks to deliver them. They aren't a huge company with tons of assets and they probably aren't trying to be bought by someone else down the line. 
You can have good books without them being transparent. What are you talking about "straight &amp; transparent"? Do you own a business yourself? Do you know the implications and effort it takes to maintain that? Again remember the context that this is a small group doing with loads of daily operations.

not necessarily, they simply do transaction processing; exchanging BTC for USD. Thus as long as the protocol works, they can run their business regardless of the price.  
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:41:58
&amp;gt; Thats all good, but there is a considerable difference between a pool (In this case GHash.IO) being at or above 50% and a single entity (for example Cex.io) having 50% of the hashing power
That is very misleading. **For starters; CEX.io IS GHash.io so a closer description would be a single large entity controlling the largest pool.**
&amp;gt; Machines lying in wait? 
GHash/CEX is the single largest mining operation and has a successful, scalable crowd-investment style operation. Like any normal company, they plan to grow and likely buy machines in advance to do so. 
If their pool was to suddenly push up above 51% considerably then there would have been significantly more outrage. Just because GHash/CEX has been mostly silent doesn't mean they aren't listening or paying attention. Do you honestly think this company just barely reaching 51% is a sign of their peak capacity? Or would it make sense that the company is inching the line to gauge a reaction (to see what is absolute maximum they can go without being called out). 
This latter approach isn't necessarily malicious, but it's risky and short-term. It doesn't matter if Google was the largest pool owner; bitcoin cannot succeed when there is a weak link. And constant breaching of 51% essentially means GHash/CEX becomes the equivalent of a PayPal transaction server center prone to government regulations and potential security threats. 
**It's good the community is not tolerating even a slight breach over 51%**
We are setting precedents that reward good players in the bitcoin community and we are calling out the companies that say they're good without the actions or transparency to prove it.

Brawker and other websites aim to do exactly what you are talking about.
They give bitcoiners a 5-10% discount when buying online items with bitcoin. The desired purchase is sent through the website and someone buys the item with their credit card and then they get the bitcoin.
It's really an ingenious incentive program

It definitely wouldn't be to make a profit but it would be nice to see a small build up of satoshis over time from running a node.

Bitcoin is an amazing technology that has the capability to become great. But it's not a get-rich-quick scheme and those who think like that **will** be burned. 
Bitcoin is valuable because of the opportunity it gives us to develop complete alternatives that are **atleast** just as good transaction and monetary systems compared to the establishment.

Your statement is incorrect: My parent's only received a small fraction of the funds they lost through their credit card. Despite all the money they pay for the insurance against this and the money they paid dealing with this; they did NOT get back all the money they lost. So currently if you pay with credit cards, there is nothing an individual can do to protect themselves from a bad actor. That freaking sucks. 
Considering were talking about losing money through transactions; this is were bitcoin reigns supreme. It's **impossible** for a hacker to take payment and then use that transaction information against you.
I agree there needs to be better security for bitcoin wallets and it needs to become mainstream; but your not appreciating what currently exists. I will always support that. And the benefit of bitcoin is that anyone can develop solutions for it; the same cannot happen for regular finance without authority from the big banks. This is why we still use credit cards from the 50s. 
Some simple security tips: 
2FA with Google Authenticator/Authy provides some damn good security that is hard (if not impossible) to breach. By enabling that on your wallets it would hinder most security issues with not much more needed.
Also it's common practice to not put all your eggs in one basket. By splitting up the bitcoin wallets, your wealth is incredibly more protected. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 00:34:05
Whatever, I've been using my bitcoin and bank in conjunction to give me the best possible benefits for myself.
Because i use these solutions everyday bitcoin being useful isn't an abstract political statement.
I really don't care what you do personally, I just think your opinion that bitcoin is some underground technology without modern use is completely ignoring so many solutions already available.
Banks can use bitcoin to cut down on transaction costs and use their already in place  security infrastructure, until then I will manage that segment on my own

It's not profitable to deal with Chase cards if it will bring trouble later down the road so they had to likely close off that option.

Its funny to see these once innovative companies become Luddites as new technology grants opportunities.
The current social networks could have used bitcoin to their advantage while they also hold market share. Yet every day they lag and decide to wait they give other small companies the chance to create awesome solutions.
Eventually the most ambitious and creative thinkers will flock to these companies as there is the most possibility to create new services. 
Why stay with Facebook when the most you'll do is redesign the layout when you can help setup remittance or micro-payment services with features that were impossible to implement beforehand.
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:19:40
Your definitely right. As long as people are cloud mining; there is nothing they can do to prevent GHash from using their machines maliciously. Although I would argue that if they were to maliciously use machines that are pointed towards P2Pools, they would lose serious market confidence for short-term gain. 
Yet ideally people should request their machines be mailed to them. CEX.io (GHash.io is owned by CEX) offers miners to have their equipment mailed to them.

Sorry I would search through reddit if I wasn't crunched for time, but they make regular posts about events they hold, how much food they served per week, and how much they raised from fundraising events. 
Hell you can track the transactions sent to their donation address.


I suppose not, but they did post earlier about flooding in the forest they had to tend to, the price of bitcoin has been consistently dropping and they likely hold excess bitcoin instead of cashing for USD. 
Also it's fine to be critical, hell it's a good thing. I just think this thread has devolved into people beating up on for not doing something that doesn't necessarily affect the day-to-day operation of the Outpost. This thread could accomplish the same task with significantly less demoralization. 
I just don't want to see positive members of the community chastised for not-even-made mistakes. Open Book accounting would be great to have and I hope they can implement it, I just don't like the attitude by most (*not you!*) before there has been much response.

Please tell me what these areas are; that require half the network mining power to have incentives?
I'm stating the large pool/miner bit because just before you tried to make it seem like they were separate entities. Your taking that I out of context, I was clarifying your attempt to divide the problem in two when its really a single entity.
I trust the miner incentive as well, and I think that pool operators that act mischievously will receive repercussions. That's why I'm trying to bring up their history of being less then honest and their lack of interaction with the community. I would like these facts to be known before this becomes an actual problem. Its better to deal with while its just a brief "possibility". 
The concern with Ghash/CEX is since they have the largest single conglomeration of miners; future miners and current should look at GHas/CEX's history and involvement to see if they are a reputable company with bitcoin in its interests (as you said "the community would do if it became a concern"). 
You state that the community will react when GHash starts acting naughty... Where is this magic threshold that would make " feart mongering" *(I prefer to call it concern, but to each their own)* acceptable?

If your in the service industry, I've helped the service [TipBitco.in]( by creating a variety of tip cards to use.
The point is that it might be difficult to get customers to pay in bitcoin through conversation. You could ask every customer and it would be awkward most of the time for those that don't understand and waste your time asking. Yet if you could wear a small lanyard that said you accept bitcoin, people curious could ask questions, people with bitcoin could know you accept bitcoin, and people who have no idea won't bother asking.

@_date: 2014-06-13 17:08:17
I don't know why you are being downvotes. If bitcoin is to overcome the traditional payment networks, we need the incentives to align so that they reward miners just as much as the network they are securing. 
What we need is to have a dedicated push towards P2Pool technology and quickly develop the tools needed to easily get people onto these networks.
The more attention to this, the more devs look and poke around and the more likely people will donate given the right platform to do so.

Hey there +I'm actually looking to integrate bitcoin within a square-space page as well.
It's been really frustrating because I really want to use the pre-made "cart" setup that seamlessly works on mobile and desktop beautifully. Yet the only options I found were to make your own "button" which completely goes around the built-in shipping cart built into the website. 
How you found any success in integrating bitcoin to your SquareSpace? It's really frustrating that SquareSpace doesn't make this sort of customization possible from the get-go. 
All their beautiful tools and templates are useless if I can't use my designated payment methods. I've tried using WIX but when I view the page from mobile, everything is messed up and impossible to use.

Haha it's perfectly alright; I posted this somewhat with this expectation, thanks for letting it on easy.
I absolutely agree with you that banks are great social actors when their largest service is lending money to various enterprises to create different projects. Yet as the world becomes more globalized, banks become less local social actors and more of a bottlenecked gateway for payments between each other. They perform this function with various fees that increase with the order of distance and countries between economic actors (more fees as more hoops are needed to bridge gaps). 
That is what is meant to be said and perhaps it's simply not the best phrase at condensing that into an easily relatable one-liner. I apologize this uses wording that makes you feel like others will view this negatively. All is taken into consideration!

It's pretty gross to see the media trying to jump on a sensationalized news story without thinking of the wider repercussions. 
**This is a non-story.** Even if terrorists manage to use bitcoin to transfer wealth around, they cannot consistently raise large amounts of money through bitcoin because cashing out still deals with regular AML/KYC.


I think this is pretty despicable because it goes contrary to the social contract we make with one another to not let the ill actions of a few ruin society for us all. 
Terrorists use free speech, they use the internet, they use public roads, they use modern telephone communications: yet we don't limit access to these rights/services/institutions just because the bad guys use them too. 
Money is no different, it represents a society's attempts to allocate scarce resources. In a globalizing world we need to learn how to do this cooperatively in a much larger scale than ever before: fiat currencies will not get us there. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:25:48
The global economy would continue. It would seriously throw a wrench in things and require extensive rebuilding; but when it' rebuilt it wouldn't be based around the US anymore. 
The US is taking for granted that it's the world reserve currency. It's not a phenomenon that is unique to the US and different periods of history had different reserve currencies to be replaced by the next. 
The US *could* be adaptive and try to encourage new ideas that encourage participation and transparency. Start building platforms to host long term plans rather than short term political wins in a pointless tug-of-war. 
Until then I'd rather work with the ambitious folk testing this technology and making apps and services around it. They are the one with the ideas currently, and even if they aren't successful they are the ones to find the answers, not the government.

Understandable; I simply enjoy the service for it's ease of use and when  the shopping company had a problem their customer service was banger good. 
I know that for specific shops; ZincSave (another plugin) actually nets you few dollars off your next purchases at target/amazon/walmart etc. 
I usually follow an order of trying to support bitcoin accepting merchants, and then Zinc, and then snap as last resort. For me the extra layer of security by not handing out my credit card number is worth the peace of mind.

Well not quite.
The whole point of bitcoin is that it's inner incentives are trustless feedback loops to keep the system running. Without needing human involvement, such as system gains trust and admiration. 
Yet when this model shows weakness and then is temporarily vulnerable; it makes quite a bit of people uncomfortable. 
If this happens enough times, I could see a lot of seasoned bitcoiners lose faith. 
The community definitely responded strongly, but if we didn't the problem would be much worse without attention.

True, while I do want to stir up interest; not at the expense of furthering a negative image.
The idea behind the phrase is more that the alternative solution exists. Not so much that you should immerse yourself completely but just raising awareness that technology is solving and upgrading institutions that we otherwise deemed to sacred to disrupt. 
I have no control what others do, anyone is free to write or not write what they wish. The impact is only as successful as the idea is to generate collaboration with those freely participating.

This is why I think short term, competitive games are more feasible.
I used to play factions with a small group of friends. 4 on each side and we would build bases with absolutely no rules other then an initial 3 day build period. During that time you were completely free to raid at any time even if the other group wasn't online.
It made for some really interesting gameplay and a mad rush for obsidian to defend against TnT cannons. And even if you lost a bunch of loot, we always knew to keep some hidden in different areas, and regardless it added to the fun and difficulty of trying to progress over the other players.
I would love for there to be an incentive with bitcoin. Whether it simply be small groups of people getting together to rent a server for a month; or even incorporating uBTCs as items that people can steal from each other (or engage in trades).
Regardless of how it's implemented, I would love to see this used by the community to create some awesome games!

Yes, there are moments where you don't have enough short-term and then have to pay interest if you don't pay within a certain period.

That's interesting to me because when I use my friend's iPads I become incredibly frustrated how basic and unhelpful the OS was. 
Android offers onscreen widgets, better multi-tasking, allows apps to seemlessly use the function of others allowing unique experience based on app preference, uses storage as a USB which allows working on projects to use less workarounds, and can be customized for a variety of purposes and use apps not on the play store. 
I use a Nexus10 and I absolutely love the device. It's quick, easy to display screen on a TV, great Bluetooth and WiFi radio, holds charge relatively well, and it's screen is to die for. 
Honestly I can see why iPhones being more simple is attractive as a phone; but I want my tablet to be able to perform as closely to my computer as I can. And even though I use a mac I find android has much more "flow" when working with multiple apps and documents.

Are you purposefully spreading misinformation? They have already breached 51% of the mining power briefly. 
They have ALREADY committed double spends back in 2013. The community at the time didn't have fear of GHash and blammed  the gambling sites for not waiting for 6-confirmations. GHash/CEX said it was the doings of a rouge employee. 
Whether or not they want to implement a 51% is irrelevant. Do they have absolutely security in that there is no way for their pool to be hacked and used maliciously? Even if that doesn't occur, when they consolidate power they are prone to legal rulings. 
Are you reading or listening to any of the discussions? Or are you just trying to act smart by being critical without justification?

That's such a narrow look at how this tech works though because the alternative is the US banking system which is far more corrupt compared to a decentralized legder of a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is by far a more egalitarian currency. Not because of who owns it, but because of who controls it.
Bitcoin is equal to all participants because there are zero boundaries on participating. You can do whatever you want and no transaction will be censored. You can build your own apps and scripts to automate your tasks.
Considering there isn't a better alternative, bitcoin is far more egalitarian than fiat. Way more inclusive, global, managed by no one, and people voluntarily choose it meaning they prefer it's "algorithm/management" over other systems.
And there still is bitcoin that will exist, that hasn't been created yet.

Its truly ridiculous that these tax laws don't allow LIFO. This is a deflationary "commodity" so using FIFO is directly screwing over long-term bitcoin holders.

I know this might not be a popular opinion, but I think with the right backing this idea could be a great gateway for bitcoin to further enter the economy. 
While I would never want to actually hold RealCoins myself, they would let developers to nit-pick the benefits they want when designing applications. If you can trade RealCoins on number of exchanges for bitcoin, and do it instantly without waiting for bank transfers and other institutional delays: you add that much easier access to the bitcoin ecosystem. 
If bitcoin is going to grow then the technology will be used by different actors in different ways. The point of open source is that these ideas can come from anywhere and be anything without anyone blocking that innovation. 
I'm curious to see how this plays out. Yet I can't imagine not falling prey to the same circumstances as the Liberty Dollar and Liberty Reserve.

If you have an android, I would suggest [Bitcoin Wallet]( or [Mycelium](
If you have an iPhone then Blockchain.info mobile website is fine, yet I would suggest coinbase with 2FA enabled. (Keep small amounts on this as if it's a real life wallet you carry on you). 
Yet I don't think the wallet was the issue, as you said you had a confirmation with 10 minutes. It's standard, especially for mobile and small amounts, **to allow payments that have zero confirmations**. The reason being it's incredibly unlikely that someone would have the power to double spend the network, especially for something so small.  
This is not your fault of course, but personally I would have helped the store owner's better understand their implementation. That's an error on their part, yet understandable considering the newness of this protocol.

This is the main reason I love bitcoin; it's problems are not decided by a central authority. Every asshole has the ability to voice their own solutions and convince others to engage in other solutions.
I'm assuming that the end result of this will be the creation of easy to access P2Pools. Before this was not really an issue and thus didn't have many tools, yet after this scare I'm sure that there will be some brilliant solutions which will take the community by storm.
After all, we are very much pro-decentralization! Decentralized solutions that are easy to implement will be done.

I said sorry for asking a bit different of a question but I'd love to simply draw up a qr code and then send the funds straight from my phone no matter where I am.

I absolutely agree, but currently that is not the case and it limits the use of bitcoin in certain [situations]( 
Today, I use bitcoin actively for my online and real life shopping. I only use bitcoin when I get a discount over USD and still end up using it quite often.
Thus I find real world benefit using bitcoin within the existing world today *(on top of easy pay for my freelance work)*.
Yet volatility today limits how I want to use this technology. I would like to morph it to other use-cases but limited by the lack of ability to selectively use parts of the bitcoin network I want. 
In the end these services will not be as neccessary and will likely form other uses. Yet today, right now -- this type of utility is exactly what the public is asking for.

Yikes, aren't you a bit pretentious. 
Everything is an "untrusted" security model until proven. For the past 5 years with increasing market cap: bitcoin seems to have a proven security model through it's internal incentives. 
When I say "work with", I'm referring to how we "worked with" TCP/IP to build the internet despite it not having the capability of natively sending voice, video, and other media through the protocol. Yet it was good enough to begin building networks and solutions on top of it, and thus the internet today uses a protocol that was "good enough" to "work with" with several different ways to send video, images, and other media. 
*Back to the discussion*
Bitcoin's miner incentive is not fundamentally broken. Given equal access to resources; the way miners are rewarded combined with difficulty readjustments makes for a very competitive and decentralized way to transmit unique digital tokens.
ASICs made the game unequal because of the infrastructural bottle neck that rewards large investments over small players. Yet this is a short-term issue that is already seeing market diversification and combining power with others in the form of pools. 
The incentives of Bitcoin work, the bottleneck will not last forever, and P2P pools solve any threat of 51% by removing the ability of a central party to redirect the mining pool. On top of this, P2P pools reward participants more centralized mining pools because there are less actors that take up fees, and services are more diverse as they are provided by various developers rather then closed companies.
Currently it is more user friendly to simply cloud mine: I get that. But to say that the security incentives are fundamentally flawed is a bit quick to the trigger.

Use a LiveCD with Tails or Ubuntu loaded on it. 
Have electrum preinstalled and then only copy the seed onto a piece of paper. 
This way your wallet is not stored anywhere other than the piece of paper and you can recover any time by slipping in the CD and booting up your computer. 
If this is too much work, make a BIP38 encrypted wallet and use Crypto cards (although I'd reccomend splitting the wealth onto a few cards depending on how much you have.)

Me either, I'm glad where researching bitcoin has led me towards. 
Another fun website to show off is the [CPI calculator offered by the government]( It lets you compare the purchasing power of the dollar between two different points in time. This concept shows that as the government prints more and more money, you need to own more money to purchase the same amount of goods. 
This inflation makes putting your money in the bank a guaranteed sink. The best you can do is make good investments in order to keep even on your purchasing power over a span of 40-years (not that long of a time for money to seriously devalue!)
The interest on your bank account does not overcome the inflation by the government.

This is the same advice that can be misinterpreted and used incorrectly.
If you accept Bitcoin through services such as bitpay or coinbase. Use 0 confirmations. Otherwise your customer will have to wait 3-10 minutes for the transaction to go through. There has not been any cases of fraud despite use of 0 confirmation. And especially if dealing with smaller amounts of money; you don't want to trade off security with creating a bad customer experience.

Others have already said this: we need B2B. 
Currently methods to hedge value, as in retain the value of held bitcoin, has already been developed and can be easily used in these situations. Yet it would be great if merchant payments could be immediately forwarded to supply chains for a new dynamic payment system. 
Ideally a system which buys it self back naturally. Like when inventory is bought by consumers from a merchant, the purchase would follow a special algorithm to send money to the necessary supplier and arrange for replacement.

BitPay handles all the invoices automatically. The customer was using PayPal and credit cards beforehand, and had no problem adding invoices received from bitpay to this mix. I'm not totally sure what setup they were using.
Yet I was able to setup the service with a specific catalog on bitpay, and then have a button call up an invoice with the specific service requested. I'm no coder and I was able to follow a YouTube video and a few Google searches to get it working.
&amp;gt; people actually pay using their service
I don't understand what you mean by this, clients I've done work for have had plenty of clients pay in bitcoin (yet again they definitely target the crowd). The merchants that pass down these savings to customers see the most community reaction. Gyft's 3% cash back has earned them a strong reputation within the community.
&amp;gt; so what you mean by no cost...
Okay hold up, I'll just clarify right here what I meant. I'm not trying to confuse or mislead anyone.
*  Setup costs (as in the literal dollar amount to gather all the right services, place on website, and get them running to accept the first payment) is zero. *I'm not saying you magically can accept bitcoin without effort, but you will not have to spend any money to start receiving money to your bank account)*
* Transaction fees are significantly **smaller then Fiat payment systems**. To accept bitcoin us free, and to convert it to USD can range from 1% per transaction or a flat rate of $30/month for unlimited transactions.
*  You will have Zero charge back costs from your bitcoin customers. 
*  Money will be safely in your bank account significantly faster then from competing Fiat transaction systems (usually by end of day). 
Any issues with these statements? I apologize if I made it seem like I meant something other then these points. *Its hard to stay on the point when typing from a mobile.*

It would be interesting to market devices which run on practically no energy that solo mine bitcoin. 
Market it as: buy a bitcoin lottery ticket, which you have a chance of winning 25 BTC every day!

There are some pretty good security methods that let you have awesome security without much hassle.
**Electrum** is a client that gives you 12 random words which you can write down on paper easily. This lets you achieve "cold storage" (really safe, offline storage) by making a wallet on Electrum *(on a safe computer)*. Here are the basic steps:
1. [Download Electrum]( and go Offline
2. Install Electrum *on a safe computer/[Live-OS]( *([here is a video demonstration]( skip to 3:30 for quick visual of wallet creation)*
3. Copy down the seed by writing it on a piece of paper. **Do not copy this down electronically**.
4. Store the paper safely *(ex. store a copy in your house and in a bank safe box perhaps)*
5. Copy the **master** public key
6. Delete the wallet, shutdown electrum, delete electrum, delete all files relating to bitcoin.
Viloa, you now should have a bitcoin wallet that you can safely send money to, without worry of a hacker getting into your computer. You can send money to any address on the master public key, and you can later retrieve this by simply entering the 12-word seed on any computer with electrum. 
This method makes it relatively easy for anyone to have great cold storage (long term savings) security. *I would argue this method is better then using paper wallets because printers have been known to store copies of what they print. If I'm storing money on a piece of paper, I don't want the printer manufacturers to potentially have that information. *
For every day spending, you can trust small amounts with coinbase/phone wallet and then send excess amounts to your savings when they bread your trust threshold. 
Here is 500 bits to try setting it up before becoming invested. +@_date: 2014-01-22 17:05:11
Yes but there are easy methods to safeguard against this compromising your account.
Usually phone wallets encrypt the wallet with a password, and on top of that, an encrypted version of the file can be uploaded to various cloud sites (IN A ENCRYPTED WRAPPER).

I understand your making a hyperbole but it's not as difficult as your making it out to be.
Localbitcoins is a service which is essentially the craigslist of bitcoin. It's very easy to find reputable vendors (with rankings and comments from previous buyers), and request to meet in a public setting (such as a bank lobby or area with cameras). 
Because of the various banking institution regulations, and (as said earlier) buyer protection mechanisms built into paypal; it's silly to sell through these methods. With these methods it would be no problem for you to pay with paypal, get your coins and then reverse the transaction without any recourse for the seller. That's the fault of the banking system, and which is why there are lengthy steps to use these methods. 
CoinTap is coming out with cards that you'll find at local supermarkets which will let you buy BTC that way, but that's in the works. 
Bitcoin is very new and various enterprises are fighting to be the first to provide various services. You'll be surprised where it will be at the end of 2014.
As you said; you want to get in before it becomes mainstream.
**tl;dr**: Use LocalBitcoins; you can use cash and find reputable vendors (all of whom may choose to transact in different methods giving you flexibility).

Rooting definitely decreases security because a virus or malicious program has more access to your phone's built in security overrides *(put very roughly/simply)*
I would recommend 3 wallets. 
*  One for cold storage that you never withdraw from (long term savings)
*  a warmer wallet of which you use to hold semi-large amounts of funds. Crypto cards, electrum on a LiveCD work okay for this. Essentially this is the wallet you use to hold most of your active funds. 
*  hot wallet on your phone. I personally love the app mycelium because its chock full of features. Put only enough coin that you plan to spend in the day. When you need to reup, simply load from your LiveCD 
This should isolate your funds enough to prevent hackers from stealing one big pot of coins 
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:20:28

I'm right there with you. I've been scoping out and requesting if different servers would be interested in using Bitcoin in game. 
Here is a [comment]( I posted on a specific sub when directed to make the suggestion by the OP.

Thanks for bringing this up!
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:10:30
Nothing's wrong with eligius other then it would be better to direct efforts towards a more long-term strategy.
Let's focus on P2Pools and development and tools made for these pools. It would be a much better way at distributing the mining power to avoid 51% ownership of the hashing power. 
The more efficient we make these systems, and community to maintain donations and documentation, the more P2Pools become a natural profitable choice.

This is exactly the same as bitcoin. The whole point is that a dialogue must be opened between the seller and buyer.
While this seems strange, it encourages vendors to sell more services and encourages consumers to select vendors with credibility or in situations that minimize risk (such as me giving graphic design client free drafts until we settle on an idea that they like). 
Bitcoin = Digital cash
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:40:57
So tell me, what are the thresholds that GHash/CEX.io have in place to prevent going above different hashrates? 
BTCGuild had commitments in the past, and increased fees and restricted membership once they began rising above the thresholds they outlines.
GHash/CEX have not stated any mitigation plan, and despite saying they respect the bitcoin community; they have not answered or addressed any concerns by the community. They aren't deaf, they are purposely ignoring the issue.
In 2013 they were in the spotlight for double-spending against gambling sites. Essentially making bets and just reversing transactions that they didn't win. 
**GHash/CEX is the most pretty/user-friendly/popular evil company**. 
* They have the looks
* They nailed the marketing
* They made hashing liquidity popular
* They used the image of an honest/transparent company to wrap up the package *(but this wrapper was a lie)*
If the P2Pool network gains 70% of the hashing network, then I think that's okay. It would be much more difficult to pull off a 51% attack within a P2Pool.

Yikes dude, I mean I definitely am not bullish on the US Dollar or Euro, but I would definitely not put all my eggs into a technology that is still figuring itself out. 
The blockchain is the true revolution behind bitcoin and it will change the world; yet this same technology is already being used for decentralized cloud storage, decentralized asset exchanges, decentralized twitter platforms, etc. In this regard bitcoin was the first "app" or technology to be built on this blockchain platform and it might very well be that bitcoin is not specific app to take over the world trade *(or it might, who knows!)*.
The point is: it's great your enthusiastic about the technology but don't let that blind you the greater context of things. This technology can be used to create anything and it's very risky putting all your faith in that bitcoin might arbitrarily be the one to over come all in the next 20 years. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:33:22
I don't understand why sites that want to monetize don't offer paywalls of like a nickle or something like that. Bitcoin is perfect for cheap and hassle-less paywall implementations. 
Perhaps you get 15 free articles a week and when you pay a nickle you get unlimited access for the week. Keep it low barrier to entry and reward a ton for little (perhaps a dime or some other micro transaction). 
Bitcoin can do small payments much easier than credit cards and the like. While sub-penny transactions wouldn't work, this could work very well to monetize articles without needing to be paid from the source of the story.

I'd say a great benefit is the ability for applications to interoperate with each other.
PayPal, google wallet, venmo—these services are all on their own private ledger and don't interact with each other.
Yet within bitcoin, all the different services work together and are compatible with each other without fees to transfer between services. It's all on the blockchain.
In short, I think of bitcoin like android vs iPhone. On android all the apps are able to call functions of other apps, so everything can reference and use the functions of other apps. Yet on iPhone every app is isolated from the other apps and there isn't much connection between apps.

I've been doing Graphic design for quite a while from and have been absolutely astounded at the ease of doing work for anyone anywhere. 
After payments I have the option of cashing out through my preferred exchange (coinbase) or holding. 
I think once the service industry takes realization of this, it will spread like wildfire. It is SOOO much more convenient using bitcoin and then cashing out to my bank account on coinbase then it is to ask for paypal information (which is significantly more limiting and less desirable for strangers engaging for spontaneous freelancing).

Think about it this way: *Changetip is one of the first user-friendly bitcoin services that is unparalleled by a fiat equivalent*.
When people first hear about bitcoin and are excited enough to try it out, *which seems more exciting?*
*  Buying something online with bitcoin (that you can already buy with fiat)
*  Sending out micro-tips over the internet (which has never been possible before bitcoin)
Like [Counterparty]( and [OpenBazaar]( changetip allows people to play with bitcoin in a way that's completely unique and new to financial applications.


If reddit was geo-locked to specific areas, then perhaps such a startup could flourish. 
But it's not: reddit and social media exists uniformly across the entire world. A global community may interact uniformly on the net yet use different currencies and trusted third parties to conduct online commerce. If you were to make a service that accepted fiat to send via social media: the startup would have to basically find a way to accept every single currency &amp; financial third party without transaction costs: 
*Thus it's impossible to make changetip without a cryptocurrency*.


Some people are more generous than others. Those that give out $3 tips might be bitcoin rich from being an early adopter or they are simply excited to show off the technology. 
For most people, sending the equivalent of $0.01 ^over the internet is minimal enough to not be a big deal yet to someone who wrote a thoughtful post, it's a nice surprise. **Thus this interaction is addicting.**

First off, I just wanted to say thank you for taking up the DarkMarket project. It is truly revolutionary in the fact that it safely brings together buyer and sellers with no middleman. Because of this I can see countless services and   infrastructure based off of the open bazaar due to being an open source protocol. 
I run ***a platform for magic the gathering players to easily buy and sell cards from one another. Magic players have the unique benefit that they usually have massive collections of cards that are valuable but they probably won't use. Because cards are so light, you can easily ship them very quickly and cheaply using standard US mail. This allows players to sell valuable cards they don't want to buy valuable cards from another player. 


Before bitmit went down, it was the most popular way to list your cards. Yet unfortunately it did not have search parameters that were bitcoin friendly. This makes it difficult to browse cards when your looking for a specific match (such as only a green human with more then 2 ATK). If these parameters existed, it would give much better coverage to people listing their cards. 
Would there be a labeling system that would allow a community of magic players to easily create search filters?
Open Street Map allows for custom filters which allows sites like coinmap to run; would there be a similar setup to allow niche markets to have more browsing-friendly features?

I would like to start playing around with BIP38 encrypted wallets. More specifically I want to learn how to encrypt an electrum seed and still be read by bitcoin wallet apps.
If I want to create an every day wallet that I use to spend from, what's the best way to go about this? 
I'm trying to work on my own solutions that let's me spend from a wallet without holding the funds on a phone or computer. 
I realize you have to sweep funds completely for paper wallets, so with this in mind would I have to sweep, spend what I want, and then send what's left manually back to the public key of the paper wallet? 
Or is the cold storage ruined when sweep the funds once? 
I know crypto cards operates on this but not sure what they do to get around this. I definitely don't want to buy a crypto card if its only good for one sweep.

BitPay and Coinbase handle all the bitcoin transactions automatically. The merchant doesn't have to know anything about bitcoin in order to receive it and get USD in their bank account. 


Bitcoin usage definitely follows the price movements. This is especially true so early on in the adoption period with so many advocates. 
When the price is constantly descending, individuals are likely to cut back on their bitcoin spending until the price begins to tick upwards again. Yet the same is true for when the price is ascending, as people will have more money then they "put in" and thus have more incentive to realize those profits in purchasable goods/services.
I'm not trying to misinform, you will definitely not suddenly increase profits or gain significant traffic because you accept bitcoin. Like everything, it requires work and dedication to the community. 
Currently I just used [CoinForCoffee]( at a local starbucks because I forgot my wallet while responding to you xD


There are two sides to this coin. Yes customers lose product resolution through their credit card, yet they also gain peace of mind in the fact that they don't have to give out any financial information to a company they just met. It's pretty easy to find reviews on websites, and see their history of happy/unhappy customers, and when this isn't acceptable there are bonafide escrow systems that perform the same system as credit cards. 
With recent hacks of Target, PayPal/GoDaddy, eBay, etc: it's becoming more obvious that spreading your credit card and financial information with every website is an increasingly dangerous practice. 
With bitcoin the user simply whips out their phone and scans a QR code. No exchange of financial information other then shipping information (which isn't even needed in service transactions). 


Touche. Yet it seems like you have very limited knowledge of bitcoin systems. We can learn from each other :)

He can do whatever the hell he wants with his money.
I know your trying to be polite but bitcoin does not hinge on one person cashing out. And if it did then I would jump ship immediately.
The community saw that an admin of Wikipedia started buying bitcoin and as a result we wanted to flood his address with funds so that he could have a gage of interest. What he decides to do with those funds is up to him. 
I doubt he would delete the address because it's one of many as a part of his coinbase account. We can keep sending him money and the total amount given won't change (thus still a good talley).

Wrong, because with PayPal, Google Wallet, or any other service I have to pay fees for accepting an international transfer, pay the exchange rate fee, and then the buyer can reverse the transaction later with minimal effort since PayPal and these services are customer oriented. 
I don't have the time or money to work on projects that will be "charged back" and I don't have the enforcement mechanisms to prevent them from acting distant. 


And what happens when the "merchant" is just another individual? Yes it flips the paradigm and brings about some negative parts but it also comes with new possibilities.


I'm sorry for acting to "hype" or whatever. I'm not trying to state that bitcoin is widely used and thus it's discount benefits are it's main attractions -- this is only true for select merchants that decide to do this. 
Yet if bitcoiners get the "bitcoin way" then this would occur more often and discounts might become more steep. 
As of now though things are in beta mode. 


How am I reaching at all? I never lost control of my bitcoin wallet even though I wasn't super careful with my phone. I made a backup of the wallet way back and then on this fateful day I simply recovered it from my storage and entered the encryption password at my leisure. My bitcoins were never gone and always within reach. It's as easy at that. 
It's incredibly different from getting a notification to tell you that despite using your card normally, your account is racking up charges. Credit Card fraud isn't because people are stupid but because the system is impossible to secure when it revolves around keeping numbers secure yet open for use at the same time. 
You don't expose yourself to fraudulent purchases of your bitcoin wallet when you spend from it. That's that.

I feel like this comment is just being cheeky. 
In actuality there are more complex factors at play. One, when money starts to appreciate in value people begin to feel more wealthy. This is called the [wealth effect](
Basically as people start to have more purchasing power, they feel less guilty making extra purchases with the "free" money earned from holding. 
Plus lets not forget that "savings = deferred spending"
Your assumption assumes that everyone will be saving and no one will be spending. It doesn't work like that. Time is a continuum and while some people are saving, others are spending their savings. 
Too much variables to say deflationary money causes less business, because it definitely makes the economy stronger as a whole when everyone has savings to back up potential good investments later.

I think charity is the best place for bitcoin. As long as it's a respectable organization where the funds will go to legitimate causes then it only highlights the power of bitcoin.
By getting more individuals to work to bitcoin donations, it increases people aware of it and highlights it's properties. Also it makes for positive news to contrast drug markets.
Your linked example proves my point. The develops of VLC player were born away by the bitcoin community. They are a great organization providing media capability on all services; and I doubt their bitcoin experience will remain hidden now that it's on reddit.
Being able to accept money from around the world for free by posting an address **is** something I want people to be proud of.

[Coinapult's video]( highlighted a use-case that I personally would find useful. 
**I want to collect rent from my roommates in bitcoin.**
Currently I have everything neatly lined up in a spreadsheet that everyone can view. All the bills are split evenly and the amount everyone owes dynamically updates with every adjustment to the ledger. 
*Thus for recording and even paying most of my bills; it's done electronically and I can do it from my computer. This makes it easy to do and record to keep everyone in the house on the same page.*
**Yet when it comes to collecting the money... what a mess!**
*  I have to physically receive the check from each roommate and I need to account for time it takes to call home and have a check mailed. 
*  I have to deposit these checks by traveling to an ATM/Bank and add the amount to my account. *I have had rare occasions of a familiar ATM being broken or the web portal of my Bank being unavailable.* 
*  Once the money is in my bank account, I need to write a new check to send in the mail or deliver to my landlord (more driving).
Because this is such a broken up process, there are times when I forget a check or leave something which throws another wrench in the day as I fix my folly. 
Overall, I would much prefer if my roommates could easily transfer bitcoin to me and then I lock the amounts needed for the end of the month to send off to my landlord and bills. ***All from my phone/computer***. 
*Thus it would be great to have a service with an API that lets me or others build applications specifically for this purpose and with automatic logging. It would be easy to create once the service of holding the USD &amp; BTC for hedging is available.*

Merchants who exchange for fiat are not "freeloaders" and add value by giving people using bitcoin actual avenues to use it.

In the grand scheme of things; I think these types of situations are better for Bitcoin in the long run. In the short to medium: I have no idea or guess how far it will lower price; but I think the reactions caused by these types of events beneficial
* causes massive sell-offs from big holders and further distributes coins towards more individuals.
* "Need is the necessity of invention" will cause many exchanges to beef up technology and prevent future disruptions 
* Generates media coverage of bitcoin; bad news drops the price towards appealing levels and causes some people to get in "while it's low"
* 2014 has already seen a steep rise in merchants, services, and investment firms getting into bitcoin behind the scenes, thus a crash isn't likely to bring it to zero.
**These are just my guesses**; *I have zero qualifications to assert this is true thus please feel free to contradict me*

You don't think so? While currently we have the methods to implement payment processing into code and send payments internationally; to do so requires so much man power rather then using pure code to run the system. 
And beforehand, if you wanted to participate in the global economy; you were required to have a bank account. Bitcoin is making that requirement less and less relevant and thus enables wider access of innovation and markets. 
Bitcoin solved the unbanked problem *(well, kicked the can to litmus of those who are able to connect someway to the internet)*, it enables sending money directly to another party, and enables anyone to develop applications for it. 
None of these properties were even being considered by banks to be solved.

They provide the most user-friendly interface in the mining business and offer competitive rates. Plus they offer a unique marketplace where people can buy hashing power off each other, adding liquidity to mining power. 
This has allowed them to grow quickly and invest in machinery to control a large part of the bitcoin transaction network. This is dangerous because the larger of a threshold they grow, they weaken the security of a growing billion dollar currency. 
**GHash/CEX stated that they are an honest and transparent company that is dedicated towards respecting the bitcoin community.** ***And then they broke these very promises and have not engaged the community during this event***.
*  They said they would implement mitigation efforts to avoid reaching certain hashing power thresholds *(PS, they never said at what levels and they haven't follow through)
* They haven't been talking with the community during this uproar or do anything to show what is going on. *(Thus they lie about respecting the community and being transparent)*
They have deceived a lot of honest miners looking to easily get into bitcoin by pretending to be an honest and good company. This recent event has shown that they are not capable of the position they are in because they have already broken promises they made. 
BTCGuild by comparison made commitments to prevent breaking certain thresholds and followed through with their promises and commitment to the community. They have also offered returns in the past to people who have accidentally included large transaction fees.
We should all shame GHash/CEX for not engaging the community. The uproar would have been much less severe if there was any contact at all.

What are you talking about? We have used complete fiat money for only 40 years. Talk about a short term experiment and definitely not "the way its always been" in the slightest. 
We were taken off the gold standard with Nixon, not that far ago at all. 
In that time of using incredibly inflationary currency we see busts and highs (volatility). Shouldn't this have been fixed if we are sacrificing our savings? 
The world ran on gold for thousands of years. Plus for a century there almost no rise in prices - stability. 
The world we have today is based on the success of yesteryear: which used gold (a deflationary currency). 
This is what I'm talking about, there is so much ignorance about money that the second they hear deflation they think bad. 
There is good and bad inflation/deflation. That's besides the point and doesn't affect the economy like you think it does. Its not black and white and history is there to show your statement is way over generalized.

My hope is that with latency being an important factor in P2Pools, the p2pool network would be ideal to expand because people will look for smaller pools closer to their location (less ping) which should prevent future Ghash's. 
Yet who knows, great milestone to hit! Let's keep that number going up!

Damn... That's frustrating. I wish the community could jump back to 2013 where there was ideals but it was still majorly seen *(here in r/bitcoin)* as an experiment with interesting possibilities.


Perhaps in *(although I'd still say that's a stretch)*, but I'm still in bitcoin bubbles/crews/groups in real life and everyone is much more *sane* and reasonable than compared to the libertarian/anarchist/conspiracist stereotype I see thrown around.

Remember that target scandal where hackers stole credit card information off of their servers? That is going to become more and more common considering it's common practice for companies to hold onto all the credit card information of their customers on their databases.
With bitcoin a customer is completely protected from these events and can purchase with confidence. 
This isn't so much an issue now, but the FBI released a statement earlier mentioning that this is likely going to become more and more common. 
Credit Cards are incredibly insecure. They operate on the basis of you giving out all the sensitive details of your financial information and hope that it only lands in the right hands (forever). That's a bit ridiculous in the modern age.

Not quite, for that 3% they split 20 blocks of 25 BTC each. Thus if you were mining in P2Pool there likely wasn't that large of a group and thus each person is getting large payouts. The pool split over $290,000 just so far today.
That's an incentive for other miners to switch over.

I think that's the obvious answer. Merchants need to pay bills and currently there is not a B2B sector of bitcoin. Unless they can pay their bills in bitcoin (and perhaps get a discount to incentivize them) they likely won't be interested in using bitcoin in any other fashion other than a transaction network. 
*That's okay though*


There needs to be ways for businesses to pay their bills in bitcoin and it should be cheaper and easier than current methods. 
On top of this the value needs to be stable; but services like bitreserve and coinapult already prove you can separate bitcoin from it's volatility. For a large business, they can simply hedge risk between transactions using exchanges to store value in USD in-between transit and deals and then exit using bitcoin. 
Once these channels are solidified it will decrease the volatility of bitcoin by allowing more people to enter it safely and without them worrying about risk.

I've actually been using bitcoin more and more for all my regular purchases. Starbucks, amazon through purse.io, gyft, regular bitcoin retailers, and snapcard make it really easy to almost entirely use bitcoin. 
It sounds silly and I know your going to think anyone using bitcoin regularly is a loon but it's actually very liberating and I enjoy having unparalleled access to my funds. Once you spend some time researching it, bitcoin doesn't need a support staff because it's built to avoid those problems if you do proper prior security measures (they aren't even that difficult to get pretty awesome security). 
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:34:51

@_date: 2014-04-26 19:08:32
Because there is a verifiable receipt proving purchase. 
If you send me an address that I pay, when you don't followup with the service then I have proof of fraud. This means bad business falls quickly and good business doesn't lose profit from using a payment processor or chargebacks (which obviously become large costs as the business scales).
Creditcards, checks, and ACH are not protocols; they are services run by gianormous corporations that need to employ vast amounts of people purely to run payment processing the same way bitcoin does (albeit at currently much higher volumes). 
This doesn't even take into account the extra institutions involved and fees incurred when preforming global payments; and the time it takes to complete and resolve these transactions. 
That's my enthusiasm for the experiment that bitcoin is, and I believe that these qualities will make it a superior payment network then we have today. Maybe your right, the world prefers reversible transactions and then in that case bitcoin will inevitably fail and another protocol will rise in it's place. I just don't think this will happen.

Look its fine that your showing a counterpoint but could you stop being so pretentious


You don't understand smart contracts. An autonomous car could use a smart contract to pick up riders, buy itself repairs, and manage other functions without need for a person pushing the buttons at different decisions. This has nothing to do with the legal system but is a way for technology to complete actions autonomously without need for input.
And I made this argument of bitcoin being the underlying infrastructure is to tackle the "intrinsic value" argument.
Whether or not the value is a penny or $100, the blockchain is a very useful infrastructure that exists for the world to build on top of. That's not worthless and enables things to happen that otherwise would be prohibitory.


Oh yes it will. Notary is just to prove that something happened at time X. The blockchain does exactly this without the need for this trusted 3rd party. You can even have a blockchain receipt to prove your case in a regular legal environment. It's impossible to counterfeit a notary on the blockchain so it's absolutely useable in traditional legal situations.
For example: if bitpay had to build its own payment infrastructure to process transactions, similar to PayPal and MasterCard's huge server rooms and people maintaining them, would it even be able to exist? No because they are able to use openly available infrastructure to build their services.

I absolutely agree with you. Building wealth is difficult, and being able to have that stored without worry is a standard of life that we should not take for granted.
Bitcoin can actually be stored in ways that are leagues more secure then any possible bank setup. Yet to maintain even decent security setup requires a great bit of research and dedication. I do not ignore this
Luckily though anyone in the world is allowed to create services and solutions that make it easier for anyone to have better security. There are ways to go; yet the space has been improving and will get there. 


Ooops, I did not phrase my original statement clearly  because I meant the opposite of what your saying. 
* In 2008, interchange fees (the transaction fees in credit cards) totaled [$48 billion dollars.]( As in the economy lost $48 billion of economic energy purely to push numbers into different accounts. That's on average $400 per American family. 
* [40% of consumers are engaged with sub-optimal credit agreements]( due to lack of education on the topic *(not everything is impervious to lack of knowledge)* and thus adding to this loss of economic energy
* *[competition among card networks]( may potentially make payment rewards too generous, and thus deteriorate social welfare and its distribution. The situation may 
potentially be so dangerous that it requires public policy interventions*
Transaction fees were needed to maintain hierarchical business structures to maintain the payment network. Bitcoin inherently transforms this by allowing instant transfer of wealth instantly and securely to anyone with an address. Banks could use bitcoin internally the same way bitpay does for customers and offering USD into bank accounts cheaper then **any** payment provider on the web.

I actually began working on in the summer of 2013 and it helped me get into bitcoin (I wanted to earn it not buy it initially while it was still relatively unknown). 
In that time I worked with various clients and met some really awesome people. If you look at the subreddit logo, I actually made that for a contest in the sub! :)


I handle it like all my other graphic design, bitcoin doesn't complicate. I simply approach developers, and if they are interested I'll quickly sketch ideas and make rough drafts to give them an idea (for free). Once they begin to like it I'll work with them to refine the draft to what they want (I find clients prefer to have input, and are able to help when they have an image to directly critique and add comments), and then when they want to actually use the image; I'll request the payment.
Once the payment goes through I'll send them the file with transparency (all drafts have watermarks and not transparent).
This way I have no incentive to accept payment and then ditch, and also after I put in all the work I wouldn't want to leave without being paid. 
I haven't had any problems with this method and it allows clients to try out my skills before paying for them :)

dude... not cool. When it comes to charity don't be a fool who makes helping people a political thing. 
To be honest, the altcoin hate is getting ridiculous. What coin do you think alt coins use to cash out? All liquidity uses BTC which drives up transaction volume with the benefit of these guys testing all sorts of ideas. 
**Bitcoin is a goddamn silverback ape,** nothing is taking it down. But it's also open source meaning other currencies will form by the nature of freaking open source. The very part that you love about bitcoin being so open is the reason alt coins exist. Thus having hate for this property of the bitcoin world is ridiculous. 
Donate or not, but I just find your statement so disheartening and cold. What's the point of being angry at people using alt coins?

These are light clients which do not require downloading the entire block chain. This is much better for light users of bitcoin who don't wish to download a large file. 
**But these options are only good if you plan to hold bitcoin.**
If you plan on immediately selling these bitcoins for USD in order to contribute towards Wikipedia financing, I'd suggest simply securing your coinbase account with 2FA.

On the merchant side Newegg started to finally accept bitcoin and bitpay now has over 30k merchants! It's very cool to see the industry starting to slowly adapt to bitcoin and the merchant adoption is outpacing consumer adoption (not necessarily a bad thing!)

You fail to recognize the benefits of open source. No one would trust their coins with software or hardware that wasn't done in this manner; and thus it has an entire community of invested security individuals that pick everything apart before it becomes public.
Also, the hack would have to be within geographical proximity as these devices would not connect to the internet. This makes hacks even less likely and impossible to hack en masse.
Also this is under the pretense that these devices won't use encryption; which they most certainly will. Simply running the devices through similar processes of TrueCrypt making extracting data from devices useless.

I think services like this; not circle will bring bitcoin to the masses.
Bitcoin is
* a transaction network
* an international token of exchange
* a store of value
When individuals can separate the parts they want at will, more things are possible and more people can dip their toes in the water. This also gives utility already using bitcoin. 
For example; I already love using bitcoin to get discounts but now I can get my roomates to pay rent in bitcoin without the value changing a month from now. That's useful.

Hey guess what, the world doesn't revolve around you.
I made a post on reddit with specific benefits offered by using bitcoin. I'm pretty sure you don't have a problem with the clarification of those initial statements.
Then you asked my stance on various other issues stemming from this; I like discussion I'll talk. 
But from my perspective I really don't give two hoots what you think or do, your just a random comment on a response I had. Any discussion further is purely for my own amusement, and it turns from idle banter to character attacks then count me out.
I have no problem with your critiques of bitcoin, and they are challenges which are being worked on by people around the world. There were problems in 2012 that don't exist today, and that trend isn't slowing down. 
Your a lame troll. If you talked like this to people in real life then I doubt you'd hold many friends. Since I'm assuming you have friends, there is a discrepancy between the way you treat others when your identity is masked. That is pathetic, call me stupid all you want at least I'm open to learning. You'll always be an asshole 


Mind you a lot of services that perform bitcoin transactions do so off-blockchain. 
Coinbase and changetip both keep the majority of their transactions off the blockchain.
I'm not saying that it accounts for all of it, or it means transactions are growing or not, just that your analysis doesn't include the full picture.

**Security** 
I prefer to make transactions through bitcoin on the net because I can guarantee that a hacker or fraudster can't use that transaction data to screw me over later.  
This summer my card was defrauded 2 times from a city I haven't visited for months right before I had to leave for travel. Thus I had to go through a travel excursion with no credit card -- which is very annoyingly inconvenient. Every time I use my CC, I expose my card to another vector of hack/fraud. 
Plus it's easier -- instead of filling out a form I scan a QR code. Incredibly easy. 
**Trustless Payment Resolution**
I do graphic design *so that international part is important to me when working in a global world*. Yet let's say even for a contract within the US, I like using bitcoin because I can have the entire conversation and payment resolution without even needing to know their name or where they are from. I can be sure they can't jack the funds back later and it takes away the worry of being scammed for making free small graphics &amp; media. As a college student, this is muy bueno.
Currently I use bitcoin only to get discounts or have security on the net. But with coinforcoffee I get 20% off my starbucks, I use gyft &amp; egifter to rack 3%-6%, take advantage of online deals, etc. 
**Access to new services**
OpenBazaar, Counterparty, Changetip, Storj Crowdsale, etc are all opportunities that I would have never toyed with if i didn't have the bitcoin to do so. Bitcoin is about to get a whole lot more utility not available through fiat. 
**This is how I see bitcoin currently through experience and use**

I personally don't own doge (I've been generously tipped $1 amounts or so here and there), but I find it funny and useful
Sorry to see the downvotes on ya man, I'm sure doge has bridged the gap for a lot of individuals to become interested and engaged in crypto. Plus when doge individuals cash out they do so by buying BTC so that's alright in my books haha
*(btdubs bitcoiners: it's okay, doge doesn't compete with BTC because it's inflationary by design. It's a unique experiment that helps us find more about human behavior and economics through the contrasts and similarities. Very cool indeed :)*
@_date: 2014-04-27 03:43:42
I would argue that Bitcoin solves the absolute minimum amount needed to maintain the network with ASIC. This is how bitcoiners can have such significantly lower total fee per transaction compared to credit.
And our argument completely swings in my favor the second this transaction moves outside the United States, and especially more so once it changes different currencies. At which points the transaction fee multiplies with the actors involved. 
I would still argue though that the money is changing hands to the wrong people. Because of my previous statement, benefits means so much money is going into fringe and marginal benefits at the expense of increasing the cost of doing business across the country unnecessarily. These benefits are not free and subsidizing always have unintended consequences.
I disagree with your holding method if those individuals intend to spend that money later. I think that's a destructive narrative that saving money in safes is bad. It enables people to make purchases or save themselves from emergencies later when the time calls. Because time is a continuum, there will always be savers needing to cash out. 
I'm not sure about this argument, I could be wrong on this one, but if you destroy $100 then you make everyone else's money a little bit more valuable right? Or is that not how it works with inflationary economies? 
*PS: I just sent you a small tip using a tool built by a small developer on the web, where is your superior dollar equivalent?"*
@_date: 2015-05-24 10:26:49


Yes it does. When you don't spend your bitcoin then the merchants who decided to accept it will realize that no one is using it and then stop accepting it. When merchant adoption decays, there becomes less and less you can do with it which disincentives other bitcoin startups from wanting to create solutions for a stingy bitcoin community. 
If no one is using bitcoin and is just holding it under their bum for the great moon landing: we will never get there. 
Bitcoin is still an experiment, it's not a decided long-term store of wealth. It needs people to use it and experiment with it to allow startups to have customers who would use their services and for businesses to actually see a reduction in costs by accepting it.

It's a bummer for some users who use coinbase as an exchange but honestly I'm glad to see they are protecting themselves for future growth. 
They are an incredibly important company that provide Bitcoin liquidity to those who do not wish to deal with the exchanges. I'm glad they are going about their changes in a transparent manner and I hope the community understand the reasons they are protecting themselves.
Perhaps 2014 will provide competitors that can risk rivaling these limits; but right now I'd rather coinbase play the rules and ensure their longevity. I've been an extremely happy customer so far and I personally don't think these new rules are stifling.

I completely agree with this. While I always support better security measures; paper wallets and second computers are just flat out not feasible for the masses.
We need to take advantage of "m of n" transactions and other clever innovations to give users a bit more security on less secure machines. It's a shame that the community hasn't come up with more streamlined and user friendly processes.
It scares me a bit that we're accellerating the adoption phase without innovation in these steps. Trezor is coming out but expensive and Piper  is expensive as well. 
Let's hope 2014 brings together some smart individuals who value security and ease of use.

With Android's OS becoming more and more user friendly without costing OS integration; would there be incentive to move towards Android development? iPhone is no longer "the pretty phone" 
And not just wallet applications; but other apps and scripts would be incredibly useful. 
Example: Does there exist a way to make IAP with bitcoin? If not is there a way to develop a script or app to help bridge that gap? Surely Android's developer friendly platform would not stifle this innovation; and sideloading is done all the time anyways even if it isn't.
Honestly if Apple want's to stifle innovation; then I think developers should want to move towards more friendly systems. But I'm not invested in the different coding languages and design styles so I'm unaware of the difficulties that would present.

The unfortunate part about cloud mining is that you have to trust operators to use the equipment as you instruct them. 
Yet I still agree with you that making it userfriendly would be infinitely more successful at combatting Ghash then my post. I saw FastHash was aiming at doing something similar to this, where you mail them your equipment and instruct them where to mine. 
If cloud mining can transparently display their operations to be check on 24/7, it would be great to have a company host the mining and allow individuals to point towards p2pools.

The bitcoin cryptography uses the most secure hashing algorithms. What your referring to is the NSA encouraging companies to use weak encryption on their software and data storage.

I don't understand what you mean by saying bitcoin is hard to come by. I use coinbase and **can very easily accredit my account** with coin. I can buy and sell and it comes straight out of my bank account. On top of this, I have a small reserve so I can make purchases instantly (I'm ignoring the fact that coinbase has instant purchase, which they do). 
And your simplifying the hassle of getting your credit card stolen. I've been fortunate enough to not have that happen, yet my parents had this happen and only were able to receive a portion of the money they lost. On top of that it was a pain in the ass for them to get their accounts straightened out and explain the reason for their cards being maxed out. Because of this, they no longer use their credit cards for most purchases unless absolutely necessary and pay fees for paypal and other services to protect themselves. So it has already curbed their spending behaviors and they are now so paranoid that they pay a service to make these transactions for them. **They are paying for security when bitcoin offers it for free.**
Not only that, but it happened from simply using their credit card with a restaurant while traveling and an unsavory character decided to take advantage of the situation. **Credit Cards rely on honesty and trust. Bitcoins do not.**
I agree that bitcoin wallet security is something that **should definitely be expanded upon and made simpler.** 
Yet that is separate from making transactions with bitcoin. Let's say you only bought bitcoin for online purchases (as in to be used almost immediately). If a company could provide that service then it would be infinitely better then credit cards (**cough** coinbase **cough**). Thus it is incredibly more convenient (along with a peace of mind) to buy online goods with bitcoin where you don't know where your information is being stored or where. It gives the consumer that power of security that is **impossible** with credit cards.
As for benefits; bah, those are the incentives to keep using an insecure system. Your paying for this because merchants have fees to accept credit cards and account that into their price. The benefits you receive are only to keep you using an insecure system that they refuse to innovate upon. They are more content making money off of being a central problem solver then creating a risk-free system. 
Also individuals who hold bitcoin should not think of it the same way as cash. When I buy bitcoin, I buy in small portions over intervals. And thus when I want to buy something, it has accumulated a small rise in buying power and then I use that to purchase goods.

Lol yes, the myths that Google plus is a ghost town is just representative of people not using it.
If I made a twitter account and didn't follow anyone or engage in trending discussions then I would think its a damn boring place too. People often make Google plus accounts and go "now what" instead of doing what they normally do on social networks.
The interface is much more sleek and curated towards finding similar discussions. The "circle" method of separating people based on your own categories is genius and through it I post way more material and links then if I had to share my content with ALL my "friends".
If you use android then it is an even more seem less experience as all my photos are uploaded privately from my phone and tablet. Then from my computer without plugging in my phone I can choose which photos to share.

I was wondering the same things, from my experience it seems like Mycelium deletes the keys immediately, and it spends by using the initial address as the change address. Thus there is less anonymity through obscurity yet it makes it easy to spend partial amounts from your paper wallet. 
Still, if you use your phone to decrypt and spend from a wallet; consider it as a warm wallet which has slightly better security than your phone yet not nearly as secure as a wallet generated offline. 
I would love for someone with more knowledge and concise answers though.

this is a false premise.
The money fraudulently charged isn't because a vendor I bought an item for didn't send something, it's because somehow someone somewhere got the number on my card.
If I use my credit card I have to hope every person who handles it will not take a picture and send it to a friend for 5$. And even if everyone handling it is honest, they have to use secure systems that can't be easily breached.

Hey there! The community has seen rare instances with multibit losing wallets. The developer is working on the next version of multibit to fix this issue. 
**Here's how to make a moderately secure backup** by simply copying 12 random words on paper:
* download Ubuntu (or tails or other distro) and make a Live-OS CD
*  boot up computer using the CD: download electrum *(optional: download an open source encryption program)*
*  in electrum generate a wallet. You will be given a 12 word seed and a master public address.
* copy the seed manually on paper *(or in an encrypted text file)* and copy the master public address electronically.
Shut down everything and make backups. If you went with the encrypted text file, you can store that on cloud storage like Dropbox without worry. Just don't forget the password you used to encrypt the text file! 
Test this before sending large amounts: but you can recover the amounts sent to this public master address by doing the same thing except you enter the seed instead of generate.

Honestly though, the core principles of bitcoin and it's use really cannot be confined to a single ideology.
Bitcoin is a technology used by anyone indiscriminately; whether that be drug lords or politicians. Thankfully no one can control this but it's also a fact of life that cannot be ignored.
When/If bitcoin reaches mainstream adoption, it will do so under a variety of flags and different political views. No single preference can win because it's impossible to limit it's use under specific guidelines (as it's charm).
Hackers and developers will create solutions to mitigate tracking and increase anonymity and businesses and government will aim to legitimize by illuminating bitcoin's ledger with tags, labels, and other tracking features for statistics and government control. 
**What is your frog poking point forest**
Robo can do what it wishes. If it's methods are too tiresome and annoying, then competitors such as [lamassu]( and [BitXatm]( have an open attempt at stealing frustrated customers. The best methods will be profitable services (or sustainable decentralized services) that offer customers the best bitcoin service with least hassle. 
If it's a waste of effort then the financial waste lays on Robocoin, yet their promotion and advertisements are definitely a net gain for bitcoin (bad press is better then no press).

Oh come on now, if this is considered spam then at least the people being bothered are being paid for it.
Bitcoin lets people tip very easily over the internet. Thus for funny or good comments it's very easy and fun to send over a small amount. I usually tip around 500 bits which equals 20¢ for content that I enjoy reading.
And I never just tip, I always try to leave a constructive comment detailing why I enjoyed what I'm tipping.

I think it mostly has to do with the way the US gov distributes money. Unlike Europe; Americans don't have great public transport, crappy healthcare, our roads and bridges need maintenance, education is crap and still puts people in debt...
America is really shit at showing taxes are being used to better the public standard of life. Thus when people see the tax on their bills without feeling the effects of it -- its pretty annoying. 
Even with Obama in office and the conservatives saying we live in a liberal wonderland -- we still have mostly the same way of doing things.

I think this entire thread is an excellent discussion; thank you guys for bringing out multiple points from both sides!
I think +is onto something when he states that bitcoin serves no use if you are unable to access services from your location. Sure bitcoin is used elsewhere freely, but for a majority of chinese that doesn't mean much to them.
Yet at the same time, assuming Globalization affects China just as much as the rest of the world... then the attraction of a currency that extends to that is lucrative.
Yet the second draw would have to be incredible to overcome the first. As even if there are employment opportunities abroad, because they can't spend the currency in their country; they would have to work up savings to leave. Which is quite a commitment and is a natural deterrent.
**honestly though**
I'm so bored of seeing China in the news. I mean I understand the massive volume of Chinese investors rose us from 266. Yet at the same time there is an absolutely incredible amount of investment money and infrastructure being built by various countries around the world. Larger payment networks like Square (and less popularly, Stripe) now allow merchants to accept bitcoin without added hassle, ATMs are not only available but we are already critiquing their design and use, wallet security is becoming more secure and [accessible]( the term "bitcoin" in general is already becoming familiar in the public lexicon (remind you it began as a white paper on a small frequented forum board).
The leagues we have come since it's creation is amazing when you step back from the daily happenings. 
Perhaps the Chinese simply created an imaginary price tower and we are returning back to our original growth chart due to bitcoin's natural tendencies. 
I dunno, but I'm done talking about China, I feel like the country will consistently be in this legal gray area. I don't know why individuals are surprised doubt and uncertainty come from a country that is known for doing policy, economics, and politics behind closed doors with networking Chinese elites.

Does the Red Cross give out details of everything they have done, how about Susan B Anthony? 
The point is that while it would be great if everything was done transparently and in the open, it's not exactly an easy thing to do. It requires strict procedures for recording, tracking, and publishing data which is a chore of it's own ontop of every day operations. 
Sean's Outpost runs at a loss in order to keep providing food and shelter. The organization is dedicated to it's mission and composed of good people volunteering/working for minimal payments in order to keep it running. The goal of Sean's Outpost is well accomplished and the amount they do is well recorded, yet this entire thread ignores that and focuses on something they haven't implemented yet? This isn't to say that it couldn't adopt more open book accounting in the future, yet just because they don't do that now doesn't make them a scam.
Who knows though, perhaps Jason see the demand for open books and respond to that. Yet that's a project on it's own and isn't as easy to implement as you think, thus I'm just trying to add some realism to this.

Minecraft is a sandbox creative world. I think the diverse amount of possibilities, creations, and resources mean the game could easily incorporate a small EVE like economy within the server.
My idea for incorporating dark wallet would be to create a fork of the dark wallet app in order to make a more specific Minecraft client. Ideally it would be great if Minecraft server admins could easily add support for a plugin for this client. That way Minecraft servers could offer bitcoin worlds without worrying about hackers (because the server itself won't hold any funds due to multi sig)
So for example. In Minecraft I want some diamonds so I head over to a nearby auction house and browse. I select a stack and then a prompt from my local bitcoin client asks if I wish to send the transaction (either from my phone, in game, or separate app). I click okay and he transaction meets its multi-sig requirements and is sent using a nTimeLock (this way malicious spends can be caught and reversed).
I'm sure someone with better coding knowledge could explain or think of a better way but these are just some thoughts I've had. I want it to be easy for server admins to use bitcoin on their servers for player to player trading

Luckily I hang out with enough bitcoin people IRL and via networks that isn't my only way to discuss the topic. Because if so I might have been in the same boat, but when interacting with people who don't visit but still into the tech, you can see the dramatic difference between the community and those who are building apps &amp; solutions. 
Reguardless, you are absolutely right. It's really fucking frustrating that individuals here think that this experiment will make them super rich without them doing ANYTHING to progress the technology. They don't get that for this "alternative" economy to work, there needs to actually be transactions and people using the software. 
This isn't gold which has thousands of proven worth, it's a new technology that first needs to be tested extensively and used in a variety of situations for people to recognize it's value. New startups need customers, retailers need customers, individuals need to use services and spend bitcoin. "Hodling" goes counter to all these things that need to happen. 


Absolutely. People seem to forget how TERRIBLE the last price rise really was. It was incredibly unnerving to have exchanges a full $100 or more dollars behind MtGox. This caused all the exchange prices to rise but it was based on such a unstable situation. 
People need to stop thinking that bitcoin is bound to hit $1000 and act as if it steadily crept up from the $30 to the now $240ish *(and ignore the MtGox spike)*. If you look at bitcoin like that, it definitely seems positive small growth but much more needs to be done before this technology is solving real world problems. 
Until then, if all you do is hold your bitcoin and share bitcoin memes: you are doing it wrong.

In FinTech? And in a way where all the services in the ecosystem work seamlessly with one-another? I don't think so. But feel free to give me examples where I'm wrong. 
But even with companies that spend a lot of money on their services: Google Wallet, Paypal, Venmo, Square, Transferwise, etc there exists competition to dominate the market and you can't use these apps with another. If you want to transfer money you have to be on the same service. 
Yet let's look at hedged bitcoin services: Coinbase, Circle, Bitreserve, Coinapult, &amp; Coinjar. All of these services allow you to hedge your bitcoin in a variety of stable currencies yet only allow spends as bitcoin. 
Because of this, you can send dollars from one hedged account on Coinjar to a hedged account on Bitreserve. It doesn't matter where you are in the world or if the end-user has a bank account. 
That's an obstacle that bitcoin is overcoming. 


That's an oversimplification. Is bitcoin an experiment? Yes. But it is definitely making strides in the right direction. 
The anti-sybil attack and persistant ledger is more valuable than just currency. Colored Coins, Factom/Embeding information &amp; contracts into the blockchain, Smartcontracts with decentralized oracles *(augur)*, all depend on this ledger to function as it does. It's not an invaluable solution and tons of people are using this feature of a scarce internet token to try and solve problems before that were unsolvable. 
Bitcoin adds a new feature to the internet that was never present before, a scarce digital piece of information. That alone isn't solving a problem but it's a tool for those who are trying to configure solution using this new property.

GHash/CEX also states that they do not wish to engage in a 51% attack or commit double-spends.
**This is a direct contradiction from when the community caught them engaging in double spends to cheat gambling sites**.
Everything said by GHash so far has been incredibly wishy washy. No concrete plans, zero actual engagement (users point out the GHash has been the lone wolf who doesn't participate in pool operator discussions), and zero actual concern for the community. 
If I were a miner looking at companies, I'd see GHash's statements just the same as MTGox. It's easy to say your a good company; yet they have yet to show it.

I agree, I have no problem OSes taking the best features and styling it their own way. I'm just saying it's very unimpressive to see the newest cutting edge features make it to iPhones with an aesthetic flair. 


I'm not saying certain implementations aren't well done, but it's not like they were broken before hand. Android's workflow and features are utilities I use every day, I'm never hindered by a lacking implementation detail. Thus I don't consider their implementations that innovative considering they are simply doing it a different way rather then fixing a broken implementation. 


So aesthetic implementations are great, and the lag of certain features due to waiting for implementation aren't a big deal? I consider the lack of synchronization between my phone apps to be much more then "annoying" and is how I intuitively discover new ways to use my phone. 


Doesn't android have the copy to clipboard command from the share action? I don't remember having problems with images in that situation before but I could be wrong.


Exactly, this is baloney. It's acting like Android isn't a "good" implementation when Android is a very versatile and flexible system that's very intuitive after brief use. It's fine if iOS comes up with cool implementations too, but its claim to be the first "best" one is just setting up a false context.
**/fanboy off**
I really don't care what phone you use though, you seem to be very educated about iOS and like what it offers. Yet as an android and bitcoiner, it's frustrating to see so many people restricted by Apple to engage seamlessly within the bitcoin ecosystem. It dampens security and disfranchises people just trying it out. The recent iOS 8 reveal prompted my android love to come out on top of this. My apologies

Before we start talking about driving the price, let's first talk about making bitcoin a technology that is useful. For that to happen, we need developers to make apps and services that use bitcoin. The incentive to build these apps (whether or not they create a service that drives up the price) is whether or not people use these apps. 
In the case of bitpay/coinbase, even if they don't create a price drive, they definitely create utility for the bitcoin network.
As an example:
* Coinapult/Circle/Bitreserve/Coinjar lets the user hedge their bitcoin as stable currencies. Yet only allows bitcoin deposits/sends
* A user can then spend their bitcoin at merchants/BTMs/bitcoin services 
If there were no merchants, then there would be no reason to hedge your bitcoin. Yet once there are more and more places to spend and use bitcoin, it makes more sense to increase bitcoin apps for consumer stability and then further for consumer use.

You can have services off blockchain because they will be forced to provide only value added services or they won't be used. The lower maintenance of crap to currencies makes these solutions infinitely better from the get go.
Also you can still have a company subsidize the transaction cost with a bunch of spends to reduce transaction fees.
Also the dispersement of bitcoin may not be as distributed as USD because its only been around for 5 years. But what matters is the control of this currency. That is the significant egalitarian part. You don't need to ask permission to use the system. That's the part that matters.
As for the scarcity, deflationary, and general algorithm of bitcoin -- as I said before, your free to use the benefits of blockchain technology to put into place any "perfect" algorithm into play. You don't even need to be a coder.
And there is a difference from bringing up critiques and being an asshole. There are people behind these usernames and you are responding to various random comments with the most sarcastic and mean responses that come out of no where.

This is flat out wrong. Your right that it's hard for consumers to secure bitcoin properly but you can **absolutely secure your bitcoins**. 
The correct statement would be "it's very challenging to properly secure your bitcoin wallets". Yet if you know how it gives you leagues more security then any government or bank. Governments and Organizations can fall, math will not.
Luckily the developers of the world are allowed to come up with interesting security solutions instead of relying on a single organization to innovate. 


I'm right there with you, it would be fantastic to have reliable secure storage services with insurance. But in your desire your ignoring what is already possible to the right people (meaning it will only get easier for everyone else over time). 


Or an app on your phone meaning you don't need to carry any cards


Woop woop, it's a beautiful thing. But your also forgetting that the magic includes it's platform that is open for the world to innovate upon. Because of that we will see finance solutions in the same speed that we saw communication solutions due to the internet. And that it's a much more secure way to shop online, not having to give out your secure credentials.
I actually use snapcard to make a lot of my purchases online (I seek bitcoin merchants first) so that I don't have to give out my credit card information to some random site.

Well with Bitreserve and Coinapult on the scene, we just need the integrations within other bitcoin services to provide the option to use bitcoin without volatility.
*Imagine: various bitcoin wallets that have plugins for coinapult/Bitreserve to lock small amounts of bitcoin directly from your favorite wallet.
Sure this means no gains if there is a price jump, but makes it practical for planning
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:29:46
Ignoring the famewar that comes with Ryan's past: these type of hedged account services are going to bring bitcoin to the mainstream. By letting people opt-out of volatility, but still use the transaction network, it will actually be useful to the unbanked to maintain and send money. 
Plus if these services have API, it lets other developers create bitcoin apps that can be more easily used in the real world as stable currency. 
This stuff is great!
@_date: 2015-01-28 14:03:15
Theres a huge obstacle for this:
**How do you get merchants setting up a decentralized technology to sign-up for a centralized "find-me" service?**.
Currently it seems like OpenStreetMaps with "payment:bitcoin=yes" seems to be the best option. Yet a huge caveat is that many merchants who might set bitcoin acceptance initially drop out later on when they run into difficulties.
While merchant adoption is rising, many merchants drop bitcoin support when they run into problems because of low customer demand for it and they didn't want to spend much money on it in the first place.

So let's step back. Bitcoin is 3 things.
*  a transaction network
*  a store of value
*  a currency
Currently Bitcoin makes an incredible transaction network that continually sees new use through being the core to a bunch of connected services *(Storj, counterparty, factom smart contracts, open bazaar, multi-sig accounting, etc).*
It's currency state is more usable to buy things *(even if through gateways like bitpay and brawker)* than a large amount of world currencies. Plus it works the same way everywhere online and offline, that's a unique feature.
It's store of value is still being decided on. Yet you can choose to use bitcoin as a transaction network and a currency without using it as a store of value by using locking services like coinapult or bitreserve. They completely eliminate volatility if you want that.
Bitcoin is an experiment with huge payoffs if successful. Developments in Bitcoin would have benefits for finance across the world, not just in select geographical areas. It enables people to use the internet and collaborate in a way that wasn't fully possible before. Plus the speed at which this grows already outpaces the traditional system by a landslide in terms of security, transparency, and accessibility.
This is why it's valuable to have people take that leap into bitcoin and test things out. Tinker, see what works and what needs to be built. The more people taking this leap, the more success bitcoin companies will see and can expand.

I'm a bit confused with what you mean by this: 
So you can donate 10^K bits *(10 mBTC)* as the minimum? Or less?
If there is a minimum threshold, would there be methods to allow these transactions to pool up until they reach a threshold? Coinbox.me is popular amongst faucets for achieving this, could one be setup for pools? Perhaps you could use this sort of solution to allow miners to receive dust payments that add up, or allow donators to donate any amount. Or am I misunderstanding the issue.

For individuals in developing countries, land ownership corruption is a huge factor in limiting economic growth. When people can have land and property swept from under their feet, without documentation to fight abuse, then they don't create long-term businesses and institutions.

Ah, so your saying the more options you add, it makes it less user friendly for users who wish to donate from a specific gateway?
I can see this being a challenge to make all the options user friendly with the typical Wikipedia formatting.
I guarantee though that if you accept bitcoin, you'll continue to get donations from around the world, and you only have to pay fees on cashing out to USD on your end (which is significantly cheaper then traditional CC and payment gateway fees). 
Plus when advertising to the bitcoin community directly, you can simply add a bitcoin QR code to the advertisement or campaign and people can donate from the second they see your banner.
So much possibilities!

I don't trust them with my life savings, but they serve a useful function for holding bitcoin at a certain value for x amount of time. Whether it's paying rent, saving up for some groceries, etc: it's useful to be able to lock a certain value for a certain amount of time. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 00:12:47
I've kept a keen eye on NuBits and bitUSD as projects trying to decentralize solving the volatility problem.
I'm a big fan of coinapult and Bitreserve for their user friendly locking tools. Yet it's cool to see projects that would let you instead trade for a decentralized token versus trusting a single entity.
For example: if nubits or bitusd was perfect, I could collect rent, exchange to bitUSD to hold value, and then convert back to bitcoin in order to pay.
Still clunky but will be awesome once the kinks are worked out.

Creating a vertical business is no cake-walk, just because you succeed at one business doesn't mean you'll excel in a different environment. There is a reason that it's not the norm for businesses to create vertical industries versus finding partners and focus on specializing.

Coinbase has a much different gameplan than bitpay. They also manage wallet software which they have incentive for their members to use. 
Bitpay doesn't want to focus on the security of wallets or exchanges, they have a really efficient setup with low-overhead because they have become really good at aggregating the market. Their Best Bitcoin Bid system allows the payee to get the best price for their bitcoin, making a win-win for customer &amp; merchant. This is the direction Bitpay wants to go, software &amp; aggregation of existing services. 
They also support self-management of wallets, considering their open-sourced wallet &amp; dev projects.

The 2008 crisis was in part to mishandling of investment in the housing sector. No one knew who held what assets, they we're being traded when other people believed they owned them, no one knew the whole situation.
If we used crypto-tokens/smart-contracts/coloredcoins to represent assets to be traded on a publically audited exchange; perhaps the problem would have never manifested with so much information transparently available dynamically.
Bitcoin isn't the answer. But a new standard of transparency, global inclusiveness, security, and unbarred peer-to-peer interaction is gaining. Whether or not bitcoin takes this cake is irrelevant, it's simply the current tool that let's people logistically put these aspirations into actual solutions.

With the nearly infinite amount of stories of bad cops not getting fired, or getting smaller sentences for crimes they commit: **it puts the entire system in doubt.**
The crew over at is fantastic in letting anyone make comments rather than creating a closed sub. Yet at the same time, the general culture is a little bit scary in terms of the constant schism of "us vs them".
We need a complete overhaul of how the police thinks of themselves. The same fear that lead to the Patriot Act is also militarizing our police forces and encouraging impulsive behavior rather than deescalation.

I think you bring up some good points in creating a special crypto for the game. 
When I bring up bitcoin in game economies with my gamer friends, they reel in terror. 


*I have a caveat for that*
* Players that buy-in are simply paying the existing players
* Players spending money would bump up prices in the game economy, which non-payers are already harvesting for free.
* You could take money out of the game, and buy a coffee with it *(thus adding real life money sinks, as opposed to vendors in WOW
Yet I see the points they make, and perhaps a custom crypto that's pegged to bitcoin (or perhaps float), in order to have special integration with the game. Plus perhaps add in some centralization so that consensus from the moderation team can handle game exploits/mischief.

There is also a non-zero chance that you mine a block with your devices, thus you should always run mining software from your laptop and phone. /s

Ah gotcha my apologies. If you had bitcoin then setting up changetip would be rather simple :P
There are a few different options for getting bitcoin, and it changes depending on where you live. This mostly has to do with the fact that you can reverse a credit card payment but not a bitcoin transaction. Thus people selling bitcoin have to use measures to ensure people don't scam them.
Coinbase &amp; Circle are the easiest. But some options for getting around Coinbase/Circle would be to buy things for people off amazon and get bitcoin in exchange (brawker.com) or look at LocalBitcoin and find people in the area who want to trade.

I think this site is fundamentally broken. Bitcoin shouldn't be used to create pay-gates all over the internet. Having a paywall prevents content from becoming viral. 
On average, every view that triggers an ad makes the content writer about 1/10th of a cent per view. This is why I think tipping is a much better function to encourage versus pay-walls. Amounts would be larger through being voluntary and thus not charge everyone high amounts.

The LibertyReserve was created in Costa Rica to allow anyone to trade Dollars, Euro, &amp; Gold faster, cheaper, and more securely than banks and other institutions. Because of this, the service was popular with global travelers and FOREX traders alike. 
In 2013, the US Government shut down the LibertyReserve for unknowingly allowing $6 billion laundered through their network. The US Government went to Costa Rica and shut down the company, arrested the CEO and employees, and all their assets were seized. 
[**Now check out this article**](
Fucking *one month* after LibertyReserve was shut down for $6 billion laundered,


 . . .


**HSBC laundered $670 Billion directly to latin American drug cartels and towards designated "terrorist" areas.**
*what was their punishment?*


**HSBC's punishment was 1.9 billion. That's 0.29% of the amount they laundered towards illegal sex, gun, and drug cartels.**
*TL;DR? So far AML/KYC laws have failed to prevent significant money laundering and instead prevented and shut down companies receiving popularity for making online commerce better.*

Everything you said is actually true except for trezors. Developing countries have access to technology but less *(or more difficult)* access to institutions.

The MTG community has so much to gain by turning towards Bitcoin. Because cards can shipped quickly and cheaply, it's a no brainer to use Bitcoin and is now providing a streamline service that encourages this ecosystem. If you play MTG and need some cards, please try looking through his collection to see if he has what you need. You'll be directly encouraging a new community for bitcoin to expand into.
Maybe eventually individuals can make exact trades in real life with their phones using bitcoin as opposed to trading cards at unequal exchange values.

In these situations its best for the dev to be behind something huge: in this case building a pool structure to decentralize mining. 
From this, if successful, he would gain **SIGNIFICANT reputation**. Sure he may not make a ton off p2pool, but forest said he is a student. In this case, he has the benefit of not having to pay for "life" yet while getting the opportunity to immerse himself in his studies and projects. 
Once he wants to start earning money, I'm sure many bitcoin companies would be more then interested in hiring "the dev of p2pool"
This is the significant step of open source programs. The software is free, and you make money off the repuatation gained from being behind it.

I think your issue was rather strange and not the norm. Usually transactions in the mempool will be accepted by coinbase almost instantly. The second it's seen on the network, the transaction is usually accepted even with 0-confirmations. 
You don't really need to cover the cost to make it go faster. This seems like a strange fluke that coinbase should address for their PoS systems. Sorry you ran into it!

The ledger is copied on carious various peoples computers and the only way to make nonreversible transactions is to have someone across the world mine the transaction.

@_date: 2015-05-24 20:35:16


Let's look closer


I love bitcoin but to call it a credible store-of-value is absolutely false. How can something that is only 6 years old, not even on v1.0 yet, and has huge problems to solve in terms of scalability and incentives for when mining subsidy decreases... be considered a stable longterm store of value?
Sure, the basics of what bitcoin is trying to achieve (being predictable and more transparent than most other systems) is great, but that doesn't make the technology in it's current state a great store of value. 
I'm blown away you seriously think that bitcoin would become worth greater than $1000 if everyone did what you did: never use the technology for purchases nor engage with new services or apps that use bitcoin.
How is that going to make bitcoin bigger than actually having people use the technology as a replacement for the existing financial system? Even if it's a clunky way of doing things, this technology needs geeks/nerds/enthusiasts to pay extra money then usual and tinker to make it work. Just like back when the internet was new and people spent a huge amount of money on their dial-up phone bill to let people connect to their BBS.

Gorilla, you guys are truly awesome. I tried out quickcoin but was not impressed; it was all done via private pm meaning no one but the receiver knew about it. And it gave a generic "quickcoin" message that didn't give the impression it was an amount of money being sent. 
I did enjoy the easy-ness that quickcoin gives regular facebook users to setup a wallet. I feel like it will be easy for people to setup decent facebook security and then add 2FA to have an easy facebook friendly wallet. 
Yet I did not like quickcoin as a means to tip small amounts publically. I'm excited to see changetip add that feature :)

Ah okay, well I would easily say that if an individual with a US bank account wishes to buy bitcoins; the simplest and easy option would be to use coinbase.
Not only do they offer a web wallet with 2FA security but they make buying and selling bitcoin (at market price essentially) as simple as a button that interacts directly with your bank account. 
It's much more consumer friendly and based towards individuals looking to get into bitcoin for the payment network rather then to day trade.
Nothing against Bitstamp; they are a reputable exchange. But if someone is very new to bitcoin; I think it would be best to direct them towards businesses more suited for their needs.

Are you kidding me? What's the value in a ledger system that lets an ecosystem of FinTech apps seamlessly work together are compatible despite borders? How is that just a circular bitcoin problem/solution? Currently most FinTech products use USD yet all these USD services are completely isolated from one another. Maybe it's not a problem, but it's a situation that could be dramatically improved to make it easier for newcomers to create a service. 
*Btw, you never gave me an example of global FinTech services that pop up everyday without bitcoin to answer your statement: "New apps and services pop up on a daily basis just fine without Bitcoin." I could be wrong but it sounds like your just saying that to say that without realizing that it's not quite comparable.*


Creating a global alternative to the banking system that allows individuals to exchange value. With the rising hedging services, bitcoin ATMs, and bitcoin services: it's more and more possible and cheaper for a savvy unbanked individual to exchange value and use the digital economy. 
Bonus point: works across the globe without regard for borders. 
There can be 100 hedging services, 100 bitcoin atm services, 10000 bitcoin applications and it all makes for a richer ecosystem. 
Another example of this is the BTM network:  There doesn't need to be 1 BTM company that goes global, as a network of BTMs created by different people and companies interoperate just fine.
Are there more ATMs than BTMs? Do ATMs work with different banks?Yes of course *(albeit with fees)*, but that's not even the point of what I'm saying. The decentralization of effort is the means of creating infrastructure but the compatibility is the solution because it makes the decentralized approach actually worthwhile. 


That is nothing like ARPANET. That's like the internet. Where any website can link to and use functions (api) from other websites and servers. Each website isn't competing to be the only website that provides everything. Also there didn't exist widespread consumer devices that could utilize ARPANET which is dramatically different from bitcoin services.

why are you fucking surprised? Coinbase is trying to be a legitimate exchange and is incredibly exposed to US regulations and policy. Especially considering many rules aren't made up yet, they have to prove they are working to maintain compliancy so that rules are written in favor of cryptocurrencies. They need to be overly compliant to maintain their service which is very useful in terms of making bitcoin more accessible. 


Stop right there. You used your coinbase account to send funds to an illegal market? Are you fucking stupid? You know what information you gave coinbase, you know what their policies are... why are you blaming them?
I place no blame on coinbase for what they did. If you wanted to engage in these markets then there are countless steps users preform to protect their identities. Just because you didn't buy anthing doesn't make your activity less suspicious to (what I assume) is an automatic filter on Coinbase's side.

Do you know why I'm personally a huge fan of the low price point? Apps, services, and companies must create profitable ventures not based on price increases and actually providing utility. 
I'm getting frustrated with this halving talk because it is so pointless. The halving won't make Bitcoin useful for the average Joe. Next-gen applications and services will. 
Why aren't we creating services with coinapult locking API? Or perhaps the various Blockchain programming API.
Let's be excited about making bitcoin useful, not circle jerk about arbitrary "less supply" when in reality people have plenty of time to price this in.

For sure, but anything dealing with money is going to be like that. You have to clear yourself entering the system so that authorities can have a link to go back to later if they discover fraud. This really doesn't have anything to do with bitcoin, its not like exchange operators care who buys/sells other than to not be sent to jail.
If you guys wanted to avoid these sorts of checks, the bitcoin grey market (local bitcoin and other OTC trading) is where you should look. But be warned, without checks means you pay a premium.

OP... so what your saying is your friend already did the verification for sending Fiat but hasn't done that yet for Bitcoin. That's just the state of affairs with KYC/AML.
If there will be more payments in the future then getting set up on both ends (connect your bank account to a crypto exchange and he does the same) is still the easiest and cheapest process. If it's just a one off payment then I can see it being annoying.

Don't get me wrong, it'd be great to see PayPal used with bitcoin to make it easier for people to buy &amp; sell but this solution doesn't solve why people haven't done this already. 
Even if you have biometric scanners and ID readers, PayPal is notoriously difficult to work with from the merchant perspective since they are more consumer friendly. Also they aren't very friendly with virtual currency transactions.

This isn't new news and this is a quite pathetic attempt at character shamming, in my opinion. I support bigger blocks but these types of posts are quite frustrating to read. All the posts by greg and others have been very technical oriented with extremely good commentary about their positions. 
Even if blocks are raised to 8mb, we STILL need Lightning Networks and Sidechains to actually support a more used bitcoin. To say that a larger blocksize makes these irrelevant is ludicrous and the developers of these solutions wouldn't need to counter larger blocks for these solutions.

Hehe, fair enough. I generally tip new users to show I appreciate your comment rather than have an expectation you'd use it to buy something immediately. For existing users it just adds to their "stash". It's hard to find something to immediately use such small change for for but I'd give some suggestions:
* If you haven't used bitcoin before, you can use the small amount to setup a wallet on your phone and withdraw to it. Provides a real way to play around with what making a wallet is like without needing to spend hours getting setup with an exchange/bitcoin vendor. For iPhones I recommend [Breadwallet]( and for Android [Mycelium]( 
* Create a [BIP38 encrypted paper wallet]( to see what "cold storage" is like. If you are interested in seeing the possibilities of bitcoin, it's quite fun/interesting to see storing digital currency offline on a piece of paper. 
* Make a donation to a charity *(such as [Sean's Outpost]( which provides meals to the homeless community in Pensacola, Florida).* Sending a donation is a nice way to see what sending bitcoin is like. 
* *(I was a stingy bastard and only tipped 1000 bits)* but if you play video games you could get a package from Humble for a $1 Although note, the current bundle with "BANDAI NAMCO" disabled bitcoin payments but you can usually purchase bundles with bitcoin. Making a purchase is a good way to test how it feels to buy something online with bitcoin. 


Circle, Coinbase, and Celery all have various fraud prevention protections built into their services. When you signup they use these processes plus KYC/AML laws to then try to determine how much information they need from an individual to allow a purchase. 
In **my experience** I have been able to do exactly this. I link my bank account and then I'm ready to go.
But I know some people on this sub have run into trouble and needed to provide more information/were denied. This is definitely frustrating but has to do with the reversibility/un-reversibility combo between today's payment systems and bitcoin (plus [KYC]( 
**Do note though, once you are setup and "in the system", it's really easy**. 
After getting myself setup on a few bitcoin vendors/exchanges, I can very easily buy &amp; sell bitcoin without hassle. Since many of my jobs are paid in bitcoin and/or require me to send bitcoin, this makes my life much easier. I'm currently living in Munich and sending money to the states for some of my projects is MUCH MUCH easier through bitcoin since my partners are also setup.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:02:21
I'm surprised you had to give so much information for Coinbase. Are you buying large amounts or under a few hundred dollars to play around with?
[Circle]( and [Celery]( are good competitors for Coinbase. [BitQuick]( is somewhat a competitor to LocalBitcoins and has an advertised purchase time of under 2 hours when starting from nothing (such as sending bank deposit, finding seller, escrow, etc).  
Personally I've only used Coinbase &amp; Circle, but celery and Bitquick have had good reviews on this sub so far. 
Another route (if you wish to dive into this rabbit hole) is to have a small portion of your wage automatically purchase bitcoin. [Bitwage]( lets you have a percentage your monthly income automatically purchase bitcoin for you.
**But you are still right**
Bitcoin is notoriously difficult to get because it's dramatically different from regular payment applications. Literally everything else has reversibility, up to a month even in most processors, which makes it really hard for people to sell a non-reversible currency without running into a high percentage of scammers. 
That's why current bitcoin vendors have such stringent policies. 
Bitcoin ATMs offer great potential yet need to pay for the machinery, maintenance, and handling cash which is why they usually have to charge premiums.
Regardless, feel free to post questions *(and ignore the crazy people on here who post unhelpful replies)*.

More being that if those options were available (with discount) it would also make the other features of bitcoin more nice. For example, with circle you can transfer USD balances without volatility or fees which is useful to people who normally have to transfer money with cash.
Also paying bills and stuff could be done through 3rd party services that let you pay bills and taxes with bitcoin which normally require long walks to ATM and then Walmart for bill paying.

Either get a trezor, a [ledger]( or even both and split your funds. 
You really shouldn't leave that much money on something like your phone. A hardware wallet lets you secure your coins in offline storage relatively easily, while still being easy to access. 
You should really make this a priority. Watch some videos online of the two devices *(I still recommend getting both)*, play with them yourself, and then split up your funds. 
Also I'm assuming you've made the backup of the seed already, but if not do that. 


Phones are simply not meant to have the same security standards as a hardware wallet. Zero-day exploits, a rouge app, a friend who saw you type in the pin, etc are just too much to have on mind with that much money to loose. Whenever you go online you run the risk of installing a keylogger/virus.
**TL;DR: Make getting a hardware wallet top priority. Don't put it off, please!**

I agree. Bitcoin isn't ready for mainstream adoption. 
The way I "envision myself" is like those nerd evanglists who paid tons of phone bills and costs to run BBS boards before AOL. It costed tons of money but it required these nerds to actually use these systems and push the boundaries of the net to create new usecases.
I'm not saying to use bitcoin as an average joe, I'm saying if you wish to support bitcoin, then fucking use it despite it being an economic loss, because by doing so, you support the industry and discover things along the way you didn't know existed. 
For example, I have almost all my money in "blockchain solutions", as in I use a variety of mechanisms to peg/hedge to dollar where I need money to be stable and use a variety of ways to purchase things online and in person using a bitcoin medium (shift debit card, purse, fold, etc). If I simply used credit, I would have never known this "arrangement" existed using all these services to clunkily put together what visa normally does. Yet my hacked collection of services only improves over time and it's modular nature means I can new services as they come out without abandoning the wallets/platforms I use.

That's being greedy. You're taking a risk to make more money after you already made money.
The point is you already made profit, so use that to close your liability. The remaining gains will keep gaining and EVEN if it goes down, you'll still be profitable. Thus, if you cash out 10% to cover your loan, no matter if the price goes up or down, you already win.
Yet if you gamble, and the price goes down, you'll have a huge loss. 
Don't be greedy, if the loan amount is more than you can cover with your fiat earnings, then you are taking a risk on a very volatile market.

The thing is, it's really difficult for a cannabis vendor to accept Bitcoin because all the existing processors won't want them as a customer. With bitpay and coinbase already getting tons of heat from the government to be legit, the last thing they want is to be shut down for helping cannabis sales.
Thus the only way for a cannabis shop to make this work would be to perhaps have an account on Coinapult/Bitreserve to hedge the value of their coin, and then sell it using LBTC (which isn't practical or entirely legit for a business to cash out funds).

I'm not aware of the bitcoin side chain varient, do you have a link? I've only seen the progress of augur.
Question: even if the sidechain project is based on the btc blockchain, people would still most likely exchange for the token over regular exchanges versus through a technical conversion. Thus for the average user, wouldn't the pegged VoteCoin be the same as an Ethereum Coin? People would still buy btc to get the coin either way.

I absolutely agree, but especially in America there is tremendous voting apathy. Younger generations generally find being interested or engaged in politics useless since nothing beneficial comes out of it. 
Look at the recent political stage. Obama rallied massive support from the youth generation and then what did the youth get out it? While some things were tinkered and changed, generally the youth didn't get the types of dramatic policy changes they were expecting. 
Not really trying to lambast obama here, as this would have happened with any politician and makes younger generations really indifferent to the two parties.

Everything your saying is how I view the bitcoin industry maturing. Anyone who thinks the world will pivot to bitcoin payments is crazy, people want to use fiat and if bitcoin is going to work, it has to make fiat easier. 
Currently regular fiat payment services work exclusively within their own service and don't work with one another (whether its services within the same country or internationally). Bitcoin is becoming the liquid way to provide USD services while still working cooperatively with other services. Changetip in the US can offer USD wallets to german users who deposit in bitcoin: this offers flexibility and utility without volatility. 
I'm excited to see bitcoin become less volatile. The merchant adoption occurred because merchants could use bitcoin without volatility risk. It was simply a utilitarian tool to transfer money cheaply to their bank account. 
I think merchant hedging options should do the same. Just because things are priced in USD doesn't mean it is the end of bitcoin as a settlement layer.

Now Bitcoin is more and more considered a troubled currency. Which in my opinion is pretty incredible to see this shift in opinion and context.
Bitcoin still has a long long way to go. It's not recognized or used by many, not very useful in real life, BTMs are just now becoming more available, the small $3b market cap liquidity is scattered across multiple exchanges, etc.

Bitcoin IS the blockchain. It's the reward and token of this ledger system. If you replace it with fiat then you'd need counterparties who say they have the tokens to send on demand... Which as you can imagine defeats the purpose. 
If a bank uses their own blockchain, they'd still need to somehow move their currencies around. And if no one is being rewarded to do so but the bank, it's no different from papal. Bitcoin is the incentive and token to maintain a decentralized ledger which had become known as a blockchain

Because you're not stealing your copying. It's not the same. It doesn't make it totally okay but these producers have the benefit of a medium that can be copied infinitely and spread everywhere with no effort or cost.
This opens the door to new forms of revenue generation. In music you see this with the trap and electro scene by artists releasing free music to gain reputation and draw body crowds to their events, concerts, tours, and merchandize. Which they make so much more money from.
By using their digital work to spread reputation as virally as digital allows, they use the new reality of music distribution instead of trying to force older models of distribution in a new and different environment.
@_date: 2015-09-26 16:46:08
I really really dig this concept, this is such a interesting combination of physical &amp; digital currencies. 
Could this be done with bitcoin? Imagine having this chip use the same technology as [Ledger unplugged](
You could whitelist certain price thresholds to not need a password and it wouldn't need power because it's NFC based. You shouldn't need to trust the device your tapping, set time limits between spends, and use your phone to send out a pin or signature confirmation for larger amounts. 
imagine making a disk like this and then make a marketplace for artists to create cool bracelets, necklaces, and other accessories that utilize this ledger disk.
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:12:00
That is not at all what I'm saying. You can use a high view count on youtube or a high download/stream count to prove your reputation. When you have a good enough reputation you can draw in crowds when you host events and people want to buy your merchandize. This is how artists make the bull of their money. Not off music downloads but by drawing people into events they host.
You can't say this model doesn't work because its how the entire electro genre works and is massively successful at letting new artists rise up and gain popularity enoughto actually play at events without a producer getting them contacts.

I think we need to work on bitcoin hedging options first: until we can make volatility optional, people aren't going to want to test out bitcoin applications. 
People need to be able to easily spend bitcoin as bitcoin without volatility. Whether they use bitreserve, coinapult, or some other service, having the flexibility to optionally use different parts of bitcoin while excluding other parts will give individuals freedom to explore.
@_date: 2015-04-20 05:44:38
Right, let's just ignore the way internet and digital files work and instead of adapt new ways of revenue generation we try to pigeon hole old models of content distribution in a drastically different environment.
The opportunity to copy digital files infinitely and send them anywhere is an incredible new tool. But you can't have this with the same old models of distribution based on a world where you need music producers to make physical records and CDs to get your sound out to your fans.

One method is through crowd-funding autonomous machines that would be run by smart contracts. If you have machines that run themselves *(such as purchase their own fuel, repairs, etc)* then there is no need for a company to be involved with creating and profiting off of them. Thus individuals could crowd-fund the creations of these devices and earn dividends through them. 
Some autonomous machines that could be useful to the public infrastructure would be quadcopters for package deliveries and self-driving cars. 
Here's a good [whitepaper]( that produces a good thought-experiment to make this possible. Not necessarily the way it will play out but a good way to start thinking about it.

Have you heard of escrow? It's a safeguard meant to handle these sorts of p2p transactions. The way it works usually is you involve a 3rd neutral agent and create a multisig wallet with 3 keys and it needs 2 to send. You send your money to the multisig, and then the money cannot move until 2 people are in agreement. Either the buyer and seller together, or either of them after negotiating with the escrow agent.
Granted, the escrow market could use user-friendly tools, yet [bitify]( [bitrated]( or are perhaps some places to start. Honestly, the best way to go about selling is to use dedicated markets. For example, [Skins Bazaar]( lets users exchange CSGO skins for bitcoin through a safe escrow. is the most ideal but also involves a learning curve that you may not be ready to jump into.
Yet this brings up a great point. It would be great to have a neutral escrow market for all things that anyone could tap into. Essentially it would need a market of escrow agents that have reputation they build, and you could pay a fee to them should their services be needed.

What are you talking about? If you couldn't use bitcoin to buy things then why should it have any value at all? 
It won't just "happen". Bitcoin is a complicated subject and the process is much smoother when you show people they can use selective parts of bitcoin without using other parts. In the merchant's case, they might want to use bitcoin as a transaction network but not as a store of value or currency. With BitPay they can make that flexible choice. 
@_date: 2016-10-15 17:30:52
Well, it definitely reveals the raw nature that bitcoin still resides in. A lot of focus has been built on connecting bitcoin to the existing traditional gateways. With shift and purse, it's pretty functional to live day-to-day without issue using bitcoin. 
Yet now that those gateways are user-friendly, it would be great to see focus on this. 
Currently, Paypal/CC is superior for p2p transactions because chargeback is a useful tool to incentivize fair interactions. Yet, it also comes with the cost of using a 3rd party of which you have little leverage over and the system makes it risky for the seller. So now that you remove the chargeback, you now have absolute sends which are useful to build systems with, but we don't have that system yet.
Ideally, the payoff will be that once a system is built on top of absolute sends, it will be fair to both the sender and receiver.

Please be very very careful about the security of your cold storage. While BTC has greater returns than a regular pension, please don't put your grandmother at risk of losing everything in a hack.
Use multisig and don't store seeds online.

Oh right, because building decentralized markets that is secure against Sybil reputation fakes is soooo easy. 
It's volunteers building brand new code that has to be perfect and they are giving it away for free. Plus they never did a crowd sale to raise money and just have a donation link. They even have their own sub and the coders are very active.
I really hate the impatience on this sub.

Its less about storage and more about ease of withdrawal and usage without worrying about compromising your setup.
As a method of keeping it safe for deposits, storing an encrypted BIP38 key on a USB/paper is fine. You just have to have a new wallet for each transaction to maintain security.

That's really really bizzare, I buy things with the bitpay checkout all the time and I personally have never had a problem. Not even a minor lag. 
Yet you shouldn't contact vaporshark about bitpay screwing up, they likely won't know what you are talking about. There are several posts from reddit with bitpay working with the customer to refund screwed up purchases. 
Just open an email to bitpay, link both transactions from the blockchain, and they will very likely resolve/refund your situation. 


Really? Did you wait a day to see if an email came through? That should be a simple call-back option for Vaporshark to integrate and would be the same with CC/Paypal/Whatever.

@_date: 2015-03-26 21:58:48
Jesus dude, my point was comparing using bitcoin for withdraws versus a fiat system, and why it makes a system like changetip possible vs a fiat system. 


Pretty sure bitcoin is used for withdrawals.
You mentioned two countries that are war-torn/sanctioned by the US gov, quite the extreme which also leaves out the 99% of countries in which changetip works just fine.
Also I'd assume that those countries couldn't use reddit/facebook/twitter in those countries for the same reasons, or atleast use TOR/VPNs for their own protection. 
If not, then sorry; I was two countries off of the *entire world.*
@_date: 2015-03-19 09:45:54
Aha, so the context surrounding a transfer. Thanks, that's what I wanted to know. I knew it had to be something more than that.

Woohoo! Decentralization!


Oh no! My 3 bucks on changetip might be stolen!!! Whatever will I do!
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:17:06


I disagree greatly. $3 million is a huge amount of money if you have a plan how to spend it. Running servers are cheap, marketing agendas can be budgeted, and everything including rent + employees are easily predictable.
In that time, changetip hasn't relied solely on reddit + twitter tipping, but have constantly been improving their service, adding new features, and evolving the company. 


All the services I listed earlier spent years gaining marketshare without making a penny. Snapchat JUST RECENTLY introduced snapcash, big events, and news outlets to their mix which likely just started to earn revenue after years of free users. Why is changetip *any* different?


So? Changetip is part of the umbrella company ["Changecoin"]( which has broader goals that includes changetip. 


So they will use publicly available data? If you don't want your accounts connected together, it's trivial to have a seperate changetip account across multiple social media services. Just log out and log in. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:33:47
Lol dude relax, so someone beat them to a new TLD, doesn't make the company incompetent. The product has spanned across a ton of social media services and allows for micro-donations. 
Does this service allow micro-donations below the minerfee? That would be awesome if it did. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:24:08

Sounds great! I'll be sure to give them a shot. Thanks for the tip!
And I definitely recommend Steamjunk's Ghostberry if you can ever get your hands on it. It's what got me into vaping in the first place! If you can remake something similar to that then I'd forever bow before you lol.

Using a prepaid card? Not totally sure but you could try using circle.com.
If that doesn't work, then check out brawker.com which lets you buy people's items for them and they send you the bitcoin.
A competitor to brawker.com is purse.io, both would do the trick. But note: both brawker &amp; purse have a premium price in order to make the service run, so you won't get the market rate but rather some percentage below it. 
If you have further questions, sometimes you get better responses at :)

The device in the pictures is called "mycelium entropy". You plug it into a printer and it can print Bitcoin wallets with good certainty that the device is random enough to make a wallet that has never been generated before.
This is important because you can print the wallets offline very easily with this device, meaning the private key never hit the internet and thus can't be hacked. Usually you have to go through a long process of setting up your computer a special way and disconnected from the internet to do this with the same precautions.
In this thread, the users device looked tampered. This causes suspicion because the whole point is to securely generate wallets to hold your coin. If it was tampered, perhaps there is a possibility that the hardware was altered to generate wallets that have been generated before.
Hope this helps! Thanks for asking, 350 bits @_date: 2015-03-09 06:39:27

Dig into search engines?
I scrolled down to "other ways to give" and saw bitcoin option very clearly in the following page. 
They only have paypal &amp; credit cards on the main page because they don't want people to be overloaded with the payment options. 
Bitcoin is still incredibly tiny compared to these payment networks. The donation attrition from option-overload isn't compensated by the amounts donated by bitcoiners.

Come on, I never said he was wrong nor that anyone should ignore Swag's instructions. I agree that using HD wallets is definitely the way to go. 
Yet I think this community on has a terrible trend of being hostile towards newcomer's and being overly paranoid when the user isn't even asking about that.
The new circle user was making a case of printing a QR code to a pamphlet or other material to collect funds. This is something that works and isn't a terrible thing to do. What, should he instead try to create a master public key that he posts on a pamphlet? That's a bit of overkill and posting a static address for this single purpose isn't going to result in him being hacked.
Should the new user use one address as their main and only wallet? No. But that's not what they were asking about.
I don't think that being helpful or giving the right advice needs to be hostile. This is the reason dogecoin prospered because of reactions like this. I think we can learn from that.
@_date: 2015-10-13 06:03:08
Lol what a ridiculous title. This is amazing. 
Merchants could start using bitcoin because they could exchange to $ without volatility. On ramping new users to crypto or even assisting existing users to use stability to solve other problems (paying a specific amount of money in x days). 
It's useful. 
Plus users of circle can still use all bitcoin services through their wallet.

I think it has a lot to do with lack of merchant support. A merchant can very cheaply (for free) get bitcoin running. Yet the cost of learning how to do this and maintain it is prohibitive for someone not into the technology. 
It's great to have solutions like bitpay/coinbase/etc yet there needs to be individuals who can provide on the ground support. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 06:39:56

I'm not trying to say these problems dont exist, but what your stating also has to do with a bad generator on android that has been fixed. Also if you use a good random generator, it would still require a dedicated quantum computer to crack this.
I'm not saying your wrong, but to look at the context. This is a new bitcoiner who is being introduced by circle. He isn't making his own paper wallets. Thus I'm just suggesting to be less hostile (Swag is writing very rudely in my opinion to someone new to this stuff) and explain the greater context of this versus being negative for not knowing.
That being said, I love using mycelium for their HD wallets but also enjoy BIP38 wallets because you can make a wallet with an easier to remember password. Storing a 12 word sequence can be stolen by simply being seen. It's not the most perfect solution.
@_date: 2015-03-26 19:57:03

What do you mean nothing different? As in not needing to leave a public address after each post you do on everything? I'd call that different.
People aren't leaving large funds on changetip.
And if it's "hard to get it out" then those people would have never taken the bitcoin plunge to start since the only hard part is getting your own bitcoin wallet.
What's hard about clicking withdraw?

*[edit: person I responded to said that tipping doesn't require a middle man and people can just tip each other person to person on social networks. This user wasn't taking into consideration how obnoxious that would look across the internet and what that would require without using a service]*
Sure, so after every social media post that person should leave a long Bitcoin address in case someone might tip them.
Get real dude, changetip works great and there is such minimal risk to the end user. People don't hold $1000s or $100s or even $10s of dollars on the service yet still get tons of benefits through their model.
Not everything centralized is bad, and not everything needs to be decentralized just because its built on a decentralized platform.

amazing, would love to see other juice vendors do the same. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 14:05:55
Bitcoin is still grassroots, I would suggest talking to the merchant and explaining this to them and see if they can setup a 0conf solution to avoid messy situations like yours. No one likes waiting, not the merchant or you. 
In regards to fees, almost everyone is with you on that. A small plurality of folk are content with bitcoin purely as a settlement layer (meaning higher fees) instead of a payment rail. Personally I'm against this exclusion because it limits adoption in countries where government-less currency is more highly needed (most of South America, Africa, India). Yet until a scaling solution gains consensus, this is what we have for the time being.
Note: a decentralized settlement network still has tremendous value, so don't lose your enthusiasm. But you're correct that it's drifted from a few years ago when "no fees!" was advertised wildly. Back then it was sort of assumed that scaling would advance quicker then Bitcoin's adoption. Turns out increased adoption makes consensus even more difficult with so much at stake. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 06:33:56
I'm a bit bummed as well. I showed up in Munich not to long ago only to find out the recent machine in the near was taken down :/ 
As for the culture of Germany, there is a strong desire to preserve anonymity in transactions by using cash. Honestly though I think this could be used to bitcoin's advantage. It provides the benefits and ease of being digital yet also the same anonymity of being semi-anonymous. You can top up at a BTM and then make purchases without it creating a list of where you spend money on your card. Especially if you use an HD wallet like breadwallet or mycelium, it would be very difficult to link an individual to their purchase history *(which would meld very well with the German shopping culture)*. 
Yet unfortunately even in Berlin there is only one ATM which I'm not even sure is in operation anymore. The only way you could use a BTM is to travel over to Licht. or Austria nearby :/
Anyone know of upcoming bitcoin ATMs in Germany? Or what a person needs to do in order to get one setup legally by BaFin standards? I know that Sparkasse won't let individuals use exchanges yet Fidor is streamlining operations to make it easy.

@_date: 2015-03-01 17:32:50
Right. Well luckily we have a little bit of time until this problem becomes an issue. By the time quantum computers are able to easily crack Bitcoin addresses, I would expect the bitcoin infrastructure and use of HD/stealth wallets to be much more advanced and user friendly. 
Until then, I think your fears are a bit over stated (not wrong just overblown)
@_date: 2015-03-01 20:37:54


Right. Let's just pass this along to the user who began using bitcoin with circle. He'll know exactly how to use this without any error.
I know that master public keys exist, and I'm well aware of development of stealth addresses. Yet they are not ready for prime-time, nor are they adopted by the industry in mass, nor are they easily useable to new users who aren't even holding their own keys. 
Until then, if the user wants to put a QR code on some printed material so that incoming funds go to his circle account, using one of the QR codes given to him from circle would do the trick. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 06:31:17

The explosion of improved evaping devices (for nic) has allowed for a whole new market of juices to take the field. Unlike traditional big-tobacco, ejuice is really easy to make and allows for a lot of variation: thus lots and lots of small-time sellers who have found their favorite combinations are setting up shop.
Since ejuice sellers are almost always small-time vendors selling through the internet; a non-chargeback-able, no cost, internet currency is a natural fit. Especially when they are using wordpress/magento shop setups which have easy to integrate bitcoin plugins. *(Along with the high margins they pay for a still emerging industry with legal limbo in many areas).*
That'd be my guess.

@_date: 2016-10-15 16:58:05
You're right, it's definitely not as quick. Quick transactions only happen on their dedicated markets which is almost counter to the p2p nature that bitcoin advertises.

So the bitpay option payment went through cleanly, and it just took time for it to show up in your account deposit?

Well more of the fact that you could make it something simple, such as their birthdate. Then you can write "your birthday + full name" under the encrypted private key.

**Every action** done by a mod can be seen by every other mod. If there is even a single smidgen of doubt, it would be immediately visible. 


Lol, hyperbole much. And also inaccurate. Bashco couldn't issue any mod commands that weren't attached to his name and immediately visible to all other mods. 
Considering he does quite a bit of moderation per day (I think he mentioned 80 actions) and the large size of this sub (over 150k subscribers), I'd say they need all the manpower they can get.

I dunno, whenever i play with my paper wallets, Coinbase, circle, and purchasing stuff online in front of friends who use venmo regularly, they are always intrigued.
Yes you can send money, but bitcoin looks and acts much differently (with less limitations). They see quick settlement as I move stuff around and are always amazed. 
That being said, none of them use bitcoin because the volatility isn't for them. Yet with bitreserve and Coinapult and others on the scene, its a matter of time
@_date: 2015-03-29 20:29:52
I use namecheap extensively and have never ran into this problem. I've deposited money to my account while items were in the cart, refreshed page, and bought.
What wallet were you using, is your internet connection solid, etc?
I'm not trying to belittle a pain point, but since I use namecheap *(and other bitpay pos windows often)* and have never had a problem, it makes me curious if the issue is from your end.
Also bitpay support has a good history of helping work things out if you present a clearly broken situation.
@_date: 2015-03-26 17:05:28
**So what. I'm so tired of hearing this line.**
The settlement is what's important. They can let anyone who uses social media tip and withdraw their amounts (without first having a btc wallet BTW). You can't do this with any fiat service because withdraw would be incredibly difficult when you have users across the world.

How is the issue you linked relevant at all to what we are talking about?
The Circle user was asking if he could use a single address to post on a pamphlet, in which others responded to him/her how it's stupid to use single addresses. 
I'm trying to point out that what he was asking is ok, as it's unlikely anyone would be able to crack open his static addressed used on a printed material. And for this purpose, putting a QR code on a printed material, this works. 
Again: It's good for others to know that using HD wallets are good, and I agree with that entirely. Again, I love using mycelium because it does this by default. Individuals shouldn't use a single static-address paper wallet as their main wallet. Nor am I recommending that.
Yet you linked someone accidentally sending money back to the addressed they received from. How is this relevant? He wasn't hacked for using a static-address paper wallet. He was sent coins and then sent them to the wrong address. Plus he wasn't printing materials, he was using a phone wallet *(in which an HD wallet should be used because it can constantly issue new addresses).*
Until we can post a QR code that gives individuals countless individual public keys, a static address is the best way to post QR codes on printed materials (assuming you use different static addresses per use-case).

I remember one year ago I bought honey from some dude on reddit using bitcoin. When I got the package to my house, I was ecstatic and was excited that I could actually buy things with this new-fangled-internet money.
Now it's come to the point where it's functionality is coming closer and closer to the existing financial system. It is beginning to feel less like an "experiment" and more like a serious alternative. 
But because I came from that initial perspective a year ago, it still makes sense that people aren't using bitcoin for purchases. 
Yet with the introduction of locking services like Coinapult &amp; Bitreserve, new users will be able to use selective features of bitcoin *(the transaction network &amp; global settlement)* without using it as a store of value. This same selectiveness is what drew in merchants and which is why I really want there to be more of a push to use these services. 
Plenty of people would benefit from digital cash, yet can't afford the volatility of bitcoin and wish to use it the same way they use paypal. *We shouldn't be excluding these groups of people!* :)

Yet I'm not sure if is the type of work around you'd like to implement. 
Perhaps it might be too much trouble, but another few ideas:
*  Make one-time coupon codes per bitcoin payment. Write the specific one-time coupon code onto the biz card you include with each order that gives x% off next order with BlackForest
*  Perhaps let users tweet a picture of their order towards your twitter and send them some bits via changetip? *(Good PR/Marketing perhaps to get people to tweet at you and create a personal interaction with buyers?)*

Your missing the point. 
The fact being that the infrastructure will **continue** to get easier, more useful, etc. I'n not saying it is at a point for mass adoption yet. And your wrong, special things **did** happen: 
*  multisig
*  hedging in other currencies
*  widespread use of HD wallets
*  coinbase/circle expansion
*  more secure exchanges
*  easy Blockchain API 
... These are all very special and important steps in building a better user experiences and letting more people build on top. *What are you talking about?*
Bitcoin adoption won't happen in a day. And if the entire ecosystem and businesses already existed than Bitcoin wouldn't as amazing an opportunity.

**You are an idiot.**
They have VC money to run changetip *(plus all the associated costs)* for X years. In those X years, they plan to gain X market share and then use that to build up other applications. 
Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat... this isn't a new concept. Launch for free, grab market share, and then offer services or get bought by a larger company who likes what you do. 
If you think that because they aren't making immediate revenue that they are a doomed company, then you probably shouldn't be engaged with startups or you aren't aware how VC works. They sell equity in order to run for X years for free. 


Dude, it's incredibly easy to separate your changetip accounts. Log in to one service *(aka reddit)* to manage that account. Then log out and log in with another service *(ex: twitter, facebook, g+, whatever) and then you have two changetip accounts that aren't linked together. 
They don't have any information that isn't already public.

Merchants (especially coffeeshops with small transactions) should be using 0-confirmation. This means you'd have clearance once the transaction shows up on the network (immediately). 
While you could doublespend that $4 macchiato, you're also probably one of the few bitcoin spenders there and it  would be no different than charging back on your CC except more obvious that it was you.
As for the fees: yeah it sucks. Back in the day, bitcoin's transaction volume was small enough that miners would accept transactions with quite low fees (close to negligible). Now with the price increase and increased transaction volume, a fee market has been created which has bitcoiners basically bidding to have their TX included in the next block. 
That's why scaling debates have raged on for the past 2 years. One camp says we need SegWit and offchain transactions, another says we need bigger blocks.

Dude. They are trying to gain market share. That's the point of VC money, so you can run a service for X amount of time while not making money in order to grab market share and brand recognition. They are likely very very aware of the costs it will take to run the servers, pay employees, and marketing efforts and had that all in their pitch when getting VC. This isn't some scam, its a very very common way many tech companies get a chance (to either become their own or get bought out by a larger company).
Do you think tipping over social media is their only plan? They have an umbrella company that has many more services they plan to launch in the future related to this infrastructure.

Sorry, I didn't mean to come off like its unacceptable to critique bitcoin businesses. Yet I feel like the buttcoin post, *(while began well)* ended up making qualms that are easily solved if looked at seriously. As an example: the OP made a arbitrary assumption that changetip was creating bots to fake enthusiasm for the service, and after another buttcoiner admitted it was his, OP never adjusted the original post to maintain the narrative. There's a difference from being critical, and trying to pidgeon-hole a bunch of statements with an agenda.
But to clarify, I wasn't really annoyed at the buttcoiner, but at other bitcoiners. I'm really tired of the hivemind that attacks all companies that aren't decentralized. That's what pushed me to make that post, in which I was mostly responding to people's critiques for changetip being a centralized service that uses off-chain transactions. 


And what if people prove those ~~allegations~~ assumptions wrong and the OP doesn't change their posts to reflect new information? 
Either way, I appreciate your post to play devils advocate. Your right, it's always good to have critique. Yet in this case I was seeing only critique and no defense so I wanted to add my opinion.

I really dislike people like you. Decentralized solutions are great but it's really fucking annoying seeing people get upset when companies in the bitcoin space are ragged on for simply not being decentralized.
Changetip let's you tip natively on YouTube, G+, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Slack, and a variety of other networks. There is no minimum tip amount and its unbelievably quick.
Not everything has to be decentralized to be a good product. Centralized isn't inherently bad and has benefits to it. Stop clinging to a buzzword for the sake of saying "rah rah decentralize" when there isn't a clear benefit. If changetip starts being bad then people can move to autotip or whatever else. People don't hold life savings or even moderate amounts on changetip anyways. Its different then an exchange or a bank. Its a service with little risk to the end user.
Seriously dude. The people at changetip are working incredibly hard to bring Bitcoin mainstream through grassroots efforts. Give them some credit for constantly making bitcoin more tippable.

This is getting carried away though. **I'm not reccommending using a static address for your regular wallet.**
Yet the new circle user was asking if they could use a static address for making printed materials. Of which, this is a perfectly acceptable use-case for a static-address. 
If you use a phone, you should use an HD wallet since the phone can generate an infinite amount of addresses per invoice. I never said people shouldn't do this, and I personally use HD wallets my self.

Oi. If bitcoin was at the stage the internet is at now, then of course it would be easier to use. The point is that it is early in infancy and that opportunity still exists for people to take.
Scale back the infrastructure of bitcoin 2 years ago and you'd realize the speed of development. And already we have projects in alpha now which will completely disrupt other industries. 
Cloud storage, eBay, prediction markets, decentralized oracles, smart contracts for untamperable machine to machine communications, bitcoin hedged in various currencies, more robust and secured exchanges, etc.

Just recently there was a massive hack [that stole $1 Billion from banks]( does this make you think the banking infrastructure is weak? Probably not. 
If you want to be sure your bitcoins are safe when trading, then use an exchange like Coinbase which has [FDIC insured dollars]( on their system *(same federal insurance that banks use)* or use an exchange which offers multi-sig technology or a history of paying for their mistakes *(like bitstamp)*.
The recent reports of hacked exchanges are not used by the wide-community and were very small and un-reputable exchanges. If you want to be trading thousands of dollars, don't use an exchange that has barely any history or reputation. It's really not that big of a deal and the vast majority of crypto-traders were unaffected by these small-exchanges being hacked.

Here's my humble opinion on all the changetip chatter.


**Yes it fucking does**. The reason changetip is different from a fiat service is because withdraws aren't geo-limited. If you can use social media *(as in, anywhere in the world)*, then you can receive and withdraw tips sent to you. **Without even needing to make a bitcoin wallet in the first place**. 
If a fiat service did this, it would require extensive banking relationships across the world using various different currencies and require users to give much more personal information such as debit card numbers or bank accounts to withdraw. 


Who cares. Not everything in bitcoin needs to be decentralized. Especially when there really isn't a clear advantage to it.
Changetip enables near-instant micro-transactions without any fees. It enables people to receive bitcoin without needing a bitcoin wallet *(letting them look into getting a wallet on their own time)*.
Yet since changetip is built on a decentralized platform, it's incredibly easy for people to move to other services if changetip causes problems or isn't better than the competition. 


It's very easy to isolate your changetip accounts across different social media channels. Personally I keep my reddit changetip account separate from my other social media changetips. Just log out and then log in using the other accounts. Really easy. You don't even need a password if you don't want since it needs your social media auth.


That's right. But I don't think many people are holding more than a few bucks with changetip meaning there is a huge difference between this service and coinbase/circle/exchanges. A few bucks versus thousands of dollars are very different ballparks.


**It's called venture capital people**. They pitch an X year plan to investors which includes the costs to: 
* costs to run the bots that make changetip function
* costs of employees
* costs of marketing plans.
The point of VC money is that you have an idea and functional application that won't make any money until it starts getting market share to offer other services. Changetip is just a single function under their larger [ChangeCoin]( company in which they have much more planned. This isn't a new concept and has worked plenty of times for various other apps/services on the internet. 
If the app made money off the bat, they wouldn't get VC funding at the cost of company equity. That's the fucking point. 


No, I just find all this negativity around a bitcoin company that has been nothing but innovative incredibly annoying. How is any bitcoin startup supposed to take off bitcoiners are so negative and attack them on shallow assumptions. I want the bitcoin ecosystem and infrastructure to grow and I want devs to try making cool things with bitcoin. Yet if everyone goes, *"rah rah, not decentralized! WTF!"* without even having valid arguments, I like to give my opinion why I think they are being ridiculous. 
tl;dr: People who hate on changetip often go for shallow &amp; easily explainable points. *(But what do I know, I'm just a dumb bitcoiner, eh?)*

You know, this is often repeated that people are constantly losing their coins. There are posts every now and then of someone unfortunately getting robbed or lose their private keys. Yet if we were to match this vocal minority with posts from the vast majority that have not lost their coins, it would certainly drown out the noise. 
It takes a bit of youtube watching to learn how to properly store your private keys (and there are multiple ways to do so), but considering the benefits (ease of transfer) and the fact its a token thats worth money, its not undoable.  Bitcoin storage is increasingly becoming turnkey

If you create accounts that own the private keys (without a central server holding the coins) it would reduce the possibility of a hack. Use multi-sig so that the game can initiate transactions yet require the user to use a second device (like a phone) to confirm outgoing transactions. 
Also in this method people think the game would be over-crowded with people just buying everything up. Yet when this happens in the WoW auction house, prices shoot up and the people spending time grinding would benefit from people spending money on resources they got for free.

No, I don't think changetip could use dollars. Right now I can tip absolutely anyone and they can easily withdraw to their own wallet. It doesnt matter where you are in the world, it works. With dollars, changetip would have to register banking relationships with every single country and hope every single redditor/social media tippers all have bank accounts. On top of this, you can't send $0.10 across the world, there's a higher minimum threshold.

If you'd like to issue concert ticket tokens (tickets certified by the blockchain) then I'd recommend using Counterparty. 
You can create an asset (concert tix) and then people can store them on regular bitcoin paper wallets. Thus you can use bitaddress.org as the generator of paper wallets *(perhaps fashion them up a bit to look more like a concert ticket)* and then the bouncer scans the private QR code to withdraw the concert token. 
As for exchanging bitcoin for fiat, simply use bitpay/coinbase. For people who buy a "ticket" just issue them the token ticket the way you would normally distribute regular tickets.

If you look through my history, you'll see that I tip pretty often. The most common response is a small, "Thanks!"
You're the first person to be offended by me tipping someone in such a dramatic fashion. Your trying to make this into an argument about manipulating social interactions into an insulting price tag when that's missing the point entirely. When zero-effort is required by the tippee, then there is no reason to make such a fuss or get upset over it.


Fuck you dude, you have no control or authority on the ethicality of tipping. Who made you the king of acceptable tips?
I've spent over $40 giving out tips to people, and the reaction is usually always positive. **This is a subreddit dedicated to changing the way we exchange value, using micro-transactions are constantly talked about in this community.** Why are you acting so dramatic over such a small thing? Especially when your the minority voice in all my interactions, why should I think what your saying is the group-opinion?

Thanks for writing that out, I appreciate understanding where you are coming from. But sorry that sounds really subjective.
I've turned several friends and family members into Bitcoin fans. When I go to conferences and use über, the drivers are all incredibly receptive and love seeing me demo it for them and give them some bits for the road.
As to your paypal/coinbase example, I see your point but I've never run into that problem when describing that there is a gradient of control/assisted services that you can choose with Bitcoin. I usually start off with mycelium &amp; paper wallets yet then open up circle to show it's an option. But I'll send money from my mycelium to circle to show that its all on the same network. Thats something I couldn't do with Google wallet -&gt; paypal and people usually see the point I'm making.
Perhaps we hang in different crowds, but many people I know are comfortable with Venmo (free for consumers, similar low cost digital payments vs paypal) yet aren't able to use the service with friends outside the country. Also you can't pay for your meals/shop online using venmo unless a friend covers for you.
I'm much more optimistic in mainstream adoption with services like bitreserve and Coinapult coming on the scene to eliminate volatility. With these tools, developers can then use the programmable nature of bitcoin with the stability of traditional currency. Plus I've only been in bitcoin since mid 2013, but the development of infrastructure and what you can do with it has grown dramatically. I remember back then I bought some honey from a dude of reddit and was stoked. Now I use brawker to make all my online purchases to get the discounts I want and have access to Amazon prime without having it. I use coffee.foldapp.comto get 20% off when i go to starbucks. I love sending micro-tips directly through social media with changetip. Its definitely not mainstream but I would hardly say it's decided as of now :P

Huh? Well first off I want to make the statement that I don't use bitUSD because of its experimental nature. But your calling it nonsense? That's a pretty dumb thing to say about an experiment in decentralized locking that's atleast functioning.
But as you said, locking services that are centralized can be locked down by government. That's why experiments for stable crypto is important. Nubits &amp; bitUSD will hopefully bring about developments in crypto to create stable crypto which adds utility to the whole system.
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:14:17
Oi. This thread is hard to read. Plus Bitcoin isn't even used very much as is because the use-cases are still nascent.
Storj, OpenBazaar, Augur, etc are the in very early stages and aren't mainstream ready. 
Locking services like bitreserve and Coinapult need more integrations (or perhaps use of bitUSD or Nubits). 
The Bitcoin industry itself is also very closed off. If you are a student interested in bitcoin, very few Bitcoin companies *(if any)* have internships or programs to introduce young people into the industry.
What I'm saying is that Bitcoin is still in its early stages and you can't use it very easily for practical applications **(yet)**.
The internet is very complicated yet is used by everyone regardless of gender because of the variety of websites and services that cater to a variety of niches. Girls and guys use the internet because it's useful to them. I think Bitcoin is going to experience something similar *(full disclosure: I don't know what I'm talking about)*

Then they get paid in bitcoin, hold it's value with bitreserve/coinapult/locking service, and then complete the chain with a supplier who will accept it.

Unless all the existing infrastructure development around the bitcoin blockchain will simultaneously switch to another coin; I really doubt switching to Darkcoin is feasible. 
Much better to issue a peg via a sidechain than a completely new altcoin. Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain which is much more important to building infrastructure than privacy *(since privacy controls can easily be adapted to be used within the bitcoin blockchain ecosystem).

I wouldn't go that far. But that's the point of micro-tips isn't it? A very small gesture that is easy to reproduce 
Its not supposed to be a grand gesture but the equivalent of dropping left over coins/change in a hat. If enough people drop small change, then its nothing to the tipper *(meaning they will tip more often and on seemingly trivial content)* yet could add up to a small take-away for the content provider.
I'm not tipping 100 doge which is fractions of a penny. I tipped 10¢.
But even still, I think it's ludicrous to lambast people tipping, no matter how small, in a bitcoin community where the majority of participants have changetip accounts. Is having a tip in the thread wasting your time as a bystander? No, of course not.
If someone was new to Bitcoin, 1000 should be the minimum only because thats the amount needed to withdraw from changetip and play around with it.

@_date: 2015-02-28 15:09:24
Very easy! Create counterparty or colored coin tokens.
The benefit of colored coins is that it has a great mobile app and easy creation process. Plus you can always uncolor the coins to get the bitcoin back.
Counterparty let's you use paper wallets.
You can create whatever kind of token you like and have people exchange it back an forth. It would be similar to creating a local currency on special paper except this time its digitalized and can be issued by a single provider.
@_date: 2015-02-18 15:12:46
Good luck! Try emailing the maintainers of Counterparty and perhaps the LetsTalkBitcoin team. LTB has experience using counterparty to issue their own tokens and counterparty would probably love to help you get setup for this use-case. Especially if it can be modeled and copied by others. 
On top of that, if you get this thing working, you should definitely reach out to CoinTelegraph &amp; CoinDesk to get your story covered. If you get this working, you'll be paving the way for a new use-case.

See how I already mentioned this? I'm just saying it's not impossible. And what's "hacking together" now will become more streamline overtime. I just wanted to point out that the solution technically works and exists already. 
If I was a biz owner, would I bother with this? Probably not, I'd still want the locking services to step up their game and show more why I should trust them. But it's crazy to think this option exists where as before it was a pipedream.

Because the mining network is becoming more industrialized and there are more and more warehouses dedicated to validating transactions versus average joes. 
Before you point out that this centralization of mining is the same as banks; note that the inherent design of bitcoin makes this setup totally acceptable. 
In order to compete with the vast payment processing centers of Visa/MC/Paypal which have huge warehouses, bitcoin needs to equal this industrial setup. Yet the benefit of a bitcoin setup versus traditional is that anyone can build on top of this transaction network versus only Visa/MC/Paypal developing on top of their own transaction network. 
If bitcoin is going to grow up, it's going to become industrialized.

Two years ago bitcoin looked nothing like it did today. Multi-sig didn't exist, buying bitcoin involved moneypaks &amp; MTGOX, buying things online was limited to honey and stickers, almost zero-merchant adoption, and very little VC money invested in different projects.
Today we have a much different infrastructure, much more utility, and there is an explosion of companies with huge VC money to tackle big problems. 
**Two years is fucking long time in bitcoin.**
In addition, *the specific halving time is known to everyone, and everyone knows exactly what will happen.* This is what people mean when they say, it's already "priced-in"
Miners &amp; the infrastructure are planning accordingly... because it's predictable. Mining is ***supposed*** to be a zero-sum game which causes the rat-race development of infrastructure to have a temporary edge. That's what's pushing the development of a professional and industrial transaction network to verify the world's transactions, smart contracts, and other applications pegged to the blockchain. 
Already the blockchain is being used in ways we only imagined of in 2013; the value of this infrastructure grows with the development and utility around it.

Unless all the existing infrastructure development around the bitcoin blockchain will simultaneously switch to another coin; I really doubt switching to Darkcoin is feasible. 
Much better to issue a peg via a sidechain than a completely new altcoin. Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain which is much more important to building infrastructure than privacy *(since privacy controls can easily be adapted to be used within the bitcoin blockchain ecosystem)*

You know what the blockchain doesnt offer? Infinitely small micro-transactions.
Feel free to avoid using changetip then. But your kidding yourself to think the old reddit tipbot was superior or more useful for mass adoption than changetip.
Plus this isn't an exchange. I dont have thousands or even hundreds of dollars on changetip. Who cares if I have a $2 IOU from changetip? And the data concern has already been addressed in the past but you're missing the point that tipping takes place on existing social media channels **which are already free because they sell your information.***

Bitcoin has a rep for buying drugs and coinbase is under heavy surveillance to not allow people to use their service for that. It's easy and quick because they need to have up-front compliance to not be shut down.

Republicans are all about "status quo" and "tradition" until they get in power and break all the rules to fit their interests.
Like when they blocked even discussing a supreme court nomination under Obama just so they could get in "their guy". Or how Barr just ditched the Democratic hearing to avoid questioning while trump simultaneously says he's transparent.
Democrats are not good guys, but they are more incompetent than anything else. Republicans under the current regime are full of hypocrisy.

I have very much fun on this server; those who say it is a scam is a fool and I have successfully bought towns, deposited funds, withdrew funds, earned BTC for mining and digging out my area under my town (huge cavern), etc.
It was an interesting experience because it encouraged me to completely flesh out areas and make grand tunnels and archways that were aesthetically and functionally pleasing. Since I was payed per block break and placement; I was encouraged to spend long term time to commit to projects since the micro work in between was "not wasted" no matter the small amount. 
Just recently this server's faucet ran dry and they are shutting down the claim system. It's a shame because it was such an amazingly simple and functional server that paid BTC for mining, interacting with players, and setting up shops, and you could easily interact with your wallet ingame (that you could easily withdraw from!).
I hope SysDisc finds a way to make his server profitable; maybe add coinurl relinks to the deposit area to make a small profit amount on deposits without taxing the user. Because it's a shame it had to shut down this awesome service.
All the best to you and I hope you can revive the claim system because it really changed the way I played minecraft and made me enjoy spending time on projects (where usually I don't because I consider my time "valuable" and feel lazy when I spend large amounts of time on a video game).
If you need any [free promotional material]( or help with getting a small but consistent trickle to the faucet; I'd do anything I can do to help.  
Thanks for the great time, and I'll be checking in on this server often as it was my favorite implementation of a bitcoin economy into the game.

That's an interesting idea but has some flaws. Since shipping is done by the individual, I have to write the address on the envelop (I've been selling magic cards).

I disagree! There are different purposes. 
The ATM let's you deposit physical money or withdraw physical money as opposed to it being sent to your bank "in a few days". Plus an ATM requires less user personal information and increases the Bitcoin infrastructure and options.

What? What else would they do in the current economy? If they charged 1 mBTC today that could be way to expensive later.
If you can pay in bitcoin that is the first step towards making it more wide spread.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:05:29
I'd recommend that you sweep the coins and then send 1 mBTC to the same address with a note telling him to email you with the secret pass key and a new wallet address. 
It could be an old savings account that someone would never check until cash out time.
Besides if someone has 400 BTC in a brainwallet, I would think it's probably forgotten. No one should leave $400,000 at the whim of someone guessing your passphrase. 
@_date: 2013-10-16 18:58:33
I know that over at they want people to use deckbox to organize their collections. I think if that option allows cards to be easily searchable then maybe someone on that sub can create an account on deckbox and have a bot scan bitmit and constantly add and remove cards that are available to make a dynamic search for available cards on bitmit.
Let's keep bitmit as the transaction and trust service, and somehow make it more flexible and friendly to regular MTG folks trying to see what is available easily

I can understand that he's trying to market to a more mainstream crowd, but by comparing bitcoin to netscape *(even if just metaphorically)* is just flat out stupid. Why would he disenfranchise the customers who would use his product? I know I'll personally stop mentioning bitreserve when marketing locking services.

I always use mBTC when I can, I think it is much more aesthetically pleasing at the very least.
As in, how much 18$ be? .1 BTC or 100 mBTC? I think the latter is much more enjoyable to "receive" and process.

@_date: 2013-12-03 19:38:18
It's really not that difficult. Coinbase and bitpay take care of the entire transaction process. Blizzard simply implements a code with a page to go to when transaction is complete.
No need to train staff because they will see/deal with a USD check from bitpay just like they would from PayPal.
Thus I still think 1% is a huge chunk of money, and they would profit from saved transaction fees. If they gave incentives for users to pay in bitcoin they would save even more (not that they have to). 
Bitpay even provides QuickBooks invoices

But using your same example: coinbase has done amazing wonders for the crypto-community by being a user-friendly on-ramp. It's not a bad thing to have centralization in bitcoin as long as the protocol is decentralized. As long as there is choice and ability to interact with the rest of the network, it works fine. 
Yet unlike banks and other payment networks, coinbase works seemlessly with the rest of the bitcoin network. You can interact with a coinbase account with any wallet/service you wish. Plus coinbase has to account for the bitcoin that they are responsible for.

Bitcoin's properties as a currency is what brought it to it's current worth. The only reason people find it valuable is because of it's nature and ability to be used as a global currency. 
People tend to forget that this movement got here from simply a good idea on a piece of paper. The only reason it has gained so much following and has become the rising industry today is because of how great of an idea that was.

Whoah, honestly that would be incredibly democratizing. As it would encourage people to involve themselves in projects they deem valuable. And if they are invested in a partnership, they are more likely to give more effort and be more motivated for the "venture" to succeed. 
Going with my earlier hypothetical that the nature of banks being less powerful encourages entrepreneurs to seek crowdsourcing or communities of similar minded people (or subreddits like It would encourage small business, allow independence and power to the worker, and creates a much more hyper variety of services and goods with the reduced barrier to entry yet higher chance of success. 
I really enjoy the way this is hypothetically looking. Almost like the perfect baby of communism and capitalism.

Although when people dump, bitcoin is split up amongst more people. It's not just one speculator handing it to a single other speculator.
When more people hold bitcoin, the market is much less perceptible to large money manipulating the market.

"Bitcoin is evil because it prevents governments from collecting taxes" well you know maybe there should be an incentive to change our tax system to reduce monitoring costs and make a disincentive to cheat taxes.

If you don't feel like going through third parties you can craft a simple solution for yourself. Most on here would suggest methods which generate random address to protect users identities, yet this shouldn't be an issue for you just getting started.
* make a bitcoin wallet address and retrieve the QR code
* print out a few with the words underneath "write order number in comment section" and then tape/glue them to some wooden squares (or something else somewhat sturdy).
* when ringing up customers, if they wish to pay in bitcoin give them the receipt and a qr code chip for them to submit payment. This let's he customer fiddle with their phone and allows you to take the next customer.
* have a bitcoin wallet open when doing this so the customers payment will show up ASAP. 
* by the time their food is ready, they should have had ample time to submit payment and this hand you back the qr code piece.
Obviously feel free to rearrange this process as you want; but its not difficult to craft up your own unique solutions :)
Also if you have a tablet, it would not be difficult to get an application to do this all for you.

It's funny that banks think that they ***own*** people's money.
Rather they simply ***hold*** money; and people give permission to the banks to invest and use their holdings. From this permission, bank holders receive a small interest from year to year.
I'm excited for the conditions to be right.
* banks withhold money, and make it difficult for large account owners to have control over their money
* more bitcoin services and exchanges make it *even* easier to transfer USD to BTC
* public fear and panic causes the masses to convert at least some of their savings into bitcoin to prevent further harassment by multinational companies. 
It's time to make banks irrelevant. They crashed our economy because of their greed in 2008 and not only has there been no prosecutions; but even the reform bills that came in it's wake were weak and not effective. Whether or not banks are crappy because of a company momentum preventing individuals from suggesting better methods; banks are too powerful to be beneficial. If they don't care about us, then why the hell should we care about them?

I think that bitmit.net would be a great facilitator of both hosting MTG sales and also bitcoin escrow service with a platform for dialogue between the buyer and seller. 
[Although it would be nice if there was an alternative site to match these available listings to an easily filterable and browsable selection.](
@_date: 2013-10-16 02:33:25
This needs to happen; although I think it would definitely help if there was a 3rd party site to index all of bitmit's MTG submissions. 
The site could use the titles pulled from bitmit and compare them to a MTG index to make all the cards available on bitmit easily browsable with relevant filters. 
Since the selection on bitmit is not fruitful enough to into with a dedicated card in mind; this could allow more vendors to be found and hopefully encourage more commerce!

I would love to be able to spend bitcoin with individuals over the web and have them go through a simple process to receive the payment in USD.
I've been trying to commission some art from and have been getting curious responses but no one thinking there is enough demand yet.

Last time I checked postage on a stamp is 50x the price of a transaction on the block chain.
Plus the block chain gives them a verifiable receipt and protection against charge backs, which accounts for a loss in sales.
TL;DR you are incorrect
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:52:46
You are correct; the current bottlenecks and geographic restrictions would need to change, maybe with businesses applications or protocols.
But I disagree with your second statement although I understand where you are coming from. I agree that kickstarter would not be a good way to raise money for loans to build a local coffee shop, and maybe we currently don't have good crowdfunding solutions because banks currently monopolize that role.
* But look at the porn industry, they created [Offbeatr *(link leads to wikipedia)*]( to crowdfund and vote on specific projects.
* [Seedrs]( looks to enable individuals to invest in small seed startups 
* [Kiva]( allows for loans to developing countries that is actually a loan structure and not just donation. 
* [Zidisha]( allows for microfinancing and peer to peer lending, and aims to be similar to a cross between facebook and ebay.
These are just a few crowdsourcing platforms that offer the modifications to kick starter and indigogo that let's it adapt to the niches it was trying to solve. Your still correct though, these are just a collection of services for a few different specific purposes. As time goes on there would need to be more services (but that's okay because that means there is [blue ocean]( for startups to take over and grow into. 
But I'm confident that the free market combined with creativity of the internet and limitless with bitcoin will provide some pretty interesting solutions that I may have never expected. Also as time goes on and our reliance on banks dwindle, our desire to experiment with other solutions would hopefully be greater even at the local community level.

This would be an awesome step forward in bringing government tied to the success of bitcoin and also makes the coin more mainstream.
**Yet anonymous donations are already an issue with America's democracy; but there is a simple solution to this.**
Any donations sent to the "coffer" wallet addresses must be from a registered participant. As in, people wishing to donate must previously register their donation wallet with the FEC.
There are two things that can happen to donations from unknown wallets (addresses not registered with the FEC).
1. Automatically return any payment not registered back to the sender
2. Any amount given to any party that isn't registered must be donated to the FEC for them to use in an unbipartisan manner
The benefit of this is that by pushing politicans into using bitcoin, even all the transactions coming in legitimately can be traced back much easier (and more openly with more public involvement) then standard currency. Thus faces the same problems as USD with the exception that it is open for anyone to investigate the "coin" trail.
Establishing bitcoin legitimately (as in having everyone who donates registered) would not be an issue. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:56:54
Not really, do you watch the exchanges? Their value usually tends to be within specific ranges until it "breaks through" to a new higher plateau.
Regardless of how sustainable you think this might or might not be; it is stabile enough to easily allow services like coinbase and bitpay to operate (profitably even!).
tl;dr No matter the volatility, the merchant never has to worry about the amount he will receive per bitcoin purchase. It will act EXACTLY like paypal except cheaper. 
@_date: 2013-10-11 15:26:03

The current main crutch to making a relationship between MTG and BTC happen is that there [does not exist a large selection of cards]( There are some; but not enough to be able to seamlessly search for the card you want and find it. I'm currently designing the subreddit to be a forum for people to make *requests for cards not available*, rather then an auction house of available cards. I'm doing this for a few reasons:
* allows people without bitcoin an easy way to convert their magic cards into BTC
* encourages more shops to open up on bitmit.net (increasing selection) from new people fulfilling requests on the subreddit
* give power to the vendors; as currently the best ways to get value out of your cards are to sell them at discount to major retailers (TCGPlayer, Channel Fireball, etc). Meaning that your not getting the full value of your cards. Bitcoin and bitmit let vendors price their cards at market price; without needing to discount their price to sell to a larger vendor. 
* magic cards are very cheap to ship quickly; simply drop them into an envelop and send to anywhere in the US for under 70 cents (less then that if you buy letters in bulk obviously). This makes it easy for anyone to setup a virtual shop of their cards and easily fulfill shipping requests.
* MTG users who fulfill requests can now use the bitcoin they earned on cards that they want (or at least request them).
The magic community is very skeptic of bitcoin; yet I have still [made a few posts]( over the past few months to make sure that interested MTG players can search "Bitcoin" into the and find a relevant result. I'm trying to break down their incorrect assessments of bitcoin and show just how easy it is to setup your own shop. 
*If everything works without a hitch;* there would be just as large of a selection of cards from independent vendors accepting bitcoin as there would be with USD. If this happens then the switch to BTC would be a no brainer; as paypal and other services are illogical to use when your selling cards that are worth less then a dollar.
I'm excited to make this happen, and if you play MTG and hold BTC, I'd love to see you over at Thanks guys! Ideally I'd love for there to be a whole new industry to develop with bitcoin. And if we got the MTG  crowd into BTC, then we'd see an awful lot of independent shops and people making money off of their extra cards. I hope this works!

Ahh highest first, that would definitely sort out all the lesser cards. Still if I'm searching for commons or random artifacts to support my w/b artifact deck then its almost impossible to see all the available artifacts/cards I'd be interested in.
That's why I think the service would be useful; having another site that takes all the available site and link them up to a database so that people can search by color, card type, abilities etc. Is very encouraging for people to browse and then buy.
That would make it much easier to browse the current small selection and find similar cards to what I'm looking for.
Bitmit is great, it just wasn't specifically designed towards magic.
@_date: 2013-09-01 14:44:08
Well when you send bitcoin, you don't actually spend a literal amount. You have to spend within the limits of the transactions that you have received.
So if you received 1 bitcoin at one point, and then 2 bitcoin at another point; you can't just send 2.5 bitcoin. 
So the way the program would handle this is you would send 2.5 bitcoin to the target, and then .5 bitcoin to yourself (a total of 3 bitcoin).
It's REALLY annoying that blockchain.info doesn't compensate for this and simply displays that total amount as the highlighted "button". sooooo stupid

Security is really not that difficult.
Make a wallet, encrypt with truecrypt and store in different places on computer, flash drive, and cloud.

I've actually read some discussions of fellow redditors that the wealth effect is usually looked over when people criticize deflationary economies.
When individuals have an item that constantly rises in value (even when the current price rise stabilizes to trickle growth), they will basically be receiving "interest"/ increased buying power and thus will feel less guilty about making small purchases casually. The incentives are different, but people have the same shopping habits in inflationary and deflationary economies. 
I know I definitely fell for this by making small purchases in bitcoin for magic cards, beef jerky, honey, etc because I've made so much in retrospect to my original investment that it feels like "free" money, thus I'm inclined to spend it. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:30:09
I really think you should have initially mentioned bitpay and coinbase as methods for a company to immediately receive USD from bitcoin transactions.
Don't try to convince people to just start accepting bitcoin, tell them of the solutions they want to hear, such as accepting bitcoin with coinase or bitpay allows you to receive USD for less fees then ALL OTHER TRANSACTION SYSTEMS.
Without that knowledge people would just think that you are trying to pawn off a useless item that they don't know how to use.

I would love for this to become a universal college movement. I've done what I've can by having friends install apps and sending them a nickle or two to show easy and accessible it is. 
While a few are interested, I would love for some more support and possibly local businesses to accept bitcoin payments.
Curiously, I was thinking of methods for companies that need to initialize quick payments; since currently waiting up to 15 minutes at worst for a single confirmation is not practical. Although if the cashier simply printed a receipt with a QR code to scan, then the customer could pay after they have been served (and the cashier's computer should register if the customer paid before handing out the good). This way the cashier can immediately take the next customer and the first customer can simply fiddle with the receipt as they are waiting for their food/beverage/service.
Are there any Kickstarters for such a machine for a company to easily buy that could serve this function?

[This post]( explains their vision well
What if you could really keep what you mined?  What if you could take the rewards of all that hard labour with you?  I set out to create a way to assign real worth, and external data to in-game objects. The first release is The Bit Mines.
My vision isn’t just around a single server but as a way for players to move their “progress” from SMP server to server, or to entirely different games or markets.  You play for a while and accumulate some “progress” and then turn around and buy ranks, items, or memberships on other servers or games when you want to move on.  The benefit being keeping “progress” in the form of Bitcoin and being able to purchase or donate to other servers without needed a credit card, etc.
A Bitcoin backed/based economy would be fantastic

[This is how I do it](
I'm not sure what type of encryption this uses; but you'll need your password to the wallet in order to decrypt it.
This will give you the option to backup to your cloud/offline storage of choice. [SSE]( seems to be the highest rated offline android storage choice. I can't say for sure though as I simply use cloud storage since I tend to keep very small amounts on my phone wallet. 
Remember that your phone wallet should only store "spending" money. As in don't store anything larger then what you'd need to spend for your daily chores. Keep the majority of your wealth backed up on more secure mediums.

Actually, like others have stated; companies can very easily accept bitcoin and automatically have it deposited into their bank account as USD.
[Coinbase]( and [Bitpay]( both have cheap services that allow your company to take bitcoin without every having to deal with it. When your company receives bitcoin as payment, it is sent to coinbase/bitpay and they deposit USD at the exact rate when the purchase was initiated (you don't deal with rising/falling exchange rates no matter the volatility). 
No different from paypal except cheaper and zero chargebacks
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:34:37
Also it seemed like the majority of them had absolutely no idea of the current infrastructure in place. They stated that it takes months or years to get USD from bitcoin when I was able to very easily sell via coinbase and have it deposited straight into my bank account. I don't think they are aware of the services like bitpay or coinbase for merchants that let merchants accept bitcoin without every having to deal with it.
I think these are the points we should be pushing because most people likely have never heard of them or even think they exists. And showing that they exist might be a startling reality to some of them.

Good point, but even if 1% of transactions simply switched to bitcoin, they'd be saving money in those transaction fees differences.

Even if they don't want any themselves, they would see its zero-risk for blizzard to add Bitcoin payment. People on there are saying how blizzard has nothing to gain by accepting bitcoin, which is ridiculous because how can adding one more secure payment option be at all bad?

I would love to play an MMORPG of some sort that enables player economies with Bitcoin. It would be interesting to see how a virtual economy such as world of warcraft or EvE would fair when it's in-game currency is redeemable for USD very easily through portals like coinbase.com.

There is quite a bit of trading, your right on that. But that doesn't mean that it isn't used for payment or buying things.
I've bought and sold various items off bitmit, amazon (through gyft), netflix as well as received payment for graphic design work from over at And were just in the early adopter phase (like all those geeks playing around with the internet to see what they can do), meaning we already have a head start on this game.
Time will tell, but I can see the "only for trading" label go away as more and more business easily add bitcoin payment options through bitpay and coinbase (among other services obviously).
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:42:54
If your in the us I'd advise going through coinbase as they are very secure and easy to use.
As for the movement in price; no one call tell you for sure. That's the fun of it :)

if you centralize around people being able to setup shops; and are able to have great filtering and sorting options as well as allowing users to make their shops and products look good, it would be an awesome service. Give the users the power to make the shops they want without having to set up an escrow or pay fees for uptime.
Imagine being able to link your shop just like you would a facebook, twitter handle. It would be an awesome way to carry your shop with you and advertise your wares.
Regardless of the advice you take; if you are looking for a graphic designer, I've done several projects [for other bitcoiners]( already and would love to help out where needed. Shoot me a PM if interested, and even if not good luck! We need more services like this!

I've been emailing the molten wow team to accept Bitcoin for site donations but I keep getting met by forum limiters or an automatic response via email telling me it wasn't a relevant request.

This is fantastic; be sure to be open to your api to allow for other businesses to provide merchant solutions like bitpay and coinbase.

@_date: 2013-08-10 15:05:56
Right, and in doing so by attempting to "buy out" Bitcoin; people with large Bitcoin shares would obviously ramp up the price of their storage to get the most bang out of their buck. 
So if the government DID decide to do it, they would only further cause Bitcoin to become much more valuable (since you know for SURE that you can convert BTC to fiat). 
So its a catch 22 if the government tries to grab ahold of it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:01:20
try talking to young entrepeneaurs in your networks who would be interested in setting up merchant solutions similar to bitpay and coinbase.
You could have some serious advantages if you were the company that started a bitcoin alliance within the Caribbean to provide easy solutions throughout the islands. 
This is great to hear! I wish you luck! Remember to remain vigilant on these forums (and maybe even setup your own subreddit) so that you can be dynamic with your response to consumer issues. By being first and credible; you could have serious success and I wish you all the best.

Alright, thank you for actually explaining why it's more difficult from what I think. That gives me more understanding of the reasoning behind that. 
I would argue that implementing a script that reads what change is delivered back to the sending wallet to determine the amount received.
Then again, I also understand why they wouldn't want to mess with something like that and use the total amount instead. 
Oh wells.

But then again, as bitcoin gains more traction and this sub recieves more first time users; it would be wise to make sure everyone is easily able to digest information on how to secure their wealth.

That's the problematic thinking that will get us no where. The solution to a sluggish economy isn't some grand big solution worth $X Trillion
It's about reducing barriers to entry, expanding current industries by taking advantage of globalization, and encouraging small businesses and individuals to have skills and education to market their use globally. 
In order to compete, our country and companies need to be flexible on a world platform, and be the first to be innovative in solutions that cater towards making these options more convenient. 
Industries can be built on top of bitcoin, and it has so much benefit to expanding payment and finance to the world (we can take advantage of that if we're smart and not scared!).

Whoah did you make that pebble app?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:47:35
I agree it is annoying but you have to see where they are coming from. 
When they sell bitcoin for USD, the customer can initiate a charge back after receiving the coin and run off without any penalty. That's what the wait time is supposed to prevent. This gate is lifted after you have done a few successful trades. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:16:48
That may be true but it is still a problem that prohibits smaller ventures from starting up. Businesses with large supplies can take a hit it two but not individuals looking to network and exchange. In fact unless you wish to sell bulk, it's way to risky to mail smaller priced items through the mail without protections from a site like eBay. Bitcoin has all these protections built in and allows developers to release solutions that are easily accessible to all.
And thank you very much! Were looking to include magic alter artists to increase to the activity and get bitcoin to more individuals in the magic community.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:55:07
Haha yeah I don't blame individuals for being cautious, for once they actually understand bitcoin and time proves its validity then these individuals will be bitcoins strongest supporters. _Maybe that's a bit exaggerated_, but that's why its imperative that people trying to advocate bitcoin don't start a flame war over it but rather try to make information available. 
That's the only way for them to begin taking us seriously anyways from more then a "cult" ;) 
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:52:07
This is awesome, I wish others would see the long-term benefit of serious coin contenders. Since when has our community embraced monopoly?
Bitcoin is the ultimate experiment and has already won it's vision. Whether or not it's the bitcoin network or some revised and updated version, the world has already been inspired by the benefits of cryptocurrency and the possible uses for them. 
Bitcoin is too large now for risky updates; unless something has almost 0% bugs, it would be very dangerous to push onto the network. Thus I think the best case scenario is to have Zerocoin succeed in the alt-coin marketshare, and then either have it's features incorporated into bitcoin or surpass it on it's own.
After all, it would be significantly easier switching from BTC to ...Zerocoin (What's it's initials?) then from Fiat to Zero. 
I'm still a staunch BTC supporter and will hold onto my amounts for now. We'll see what the future unravels. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:57:17
This is fantastic that such a popular site has an uprising community that desires to use bitcoin!
Perhaps though it might be risky to not use an escrow though. 
As a quick solution I'd suggest the artist sets up a dual shop on coingig.com or some other bitcoin auction site with a dedicated escrow option.
Just a suggestion, I'm still very excited to see people on etsy getting into coin!
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:06:36
Once bitcoin is around longer; it's price rise will be much more stabile (more akin to gold).
In fact, due to it's transparent nature, it is very easy to tell how many miners there are and at what difficulty and how much coins will be dumped onto the market.
Thus deflationary economies will cause more financially conservative spending principles. Don't risk money for slim margins, and that way you are stable and secure for the future until even better opportunities arise (or just use the interest margins for everyday spending). 
It's a little more complicated then the way you described, because if people were to denominate prices in BTC (rather then USD) like in your example; that would mean a much larger crowd using and interacting with bitcoin (more stabile markets).
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:43:54

As banks become more irrelevant they will lose customers and thus weaken their ability to lend. 
I think this idea is nice for bitcoin setup, but in the grander scheme o think startups that make public products should use the kickstarter/indiegogo method of crowd sourcing. 
That way bad ideas die before production and good ideas have a preexisting base. What a perfect lending structure in a decentralized deflationary economy!

Well, bitcoin is valuable because of it's inherent features, and because it's the first currency, it will unlikely be replaced unless another currency offers some real innovations.
To me, a faster confirmation time and more coins is not innovation.   And hardly any altcoins offer more then that other then neat gimmicks (primecoin is definitely cool but doesn't add value).
Zerocoin on the other hand could be an incredibly useful way to make anonymous transactions; so people would trade BTC for ZC and then back again later (thus creating a demand for ZC, and purchase with BTC would be easier then fiat). 
I don't quite understand namecoin too much honestly, but I do know that it's an attempt at decentralizing DNS. Which would be an important goal in removing another controllable part of the web. I would love for a better description of this though.

I mean I honestly think it's because of his incredible affiliation with gold. Would you support the next globalized reserve currency if you had tons of investment in an alternative? Probably not.

**You can accept Bitcoin and NOT have to deal with volatility**
[Bitpay]( and [Coinbase]( are two very reputable businesses that deal with merchant solutions. 
They offer the service: when you receive a payment in bitcoin, bitpay will transact that and deposit USD into your bank account at the exact amount that you charged. **So even if the price is fluctuating rapidly during the day, you have nothing to worry about.**
Think of these services like paypay. You just plop the button on the website and receive USD in your bank account. Except it's a lot cheaper. 


Think about it the other way around though; it is much more likely the a nameless individual will attempt to buy a product and then initiate a credit card charge back. This is great for the gaming and virtual market communities as well as smaller businesses without the ability to track down fraudsters. 
To give an example of why switching the protection is important; I setup a small bitcoin for MTG card community in which I gathered quite a few vendors. +actually earned $500 through this method. The community and entire exchange relied on random Magic players to mail their magic cards in the mail for bitcoin. Different websites exists with an escrow process to ensure protection, but namely this entirely grassroot small community of global players can interact safely with each other without fear of chargebacks. 
It's much easier to develop solutions on the business side; and better and more escrow software is being developed constantly.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:36:24

If you were interested in buying even just $0.10 worth, coinbase allows you to easily buy and sell Bitcoin. If you do sell, you'll have USD deposited straight into your bank account.

I think that Namecoin and Twister serve two different purposes
Having decentralized web verification and hosting is just as powerful as a secured communication network. Especially since this doesn't even use monetary value (which is honestly a breath of fresh air). 
It's not trying to make anyone rich, it's trying to promote free speech.
I still support Namecoin, but I think this is an awesome project: kudos devs 
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:36:37
Wow, thank you so much for putting in the time to break that down. I didn't think about the effect of people feeling "wealthier" and thus having a higher incentive to spend. 
I wish I understood more of the negative effects more clearly; do you happen to know of possible videos for dummies like me to watch over an over again before I reread your statement?
And I agree with you at the end. I understand currency is just how you transfer wealth. But the nature and possibilities that a currency brings forwards obviously shapes the tendency and ability to spend and where.
Again, thanks so much! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:14:15
 It Works perfectly fine as a transfer of wealth (currency). Its use as a storage of wealth has a bit of way to go

Just tried this out, definitely better then coinDL but I ran into a few problems that could be worked out:
*  No area to place an image
*  cannot pay less then 1 mBTC (I wouldn't care if people tipped me a few uBTC) and surely a website could combine small tips with each other in a single transaction. 
*  I couldn't actually download the file I uploaded and ran into errors; although I'm sure this could be resolved as it says it is in beta. 
I like this medium a lot though. It is simple, straight forward, and easy to use. Once they iron out the kinks and allow for a few more features I can see this being a killer platform.
Thanks for showing this to me!

Bummer :/ I would have personally transferred funds before wiping.
But to save useless hindsight, have you tried opening the file on another bitcoin client?
@_date: 2013-11-05 13:34:15
I store all my funds locally on my computer rather then using cloud wallets. Yet to make sure I don't lose my funds to a computer failure; I made a volume with [TrueCrypt]( so that I can put my files on my personal cloud without worry on possible intrusion. 
While I want to do cold storage; I've heard stories of people handling their slips incorrectly and losing funds through a lost "change" address. I know that the way to prevent this is to simply import private keys instead of spending piecemeal of your savings; yet for some reason I can't shake that fear. 
I think the bitcoin community is prime time to start coming out with more usefriendly wallet services. Locally Electrum and Multibit are great, but incredibly not user friendly and a turn off to new adopters. Coupled with their lack of relative safety functions, it's not wise to save more then a few bitcoin in these. 
If we want bitcoin to hit mainstream; we need to tackle making security a no-brainer and easy for everyone and their grandmothers.
Trezor looks fantastic, but there should be less expensive solutions as well. 
@_date: 2013-10-12 16:20:04

Services like bitpay and coinbase allow merchants to add a "bitcoin accepted button" and then these services do all the transaction work and send the merchant the amount in USD for less fees then paypal or any credit card provider. All done automatically and bitpay even services a quickbook invoice.

I'll make drafts and edits FOR FREE until you get the logo/icon/ad you desire, from which I request a cheap payment of around ~.1 to .3 BTC depending on amount of time spent.
I think this project is awesome and I'd love for people to wear Bitcoin swag to show their acceptance of alternative currency. While you said that the site aesthetics are both because of low budget and to attract an older audience, I could give you graphics that would attract a wider audience (being neutral and friendly to attract older and younger demographics)

I can understand why non-bitcoiners are skeptical of receiving them as payment. But were you aware that ***businesses can receive bitcoin and have it instantly converted to USD without the business owner doing anything?***
The great thing about bitcoin is that it's open to everyone, and thus companies have sprung out to provide services on top of bitcoin. 
Coinbase and Bitpay provide the same service that paypal does; let the merchant receive USD in their bank account from purchases on their shop.
* [Coinbase]( allow merchants to accept bitcoin for [cheaper then paypal](
* Merchants accepting bitcoin will never have chargebacks, customers must open a dialogue with the company to discuss refunds and complaints (no more scam buyers)
* Bitcoin providers will never freeze or hold your funds, [paypal]( unfortunately doesn't have the same reputation.
Steam can accept bitcoin without ever even knowing what it is other then the button on their website next to paypal.

@_date: 2013-10-19 13:26:20
but 100 bitcoins most certainly does not equal 18$. And for a vast number of bitcoiners; that would certainly be very confusing
I don't think it would be beneficial to simply reassign the base value of what "bitcoin" is and I think acronyms are a nice way to recognize the constant growing value of bitcoin.
I find that constantly changing the base value of a bitcoin would be much more confusing then adopting the m or uBTC. 
"That will be 100 milis for that product"
same thing except I know thats 100 milibitcoin without needing to change everyone's base value of of a bitcoin

Your right, businesses need more stability; luckily the free market has a solution to this.
Coinbase &amp; Bitpay are two companies which allow merchants to place a "bitcoin accepted" button on their website, and every purchase in bitcoin will be automatically converted (via either of these two companies) to USD at the exchange rate at which it was initially inputted (so you don't deal with the exchange!). At the end of the day the merchant is able to accept bitcoin and have it come into his bank account as USD. 
These companies are both cheaper then paypal and offer merchants protection from chargebacks. It's incredibly easy and takes no risk to start accepting bitcoin (even if your just a small hobbyist).
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:10:20
Because of the laws of our current financial institutions; you would need to link your bank account in order to buy bitcoins online.

The NSA has absolutely targeted all phones; but iPhone has the disadvantage of being closed-source and only viewable by apple developers. Also it is universally installed on all iPhones in very compatible versions. 
Android's seemingly inferior fragmentation is what saves it in this situation. Not only is the source code viewable by everyone; but different carriers even modify this code for individual phones to give custom experiences. This combined with the various versions and the existence of the ROM community that provides even more custom experiences makes it difficult to implement a universal Android backdoor **(especially one that goes unnoticed by a world of volunteer and paid developers).**
Also, if it was to be done on it's linux core; that would present an even larger problem because the source code of linux has the history and larger community of developers that increase the eyeball advantage of Linux over other OS _(which is why most major companies use Linux servers)_. Implementing any sort of backdoor would alert the entire community. 
Correct me where I'm wrong, I'm genuinely interested in this discussion as I think mobile privacy and security are paramount as information has an exponentially increasing importance/application to our daily lives.

Exactly. MT.GOX took advantage of being one of the first and in doing so have pretty much been the front runner used to determine Bitcoin exchange prices.
But their lack of ability to innovate further and create more user friendly services (especially to non Bitcoin users) allowed the entry of other companies.
Honestly though this is a very good trend. The more businesses involved with exchanging Bitcoin, the more popular and stable the currency will become.

Blizzard makes a crap ton of money; and if an increase of %1 in sales is due to bitcoin then why not?
Businesses run on profits and if bitcoin offers profits after implementation, maintenance, and fees; then they are taking a loss by not accepting it. 
1% gain is better then 0% is it not?
This is obviously also ignoring the cheap advertising opportunity as well. Accept a new payment and have your game be the headlines across a diverse global community of people willing to spend money.

Your right, but I'd still feel more comfortable starting the program with little amounts just to give me that extra bit of confidence before I try to move massive amounts of coin.
@_date: 2013-08-12 02:30:39
Okay, so as long as they have 50% + 1?
Would that undermine bitcoin?

This is awesome! I'd love to see minecraft adopt Bitcoin more. For a game that breaks down borders and creates its own virtual worlds; its only natural that players use Bitcoin through escrow plugins as the easiest way to build commerce and economy. 
I'd like to see services like this be used to create micro game lobbies for minecraft competitive games where clans and parties (or solo) compete against each other to earn prizes of Bitcoin (or stuff like that).
I hope that this place receives a bunch of business and I hope players find services like this and make them into something awesome! Let's get that minecraft Bitcoin revolution going!

Bitmit was an amazing site with a simple and efficient escrow, although they shut down pretty recently.
Coingig is the second exchange that I became aware of but frankly I think there service is terrible. I was able to buy a netflix giftcard pretty easily but was unable to host anything.

I would like to know how to verify a domain currently with namecoin. I have a business interested in doing so in order to support the community and to make a news story. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:31:21
Right although services are rising to meet the need of individuals who are not as tech interested. Lookup coinkite; they are aiming to enact a similar credit card solution
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:04:13
Exactly, which is why every bitcoin enthusiast out there constantly educated about the importance of understanding the convenience/risk ratio of online wallets. It's crazy that anyone would have anything more then a bitcoin on a completely third party hosted web wallet. 
Bitcoin let's you be your own bank. Just like the communists who had a difficult time adjusting to the capitalist economy after the end of the USSR; people will learn how to protect their wealth better then any bank could. And there comes enormous benefits towards not relying on a third party institution to make sure that our wealth is secure and will grow over time.
@_date: 2013-09-01 17:48:18
What I mean is that to someone who is not completely familiar to the inner working of bitcoin might be alarmed when they see the receipt of their transaction say "3 bitcoin" when they meant to send 2.5 bitcoin. 
It does say that above, with the proper arrows representing where the money is flowing; but it requires understanding of how it works to know why it displays that. I had to go through that exact process.
I'm not saying the data is unimportant. But it is not user friendly. When you swipe your credit card into a machine, it will display the amount taken from your card, not all the fees attached that are behind the scenes to make it work.
In that same regard, I think the design of the site poorly reflects the transaction as seen by newcomers and thus hinders wider adoption. No one likes to be confused with money. 
@_date: 2013-10-27 01:22:02
A rule?
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:20:39
I disagree. Until we start nearing $10,000 a coin, I think 30 mBTC for $25 is the most psychologically relatable amount.

Fair enough, I guess only time will tell. :)
The way I see it, the current inconveniences are the same that prohibited people from using computers and then eventually email.
Who solved those inconveniences? Microsoft, Apple, Google etc.
That's the way I see at least

I would reccomend the Nexus 7 for your next purchase; it is an excellent tablet for $200 and due to it's popular form factor, has tons of accessories based around it.

@_date: 2013-08-10 15:14:09
Exactly, the value of gold is purely speculative. The only reason you can exchange it for currency is because a large amount of people find universal value in it.
Its not JUST its aesthetic qualities, there are plenty metals and rocks that match "pretty and inert" that are not worth their weight in gold.
But because there is a foundation of services that you can "purchase" through gold makes gold valuable. For that same reason is bitcoin valuable. On its own, (such as its beginnings) it was worthless. Yet as more services came to accept Bitcoin, such as companies that PAID YOU USD for Bitcoin, obviously a market begins to develop naturally. As these companies compete for the limited supply of bitcoins, eventually these bitcoins begin to hold value.
And since they are way easier and faster to transfer than fiat money, it already has extreme value to an emerging global market where you don't want money denominations to be the item holding you back from buying quickly and universally.

Oh? And how will they send the cash from the envelop to their bank account? Are they going to drive it to the bank? 
And have you used bitcoin? Transactions are a few pennies and that's just optional to have your transaction occur quicker.

Although with all the bitcoin bubbles, hasn't the bubble landed higher then when it launched?
@_date: 2013-12-21 19:17:45
exactly this; it has been done and is being done. It's really not hard to implement.
You pay the fiat equivalent at purchase and then it's done. It waits in escrow until vendor ships but there will be no more or less payments afterwards.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:12:27
I did not know this! Thank you!

Forbes should be absolutely ashamed to have such a misleading (and scary!) advertisement. They should absolutely remove that

I'm pretty novice when it comes to namecoin as well. Yet I think NMC aren't meant for purchasing items. Rather they were designed to replace centralized internet verification. 
Ex: right now companies use other companies to verify their website and to tell their customers that the site is legitimate. NMC I think aims to decentralize that process.
Someone correct me though because I'm sure I got something wrong 
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:39:24
**This is absolutely awesome**; I was smiling as I read this. 
Having access to a currency exchange so young has so many benefits later in life towards understanding not only trading but also more vast economic principles. Your training the next experts that will give us the necessary knowledge to create amazing economic feats (because when your children get into bitcoin, they will likely advertise to their friends). 
I would suggest instilling basic security now to prevent "learning the hard way" if possible.
1. Install TrueCrypt on your child's computer
2. Install Electrum. While your child is free to use any other wallet for their other transactions, I would recommend Electrum as a saving wallet because you can backup and encrypt a file once without needing to worry about losing more recent deposits. 
3. Encrypt a volume (using truecrypt or some other software you prefer), containing a *picture* of the seed phrase along with the .wallet. Save and upload this to whatever providers you feel comfortable with (I personally use google drive)
Now you can give allowances and always be able to save your child's funds incase life happens. Plus being interested in security now is definitely something that is going to be increasingly more needed!
Good luck! I hope your kids have fun with this!
PS: As a spending wallet, I personally love multibit!

Does this server pay bitcoin to users for playing? I'm currently looking for a server that either allows a player to earn very small amounts of BTC for breaking and placing blocks or host competitions from time to time (storm the castle, mining contests, and various other games)
I would also like to see more competition servers start up. If your charging for access to your server; you should look into hosting competitions that reward bitcoin back. Would be a good reason for why you have to pay to join, and could get more attraction for your server.
Please take this into consideration, I would love to be able to play minecraft and be able to somehow work bitcoin into that economy. TheBitMines had this function (and you had to pay to join), yet had to shut down their claim system recently, so now it's only MinecraftCC which isn't implemented very well.
thanks, and heres to hoping

Well people really shouldn't think of brainwallets as private. Rather they are completely public wallets that can be visited with combinations of words (without geographic border). 
If your storing massive amounts of bitcoin in a brain wallet then your just asking for a bad day in the future.

Back when the difficulty was much lower, these [USB miners]( were rather popular. Now they are rather useless on their own, but can allow you to earn some marginal (and I mean really marginal) earnings which is kinda neat :P

I can't imagine how handing out Cassie's or paper wallets would be more user friendly then an individual setting up a wallet. How would a newbie to bitcoin understand how to spend their coin? Much less import their funds

Wow! I have not even thought the possibility of that. Thanks so much for that for bringing up the possibility of credit within bitcoin.
I would devil advocate along the lines of what you said towards the end; that at the very least bitcoin's nature allows users more freedom in choosing their preferred institutions; meaning less potential for abuse. And if not that, then even more fundamental would be the existence of a constantly updating and hyper-visible blockchain which would make offline-chains in their nature "sketchy". By this I mean that our current culture is much thriftier and aware of debt and credit (especially the youth) because of the recent recession; and thus similar offline-chains would be looked into with much less naïvte. *Running with more hypotheticals*, issuing credit on top of bitcoin would at least reduce a majority of abuse that comes with issuing credit on top of fiat (because of the public's knowledge of debt/credit and the existence of a currency (bitcoin) that already can be transferred and saved without the need of institutions to do so). 
And I know that we used to be a deflationary economy and that we could use fiat and still be deflationary. But bitcoin's standards improve upon gold; and since bitcoin (hypothetically) would become the next currency, deflation is part of it's make up. That's a difference from a currency that has inflation as it's makeup (but not necessarily it's role all the time).
Regardless, that was a great response, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:50:06
Well in that case I would be happy to help you out there.
Now currently when you want to buy from Amazon.com, how would you make that purchase? You'd probably use your credit card or paypal; both of which are attached to your bank account and transfer money to amazon for a fee.
Now the difference with bitcoin is that to make that same payment; you simply send money straight from your computer to Amazon directly for almost no fees (about a penny). On top of this; no banks, governments, or provider can control your money or charge you fees to use your own money.
While this doesn't seem very significant for someone like Amazon, for small mom and pop shops; bitcoin allows individuals to offer services on a global platform without obstacles. With bitcoin you can accept payment almost instantly from anywhere in the world for free (only the sender pays a penny fee).
Places that have technology infrastructure without banking institutions, such as south america and africa; have much to take advantage of by using a currency which holds value on a global scale. 
This is also being observed in China, where individuals are using bitcoin to store wealth because their own currency is purposefully put down, and their national stocks lose money.
Overall it's a new technology experiment that will transform the way we transact with each other and how we store our wealth.
