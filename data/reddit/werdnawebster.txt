What percent of mining is done by botnet now?

Yep a speculative bubble, not unlike bitcoin, is continuing to cause suffering

Hmm, good point, and it may even be the case that people may choose to lend bitcoin at a lower interest rate than dollars because they are deflationary

OK, point well taken, education coast are inflated by tax payer subsidized loans.
But are you opposed to a person taking on a private loan to fund a MD, or a small business or a house?  And doesn't bitcoin still preclude this?

Almost anyone who wants to become a doctor or researcher must go into deep debt.

I'm not sure when this debt free Golden age you refer to existed.  A loan is not necessarily slavery, when undertaken responsibly it can be an opportunity.

So you work multiple minimum wage jobs until you're 30 and can afford to go to college?  Maybe buy a house somewhere around 50?

I'm not pro one global government here, but what's up with the "we" pronoun? There's way too much group think and extraneous ideologies (e.g. anarcho capitialism) attached to bitcoin, very much hurts broader adoption
Edit: grammar

Ambitious goal, large portions of this population aren't literate let alone financially or computer literate

You've contradicting yourself, you said there were no loans in bitcoin economy.  
But it is true, loans could still occur in a bitcoin economy, they'd just be more risky and very expensive, my original point.  
Nepotism and chronyism should not be the only source of capital.

This is not new:

Exactly, every single person must be invested in for decades before they have a hope of becoming a productive adult.  Some  people just have to pay back a portion of this investment with interest.

I can appreciate your anti consumerism argument.
However, huge problem: deflation exacerbates the wealth gap.  Those massive student loans kids must take on to have a chance at the middle class? If they were valued in bitcoin, it would grow continuously! Financing your small business with a bit coin loan? Bad idea. Meanwhile those who can afford to save  no longer need to invest in productive businesses in order to gain wealth, they only need to sit on bitcoin.
