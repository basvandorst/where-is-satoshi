Head asplode at my own stupidity.  Point taken.  
I suppose interest rates would just have to be marginally ABOVE zero to make it profitable for lenders versus sitting on the money pile.  So yeah, lending would still happen but you'd have to REALLY NEED rather than kinda want something to borrow to buy it.  I think I'd prefer that even if it slows our growth, since it compels people to buy wisely and forces businesses to sell quality items since it'll put the brakes on our consumptive lifestyles.

As long as the negative interest rate is less than the deflation rate, the buying power gained will still be a benefit to the lender.  No different from inflation today - lenders charge you 6% on your house and lose 2% a year to inflation.  Instead they could discount you 2% a year and make 4% profits if there's 6% deflation.  
The part that's hard for people to get their heads around is buying power versus the actual bitcoin (or dollar) amount.  As long as I believe the amount you'll pay me back (even if it's less than what you borrowed) will give me more buying power a year from now than just sitting on the pile of money, I will lend it to you.  We need to stop thinking in absolute amounts because it has no bearing on buying power; all it takes is an understanding of that and a deflationary currency is just as usable as one that's inflationary.

I suspect that there will be lenders who will offer you a negative interest rate on your loan.  Imagine borrowing $5000 today and paying back $4000 tomorrow.  Why would the lender do it?  Because the $4000 you pay back tomorrow will be worth $6000 in today's money, so they're making $1000 in value.
Not much different from lending in an inflationary environment; the lender just has to set a negative rate that they think will be less than the rate of deflation and by the time it's repaid, they'll have gained value regardless of the fact that they got back less than the principal.
