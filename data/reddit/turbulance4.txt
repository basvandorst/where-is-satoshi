That's a good point.

I'm still pretty green to crypto but I'll try to explain my understanding. If there is a veteran who can correct me, please do. Basically I think the following points are important:
* Old HODLers don't need to move to segwit as that would just mean more transactions further clogging the mempool (that is, if they weren't going to move their coins anyway)... Kinda the same way people who own decent fuel cars shouldn't all go out and buy electric, as the production of the car is more important than it's use. 
* ... Thus the move to more segwit use has to be pioneered by the "new users." There is a very steep learning curve getting into crypto and most new users probably don't understand. Personally I still only have a vague understanding.
* ... And industry standard it still set by the major exchanges/wallets. Namely Coinbase, the biggest site (I think) for new users. A new user will more likely just go with what is made easy/normal by the industry.
* Furthermore, and this is more speculation on my part: if the exchanges also have a hand (or financial interest) in mining, it is financially beneficial for them to keep users segwit free, increasing tx fees, increasing the profitability of mining.

In the movie "one million dollars" was laughable because it was so small.

removal for asking the difference? I'd think you would want these posts in order to show the n00bs how it's different.

You're not alone.

I'm curious about this lost coin issue... Is there literally no way to retrieve lost coins? Assuming humans make mistakes, and taking into account that the supply is limited it would seem to imply that every single coin will eventually be lost. Maybe that eventuality is a very long way off, but still.

Thanks, I was hoping someone would notice that

I'm wondering is someone found a method to suggest to Coinbase that they invited people they didn't, as such getting lots of free coins.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:13:31
Yes that makes perfect sense. I was wondering if a pen/paper wallet was a viable option. Seems like a good idea for a backup.
Thanks for breaking it down.
So basically keeping my BTC on Coinbase is like leaving my money in an uninsured bank... If something robs the bank, I lose my money, yea?
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:47:31
That's exactly how it happened for me. But I'm good now
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:31:51
Afaik Coinbase doesn't allow you to determine what fee you want to pay. They just tell you want you are going to pay in fees.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:59:56
... I didn't
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:35:46
It says it... But I don't think I did.

Hmm... Interesting. I noticed there are lots of wallet options out there. Can you say anything about choosing one? I purchased off Coinbase which has a native wallet. I also setup an Electrum account. I want to say I should move the BTC to my wallet unaffiliated with Coinbase, but I can't say for sure why. Also I'm not sure why one wallet would be better than another.

1. Make a few bucks with a small amount of savings I have stored. Or lose it maybe, I guess.
2. Understand BTC so I know what I'm doing when it takes over the world economy sometime in the 2020s.

That's not really correlated to the price, but the transaction load (vs blockchain transaction limit)

Some years ago, I looked into adding solar. My finding was that the time it would take to recap installation cost was greater than the expected life if the panels.
Now this was ≈ 8 years ago, maybe it's more profitable now?

I navigated to Coinbase to see my transaction history and sure enough, I have $10 extra. Pretty sure that'd be a shitty way to phish.

I have .01btc from right before it hit 10k the first time. Not much and the the price bottomed out so hodling wasn't difficult. I suppose the real test is about to begin.

Overthrow is a strong word. I do like the idea of separation of money and state though.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:10:27
Thanks. I was starting to formulate that idea on my own, but it helps to have someone in the scene confirm it.
Would you say all the alternates are crap?
@_date: 2018-11-28 15:49:50


Ok, here's what I mean: maybe I don't understand capitol gains well enough, but... Pretty much all of 2018 has been a bear market. Who out there has made gains on BTC this year, that they need to pay taxes on? Even if a few traded luckily and made a few bucks on a quick uptick, that's not going to be the vast majority of the BTC owners.
I'm just saying is doesn't seem logical do claim a full years bear maker is due to people pay taxes, as there weren't any gains to pay taxes on. Now if the 2018 chat was bullish through most of the year than took a sharp decline near the end, that explanation would make sense to me.

The general patreon-YouTube model is that the patron gets to ask questions and early access to videos, and everyone gets to see them.
He'd probably drum up more patrons if he'd put his full q&amp;a sessions on YT, free of charge.
