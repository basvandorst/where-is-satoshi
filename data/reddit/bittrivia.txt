Anyone who loans money, invests money, saves (hoards), or spends money makes that choice in comparison with other options. The rate of economic growth is very important - this is the average rate of return you can get with your capital. If you are making a 30 year loan to someone looking to buy a house, you would make that loan only if you feel your capital isn't put to better use over those 30 years doing something else.
With bitcoin, the supply side of the money stock is fixed, and only the demand side has to be predicted. With fiat currencies, not only do people need to predict the demand side, but also what the central bank will be doing on the supply side.
There is no way bitcoin can be used to denominate loans at the moment, because bitcoin is still experiencing exponential growth. It needs to mature and stabilize before this can happen. But it doesn't matter whether the money stock is increasing or remains the same - it's the same supply/demand calculations.
Now, you bring up the point about hoarding. No one hoards for the sake of hoarding. People save money to transfer value from the present to the future. It depends on people's time preferences for money. We've experienced price deflation in consumer tech products for the past decade - that doesn't stop people from buying them. The more people save money, the more purchasing power the people who are spending money right now have. There is less money chasing goods and services. Conversely, if more people spend there is less purchasing power now, and more in the future.
When central banks increase the money stock, it only serves to transfer purchasing power from all holders of fiat money to those who are able to borrow and spend the new money first.

Let's use your example with 2 different currencies: one with a fixed money supply, and a second with an inflating money supply. To simplify things I'm just going to use a one year loan.
Bitcoin example: 1 BTC @ 1% interest for one year  
Assume fixed money supply.  
Assume 2% more goods and services in economy next year.  
Principal: 1 BTC  
Interest: .01 BTC  
Future Value of 1 BTC: amount - amount*economic growth = .98 BTC  
Real rate of return: economic growth + interest rate = 3%
Fiat example: 1 USD @ 1% interest for one year  
Assume money supply increases by 4%.  
Assume 2% more goods and services in economy next year.  
Principal: 1 USD  
Interest: 0.01 USD  
Future value of 1 USD: amount + amount(money supply growth rate - economic growth)  = 1 + 1(0.04 - 0.02) = 1.02  
Real rate of return: economic growth - money supply increase + interest = -1%  
So just because 1 BTC from last year had equivalent purchasing power of .98 BTC this year does not matter. Your 1 USD from last year had the equivalent purchasing power of 1.02 USD this year.
What matters in both situations is real rate of return. In the first case your real return is 3% (2% growth + 1% interest). In the second case your real return is -1% (2% growth - 4% money supply increase + 1% interest), which is better than -2% if you hadn't made the loan.
The 4% money supply increase is a wealth transfer from all currency holders to those who receive the new money first.

When someone issues bonds or annuities, they won't do it with a negative interest rate. If you have a 48 month 10 BTC car loan @ 1% interest, you'll have a .21261 monthly payment totaling 10.20528 BTC. With a fixed money supply, your nominal rate of return is 1% and your real rate of return is 1% + economic growth. With a fiat currency, your real rate of return is 1% + economic growth - growth in money supply.
Now obviously you can't have negative interest rates. If a lender believes the economy is going to grow at 2% a year, they are not going to make a loan which only gives them a real rate of return of 1%. Instead they will simply hold the currency. What this in effect does is frees up land, labor and capital for the rest of the economy to more productively use those resources, and the hoarder is rewarded because the purchasing power of their money increases by 2%. It's essentially a loan to the rest of the economy, giving them more purchasing power now. It requires them to consume less, and frees up resources to flow into investment capital.
If everyone hoarded and no one put resources into investment capital, then the economy is not going to grow, but rather shrink. Now the purchasing power of everyone's money has decreased because there are fewer goods and services produced. It would have been better in this case to have invested in something or bought debt, rather than hoard.
What you have is an equilibrium. People will invest and buy debt when they feel the investment is going to increase economic growth. People will not make investments and buy debt which would decrease economic growth. People can choose to save money now and transfer purchasing power to investors and consumers. Or they can consume or invest themselves.
Lastly, re: your example. Any investment in bitcoin right now is speculation that it will grow to be a mature currency. So yes the homeless man, or any of us can speculate on bitcoin right now and come back later rich if bitcoin succeeded or poor if it failed. Existing wealthy people have capital - they are going to allocate that capital where they get the biggest return on their investment. They will probably not be keeping the majority of their capital in fiat currencies, because they would be losing wealth. Whether we have bitcoin or fiat currencies doesn't matter. In a capitalist system, people can choose to allocate their capital how they want. The ones that allocate it well will become wealthier, and the ones who allocate it poorly will lose wealth.

There is an equilibrium. If everyone hoarded their money, it would not be used as a medium of exchange and its value would go down. If its value starts going down, people don't want to hoard it they want to spend it.
The other thing to understand is that economic actors can 1) consume 2) invest or 3) save. You may think that saving/hoarding is bad for the economy, but in actuality it is just giving consumers and investors more purchasing power now, and saving your purchasing power for a future time.

You can have debt in inflating and deflating currencies, so long as they inflate or deflate by a predictable amount.
With a currency like the euro inflating at 2% a year, to get a real rate of return of 4%, you would have a nominal interest rate of 6%.
If bitcoin ever stabilized such that the goods and services in the bitcoin economy was growing at 2%, bitcoin would deflate by 2% (because the money stock is fixed). To get a real return of 4%, you would have a nominal interest rate of 2%.

A stable monetary supply is not a problem. The problem is fractional reserve banking. With fractional reserve banking, the money supply can contract and grow sharply depending on how many new loans are issued and how many are paid back. A fractional reserve system can only survive by making more and more loans and continuously inflating the money supply. It's essentially a transfer of wealth from all currency holders to recipients of new loans and the banks that finance them.
With bitcoin, as long as bitcoin and not bitcoin substitutes are accepted as payment, we won't have this problem.

Look at it this way: if you have a currency with a stable money supply, everything else being equal, the currency will deflate by the amount of economic growth. So say there's a real growth rate of 2%, the purchasing power of the currency will also increase by 2%. There is no incentive to make loans unless the real rate of return is greater than average economic growth. So you could still make a loan for 1%, for a real rate of return of 3% which is higher than if you had just held the currency. Loans with a real rate of return below 2% will never be made. And this is a good thing. It discourages making bad loans. Only loans which can positively influence economic growth will be considered.
Edit: And yes, right now it would be foolish to make a loan denominated in BTC because it is still growing rapidly and there is much price discovery left to happen. But you can easily make a loan denominated in another currency but payable in BTC.

Competition among currencies is a good thing. I can see fiat currencies, gold, silver, and cryptocurrencies competing for Medium of Exchange and Store of Value in many different markets.
Bitcoin benefits from the network effect. Even if there are 100 other alt coins, making the supply of cryptocurrency approach infinite, it doesn't matter. Copper and aluminum compete with gold and silver but don't provide much of a competition! In the same way, Feathercoin, Freicoin, etc., while bringing new supply of total cryptocurrency, do not undermine the usefulness of Bitcoin's limited supply.
As stated in the article, they provide useful fallback currencies in case something happens to Bitcoin. They also serve as playgrounds to test out controversial features, which can be incorporated into Bitcoin if they prove useful.

Ok so you have an idea where you can get a real rate of return of 1%. What do you do then? You buy land, labor and capital with that money. You are taking scarce resources and applying them to your little project which is only giving a 1% return. If you had left those scarce resources available, the rest of the economy would get a 2% return from them. Making a loan for a 1% return is a bad loan because it is taking away those resources from more productive actors.
@_date: 2013-10-28 16:22:03
Loans priced in a volatile currency don't work whether the currency is inflationary or deflationary because there is too much risk to the borrower or the lender.
As bitcoin grows, it will be subject to swings in value. However, as it matures, the volatility and rate of deflation will decrease. Picture this scenario in the future: Bitcoin is a major currency and is used in 25% of transactions. Because the supply is essentially fixed, Bitcoin will deflate by the increase in economic growth. If economic growth is 2% per year, Bitcoin will deflate by 2% per year assuming everything else is constant.
This can be priced into the loans which are made. For a nominal rate of 1%, lenders are really getting a 3% return. Lenders won't make loans where the real rate of return is 2% or less, since the lender can just hold Bitcoin and earn 2%. This is the way it should be - bad loans are discouraged and only good loans are made.
For now, while Bitcoin is still volatile, loans can be denominated in a more stable currency (or basket of currencies), but still payable with the Bitcoin equivalent.

Here's my translation of it:
Bitcoins, money on the Internet
This internet money functions similarly to a gold standard. Bitcoins are a unit of account which people can use to pay with at certain internet businesses. The German federal government has recognized them officially as "private money". 
The funny thing is: the currency isn't created by a central bank, instead it's created by solving certain computer puzzles, which for all other intents and purposes are useless. These puzzles can only be solved with extreme computing power.
A discomfort with the current monetary system remains
The whole thing is constructed so that the quantity of Bitcoins are gradually introduced into circulation and there is a fixed upper limit. Whoever creates Bitcoins ("mining" is the term people on the Internet use), can profit from seignorage. For Bitcoins to be useful, the supply has to be limited (not arbitrarily increasable), people can exchange them for euros, dollars or yen (dependent on supply and demand), and there needs to be places which accept them as money.
Admittedly, there can be problems observed with Bitcoins which can also be seen in similarly constructed monetary systems outside of the Internet. One is anonymity. Because people can use Bitcoins anonymously, similar phenomena as with cash can be seen: they will be used for illegal trade. Cash is ultimately more preferable for criminals to accept payment in than bank transactions because it's harder to follow the trail.
Moreover, the price of Bitcoins fluctuates extremely due to speculation: on April 10th, 2013 between a high of 263 dollars and a low of 135 dollars. It is somewhat reminiscent of the last days of the gold standard: at the time speculators made bets on whether  America would renege on its commitment to a fixed exchange between dollar and gold, which caused extreme difficulties and ultimately contributed to a dissolution of the gold standard. Also with Bitcoins, people bet on whether they will be very rare some day because of the 21 million limit, or if the whole system will disappear into the bowels of history.

Even with an inflationary currency, people can choose to put their wealth in a number of different places:
1) Treasury bills, bonds
2) CD's
3) stocks
4) Gold, precious metals, commodities
5) real-estate
Even though the yields on some of these investments are pretty good, it doesn't stop people from buying things, including non-essential items. Generally as people get wealthier, spending on luxury, non-essential items goes up. As people get poorer, it goes down - regardless of whether you have an inflationary or deflationary currency.
Bitcoin is just another asset class. Instead of people having to get rid of their inflationary currency before it loses its value, people can choose to hold some of their wealth in Bitcoin just like they can now with Gold or other asset classes which aren't prone to inflation.
