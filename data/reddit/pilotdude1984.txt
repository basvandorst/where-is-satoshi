Just spoke to my brother in law who is south Korean and invests in Crypto.  He hasn't heard of this, he said maybe on the 20th...

100 period SMA is above acting as resistance, volume is real low. However, January is over, and January typically sucks and Russia is allowing bitcoin so it's hard to tell. I placed my stop losses and ready to take profit if it drops below the lower boundary of support. Hoping for the best!

below 10K for sure!

Last line of defense is SMA! It'll be at between 12200 and 12300 when bitcoin drop hits it... HODOR!!! HODOR!!!

There's nothing stopping it...
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:40:24
Why not SMA 50? thats where the initial correction stopped, around 11200 at the time....

Hold bitcoin, I wouldn't touch LTC or Ethereum at the moment, but check out vertcoin. Vertcoin is less than 10 bucks at the moment, soon they are setting up a "coinbase like" account to transition USD direct to vertcoin, i personally believe its the next litecoin.

James, Exile, don't worry I made up for both of your mistakes... I purchased about the time you all sold so I appreciate your coins! 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:21:36
broke through the 50 SMA like it wasn't even there... next line of support is 100 SMA at 8500... unfortunately for me my ROTH IRA is in GBTC so totally screwed till tuesday, at which point i will just hope over the next few months bitcoin will rise to above 10k again...

More USD/ALT trades, altcoins should not be affected by bitcoins flaws.
