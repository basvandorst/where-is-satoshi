The butthurt is because we know what Dogecoin is (a Bitcoin copycat that can not benefit Bitcoin and has nothing innovative to add here), and we don't care about it. The only reason Dogecoin posts keep appearing on are here is because dogecoin fans are flooding upvoting the hell of it here.

The credit system is actually really good, but it's a subject for different discussion. IMO, even in a world that Bitcoin conquered all other form of currency, people will use Bitcoin as a savings-clearing house with a very minimal deflation, and doing daily trading using different versions of credit currencies (some backed by hard-assets, maybe energy, or promise of future products). Credit is not bad in itself in our economy. Credit is actually good because it helps facilitate promising investments. What's bad is that credit creation is unbounded, self-propelling and unsustainable, while controlled by a cartel of bankers and politicians who benefit from it.

The only doge content I see is continuous flow of people trying to promote doge on and tipping $0.01 of Doge, thinking they are making any difference or impression on anyone.
Doge has no real ubiquitous appeal. If anyone tip me decent amount of Doge (keep your $0.01 worth of Doge for yourself, and don't waste my time), I'll sell it immediately for BTC, because it's Bitcoin that has real ubiquitous appeal: years worth of history of stable community, infrastructure, recognition, people willing to do real work for it, merchants that are accepting it. Doge has semi-funny pictures of a dog.
And it's not I disregard all altcoins. I'd switch or partially switch from BTC to anything that is really better (I'm looking at you Ethereum). But Doge is a joke of altcoins. And because it's a joke idiots are flocking to it like crazy. And there's plenty of idiots all around the Internet. The only problem is idiots don't have that much to give the currency a value.

No it's not. You've got two systems, exactly as centralized, as one bigger system.

If they are not enabled in production, why are they exposed? :P . Bad practice. You could enable some "beta.greenaddress.it" vhost for beta features etc. But oh well, thanks for explanation.
I'm not a best person to give advice on how pages should look and it's all subjective. I was trying trustedcoin and their page looks much better for some reason (IMO). 
Also, the name is bad. You seem to be web wallet and greenaddress seems misleading. Someone else was complaining about it in comments, and I agree with him/her.
Overall, comparing to trustedcoin.com you seem to aim at better configurability and more features, but they are not working yet it seems. Especially the hierarchical wallet would be usefull. However, overall trustedcoins make much better impression: more polished, simple and clear about the meaning and how it works. With all these PINs, facebook logins etc. I'm not even sure do you keep the copy of my keys or not. I don't want to discourage you: just providing the feedback.

This video made a big impression on me and I think I'd like to support someone in a country like Uganda to help make their life better.
I usually don't help charities ( I sometimes support Red Cross) etc. because I have little trust in them, and there's little to no personal touch in it. I know it's selfish, but when I'm helping I'd like to at least get the email with "Thank you!" from the direct beneficent of my help so I can be sure I'm really helping someone to get some real shit done.
So, I would like to copy-cat this video a bit and find someone that I could directly help building a business, getting education etc. by sending some agreed amount of money with Bitcoin every month or something. The question is: how do I meet such person, and how do I make sure my money are being given in a good cause?

There is no need for any unity between altcoins or philosophical overthinking of anything. Money is practical thing. Cryptocurrencies do not require trust or unity to work like expected. We don't even have to like each other and still conduct business. And that's what I like about Bitcoin, not a false idiotic sense of unity.
I don't care about dogecoin as an altcoin. I don't hate it per se, I just don't see the point of it, I don't consider it valuable and I'm not going to be actively accepting it. But is continuously polluting with worthless crap. In fact it's polluting other subreddits that I read too (

This whole MIT report seemed stupid to me. There's no way to know what is spending and what is just transfer of BTC between one's own wallets.
Bitcoin "hoarding" is a good thing and it is what gives Bitcoin value in the first place. Only fraction of all Bitcoins are in circulation and this is what makes the valuation of $1000 and more very reasonable. People save 99% of the time, but the whole point of their savings is to spend at some point, and when they spend their Bitcoins are really valuable.

Bitcoin by itself is not suitable for retail (directly). End of story. This is not a big problem, as building service on top of Bitcoin that would be suitable is not a big deal.
Hardware wallets and N to M signing are the answer to security. These are in progress.
Consumer protection is not an issue. If you want consumer protection use something on top of Bitcoin (eg. escrows). If you paid for Trezor (just like me), you should be aware that people making it are grass-root Bitcoin community members, and not professional company. You trusted them, noone put a gun into your head to do it. Don't cry for "consumer protection" now, if you knew beforehand that there is none. 
All of these problems are problems of Bitcoin infancy, nothing else.

It was obvious that mining is not going to be profitable for most people after ASICs were developed. The mining revenue is fixed (25BTC / 10 min) and because of inertia (long hardware production and delivery times) people just overshoot the numbers. Too much competition means the least effective miners will have to drop out, and the least effective are usually hobbist miners: no connections (so no good deals), no scale, no nothing. My friends are now thanking me for stopping them from investing into Bitcoin mining.
I'm sorry to say this again but one part of why Bitcoin is thriving is because of many people being naive. In that case naive miners got Bitcoin better hash-rate thus security.

Yeap. I wonder if we could potentially just use `u` in casual conversation. Like "I got tipped 5000u".
I personally switched to uBTC (in my head and Mycelium Wallet). The nice thing is, it's kind of natural to think about full-Bitcoin as milion of uBTC-s. I don't have to play with any fractions, while the numbers for actual things like coffee, transaction fee, lunch, are not all that big. A 1000u is almost a dollar nowadays.

The price was 1BTC during the time of purchase. Anyone that bought then, was apparently happy about the price at that time. Myself included.
Enough of preorders was gathered because of smart pricing strategy and noone cares now that you don't like the price ATM. Trezor guys are free to modify or stick with any pricing they want as long as they honor previously made orders.
You're not smart enough to see that nobody cares about what price would you like to see and when. You're not smart enough to see how big of a deal trezor is for whole community, and not only people that ordered one. You're not smart enought to see that what they did bloody worked.

I would recommend encrypted clean Ubuntu installation to every Bitcoin user that is not tied to Windows due some heavy constrains. This can save a lot of money.

Your desktop probably does not have GSM connection. But yeah. I like your paranoia, son.

Next time company puts prices in BTC for something I want, I'm going to buy ASAP, just like I did with Trezor. 
You can do whatever you want, nobody cares.

For 1BTC (~$500) I think blockchain.info is reasonably secure. But not for much more. There is still whole class of attacks that can be used against it. And recently they rather poorly handled some security issues, which somehow lowered the trust of community.

An embedded software engineer here: please remember that you can not trust your phone with bigger amounts of Bitcoins.
There are many hardware parts in your phones, most of them have design bugs, firmware bugs, software bugs, some of them that could be potentially even remotely triggered. These things are real, no kidding, it's just understanding them requires years of experience in the industry etc. In practice it is really, really hard to exploit them, but with ever increasing value of Bitcoins, you don't want to risk even theoretical threats.
Sorry for interrupting, and yes, Mycelium looks awesome. Great work!

Fuck them, and fuck every merchant that will use them.
