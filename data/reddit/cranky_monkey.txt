Are you honestly trying to make a case that person taught basic math automatically understands core economic theory?

While there might be problems with it, I'd say that if we're in the rebuilding/fixing game, I'd trust folks that actually understand the economy/economics and all it's complexities over some uninformed, lightly-educated citizen.

Millenial takes PoliSci 101, but hasn't taken any econ classes yet (graphs and formulas are hard, man!).  Forgets to take prescribed ADHD meds, goes on Reddit rant.
Fun ensues.

No, your "poke" was ambiguous.  It was in response to my response criticizing the OP lack of economic education.  It seemed to infer that basic arithmetic is enough to understand the global economies.
Learn to Reddit better, please.

I don't get it.
If you owned a trezor, you'd just periodically sweep your "small and new purchases" into your trezor wallet directly from the exchange.
Why have a middle step?

It seems like your mixing and matching terms on the thread responses here, so I thought I'd clarify so everyone is on the same page.
You use the term "online wallet."  I *think* you're meaning your online exchange account/wallet (like say on Coinbase).  Not really a true wallet in that you don't have control over the keys....Coinbase does.
Software wallet:   A piece of software you download to your phone or computer.  You generate a public and private key upon installation.  You then send crypto to your public address generated, then synch the wallet.  Now the crypto is "in your wallet."
Hardware wallet works the same as software, but there is a piece of USB hardware you attach, and the software just manipulates that hardware while plugged in.  I.e. it helps transfer the crypto onto the memory storage of the device, encrypt it, etc.   The value of hardware wallet is that once it's unplugged, even if your phone or computer is compromised, they cannot get to your crypto.  
This is why some folks will say that you really need a hardware wallet for large amounts of crypto.

I don't use the API function as I'm still a low volume trader.  I rely on the manual import/export function.
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

I've been using it for about a year.  I wanted something to track all my crypto as I began in it, etc.
It's a bit stilted in how it portays your overall portfiolio and it took me a while to get how it works.
Basically, you have to start by recording a deposit of fiat into your account.
Then, you'll trade that, with fees, for a crypto.  You can fill in the transaction details as needed, etc.  This will debit out the fiat above, etc.
Then record all your future trades/deposits as above to get a total picture. 
Make sense?

Lol....hilariously funny response.
Thank you for taking the time, man.  I really do appreciate it.  But I was sorta asking for sites/books on HOW to read the charts themselves?   Stock, crypto or otherwise.  A way for a layman to ease in to it.
