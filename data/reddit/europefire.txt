They changed a couple of things about the structure of transactions though. I don't know if their technically crippled dev team can handle the merge without accidentally hardforking into bcash1 and bcashcash.

I should point out that if you saw a 2x ROI in the past 3 months, you're underperforming hodlers. Don't borrow money to gamble.

Impressive analysis. Thanks for your hard work.

FYI, it is in the sidebar :)
As a rule of thumb about mining: if you have to ask how, then you probably shouldn't be doing it.

You can _almost_ afford the fee to move it out of your wallet now!

These _have_ to be seized coins, right? Otherwise, I'm pretty sure Bitfinex would've already been instructed to freeze the accounts. CMV.

There are two ways to solve block size limits. Make the information more compact (segwit) or scare away all the users (BCash)

Indeed. When I saw the video was posted on this channel I feared for the worse, but she REALLY knows her shit. 
Antonia Antonopoulos, if you ask me.

Thanks for doing this Naomi. I subbed to your channel ;)

Still waiting for that evidence though. This could be used as an argument for zero inflation. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:48:15
Bullshit. I've read this in economics books but never saw any proof. This sounds like these "truths" people believe in because everyone else is saying it.

When I was entering the cryptosphere, I posted there asking about my asset allocation in crypto. 
I got a lot of shit, and also fairly reasonable answers telling me why I should sell my BTC, XRP, DOGE, LTC, etc... I did, I sold most of my BTC and all of the rest for a few hundred bucks. 
I would be close to hitting the 800k mark now. 
EDIT: I dont blame them, it was on me. However frustrating it is. /rant

wat. For Bitcoin? Is that even a thing after like 2013?
@_date: 2019-02-19 15:57:54
Someone who thinks it's worth more, from someone who thinks it's worth less. Both exist, because the question I'm my head has been "who's selling at these prices?"

You don't need GitHub to use git, but indeed I believe Satoshi never used git for his initial work

Wallets are always going to have a default fee, which is pretty handy IMO. 
Even if they allow us to enter the fee, most users will just go with the default.

ASICBoost allows a significant speedup in the PoW mechanism by allowing miners to reuse some work.
When you look at a block that was mined using covert ASICBoost, it is not obvious that ASICBoost was used. 
Overt ASICBoost still gives you the speedup but everyone can see you used it. 
I remember reading a fairly involved paper on this. Let me know if you want a link.

I didn't know about this bot. Brings me back memories from dogetipbot &lt;3

It is a good question. 
I mostly agree with the opinions in this sub, but this one never stuck with me. I don't have time to reply now, please read the argument elsewhere, there were hundreds of these discussions in this sub. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 12:25:52
Cant find the paper anymore, but that's a pretty clear explanation. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:56:17
Isnt this mostly about shady ICOs? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:06:39
It's about Silk Road, not just about Ross, but as you may guess Ross is a big part of it.

There is no real limit anymore because of ln, but for on-chain transactions I think it was around 30 transactions per second IIRC.

I have read both.
For the deep understanding, read "Mastering Bitcoin". Latest edition has Segwit, I believe. It is available online for free. 
For a non-technical overview of the motivations behind bitcoin, read "The Internet of Money".
