Rpi 3/4 with a 1 TB HDD!
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:27:07
Too late. There we go. Not our day with auto-correct.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:09:33
No worries, take it slow. The github and community surrounding RaspiBlitz is amazing and will help you along if needed! There's build guides and a lot of other great info on the GitHub too!
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:25:01
Here's a good comparison!
@_date: 2019-07-09 18:07:50
Apologizes, Antenna* Still very excited!
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:26:18
Absolutely. Lot's of nodes are beginning to turn to TOR. We run both! :)
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:16:56
It might be possible, we'll get in contact with NVK and see how easy it would be. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:21:06
Yeah... We're not proud of that title...
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:25:18
Not at this moment.
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:02:28
The fan mount comes stock, it's made for tinkers who want to add extra. 
The following fan will be the one to order for the Rpi 4 to work with the Lightning Shell to help keep it cool. 
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:13:35
If Bitcoin and Lightning Wasn't cool enough, we read about Blockstream's Bitcoin Satellite and instantly knew what we'd be doing with our shops retired Dish Network Antenna. Follow our progress on the build here!  [
We're currently following this guide in case anyone else wants to build one! 
Another great resource is Blockstream's GitHub [
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:59:06
Thanks... Wish there was an edit!
@_date: 2019-07-24 00:42:12
Agreed, the blockchain and most data is stored on the HDD and RaspiBlitz now allows backups on it too!
Back up your keys!
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:10:32
We've listened to all the feedback from the amazing community and we've updated our Lightning Shell to improve!
\- Added side ventilation to greatly improve heat dissapation
\- Added the option to mount 40mm fan inside the case, with fan mount
\- Added the ability to wall mount your node on the wall
\- Updated the front cover for a better look!
\- Now works with RPi4!

That would be our Glow In The Dark Filament! Possibly one of the coolest ones we have!
@_date: 2019-07-23 20:00:28
Are you building a RaspiBlitz?
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:25:30
At this moment, we are not selling the STL file.
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:13:32
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:25:49
We do! We just activate free shipping for all US customers and reduced international shipping by 20%. We're pretty excited!
@_date: 2019-07-10 17:39:38
@_date: 2019-07-24 03:15:44
Not at all. You could however run your node with TOR to eliminate any problems with not having a static IP and also hiding you're external IP.
@_date: 2019-07-23 21:11:06
Benefits of running your own node - never trust verify, your keys/your coins.  
Benefits of our case - Talking piece, customization to make your node yours, Why not have a bad ass looking node?
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:59:46
@_date: 2018-09-05 10:23:25
Also an option!
@_date: 2018-09-04 11:03:27
We probably should have gave you more info!
These are hardwallet mounts that help keep your Ledger Nano S hidden and secure with 4  screws. 
We have several other options of mounts, Trezor and KeepKey included and also have cases for OPENDIME and Leger nano s.
Check out all or products here, 
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:56:30
Great stuff!
@_date: 2018-09-04 11:04:03
We absolutely should have, thanks for bringing this up, we missed out on some details!

We hope you love it! It's being sent out tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:31:47
Plus we love lightning, so we might as well make it look cool!
@_date: 2018-10-22 19:45:22
At least it was easy! Glad you got it! Cheers!
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:29:51
That's the plan, and that's a really good idea about the screen being optional! We'll keep everyone posted.
@_date: 2018-10-17 20:34:18
If the torrent doesn't work, trying download from ftp. That worked for us!
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:44:15
I had to try a few times to get the download through ftp to work. Don't keep what you already downloaded either, that messed mine up.
@_date: 2018-10-26 15:31:28
 r/   
Almost ready!
@_date: 2018-10-18 18:04:21
If any of you are going to the Lightning Hackaday in NYC, there will be a few there! We sent some to  and 
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:37:36
That's our next task!
@_date: 2018-10-24 13:33:26
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:18:51
MasterCard and Visa need to learn, we don't need their involvement.
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:12:00
Hope it works! I had trouble doing that, but I know it has worked for others. I wish you luck!
It took us about 1.5 weeks to finally get it working, but we are also noobs. When you do get it working though, it's AWESOME!
@_date: 2018-10-11 19:31:07
This unit holds the RaspiBlitz you can find and build from here. [ It also holds the external drive inside! We wanted to try and make the RaspiBlitz as much as an all in one unit as we could, while also adding some customization options to it!
@_date: 2019-08-29 12:35:58
Thank you!
That's our goal exactly! To help reach the non-technical people that don't want to build their own from scratch etc.
We're huge supporters of RaspiBlitz and BTCPAYServer and we want to get them in the hands of as many people as possible.
Run your own node, own your own keys!
@_date: 2019-08-16 10:55:16
Not at all, but we run their software and absolutely love what they are doing in the space. We're definitely a part of the community though!
We want to help bring their self hosted payment processing to shops and merchants!

To be in full control of your Bitcoin, and to be a part of the Bitcoin Network. (Can have more detail if you want, but you did say ELI5)
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:31:51
The board yes if you get the 2GB version RPi4 (4GB is recommended), but not the entire system (SSD/HDD) etc.
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:16:41
We've tweaked slightly, messing with a textured bed for our PRUSA MK3S. We've found if we lower it anymore we get elephants foot which is even worse. We have smooth sheets, but everyone seems to really love the textured look given from the powder coated sheet.  
STL's are currently not available ATM.

A little bit about Build-A-Node.  
 
**Welcome to Build-A-Node.**
Here you’ll be able to customize and build your very own RaspiBlitz powered Bitcoin/Lightning Node OR run BTCPAYServer with a full Bitcoin/Lightning Node with the ability to accept cryptocurrency at your business with the payment processor!
We’ve been designing and customizing Lightning Shell Cases for over a year now, and we wanted to help users take that experience to the next level. We’ve teamed up with [LightningInaBox]( to bring full nodes to the masses!
Build-A-Node is here to help those who do not have the experience or time to put together and setup all the hardware/software on their own node.
Build your dream node today!
@_date: 2019-08-06 19:43:11
We've been working with the main Dev from the RaspiBlitz project and have released a open sourced case for the RaspiBlitz Nodes.

It's an easy way for non technical people to get their very own Bitcoin node or PoS terminal!
Our goal is to help get a node in every home!
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:26:20
We are! Https://thecryptocloak.com/shop glad you like it!
@_date: 2019-04-25 14:57:25
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2019-04-25 12:25:30
This is a Lightning Shell which is made to hold the RaspiBlitz and other Bitcoin/Lightning Nodes into one unit. We printed with Glow in the Dark filament and it turned out amazing! Figure you'd all enjoy!
Check out our other cases we've printed!

The unit has been sent out to the customer, but they mentioned they'll be sharing the final pictures! We're pretty excited to see it!
@_date: 2019-04-25 20:10:55
We have a few of everything but,
Prusa Mk3's is a great mid budget printer. $799 for the kit $999 for the pre built unit. Reliability and options are one of the best values. We can't complain with these and ours run almost 24/7
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:42:32
We love RaspiBlitz, and yes it takes a few days if you download from ftp / torrent. We ended up having to do it 3 times, but that was our own fault. XD  
Worth it though!
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:08:06
We hope you guys enjoy our new open sourced area!
The File Factory will be a place we bring projects for you to print and build on your own!
The BTCPi Case is a great way to make your BTCPAYServer hosted on a Raspberry Pi 3/3B+ look as good and it feels!
@_date: 2019-01-30 01:15:34
Absolutely, here's a link to the product page. 
Hope this help.
@_date: 2019-09-10 18:12:26
Neither, 100% should be using BTCPAYServer, worst case OpenNode and you have to KYC.
@_date: 2019-09-09 14:14:28
One of the coolest damn things we've seen in awhile. Keep building!
@_date: 2019-09-19 21:21:14
So glad you got it running! Welcome to the club!
