You might be right there.  The only thing to do is transfer the money to a savings account then transfer to your bank?
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:45:07
Yes I have, I bank and have been banking with the biggest for over 30 years.  Never had a single problem with any BTC transactions, neither have any of my friends and colleagues!!

Standby for more FUD and bullshit headlines by the BCH community!!!
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:49:53
 Makes a nice change from all the senseless FUD that has been vomited onto these forums of late!! Market manipulation at its finest!!

Spoken like true people who know nothing about Crypto!!
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:28:57
The chap who wants it to go down.....where have you been for the last couple of weeks FFS!!
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:52:52
Trouble is it's such a huge topic to try and get across to people in such a short time without ending up with a balanced argument.
God knows I'm still trying to fully get my head round it, mind you, any publicity is good publicity :-)
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:46:08
Never had a problem to be honest

Santander and Nationwide aren't proper banks, they are building societies that do bank accounts.

More FUD reporting on old FUD!!

The system will Jam up, while the price plummets and it won't be worth anything by the time you get to sell it!!
@_date: 2019-04-12 05:57:40
Yeah, tried everything.  Was all going well to that point, got a help desk enquiry pending now ��
@_date: 2019-04-22 06:27:06
All sorted thanks, they didn’t explain it very well is all ��
@_date: 2019-04-11 15:37:19
Trying to get hold of one, it says I haven’t got enough funds in my Coinbase account to cover the £4.95 card fee, despite having way more than is required!!
Any ideas anyone??
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:44:02
BTC price has a rally....the FUD starts....total BS!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:03:41
Utter FUD Bollocks !!
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:36:57
Bullshit stories to spread bad fake news to scare the week noobs into selling their coins to drive down the price.  That leaves more cheap coins for them to scoop up!!
Normally spread by Bitcoin cash wankers!!

Don't worry guys, Diane Abbot is a horses arse!!! She hasn't got a clue!!
She was told by the Leader of the shadow party to go off sick in the last election because she was an embarrassment.  
Absolute oxygen thief!!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:17:22
Unconfirmed reports, more FUD bollocks!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:31:56
The twitter FUD was largely ignored and had fuck all to do with the price, it was all bollocks!!
@_date: 2018-03-19 10:38:24
@_date: 2018-02-11 16:58:26
Not unless it starts getting a move on from this limp phase we're in right now!!
It's like watching paint dry ��
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:44:49
I'm not being funny, but wasn't  Bitcoin a western developed idea?
If you live in a communist country (regardless of how liberal China can be) isn't that just part of the regime?
Bitcoin was designed to be borderless and free, that goes against the communist ethos surely??
Perhaps that's what the Chinese communist party are scared of?

Why do people bother, I have read so many predictions lately that are wrong it beggars belief.  
Crypto is crashing because of FUD, weakness, Chinese greed, along with the stock market.  Just ride it out and wait :-) 
No-one can predict what is going to happen with fancy triangles :-)
Just saying like ����
