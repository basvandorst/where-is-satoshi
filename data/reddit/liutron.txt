To clarify I meant capital gains, but losses are excluded.
"Any gains realized by a person buying something with a crypto currency are taxable and must be reported to the IRS. And, under the logic of the Internal Revenue Code, any losses may not be deductible if the transaction was personal in nature."
This is from 2017, I don't know if the law has been updated since then but I assume it has not.

Yes. You think the US government is going to let you buy BTC at $1, buy whatever you want when BTC is $20,000, and not tax you? Conversely, if you bought BTC at $20,000 and drops to $1, and spend it on a burger, you can't take a capital loss on that because it's a purchase. Aren't US crypto laws great? /s
Edit: Yea under current tax laws, you'd still have to find a way to pay the USD on your tax return even if all you had was cryptocurrency or until IRS accepts BTC 1 day? But wouldn't paying the USD with BTC on your tax return be a taxable act?

Under current US tax laws, you have to pay capital gains on your bitcoin purchases.

I spent 30 minutes and can't find my source anymore on using bitcoin to buy goods/services and capital gain/loss ..... so....
Edit: Found it finally

I don't believe there's a threshold at this time, but there was talk of it awhile ago, but don't believe that IRS tax law has gained any traction since.

They could insure your BTC amount and pay out in BTC value.
For interest, they could pay in local currency interest rates and give you option of receiving in BTC - fees to obtain.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:42:44
Is this insured?
If anything goes wrong, will they compensate you with local currency or BTC?
Interest paid in local currency or BTC?

Yea that would have been fun if it was added in as an Easter Egg.
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:47:39
Oh... maybe I asked the wrong question. I was only trying to figure out how much 1 BTC is worth that hasn't moved since Aug 1, 2017 based on all the forks so like the total value of BTC, BCH, BCH SV, Diamond, Gold, etc.... And maybe a graph of its value.
@_date: 2019-04-23 20:30:28
Well everyone's portfolio under 60% USD BTC value is heading that way!

Maybe only have to do it when the price drops since the last time you check? haha 
At least when it's a bear market, you'll be buff. Bull market - rich!
@_date: 2019-04-24 03:37:46
I did that speculating last year and due to the bear market no one got lucky. Maybe we're sliding out of the bear market now, but BTC dominance is still increasing. Yep always a bumpy ride in one direction!
Always be the first to jump on the bandwagon! After all your friends jump on, jump off!

Same. To be fair that's almost every non-BTC coin right now.

Spoiler, sort of. Was just contemplating how the scene should have went.

Offtopic: But I used to play the Atari Pengo game! Was great! Way to screw up Pengo's good name!

I was thinking the same thing. So was the Zombie one!

In the US, we need to pay sales tax on top of everything bought on eBay too. This would have been cool years ago. eBay is struggling to remain relevant today.

If someone else transfers from your bank account that is an unauthorized transfer and banks will help you get your money back after you notify them. Also transfers aren't instant so that will work in your favor. It won't work all the time, but it's enough deterrent that hackers would rather steal BTC than digital USD.
@_date: 2019-05-18 06:27:10
I was thinking that too.... and forgot what the price is now. Then had to do some math in my head when he said 0.8.
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:52:45
That's what I thought too.... now I just checked their stock price it's been trending upwards for the last 10 years! Sure it's not as great as Amazon but.... I thought it would be down.

SMS is fine as long as it's protected from sim hacking. If not sure, use Google voice, land line phone  or don't use it at all.

Your authenticator app is tied to your phone. But if you somehow could not access your authenticator anymore there will always be a way to regain access to your account again by verifying account info. Then the question is will the hacker have all this info? Basically you never want to be put in that situation. Don't ever use your personal cellphone # or a phone # that can be found anywhere online for crypto 2FA.

Oh didn't know that. Good to know.
