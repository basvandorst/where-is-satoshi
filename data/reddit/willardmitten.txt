mine just came in! my instawallet is now showing the correct balance :)

That's normal. Instawallet is a shared wallet. Your money gets pooled, and your available balance is assigned by the server. Obviously they're having some technical difficulties over there

my first transaction too. don't worry- i'm sure this will sort out. be patient! 
edit: mine just updated to the correct amount. :)

I've got green arrow 79 and red 72. Sounds like we are definitely in the same boat. What did support say? They haven't gotten back to me. 
Also, I did a few of those free bitcoin sites yesterday, those deposits hit and were also shortly followed by withdrawals, leaving my account balance at 0.

hmm having the same issue as you.
my deposit (green arrow) is showing 41 confirmations. the withdrawal (red arrow) 34 confirmations. not showing any balance. the withdrawal of the equal amount I deposited came shortly after I deposited it. about an hour. any luck with yours? I'm hoping I still have my currency...

I haven't heard from them yet. Sounds like you had better luck haha

Ahh I messaged Instawallet. Still no reply. 
Found [this]( I don't think we're alone in this issue
