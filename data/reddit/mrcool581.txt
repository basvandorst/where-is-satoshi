Or you could just vote. That's how she got there first.

I'm not saying they cannot be done, I'm saying all it takes is an opportunist like Andrew Ryan use this system to rise to 'unstoppable' power within the early stages and as you say, with no room for radical change, people get screwed in a bad way.

We only appoint euphoric gentile sirs with a very high iq like me, get rid of religion, and make it so the are no people of average intelligence that couldn't pick the true leader of this false democracy! WAKE UP SHEEPLE!!

I've seen some bad ideas, this is by far one of the worst. Right off the bat, most countries and organizations will not recognize a man made structure on the sea as a sovereign nation. Then what about food, water and other necessities? Problems happen. Someone will control it. Another problem? Getting random people from the world to lead based on their language. Sure it may start out ok, but some how, someone will seize power and fuck over everyone. Then who's job is it to clean up? Not your floating science project, it will be the UN, NATO or just the United States.

Depends what you're fighting.  Fighting evil is worth it.

The money isn't physically mad into that, its spent again. Hell, I don't like most those people any way so that's fine.

It's not like that money is burnt. It also goes to the economy once again

In a vacuum where war's negative effects are lessened. I know war isn't a good, go to thing, but if a country has a faulty economy, war might help.

Well from a purely economic standpoint, winning a war is the best option.

I said earlier

I mean, Assad and Saddam aren't the best people around. 
I suppose hitler might have been a victim of this too? That's one of the more evil I was talking about

Look we've made mistakes, we've also done good in the world.

Looks like it’s almost time for me to buy
