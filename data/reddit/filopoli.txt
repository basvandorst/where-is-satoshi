You need to know that people know its not the real thing.
I have bitcoin on my own wallet, but some bitcoin I also want to have in revolut to actually use it.
That's the same reason you have some money in your bank account. To pay your bills. 
You can also go around an scream, withdraw all your money from your bank it's not yours, only use cash...
Bitcoin in own wallet savings account. Bitcoin in revolut spending account. 
Get it?

It's not scary it's how it should supposed to work, but a lot fast, you have to pay the price. This is the bitcoin big money self defense in the only one real free market. Big money in and out easily detectable. That's how it should be. Big money can't play with bitcoin, that's why they hate it. End debt slavery, buy bitcoin. For your child. For the next generations. Buy buy buy buy as long fake money can get real money. Avoid spending btc as long as possible. Buy buy buy. Google kalgeri plan
@_date: 2019-09-21 04:04:49
