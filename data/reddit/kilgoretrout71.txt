Please dispense with the exasperated tutor routine. If you have problems explaining things to "people such as myself," which in this case means a middle-aged man with a postgraduate education, then by all means I encourage you to continue your efforts to improve.


Yes, and it's telling that they replaced the failed currencies with *other* fiat currencies. Because the failures weren't an inherent feature of the fiat *concept,* but rather the influences tied to those currencies.
And why do you have such a difficult time with analogies? To say "fiat currencies have a 100% failure rate" is *analogous* to the statement that "the human body has a 100% failure rate." I don't have to separate "humans from fiat," whatever the fuck that means, because I never tied the two together except in the form of an analogy. How about this: boats have a 100% failure rate. There you go. No humans were harmed in this analogy.

No, it doesn't, because
a) it hasn't happened to the ones that are currently in use, and
b) even if it were a foregone conclusion that it would, the statement itself is rather meaningless in almost any context.
Like I said, the human body has a 100% failure rate by the same logic. Does that mean that human bodies are therefore shit, or in some other way deserving of being dismissed as a "failed experiment"? Of course not. Dicks have a 100% failure rate too, so should we stop using them to fuck?
Fiat currency has a 100% failure rate the same way that everything with the exception of perhaps hydrogen has a 100% failure rate. It's a meaningless thing to say.

I never said that fiat currencies didn't fail. I said that using the statement that they have a 100% failure rate is meaningless as an indictment of the concept. So no, I didn't "realize I was wrong" because I wasn't wrong and never contradicted myself.
I can see now that your difficulty isn't limited to explaining things. This is where my train stops. Good luck!

No. It implies nothing whatsoever about what countries want. It's a statement about the usefulness of your claim that "fiat currency has a 100% failure rate." As I pointed out elsewhere, boats also have a 100% failure rate. You might say "well, that's a rather meaningless thing to point out." And if you did, you'd be correct. And I'd feel a little silly at that point to say in response "This implies that boat owners don't care about their boats," because it does nothing of the kind. 
Boat owners can care about their boats *and* find the statement that "boats have a 100% failure rate" meaningless because the two things aren't mutually exclusive. A more useful thing to discuss would be the factors that influence the serviceability of boats and how they can be controlled. You might want to focus on flying if you don't like boats. That's fine. But keep in mind that airplanes didn't put boats out of business. And they, too, have a 100% failure rate.

Self-driving? I'm in. (Or not, as it were. *snort*)

Could you elaborate on this "100% failure rate of fiat"? I'm willing to accept for the time being that there may be some gap in my knowledge that, when properly taken into account, lends some measure of credibility to that statement. But on its face it strikes me as absolute horse shit.
Are you contending that because fiat currencies either fail or get replaced, and because the only ones that haven't failed or been replaced are the ones we're using, fiat currencies therefore have a 100% failure rate? Because that's a pretty meaningless set of criteria if you're interested in assessing fiat usefully. I mean, the same reasoning can be used with the human body. Human bodies indeed have a 100% failure rate. So good for us--we have a meaningless rhetorical device. You know, brains have a 100% failure rate too. So what are you doing about that?
