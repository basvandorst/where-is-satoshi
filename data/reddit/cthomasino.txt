That would devalue the currency...the whole purpose of the currency is decentralization.

Or convience, the core of the supply demand curve is convience.
We drive cars because they are more convenient than horses.
We use email because they are more convenient than letters.
We use light bulbs because they are more convenient that candles.
Crypto currency as a form of payment is far more convenient than paper currency.
If it could be made where it is as secure as paper currency, and easy to use its value would yo "to the moon".
No whale could stop it.

My theory on that is, if banks started buying bitcoin on a mass scale prices would go through the roof and the value of the total amount of bitcoin would eclipse the total value of fiat currency in a short amount of time ultimately preventing the banks from buying any more bitcoin.

It's always a good time to buy but we should be reminding vendors to accept bitcoin
