So chances would be that you could make an altcoin with a partial adoption. We had that before.

Considering the ability of the banks today to blacklist villains, I have a hypothetical question:
Imagine a future with Bitcoin being mainstream.  One of the early adopters of Bitcoin looses his mind and decides to create a dystopian world with his 20% share of the Bitcoin market.  And, he's good at hiding, so no army can stop him.  How do you prevent him from using Bitcoin for his plan?

It's hypothetical.  Imagine that the one would plan something with the recources that You would want to stop him, as well.

I would like to figure out for myself if I should support bitcoin or not

Could you be more specific?  What measures should the society have prepared so such a scenario doesn't happen?

Is it possible that there already were big whales like that but spread and anonymized their coins to different wallets via monero exchanges?
@_date: 2019-07-06 05:48:28
That's not what the system does nowadays. No, you don't get that.

Let me criticize social security then: How is this not theft?

Invest only what you can afford to loose, On your place, I'd put in some 2/3 and with the rest, I'd invest into education, and into some green projects, as well. It's on you.

You seem not to have grasped growth and development of first world countries. There could be Japanese style stagnation without migration. A  lot of individual migrants are exceptionally benefitial to the whole earth, as well. Taking care of migrants is a virtue well worth it, at the end.
I must add that this BBC shot is bro science. It's always the same source of made-up data, guesstimates and incompetence for the subject. 
@_date: 2019-04-08 11:08:34
Browse for data on migration, instead of diversity. OECD and world bank for example are good sources, though I'm sure you can look for other sources, as well.

If you have a crisis period, where the productive have to bear the burden of reconstructing the value of the fiat money, blame it on animal spirits, the populist magic works every time.

True. Though, the ones who used the gold standard, thrived more, and the powers using unsound money can't compete even now.

Know your stuff and read The Bitcoin Standard and Inventing Bitcoin

Looking at Wikipedia on Putnam, it seems that he would more likely agree with me. Thanks for the suggestion, I'll read some of his work. May I suggest you to read Das Book On Growth And Development?
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:06:39
Yes I will

Banks are allowed to loan fiat money they don't physically possess. And it's a lot of money.
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:49:06
More money will be printed, thus it will loose some of its value again, so all of us will own less value in form of fiat money as a result, though it's not the failure of all of us. Basically, someone in the future will have to pay terrible costs for the inflatory Keynesian economists' invention of fiat money.
