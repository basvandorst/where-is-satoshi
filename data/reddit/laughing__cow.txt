Which the community had the option to agree to or not. It so happens that the majority (incl developers, projects) agreed with path. Some people didn't and thus ETC. Bitcoin has its own leaders and influencers. You may agree with aantop but does that mean he controls your mind?

Code will always be code. But that's all it is. A system is nothing without people. Bitcoin is a decentralized system that is meant to align various actors towards a desired outcome via its incentives and disincentives  - the developers, the miners, the users.... There will never be *no* people.

There's the joke of the statistician who drowned crossing a river that was only 3 feet deep "on average".
Your price targets and appreciation may well be met in the long term, but markets don't go up in even measured steps in between. You will have draw down years, sideways years and short periods of spikes. Even if say your 10 year projection was correct, you don't know the topology of what happens in between. And that's what can kill you.
If you had bought at say $15 in the beginning of 2011 and waited two years your % increase would have been off the charts. You can put that on your report card and people would say wow a XXX% return for 2 years. True. But that increase is not a steady diagonal line up. In fact you would have spent a whole 2+ years down with almost a 90% loss first *before* you saw your return.

Systems that are anti establishment/decentralized are meant to be resistant to that. If a system can't survive attacks then it's not robust enough or anti fragile. Nature's a bitch and there will always be enemies.

Maybe he's a troll but he has a fair point. There's always a very vocal push to want merchants to accept btc. We have been here before. We've seen the hype Ex microsoft, overstock, that subway franchise in philly... but when it does happens it has never been sustained. There's a spike in the beginning as fans show support. And then gone. You'd be very lucky to get 5%. The initial, very loud push has been immensely disproportionate to the final sales. I think that's all he's saying and I think that's fair, judging by history. Maybe this time will be different who knows - but I have my doubts.
I agree with you however- def nothing wrong with having an additional payment method and that will help with awareness. I personally just have tempered expectations re the final numbers.

Ive hodled Btc since 2011 and eth since ico. I hodled btc through the crash from $30 to $1 and eth through the dao. There's only a few things/events that would make me sell either asset.

What the hell are you talking about? Not the same author.   And please don't tell me the name Jeff John Roberts looks remotely close to "Timothy B. Lee".
