I don't think you are considering all the implications. It's not that simple.
You may individually choose to stop paying taxes. But if you ever expect bitcoin to be truly meaningful, you need wide adoption by more, larger companies who DO PAY TAXES.
The IRS' decision makes accepting bitcoin an incredibly complex tax issue for companies, which means accepting bitcoin potentially just got very expensive for them. 
The net result is potentially a significant slowdown in adoption by any businesses operating in the US.

I agree with this philosophy in principle. But don't your think the IRS' recent declaration that bitcoin will be taxed as property dramatically limits the growth potential?
I bought for the first time at $830 for similar reasons, so the recent price drop doesn't matter to me. But I am deeply concerned that the taxation decision may severely limit bitcoin long term.
I suppose this puts the growth of bitcoin in the hands of countries outside of the US.
Am I thinking about this incorrectly?
Edit- clarified my concern better.

I'm not worried about being taxed. I'm concerned companies will be reluctant to accept bitcoin because of the tax burden on them and subsequent management required, especially if transactions started occurring in high volumes.
But who knows, perhaps it won't be an issue.
Right now one section of the government says bitcoin is property not money, but another says money transmission laws apply. So something has to give.
