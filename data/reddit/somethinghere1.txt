This isn't even the real Satoshi. Look at the emails. One from the REAL Satoshi:
And one from this poor guy Newsweek found:
Obviously the first email from the real Satoshi is very well written and they are not the same person. Which is a good thing.

Here is more proof against Newsweeks outlandish claim

An email from Newsweek's Satoshi: 
They are not the same person. Story debunked.

I'm pretty sure he used the correct one.

Also, Newsweek is starting to print magazines again. Sounds like a good idea to publish something outlandish to get sales up. From the author's twitter: 
Proof this is not the real Satoshi.

I just started watching that movie. It seems VERY intersting so far. The guy mentions in the video that the Federal Reserve is privately owned and for profit. So I do a google search for "who owns the federal reserve" and the first link points to the federal reserves faq from their own website. It specifically states: "The Federal Reserve System fulfills its public mission as an independent entity within government.  It is not "owned" by anyone and is not a private, profit-making institution."
I guess they get asked that a lot ;)
Edit: I wonder how far the rabbit hole goes

It's because it is not the real Satoshi.

From Twitter last week: "Leah McGrath Goodman ‏  Mar 3
Thrilled  is going back into print this week and excited to be working with a team of writers whose abilities astound me every day."
They are going back to printing Newsweek magazines so they came up with some bullshit story to sell more. There is no evidence in this article. Hell, I can show everyone evidence it is not him. Just look at these two emails. They are not from the same person. Shame on Newsweek and this reporter.
