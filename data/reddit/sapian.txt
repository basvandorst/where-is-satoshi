Why do people buy gold when markets tank? Because they print money like there is no tomorrow, your fiat will always decrease in buying power the longer you hold onto it. 
I view Bitcoin as having all the advantages of gold but it's digital so it's incredibly easy to trade with.
So with that yes it goes beyond just replicating existing services, it's superior to them.

I'd say it has time and time again proven itself, it IS the digital currency of the digital age, the slow cautious adoption is actually a good thing for the currency it's not a bad thing.

It certainly was, when you try to do it yourself it's actually kind of hard to really demonstrate massive sums of money.
The money taken was so large it set the U.S. AND much of the worlds economy back 20+ years, it made a massive dent in crushing the middle class down into lower class, it prevented millions upon millions of americans from owning a home, and the real tragedy is almost no one is the wiser because again it's hard to demonstrate just what and how much was actually stolen from the american people.

A commodity is any valuable resource or more accurately, a marketable item produced to satisfy wants or needs. 
Since bitcoins are finite not easily dupe-able digital versions of currency, they are valuable and marketable.
Yes, bitcoins resemble gold more than anything. There is only so much gold in the earth, and it is not a easily duped material, same holds true for bitcoins.
Dogecoins on the other hand are more like traditional currency, as they can continually be produced. i.e. printed like money.

It does in a way but think of it like this.
If I were to rob someone and take everything they had in their bank account they would be pissed and do everything they could to get it back. But if I were to rob their future, crush the economic reserves and put a strangle hold on prosperity on a global level, the majority hardly notice what's being taken from them because they don't see it first hand. You can hardly get that across to people without them glossing over or them saying well there is nothing I can do about that. That's all I meant.

Soundcloud is actually pretty big and well known in certain demographics.
The thing is everyone wants or predicts revolutions with Bitcoin when in reality it's really a slow yet steady evolution.
Fans have asked for ways to support artists more directly for years and bit by bit it's happening. I think in 10 to 20 years I see this becoming much more prevalent in the music world.

I disagree.
Licensing, allows the government to feel authoritative over something they shouldn't. I don't think a lot of things should be free market but Bitcoin definitely should. It should remain 100% user maintained and supported, that is exactly what it was designed for and it does it much better than most anything else.
Progress will come with or without government involvement, it's false to think government is needed in this.

I agree for web stuff.
For advertising in stores, etc. the ฿ or B with 2 lines, doesn't matter which to be honest, is great for capturing the attention of new users as it actually look like a currency symbol, it instantly makes you think - money. On the other hand if I were new to bitcoin and I saw Ƀ [the b with the horizontal strike] I would have no idea what it meant.
This then is a no brainer to me at least.
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:00:33
The ฿ makes me think of currency, the other doesn't.

You left out the most important part, "in an abstract way"
Money gets things done.
For example, I could use my own energy to build a boat or I could use my store of energy to have someone else who's better at building boats build one for me.
If I use my own energy to build a boat, I have a boat albeit a shitty one most likely.
If I trade someone my energy thru a mutually agreed upon currency, in this case Bitcoin, I've use my store of energy to create incentive for someone who is better skilled to build a boat for me.
Currency is merely the medium thru which I traded my energy with someone else.
Of course you've heard the saying, "time is money". Well what is our time worth? Our human time or labor time = energy
I traded some of my time(energy) for something I'm skilled at to someone else for their time(energy) for something they are skilled at.
Is it a direct store of energy like a battery? No, that is what you're talking about. I'm talking about energy in a more abstract sense, human energy.

So did Reddit until they made a night/dark mode. 
Edit - *Frizbee has a dark mode but it definitely needs improving.

Isn't that how new things start?
@_date: 2015-07-19 04:55:53
Basically the same thing is it not?
Currency is a store of energy though, it's just that its value is determined by the market so the return power gains from cashing in or spending can fluctuate which could be good or bad depending.
It is an energy storage, it's just in an abstract way but accurate none the less.
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:20:12
I agree. So far Voat has said they give you control and won't interfere but that's how nearly every social site has started until they need to make money or they get bought.
I like the idea of Frizbee, decentralized servers might actually help prevent needing to appease advertisers and how people can actually host their own server, that seems pretty cool. It seems like the next step in social networking, if they can pull off the tech. And then the next challenge of course with any new site is getting people to migrate and create the subs and content that takes time.
@_date: 2012-08-23 00:22:48
I'm curious, I haven't used bitcoin but I've been subscribed to this sub for a while because I find the news of bitcoin interesting and I wish the new type of currency success.
But isn't the primary reason people like bitcoin is the anonymous factor involved when using it and isn't a debit card defeating that benefit?
@_date: 2012-08-23 01:45:42
This makes me want to invest in bitcoin even more now. I can see the value in diversifying your assets.
I think the only thing holding me back if the technological hurdle, it's hard for me to know as a layman, how do I get started, how do I protect against fraud and how to best understand the pro's and con's of bitcoin?
@_date: 2012-08-23 01:18:34
Investment and offline storage make sense but what is non-fiat?
@_date: 2015-04-13 00:37:26


Is there a good review of the pros and cons of wallets like these? I would like to invest in more bitcoin but this list of wallets does almost nothing for me as a novice.
Seems Mycelium is highly praised here but no one explains why in detail. And when visiting Mycelium i get no information on how it really works and how I can trust the technology.
Is there a good review that shows me maybe the top 5 or 10, what exactly they can do and not do, how they are secure or unsecure, and the benefits over other technology, for example Coinbase, Circle or cold storage options?
@_date: 2015-04-17 07:01:53
Criticism and trolling are 2 different things and I think that's the point the OP is trying to make and I fully agree with.
I'm subscribed to many challenging subs, but none are even close to having the amount of trolls this place has.
If you challenge a post with good points or alternative ideas, awesome I fully welcome that, I think many here actually do. If you're mocking supporters, calling them fools or just generally pissing in the pool, you're a troll.

Holy crap, I'm completely new to Bitcoin. After watching most that video I just assumed you had to use a site for holding your bitcoins. And now after reading your reply, I'm completely bafffeled why anyone would trust a site or site-owner with what seems to amount to cash.
Anyone can setup a site, let to run for a while so it seems legit, and then decide to close up shop and run, ..and you'll never find that person.
WHY in the hell did anyone trust a site instead of their own machine? That makes absolutely no sense to me..

Well he was a victim, but it seems he was a victim of stupidity more than anything.

Isn't human intervention better when done in a group consensus of sorts versus one man crusades? The ole 2 minds are better than one, jumps out at me here.
And I think the brilliance of Bitcoin technology is it's inherent democracy of trust built into it; decentralized versus the corruptibility of centralized control, which oddly enough is exactly what you're doing, going against the ethos of this technology in hopes of bending its will in your perceived favor.
The ego of thinking one man's clout should supercede the group's evolution is an egotistical mistake, that so many have tried to point out to you. This isn't a crusade this is about ego, and no good will come of it.

Well said.
It is a bit challenging to put in ELI5 format and this also just illustrates why it works so well, stealing from the masses in obvious tax hikes would make people livid, but print endless money and weaken the value of the dollar substantially, so much so in fact, that we've essentially pushed our middle class into poverty, and hardly anyone bats an eyelash, because they can hardly put 2 and 2 together.

Why would anyone savvy enough to use bitcoin pay for wireless?
99% of them already have wireless/data plans.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:32:53
Let me go back a bit. You said,  "internet access doesn't work everywhere". For most people it works where they need it and wifi doesn't work everywhere either.
"isn't fast enough".
3g and 4g, 4glte, are plenty fast.
"And is too expensive."
Yeah but data/cell plans are mostly bundled. And anytime I want or need to use public wifi I just find the nearest Starbucks or McDonalds and use theirs for free.
I'm not gonna turn off my data plan unless somehow this service was everywhere and much more cheaper than what I already have, I fail to see how you would accomplish this. Unfortunately I think this is a grandiose idea that you're failing to see what you're really up against.

It pains me to see how this guy and others are so easily duped by this ponzi scheme.
He just doesn't get it.... Just tell him, if we ourselves acted as the Treasury and Fed. reserve, by loaning out IOU's with interest we would be arrested and thrown in a deep dark hole to rot.
The video, poor wording and needless pandering in some parts aside, is entirely accurate.
We the people are locked(born) in a interest race economy, meaning inflation will outpace most peoples net gains, so this means the majority of people have to work most of their adults lives, and the end will have little to show for it. They won't own a home, they won't own land and they won't really own much else, yet they will work 40+ hours every week.

That's part isn't too bad, it's just another way to word that banks get to loan out on a 9:1 ratio of whatever we put in.
What is important is the government and the banks get to create gains out of thin air, we on the other hand have to trade our time/talent for it. In other words, we the people will always end up being in debt and needing creditors to "loan" to us just to stay afloat.

Yeah weaps can be bought, but they also get randomly given to you, so most people don't buy the weaps. It's the hats,effects and clothing that are valuable because they can only be bought or crafted.
I have no idea about cards as I dont bother with them. But I do know you can buy a mini duel, which allows you to duel one other player once, the winner gets added to the tally board. I've won 2 duels. A duel costs $2.50. And I've gone from 30,000 to something like 90,000 place in a year. So if that is somewhat accurate that's $150,000 just in duels, but I'm sure they make much much more than that in just duels. Hats and outfits are in the several millions.
Though if you're like me I've only ever spent $20 and I just patiently collect and smelt metal to make hats for myself or I just trade other players for them. So really you don't have to spend any money if you want to and you can still have lots of items.
Because Value has allowed this the public perceives them as 'good guys' which only gets people to give them more money, it's a win win really.
*It actually is really good for preparing the next generation for virtual currency.
