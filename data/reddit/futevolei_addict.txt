Nobody is suggesting the rise from 2 to 20k occurred only due to tether.  Coinbase’ explosive growth is proof real USD entered in size.  Is your logic meant to imply X amount of tether can not cause a greater than X rise in market cap of btc?

I have seen him touting the paper that says a 30-80% fall is possible if tether is a fraud but never calling for 80% himself. I’m too lazy to check his Twitter feed for the last 2 weeks to confirm.  Anyways, I don’t mean to pick a fight.  I really just want to say I think you are wrong that a billion in tether could not have inflated it from 2 to 20.  Think of a startup going through seed rounds.  First round could value it at a billion.  Next round could value it at 10 billion.  If they only sold 100 mill worth of shares then effectively a 100 mil injection caused a 9 billion increase in market value.  A stock could gap up one day after positive earnings and increase its market cap by 10 bill.  That doesn’t mean that 10 bill of new capital flowed into the stock.  So while I don’t believe tether was responsible for the majority of rise, I do believe it possibly played a not-insignificant role.  It looks shady.  Time will tell.

They posted on twitter a screenshot, perhaps from facebook (im not on it), of two wallets that have in total ~5500 btc.  No idea whether that actually belongs to them but its a denial of a hack.  Here is one.
 
I seem to recall them having customized wallets though like 1FOXBIT3748...  Perhaps that is only for their hot wallets.  I dunno.  I have cash there and hoping this gets resolved soon.

My guess is most miners don’t have any short futures hedges in place and in fact are just dumping coins onto the market in order to pay the bills they have now.  I currently see the cme open interest total as ~3500 on the december contract which equates to 17.5k coins (5 coins per contract).  I would say that is nothing.  Coinbase will trade 40k+ coins on a busy day.  Further, the margin requirements are upwards of 40% iirc so in order to establish these short futures positions a substantial cash deposit is required.  So I’m guessing miners short on cash aren’t looking to lock up cash for several months.  It’s possible substantial hedging is done with the exchange (coinbase, Gemini...) trading desk themselves or a prop shop like Cumberland mining via custom over the phone deals.  In a dark, fragmented market like crypto it’s especially hard to figure out what people are doing.  Overall I would say I disagree with your theory.  Going a step further I would say futures have had no, or minimal, impact on btc price.

Looking at the latest COT report from November ( this is actually proven.  The commercial component (this would be miners as thy are producers of btc) of open interest totals a minuscule short position of 251 futures.

Hmm.  I thought China banned all crypto exchanges?  Are they doing this in Hong Kong?  Does it actually say they are shorting futures or shorting btc?

First point is valid.  Second point...that is not how futures work.
