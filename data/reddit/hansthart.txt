Only thing of your list I did not do, is via Twitter. Will do that right away, thanks. But until now, zero response of support, zero success in resetting the password.
Would you suggest a better and more stable exchange for fiat and coin exchange?

No I am verified and the deposit is received. Just can’t login anymore and do not receive any support. So I cannot get to my money anymore
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:55:40
Well, they are not giving any support to me and I cannot get to my money. Just a fact. Happy it’s working for you, but not for me

When can I expect a solution? Because now I have just received a standard email, saying you are busy solving it and have to follow all steps bla bla bla. Standard Helpdesk text.
I need concrete help and would like to know when I will get it??!

And still, no more help and replies from support. Like I said, it’s one big scam. Here on Reddit trying to play the good helpdesk rep, asking for a number, and then a standard email, with no help at all. Such a hoax.

Happy for you it worked. Just not for me unfortunately it seems and now I cannot get to my money
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:24:01
Yeah no shit
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:15:27
Well, my money is deposited and they have confirmed per email, so I guess I have held my end of the deal. No scam here. Now they just have to deliver and give me access to my verified account and my money.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:56:05
Then they should support me
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:59:44
And you assuming I had forgotten my password doesn’t make you an expert. Hillarious indeed.
I’ve got all my ducks in a row, they just won’t make it work. And that can happen, but then help each other to get it right again and I can start trading. If you offer support, then deliver support

Nope, nothing fucked up my friend. All done step by step as directed and all confirmed and verified by the system of kraken. So yeah, I am for real. Question is, are they?? Because no one is answering my support requests, also not here on Reddit.
Time for them to prove they are real
