Technically both are full nodes, the distinction is if its a listening node or not

It is correct, I never suggested you close it after one transaction, that would be utterly moronic. Of course you keep it open for multiple transactions. Opening a lightning channel is akin to loading up your steam wallet with cash so you can buy games in future without needed to get out your credit card every time. But it is true that over the lifecycle of a single normal channel you need 4 on chain transactions. And if you want to spend your coins elsewhere outside that channel you would first need to close it.
My suspicion was that you could reload but didn't want to commit to it since I wasn't sure, thanks for the confirmation.

Mate, ive been active in the community since 2013, have brought dozens of people into it, advocated and educated about bitcoin to possibly hundreds of people over the years, i am not spreading misinfo. 
99% of users do not run nodes today. The number of listening full nodes ranges at ~10k, with many of these being run on server farms or a single person running multiple at once. The number of private full nodes is ~ 5x that. So we're looking at ~50,000 people *worldwide* running full nodes. 
Coinbase alone has ~12 million users, so if coinbase was the only other usecase for bitcoin (which it isnt by far), then 99.5% of users arent running full nodes - listening or otherwise. 
Telling newcomers that they need to practically dedicate a harddrive and massive amounts of bandwidth along with waiting a week for the blockcain to download is class 101 on how to drive them away. 
You do *not* need to run a full node to use bitcoin, and tricking people who dont know any better into running them is not only dishonest (not to mention actually spreading disinformation), but bad for adoption and the overall community.  
Most people just want magic internet money, they dont care how or why it works, just that it does. If they want to learn more they'll ask those questions themselves and research it on their own. What the autists on this sub advocate for is akin to saying you cant use fiat without fully understand fractional reserve and central banking, oh and you have to run your own bank too. 
If you want the extra security/trustlessness of running a node then by all means go do that, but this was *never* meant to be the norm (and it hasnt been for a number of years), regardless of the opinions of luke-jr are.

I disagree with you on what constitutes 'using bitcoin' - to me, using someone elses node to broadcast your transaction that you created locally with your private key is hardly missing the point of bitcoin. 
If we're talking simply about people using exchanges etc where they are using actually tokens, then im inclined to agree.  
Surely even for your definition SPV nodes allow you to use "real" bitcoin? Otherwise i might as well claim that unless you're mining the block with your tx in it you are still using "probably bitcoin"

So that infographic isn't necessary wrong, but is looking at a best case example network with working large hubs etc. 
When you are opening a channel to a pre-existing node, that node has already made an on chain transaction before you to establish itself. An on chain transaction is a cryptographic requirement. However, with the case of hubs, they only need to open their first channel with an on chain transaction, after that other can open channels with them with only one additional on chain. This is the same with closing channels. 
To be honest I haven't been following lightning development recently as I believe there are other techs that do payments much better, but last time I checked they were having issues with stability and scalability of hubs - and was one of the reasons they weren't going live even though single channels were working. I'm not sure if those problems have been solved since.
One thing I didn't know which your infographic seemed to imply, you can't refund your lightning balance trustlessly, you have to go through some trusted exchange. I don't quite understand why that is.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:29:57
The fees to open and close a lightning channel are the same fees that you pay for moving coins on chain. 
So for two parties to send each other funds via lighting they need;
a) party A to make an on chain transaction with normal on chain fees to open the channel
b) same thing needs to happen for party B
c) send funds via lightning with a fee being paid off chain
d) party A makes another on chain transaction with normal on chain fee to close the channel and settle the transaction
e) party B also needs to make an on chain transaction to settle too 
So all up, a full use of one lightning channel requires 4 on chain transactions paying normal on chain fees, plus lightning off chain fees for every transaction that happens off chain. 
If during this process your lightning balance gets low and you want to top it up, im unsure if you need to close and settle the channel and open a new one with more funds or if you can just use a single on chain transaction to top up a pre-existing channel

Bch and btc 0conf are different. Btc has 'upgraded' with RBF which kills 0conf. Previously the older tx was the valid one, now RBF makes the most expensive tx the valid one regardless of time. So while previously 0-conf was 'safe enough' for smaller tx (say sub $1000), today that isn't the case

you mean 4cyl, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:48:28
Are you running a full node because you want to, or did someone trick you into thinking you had to? 99% of users do not run full nodes
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:15:54
The screenshot you posted suggests otherwise. Normal use of bitcoin does not require you to download, validate, or even concern yourself at all with the blockchain.

Right, that would explain why LN needs to use segwit transactions rather than just have segwit soft-fork 
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:50:57
Is the malleability fix in 'segwit' actually the segregated witness tech or is it separate code thats just included in the software package being referred to as 'segwit'?
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:58:48
Use tools like this to choose fees based on how long you want to wait.
Currently, transactions with 1-30 sat/byte are taking 2-14 blocks to confirm. From that you can guess that 20 sat/b will take more accurately 4-6 blocks.

Almost certain i saw that post on or the new algorithm works by looking at the current post score vs average top scores for the sub so +50-100 points can get it thrown to the front page which means its certain to get at least 1000 more points.

Sorry, ive been a holder of bitcoin since $160, and a part of the overall community since just under a year prior to that - and i thought i was a late-comer. I can tell you with certainty that, up until the last year or so, this is EVERYONE'S goal. When i say everyone, i dont mean a minority of foolish users on i mean it was the prevailing narrative. It was the reason to be part of the bitcoin project. People made moon memes showing the trajectory of the estimated price of the volume  of western union, paypal, gold, and visa. People were encouraged to tell their favourite local store to accept bitcoin, we were all ecstatic when places like humble bundle started accepting it. 
There were only two goals of bitcoin back then, a) secure money away from the control of governments and central bank inflation, and b) to take down/compete with the modern banking system. Everyone was a libertarian or anarchist of some description - even the cryptographers. Bitcoin was the tech that was going to change the world, free us into an unregulated market place. In many ways, satoshi's vision was taken much further by the community, but that all dead today sadly. We used to love watching the price go up, but back then that was a signal of adoption, one step closer to achieving our vision. Today the price is all anyone cares about, fetishising being overnight riches with no want nor belief of bitcoin as a currency. Its become the highschoolers NASDAQ. 
So when i hear you and others say things like competing with paypal is a fool's errand, i hear you calling the bitcoin project a fool's errand. And before you call me a shill as i know many are already thinking reading this, i think this post applies to a vast majority of supporters of both chains, even if i think it applies to one slightly more.
Bitcoin is dead. Long live Bitcoin.

You realise that bit of paper is effectively a paper wallet right? So effectively for a hardware wallet to not be "a single point of failure" you necessarily have to keep a paperwallet. 
And you can password encrypt paper wallets anyway, or print off as many as you like, or make x of n paper wallets etc etc. There is literally no security benefits from hardware wallets over paper wallets. Im not hating on Trezors, they make life very convenient if you regularly move coins around, but your OP is outright wrong from a security standpoint.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:12:23
Only a few hours after the difficulty change the BCH fork will happen which re-targets difficulty every block

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:46:33
Exactly, the choice of whether or not to buy a trezor is a choice about if you value that convenience and user experience more than the ~$100 it costs. For me, i like playing around with paper so thats a no, but i wont shit others for owning them - unless they try and claim their trezor is magically more secure 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:41:28
Congratulations, you've discovered you can encrypt a paperwallet. That doesnt change the fact that bit of paper contains unique information which can be used to move coins from one address to another. Unless you want to claim an encrypted wallet.dat file isnt a real wallet because you still need a passphrase
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:10:54
As i suggested, it gets merged when it isnt controversial among the devs. There probably is some kind of office process as to who actually has actual physical control over it, but that isnt really informative to the general process of approval
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:48:08
Well it that case i dont own any "real" wallets. And your Tezor isnt a real wallet because it needs a PIN. Utter semantics

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:12:41
Yeah i think you;re mostly right. The problem then is newcomers telling newer-newcomers to purchase them, leading to the situation now where i feel like almost no newcomers even know paper wallets can be a thing, let alone brain wallets that take no physical form whatsoever!
I actually meant to make this post a few months ago but got distracted by all the hardforks haha
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:51:13
I dont really see the point of this post at all... 
1) Were did i mention that there should be a cap on fees? I explicitly said fees will rise until people are priced out of the market. In your example that would be the Venezuelan family willing to out pay the guy buying a coke. Yes, i understand demand and supply - and so did my OP
2) Dont quite know why you start talking about blocksize increases but in any case merely changing the max blocksize is a trivial amount of actual coding for a dev, they could do it on a lunch break. The only real work is estimating current and future network limits of bandwidth and storage growth - but you yourself are talking about a "negligible bump" so this wouldnt need to be done (1mb was an arbitrary limit nowhere near current network limits, as proved by segwit)
3) your point about fee estimation is wrong, the correction factor is people being priced out of the market, people seeing their fee estimate and baulking at the price. There maybe some complexity in estimating lower fees for non urgent transactions (looking at if the mempool is growing or shrinking, rate of growth of fees etc) but for intimidate and urgent transactions (next ~1-6 blocks) it quite literally is a case of paying more than the average fee of the last block. To think that somehow quants can stop runaway fees contradicts your very own point made in (1). 
4) the number of lower fee transactions arent growing because people dont want to waits 3 days for their transaction to clear. If it were the case, as you suggest, that this is actually because these transactions are getting into blocks at the same rate people were making new ones, then instead of a flat line we would see a clear saw-tooth pattern in the graph - and short of the occasional bump we dont see this at all, further, every single low fee bar is upwards sloping, ie growing. A *vast* majority of low fee transactions were clearly not getting into blocks - to the extent that i would say that suggesting that any notable amount were getting accepted is outright wrong or at best misleading. 
So overall, youve argued against points i havent made, and are incorrect on some of your core analysis of the data in a way that goes against the logic of your own arguments.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:59:08
I should clarify that the new BCH DAA Hard Fork that went live today will mean profitability should remain ~100% at all times due to market forces. 
The new BCH difficulty algorithm updates every block meaning the previous swings of EDA are gone. The only thing determining hashrate ratios of each chain now is coin price ratio. If the price of one coin goes up it becomes more profitable to mine which immediately increases/decreases BCH difficulty, making it more/less profitable to mine etc etc damping means that it shouldnt oscillate though, instead staying at close to 100% as possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:12:41
I dont see what the absolute level of unconfirmed transactions has to do with what fee you should be paying. 
The fee you should be paying is only relative to the fee's being paid by others so long as there are more unconfirmed transactions than can fit into a single block. Take for example someone paying in the "red" range in your picture (350-400 sat), while in the first period (nov 10-11) you can see that gets you pretty much into the next block, in the second period (nov 13) it remains unconfirmed. 
In fact, while blocks are full fees will runaway exponentially (possibly linear, didnt think too hard about this), until the marginal cost of the fee = the marginal benefit of urgency of getting into a block. Full blocks necessarily price people out of the market.
So no, people arent overpaying just because the absolute level of unconfirmed transactions is going down.

This is generally good, but id rename Exchanges to Exchanges/Online wallets and have a Con be: You literally do not have control of your coins in the way bitcoin was designed, it *will* eventually get hacked or stolen. 
Also i think you're slightly too harsh on paperwallets - though no wrong. Wallets can be printed securely in ~5-10 mins + the time it takes to set up a ubuntu live USB. I spend more time cutting them out to make them pretty. You can also print out more than one at a time with no more delay. And so long as you are keeping them in a static place (not your back pocket) and away from moisture and direct sunlight - paper shouldnt fade with a half decent printer. 
Personally i have paper wallets + a mobile software wallet with 2fa. The address is archived on the phone (ie no private key) so i can always see what i have/receive more etc. If i need to spend i just import the private key via QR code, make the transaction, then send the remainder to a new paper wallet. While not exactly the safest method (ie no air gap) the private key is online for no more than a few mins and its super convenient (30 second spend). Though moving the coins twice for every transaction is expensive with high fees so ive kinda stopped doing this (or spending coins at all really).

Core is a network of devs, there isnt any real hierarchy other than that of respect/renown. changes are proposed and discusses until their exists consensus (or at least until the proposal is no longer controversial to push), update is then pushed as a new release. 
So no one really "approves" changes. If you're asking who actually compiles and uploads the release idk, but they would get kicked very quickly if they uploaded a non consensus build. 
Someone with more insider knowledge could expand on anything i left out/misrepresented.

Agreed, though i dont think these people necessarily *cant* do these things, its more they dont want to take the personal responsibility to - and its in this sense that i kinda dont want them to be a part of bitcoin. These are the people who want someone else to do things for them, or to insure them. Hence they are the people who will be the source of political demand for government regulation of bitcoin to subsidise their unwant for personal responsibility =(
