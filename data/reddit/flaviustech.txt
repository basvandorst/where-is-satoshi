He is a tiny fish, the real whales mined bitcoins between 2008 and 2011. Only 8 millions were mined in that period.
His 30k bitcoins is a dog shit compared to the ones before him.
You are ignorant to say he's not trying to become rich after he bought 30k bitcoins with 18mil dollars.

Find a user closer to your location in localbitcoin, meet him face to face and buy like that.
Bitcoin is anything but identity hidded.
Your identity will vanish when your first satoshi will be spent.
There is a situation when you can remain annonymous and that is if you will never spend it. So it will be only pixels on a screen for you, but perfectly annonymous.

What makes you think institutions will buy from exchange?
They can use localbitcoin to buy, so the price will be unaffected.
You have to be ignorant and naive to think that smart money will buy from exchanges.
They will buy from black sources and they dump on new noob investors that buy from exchanges. They can dump millions of bitcoins. Be careful with your greed and speculation, you might get burned severe. Those who bought at 20k know what i mean :)
I don't want to sound like a flame, but this is reality my friend. Many speculators sold their homes to buy bitcoin at 20k. Now they pay mortages.

However, wallets allow you to name every wallet created.

If you would bet against this guy's predictions, you would be millionaire at this moment :) 
All his predictions since 2016 were exactly opposite then what future proved to be. I remember somewhere early 2017, he said bitcoin is gonna fall back to $200 again like in 2014, after his prediction at then end of the year, bitcoin went to 20k. At that point he said bitcoin will go to 75k in early 2018. 
Ofc after he predict 75k, bitcoin drop to 6k. then he said at the end of 2018, bitcoin will be 50k, toward end of the year bitcoin drop to 3k :), then after this drop to 3k he predicted that bitcoin will be 25k by the end of this year.......
Now guess where we will be at the end of this year 2019? I feel like i can double or maybe triple my bitcoin if i sell now and buy at the end of the year.

GB droped 25% at peak from 2016 since that referendum in comparison with EURO, i think that is more important indicator since you trade with eurozone more then U.S.
And that drop was without actually exit. If they exit with no deal, i don't wanna think about what's gonna coming, but i guess British Pound will be more volatile then my national currency which is in eastern europe.
But i can see a british pound trading even lower then EURO price in that scenario. Probably somewhere next to u.s dollar 1:1 parity. 
But there will be winner in that case, U.S.A :), and both euro zone and britain will lose.

Since i said 99.5% of coins can be a scam, i would not advice you to not exchange bitcoins at all. 
Yes, you can make 1000x gains until 1 point when you lose all 1000x in a blink of an eye.
I saw people that traded and had success and increased 300%, and they traded on Quadriga, then they lost everything.
It is a risky market. The only true value is in decentralized coins.

Judging by real use-case of btc in real world, i believe 3.7k is still a inflated price. Until use case won't magically change overnight i continue to say that price is hyped.
When i can go at local store and i can use btc instead of fiat to buy groceries i can say i am enchanted by btc and deserve a high price. But for that, we need prices to be stable.

Bitcoin core is the software name for node. Go to bitcoin.org and check yourself, the token is named Bitcoin, bcash i explained that is a copy of bitcoin ledger with low tokens volume in circulation.
Everyone is free to modify software since is a opensource software.

In some parts in china cost is under $1500.
Mining is a dynamic market. It doesn't correlate with prices. First is the price that move then miners moving accordingly, if miners are in zones that pay 3k dollars /btc in electricity and prices drop, they shutdown some machines, they won't shut down whole facility, they just reduce cost of consumption accordingly with price of bitcoin.
You can mine bitcoin at 1$ or 100k dollars with same machines. When miners starts to shut down machines, the difficulty decrease, that mean the rest of working miners will get more coins but they will worth same since the prices droped. Hope it makes sense for you.
Literraly price of btc can go to $10. The remaining miners will have low difficulty so therefore they will get instead of 1 coin/day, they get 1000 coins/day. Same rule apply for btc=10k, they start miners back, difficulty increase and they won't get 1000 btc, they get 0.1btc but will have value of 1k dollars production.

They are based on how big in bytes is the transaction. If you have a wallet with multiple public addresses and many micro transactions inputs in that wallet, if you try to send 1 big transaction composed with those inputs, the fee will be bigger because it will have more bytes of data.
Hope it makes sense.
In lighning network they are smaller because they work on second layer of nodes. It is like you would have a parallel ledger, the only job of LN is to take many micro payments and put them in 1 big file transaction which will be broadcasted on main ledger when channel close. It is more efficient way then for example you and me making 2 separate transactions in ledger, we use lighning channel to mix your tx with mine and broadcast as a single transaction on main ledger.

You have bitcoin core full node? Or how you want to show balance?
What you posted down is just an cold wallet generated in python.
The balance can be seen only in bitcoin blockchain explorer.
That is why that syntax gives error. You tell it to print balance sheet, but the wallet cannot show blockchain explorer info.
The bitcoin tokens never leave ledger, they don't transfer "physically" to your wallet.
However, there are ways to get signed tx broadcasted on network and manually add that hash info to your python wallet. But is kinda complex programming. :)

Indeed, debit cards working fast, you can send bitcoins from coinbase to a personal wallet instantly, but you need some time to wait for transaction of bitcoin to be validated by miners.
I withdraw 3 days ago some btc from coinbase, tx fee was 0.07 usd, it took like 2 hours for first 12 confirmations from miners.
Depending on your bank it might need some time to process funds. It might be different from bank to bank. But it should not take more then 24 hours from the moment you apply for sending money to coinbase.

If seed is not a private key, give me your seed from your wallet :). They match 1:1, you can reverse process, you can extract same private key from same phrase everytime. It is an easier implementation to convert from ugly numbers of private keys to a entropy. Is easier for humans to memorize those numbers in a easy way. Every private key can be converted to seed, you get alphabetical chars from it instead of numbers.

There will never be a perfect system, we just need to improve the actual systems.
In last communist countries remained, bitcoin is a way better solution.
For us the need of such a system is less demanded.
I disagree with your statement and thinking of how bitcoin miners power works.
Those miners are spreaded all over the world, they are congested into pools. They can switch pools at any time they want.
You cannot organize a 51% attack since nodes/pools can be switched so fast.
As long the nodes can be made freely, a 51% attack it is almost impossible to be realized. 
If someone tries the loss for them are insanely huge. If they manage to control each individual asic miner machine.
At this moment btc pool have a big portion, but you have to keep in mind that miners from all over the world is connected at that pool.
They can switch pool in literrally less then 5 minutes.

Same can do many investors, they can buy from somewhere else other then exchanges, so the prices will be unaffected. Don't trust in those numbers, buy bitcoin and never exchange it back into fiat. This is best advice you can get.

If one big exchange like "let's say Coinbase" will be enter in a inability to pay for bitcoin sellers, will have a domino effect. Because many small exchanges like the ones in my country, are tangled to big exchanges like Krakken, or like Quadriga :), then we can see blood on the street. When speculators realize they cannot sell their shitty coins, because exchanges will have 0 fiat in banks sheets accounts, that is for me a blood on the street.

If you use localbitcoins you find the user that selling and meet him face to face, you cannot get more instant then that, you give him fiat and he sends you btc.
Sepa payments works faster on bitstamp. I cannot tell ya how fast is at this moment. But it should be really fast, especially if you have sepa payments on your banking in Europe. No, when i use sepa account and send it to another account with sepa compatible, is faster then bitcoin itself, it should not take longer then 5 minutes to be processed. But make sure your banking have enabled sepa payments. Many banks try to disable that option so you gonna end by paying high fees at money transfers. U.E have reglemented and imposed banks to enable sepa payments by default, but many banks try to avoid that payments. When you transfer through sepa payments in U.E , fees should be less then 1 Euro.

It is possible. However the timeframe it looks too fast, in last 3 dips the timeframe was longer at last dip then the one before, i think in 2022 we can see above 100k prices. but maybe in 2024-2025 we gonna see that 270k

You should be thankful to your bank, mine sent an letter to announce me that they blocked my bank account due to suspect transactions with exchanges involved in crypto.
Basically they said usual excuse "money laundry" :) . Unofficial a friend from that bank told me they got directives from central banks to shutdown any account that trade with exchanges bank accounts.
So, is hard to win this battle, they control gov's in little countries, they basically influence politicians to make laws to make crypto illegal in those countries. We will see if we can win this war.

Neah, you gonna see btc much more low if you would compare price in satoshi rather then in bitcoin.
When you start to say, " i can buy a lambo with 200k dollars" that today if you convert into satoshi, you will think that you pay way too much satoshi for a car.
200k dollars = \~50 btc = [5.000.000.000]( satoshi.
Yeah it sound very scary when you think that btc can be valued at 1mil or 10 mil dollars/btc.
Keep in mind less then 1% of people population used bitcoin, from those 1% only experienced I.T guys will understand in deep thinking how is working and why is so important that will be less then 5% from those 1%.
You need also have some understandings of how economy works at macro level.
I can recommend you to start by seeing Zeitgeist documentary, you can start from there and read more about financial-economics. When you have entire package of knowledge you will understand why is easy for bitcoin to go at a price of 0.25$/1 satoshi. This number is not throwed random by me. I made some estimations and some macro economics calculations and i am pretty sure that price will come in less then 40 years.

By the time reward system is finished, bitcoin is suppose to be mass adopted. That makes transactions insanely huge in volumes, more transactions=more fees in transactions that goes to miners to be kept incentivized.
But limited supply have another bigger disadvantage, it is deflationary, many that have not studied economics would say that deflation is very good.
That is true for the short term, in long term more deflation it means more people will keep coins in wallets in a hope of increasing price, that will lead to a blockage of markets, if 100% of people will hold entire coins in the hope of geting rich. If nobody spend them, then it will remain just pixels on screens with 0 usage.

Once you brute force a public key, you can generate signatures for rest of public keys holded and accessed by private key. Private key is encrypted with alphanumeric key of 256 bits.
You mistake tx encryption with private key.
The way is used in wallets to make private key is used a mnemonic phrase to be easier for users to store the key.
Between private key and public key there is a signature, only specific private key with specific sig can generate a particular unique public key wallet.

The most powerful international trading currencies.
They will return to the mainlands when bitcoin gain traction and all countries will start to use it as a instrument of trading between countries with different currencies.

It is true that also it can lucky brute force an encryption from 1 second up to 140 years.
Can you imagine? Put 400 computers in clusters 24/24 hours at maximum power to brute force an bitcoin wallet, and after 140 years of force, when it finnaly finish the cracking, to find out that wallet had 10 satoshi's in it? :))))))))

That wallet should have total of 0.31 unspent bitcoin. If you have the private key, it should display balance.
If the wallet is synced with nodes.
Tokens don't go into the wallet on your device, they never leave ledger, wallet only gives you access to funds on the ledger. Your wallet have to be online and syncronised with node/network/ledger or however you wanna call it.
@_date: 2019-03-26 02:02:03

All blockchain explorers show same results.
It might take 1h more or maximum 2h to get first confirmation.
It is better to put lower fees so you won't encourage rest of nodes to be "greedy". It is how is bitcoin core works, higher fees are confirmed first, but if all starts to increase fees we gonna end like at the end of 2017 to pay $30 for transactions if all starts to increase fees. They can literraly be $0.0006 and you will get same speed of confirmation if all users add that low fee tax.

All forks coins values will go back into bitcoin's market cap at the end.
@_date: 2019-03-27 13:37:21
Bitcoin cash have his ledger history from bitcoin core after they forked. So, if bitcoin wallets from original bitcoin network before fork choose not to use their private keys on the wallets from bitcoin cash after fork, those coins will never be used on bitcoin cash (you can say will be permanently lost on bitcoin cash system network).
I don't remember exactly how many coins were mined at the moment of fork. But, let's say bitcoin ledger had 15 millions of bitcoin wallets, if those wallets users chose not to use their private keys on bitcoin cash forked network, all those 15 millions of coins will be basically locked on bitcoin cash. So, bitcoin cash can use only those coins that were mined after the 15 millions of coins.
The oldest chain is the original one, in this case is bitcoin core.
Btw, Roger Ver had i think \~70k bitcoins, when network was forked, he could use private key from those 70k bitcoins to unlock another 70k bitcoin cash on that network, but he could still use the original 70k bitcoins from original network, i donno if he was exchanged those into bcash.
If i would had 100k bitcoins before fork and i will chose not to use private key on bitcoin cash network, those 100k bitcoins will be permanently unusable on bitcoin cash fork. It is like they duplicated network but they kept history from bitcoin.
Same it is with all forked coins,  litecoin/bgold/etc.... if the users before fork chose not to use their private keys on those forks, those coins will never be in use on litecoin/bgold/etc. They have low "liquidity" in market if users don't want to unlock the coins.

It cannot go down with spoofs, it goes down only when orders are filled. So, when it goes down it means someone sold it already. Whales put spoof orders to influence normal people how to place their orders. The spoof itself it is harmless and doesn't affect the price until that order won't fill up.

Two reasons:
1) a fork will have old ledger from main network, that makes the coins will be stuck on the main net and cannot be used on fork network if owners of those funds refuse to use private key on the new forked network.
2)  at the moment of fork, the only way you could get those new mined coins from new network is to exchange bitcoin to the new coin, that lead the value from bitcoin correlate with new coin.
Only later you could buy straight with fiat that coin. 
As long vast majority of value from forks comes from bitcoin, that will make alt coins to follow main network bitcoin's price.

Actually when prices rises is not whales with massive amounts of btc, is whales with massive fiat amounts that buy BTC. :)
Part of surge was due to exchanges from shitcoins to bitcoin, that made bitcoin price jump up and some shitcoins drop prices because all value went in bitcoin.
However was some fiat buy also part of this surge up.
After that pump, some shitcoins gained back value when pump cooled down.

To the guy who wrote the topic.
But to counter your argument "old people suck" , i'd say young millenials have 18-19 years old, they have 0 incomes, they now go to college/universities etc, when they finish and look at their wealth will be negative, so they have to work at least 5-10 years to pay loans during college.
That's my point, the guy who wrote this topic lives with his head underground i think.
The money are at old generations not to young ones.

The only one person could be catched, is the one who spend bitcoin, either by purchase goods at local store or a ecommerce, once that person is tracked, it can be asked who sent him those coins and so on, if that bitcoin is tracked or marked as a illegal activity it can backtrace entire tree of transactions till they find the guy who stole or committed an illegal act.
So, yes! In theory any thief can be catch with tracking bitcoin, once that coin will be spent.
If a thief chose not to spend coins, then i guess he will only have a nice pixel on his screen and that's all :).

It's about put it in perspective, it is impossible to calculate with 100% accuracy.
That 8x figure is a conservative number, it is much more higher.
Keep in mind, the peak of mining farms was in 2017, since then, many miners bankrupted or shut down parts of farms.

Also count all customers who have to travel at their building.

There was some darknet users that mined also, but that was low quantity gains.

The ideea is to concentrate all individual tx and broadcast them as a single tx on main blockchain ledger, that way you free up a lot of hashing power in the main network.
Yeah. LN can be a bit centralized and less secure, but that is build only for small funds keeper.
Imagine in the future, you get your monthly salary in btc on main layer, then you transfer as a pocket money to LN, to make micro payments and daily tasks.
Or, think at main layer as a vault where you store your savings, and LN you use for daily tasks payments of bills/online purchase/convenient store payments etc.

I think it has something to do with setup for fees, it shouldn't take satoshi from wallet when you set 0 fees, you can try add fees 2 satoshi. I donno how many tx's were routed through your node. You can try close channel and broadcast tx's and see what is happening after.
I saw someone on yt that used blue wallet and when he sent funds from ln to main ledger, ln node sent twice amount of btc then it should sent. Basically user took from node double funds. It was a missconfiguration of node. In your case is hard to know, but try get help in bitcointalk.org.

I think he's referring to channel funding, he have to support funding on whoever use a channel with his node.
The node lose funds over the time, but he need to close channel and broadcast all tx to main network, only when he close channels he get funds back.
I donno if that's his case.
Or he did not put tx fee, and all transactions might get fees from node's wallet.

You still need to get synchronize that wallet to display funds, basically to download hash of all inputs had that wallet. If you want to stay offline, you copy that data from blockhain manually and put data into the offline wallet, only then you can sign transactions. 
If you just put private key on a offline wallet, it will not display funds, it will show 0 at balance because offline = no sync

At this point the acknowledge doesn't make you rich. Money do makes you rich. So this cycle cannot be reversed, it will be always like this.

You can use function of DMZ from router, put local ip from the machine that have installed bitcoin core.
That is the simple way.
That DMZ function will enable all ports for the specified ip.

No is not about U.S or any kind of nation, is about human thinking. Most of people will wanna spend more then we produce. If is not about student loans, later is a house mortage, loan for a "lambo car". It is how most of people thinking. That combined with actual fiat inflations and greed from banks lead to economic crisis.

Well, if you buy anonymously, when you spend them, your anonymity is gone.

You are one of the few people that question of reasons of why is going up.
The vast majority never put this question. They only start to search for reasons only when bitcoin drop and never search for reasons why is going up. Good job for this :)

Maybe it is an binance exit scam. They empty their users's wallets. Because we can see how altcoins drop. I cannot explain how they drop while binance trading is off.
Too many coincidences. Bitcoin dominance goes rocketing up exactly when binance trading was shutdown.
I don't believe in coincidences, but the fact is that users of binance they will have lower value in their portfolio if not 0 :) .

I donno, i never use exchanges without disclosure or regulation. But i read some new that they will keep trading disabled for 2 weeks or smth.
Anyway i am safe, i have 60% btc, 39% ethereum and rest are in some free zcash from coinbase. :)

Come on, they pretend to have traders and guarantee you 200x returns. 
Why would they share their success with you? They could get returns for themselves if they are so successfully.
They want your bitcoins :) +affiliate pyramid scheme. This is purely ponzi scheme identical with bitconnect.
Only on bitconnect they pretended to have a magical unknown bot that trade bitcoin for big gains guaranteed, here they replaced bots trading with actual human "forex traders".
If i was so successful trader, why would i share my revenue with someone? I would make money for myself.
This is the case with that site too.
