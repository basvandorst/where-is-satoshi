I just read through it and I have to say that it is a terrible deal for small investors.

They can ban it. If it is banned than you can have bitcoins but good luck spending them.

Point?

Shit, I wish they supported this last time I send them cards.

Argentina didn't lose their job or get sick.  It is so much different when it is a country.  Argentina in particular is not a country you want to defend on this issue.

It is the same as the bank giving you a stock market GIC that has a fixed top end return. 
Edit for link:

Why would you pay for it?

46 people claimed... BTC commerce is roaring ahead
@_date: 2014-01-22 04:56:17
I know, I sold you a lot last year, if I could have gotten rich if I could have gotten bitcoins back then.

"The country eventually froze bank accounts and defaulted on its debts. It has since struggled to attract foreign loans at market rates."  
This statement is truly shocking.  Lenders will not lend after you steal from them.  Tisk tisk.

There is no way they will be able to stick it to you.   If you have to, go to small claims, you will win.

The uncertainty is priced in so we might see a relief rally but if China goes further than expected and bans everything then we will see a big crash.

Oh no, he is onto me.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:49:24
Yeah really, this was the same place someone posted a link to a suicide watch website last time the market dipped 40%
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:51:21
Who the fuck would use that exchange? 
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:31:04
Oooooh snap! Shit just got real.

They can't even get people on board to make serious non-contentious  changes that are required right now.   So something like this will never fly.

Vandalism is stupid

It is the same as this product except with bitcoins instead of the stock market.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:46:27
No, that is incorrect.   Bitcoin isn't a public company so you could not have insider knowledge.   If your dad came home and said that the bank was going under and you short sold the stock then that would be insider trading.

Most will use a weighted average. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 15:19:56
You are so full of shit

It is like a contest to see which OS pisses me off the most. Right now it is Win8.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:04:41
This method is the worst....
