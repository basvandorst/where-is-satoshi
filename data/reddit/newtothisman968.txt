yes I've done it but don't put it too low. Based on the fees you should see an estimate for the confirmation time. Maybe number of blocks or wtvr
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:04:41
set the fees lower if you don't care if it takes a day or two

Do not tell anyone on the internet any information on that paper...They will be able to access the money remotely.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:37:15
you can get it back
what wallet are you using for bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:51:37
lol noob. 
you don't know...but you will learn
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:49:50
im not going to explain to you the whole process. But if you send bcash to a BTC address or vice-versa its pretty easy to recover it as long as you didint send it to an exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:11:13
It could take a very long time to process. After a week some people get worried.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:36:53
lol no
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:42:27
you can get it back using your private keys. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:37:37
lol people
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:39:27
you will give a fuck when it breaks 8k 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:40:42
Since you sent it to an address on an exchange you won't have access to your private keys (which you need to get it back). 
You will have to contact coinsquare and ask them to fix this.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:29:18
When is the expiration?
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:24:17
You are probably right. I see 8k coming soon. Thats not anything bad though. The market is super speculative right now with thousands of coins. Most have to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:53:00
wait it out. keep trying. they are the answer.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:45:29
thats not a lot of bitcoin. Not much you can do with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:48:04
Thanks for all the help! I will definitely pass on what I learned today. 
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:59:56
Use Binance and then buy some BNB so you only pay 0.05% in fees on trades. 
Theres a lot of coins you can day trade between. Just remember you are always trying to get more bitcoins!
Let me know if you have more questions Ive been doing it for a while.
If you are interested in using my referral code let me know! ill send it over haha ;)
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:35:40
Okay thanks. I was going to do this anyways just was not 100% sure. Wouldn't want to lose my coins!
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:23:28
I would say 75% percent of their users have no idea about forks. You are right, this is not stealing. But its dishonest. Companies have a certain responsibility to their customers.

If you didn't own your private keys at the time of the fork you will not be able to get it unless the exchange in which the bitcoin was on decides to support it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:06:15
Thanks! But can't you use  to get your private keys from the 12 words?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:56:43
Cant figure it out with Bitcoin.com. Going to try Electron cash wallet now. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:59:47
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:57:45
Okay so I'm going to use  to get my private keys for my bread wallet.
Then use Coinomi to import my private key to a BCH wallet?
 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:04:42
Binance allows you to day trade with like 100 currencies. Every day there are different currencies that have a lot of volume and are ideal for day trading.
Going to be hard to only day trade with GDAX and only $1000
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:55:53
They own all the private keys for everyones bitcoin at the time of the fork. So they have access to everyones bitcoin gold.... 
If they do support it they will give everyone their share of Bitcoin gold. Just like how everyone finally got their bcash last week.

@_date: 2017-12-25 04:14:43
Okay so I have my bitcoin private key now. I don't have an android so I am unable to use Coinomi. 
I downloaded the Bitcoin.com wallet but when I try to import the key it only lets me import using the 12 word recovery phrase (which I have from bread wallet).
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:33:27
Yea I have all the info for the wallet I sent it to.
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:24:19
Sorry can't send. Its a Holiday
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:43:51
I was talking about if they NEVER support it.. I understand that it could take a while, maybe a year to decide to finally support it. My issue is if BTG keeps growing in value and they never decide to support it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:07:14
Okay that makes more sense so I would be able to use  to see my private keys for all three coins?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:31:37
I bought BCH from a Bitcoin ATM and sent it to a Bitcoin wallet. I have not been able to recover the funds. If you can guide me through recovering them I can pay you $50 USD in Bitcoin. 
Let me know. Its been a couple months now.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:25:18
Yup, since your inputting the words online. I just want to gain access to my BTG so I need to get my private key. They ill just re program the ledger wallet.
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:36:08
doug polk crypto is the best by far

Anything is possible young padawan.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:47:22
I laughed 
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:47:13
LOL.... I count the money in my wallet 100 times more often than I count my fingers.
