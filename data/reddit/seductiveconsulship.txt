Wow, just wow. You clearly have exactly NO idea what you're talking about. Do you know what stock Buffet manages? Berkshire Hathaway. It is a publicly traded company. It is legally obligated to report its investments. It is arguably the best-managed company in the world over the last 40-50+ years.
There is no "secret" to his investment strategy: he prefers large cap stocks with well-known brand names that consistently produce high dividends and, more importantly, have a history of *growing* the dividends consistently. This is why he invests heavily in Coca-Cola, Exxon, Geico, IBM, American Express, etc.
He is especially well known for these two investment strategies:
1) Buy big brand name stocks when they encounter bad news and the price tanks. He reasons it will typically recover, and it usually does (see: BP, which he also invested heavily in after the stock tanked following the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster in the gulf).
2) Be greedy when everyone else is fearful. Be fearful when everyone else is greedy. Basically: you should buy stocks of something when everyone else (read: the market) is moving away from it, and you should offload stocks of something when everyone else (read: the market) is moving towards it.
Using these strategies of making a history of growing dividends paramount, followed by investing in brand names and buying when a stock begins tanking for X bad news story, he's been easily the most successful capitalist of the last 50 years. That's why a share of his company Berkshire Hathaway, is by-far the most expensive (BRK.A trades presently at $226,500/share).




He is ALSO notoriously frugal; he still drives the same crappy car he's had for 30 years and still lives in a terribly-average home he bought in the 70s.
He's also the billionaire who made the news a few years ago talking about how absurd it was that he was paying a smaller percentage of his income in taxes than his secretary (given that he pays ~15% in long term investment taxes as opposed to the ~25-35% income taxes his secretary makes). Find another billionaire who does that.

You didn't see to grasp this; yes, cloud computing already exists. However there is no incentive-based cloud-computing that would encourage people to give up spare CPU cycles aside from the goodness of their heart (aka, what folding and the SETI project's cloud computing projects are based on).
By tying in a cryptocurrency into the fold, you would be encouraging everyone to give up spare CPU cycles on their computer to solve these problems. Also, yes, I'm fully aware of CUDA having used it for many projects in the past, but it is not useful in this instance. GPUs are good at massively parallel operations (aka figuring out the RGBA value of every pixel on your screen at the same time). CPUs are optimized for performing complex calculations, the type of which you would need for applying any of the many optimization strategies. Don't take it from me, take it from NVidia:




Is gold a bad store of value? You bet your ass it is:


You know, there's a reason why no one either tries to buy things with gold or accepts payment in gold: gold is a shitty, awful currency. It's just another investment with different fundamentals than the stock market, CDs, bonds, forex, whatever.


Haha yes, you are right about "case in point". But the incentive to invest is to generate more wealth for yourself, such that you have more money to invest, such that you generate more wealth for yourself...
This breaks down with bitcoin because there's no point to invest when the deflationary nature means there is reduced / no incentive to invest. This is just basic economics.


Oh come on dude, this is just a ridiculous argument. Look at the last year of bitcoin. The price has utterly collapsed and there has been **zero growth** in terms of transactions. This means every time anyone is exchanging a bitcoin for some product/service, they are losing money (guaranteed), regardless of whether or not they immediately 'buy back in' with coinbase.
Plus, what sort of lunatic would it take to ever set up an automatic 'buy-back' with bitcoin, where your $600 may buy you anywhere from 0.5 to 2 bitcoins depending on the current MtGox/other exchange scam-bot artificially driving the price up. Well, that and the fact that probably more than 75% of major bitcoin exchanges have ended up "hacked" (read: bitcoins stolen by creator) or completely insolvent or, more commonly, both.


Who in the fuck walks around with their life savings in cash on their person at any point in time? Worst case you have a couple hundred dollars on you. **Compare this to bitcoin, where one technical mishap either by you or someone else can mean you lose EVERYTHING with ABSOLUTELY NO RECOURSE.** No recourse, I guess, except putting a hitman bounty out (which, I guess, bitcoin is useful for).
The basic fact is bitcoin is horrifically flawed. I know it sucks to hear it, but it's absolutely true. There's a good reason why 6 years on, no major companies accept bitcoin. Sure, they accept fiat via Coinbase accepting bitcoin, but that's not a major company accepting bitcoin.
Anyway the long story short is blockchain = probably useful if developed further, bitcoin = an absolutely godawful first try that should be abandoned in favor of something with actual utility.

Don't usually do a cross post but whatever. **To anyone seriously considering following this OP's advice: DON'T.**
This 'guide' is almost comically bad. The OP clearly has no idea what he is talking about in regards to compuer security. I'm going to re-post my response I just made in about this thread.
I may not like bitcoin or bitcoiners but one thing I hate more than that is peddling extremely bad computer security advice.
    [XPOST]


Wow, holy shit. There is SO much stupidity encapsulated in this one statement.
"Fucking windows" isn't keeping you from booting to an OS stored on a USB/CD/DVD, your "fucking stupidity" is. When you turn your computer on you have a few seconds to press an F1-F12 key to mount another drive (aka, another operating system on another harddrive, cd, dvd, or usb). In fact, "fucking windows" has **not a single thing to do with this.**
And using an "OLD COMPUTER" doesn't make you more secure -- **it makes you way fucking more vulnerable**. If you were using Windows XP, for example, you're a goddamned idiot because Microsoft stopped supporting it last year and now there are tons of exploits that are not / will never be patched.
**And this is the guy who thought himself smart enough to write a goddamned tutorial about computer security.**
Honestly it blows my mind that bitcoiners are so inexplicably noobish with cryptography. **It's not even like it's that goddamned hard.**
Wanna keep your private key safe? On your computer to boot?
* Take private key. Encrypt with AES-128 or better (AES-256 but there's practically no difference in terms of 'breakability'). Use a long (~30ish char minimum) non-trivial password with multiple words, numbers, and a special character or two. Just don't forget your password. Don't use anything online to encrypt with AES (many sites are honeypots for passwords).
* Keep your now-encrypted private key wherever the fuck you like. Hell, if you don't use a stupid password, you could post it on reddit for christ's sake. It doesn't matter. If you didn't use a stupid password, no one other than you will be able to break it. (**edit: just in case you think I'm joking about posting it on reddit, I'm actually dead serious. You already use this algorithm dozens of times a day -- it's the part of SSL/TLS that handles transmitting voluminous data securely between two computers**)
* If you like, buy 1 or 2 spare usbs and keep your encrypted or unencrypted key there.
* **Don't fucking forget the most important thing that every butter always forgets: DON'T LEAVE YOUR STUPID PRIVATE KEY ANYWHERE ELSE.** Create a new public/private key pair if you have to. Don't use an online generator (they store whatever they generate to steal later). Use a popular and consistently updated open software package.
* The other thing that always makes me laugh is their insistence on stupid shit like using a *nix OS. Sure, it's more secure, but at the same time it's entirely unnecessary. I use windows 7. I have my updates set to install automatically. I install my software updates as they come out. I have my windows firewall turned on. I use BitDefender Antivirus Plus 2015 (the best antivirus/malware product on the market). It costs me $30ish a year. It contains algorithms for recognizing virus/malware-like instruction sets in executables in real-time (even ones it has never seen before), and automatically quarantines and/or deletes them. Additionally, I update and run my scan at least once a day at 5:00 am and also every time I boot. I have zero malware or viruses. I don't fear being keylogged. No one is going to be taking over my computer.
* Don't open up stupid attachments. Don't even open attachments unless you are expecting them. Even if you are expecting it, scan it beforehand with antivirus (since viruses will sometimes attach themselves if your friend is dumb with computer security).
* Don't use the same password for anything important. I use 2 distinct 30 character passwords plus 2 factor authentication for my 2 main email accounts.**(edit: to emphasize this, your email is the thing you should absolutely be protecting the most -- if it is compromised, everything you use it for is compromised. Use 2 factor, no excuse)** I use other distinct passwords for my investing and banking. I also have varying tiers of lesser passwords I use based off of my judgement of how shitty a website's security is. Garbage tier get my garbage password, medium my medium. Etc.
 * Just to rub it in, DO NOT USE THE SAME PASSWORD on anything you value. I used to be big into sql injection and I cannot tell you the number of times I was able to break into people's emails based off of the password they input on some stupid forum I broke into. SQL Injection is still damned common because the vast majority of programmers are self-taught amateurs who don't have any clue how to properly sanitize parameter input.
 * edit: you should always be operating under the assumption that whoever you trust with private data is a complete and utter buffoon, even if they're not. I once extracted thousands of passwords from a phpbb3 forum that were both hashed and salted via MD5(MD5(password) + salt)). I broke approximately 50% of the passwords I collected within a week of running my own cracking program on my laptop 24/7.
* Always check to ensure before entering your password that 1) you are on the correct site and 2) you are using https 3) the certificate is trusted. When in doubt, don't fucking enter your credentials anyway.
* **edit: and one last thing to reiterate -- OP's advice is absolutely insane. NEVER use old software. ALWAYS use the latest version of every bit of software on your computer. ALWAYS update your OS when prompted to.** UPDATE EVERYTHING. ALWAYS.
Anyway reason why I felt like writing this isn't because I sympathize with the butters (I don't), but just because while they may be a mass of cluelessly arrogant fucks about computer security, they do have a somewhat reasonable point that most people don't know anything about computer security.
It's just funny to me they are also most definitely included in that subset.

This is a nice thread you created here under an alias, bro. Good shill job
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:57:26
Thanks for the reasonable response. I think blockchain technology is interesting. I think bitcoin is, much like the first lightbulb, a crappy prototype that should be replaced by something useful. Specifically, I don't think there is any way any cryptocurrency will ever become mainstream without satisfying:
* Being useful
 * Cloud computing: Instead of performing trillions of useless SHA-256 functions, solving optimization problems (e.g. on this block, we are given function f(x). Find x such that f(x) is the smallest amount possible). Also, people could put up bounties on finding the optimal solution to certain functions to ensure they get preferentially selected as the next function to work on. This would be extremely useful since a) most problems are able to be turned into optimiziation problems and b) all maximize optimization problems are able to be turned into minimize optimization problems. Think of how impossibly useful it would be to have a decentralized cloud computing network.
 * Cloud storage: Instead of performing trillions of useless SHA-256 functions, keeping a permanent stash of files available. Demonstrate you still have the correct file by hashing 1) the file itself and 2) the timestamp of the block together, encrypting with your private key, and then comparing with other nodes (who verify you created this with your public key). Think of how impossibly useful it would be to have a decentralized cloud storage network.
 * Disincentivizing ASICs: another bonus of the above cloud computing would be that ASICs would be useless. Even Graphics cards would be useless. The only thing that is capable of solving intensive optimization problems is a CPU. This would mean, practically speaking, **everyone could run a node thus making the network that much more decentralized.** No more thousands of useless machines performing useless operations in chinese firetraps.
* Making economic sense
 * As I mentioned earlier, the biggest thing 'wrong' with bitcoin is the fact that it is deflationary. This was specifically set up to try to and rig the game in favor of early adopters (not you or me, but the first dozens of people who performed little to no valuable work and stand to reap the biggest benefits (looking at you, Satoshi)).
 * Why would anyone ever spend any amount of bitcoin if, because of the deflationary nature, it is guaranteed to be worth more tomorrow? And the day after that, more? And the day after that... point is that a deflationary or flat currency encourages people to horde meaningless, utility-less 1s and 0s rather than to invest in actual companies that earn actual money (aka, why everyone has a 401k or Traditional/Roth IRA).
 * Without the incentive to invest, the economy faceplants. I know many on this subreddit preach 'inflation is the devil' but in reality, no it isn't. The US Dollar, for example, has a highly-predictable rate of inflation at ~2% per annum. Despite that, it is clearly the world's reserve currency of choice. Why? Because using USD enables companies to invest in the US economic sector, which generate better returns than lost by the 2% inflation. Point in case, over the last 50 years, the stock market annually returns approximately 6% on investment. Thus, even though some value is lost by inflation (obviously), you end up with a) a functioning economy that actually produces things and b) a functioning vehicle for investment.
 * And lastly, because of the deflationary nature of bitcoin, it is subject to insane amounts of volatility and is thus an **absolutely god-awful store of value**. If you put your money (USD) into a 401k and came back to revisit it one year later and found out you had lost 90% of your value not because of any bad investments, but because the USD was a bad monetary vehicle, you'd probably conclude "wow, the USD sucks for storing value. I'm never going to use this". Same thing applies with bitcoin, especially.
 * "No chargebacks" is a necessary part of bitcoin, but please for the love of god stop trying to sell this as a positive. It's clearly a negative. If Grandma happens to have her life savings shipped off to some wallet she doesn't recognize, not due to any technical failure on her part, she gets financially ruined with no possibility of recovering her money. **If bitcoin wants to catch on, it needs to be useful to consumers, not to merchants.** Merchants don't dictate what forms of payment are accepted, the consumer does. Since 'no chargebacks' is obviously awful for consumers, they will never adopt en masse and it will forever be relegated to 'comical first-try attempt at internet money'.
Honestly, if satoshi had bothered to make cloud computing, cloud storage, and inflation a part of bitcoin, I would buy into it. But since it's not, it's sort-of a silly and flawed first try.

I understand bitcoin. I am a professional software engineer. I write encryption algorithms for fun. Bitcoin is a massively flawed proof of concept that will never, ever go anywhere. Comparing it to TCP/IP is a joke, by the way.


Yeah, right. This is a pipe dream. If not, show me this 'disruptive' killer app.


Mildly agree that the blockchain is technically interesting, though again, it has zero practical uses as in every possible situation, a centralized solution is far easier, faster, more efficient, and effective than a decentralized one. That's the crux of the issue with cryptocurrency: it's a solution looking for a problem.

It's pretty melancholy over here, but we're having a party in if you want to join.
@_date: 2015-01-19 22:17:48


That'd be great if one existed. Too bad bitcoin isn't remotely anonymous.
@_date: 2015-01-05 09:22:51
... was this trying to be some sort of clever retort? Because you didn't address the fact that Somalia is essentially a stateless and taxless society that has failed miserably under the loving protection of the freest of markets.

tl;dr "It's important to be able to be able to spend your funbux on child pornography without some jackbooted thugs trying to stop you."
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:14:05
Are you writing it in javascript?
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:02:34


    &gt; implying you actually bitcoin is difficult to understand
    &gt; implying you're some technical savant for 'getting it'
    &gt; implying you don't know anything about CS theory
    &gt; implying you're just a regular run-of-the-mill blubbering bagholder
@_date: 2015-01-10 11:09:42
So just to be clear: you support the laundering of money in support of child pornography, fraud, theft, scams, etc?
Cool, just wanted to make sure you were delusional.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:48:01
Pretty damned similar, imo. Both tend to worship prophets/profits
@_date: 2015-01-08 08:38:23
So you also advocate credit card fraud in addition to packing explosives in the mail and storing explosives in your apartment? Wow, you really are a clueless nitwit, aren't you?
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:01:42
Isn't this forgetting about the basic fact that half of all bitcoin volume is just faked, anyway?
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:31:47
You should definitely continue buying more shares of the ponzi, little guy.
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:37:56
The market for child pornography &amp; committing credit card fraud just isn't as big as most people here would hope, I guess

Lol, libertarians are cute when they get flustered.
AM I BEING DETAINED?

Why don't you program it in javascript
@_date: 2015-02-09 08:34:27


1) It's FDIC "insured"
2) That's for USD, not fucking bitcoins
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:57:58
Lol, cultists believing that their monopoly funbux are "too difficult" for a non-cultist to understand, haha.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:19:43
Wow a whole article by one guy, compelling evidence you got there champ. And he didn't say the internet was going to be a fad, you fucking moron.


You don't have to lie, bro. It's not going to help your neckbeard pesos gain value either.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:58:54






Also worth mentioning, **no one ever fucking thought the internet was going to be a fad.**
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:08:34
Sorry, I didn't realize that pointing out someone pretending to be an expert was so hurtful to a cultist like yourself. I should have predicted you would've lashed out.
It's pretty amusing how emotionally attached your are to this aspie, though, haha.
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:53:58
You do realize only cultists think that aspie fuck is amicable, right?
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:18:25
I am a professional software engineer and I've been an administrator on certain large hacking websites. Yeah. It's not that difficult to understand, at any level.

* Deflationary -- means you are encouraged to "hodl" rather than invest money into ETFs, mutual funds, businesses, etc. It represents a libertarian wet dream of no inflation, but that leads a broken-as-shit economy.
* Pre-mined
* Possibly the most elastic commodity of all time (e.g. there is no reason why anyone would or should use bitcoin over any other substitute "cryptocurrency", let alone regular CC processing). Even if big banks / wall st wanted to cash in on cryptocurrency, why wouldn't they just design their own coin?
* Irreversibility -- this is often parroted as a "feature" but it's very obviously an unfixable defect. Yes, it's necessary to the core of how bitcoin functions, but that doesn't make it a "feature". Imagine having to tell Dad "hey sorry about your life savings, but an Eastern European hacker stole every dollar you ever earned. Enjoy non-retirement."
I could go on but, eh, it's gonna fall on deaf ears in here anyway.

@_date: 2015-02-03 02:43:42
Keep on believing what you gotta believe, little guy. I recommend you throw every single penny you own into bitcoin right now. I love nothing better than watching libertarians/ancaps go broke and crying.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:34:22
The judge very clearly does understand bitcoin, and almost certainly understands it significantly better than you. Did you have a point you were trying to make here, kiddo?
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:06:29


I'm not a big fan of supporting the child pornography market, so no.
