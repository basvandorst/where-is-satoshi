I asked for assistance , not a life lesson. 
You'll get a nosebleed from being up so far on that moral highground.

Thanks for the sentiment, but it's not really what I was asking for, is it? 
If you don't have something nice to say.......

yeah, you have to keep closing and re-opening. If it's not there, I'll send you one more btc.  If you get them both, please send one back. I've sent it now, so the 12 hours starts again from now. If you keep refreshing it'll speed things up.

Sorry, I've edited the OP, it was from LBC which has the same details for deposits and sending....

I've now sent him a total of 3.5 btc. I'm not sure what he's doing with the wallet but I'll be darned if this $2000 plus is going to waste! I'm going to try one more send of 3 btc this time, I really hope it all doesn't come at once. If it does, will you send some of it back please?

ok. I'll copy and paste it and try again. 
I've sent two lots of 1 btc. It should show within 12 hours from now. Remember the refreshing, should hurry you along....

I really hope I haven't wasted 6.5 btc sending them to this guy. 
I have the best part of $4000 floating around the blockchain because of this. 
I think you're a scammer OP, a number of people have tried sending you BTC that you claim not to have rec'd!

You're asking about "earning". What are you going to do to earn the money? 
To start you off, I'll send you 1 btc (currently around $625 ) but after that you're on your own. 
Check the wallet every fifteen mins or so, can take up to 12 hours for the transaction to show. 
Keep us updated on how you get on ?
