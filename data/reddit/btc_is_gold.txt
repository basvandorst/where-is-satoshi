First of all thank you for your generocity. It's really amazing what you do.  
   
I propose [Projekt Šance]( from the Czech republic.  
The webpage says: *This project is the first preventative and humanitarian programme for commercially sexually exploited children and adolescents, victims of human trafficking, living in oblivion in the Czech Republic…*  
   
This project is for young people in desperate situations. They are offered a temporary emergency shelter and are given job opportunities so that they can be reintegrated into the society.  
     
The name of the project can be translated as "Project Opportunity" or "Project Hope". It really gives hope for many people.

*Diversification is a hedge against information you don't know.*  So if you're all in then you'd better know hell of a lot.
  
If I'd go all in, I wouldn't store BTC in cold storage, I would store it on many **big** exchanges.  
  
**Why would I store BTC on echanges?** What if there's a bug in code (for example if BU takes over hashrate)? How fast can you sell your BTC if there's a bug in code? Do you remember how fast the price dropped on 5th January? If you'd have BTC in cold storage then you can sell it in 1 hour (6 confirmations). What if the price goes -30% per hour? Don't forget that panic sell would trigger transaction spam (as on 5th January) and your transaction from cold storage to exchange can take very long time unless you set up proper transaction fees. But maybe it is possible to sell BTC from cold storage fast - they say on Gemini exchange you can trade with 0-confirmation but I haven't tried that. You got to be ready for sudden price drop when you're all in so you can save at least some of your money: you can set automatic sells on exchanges (stop losses),...
  
**Why would I store BTC on more than one exchange?** What if your exchange gets hacked? Remember bitfinex from last year!

Regular people don't get it. And that's why they don't trust it.  
  
They think it's a scam. Regular people don't know how decentralized network works, they don't know public key cryptography. That's why they don't trust it. If they knew the mathematics behind it then they would trust it. The price of every money in the history of the mankind was and is based on trust.
  
Regular people don't realize that finite supply of money is better than infinite. "Economists" say that deflation is bad and inflation is good because banks and governments want to print money. Money is symbol of capitalism. In history governments ruled the religion to make people to do something. Today the governments have money to make people to do something.  
  
Simply put: people are not educated. Schools won't teach them because schools are controlled by governments. News in TV won't teach them. Governments talk about fake news but it's the governments who create the most of the fake news.

I think if a country bans bitcoin then it won't be such a problem. World is way bigger than one country - there are many big countries with: China, USA, Japan, UK, Germany, France, India, Brazil, Canada, Korea, Russia, Australia, Indonesia, ...  
  


It looks like China won't ban bitcoin. China had some much time to ban it and hasn't so far. See latest news: [Former Governor PBoC on CCTV today: Bitcoin will continue to exist. We should properly regulate it rather than try to kill it | Twitter](   
  


As stated in that tweet above. I think that governments will only regulate cryptocurrencies, not ban it. They will use AML/KYC, will track the movement of cryptocurrencies and will want cryptocurrencies to be properly taxed.  
  
Even if a *developed* country banned cryptocurrencies: it takes several months before the law is in effect. Only in totalitarian countries laws may be in effect immediately.

Of course it will. And it shouldn't take that long. Look at the charts, trend is still upwords since mid-2015 even with slight bubbles. Have you seen how BTC recovered since the dip from Jan 5th?  
  
I personally bought few days back at $1040, I didn't expect such big dump but I don't care. I used to panic in the past, but not anymore.  
  
BTC will recover again and with AML/KYC in China, BTC will be stronger because it will have more credibility.  
  
There will be only 21 mil. BTC ever. Many BTC's private keys have been lost so it's been estimated that there will be approx. only 17 mil. tradeable BTC. Imagine that you have 1 BTC then you're one among other max. ~17 mil. other people in the world that can have such balance. How many people are in the world? How many people would like to have BTC?
  
With BTC merchants, markets and technology coming every month up faster and faster I do not fear. The demand will be high. BTC will be WAY more valuable than today.  
  
BTC ETF will come as well eventually it's just a matter of time. World is big, some country will create ETF which should pump the price way more as well.  
   
Believe it or not, these dips are best times to buy more because now the price is low.  
I know a millionaire who hoards BTC to hedge fiat money. He says he won't sell BTC for years unless there's a technical bug in code. When there's a dip like this, he buys.  
People coming to BTC think that they will be rich in a month. Well, you must wait a little longer.
Traders like newcomers because newcomers often buy at top and panic sell when the price dips. Then traders buy at low and repeat the process. You must get used to it, this happens at every stock market. There's old wall street saying: *Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered*. Look it up. Don't be the pig.

Bitcoin's benefits:   
-  **Public and investors** know only bitcoin. They don't know LTC, ETH, ETC, ZEC, XMR, ...  
-  Merchants, exchanges, gambling sites, affiliates, ... they mainly use bitcoin. Impressive are the gambling sites - e.g.: [Bovada]( [NitrogenSports](  
- Bitcoin's blocks have been already almost mined so the **inflation** is low. Unlike ZEC (!). Even LTC has quite high inflation...  
- Highest **market cap** of all cryptocurrencies. That's why bitcoin's price isn't that volatile as altcoins'. That's why investing to bitcoin should be less riskier for regular Joes than investing to altcoins.

Using [OTC markets]( i.e. directly trading between two people. Even bitcoins are traded that way. Such trades don't influence the price because they are not on exchanges.  
  


  
You're right. Winklevosses fund will have 100k bitcoins. Winklevosses will issue 10 mil. shares of price 0.01 BTC / share with max. offering price $10 / share. So yes, people will be buying BTC through them. But max. 100k bitcoins.


  
I meant that trading BTC through ETF isn't same as trading BTC on an exchange. Buying 10k bitcoins through ETF doesn't influence the price like buying 10k bitcoins on exchange. 
  
ETF price tracks the price of bitcoin exchanges. Winklevosses would use their own index [winkdex.com]( that uses 3 top US bitcoin exchanges to calculate the price of ETF ([link](
The fund's bitcoins will be locked in cold storage so it won't circulate on exchages.

March 11 is the deadline for COIN ETF decision. SEC has to decide to either approve or deny the COIN ETF. SEC can approve/deny before March 11.
  
If COIN ETF is denied then the price can dump ~10 % within month. If approved the price should soar. Higher probability is that it's denied. Chance of approval is max. 33 %:  
Bitmex: 33 % [  
25 % : [Bitcoin ETFs for dummies | etf.com](  
   
There are also other two ETFs planned for SEC in 2017:   
- SolidX ETF - decision by SEC to be made on March 30, but can be delayed (unlike COIN ETF).   
- some other ETF - i don't know off head   
   
It highly likely that if COIN ETF is denied that then also SolidX in March 30 is denied. That'd mean the price may dump more.  
  
So if you want to buy low then I think you should wait for SEC decision. If you'd like to be among the first to know the SEC decision then you should read this tweet: [  
  
Trend should be up to ETF decision - see: [

I think the same: ETF disapproval means instant price dip and a better time to buy, ETF approval means the price will go up for weeks.  
 
But on the other hand I bought my first bitcoins at the top before Bitfinex hack. I hated what the price went down and was scared and sold them. It's a great experience though. I wish I had those BTCs from last July's top.. I think every true hodler has to experience a drop of a price so he's not a *week hand* but a *strong hand*.

I've found this comment: [You can also encrypt the seed letters in cryptosteel using your own cryptography. For example [Vigenère cipher]( followed by [Transposition_cipher]( Why would you do that? Imagine that an attacker gets the cryptosteel, by using the encryption it takes some time for the attacker to decipher the seed and meanwhile you can send BTC to a new wallet. This requires that you remember the seed. For remembering the seed you should use [Mnemonic Peg]( It's quite easy. Why would you do that? Well, you can't fully rely on the cryptosteel. What if someone steals it? You should always remember the seed in your head + create at least one backup of the seed in case you forget it.

- [Bitcoin Price Analysis - Japan take over volume lead | BraveNewCoin.com]( The article doesn't say why Japan takes over volume lead. It's because of zero fees. Of course they take over volume lead. It's same as in Chinese echanges before PBoC probe. It is mostly fake volume.

I've read these "news" when I was noob. Not anymore and I know many other people like me.  
These sites think that every event of the whole world has some relation with bitcoin. Look at the number of new articles on these pro-Bitcoin sites: if there will be a great article in the future on the pro-Bitcoin site then this article will be "inflated" by other articles. It's same as with money - print more means devaluation of the money. Here the fake news devaluate great news.  
  
I get it that you post these articles for money. No problem, everyone has to make money someway.

Sorry to hear that. I also learn the hard way.  
  
With bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) you have to wait until the transaction is confirmed.  
  
**What probably happened to you:**  
Scammer created first transaction to your address with some transaction fee. He then created another transaction to his address with **higher** transaction fee. Transaction with higher transaction fee gets processed by miners sooner. Scammer probably had only 0.1 BTC on his account so the first transaction can't be processed after second transaction.

Halving is every 4 years, so every 4 years the price should double. At least for another 2 halvings.  
  
Then there's the effect that bitcoin in few years will be almost mined, that should make the price up.   
Imagine that oil is almost mined, that would make the price of oil WAY up.   
  
I still think it may be the best bet of my life even if it can crash:  
- **Public** knows it as a payment method (unlike other cryptocurrencies)  
- It's the first cryptocurrency - It's like Facebook vs. other social networks  
- Limited supply, can't be inflated  
- Only 21 mil. BTC **worldwide**  
- It's still relatively new, so it has potential

Currently it's bad for bitcoin what they do.   
I've commented about it already on reddit: 


I live also in CZE as Parallel Polis and don't like EET either. But there are much better ways to fight. In the end it will end that Parallel Polis will get fines from the Ministry of Finance. Maximum fine is 18500 EUR but Parallel Polis can be fined many times. How long can Parallel Polis tolerate the fines?  
Link: [If Parallel Polis won't accept EET law then it may end up that bitcoin will be banned in CZE because of people like this. And what will people say when they hear the term "bitcoin"? They will say that you will pay high fines for using bitcoin, that you can be put into prison because of bitcoin. Regular people wouldn't want to use bitcoin. That would slow the spread of bitcoin in CZE. (Bitcoin isn't that strong yet to openly fight with governments.)
   
**What should Parallel Polis do?**  
  
The should run their Bitcoin Cafe **with EET law**. That way the Bitcoin Cafe will be legal, government won't have any problems with it and **public will see that bitcoin is good, that it isn't banned**, that everyone can run their business with bitcoin.  
   
I wish good luck to Parallel Polis.

They would need approx. another 29.7 EH/s. That's increase of another 900%. 
  
For segwit it's needed 95 % of hashrate.  
Let's say that the +25% increase from last month would be signalling pro-segwit. For simplicity let's say that pro-segwit would currently have ~50%.  
  
Current hashrate is 3.3 EH/s =&gt; 1.65 EH/s is pro-Segwit and 1.65 EH/s is against-segwit.  
The 1.65 EH/s that is against-segwit must be 5 %.  
1.65 EH/s = 5 % =&gt; 33 EH/s = 100 %  
95 % of 33 EH/s = 31.35 EH/s  
So we need increase of (31.35 - 1.65) EH/s = 29.7 EH/s.
That's increase of 29.7 / 3.3 = 900 %.  
  
  
I hope it's correct :D

Sorry for your brother.  
  
First: You should check if he created a will. Private keys can be printed on the will. But beware that in such case the lawyer could send the bitcoins anywhere. So I guess it won't be on the will. He may have printed the keys somewhere as well. It can be stored on a paper in a book,...
  


  
Create a new account exchange for the proper heir and sell them on that exchange. See below.  
  


  
As of BTC in Poloniex,Bitfinex:  
If you had the login credentials you can withdraw the bitcoins and send them anywhere and sell them. But I guess you don't have the credentials - In such case you should communicate with Poloniex, Bitfinex. They will need a proof that your brother is no longer alive and they would like to know who are the heirs.  
Beware: You should know how many bitcoins your brother had before communicating with Poloniex, Bitfinex. Why? Before they could tell you that your brother had only e.g. 5 BTC instead of 50 BTC and steal the remaining 45 BTC. Better safe than sorry...  
  


  
You will need to have the private keys. If you had problem getting the keys post a comment below.  
When you have the private keys create a new exchange account for the proper heir.  
Exchanges: gemini.com / kraken.com / bitfinex.com.  
Choose an exchange depending on your country.  
When you have an exchange account you a bitcoin address will be created for you on your exchange account.  
Then send bitcoins from MultiBit to your exchange-bitcoin-address.  
Then sell BTC for USD/EUR/... on the exchange.
  


  
Check his email properly.  
  
EDIT: As of MultiBit wallet - check if he created a backup of the [seed]( (probability is high). With seed you can restore the wallet and then you don't need the private keys anymore.

@_date: 2017-02-11 21:27:43


  
By spreading the message on Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, schools, ...  
By being an example that bitcoin works and that it has benefits. It's not easy to persuade other people because people don't like changes but there's no other way. People need to see that bitcoin is good for them and that they want to use bitcoin.  
  
Best example is [Andreas Antonopoulos]( He wants to spread the message. He travels around the globe to give speeches about bitcoin, wrote two books about bitcoin. Has huge amount of videos on Youtube ([channel]( Has great knowledge of bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, computers. Has IT diploma. He is from Greece so he knows what it's like to see that government steals money from people.  
  
Great analogy bitcoin vs. automobile by Andreas: *Car wasn't accepted when it was invented because people thought horses were better. That it would never work because there weren't enough gas stations to support cars and not enough people would have cars to warrant new gas stations being built. There weren't roads for cars, they had to prove themselves on dirt paths designed for horses which lead to them getting stuck. But as popularity grew roads were designed for cars. Not only were the roads great for cars but they were backwards compatible for horses.*  
  
Isn't that analogy same as email vs. letters?  
  
History repeats itself. Bitcoin is still new, it's like the internet in the first years. When the internet was a new thing, only a few people imagined that people all over the world will comunicate with each other...  
  
I recommend this video of Andres: [The Death of Money | London Real]( and I think the book [The Internet of Money]( should be good read.  
  
I don't recommend people like [Roger Ver]( and [Charlie Shrem]( They may look like good guys of bitcoin but not anymore.

I don't think that LTC is a *wiser choice*.  
LTC's price since Jan 2015 is +212 %, BTC's price since Jan 2015 is +372 %. So BTC is performing better than LTC even after BTC halving.
But don't forget that LTC has not been as mined as BTC. Only 59 % LTC's blocks have been mined vs. 76 % BTC's blocks. So there will be higher inflation in LTC than in BTC and the price of LTC will go up more slowly than BTC's price.
**Security:**  
For such big investment it's needed that the investment is secure.
BTC has highest market cap so it should be the least risky cryptocurrency.
LTC has not that great developers as BTC so BTC should be more secure than LTC.
  
Altcoins may be good for small investments, but not for *that* big investments.

Every difficulty adjustment is made after 2016 blocks. Difficulty is adjusted so it takes approx. 10 minutes to generate a block. So it takes approx. 2 weeks to next difficulty adjustment (calculation: 2016/6/24 = 14 days).  (Source: [Difficulty | Bitcoin Wiki](  
  
Let's say that hashrate drops by 50 % immediately after difficulty adjustment =&gt; it would take 20 min. to generate a block instead of 10 min. =&gt; it would take 4 weeks to next difficulty adjustment instead of 2 weeks.

@_date: 2017-03-13 12:23:32
Roger Ver, ViaBTC, Jihan Wu, ... they all want Bitcoin Unlimited.  
  
**Why is BU bad?**  
  
Currently in order to change the blocksize a change in code has to be made followed be &gt;95 % consensus of miners.  
  
BU is coded differently: There's no need to make a change in code if miners want to change the blocksize. Miners can change the blocksize as they wish (but there has to be majority of course). 
  
The problem is that this ever-changing blocksize can be a security problem. Noone has tested it properly.   
  
**Why does BU want to increase the blocksize?**  
  
They want it because transactions take long time and because not so many transactions can be processed. Same problem hase Core. Core's solution for this problem is SegWit.  
  
SegWit increases blocksize from 1MB to approx. 2MB and enables second layers like Lightning-Network for processing many transactions / second.  
  
Core wants ultra-secure layer with small blocksize + second layers like Lightning-Network.   
BU wants all-in-one solution which doesn't neccesarily have to work. What if blocksize goes to 20 MB and still it won't process that many transactions? 
BU has crazy style of programming. I don't know if the test their code properly. For example in January there was a bug in their code [Source]( Core programmers review their code, use testnets (testing networks).  
  
Segwit has been tested for almost a year on testnet.

First of all: It isn't BU or SegWit, it's BU or Core.   
  
I think Core will win in the long run. Even if hard-fork (HF) would happen. If HF happens and BTC forks to BTC and BTU (Bitcoin unlimited coin) then SegWit activates and Lightning-Network (LN) activates on BTC chain. BTC will have first layer for security + second layers for fast and cheap transactions. 
  
Core has better programmers and more of them. Majority of the new code of bitcoin is done by Core programmers. 
I'm a programmer myself so I know what it's like to create a good program. 
BU people are mainly miners and some business people like Roger Ver + some paid people to spam media and create FUD. 
  
Plus: businesses like merchants, exchanges, gambling sites,... aren't ready for BU fork yet and implementing can take a lot time.
  


  
Why? I don't know ask them. Main BU's subreddit is , you can try it if you wish.    
  


   
I guess so. Why AntPool switched to BU when AntPool is the major HW miner manuafacturer (Bitmain Technologies Ltd)?  
AntPool may like the debate between Core and BU. AntPool may sell more HW miners that way: If BU has high hashrate and Core doesn't want to stay behind then Core has to buy more HW miners...
  


   
I don't know, I'm not one of them. But that may be the reason why they block SegWit. Currently the fees are high and I guess miners like it. If transfer fees would be way cheap (for example using LN) then miners could lose a lot.

It's already happening.  
  
Imagine that *someone* criticizes that blocksize should be higher. So what he does? He spams the network so the blocks are full. When the blocks are full, he can say that the fees are high,...  
  
For example Roger Ver from has 300000 BTC. He can spam all day long.  
Or miners could do it so their revenue is higher.

I guess it will be activated first for LTC because LTC needs only 75% consensus for activating segwit.
If segwit is activated for LTC and LTC-segwit succeeds then probability of activating for BTC will be much higher.
Still I think that 95% consensus is too high and that it won't be activated for BTC.
On the other hand LTC-segwit could be a great test of the segwit.

Bitcoin's value is same as every other currency in the history. The value is **trust**.  
  
**Value, i.e. Trust**  
- Very rich people tend to save money because they have so much money that they don't need to spend it. So they save money to houses, gold, paintings, ... . I'm interested in bitcoin because I know a millionaire who knows a lot about bitcoin, hoards it and don't won't to spend it in decades (only if some technical problem). And hoarders are the people who give value to bitcoin [why?](  
- You can trust that bitcoin won't be inflated, nobody can freeze your account, you can cross borders naked and still have money in your head. You can **exit** the current bank system anytime you wish.  
- Bitcoin is also paradoxly backed because you can **expect** that governments will fight against cash, money-laundering (i.e. even against bitcoin!) and that also gives value to cryptocurrencies because there won't be any alternatives.   
Examples: After Panama Papers millionaires will try to find safe heaven somewhere. Gambling sites like Bovada accept bitcoin.  
  
People of Greece would see the value of bitcoin if they knew about bitcoin.  
I highly recommend watching these videos:  
- [  
- [  
  
**Is it like stocks?**  
- Every currency in the world is like stock. You can speculate, bet agains, ...  
- Bitcoin looks to be like stocks much more than dollars because market cap of bitcoin is still very low. So the volatility is much higher than other currencies. So yes, traders treat bitcoin to *Buy low, sell high and repeat.*. Thankfully exchanges in China started quitting margin trading.  
  
**Mining**  
- Mining requires expensive miners so you need a lot of money to mine. You can use cloud mining service but beware of scams!!  
- Freshly mined coins are better than other because such coins don't have transaction history. You can sell such coins with premium (of course not using exchanges).  
- Profitable vs. unprofitable mining: Depends on the price of hardware, cost of electricity. Technological development (Moore's Law). There are calculators online to determine if mining would be profitable for you.  
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:34:36
See. Now the balance is **0 BTC** and those unconfirmed transactions were **deleted**.
**Why is that?**
There's a safe mechanism: Before adding a confirmation by adding the transaction to a new block, the miner checks if there's enough bitcoins in account. If there's not enough balance on account then the miner won't add the transaction to block and the transaction doesn't get a confirmation.
**Everyone can create the so called *"double-spend attempt"* like OP thinks:**
Let's say you have 0.001 BTC on your account A. 
Send 0.0009 BTC to address B.
Now create another transaction of 0.0009 BTC from A to address C.
Your balance should be something like -0.00082 with two unconfirmed transactions.
But after time only one transaction will get confirmations, the other transaction will be deleted and your balance won't be negative again.
**Conclusion:**  
1. You should NEVER trust an unconfirmed transaction.  
2. Answer this: How a transaction gets a confirmation?  
3. Answer this: Why is it possible to double-spend when having 51% hashing power?  
@_date: 2017-01-19 08:48:06

Within a few days my USDT lost 8 % of it's value because USDT has lost the 1:1 peg and was set loose. I didn't know if it would go even lower so I sold all USDT for BTC to hedge against USDT. So I lost 8 % of my holdings. If you don't believe, look at the [price chart of USDT in April](  
  
In future it may not end with 8 % losses for USDT holders but it may end up with &gt;50 % losses.

1 - I will simplify it a bit here: ASICBOOST is a method to mine Bitcoin better. SegWit won't enable ASICBOOST and that may be reason why Bitcoin's development stalled for over a year. ASICBOOST isn't bad, bad is when the development of Bitcoin is stalled so that one miner/manufacturer earns more money.  
  
2 - LN needs SegWit, that's why LN isn't deployed. Development of LN is in a good phase and is being tested on testnet4 (where SegWit is). See: [   
  
3 -  SegWit is a soft fork. Soft forks can be activated using UASF. UASF in simple terms: If almost everyone says that he wants a soft fork to be activated, then the soft fork will be activated.
  
4 - Number of nodes doesn't matter, hashrate is important. BU has ~35 % of hashrate (including possible ASICBOOST bonus). Plus some pools may fake signal for BU because they don't want to be attacked. BU would need &gt;75 % of hashrate to be able to successfully hard fork. So I wouldn't be that scared of BU.
  
5 - If almost everyone says that he wants SegWit to be activated, on August 1st nodes won't accept non-SegWit blocks.   
  
6 - First of all: it's UASF not USAF. UASF is a mechanism to activate a soft fork. See: [ELI5: UASF]( UASF would be used to activate SegWit.
  
7 - First of all: Core = Bitcoin. Rogue developer Gavin Anderson created a label "Core" so he could come up with Classic/XT/BU versions to destabilize what he labeled "Core". We want Core because Bitcoin = Core. UASF is only a way to enabling SegWit without the need to have over 95 % hashrate. So if you want SegWit then you want UASF.  
  
8 - Antpool is a mining pool created and owned by Jihan Wu. Jihan Wu is also a owner of Bitmain. Bitmain is major manufacturer of HW ASIC miners.

Segwit2MB doesn't solve the current problem BU has.

This solution may be even worse than Segwit+BU_HF. Why? Because BU code is shit so BU would create shitcoin that noone would like to use. Core people would get SW+LN and BU shitcoin wouldn't be a rival.

They'll be able to change the blocksize dynamically. Currently the blocksize is static in code.  
   
Current Bitcoin code is like this: **Everytime** when you want to change the blocksize limit **a change in code** has to be done plus this change has to be **activated** via miners.  
BU works differently: **Only once** has to be made a change in the code and activated. Next times **miners only** activate the blocksize change. This leads to miner centralization. Eventually miner with majority of hashrate can change blocksize at his will.  
  
In BU miners have more power.

A pump happens mostly after some news. Your chart miss the news.  
    
I think there are at least 2 more information you should provide:  
  
 * **Why the price pumps?** If USA announces that it makes all cryptocurrencies legal then price *will* pump and *may not dump*. On the other hand, a pump created due to fake news will highly likely be followed by a dump. For your challenge it can be generalized, simplified so nobody can recognize to which cryptocurrency the graph belongs.  
  
* **What is the market cap of the cryptocurrency?** Low cap cryptocurrencies/stocks are easier to manipulate. For example a "pump" for currencies like USD and EUR can mean increase of 5 % vs. "pump" in Litecoin can mean increase of 50 %.

I guess you mean ~~centralization~~ decentralization.  
  
* Everyone can be his own bank, there's no central point. Money in classic banks are only IOUs and it's not guaranteed that you'll get your money. They can shutdown/freeze your account. Classic banks are centralized in the central bank / government. 
* Bitcoin network is decentralized like BitTorrent. There's no central point of failure. You have to shutdown Internet to shutdown Bitcoin.  
* New bitcoins can't be created out of thin air like in central banks.  
  


  
Current Bitcoin code is like this: **Everytime** when you want to change the blocksize limit **a change in code** has to be done plus this change miners have to **activated**.

In general, **'ready'** means that the company is **prepared for the proposal to move ahead.** This typically means that the **company already has code running on their system that can handle the expected impact of the proposal in question.**
It is possible to be ready for a proposal but not explicitly support it.
In general, most companies who wish for a proposal to move ahead AND are ready for it will mark themselves under 'support' for that proposal although this is still up to the company to make the distinction if they so choose to.

Speculative? Finite supply is good, not speculative. Looks like you like fiat with central bankers who can make money out of thin air. I live in a country where inflation during several years devalued currency by 50 %.
  


  
Bitcoin's value lies in these:  
  
*  **decentralization** - no bank, no government can't steal your money, freeze your account, ...  (ETH is centralized)  
*  **merchants, utility** - unlike ETH there are many BTC merchants, services,... Where can you spend ETH? Only at exchanges. ETH is like a pink sheet that only traders gamble.  
* **limited supply**  
  
Ethereum is a scam, owned by Vitalik. Read these:  
[The Complete Story of Ethereum so far](   
[Ethereum: Chain of liars &amp; thieves](  
(I'm not Whalepanda but you can reach him on Twitter)  
   


  
BTC has only $20 bln. market cap - of course it's volatile. Plus until 2016 the inflation was really high. Important is whether the trend is upwards or downwards. Look at Venezuela - their currency is also volatile but the trend is downwards. BTC's trend is upwards.  
  


  
Value isn't in low volatility. How volatile is a stock with 0 $ market cap? - It has 0 % volatility, therefore it should be great, right? /s   
Volatility doesn't matter.

This doesn't solve current problem which is BU:  
  
Imagine that you're a BU-person. How does this solution help you? BU people get only 2MB but they want to control blocksize. This solution doesn't enable it.   
    
Plus increasing blocksize to 2MB is risky. See: [   
  
This solution may be even worse than Segwit+BU_HF. Why? Because BU code is shit so BU would create shitcoin that noone would like to use. Core people would get SW+LN and BU shitcoin wouldn't be a rival.

Good point. I admit that after reading this post, I too accept that UASF is rushed.  
  
But UASF is a good tool for "Plan B" when miners don't want to cooperate. And miners should know that UASF exists.

Check this  Not a proof but either Roger has a lot of BTC or his pool/friends have a lot. 
@_date: 2017-04-23 15:02:16
I may be wrong here. If so, please correct me.  
   
Current safety mechanisms:  
  
* Nodes have to be upgraded with a new code in order to accept bigger blocks. If miners create a larger block, nodes simply reject such a block.      
* You can *be your own bank* if you run your full node.  
* Developers are our technical advisors, they peer-review the upgrades of the protocol, propose changes and inform us about threats.   
  
Imagine that BU is running:  
  
* All nodes are BU nodes which are ready for dynamic changes of blocksize.  
  
What if miners go crazy and set max blocksize to 1GB? [Roger would say that it's only the max size and not the actual size]( OK. But what if miners start spamming the network with transactions? That would force node operators to shutdown because of the bandwith and storage requirements. Less nodes means less secure network. Users wouldn't be able to run a full node anymore, they wouldn't be able to *be their own bank* anymore, they would have to rely on others.  
   
Let's try to spam the network:  
   
1GB of transactions would cost 10 BTC/block if we assume 0.00001 BTC/kB tx fee. (Fees would be low because blocks wouldn't be full)    
These 10 BTC would get the miner who would mined the block.  
Miners could create a shared pool of money for financing the spam-bot. Every miner would donate proportionally to his hashrate percentage to the pool.  
  
Even if this attack took only a day (144 blocks), it could be a disaster.  
  
This attack wouldn't be expensive if prepared. Attackers can short BTC before the attack.   
  
The problem with BU is that when the max blocksize is set too high then anyone can create such an attack. Noone would know how long the attack would last. But even the miners can use it. If you've seen how [Wang Chun (F2pool CEO)]( influenced LTC market 2 weeks ago using his tweets, you would not want BU. Miners could use BU to create FUD and profit from it. Bitcoin is a currency. A currency should be stable and not volatile. BU would create a lot of volatility. The possibility of such an attack is great for traders. Traders like volatility. But users don't like volatility.

It's not upon developers. Developers are like technical advisors - they suggest.

I don't think Luke Jr. shares your optimism. Luke's quotes from last week:  
  


**Anything larger than 300k per block is unsustainable**. To start a new full node, one must validate the entire blockchain history back to 2009. Each individual new block expands this. Considering past improvements to bandwidth, CPUs, and development optimisations (which evidence suggests can't continue at their current rate forever), any growth faster than 300k per block results in an ever-increasing cost to perform the initial sync.

PoS is "great" for people who have already accumulated enough. For example DASH scam has something like 60% PoW vs. 40% PoS since the inception. DASH creators mined well enough in the first hours that they don't have to do the mining anymore.  
  
PoS may be good when the rewards are way low but it has to be well prepared.

**TL;DR**  
  
* UASF proposals terrify both Jihan Wu and Jiang Zhuoer because they realize that **UASF will visibly demonstrate the "miners decide" narrative to be as false as flat earth theory**.  
* Even MASF are eventually user-enforced.   
* Miners' block signalling is not voting, can be faked and often is.   
* All soft forks are eventually user-enforced such that miners cannot revert them. **If we are doing MASF followed by user-enforcement anyway, we can skip the MASF part.**   
* Miners hate UASF, they know they can only fight it with rhetoric and scare tactics.   
* [BIP8]( allows MASF but without any veto.

True. Even if BU had 100 % hashrate, there wouldn't be a tested BU code to fork to.   
  
It's a political debate, i.e. who will have the power. [Roger is paying for anti-SegWit propaganda]( Jihan says that SegWit is ["good technology"]( and that ["miners love LN"]( but he supports BU. Why? Because BU would give miners more power.  
  


  
I don't think so. Jeff Garzik now tries updated [BIP100]( [BIP100 updated - By Jeff Garzik and Tom Harding | bitcointalk.org](    
BIP100 is better than BU but it's still a dynamic blocksize and that could lead to a disaster.

Increasing blocksize to 2MB is risky. See: [  
  
Plus this solution doesn't solve the current problem which is BU.  
  
Imagine that you're a BU-person. How does this solution help you? BU people get only 2MB but they want to control blocksize. This solution doesn't enable it.  
  
This solution may be even worse than Segwit+BU_HF. Why? Because BU code is shit so BU would create shitcoin that noone would like to use. Core people would get SW+LN and BU shitcoin wouldn't be a rival.

Bitcoin is based on [Austrian School]( of economy instead of [Keynesian economics]( which is used in current fiat currencies. There's a great book [How an Economy Grows and Why It Crashes]( showing Austrian school. I can't recommend it highly enough. It's written in such a simple way that even your grandma gets the idea.  
  


  
I live in a country where inflation devalued the currency almost by 50 % within several years. And it's not that bad, in Greece, Venezuela and other countries it's way worse. People in UK, USA may not see the problems with inflation.    
  
Currency should hold value. Yet expansion of money supply decreases the value.  
  


  
Why?  
  
Deflation is bad for borrowers. That's maybe why central banks and governments hate deflation. If you owe something and next year you owe more, then you don't like deflation. Debts of countries is so huge that deflation would be bad for the countries. Inflation on the other hand makes the debt to be smaller.  
  
Bitcoin isn't only about deflation. Bitcoin's property is that you can *be your own bank*. You don't have to trust others. Currently you have money in banks in order to pay online. The banks lend your money for 10-20 % interest because of [Fractional-Reserve Banking](

Be careful when dealing with Chinese people - they have different mentality than USA/EU people. It's different if you break a promise with a Chinese people than if you break it with a USA/EU people. 
  
I'm glad SegWit is getting activated. But we should be extra careful - they still want their HF in 3 months.

There may be limits for the size of transaction in the first version.  
  
First version of LN on BTC was planned to be limited to max. 0.042 BTC / transaction.

Code is open source. So it only depends on the developers of the specific coin if they're able to add it.   
  


  
I don't think think that either. I only think that new coins should improve the crypto world. Look at this fun article to know how easy it's to create a scamcoin: [Torcoin: Crypto's latest scam](

True. Though these pumpers in suits are needed. Traditional investors and average Joes don't trust cyberpunks, geeks, cryptoanarchists,.. **yet**. We're still too extreme for them. Average Joes need to hear from TV that Bitcoin is good.

You think SegWit would be implemented in Litecoin without proper testing? Do you imagine what would happen if it was broken? SegWit has been already tested and doesn't need Litecoin for another testing.

Limit in the first version will be for transactions, not channels. Quote:    
  


Later, the limit will be raised as the integrity of the network is more proven.

It is a scamcoin because it hasn't added any value to the cryptocurrency world. If those folks focused on improving Bitcoin instead of making money, it would be way better.

You will have to sign the transaction. I've read something like that Trezor HW wallet will work with LN transactions. So if you use Trezor for signing, you should be fine.

**You want:**

- no hard fork  
- no chain split  
  
**Miners want:**  
- SegWit  
- hard fork  
  
**UASF wants:**
