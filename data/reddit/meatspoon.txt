That last sentence is incorrect.  If you read about the history of paper money in the US you will find that individual states had central banks that acted irresponsibly and inflated their currency for the reasons described in the book excerpt.  In 1913 the Fed was created which took over the power of money printing from the state CB's.  Since then, the Fed has devalued the dollar by 98% and the devaluation is accelerating, not slowing down.  It is inevitable, when you can print money and stick the public with the tab, bankers/governments print money.

sigh.  this sort of response is what will keep people from becoming active on reddit.  I signed up years ago, have a few game of thrones comments a while back and then nothing.  I try to comment on ethtrader and can't (due to no karma), I try to appeal to fellow crypto enthusiasts/speculators/traders so I can simply have a voice to add to a conversation, and you wanna urinate in my Cheerios.  Thanks man.  Very inclusive.

Thats what i was trying to do in Ethtrader.  And your assumption that you are the arbiter of what is quality and what is not is rather snooty. Why not let people comment freely and allow the community to decide what is quality and what isn’t?  Its this sort of culture that will ultimately kill Reddit—censorship, cumbersome posting rules that make it difficult for new people to get involved and dickish attitudes from those incumbents who think they are better than others without a shred of evidence to justify that stance.

I think the bigger question here is how you choose to live your life.  Even if BTC goes to 100k tomorrow and you cash out for $192,000, if you continue to make poor decisions like drive drunk and rack up credit card debt, your future lambo will be repossessed anyhow.  This is what a lot of people don't get about wealth accumulation.  If you don't live a responsible lifestyle, it doesn't matter how much money you make.  It will all slip through your fingers.  
You have two kids and you are drunkenly crashing cars, racking up CC debt (read: willingly becoming a debt slave) and you have an immigration case (is this the byproduct of a bad decision somewhere along the line?).  Those two kids depend on you to make reasonable, rational decisions.  You need to model the behavior that you want to see them engage in as adults.  
Sell the BTC and pay off CC debt.  Resolve your two court cases.  Stop making poor decisions.  Then, with disposable income, dollar cost average back into BTC.  Good luck.

I get the point.  You are making the same "point" that everyone who interviews Peterson is making... your point is you are trying to twist words to put a false paintjob on what he is saying.  He routinely makes people just like you look foolish for such attempts, and your attempts are no more sophisticated than the media hacks who embarrass themselves on a weekly basis with straw man arguments against his positions.  Words mean things--very specific things--and he chooses his words carefully.  You are trying to tell me and everyone else what he "really means" with his words.  Pffft.

If you limited Fiat you would also destroy our banking system (not that that is necessarily bad).  Banks use fractional reserve banking in which they can loan out money that doesn't exist.  Its basically criminality that has been sanctioned by the state.  If banks couldn't loan out money that didn't exist, many would likely fail or have to drastically restructure.

Literally none of what you said about him is true.  Amazing how people like you can just make false claims with a straight face.  And then you recommend doing research. Rich. 
Saying something like “Peterson says gays can’t be parents” is so inaccurate it is embarrassing.

So now you are admitting he didn't say what you said he said.  But you are now saying that he meant what you claim he meant by saying something different than what you said he said.  Brilliant.
