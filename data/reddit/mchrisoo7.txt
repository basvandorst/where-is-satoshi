Ah ok, thought it's the "end goal. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:56:28
Why would you back something up, if it is nothing worth? If I mined BTC in 2009, I had never thought about a value of 1.000$ each coin. You shouldn’t look at such things with consideration of the history of bitcoin’s value...
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:33:09
You can still buy BTC without any problems in china. Not with an exchange but with P2P transactions. That’s even harder for tue government to prevent money laundering (very clever, right?). 
The planned mining regulation is not a problem at all. Some miners did already left the country. It won’t effect BTC in any way...so what’s the point? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 09:59:08


Any ressources for that claim? China did ban ICO's but not Bitcoin. That would be completely new for me...
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:16:19
Why would you be in it, if you're only interested for the technological features? You can be interested for it but you don't need to invest for it to keep an eye on the technological aspect. 
So, everyone who is buying cryptos do it not (only) for the technology. They do it a) for financial reasons or b) to save his money and take it out of the current financial system. 
For me: I want to make some money...but I'm also very interested in the technology aspect (oppertunities, coding and so on...)

Bitcoin “Core” is the original Bitcoin because it has the community support. Thats how open source works. The project takes that kind of development that the big majority of the community wants. Thats how simple it works. The white paper is ONLY the start of the project “Bitcoin”. Of course it includes longterm ideas, but thats not how open source works. Open source projects can take a way different path as initially thought.
If you look at Bitcoin Cash, it has obly a minority support out of the Bitcoin community. Even if you say BCH is the “original” Bitcoin or the “original” path, the big majority of the BTC community doesn’t think about it in the same way. 
In fact it dependa only on the community support...not on the white paper or what ever...
PS: I never downvote posts.

The fees are currently very high. If you would buy btc for 20$, you would pay a lot of that amount just for fees. If you want to buy btc, you should do it with 500+. Otherwise you would pay too much for fees in my opinion...

@_date: 2017-12-24 16:08:30
So...20k will not be hit in the next few years?  Keep that in mind, if the price hits 30k+. 
Also: Bitcoin is a network...if you got more user into bitcoin...the price goes up. Only because it looks like a bubble, it doesn’t must be a bubble. Just look at the chart for: IPhobe-Sells, Facebook-User and more...
But yeah...maybe your right and BTC is a bubble. But guess what? It’s a bubble since 100$...you’re not the first and also not the last one who will say that.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:32:48
For sure it was...that was the idea behind Bitcoin at the beginning. It’s just stupid to say “Hey, such high fees doesn’t matter...btc is a store of value...sooo, high fees are okay”
No. High fees are not okay and that’s why people working on LN...

Roger Ver is always bashing against Bitcoin. And he obviously wants bitcoin to crash. No matter if you like BCH or not...Roger Ver is not a good face for it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:32:29
No, he didn’t. He wants still be a part of it. Otherwise he wouldn’t bash btc the whole time. Also he claims that BCH is the “real” BTC. So, he obviously didn’t quit the btc community. No, he thinks BCH IS the btc community. But that’s just wrong...Open Source doesn’t work like that.
He can focus on BCH and let the btc community do whatever they want to do. That’s how you would leave the btc community. If he acted this way, he also wouldn’t get so much hate like he gets currently...

30% is also not the norm at bitcoin, but still normal for BTC. It’s also normal that BtC will make big dips...just like in the past years. A “bubble” is a different thing...
For sure there will be a correction...like everytime...
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:25:56
Don’t get the logic. Miners must also spend money...so they soend also coins at the end...
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:05:01
Alot transactions on chain? The blocksize is still 1 MB...there can’t be so mich transactions than today. Or do we will have the same problem as today with lots of unconfirmed transactions? I guess no...so, the number of transactions would be less than today...that’s not “ALOT”.


Makes not so much sense...
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:54:29
If you fork BTC and only few miners are mining the “new” BTC, you won’t get a working chane. So...you can do so maby copies as you want but the copies wouldn’t work so good like the original one would (if they even work).
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:46:53
But the fees won’t increase on-chain. So, even if the miners get the fees and no block reward anymore, the profit would be less than today...
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:55:37
Just different scaling solutions...
BCH: on-chain scaling (bigger blocks)
BTC: off-chain scaling (SegWit, LN...)
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:25
loooool, but 1.000% in a year is no bubble territory? Come on...BTC is just not a normal thing ;)
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:45:53
This solution has the same outcome as blocksize increasement. So...there would be the same problems with it. Also: A blocksize increasement is also a very simple change in the protocol ;)

I can a little unserstand his opinion too. But still, I don’t like his acting. If you don’t agree with the developement of butcoin, you can leave the bitcoin community. But if the big majority are fine with the development of bitcoin, there is just no reason to bash it the whole time. The longterm development of an open source project can be way different from the originial (longterm) idea. 
If you make a new “product” you should focus on it. But instead of it, Roger bashs against bitcoin the whole time. For me...he lost all his creditbility because of this kind of behaviour. Such behaviour is just childish.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:45:01
Congrats, you’re right. But you don’t really want to conpare an average with the past days? Not the first time that BTC is rising like that...
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:39:24
That was not my question.  If the block-reward decrease over time (less coins due halving), the block reward in sum will be less than today. So, why should a miner put so much hashpower into it as today, if the reqard is smaller?
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:54:09


Do you have any references for that? Oil for example is traded in US Dollar not in gold. Or what do you mean exactly? Also Bullion Banks don't use gold as a currency. 


Which point exactly? Because I got no point which contradicts your last argument. (?)

You have no data for answering that question. You can only speculate about it...
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:06:33


The fee is so much lower on BCH...you don't even pay few cents for it. And for sure an increased block size can be used for more confirmations in the same time period. Don't know what do you mean with that "propaganda"-stuff.


SegWit will improve Bitcoin and the fee will go down. But you don't solve everything with SegWit...you need also other solutions.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:36:14
Are you serious? How do you think someone is obtaining Bitcoins? Or how someone ist selling it? You just need sellers and buyers for it...

Why would SegWit2x not community consensus? I don't get your point. Again: Your opinion might be not the same as of the community...


Do you really want to compare BCH-community with the potential community round about segwit2x? BCH was a stupid rushed fork.

GDP is measuring the "economic value" (simple expressed) of a country. Market cap measures the economic value of a company or raw materials. Completely different things. Thats just the point I mentioned. And obviously Bitcoin is not a company...so, yeah.

"The whole reason for the fork was to deal with slow transactions times."
Not really...the main reason for a hard fork was the scenario that segwit will not be adopted by the miner. The reason doesn't exist anymore. The current hard fork has no good reason at all...

What they paid doesn't matter. The current price matters. It's the same thing with shares. If you bought a share of Apple in 2000, the price you paid in 2000 doesn't matter for the current market cap. There is just no "real" market cap. 


The market cap tells you the CURRENT value of something. There is no "if you would sell all the coins/shares" or what ever.

It decreased few days ago. It was more proftiable to mine BCH. So, a lot of hashpower was going to BCH...few days later (today) the difficulty increased and hashpower will go back to BTC because it's more profitable than BCH.

In my opinion it could be a little problem but not a big one. Currently the most people buy cryptos mostly for the potential profit. But When the demand is saturated, the price will stabilize and you will not have so much volatility like currently. There will be a deflation of maybe 1 to 3%?
It's kind of the same thing like with the fiat money. There is mostly a 1-3% inflation. Nevertheless there are people out there who just save money...same thing just in the opposing  direction. Therefore you can ask the same question: Why would people save money if the money loses his value every year?

In my opinion contracts with 2 years or more are way too long. Fe month could be very useful but I don't know any cloud miner where you get such contracts. With such a long contract it's kind of luck to get some profits at the end. Nobody knows what difficulty exists in 1 year or even in 2 years+.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:19:50
The main goal is to establish Bitcoin and other coins as a currency I guess. Thats why a lot of people hype the development in Japan. For sure there are a lot of people out there who are comparing Bitcoin with gold but only because of the similarities. It would be surprising for me, if the majority only want Bitcoin as a digital gold. Because if they do, they already reached there goal.
Venezuela and other countries:
In countries like Venezuela you got political and economic problems. For sure there are people who take any possibility to safe there money and Bitcoin is currently a good one for it. But think it otherwise: If Bitcoin would be already a currency in Venezuela, you're money would be already safe, right? 
To be clear: There is no possibility that Bitcoin will ever replace fiat money completely. But for the national economy cryptos would be a really good alternative for the people. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:47:15
Gold is not a currency and nobody uses gold like a currency. Thats a really big difference. People invest in gold to "save" there money from a potential loss of there fiat money and not to buy stuff with it. Thats the reason why the price goes up, if there are critical times. 2008-2012: Big loss of trust into the financial sector. 
Cryptos should be considered as a currency which combines the benefits of gold but also the benefits of currently currencies. If a big majority is using cryptos as a currency, you do not have the same situation as with gold I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:10:52


As a whole? Then you end up like in the past years where you can't make any improvements because every time there are few people in the community who are complaining upcoming ideas.


It's not based on community consensus? So, you want to tell me that most of the community didn't want SegWit2x and will reject it? Well, if thats true, it will just a little hard fork without any users, right? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:23:59
Not really. The examples you mentioned need a good technical understanding of it. In my opinion a hard fork ist easier to understand than the details behind the blockchain technology which is used by bitcoin.
The current articles from the mass media also didn't come up with such things...
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:15:24
Also you didn't pay anything for the BCH. So, you're not really loosing money ;)
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:18:17
"This currency has endless possibilites so where are the risk?" 
Could be going down? You can't know what will happen in the future. Maybe there comes a surprising scenario...nobody can tell you.
Also you can earn a lot of money if you invest in stocks. Don't use them for speculating...but it's a topic for itself. But in the end you must know what you are doing. Don't just spend your money into something where you think it can't go wrong because some feelings.

I'm not a fan of BCH. So I don't care about the future of that coin. Also I'm not telling that the only existing solution is to increase the block size. But it's a good addition to other solutions...
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:22:06


You want an actual community consensus? You will never find a solution where you got a 100% yes for it. Even SegWit got no 100%. And you want to tell me that most of the users will not accept SegWit2x? You will see it, if it comes to SegWit2x. Maybe your opinion is not the same as the majority of the community 
And don't come up with stuff like that:


I mean, are you even a full user? Your post doesn't sound like it. If SegWit2x will get no user-support, it will go down like hell. So where is your point? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:54:04
 is also a good way to buy BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:54:14
You don't must buy BTC on exchanges. You can also do buy or sell offers. 


This is not true.
The market cap only describes the current value of (mostly) shares. If all shares could be sold or would be sold in the future, it doesn't matter for the current market cap. Also if you would sell every share, the price would be fall down like hell and the market cap falls with it. So...the "if you would sell"-part, is not important because the market cap is just the current value and doesn't include scenarios like big sell or buy offers...


Would be difficult, if you have most of the shares. You need buyers to sell something. If you got more shares than buyers, you won't get it sold...unless you would sell it for some peanuts.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:51:57
Not at all...just a hard fork but not a big deal. Keep calm and relax :)
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:22:38

First of all you need your private keys. With the keys you can get you're BCH coins in wallets wich supports BCH. Currently I would wait a little bit with it. But if you can't wait with it, you can use wallets like Electron Cash or coinomi.

There is no "right" time. Don't wait for a price drop or what ever you might be thinking about. Just buy some coins every month for a little amount of your capital and hold it. Simple way but a very good one ;)
You should also take a wallet where you got your private keys, dont hold your coins on an exchange.

Are you serious? Just think about it. If the number of transactions increase, you will need better hardware. You can't even mine without a big investment currently. Also the blockchain will be too big in the future for average people to run a full node. Either way, you will get to the situation where you need expensive hardware to be a part of bitcoin.


The best security brings nothing, if you must pay more for fees than for what you want to buy. Increasing the block size up to 2mb or even 8mb like BCH will not decrease the security.

Where I wrote that 90% of users support NYA? I clearly wrote that over 90% of the miners support it. Thats all you need for a sucesafull hard fork in the short term. Don't know why users should not support 2x, but SegWit instead...would be just curious.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:44:53
For sure! Thats how you get billionair today :D
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:55:41
Best way for it: Buy it with cash. Therefore you need a person to meet with. Otherwise I don't know where you can buy coins online anonymously...or maybe with a Bitcoin ATM, but Im not sure about it. That stuff don't exists on my place.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:17:11
On Bittrex you need 20 Blocks for confirmation I guess. Also I couldn't set the fee by myself. I will see how fast it goes but it would be nit so bad, if it takes a little while :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:58:35
Thats completly irelevant for my argument. Miners will always follow the profit, but still you need there aupport for such changes...
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:56:18
Currently there is a special situation with the EDA on BCH. The miners getting easy money with BCH...will see how long it will be switching...
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:13:35
You need support from miners or the new chain will not get on track. For sure, you can implement such thing like EDA, but then it could end up like it does on BCH currently. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:16:33
Do you have your private keys for that wallet? If you do not have your private keys, you can't get your BTC coins. Sadly, problems like that one occurs often. lol.
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:44:18
No, there will be only 21 million bitcoins. Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin and it's not the "original" Bitcoin. Also I don't believe that the guys who supports Bitcoin Cash see it otherwise. Would be very stupid if you say that BCH is the "original" BTC...lol
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:34:21
BCH is not BTC. Just two different thinks from now on, big difference thinks. Even the mass media will get that simple one. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:40:32
I think ViaBTC is mining but the difficulty is still really high to find new blocks in a short time. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:08:39
SegWit will be locked in during this period. Can't imagine that it will be blocked by ViaBTC. ViaBTC does not have the possibility to do that, so...
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:06:13
I think no one can get rid of the BCH coins. In the next days you will see how it all really develops. Currently it's there is no possibility to evaluate the fork...
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:00:24
Tou still need 20 on kraken? Thought it would be a short term thing until the mining stabled like it does now. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:53:22
Who is claiming that BCH is the "original" BTC? I see no one who is doing that. Also there is no one who is thinking that the BTC coins are now doubled...
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:28:38
BTC was a bubble on 100$, 500$, 1.000$, 2.500$, 5.000$ and now is it a bubble at over 9.000$. If BTC hits 15.000$ it's again a bubble...it`s kind of ironic. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:08:49
Oh, I’m sorry, thought you would write for universersity or so.
Well, it depends on the number of sites you need to write. If it’s not so much (5-10), you should focus on general things like “what is the blockchain-technology, proof of work...? What is the idea of Bitcoin (maybe summaries the white paper a little bit) What is the potential of Bitcoin? (different scenarios) And the developent of Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:16:37
currently the reward is 12,5 btc per block.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:57:34
“They” called bitcoin a bubble since it was worth some hundred bucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:52:06
Sorry...I don’t get that logic. People like cryptocurrencies because of the aspect of decentralization. So, it has nothing to do with “asking for permission”-mantra. A CEO has nothing to do with decentralization and to name himself a CEO for a cryptocurrency brings no sense at all into it...
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:07:27
It took years until myspace went down. Something like that does not happen in the short term. You should also remember that there were already people betting against Bitcoin...no happy end for that people ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:26:07
Look at the 7d-chart...jsut for fun: look at the 1month-chart...and now, don't panic anymore ;)
- You're welcome!
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:27:10
Dont invest money you need. What the hell is wrong with people like you? Cryptos are speculation...thats not a investment for life savings...lol...
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:31:34
Congrats to the gains
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:10:26
You can't compare it with normal markets...it's a completely different thing. A completely new technology without any mass adoption at the current time. If it comes to a mass adoption...the current price is still too low for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:19:44


Why should be BCH more profitable? With DAA the miners cant milk the coin anymore. If the hash rete goes up on BCH, the difficulty adjust as soon as possible. So, if the hashrate goes to BCH, the difficulty will adjust and the coin is instantly less profitable then BTC...if so much hashrate goes to it like in the past.


If you don’t think that Bitcoin can hold the current value and can’t rise anymore, then you can exit...simple, right? But there is no Fight like BTC vs BCH...
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:45:45


Wehere is the date come from? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:30:00
BCH has 8mb blocksize. BTC not and the x2 HF is now cancelled...so there are maybe few people who now going in BCH...
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:04:50
I just bought some VTC...but only with a few amount of my btc. Nobody can tell you the future.
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:43:47
just wait longer...lol
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:47:39
Jihan Wu controls 50-60% of the hashpower? Where you got that from? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:24:50
That drama...gosh. The canceling of 2x was just a day ago. A lot of people bought btc to get some free coins for sure. Just wait some days and the lrice goes up again. The price gone up like a rocket the last weeks...don’t understand why some people are so panicked about the little down. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:06:55
There is no useful cloud-miner...you won't make much profit out of it...so no.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:05:58
Every 4 year is a halving of fhe reward per block. At the beginning the reward was 50 btc per block, after the 1st halving 25 btc and now it’s 12,5 btc...the next halving is in 2020...then you get 6,25 btc per block.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:04:46


Lol...would never think about stuff like that. I'm using fun money only. There is no reason for me to use money or sell things I need. Also I want a buffer on my bank account...so, yeah. Just keep in mined: The yield is crazy high...seriously...crazy. I made a five-digit profit since I got into the cryptoshit and I must realize that shit first, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:29:42
congrats...and some big fishes are happy about your stupidity...gosh, dont get too greedy and you will be fine next time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:34:27


They're using an average, it's not wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:51:27
Just shared the article. I would never do margin trading ;)
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:20:54


Funny...look up amazon 1998-1999...the "bubble" popped up...but the price today is way higher than the peak of the "bubble". You are not the first guy who predict the end of the BTC-Bubble. Well, sell your BTC (if you have some) and leave the game. 


The idea behind BTC is a usage as a currency...there is not even a mass adoption today for BTC. The current value is way too low, if it comes to a mass adoption. 


Well, I'm in the game since a year...I put 3.000$ into the crypto world. Now, I got over 15.000$ and every week it goes up. Sure, it's crazy but I can't lose anymore...
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:09:50
Not anymore...hashrate is back on BTC...just warch your source again ;)
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:02:10
Just buy frequently. Every week some btc or every month...it depends on the money you can use...
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:26:08
CEO if Bitcoin Cash? Did I miss something? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:59:38
Did you ever write a paper for a journal? The question is way too general.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:22:53
If you believe cryptos will be a currency someday, you won’t sell anything. At the end you’re paying your bills with it...
If you want to make some fiatmoney, you set your goal by yourself.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:57:46
Again: IF you believe cryptos will be currencies in the future, you wouldn’t sell anything. IF it comes to such a scenario, the current volatile market wouldn’t matter because the value would increase like hell (because of high demand).
And no, that’s not really what I do. I see big potential in cryptos but I will sell something in the near future...so, yeah. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:04:13
My girlfriend knows about my cryptos. But I got into it a while ago...so I'm still very much in the profit. I would get maybe some losses, if BTC drops under 2.000$. 
Just be patient, in few months the price will be back on track. At least I assume...maybe I'm wrong and we will lose all our money haha
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:11:29


Lol...everyone wants to buy at that point...but nobody know the future...so...yeah.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:17:23
You misunderstood. If you think crytpos will be currencies, you wouldn’t sell anything for fiat because you could pay anything with cryptos in the future. I didn’t talked about status quo.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:31:18
It's not all about the technical benefits. There are few coins out there which are better than BTC, but you need adoption for success. Blu Ray...VHS...QWERTY...not the best techniques but they got good adoption. 
Also...nobody can predict the future. And btw: ETH doesn't really compete with BTC. Two different perspectives on it. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 11:11:35
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:07:34
Bought coins for 900; 1800; 2300 and 2700...price must fall a lot to get a little "panic-feeling". And even if it comes to such scenario, I can live with the lost...Got no money into it that I need. Thats maybe a good advise that you should keep in mind. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:37:49
You need to mine BTC to confirm transactions because you need blocks for it. And blocks must be mined...except you won't confirm the transactions in the blockchain directly...
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:24:05
What’s so hard to understand? The idea behind cryptos is a new way of currencies. If cryptos become official currencies, you could pay any bills with it. I mean...that’s the main point behind cryptos. So, if you’re belieiving in this idea, you won’t sell anything because you could use your cryptos instead of fiat money. Or what’s your exact question on this point?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:11:29


Lol...everyone wants to buy at that point...but nobody know the future...so...yeah.
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:22:12
Do the mass know about it? Everyone I spoke about it do not know a little bit about Bitcoin. Maybe they heared the name some day...but in most cases you must explain a lot fundamental stuff...
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:00:52
At the beginning I got the same behavior. Today I’m checking the price not even every day. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:54:22
It's still a niche in comparison to the stock market where you got a lot more of investments and actors. Also a economic crisis should not effect cryptos very much...
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:36:25
Lol...bought the dip at 1800$ few weeks ago ��
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:35:33
Bitcoin is no fiat money. Bitcoin and other cryptos do have an use value. But ok...
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:23:43
panic about what?
