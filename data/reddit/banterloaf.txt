What do you mean? There's been tons of decent mobile wallets easily available for many years. I always carry some small fraction of my bitcoins in a mobile wallet, just like I always carry a small fraction of my fiat money as cash in my leather wallet. I think this is how humans have done for thousands and thousands of years. That principle isn't going away.

Depends on the circumstances. You can add consumer protection through escrow for some types of transactions, if needed. Also, many more types of transactions, "consumer protection" (by means of ability for refund) is entirely unnecessary. For example if you are dealing with a trustworthy merchant that you know or have a permanent business relationship with. Or if you have already taken possession of (and verified) the product at the time of payment - for example: if you are paying your bar or restaurant bill :)
Many different types of situations, and crypto payments can be done in many different ways (pre-delivery, post-delivery, smart contracts, escrow etc depending on situation). Credit Card on the other hand, not so many different ways, which is why you have  chargeback scams.

It won't be implemented widely, unless businesses see some indications that people are willing to use whatever versions are already deployed. Why would they? Implementing bitcoin support, LN or not, is costly. Why would business take on those costs if even the  people who are already self-identifying as bitcoiners don't even want to use it? 
As a hodler myself, I find this interpretation of hodling ("don't sell or even *use* bitcoin! Ever!") to be retarded. Hodling to me means to not sell your bitcoin for fiat, and to deal with fiat as little as humanly possible. Don't sell your coins for fiat, but for the love of god, use bitcoin whenever you can, and restock your bitcoin cash from fiat whenever you can.

Because they are run as businesses, dependent primarily on customers. Big banks, on the other hand, don't have to care about customers because their sympiotic relationship with government allows them to profit off that relationship. Government is their main customer, the one they need to keep a good relationship to, not consumers.

That's the sad thing: These same people who have this near-zero understanding of crypto also have very strong opinions on (usually against) crypto. "I don't have shit clue about this subject, but I am strongly against any of it!"

This is ridiculous reasoning. Have you tried applying the same to US dollar? People go on a shopping spree with their pockets full of cash and USD credit thinking "hey my money is crap, I want to get rid of it, that's why I am buying new stuff!"
Typically "buying" involves exchanging one valuable thing (money) for another thing of value to you. Whether money is bitcoin or dollar doesn't change the concept.

But newcomers rarely fire up a node after getting into crypto, FOMO style, do they? Most newcomers just buy some coin on an exchange, leave it there. Only in a much more mature phase do they start getting deeper into the tech (if they do so at all) and start running nodes. At that point they've typically already turned into hodlers.

Bitcoin price is predicated on the assumption that one day full bitcoin adoption will be much more widespread than today. 
Merchants immediately exchanging the bitcoin for fiat is a necessary *first* phase in the transition to worldwide bitcoin adoption. 
The *last* phase is a closed loop bitcoin based economy, where merchants pay their employees and suppliers directly with bitcoin, because employees and suppliers *also* want to pay their bills using bitcoin.
But you won't ever get to that last phase if you don't allow the bitcoin economy to go through the first phase where the important thing is that merchants need to start accepting crypto at all, even if they aren't currently able to hodl the bitcoin they get (because they have invoices to pay, in fiat - which is why they too need to have suppliers willing to accept bitcoin payments, even if they, the suppliers also still need to convert to fiat). 
All you'd end up with is bitcoin becoming a medium of dumb speculation, that will eventually run out and go in reverse the day people start realizing that widespread adoption doesn't seem to be ever happening, because bitcoin never even got to the first phase.

I didn't say they should take a risk with crypto. I objected to people who don't know anything being strongly *against* (others using) crypto. As in telling others to avoid it, and often demanding that the thing is banned or discouraged. 
The sane approach is to be agnostic about things you don't know anything about. It is not sane to embark on a crusade against something you hardly know anything about. 
Avoid it for yourself, by all means, please do until you've figured it out enough to take an informed opinion.

Oh really, do you now. That's odd, because Bitwala services shut down 3 months ago because their fiat bank severed their ties.
Also, a little bit hypocritical to fall out against a company who converts bitcoin to fiat, and then recommend a bunch of services that DO THE EXACT SAME THING, namely convert bitcoin to fiat (to pay bills).
Get off your high horses - bitcoin will get nowhere as a payment if the companies that actually accept bitcoin are pissed on by fundamentalists like you, just because they are currently forced to convert to fiat to pay bills. Why do they need to do that? Because not enough companies accept bitcoin payments. Why do they not accept bitcoin payments? Because fundamentalist bitcoiners like you piss on them when they do, just because their bitcoin acceptance is not 100% kosher according to your high standards. Instead of supporting these companies, as they take one step at a time into a bitcoin economy.
Ironically, since you seem to have no problem converting bitcoin to fiat in order to pay bills yourself, through bitcoin-to-fiat bridge services such as the ones you just listed.
