right pulled from someones ass. So what do you want nothing or +/- 5% or 99% to 100% funds back.
Cause  if liquedation goed through you will get very little.

Can you trust the layers. Because they are not given 97% of coins back.
@_date: 2014-04-21 12:44:31
No it's not. because you could easily withdraw your btc's. If users could withdraw btc's then there could be know problem.
What is going on is.. The coins in Mt.gox (right IN mt.gox) are Temporarily not available for clients, for time being) are not gone/stolen.  
It's a wipeout trails scene. earlier or later the firm had to process the planned operation. 
It's depends on good will of Mark. From the start.
