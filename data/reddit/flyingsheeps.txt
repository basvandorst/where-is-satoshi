The meh game means I didn't bother with it.

WAIT! Solved it. That was silly. (it was the redeem karma message that was a response to... the other hasn't even gone through yet (sent it first), so I guess the question still stands.

Okay, so, correct me if I'm wrong: I've made a wallet. Now, when and if I get bitcointip'd on reddit, it will go to some random address (will it always be the same one?), and then I'll forward that to my wallet via reddit message to the bot. My wallet will be my bitcoin hub. (How do/Can I get it on my phone?)

I actually had my mom interested in it during the sudden jump to $250 earlier in the year. We never got around to buying some and now we're kicking ourselves.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't the internet CERN?

I see. Thanks.

IIRC, I did. 
Here's the bitcointip address:

Yep! When I go to the bitcointip address on blockchain (the one beginning with 12), I see 0.04BTC. I must've mucked up in sending it. I'll leave it overnight, if it hasn't worked by tomorrow I'll try again.

Sent a message to saying
    +bitcointip 19wSTsZVaPTi3GPbWbtgLopKzDjtCpx2GY ALL
That's how I send from my bitcointip address, right?

What's my new wallet? The one on my phone? On my computer!?

Okay. Is it safer to then forward my Blockchain money to my phone 'Bitcoin Wallet' app? Because  seems to allude to web wallets not being so secure.
