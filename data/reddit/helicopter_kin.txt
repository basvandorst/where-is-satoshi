Oh no, our currency may gain value! (I get that they're looking at this from a policy perspective but still)

Renewables still have decently high fixed costs. You're right that they're coming down though.

This is bad for commerce users which is often cited as what Bitcoin needs more of to mature.

I think the only people who are really f'ed are folks who held or traded on exchanges.  If you transferred out to your own wallet or alts it's much less likely that the IRS would try to trace your funds unless they're massive.

Sure, but did OP adequately obfuscate them for that purpose?  Did he buy through an exchange (discoverable)?  Did he obfuscate the transfer to a new wallet adequately?  Will the judge believe him if he says he no longer has access to his coins (divorce court is not criminal court, they can force you to pay if they think you're lying).

Bitcoin services in regulated countries can and likely will be regulated.  Yes, unrelated alternatives will crop up, but most users won't want to use unregulated exchanges that can't accept ACH and could trivial perform an exit scam.  It's unfortunate but probably inevitable

If he got married after he purchased them then he's probably good, not shared property.  Until he sells and muddles the cash with shared accounts.
Also, nothing a divorce attorney likes more than finding a hidden account.  They'll really fuck you in response.

Millions of low committal, long tail users.  Literate, long-term, large-cap holders are perfectly capable of crashing the 2X market *if they sell*.  The question I have is will folks have the guts to sell or will they hedge their bets.

Governance issues seem (to my relatively uninformed self) to be the most concerning issue for all cryptocurrencies.  However, I cannot tell what a good governance structure would look like.  Too distributed leads to infighting, too consolidated leads to perverse incentives.

? $5 billion market cap increase does not imply $5 billon fiat injection.  Market cap is set by current supply and demand.
