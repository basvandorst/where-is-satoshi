I'd really love to hear some feedback about that - what do you guys think? Would you like to use one? :)

Corporations will start using cryptocurrencies when there will be demand for it so it seems that still - Bitcoin users adoption is too low. I think it's easier to start using Bitcoin when some of your friends actually uses it and invites you into it by tipping you. You are then convinced by someone who you trust (at least more than a stranger). Plus there is money you can get from that :)
Disclaimer: Me and my friends launched today a project called [CryptoTipIt]( We aim at sending Bitcoins by e-mail. We've a small tutorial section for new adopters and try to spread Bitcoins that way :)
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:18:15
You absolutely are! We need to set up the details ;)
I thought about taking micro payment (like satoshi) from tip. I don't know about other models.. do you have something in mind?
Thank you!

It's your second comment with feedback in my idea's topic, have one on me!

I'm not entirely sure why is that argument against hardware wallet, but I might not fully understand or misunderstand BIP32. Could you please elaborate? :)
@_date: 2014-05-15 22:47:02
That's fascinating, I play piano too, I might use them :)
"pick 6 chords that play along with each other" -- it doesn't limit randomness - think of it like this - every chord is like one side of 6 sided dice. Therefore the randomness is exactly the same if chosen randomly. To make it sound quite all right you can spare one bar for every chord in 80-chord sequence and you'll have maybe quite long, but safe musical wallet :)
You should add pdf generation with sheet music to bitcoinpaperwallet :)

Yes, transactions will be signed offline. I guess the idea is evolving a little bit :) 
Now that I think of, I could just keep the private extended master key on the paper. Or not doing it at all, and just generate it always from passphrase (but if phrase is weak, the wallet will not be secure).
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:04:08
Thank you! :)

Thanks, I actually use Armory right now (HD wallets FTW :) My idea was just the way of joining different types of storage to one wallet :)
@_date: 2014-05-16 11:33:32
Awesome idea :D

It seems very hard to create machine that will be absolutely safe and that is crucial since we keep a lot of money with it. If we don't, then simple hot wallet is sufficient since it's not worthy of hacking to it.
I personally don't fully trust machine described like that - I don't need to have great hardware knowledge and don't fully trust creator didn't put some additional malware in it. I thought of doing it on something stock like Arduino, but one of my friends told me to be careful with that because it's possible to make stock product look unchanged while actually adding some cool functionalities to it. (He told me that in arduino there is a little bit of space under chip to put something, I'm not sure about it and I'm not judging it, but it's concerning).
Anyway - my point is - if we have more money I still feel that using paper wallet + hot wallet is best option. I personally use diceware and always recommend it. 
I even started working on cool fancy way of doing diceware passphrases and having fun. I called it [DiceWallet]( and am still working on it.
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:44:53
Hah, thanks! :) I must reconsider that one then!
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:49:16
Wow, they have pretty neat thing going over there, thanks for link, I'll check that out :)
Edit: Damn I forgot - Thank you! :)
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:58:26
You have a point here. But tbh. till Bitcoin there are no alternatives except for keeping money in your sock. But that's not very convenient.
On the other hand banks are bound by some laws and you can try to enforce something on them if something is wrong. I'm not saying you are safe with bank, I'm just saying they are more regulated.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:47:39
I'm glad to hear that! What do you like the most about it? You can sign u for that [here]( :)
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:45:10
The one you can see here might not be entirely fair, but that's just a prototype - in the final version I want the dice to be stocked only with custom design - I know it doesn't fully guarantee fairness, but that's first step.
I couldn't print more dices for now, but my idea was to give you 5 dices that are somehow ordered (by numbers, or colors, or it will be pointed out to read the result from left to right always). I also thought about other shapes of dices, but for now I'm keeping the classic 6.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:56:06
Is there actually anything working for micropayments?
I still feel like it's tought to keep your Bitcoins really safe, so the easy-to-use secure wallet might be kind of killer (but that's not a killer app of course :)
@_date: 2014-04-25 17:56:15
You need to know a little bit about Bitcoin to use these services. Cryptotipit can be used to share BTCs with non-techie.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:39:21
Whenever I'm on a lunch with friends I'm asking them if they are ok to pay and I'll give them cash back in Bitcoins. They laughed at first, but now it's pretty common :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 22:10:59
The one thing I can think of is that the master extended private key is generated directly from passphrase so it doesn't have to keep the key. It can generate it in fly asking user for it.
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:28:09
Thanks, I will use sharp edges then!

Yes, people have to sign up the tip. After they claim the tip you will see information on your dashboard. It will be the information about who took the tip you sent. Emails are confirmed so it's valuable information.
Anonymous account just for claiming tip is worth considering. I'm not sure about it, but I will surely check how would that influence whole service.
Thank you for valuable feedback!
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:33:04
Good ideas. I feel that it's important that user can actually type his phrase in, because otherwise I can't guarantee any randomization and it might be trivial to break.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:36:24
It would be awesome to see [musical wallet]( on your site :) We should totally sit some day and try to implement it ;)
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:42:19
Disclaimer: Yes, we know we are doing similar thing to ChangeTip, but it's not exactly like that. We've had a pleasure of discussing our services on the phone and agreed we are not working on exactly the same field. ChangeTip adds services they support horizontally (reddit, twitter, facebook). While we are trying to focus on sharing by e-mail or/and paper tips which, as they say, don't want to occupy.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:49:53
Didn't know about that, I can't find any informations about that, do you have anything about that? Thank you! :)

I wanted H to be connected to the Internet since you want to do some bigger spendings from time to time, M+H should be able to sign the transaction that will go from H, so in that scenario M would be just for authentication purposes. They could interact by WiFi (that might not be secure, I'm not sure) or bluetooth or NFC for example.
I'm very open to other ideas of how that wallet should work.
For paper wallet. It's true it could work without two others, but two points:
a) better security, because if someone steals you Paper wallet, he needs all three
b) it could be more user friendly when connected with each other. Imagine you'd have software that would take care of all the transactions coming out from H. It could also have "import money from P" option, that would make it much simpler to move money directly from P to H and printing new P for you.

We want to spread Bitcoins with people who are no technical and not really into Bitcoins. That's why we added tutorials that aim to be super easy and adaptable for people of any level of experience.
So the service is not just sending Bitcoins by e-mail but literally spreading Bitcoins by e-mail :)
You also get option to generate link with Bitcoin tip fixed in it. Then you can give that link to whoever you want so he can claim it.
We're also considering adapting other platforms like tipping on reddit :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:49:51
Assuming the seed is given by user (let's say a long passphrase, I'm not yet sure how to make that more secure) - you'll get your private address generated by an algorithm that is public (like this:  With that in mind - you can type your phrase in bip32.org and check if the outcome is identical. Is that ok?
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:32:27
How would you see the boundary between anonymous account and registered account? Do you - after clicking link- have to at least set up a password, or you're just directed to your anonymous account that might be unsafe (because anybody with a link could access it).
Or should I just have an option to either register and send tips further or withdraw all from anonymous?
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:36:53
A good mobile BTC wallet must be trustworthy which means I have to own private key, you can't access it + I'd like to see the code to trust that app won't actually steal from me
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:30:40


That's why I want to add the backup. I agree that paper wallet doesn't need to be integrated in that system, but I wanted to add it there so you can have your BTC's kept in one place. With nice integration and user friendly design you could have a tool that is useful for daily spendings and secure for bigger amounts of money. The fact that you have 3 wallets for that is kept under the hood and that's why I liked that idea. How do you see that part?
Thanks for feedback, have 1 beer on me :) @_date: 2014-04-04 17:53:18
It's not about how good the service is. The problem user have to trust it. One of the best things about Bitcoin is decentralization. If someone else keeps private keys of my wallet, he basically keeps my wallet and cash for me. Like bank for instance. I can't let that happen. 
On the other hand if you don't keep my private keys, I still want to see the code, because without that I can't really tell what is going on under the hood. Look at how blockchain mobile app works - they indeed opensource the code. I'm not saying they are perfect though.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:55:20
I agree, that idea with multisig for mobile wallet is great. This sounds like an extremely good way to do it. Nice!
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:29:18
Thanks for the reply!


Yeah, I actually understood after your post that user has to seed it every time.
I wanted it printed because of the security - I guess paper wallets are the safest after all.
I wanted to use Raspberry Pi and label maker for printed addresses.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:30:38
Hm.. as I read about BIP32 it looks very good. I need to read a little bit more about it and surely consider it. Do you think it also helps with rainbow-table attack? I'm still trying to make that aspect of project stronger that just "well you need to choose good phrase" :)
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:04:25
Isn't salt just a password extension? It might make it harder to break but still - I'm not sure if that's enough
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:02:49
I assumed that if someone is spending time and money to take care of creating his wallet in safe offline environment - he will also think of choosing strong randomized passphrase for his wallet
Edit: The other idea going in my head is that your passphrase is only a seed to randomly generated passphrase and after you type it you'll get printed: private address, public address, passphrase. What do you think of that?
