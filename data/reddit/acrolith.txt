Hell, if it drops to $100 you just gotta zoom out until 2012. Look at those gains!!!

Yeah if there's one thing that gets panties moist it's explaining how blockchain works

Ah, you must be one of the "very strong hands" the OP is talking about

Assuming no one but you were interested in bitcoin, what do you think would happen to the price once you bought them all for $180,000?

If I make my own altcoin, and I value it at $1,000,000 but no one else has ever heard of it or wants it, is that illiquid? No. It is worthless. A person's valuation of their own property has no effect on its value. It's everyone else's valuation that matters.
Illiquid means something is difficult to turn into money, not because of different valuations, but because of practical issues. A nuclear facility is valuable but illiquid, because it's hard to sell and few people are qualified to buy.

Yeah, and if my phone smelled like feet or Mario got soggy and fell apart when it rained, I'd definitely be justified in bringing that up, too.
What I'm saying is, MtGox is a Magic the Gathering trading site, AND IT SHOWS. I'm sure they could connect me with people who'd give me a fair price for my Black Lotus, but the demands of a global currency seems to be a bit beyond them.

Hmm, it seems very odd to me that the Magic the Gathering Online Exchange site did not manage to adequately function as the primary transaction site for a global currency. Perhaps if they had years of Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokemon trading under their belts as well, I could be more confident?

That's cool, but you definitely seem to be in a minority. Most people (the ones who believe in Bitcoin, anyway) seem to be talking about how Bitcoin prices will keep going up, because of increased scarcity. If that's true, that completely defeats the purpose of Bitcoin. I don't want to spend something that's going to be worth twice as much, or five times as much, or ten times as much next year!

I think it is important for everyone to remember (especially the mass media) that Dutch tulip bulbs, the actual stem portion of the plant itself are still fine. They all still work, specifically you can still grow tulips from them.
What has happened is the perceived value of a tulip bulb has dropped, when compared to dutch guilders, francs, guineas, and most (all?) fiat currencies. **This does not affect the intrinsic values/functionality tulip bulbs have.** These are:
* The growth of beautiful flowers
* Sending them anywhere in the world (subject to adequate packaging)
* Seriously, have you looked at them? They're gorgeous
Again, a reminder: the problem, and the negative press that has begun, is **only** related to the perceived value of tulip bulbs against traditional fiat currencies. If you're about to write an article regarding tulip bulbs' recent drop in value, please make the point clear:
**The tulips themselves are still fine.**

To be frank, everything I've seen points to Bitcoin being completely unsuitable for use as currency. The volatility makes it totally impractical to use in lieu of actual money. And you can see this mirrored in people's attitudes. I don't think I've seen anyone talking about actually BUYING STUFF with Bitcoin in quite some time, which would be, you know, the primary function of a currency.
So if it's not suitable for use as a currency, what exactly is it for? What is the purpose of Bitcoin? To keep going up and down, and be a vehicle for wild speculation? It seems to be remarkably good at that.
As far as I can tell, for most people the entire purpose of Bitcoin appears to be "something I can buy low and then hopefully sell high." Awesome.

This currency has no long-term fundamentals. Or short-term fundamentals. It has scarcity, and requires effort to generate, but so does my shit when I haven't been eating enough fiber, and no one's buying that off me.
Here's a simple way of looking at it: if I were to create AcrolithCoin, a simple fork of Bitcoin using the same protocol and starting with the same scarcity/block difficulty as Bitcoin has now, would an AcrolithCoin be worth anything? No. And why not? All the "fundamentals" would be exactly the same. The only difference between Bitcoin and my hypothetical AcrolithCoin would be the extent of media coverage, and popularity: in other words, hype. Hype is what gives bitcoin its percieved value; nothing else.

That's a lot of words just to say "this time it's different."
The psychology of hype bubbles is always the same. And yes, it always involves the same resistance to comparing them to previous bubbles. Because this time, it's different! Bitcoins aren't like tulips! Dot-com startups aren't like traditional companies! It's a new paradigm! We're in uncharted territory!
I don't know how old I sound, but I'm old enough that I was reading Newsweek during the dot-com boom and bust. And I remember reading all of the same excuses and rationalizations I'm seeing now, because people don't change, and because there's always money to be made off hype.
