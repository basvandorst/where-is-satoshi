How strange, that's the current price now.

Well, I can't say these unfamiliar to me, as a commentor.

What? an ISK has a lower value than a Bangladeshi Taka?

I currently have  all my coins on xapo (i know that's supposed to bad, but their debit card is just too convenient)
But I also want to sell all the BCC I get on Aug Where should I put my coins if I want to do that?
