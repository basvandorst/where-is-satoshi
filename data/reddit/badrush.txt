I'm sure people will keep tracking it, so transferring large amounts won't really help too much.
What they probably have to do is sell amounts privately at a discount price to unscrupulous people or to those who are unaware of the origin of these funds. But that opens up the hacker, since if Joe Blow buys from Chad and then his friend who knows his public address informs Joe Blow that the BTC were stolen then Joe Blow might just say "I got these from Chad" and that may lead us to the hacker eventually.
Honestly I have no idea how you launder this much BTC because the few ways to do it secretly would take forever when you're looking at $60MM++. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:48:03
Yeah if they find someone is willing to sell them monero... So probably another exchange that doesn't care.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:23:22
Both. 
NiceHash is a preeminent bitcoin mining website that just got hacked to the tune of $60MM that didn't belong to them... so lots of users just lost a lot of money and an otherwise reputable website just got hacked which begs the question of how were they securing these funds.

You said you didn't want it in FIAT b/c of tax reasons. You could have sold your bitcoins locally for FIAT.
Anyways, you gave your BTC (~cash) to a website without doing your due diligence, you seem like a very bad businessman (hopefully you're not one).
I don't care if you spew bad bullshit about BTC though, only you and the ones that believe you without doing their own research will be left behind. Tell them I'd sell them BTC when it's $10k/coin so they can take their time deciding when to jump on board.

Why overcomplicate this. 
1. Buy the BTC and put it in your own wallet.
2. Create a little fake certificate that says **" 1 BTC Awarded to _____"**
3. When he turns 18. Open up a new wallet for him. Transfer the coin there. Give him the certificate.

So i know that hackers use dictionary words to try to crack it. Then they use words + numbers. Then they try replacing words with numbers. It seems like yours would be cracked in the fifth pass or so. As in they'd try just dictionary words, then they would try adding numbers, then try replacing letters, then replacing letters and adding numbers which would have yielded your password.
@_date: 2014-11-25 00:30:28
I thought the BTC transfer fee isn't zero. There are fees and the miners end up collecting it.

Hackers test for passwords by taking dictionary words and relacing the letters with numbers. So something like TANG3R1N3 would be solved super easily.

I have some concerns with that. If Bitcoin is just the framework, and the final solution will need to be developed then it'll likely introduce middle men, in the same way, that Paypal enabled online transactions when e-commerce was just starting out. The problem with middle-men is that they all want their fees and we'll potentially end up in the exact same scenario fiat is minus the government control. Lots of middle-men and banks required to facilitate the movement of money who all charge you fees along the way.

I'm going to get crucified for this but I think Bitcoin being deflationary is actually not what we want from a currency. It promotes too much HODLing and is holding bitcoin back.
Think about it, the wealthy almost always have to put their money to work somewhere in the economy because if they just leave it in the bank inflation will erode it at about 2% per year. So all of a sudden a ton of money that would otherwise be stuck in savings accounts is being invested in companies, businesses, and anything that will provide a return greater than inflation. Which is exactly what we need people to do with Bitcoin but most people would rather HODL (for good reason). 
Whereas with Bitcoin, even if you just wanted to buy an expensive car and could afford it, you'd be better off just waiting a year and in theory Bitcoin's value would go up due to deflation, meaning that car would cost you less Bitcoins tomorrow than today (assuming the fiat price doesn't change) causing this dilemma where you're rewarded for not using bitcoin.

So the IRS comes and says "You bought 10 btc in 2014... You never claimed to have sold them." Then you say "I never sold so I dont owe tax" then they say "prove it" we are auditing you. But let's say you actually did sell some because eventually you'll want to most likely. 
You then show them proof, pay tax + fines. OR you say I have no proof of when I sold it... It was a cash deal and I only made $1000 profit. 
Then they say without proof we will have to assume you sold at the peak price. So here is your bill for $50k capital gains + fees. ..
And none of this takes them much work and in the end they get their money. 
Even if you transfered into monero, if you can't prove what price you sold it at they'll just hit you with the max penalty.

I dont think you should include those clips of people protesting and silk road. It will just reinforce the negative stereotypes bitcoin has. Your words might say the opposite but what stuck with me was the imagery.

I am not trained in this field so this is all my opinion but when marketing is trying to sell an idea that people are reluctant to take on they do it in very gentle ways with ads that make people feel good.
Look at the scientology ads. They don't even mention scientology until you're already captivated by the commercial by all the nice and funny things shown/said. Otherwise people would stop listening as soon as they heard it was scientology.
So with bitcoin, I think the best approach would be the same. You have to make the regular people feel good and fuzzy before saying "Hey, you can do this with Bitcoin".

Even in the poorest countries there is a middle class. People that work hard and do everything right. Those people are still able to have maybe $10-$50k in savings. 
Keep in mind, if these people had grown up Americans, they'd be the kind of middle class family that has $100k plus by the time they are 40 years old due to them working hard and saving when possible.
Anyways, these people do almost everything right yet they cant control the economy so eventually they decide okay, let's take our life savings and get the hell out. The poorest of the poor in these countries are the ones that never even try to leave.
An interesting thing also is that a lot of voluntary  immigrants you see from China, Middle East, India, etc are not the poorest of the poor. A lot are families that could afford to relocate and decided they'd rather be poor Americans than middle class Indians or etc.
Obviously these are generalizations and not everyone has savings and not every one coming here is middle class. Some are poor and some are rich as well. But that's my experience. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:09:15
Think of it this way, fair market value means if you had 100 strangers sell their bitcoin to 100 other strangers how much do you think that average would be?
If three markets say bitcoin is on average $3565/bitcoin and localbitcoins.com most people are selling it for $3800/bitcoin you can't say it's only worth $2000 on the market that day. Anywhere between $3300 to $4000 would be more reasonable.
Just like with houses/stocks. You can sell it for $1 but they'll still tax you on the fair market value.

It gets harder and harder to double in value. So now it's harder and harder to get 100%+ ROI. 
I think most people here can't see BTC going past $10k/BTC in value and more than likely in 2020 it will be worth less than $2k so that's only a ~200%ROI in a very very good case scenario.

Bitcoin Cash supporters were Bitcoin supporters until the community couldn't agree on what changes to make to Bitcoin's software. So the main bitcoin group went down the path of SegWit/LN and the other group decided that making larger blocks would be the easiest way to scale Bitcoin at the time so they hard-forked and increased the block size to 8MB from 1MB
Then this community became split and if you thought that bigger blocks made sense you went over to BCH, if you definitely didn't want bigger blocks you stayed here, and if you weren't sure you probably kept both BTC/BCH you owned at the time of the fork and are waiting to see how it plays out.
Benefits of BCH is that more transactions can be processed and BCH is the closest to Satoshi's original white paper because it appears as though Satoshi supported increasing block sizes to deal with congestion. The downside is that there are less users, isn't as well known, and bigger blocks are seen as a pill not a cure.
Bitcoin has a bigger brand recognition and more traffic, but it's so congested since most people aren't using LN or the new features that developers are working on so you cannot easily get your transaction verified unless you pay higher fees ($2-$5) depending on the backlog of transactions waiting to go through. 
Only time will tell who is right. The sad part is the community is now so fragmented between this sub and the btc sub and everyone is just hurling shit at each other instead of thinking rationally.

The link above takes you through step by step on how to sign/decode a signed message.
Here is my ELI5:
If you control a bitcoin address. You can use special bitcoin wallet software to write a message and *sign* it so that people can know for sure that whoever wrote the message also **controls** that specific address. 
If people don't know who controls a wallet then it doesn't help as much. But for Satoshi, we know he mined the first few blocks so we know which bitcoin addresses are his. So if there was a message signed by his address, then we'd know the message was from Satoshi.
When you sign a message, someone can use bitcoin wallets that support message decoding to verify that it was your wallet signed it. Because when signing a message you use YOUR private key to generate a SIGNATURE (string). So only you could generate that string, and changing the message in any way would change the signature and people would tell that the signature no longer matches if they use the software.
**Possible Problems:**
* If you don't know who controls the bitcoin wallet address then the signature isn't as helpful. Since it could be an imposter. 
* If a wallet is hacked (your private keys are stolen) then someone could pretend to be you and sign messages and people will think it came from you. For example, if someone was able to steal Satoshi's private keys, then they could write signed messages and everyone would think that hacker was actually Satoshi until the real Satoshi disputed it.
* That's how we know Craig Wright probably is not Satoshi. He claims to be but is unable to create a signed message with any of Satoshi's original addresses. So either he's lying or he forgot/lost his private keys for those wallets. (But almost everyone thinks he's just lying).

What do you consider ludicrously large blocks? 8MB? 32MB? 2GB?
I can empathasize with what LN is trying to do but it feels like "let's freeze your body for 100 years until he we have the technology to cure your cancer" instead of just doing what is the easiest solution to implement now until a real "cure" is developed. 
Even if I was a LN advocate, I'd want a temporary solution in place which is as simple as increasing the block size from 1MB to 8MB.
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:11:36
And to clarify, I wouldn't be able to sweep them with mycelium phone app either?
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:47:23
I really didn't want to have to do this but I KNOW you are trying to pretend like your "knowledge" of the subject area means that your opinons == fact, so I went back because I has claimed that increasing block size is what Satoshi would want, and I referenced the Bitcoin white paper.
I'll concede that he doesn't talk about max block size in the whitepaper (I was mistaken). But I found this seemingly unbiased article (it's pro LN) that clarifies what happened... It turns out Satoshi talked about it in the forums and he himself said that the block size should be increased in the future as we neared the 1MB limit he imposed.
Here is what you replied to me, so clearly while you probably know the facts better than I do, you omit anything that doesn't support your narrative. 




You conveniently left out that the 1MB limit was much larger than needed at the time and Satoshi said that it should be increased as needed in the future. Unless you think whoever wrote the article is also a shill? Because then they are a SegWit/LN supporting shill. That's your MO isn't it? To waive off dissenters who question the status-quo. How ironic.

At least at that point you'll control your private keys. It's not as safe as cold storage but it's much better than coinbase or any online wallet.

Tldr: Bitcoin has zero flaws. Bitcoin Cash has zero strengths. You need a PHD in Computer Science to know how Bitcoin works, but don't worry if you don't, "just trust us ... we are decentralized".
[Meanwhile as of Jan 2019 38% of LN were controlled by one entitty and the top 10 controlled over 60%.](
I know what your answer to that is: As more LN are hosted, that will drop and it'll become more decentralized. Yet you cannot apply the same logic to BCH as adoption grows.


At the time of this reply, this website, says that the transaction cost is $3.92 on a Sunday afternoon. So if I want to buy anything and get that transaction confirmed in the next 10 minutes it will cost me that much. Your "10c" fee might mean the seller won't get the confirmation for hours. ***Let me see how much I need to pay right now to get my transaction in the next 6 blocks which will take an hour...* Ohh, I have to pay $3.32**
How many times have you paid for something recently where it was okay if the money arrived sometime in the next week or later that day? 
What happens during the week when more business transactions have to go through? [According to this site, the mempool size just increases during the week]( so good luck with your 10c transaction. 
At least I tried to be objective. I may not be an expert but at least my layman knowledge of the area is closer to the truth that you're condescending dismissals.

People call it Bcash because they don't want people to think it's related to Bitcoin. BCH supporters call it Bitcoin Cash because it was a fork of Bitcoin from 2018.
`Bitcoin == $BTC == real`
`Bitcoin Cash == $BCH == real`
`bcash == non-existent`

What would you do if you wanted to buy any good without a paper trail? Meet someone in person and exchange cash for the goods.
So probably localbitcoins
Alternatively use an exchange that doesn't ask for your information.

Use localbitcoins.com I found a guy that sold me some btc. It was a lot less painful than sending verifcation, wiring money, then buying btc. Just brought cash. Showed him the cash at a diner. He sent me the coins. After we waited ten minutes for a couple confirmations and then he took the money and we parted.

It literally is bitcoin. It has the exact same history until the split and is using the principles set out in Satoshi's whitepaper. If that doesn't qualify it as Bitcoin then BTC is definitely not bitcoin anymore either. 
To be fair people on this sub only say "Bcash" because they don't want BCH to be associated with Bitcoin but that's not possible since BCH has been associated with Bitcoin by birth. 
No one is going to deny that basically we have 2 competing Bitcoin forks (BTC/BCH) and both sides would love it if their fork won out so that they could reclaim the title of being "Bitcoin". 
BCH supporters even have a term for this occassion, the "flippening" when BCH takes over BTC and BCH becomes the predominent Bitcoin fork.

I like the idea.
On a side note, I would suggest you improve your photography. Looked at some of the items and the photos were bad.
It's really easy to improve them. 
1) Set up a small photobox out of cardboard. Since most of you jewellery is small, you can make a very small one. Take three pieces of cardboard with each being the size of a small cereal box. Glue them together to form 3 sides of a cube. Then drape a white or black table cloth along the sides of the box.
2) You can use the macro button on digital cameras to get more focused in shots of very small items that you have to hold the camera very close to to see.

When too many people want to sell at the same time, they'll undercut eachother. So the first person sells for $1 cheaper, than the next person says "what the hell, it's only a dolllar" and sells for $1 cheaper than the second guy. Before you know it, if enough people are doing it, the price drops significantly. The opposite is true for price rising.

They aren't jumping to crazy huge blocks anytime soon though. Even 8MB blocks ease much of today's congestion on the Bitcoin network. 
These incremental increases are going to allow the network to handle increasing Bitcoin usage while remaining respectful to the original vision for Bitcoin while a longer term solution is found/built.
Even if LN is the long-term answer, something should be done now to ease the congestion. I think it's very important that Bitcoin be stable (in terms of price fluctuations) and also be usable in most ways that US Cash is. 
But what was nice about Bitcoin was it didn't need me to run a node/trust anyone with my transactions. It seems like LN is a big deperature from that.

The people in heaven decide to build a bridge to hell to visit their relatives in hell. The people in hell like the idea and both sides agree to build half the bridge. So they start building their portions of the bridge and the people in hell finish theirs first while the people in heaven have barely started. So the people in hell ask why haven't built their half of the bridge yet and the people in heaven respond: "all the goddamn builders and contractors are in hell!"

This makes sense. A bunch of people who bought in a ton or mined a ton 1/2 years ago realized that they couldn't have asked for anything more than what they were getting and decided to sell all their bitcoins and retire early. Honestly I hope no one really thought BTC would shoot up vertically for much longer.

Yeah but people get scared when a few sell a lot of btc so everyone will sell to make sure they don't get screwed over by their neighbour who might sell. Then their neighbour sees everyone selling and it repeats itself until the market crashes. 
Don't be too naive to think ppl won't get scared and greedy and then sell off in panic. 
It's sad but when the going gets tough, be the first person to get out before the rock slide and get back on when everything is settled down. Don't try to brave the rockslide.
