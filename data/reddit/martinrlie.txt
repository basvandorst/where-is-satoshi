Ask [Charlie Shrem]( ;)
*In answer to one question, he even offered a fairly detailed explanation about how money went through the Silk Road website and his own Bitinstant company. He emphasized the point that he was not knowingly handling any money used in those illegal transactions. “There were like six or seven steps in between me and that process, and I was only part of that process. None of the physical dollars were ever handled by Bitinstant, they were [moved] into money transmitter-based accounts, either Moneygram or Western Union WU +0.66%. But none of those guys are in jail. I believe it’s because I’ve been such an outspoken evangelist for bitcoin.”*

Ah, I read it from the start as if he said they were on vacation (due to the "when they get back *home*" part), but you're right - strictly speaking that's also an assumption on my part. :)

I think he meant that they understand tech in general (but obviously haven't spent time understanding Bitcoin specifically).

If you do the demo, highlight the fact that bitcoin turns the payment system on its head as shown in this comic:
That is, the QR code you're scanning as a part of the demo is JUST a request for payment. The act of sending the money is completely controlled by you. With bitcoin, you're ACTUALLY transferring the money directly to the recipient's "account", whereas in the "old" system, you're turning over your credit card data (or similar) and then expecting the recipient to withdraw the money from your account (via a third party like e.g. VISA).

Depends entirely on your listeners' background (this is important to find out, if you can!), what message you want to send, how comfortable you are with the details, etc.
Here's some ideas you can have a look at:
 (some of the slides should work for you)
Like IkmoIkmo said, focus on a few use cases that they can relate to and explain how bitcoin can improve them. And, if you're confident enough, throw in a *short* live demo between two mobile wallets and explain that that transaction could have been a million dollars with the same negligible transaction fee. ;-)

What does that even mean? Difficulty is a concept that only applies at the block level, i.e. regardless of transaction "size".
@_date: 2014-03-13 00:36:17


But only if the transaction is considered a commercial activity (i.e. the seller is a company or entrepreneur that is selling in order to make a profit off such sales as part of his business plan). Single/casual trades or transactions between individuals aren't affected.

I think he's saying that if their wealth is currently stored in pesos, it doesn't matter whether they buy USD/BTC in the US or in Argentina. They'll have to pay 12 pesos per USD before converting to BTC regardless of where they're located, no?

Scary stuff. I hope this never happens. Although it would have some positive effects too, I believe the diminished privacy and increased surveillance effect would put this change quite far down the negative side of the scale for me. Unfortunately, I wouldn't put this past governments.
Here are some thoughts:
1. If this is implemented, there wouldn't just be black and white coins, there would be grey ones too (or off-white? :P). Grey coins were previously white ones that were sent to an unregistered address. Until they're registered again, the last registered ("white") owner would still be legally responsible for what happened to them.
  As many have pointed out, noone can prevent you from sending bitcoins to unregistered addresses, thus dirtying them. The coins wouldn't automatically gain value/demand from this, though, which is why I call them grey instead of black.
  Black coins are those that cannot be traced back to a white address - at least not easily. Only transaction outputs (coins) that doesn't have a registered address between themselves and their coinbase at all would be truly black. Only (entirely) black coins would be "anonymous" enough to be suitable for use on the illegal parts of the dark web - and thus perhaps more valuable.
  Grey coins would be less valuable than white coins, at least until they're obfuscated enough to become black(ish).
2. One possible "problem" with this theory is the centralization it would require. If all bitlicensees are required to verify recipients before sending coins to them, they'd need access to some kind of lookup service. This lookup service could (would?) be DoS'ed.
  Granted, there's several ways to distribute data these days (bitcoin, bittorrent and CDNs being some examples), so perhaps this could be overcome. Or perhaps it would push further improvements in anti-DoS collaboration between backbone routers. Who knows. It'd be an arms race for sure and today I believe the DoS'ers have the advantage as it's so much easier to perform e.g. a DDoS attack than it is defending against it.
3. If at first they would spend a lot of effort punishing grey/black transactions, maintaining a registry of white participants, etc. - why wouldn't they just ban bitcoin outright and mandate a semi-centralized blockchain (or blockchainish) technology like Ripple instead?
  I guess the answer to this could be that they don't want to work against the organic growth / network effect of the bitcoin network - as opposed to just regulating it?
4. Wouldn't the centralized database connecting identities to addresses be leaked by the next Snowden? Would they want to risk that in the first place?
5. Come to think of it, isn't Onename building the first step of this? :P
6. Not all transactions are directly tied to an address, e.g. P2SH transactions, which are important for escrow services and lots of other fancy stuff. How would such transactions be treated in this system? Would they have to be banned outright? Or would they just require any kind of output script to be registered in the same manner as the "normal" transactions?
7. Given all the buts and ifs, how large chance do you think there is of us seeing this kind of 1984-ish regulation?
8. Let's use the same analogy to describe the current (fiat-based) systems: Bank accounts = white and cash = black, right? Then, looking forward a decade or two: Given that the system you describe would give governments more insight (control?) than the current system does, do you believe that it's actually cash that's in danger of getting banned - more so than bitcoin?

**In fact, I'd say that the panic over malleability took its effect on the markets and was over within a week or two.**
Yup, I agree with that, which is why I tried clarifying that my point was to answer your first question, not to contest the rest of your post. ;-)
Btw, did Tibanne ever _officially_ state that it was due to the transaction malleability 'bug', specifically, that they lost their BTC?

To clarify, my answer was a direct reply only to your first question, "Which part of the Gox situation is FUD?".
Here's (part of) what Tibanne said about their loss, and which you can still find in the 2014-02-28 PDF at mtgox.com:
"At the start of February 2014, illegal access through the abuse of *a bug in the bitcoin system* resulted in an increase in incomplete bitcoin transfer transactions and we discovered that there was a possibility that *bitcoins had been illicitly moved through the abuse of this bug*.
As a result of our internal investigation, we found that a large amount of bitcoins had disappeared. Although the complete extent is not yet known, we found that approximately 750,000 bitcoins deposited by users and approximately 100,000 bitcoins belonging to us had disappeared.
We believe that there is a high probability that these *bitcoins were stolen as a result of an abuse of this bug* and we have asked an expert to look at the possibility of a criminal complaint and undertake proper procedures."
I saw this referenced in a lot of media outlets and still hear about this "bitcoin bug" from less knowledgeable people. In my mind, that's _the part of the Gox situation which is FUD_. Skillfully executed FUD, swallowed hook, line and sinker by many.

Agreed. But if at first you want to explain mining, try this:
Think of the Excel file as a gigantic, ever-expanding jigsaw puzzle. Each piece in this puzzle is called a "block".
The process of finding a new piece that fits the puzzle is called "mining".
(That's the essence of mining.)
...but if they want you to go on, you may continue like this:
Finding new pieces is important because it's the only way to update the Excel file; the pieces have inscribed upon them the "transactions" that modify the list of account balances. Once placed, the pieces stay there forever, unchanged, for everyone to see.
Now, this particular puzzle comes with an insane amount of puzzle pieces (2^256 to be precise), so finding one that fits is HARD (unless you are EXTREMELY lucky). That's why announing a matching piece (to the peer-to-peer network) is sometimes called "proof of work"; whoever finds one of the very few(!) suitable pieces can simply be assumed to have done a lot of work in order to find it.
So, if contributing to this puzzle is A LOT of work, why would anyone do it? Because every time a new piece is added to the puzzle, the finder is rewarded with a fistful of Bitcoin for his work.
This is the ONLY way new Bitcoins are "minted", thus ensuring that noone can arbitrarily decree Bitcoins into existence (i.e. no central bank; no "printing money", no fiat). This process derives its name from its likeness with real life mining: You convert "work" into "gold" at a somewhat random rate. The more miners, the less gold for each. And the more gold that has been found, the more work it takes to find the remaining.
Now, armed with these abstractions, you could go on explaining why valid blocks are hard to find but easy to validate, how this process ensures digital scarcity, why Satoshi Nakamoto cannot create or destroy Bitcoins at will, what blockchain forks mean, why bitcoin is said to be transparent, how bitcoin adjusts the difficulty (i.e. adjusts the "rounded tabs and blanks" of the pieces so that a smaller or greater number of them will fit) to average the time-to-next-block to 10 minutes regardless of the number of miners, etc.
