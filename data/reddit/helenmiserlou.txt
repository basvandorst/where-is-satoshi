just send your coin to a friend's Coinbase account (free), and get him to withdraw to his bank.
@_date: 2018-01-28 03:59:08
...versus how much to move to another wallet directly from CB?
@_date: 2018-01-01 18:53:46
which is a better policy than Coinbase, which keeps on taking 'em despite being incapable of verifying them all.

(i'd be willing to post old monthly charts with my buy and sell locations--for educational purposes.)

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:35:39

what a piece of shit you are.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:29:51
hmm.  
electronics do nothing but lose value: you traded BTC today (which is almost certain to increase from here) at its near-lowest December price for something which *is* certain to devalue.  
and you traded your car 2 or 3 weeks ago for BTC, coincidentally, at its all-time-high value: your profit from that is now worth around 30% less!

@_date: 2017-12-02 18:53:51
...why "say" 7000? it was between $7600 and 7900 two weeks ago.
...now let's *say* he bought 0.35 at 7800: that's *$2730*.  
        
OK...so let's then *say* he held until the price reached 11000: that's *$3850*. yeah, $1120 by holding is better than $750 through trading.  
but, still, holding "profit" doesn't mean shit until you sell: if the price suddenly drops back to two-weeks-ago levels...well, now you got nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:23:46
...i'd love to see a list of your buys and sells over the past couple of weeks.  
while i'm quite sure you could have gained $750 by snagging a couple of good dips...your 1-2% strategy sounds like bullshit--besides also being insanely foolish (i. e. throwing away money).  
 
the only reason people day-trade BTC is that they think they can beat holding--which this year has proved *almost impossible* to beat. the risk/reward of trading at 2% margins is just plain stupidity. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:47:32
selling too low and then missing the chance to jump back on the train is the biggest danger (that was made most obvious last week).  
as for dips, i'd just say: * never go all-in at one price ... since you very likely will see a better one in a few minutes, hours, or days.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:58:53
...what taxes?  
and the difference between paying, let's say, 10% on $100 ten times versus 10% on $1000 once...is *what*?  
i don't think you know how percentages work.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:31:34
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:18:04
here's my best advice: it applies to crypto...and roulette...and many other things.  
1. $400 is not enough money to make trading worth your time.  
2. **start pretend-trading *NOW*.** it's free ... and it will give you a less-painful insight into how difficult it is to make good guesses.  
- make "buys" and "sells" and record them in a file.  
- don't cheat: look at the real buy and sell prices on exchanges and factor in the trading fees that will cut into your profits.  
- notice how much time your money remains locked up while you wait for the price to rise or fall; also read up on the delays that are involved in moving your money between banks, cards, and exchanges.  
- meanwhile, compare your trading profits with what you would have gained just by holding.

@_date: 2017-12-02 23:04:32
um...yes. never heard of Paypal, Western Union, etc, etc, etc?  
people send money around the world every day from Walmart for crying out loud. yes, you have a fee. ...but you have one with crypto, too. services cost, and that's all there is to it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:55:13
why stress over 10 or 20,000?  because they're thinking about reality...and you're thinking about fairy tales.  
Bitcoin is nothing without traders, so shut the fuck up.

...pretty sure the Satoshi Nakamoto works at the NSA.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:36:49
...because everyone already knows: your crypto *is* counterfeit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:02:24
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.  
the only thing that got crypto any interest outside of geek forums in the beginning was the sudden value explosion ... and that's the only reason it was resurrected this year.  
ironically, while it was dead circa 2014-2016--i.e. stable like an actually usable *currency*--no one gave two fucks about it...and it didn't change shit. that was your chance, but nothing happened.  
now the grown-ups are taking over: they're gonna make as much money as they can until it runs off a cliff and dies for good.  
get real, man.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:43:10
...next year is all that matters.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:08:35

@_date: 2017-12-03 00:22:17

@_date: 2017-12-11 01:29:52
nah. ...merely one of the Pharisees.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:24:28
i didn't miss the point. ...you asked for day-trading advice, and i gave it--based on personal experience.  
i started--for fun and for profit--when BTC was around $4200.  
i started with too little capital and consistently sold at too low and bought at too high.  
...i've personally witnessed how holding would have been better in my case almost every time, but it's undeniable that *sometimes* you should sell and buy back.  
*trying* to beat the Hodl perhaps may be kinda fun...but far more often than not, trading will have you tearing out your hair over missed opportunities.  
that's all i'm saying.

@_date: 2017-12-27 21:50:06

i thought $8000 was too risky to buy back in at. Big Mistake!

that mentality is mostly due to laziness, incompetence, cowardice, and hive-mind. it's also just a meme and also just a scam.  
luckily for those clowns, this year has proven the strategy to be extremely successful...though, obviously, there have been several times where Hodl/Sell/Capitalize has been a better strategy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:24:45
...i think a lot of people claimed it was anonymous
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:36:01
some crashes and dips have been quite easy to predict, though when selling is always on your mind, it's takes a lot of nerve not to jump too early--and then miss the train while waiting for a dip.  
an ever-increasing wallet is the ultimate HODL, but it's extremely tough to guess correctly time after time.

...well, i was believing you until you said that.  
seliing BTC at &lt;+2% and buying at &gt;-2% during the *past two weeks*? there just wasn't that kind of volatility: it was close to a constant rise. there were only 3 or 4 good dips in which money could be made.  
and what kind of fees were you paying?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:53:02
...so you bought in in mid-July, fearlessly held all the way *through* the ATH--during which time you even *accepted* Bitcoin as payment for your physical assets--only to a couple weeks later start throwing it away at dramatically deflated rates?

[incidentally, i think it would be worthwhile to find out how many of these restaurants that have normalized this absurd tax rate are, in fact, *owned* by those very same "cheap" Asians.]  
...i know in the U.S. that Indians and "Asians" are today the wealthiest ethnic groups--as they quite possibly are in many other countries--but this is pure sampling error.  
These immigrants (and 2nd-genners) are the cream of the crop: it's not *chance* that the most successful of them are working in the West rather than in some street market in an obscure third-world country.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:42:30
...well, it *is* impressive (disturbing)
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:30:43
...so, then, you're expecting BTC to go to $1,000,000 or something?  
if you're telling me now the homeless are investing our spare change in crypto, i'd be impressed...but i have to doubt that.  
(but i'd be more impressed if i heard that homeless people were using spare change in actually wise and responsible ways.) 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:46:07

so you don't want to give any of that to the government...but, essentially, it's not doing anything for *you* either while held.  
(also, has anyone *paid* tax on crypto gains yet? ...we all very soon will be though.)
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:15:14

@_date: 2017-11-02 03:30:54
it's varying wildly even now...and no matter what their official excuse is, i'm certain it's bullshit. a few weeks back i was trying to figure out the buy/spot/sell disparity and for BTC, ETH, and LTC, it was roughly 0.5% above and 0.5% below.   
and now it's just absurd: pure greedy profiteering.  
a class-action lawsuit is going to be necessary.

(as far as "losing" 10%--or whatever--of your money...the only way that actually happens is if *you* sell/use your BTC when it's down. ...it's like if you had this enchanted wallet that you kept your cash in--and every night, if you left your money in it, while you were sleeping, it would magically increase or decrease. it's the risk you choose to take: if you want to wake up to the same amount of money every morning, then just leave it out on the table.)

  * the one exception to this, though, would be *if* when you wanted to "buy" something--i.e. barter one commodity for another--you checked and saw that BTC was at a very high price (and, therefore, about to *fall*): in this case, it might actually be quite thrifty of you to dump your crypto.  
Example: you want something that costs $100.  
you see that BTC is trading very high, so you choose it to pay.  
the next day your prediction turns out to be accurate, and that amount of BTC is now only worth $90.  
(at this point, preferably, you then *buy back* your crypto with fiat.)

...tell that to Detroit.

proof of concept, dude.  
...if you were holding coins as of January 2018--regardless of how you bought them--it's pretty likely your portfolio is *down*.  
now we're finally crawling out of the crash...but it's still a bear market. gains right now are a bit hard to come by--and interest payments make it that much harder.  
hodling and taking out crazy loans was last year's strategy.  
right now, the smart guys are making money daytrading.  
this is to say: by the end of February, it should be clear whether you know what you're doing or not.  
...it's *possible* that you could be down and in debt for a couple months and *not* be an idiot...but, by default, every investor is an idiot until *proven* otherwise.

...what do you think the BTC's for?

this year's idiot was last year's genius

...and, fortunately, not a scam at all.

Good Guy Coinbase.

still...at what mark-up? by the time of the peak, surely that extra percentage amounted to well over $1000 of missed profit.  
why on Earth not buy on a real exchange?

as groceries vary in price every week store to store, how do you know you're not wasting any potential BTC profit you're making by misspending your food money each month?

(used my bank account to buy some BTC at &lt;$4800. ...still won't see it until Tuesday--hopefully.)

(thought that might be a necessary clarification. let's say: snail mail...or AOL Mail--on dial-up)
@_date: 2017-10-03 19:16:17
...yeah...but ya coulda tried again or bought somewhere else.  
(and, come on, you wouldn't have held those coins!)
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:03:41


technically, it's not the same: because you're not gonna get a full $1000--unless someone pays you cash.  
and, beyond that, it's not at all the same: because you haven't said how much you originally paid for the coin.

...best not to exclude any genders: how about Pedopia?
@_date: 2018-02-11 05:59:07
1. ...the fuck did you buy that much on localbitcoins?!
@_date: 2017-10-08 08:31:02
yeah, but how many businesses could just sit on a fourth of their profit for a whole year?
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:12:33
yeah, Coinbase isn't a full-on bankrobber--just a petty thief. 
No worries :)
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:54:01
go look at the chart *right now*.    
the answer is either *HELL NO*  
...or Yes yes yes yes yes

The Bitcoins.
