we could raise the block limit — *oh wait*

try going through GDAX first, they might pay for your fees
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:03:48
paying $10 fees for a $9 game is ridiculous, that’s why
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:40:20
other currencies have raised the limit (e.g. bitcoin cash has 8mb limit I believe) but it’s really only a temporary scaling solution. 
there are arguments that bigger block size leads to more centralization as well.
head over to r/btc too, they have a different view than you’re gonna get here. it’s best to get your info from multiple places since this sub is heavily “moderated” 
edit: phrasing 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:34:53
thank fuck, a decent answer. 
this helps a lot, thanks for explaining. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:12:06
wait it’s hovering above $13k right now
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:14:18
interesting concept, but what the fuck is that thumbnail
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:18:22
oh true this whole arbitrage thing is adding to confusion 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:49:53
how is bitcoin cash centralized?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:36:25
I had to carefully word it so it wouldn’t get automatically removed lol
@_date: 2017-12-29 09:54:48
that’s a glitch
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:17:17
you’ll get banned/c e nsor ed here if you complain too loudly. 
r/btc loves to complain about how much bitcoin has gone down the drain. there’s some good (and bad, like any subreddit) discussion over there
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:34:10
we did. they all got silenced or banned from the sub by speaking out about it
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:27:33
...how would you go about reducing the power consumption then?
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:50:02
This article is focusing the economics of bitcoin, not really the underlying technology. 
It makes completely valid points that shouldn’t be dismissed just because it’s “criticizing bitcoin”
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:39:31
1) alt accounts
2) not gonna lie, that just made my day that someone actually thought I was getting paid to reddit lmao
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:51:30
I think you have to wait 48 hours to withdraw from the vault 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:32
why is everyone pretending that BCH is the only coin that gets manipulated??
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:12:46
Also OP I’d recommend using ethereum or litecoin instead. You’ll save money and time since the bitcoin network is so congested right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:40:57
fair point. I forgot I wasn’t in r/cryptocurrency 
it’ll be interesting to see how this all plays out 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:57:25
I don’t see what’s wrong with this. She’s not familiar with crypto, and when consulting with someone to help her move the funds safely, it *is* easy for the bitcoin to be stolen. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:41:10
I think bitcoin cash is still an altcoin. 
I just don’t think it’s constructive for crypto in general to start these naming wars trying to delegitimize certain coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:55:28
lol dude I literally asked you for a counter argument, I’m obviously open to discussion on this. 
It’s clear you don’t have anything to add other than being butthurt 
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:53:28
I don’t get this though. It’s literally a hardfork off of bitcoin, it came from the same blockchain. 
if there was some erc-20 token called “Bitcoin &lt;blah&gt;” and claimed to be the real bitcoin then I’d be upset too. 
but this is a hardfork. we shouldn’t call it “bcash” the same way Bitcoin shouldn’t be called “bcore” or “bitcoin segwit”
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:41:16
a lot of people do but then get silenced or banned when they ask about why bitcoin has gone from a p2p electronic cash system (as outlined in the white paper) to just a store of value
but yeah I agree that people need to understand at least the basics of blockchain technology in general before vomiting opinions everywhere 
edit: more info
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:49:58
if any bitcoin fork started threatening Bitcoin, then core/blockstream supporters would start a social media campaign against said fork...as evidenced by the OP
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:21:18
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:54:14
do you have a counter argument? what am I missing if I’m so “ignorant”
and dismissing my claim because of the age of my alt account doesn’t address anything
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:52:45
unfortunately you’re not gonna get any organic discussion concerning these issues here :/
@_date: 2017-09-21 06:32:42
I'm not savvy enough to help you. But, be VERY careful how you handle getting help from other people. Someone might offer help and say something like "why don't you send me a pic of the seed and I'll see if I can figure it out". Next thing you know the btc is gone forever. Be careful
@_date: 2017-09-24 00:37:43
I just had 5 strokes and an aneurism 
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:55:29
okay that’s what I originally thought regarding bigger blocks, but I’ll probably get banned if I even mention 2x or bitcoin ca h as viable alternatives
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:05:52
litecoin, bitcoin cash, pretty much any other coin that has lower fees and faster confirmations 
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:51:55
gotcha. 
I’m not trynna say bitcoin cash = bitcoin. just trying to avoid confusion since “bitcoin cash” has less ambiguity vs. “bcash” which has different meanings depending on who you ask (it’s confusing when you browse both r/ bitcoin and r/ btc lol)
With all these forks I figured it’s better to be as explicit as possible with names to avoid any confusion 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:42:22
I’m not sure how bcash works. Has it even forked off of Zcash yet?
Edit: just checked and bcash doesn’t launch until 2018
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:26:57
why not both? (correct me if I’m wrong but that’s what segwit2x would provide?)
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:57:46
close; chemical formula for zolpidem tartrate (aka ‘ambien’)
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:48:57
yeah I’m pretty new and trying to find my bearings.
thanks for the resources, I’ll check them out!
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:29:30
I’m so confused. I keep hearing that the users are the ones in control but this obviously isn’t the case right now. It really worries me that bitcoin is gaining publicity now from the price increases, but people will be *immediately* turned off by over 80k unconfirmed transactions. 
Can someone help me understand this? I’m trying to get my friends on board with bitcoin.
