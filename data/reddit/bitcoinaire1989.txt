Bitcoins is a Zero sum game. Therefore there are winners and losers when a new disruptive technology enters the framework. We can all agree that Bitcoin makes a lot of the services that banks provide obsolescent to some degree. Therefore most banks/financial service companies will oppose bitcoin/crypto currency. However you can still make money providing bitcoin related services, hence why some banks will have an incentive to cheat on the incumbent power structures that exist in the market place (I.e. Game theory).
I think Saxo Bank might be one of the first major banks to start cheating ;), which might break the banks cartel on financial services? AMA

I agree with you to a large extent. There will be many winners (i.e. the public). However the banking industry is a multi trillion dollar industry, so you will get a few very big incumbent losers (i.e. JP morgan and Goldman Sachs).

Let's assume you are right, and a bad actor outside is trying to compromise the bitcoin network. What value does bitcoin have it anybody can clog up the network/compromise the capacity of the network using a trivial/insignificant amount of money/btc.  
Wasn't Bitcoin designed to be resistant to outside influence.
Seems pretty vulnerable without 2mb + Segwit + Lightning

" the userbase for bitcoin is basically crazy libertarians who are increasingly poorly-informed about currency systems and macroeconomics". 
To stereotype the whole community as crazy libertarians is just plain lazy journalism! It seems he's poorly informed himself. 
Since when do you need to be a libertarian to disagree with corruption in our financial system? I'm not a libertarian and have a economics degree from Aston University, but I guess I'm just poorly-informed!

What will happen if all of the transaction are forced off chain ?
How will the miners generate enough transaction fees of a 1mb block...
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:44:06
Maybe more people just want to use the network.
If you look at the rate of adoption over the past couple of years it isn't surprising that we have reached this point.

Virtual currency bitcoin has been recognized by the German Finance Ministry as a “unit of account”, meaning it is now legal tender and can be used for tax and trading purposes in the country.

Forex is a Zero sum game. If you sell Euro's for Dollars, the Dollar price in relation to Euro's will go up. I know this, as I trade Forex!
Definition "A situation in which one person’s gain is equivalent to another’s loss, so the net change in wealth or benefit is zero. A zero-sum game may have as few as two players, or millions of participants. Zero-sum games are found in game theory, but are less common than non-zero sum games".
PS: I did not imply that bitcoins can't coexist next to stocks, bonds and currencies. In fact with the emergence /development of coloured coins, I think they go hand in hand. Furthermore, I don't think bitcoins will replace normal Fiat, but instead act as an alternative to FIAT. Having a Math based deflationary currency as an alternative will make it more apparent when government do try and debase the own currency for various reasons. This will provide the consumer with greater choice, as well as keep existing currencies in check. AMA

I think you are right with what you are saying, but when you engage with toxic people in a tit for tat argument, you lose yourself.
It costs you time, energy and distracts you from the bigger picture.

Bitcoin hasn't got the divine right to be number 1 without merit.
The lack of progress and compromise on the scaling debate (from both sides) has caused a lot of participants within the community to jump ship.
Sounds like you're complacent.
Seg Wit + 2mb would do it I think

I use to go out my way to use bitcoin, now I find it slow, expensive and cumbersome.
I hope both sides agree to a compromise soon, as inaction will inevitably lead to a slow and painful death....
RIP bitcoin :(

Satoshi built Bitcoin as an alternative to the current financial system, not a Swift like settlement network. Even though I am a proponent of multiple scaling solutions (especially SegWit and LN), by trying to push the the majority of TXs offchain you get rid of the incentive of the miners to secure the network. This becomes a ever more apparent problem as the block reward continues to half.
The reason I liked bitcoin is that it allows you to transfer value without a third party involved, LN operators will increasing become more and more centralized.
 
I am not a subscriber to R/Btc, but I don't see the point in using a payment network that has so much friction only rich white guys can use ?
A factory worker in Ethiopia makes just £0.15 an hour, why would they use bitcoin today?
Bitcoin was meant to be about the other 7 billion unbanked people on earth ?

The chinese governent limits the amount of capital each citizen can transfer out of the country each year to $50k.
This limit resets tomorrow.
If the yuan usd rate exchange rate increases to 7, we may see bitcoin go through 1000 usd.
Whether this will happen within the next 48 hours or not, idk?
Regardless 2017 will be a great year for bitcoin.
Happy new year !!! To the moon !!!

Bitcoin was created by Satoshi as a response to the financial crisis. 
Satoshi wanted to give everyone (on earth) a cheap friction-less alternative to the current financial systems.
Seing as the median TXs cost is already above the average hourly Wage of a Ethiopian factory worker, bitcoin is becoming a novelty for rich white men.....
RIP :( bitcoin

To set up and close a payment channel on the LN, you need to broadcast a OnChain transaction, therefore the LN is  dependent on the settlement layer/blocksize.
I like LN, but it will never work effectively without a blocksize increase, as the majority of payments the average user makes are not reoccurring.

The price is going down now, because the market anticipated a greater level of support for seg wit and a greater level of consensus on scaling in the future.
Let's hope the community comes to some sort of compromise and stops the civil war.
Otherwise the price will drop much further!
