It's called FOMO. You don't buy after *months of hype*. You buy before the hype even starts ideally, or when the hype is still very early days and only happens within tight communities (not on CNN).

Then stock investments are the gambling, too. You can't know which company will succeed in the long term. Google? Tesla? Facebook? Snapchat? It's all a "gamble" of various degrees.
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:22:39
Of course not. Do we even have to ask this question at this point?
Altcoins will continue to grow in number because it's also a way for various technology companies to get funding. There's no reason the number of altcoins (or tokens) will diminish.

This is hilarious. Remember when a lot of people loved Coinbase a few weeks ago?
Bitcoin and all cryptos need decentralized exchanges.

When is Bitcoin going to adopt Monero's anonymity features? Wasn't anonymity promised from like day one for Bitcoin, but never actually delivered because for too long people thought the pseudonimity of ransom string addresses was enough?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:09:44
Won't the Lightning network doing much of the same for Bitcoin, though?

That's because it's so new, not because nobody wants it.
lowRISC will be for sale soon:

It's $20,000 in total, not per transaction.

That's the point - the IRS was trying to get everyone's data in bulk. Coinbase fought that, but their "victory" was minimal in the end, because IRS could still get the data of 14,000 people at once. This is what most people here never seemed to understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:42:03
OMG. They've been living among us this *whole time*?!
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:19:26
Did you miss the part where the records of 14,000 people were turned over?

Exactly, and the IMF plans to take advantage of this, as do other governments. It's now or never for Bitcoin to adopt Monero-like privacy features by default. 
It's time for the Bitcoin community to start taking this seriously and demand those features from the developers. Those features are not going to come by themselves. Put pressure on developers.
Technology can be used to both liberate and oppress people. We now see that the governments have started realizing that they could use the internet to oppress people and they don't have to ban it or shut it down anymore. They can use the internet to spy on people, attack and discredit them, spread propaganda and brainwash them, and so on.
The same is going to happen to "blockchain" technologies soon. It's kind of laughable that some people think that China "adopting blockchain" is good news (like I saw yesterday on Of course China is only going to adopt blockchain if it thinks it can give it even *more* control over its people - not *less*.

Not sure if serious or sarcastic. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:02:30
Remind me again, why isn't everyone on board with Bitcoin gaining Monero-like privacy features? It should have done it years ago.
I fear that if the developers/community wait any longer, governments will soon *expect* cryptocurrencies to be [100% traceable]( The fight to make Bitcoin private will be too difficult then. It's time to do something about it, now.

Looks to me like the C could be quite a bit longer down, though.

TA is a *consequence* of the events in the market.
The candles don't just move up and down because people feel like doing that in a day or another. I mean to a degree that also happens, but it's largely due to events happening around that time.
So when green candles keep popping on the screen, it's because people heard some stuff that makes them want to be bullish and buy more Bitcoins. Similarly, when they panic, they do it because they heard the news that Bitcoin might work. So the TA shows very bullish candles and trends.
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:59:17
They're using that advanced "we're HODLing all of your money" technology.

Yeah, I prefer this over the other snapshot.

Small government (stealing from you) at work.

That's why we need to call for Monero-like features in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:37:03
Speaking of which, when are we going to push for Monero-like privacy features in Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:56:01
You probably don't want to hear this now, but did you not get to read any advice online about "not investing more than you can afford to lose" before you put your life's savings into Bitcoin?
That advice people keep giving it isn't some parroted mumbo jumbo that people keep repeating because they don't know any better. It can actually save a lot of people from being in your situation. Cryptocurrencies don't always go up, and even if they do, you can still have your money hacked from "reputable exchanges" or you can lose your private keys, and so on. That's why you don't risk it all. Because catastrophy is always *just around the corner* in the cryptocurrency world.

Miner support was not the point of UASF, dude. It's users/client support that it needs. But of course it's a lot easier to bring together the majority of the top 10 miners on a proposed solution and pass it than it is to bring together the majority of Bitcoin users.
To me SegWit 2x is proof that Bitcoin is no longer decentralized. It's owned by a handful of miners now and they alone can decide Bitcoin's future.
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:56:52
Yeah, also the biggest advantage of the secure element is that the private key is kept in a simple (non-complex/harder to bypass) hardware component, with not much getting access to it at all, so it's much more secure.

Almost rich sounds a lot better than broke.

You don't think this type of regulations will come to muh-terrism America?

So Jihan will end-up ruling Bitcoin while backstabbing the SegWit protocol is what you're saying.

Would you say those two are more or less safe than Bitstamp?
Also, I noticed some of these exchanges offer their own debit card. But doesn't that have to go through a local bank account or whatever? How does that work?
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:05:17
Isn't the "majority of miners" just Bitmain in terms of hashing power? Do you trust BitMain alone to secure the networks? To me this sounds more and more like a government takeover, rather than a corporate takeover. But it's all in the shadows. I would be very surprised if the Chinese government wasn't backing Bitmain in some way, including by influencing certain points of view on this subreddit with their propaganda machine.

Do people actually see this as a "win"? This is an overreach by the IRS. They should be coming with warrants for every single one of those accounts. Are they able to just go to JP Morgan and say "we want to see all of your accounts that have traded over $20,000 in the past two years", too?
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:49:51
It's under 9000!

Why the f- shouldn't the Fed be audited?
And spare me of the "but we don't want to politicize the Fed!" excuse. This is about transparency and ensuring that at least things are going as the Fed says they are going.
It's not about giving Congress monetary control. But if the Fed happens to create a few trillion out of thin air and lend it to the banks, we should know about it.
@_date: 2017-06-07 15:43:22
Sorry, the first part isn't clear. Are you saying Gemini has better consumer protections or Bitstamp does? I would be surprised if Germini (US-based) does as opposed to Bitstamp (UK and Luxembourd-based, but it seems also US-based).
And that's good information about the debit cards taking money directly from the exchange deposits. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:04:27
This may help:
Some of them should only allow you to verify phone number, but the money limit depends for each. You may want to take a closer look at BitPanda.

No, those are the FOMOers.

Indeed. Even though I think there will be *many* hacks on the network, or at least in the DAPPs because of that Turing completeness, and although it may shake the community a little in the beginning, I think eventually it will just be noise in the background, much like data breaches on internet websites are these days. 
I will definitely suck for the people getting hacked and losing all of their ether, though...

0.001 BTC per transaction at $2500 is way better than 0.001 BTC per transaction at $500.
