Now she is pretty involved in our crypto investments. 
She told me to buy litecoin back when it was about 20.I never said "no", but I just never went through with it.
She even made a couple trades while I was at work upon my request that earned us about 400 in bitcoin cash.

My wife didnt talk to me for weeks after i bought some at 370.00
@_date: 2018-09-05 20:17:52
Not really. a year ago it was 1k
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:30
Heres the whole story. 
I wanted to buy one whole coin and she told me i should only spend 100$. I told her ok, and just went ahead and bough a whole coin at 371.00. She saw the bank statement the next day and got pretty pissed.
She still talked to me but was pretty steamed for weeks and during this time I would mention how much the value was rising.
Now she jokes that I should have went and bought about 10...

I want to take my coin out of coinbase and into my own wallet. What is a good hardware wallet to use? Should i use just a basic thumbdrive?
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:35:51
Ive been watching bitcoin VERY closely for the past 4 years. Its very easy to make safe trades that bring in around 50 buks a day (for me). 
I am one with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:46:31
Bought at 370 btw. Wife was very pissed i spent 370 on "fake money". My nob is now polished.
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:40:19
Tempting, but they say dont invest in anything you cant afford to lose. Im gonna ask my wife what she thinks about a bitcoin loan
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:07:08
