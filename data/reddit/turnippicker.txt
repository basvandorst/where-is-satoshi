Errrm this is definitely legit, I've got a fair bit of money's worth seemingly stuck in limbo and would quite like to know if I will ever get it back. I don't quite understand why I'd have a reason to lie about this anyway...I've been scouring the internet forever and a day to try and find out how bitcoins/blockchain works and this has been by far the most informative. 
This is my first time ever on Reddit and I have no idea why I've been banned. I've sent a message to the mods.
Such a strange accusation. Disinformation about an unconfirmed transaxtion.......? How would that advantage anyone in any way - maybe there are things I don't know about eh.

Just realised that first sentence made absolutely no sense. I meant to say 'sorry about the transaction that seems to have been lost from several years back'

Sorry the transaction that you seem to have been lost from several years back - that seems absolutely crazy?! I'm really confused about this 72 hour time frame; is anyone able to tell me what exactly happens 72 hours afterwards if no rebroadcast happens?
I'm clearly no expert but I don't think it's possible to add additional miners fees to a transaction that has already been broadcast to the blockchain. It is confusing though, even if the rules were different when you made you're transaction, surely as your transaction has not been rebroadcast for 72 hours it would be returned?
Sorry for being so clueless, this bitcoin business is confusing as hell!!

Thanks for the comments guys.
After I started reading up about it, I realised that my fee was way too low. Strangely, I've been making regular transactions every couple of months and never encountered this before (99% sure my fee was the same).
From your comments then, am I correct in thinking that the BTC will be returned to my wallet if the transaction is still unconfirmed after 3 days? At which time, I can just resend with a higher fee?
Thanks again

Just another quick question too. How do I prevent rebroadcast? I'd rather just wait out the 3 days and re-sending with a higher fee then dragging it out any longer than needed.
I read somewhere that if you have your BTC client open, it will rebroadcast every 30 mins or so?

Just seen this reply, thanks for your help buddy. This is my first transaction this year so that may explain why my previous ones went through without an issue. 
I'll just wack the fee bar to the top once it gets returned, hopefully that'll do the trick!
Thanks again man, really appreciated.

Especially for people who are new to the world of BTC, it takes a fair bit of research (and Reddit questions) to find all of this out! Just to confirm guys, after 72 hours my bitcoins will be returned to my wallet?
