I think that is also a good idea, especially because it doesn't separate people based on economic issues. While the younger net-savy crowd often debate things like taxes, practically all of them agree want freedom of information and freedom of communication.

I assume it is a chicken and egg problem, which makes a reddit bot arguable a lot more effective then a new website. A lot of people already ask for help here, and a lot of people already give help, so it would be fairly easy to throw a few dollars worth of bitcoins into the mix.

Governments have done good and bad things. Leftists are not unaware that the War on Drugs is done by the state, but their response is to try to change the government rather than abolish it completely. Similar to the way government doing something nice to you does not compel you to support everything the state does; government doing a bad thing to leftists does not mean they have to abolish the state.

It doesn't need a discussion. If someone didn't want to use the word "libertarian" because of its left-wing history, then it should be reasonably obvious that "neoliberal" is not a replacement - because it contains the same problem.

Using "worship" is a clever way of making your side look rational, and the other side look like cultists.
But since that attitude comes across as insulting, it isn't effective if we want to change their minds. For example, if someone told me I worshiped free markets, I would not take the rest of his ideas seriously.

Have you looked at the history of the word "neoliberalism"? it suffers from the same problem as the word "libertarian", of having its meaning purposefully shifted (both directions in this case).
@_date: 2012-12-20 03:46:01
This is speculation. But I suspect 
1. There are two groups of people, ones who think anonymous currency transactions are a good thing, typically right libertarians with a notable minority of left ones. And ones who think it is a bad thing, types who support war on drugs, gambling regulation, high tax on alcohol and so on. It is hard to control people's behavior when there is no good way to keep track of what they are doing.
2. The former have an interest in seeing the popularity of bitcoins rise.
3. The former have a problem, if the latter group fully mobilizes about whats going on, they could use their armies of soccer moms and other nanny-state types to attempt to regulate or ban cryptocurrency.
4. While this is completely unfeasible (short of banning the net completely, even then...), a huge amount of resources (including criminal convictions) would be wasted by attempting to do so.
5. Politically, regulating cryptocurrency becomes harder over time. First because more people will be using it, making it hard to demonize its users. Second, because as people realize how encryption works, more people will be aware of it being a lost cause. 
So statements like "bitcoins are not anonymous at all" may simply be from people ignorant of things like TOR; but it could also be damage control by the former group - stalling the latter group long enough to stop them doing anything stupid.

So my advice is yes. I think there's is potential here. You could even use the reputation you build to manage a firm which provides budget 'unlicensed' services, taking a cut of their payment for checking their advice, something like that. 
You might be the first lawyer to actually try this stuff.
I think there's also an opening market for contract disputes between two anonymous private-key parties. A reputable firm could arbitrate them. That idea is also written about in the book.
I don't know enough about law to be more creative here, but there might be other ways to produce more efficient law advice that would be illegal in person.

He could give free advice for a while using a digitally signed messages. Since only he would have the private key to those messages, he will be able to prove his identity. People will eventually be able to tell if he's a real lawyer by seeing if his advice works. Once he builds up a reputation he can start charging for advice.

"Tonight the server will be down from midnight onwards for approximately 4 hours while we migrate our servers over. You can withdraw BTC from the site, but withdrawing GBP won't do anything and in fact might hinder the operating of the site.

Hopefully this is the last non-smooth upgrade since there was no other way to do this non destructively for UK domain names."

I think the use of 'truecrypt' and 'antivirus' are slightly misleading. Wouldn't it be designed so that the whole (open-sourced/checked) operating system is on a read-only-memory chip? The result could be a very small device which fits in your palm.
I also don't necessarily think you need offline backups if you use encryption. You could just upload it to a website (i.e. email it to yourself), they'd be no way to crack it without your password. Though keeping a USB stick around with an encrypted version is useful too.

I'm expecting them to not go up much in the short term. But I also expect that in several years people will be asking something like "will bitcoins go back up to 500$ again or will they stay they low at 300?"
The reason being is that my optimism is based on how I think it will change society eventually. There are future theoretical uses of encrypted currency which I think people are underestimating the impact of. The short term in comparison is driven by speculation, which I don't know enough about to predict.

Two additional notes:

I don't understand why you can't adjust the loan for deflation - for a 0% loan you could agree to pay back the number of bitcoins which would buy the same bundle of goods (eg. steel, precious metals, random assets to cancel out price fluctuations), hence paying back less bitcoins but returning the same amount of material wealth.
It seems like a loan would require more calculations, but not a "no loans at all" situation, which your post implies.

If you look at the page you linked you will find a large number of economic articles published in prestigious journals, a professorship of economics at UCLA, and the author of a price theory textbook which, despite not being the main one in the field, had been used to teach micro for decades. His specialty in law is in the economics of law.

Did you know theres a chapter in the book which describes that?
One solution to prevent a 1984 dystopia is to put the state under the same surveillance (flying bugs and so on) as the people are under. That seems like an effective solution to me, though it it going to radically change how humans everywhere act, since nearly everyone will have to be honest. On the positive side, something seems profound about being able to play back your entire life. Imagine how the "what awkward/awesome moments do you remember?" askreddit threads will be like.
I think it also requires political activism as we approach that time period - to make sure the technology gets in the hands of everyone, not just government. That is one reason the deep web is so important to me - its a potential way to share the tech to spy on government and a way to share the information database collected. That's assuming they try to suppress it. If the tech becomes a common part of society then it wouldn't necessarily be politically popular to criminalize it, similar to how gun control advocates are having a difficult time at present.
