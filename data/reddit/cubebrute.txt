Anyone on the wrong side of anti-trust laws. Big business may have a lot of influence in the government, but they compete for power. I'd rather that competition stay alive.

You want a system that is guaranteed to be exploitative, but you don't want to exploit others. You are a sheep who chose the wolves on the right over the wolves on the left.


People aren't equal under capitalism, they are measured by their wealth. What exactly would stop an influential or wealthy person from obtaining political power?

Idealistic drivel. Even if we assume monopolies can't be created naturally, that doesn't mean they can't be maintained naturally once established. 


Because intellectual property rights allowed them to profit from it. If you get rid of copyright, software becomes free after the first copy because it can be freely duplicated


Cheap labor is too inefficient? Why do you think so many of our products come from sweatshops? You think that can't come here? Wake up.


They have the most assets too, own the most businesses, don't think for a moment you're leveling the playing field. It's not like it would happen overnight either. They would have plenty of time to buy out of fiat.


I don't get any money if I'm dead but even with the braindead argument, you're still proving my point. People have killed themselves in pursuit of insurance money for family. See Jeffrey Locker, Japanese suicide rates (ins covers suicide there), etc.

No, they just gobble up any infrastructure they don't already own and dominate the market with 0 resistance.


And now nobody has any incentive to create software.


I have no idea what is leading you to this conclusion


You don't buy power from a store. If I have the kind of wealth and power we're talking about I can pay many people to further my interests. If my interests include enslaving people, who is going to stop me? You are depending on the benevolence of the rich. Considering the 3 richest people have more wealth than the bottom 50% of all people, that's a ridiculous amount of power to just offer up and say "Please don't abuse this now that there is nothing to stop you from doing literally whatever you want." It's overwhelming naivety

Anarcho-capitalism will only allow the rich to exploit the poor privately and lawlessly. And you say I'm self-subjugating.


If you're going to label me in terms of wolves and sheep, then I expect the same from you. Wolf or sheep?
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:29:00


We were arguing about starting wealthy vs starting poor in pure capitalist society. Remember? "Those who own the current things would simply have more to lose." The analogy lost meaning when you moved on to talk about cooperative business, which is a strange argument because many of your original arguments were predicated on cost of service being found through free market competition. Now your saying markets aren't competitive and everyone helps each other "win."


You literally asked me how much money I would kill myself for. Signing up for active duty is far different from putting a gun to your own head. Not trying to be a pedant


Likewise, I felt like you moved goalposts and criticized ideals that I never advocated. As though you wanted me to be more socialist so you could show everyone how wrong it is. Felt disingenuous.


I think this wraps neatly to the beginning of our argument. I don't think power voids would ever last long in human society. Even if all government simultaneously disappeared, I don't think it would be a probable outcome. Capitalism isn't a boogeyman, it's just fragile even if you replace money with goods IMO
You can have the last word

I didn't say it was zero-sum, just competitive.


This is blind hope. It's not grounded in reality at all


It's called an example.


No. Not even most people. It was an example of how even though your argument was hyperbolically skewed towards your own reasoning, it was still wrong.


And this is somehow impossible to do if only we had more capitalism?

The free market runs contrary to human interests sometimes. Prisons, healthcare, legislation, and utilities are all perfect examples. Some things are more effectively run by a governing body.


Only in the nightmares of wolves. Nearly nobody thinks the rich are the sheep and the poor are the wolves. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 18:04:02


You're taking the analogy too literally. If I say a tomato is red like a rose you'll argue the differences between fruits and flowers. No shit. It doesn't have to be zero-sum to be competitive. Cooperation and competition exist in the same markets. It's not black and white.


They don't have to be willing to do "anything." This is the problem with looking at everything as though it's black and white. Just because I can't pay people to jump off buildings doesn't mean money doesn't give power. 


Everything that isn't your view is wrong and therefore evil.


All power involves exploitation, even economic power. Stop pretending.

It's just different tyrants. You want capitalism, but all you get is oligarchy, which is what we already have. Special interest groups make all the laws and if you're old enough to vote then your vote is only to make them stronger. 


For-profit prisons are capitalist. No free market use for nearly free labor? Seriously? As far as drug laws go, they certainly aren't the product of a government that represents its people if that's what you're arguing.


Were you not around for healthcare pre-ACA? They would just drop coverage on you if you get sick. Chronic anything? That's not profitable.
Medicare returns a higher amount of funding to benefits than any private insurance carrier. Government healthcare stops working when the money used to run it is taken away. The less funding it has, the more excuses can be made to slash funding. 


Source? Also, if you get rid of public schooling, good luck getting an education if you live in a rural area where private schools are unprofitable. Also, 70% of private schools are religious, so enjoy forced church.


You should move to an anarcho-capitalist country. Oh wait, there isn't a single working model of that.


We already tax the rich, so yes. Probably less than we should, but whatever.


I didn't say that's what I wanted. You're not arguing with me, you're arguing with what you think I think. How pointless. 
I want the government to provide as good an option as it can and for corporations to be forced to compete with that standard. The post office is a government run institution, it provides a basic service to citizens. UPS and Fedex compete with it and provide a better service in some cases. That is good.
Compare that to utilities where there is no government competition, like internet. Satisfaction is way down because business monopolizes and suddenly Comcast is your only option.


Because I'm a sheep that votes for policies that help sheep? Get real. What do you think you are?

I was using football to show that starting positions are not irrelevant to an even playing field. The analogy was fine in the context it was in


No, it isn't. Power isn't only defined by the power to force people to commit suicide. I never defined power like that, you did. Now you're clutching to it like an infant as though it has any meaning.


I disagree with you absolutely. It's just, we've been arguing for three days. I can only repeat myself so many times, I'm pretty sure it's futile.


Except you're wrong. For all the reasons I gave above. 
Anyway, good argument. It was fun, we're both entrenched. Have a good weekend
@_date: 2018-08-03 15:53:18

If we bring that equal rate here, we get to enjoy the same standard of living they enjoy. Have fun with that.


Great, lets play football. We always start on your one yard line. I have so much room behind me to lose.


People committing suicide for an insurance payout to their family isn't essentially paid suicide. Fascinating. 


Why pay people to die when you can pay people to kill? See mercenaries, hitmen etc. Saying money can't buy power is an absolute joke.

You honestly think there would be a void of power? There will always be wolves. You don't think special interests would rule in a pure capitalist society. Dumbest thing you've said all day.


I'm pro-union and anti-lobbying. Ya got me all wrong chum.


Surely getting rid of the government would cause multi-billionaires to have less power. Also, did you mean per dollar? Per capita is used to represent a percentage of the population


How inflammatory. I don't think you even know which is which. You didn't answer. What are you?
I'm not even anti-capitalist. You're just anti-government. It's okay, I was an anarcho-capitalist too when I was 18.

I don't appreciate the strawman. I didn't say anything about democracy. All systems have flaws. With democracy, the problem isn't the number of wolves and sheep, it's how easily sheep are convinced they can be wolves.
