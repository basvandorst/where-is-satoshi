Most of the exploits these companies are using are worth over $250,000. The major intelligence agencies keep these in their back pocket for when they **REALLY** need to spy on somebody. Even the NSA has stated in their documents that they will only use high level exploits if they think the target is not technical enough to find out about it, otherwise their method of attack could be compromised and fixed.
So, do you think someone is going to use a $250,000 exploit to steal your hot wallet? Maybe if you are **THAT** guy that keeps his entire bankroll on your phone, but then you have a lesson coming ANYWAY.
I think as a consequence of bitcoin, we will see much more secure operating systems. (Long Term)
Cold Storage/Off-line Signing is the way to go.

Bitcoin enables the people to audit expenditures (in the manner you suggest). Governments of the world will not be able to sell bonds to central banks to finance projects that in turn pay their way to positions of power (political donations). With bitcoin you must provide a service or resource in exchange for value transfer and value cannot be created or counterfeited. 




If someone steals my wallet today there is no coverage, I can cancel my cards but everything else is gone. Identity theft and credit fraud is a zero sum game, if the bank loses we all lose in higher fees **SOMEWHERE**. In the future bitcoin accounts will most likely covered by similar 'loss' insurance to compete with traditional banking products in this manner.




As soon as the network "shuts down", I will fire up my cpu and start to earn all those free bitcoins!


So are all the air conditioners and heaters in all the banks of the world.




Just outlining the challenges we face ahead of us.




Estimated current network consumption is from 80MW to 1200 MW * 24 hours * 365 days = 10,512,000 MWH per year = **11,512 GWH per year** (in the worst case) Theoretically could be **700.8 GWH per year**.
95,559 bank branches (
I estimated each branch at about 5,000 sq. ft. consuming 187500 BTU for heating/cooling, does not include computers or the coffee maker. (I had other estimates that are 5x but we will use this one) 187500 BTU = 55 KW
55KW used 8 hours a day = 440KWH per day * 365 days = 160600 KWH per year = 160.60 MWH per year * 95559 branches = 15,346,775 MWH per year = **15,346.8 GWH per year**
This is only for the US banks, does not include Europe, Asia, or Australia (other continents probably not negligible)
Also does not include energy expenditures for data centers, day to day operations, moving people to and from the banks, moving cash to and from the banks, etc. Alot of this is abstracted away by digital systems.




**ROFLMAO** On a serious note, by allowing people to transact in currencies that are not stolen or manipulated by powerful entities with guns (im looking at you Africa) the people can start to build a society with a defined and structured economic system that is local but also global. The prosperity of everyone in the first world is automatically transmitted, via bitcoin price, to the second and third worlds. Think of it this way, if the US government was to discover a trillion $ asteroid would the holders of Vietnamese Dong benefit in any way, maybe lower prices in commodity metals but they don't use much anyway. Now what if the company that discovers the trillion $ asteroid deals primarily in BTC, what effect does this have on that economy?




Bitcoin will spread on the fringes of the Internet as it stands today. Poor farmers that sell their goods in large cities might be able to transact, and possibly save in bitcoin. As their business expands due to stable currency valuation and increased demand (more economic activity) these business people will want to stay home and do business. Suddenly the telecom operator has the demand, and the people have the finances to pay for service further from the city. Its like a road, when there is demand for economic activity the road will be built. Same with bitcoin.

Bitcoin Armory and Electrum will do off-line signing of transactions. You basically create the transaction on an online computer, move the transaction to an off-line computer via usb stick/sd card, sign the transaction on the off-line computer, then bring the signed transaction back to the Internet connected computer to transmit to the Internet connected computer.
Any time your private key or an encrypted version of it touches a network connected digital device I would consider it to be 'tainted'. Good for small amounts in a hot wallet but not reliable for large, long term storage.
BIP38 is just password for your private key, it gets reused and I assume it could be changed.

You should read Childhood's End. The basic premise of the book is that aliens make contact with humanity, however they have to take a couple decades or so to get everyone on the planet educated before they feel comfortable revealing themselves (makes sense, since the majority of our global culture is simple and uneducated, an alien presence would possibly scare the piss out of them). Anyway, a global communications network and global currency are certainly 2 ways to advance our global race into the future.
TLDR; Satoshi Nakamoto is an alien who is furthering humanity for eventual contact.

Here is some more data from (1995) 1000 internet users surveyed.
16 Million total internet users in 1995.
That would mean that something like 12 million out of 266 million were using email. (Less than 20%)
I think one issue we will see is that bitcoin replaces services that most people don't **think** they need replaced. Most of us who deal in bitcoin believe it is glaringly obvious how much better bitcoin really is (and we are right) but for the average person it just doesn't stand out like "**THE INTERNET**" did. Overseas adoption will be a tremendous boon to their local economies however.

My intention was not to be arrogant, it was merely to outline some use case scenarios in which people have found bitcoin to be useful. The general population of America (and the rest of the World?) does not fit into those categories, many of the users here fit multiple categories and this is why we use bitcoin. 
I am merely trying to draw a parallel between new technologies, the early adopters that find these technologies to be interesting &amp; advantageous, and later the near ubiquitous adoption of said technology, even by people who never found a good reason to use it besides "everyone else is doing it".

Obviously, but it would seem that the costs of mining are very high in comparison to their value. So perhaps mining now (while the rewards are rich in # of BTC) and holding according to perceived future value is a viable investment strategy.

On a side note, is there the ability to tip for certain videos? I think this data could be useful for you to determine which videos are popular (amongst other metrics, but people opening their wallet for something would imply how enjoyable it may have been). Also as Bitcoin grows, could we possibly see economies of scale that allow content producers to give away their content but still make more than enough to support their operations?

Looks more like a slow melt down to me. Low volume on exchanges and price slowly moving down. There isn't enough buying to keep the price up (people aren't moving bitcoin on the markets, our main source of pricing bitcoin). Probably just short term noise until the next round of large buyers jump in, trading starts to happen on a larger scale.

Try wordpress or some other pre-made blogging site.


Most developers need to update their sites....


What browser are you using? Try using firefox with flash block, ad block, javascript block (all help with speed and security)


Sounds weird, malware a possibility?


Yep, consumer routers are known to be shit, the manufacturer develops a product and ships asap without any commitment to security or stability. I recommend looking at a different solution such as pfSense, Untangle, m0n0wall, routerOS. Projects based are a bit more concerned with providing a beneficial piece of network hardware.
For the browser crashes try another browser, Chrome and Firefox are the best to date.
Try an open source OS. Ubuntu Linux or Mint Linux are very good operating systems that provide a rock solid/safer environment for your computer. You can download an ISO, burn/copy to a CD/DVD, and run the operating system right off the disk to get a feel for how it works.


Computers don't have artificial intelligence yet. Within 10 years I would expect computers to start to understand when you talk to it, right now a computer is not smart enough to know the difference between New York, New York and New York, Kentucky (some history and context would be required...)


My mother, who is a grandma uses bitcoin, does this count? Not everyone will use bitcoin. Just like some people don't own mobile phones or browse reddit. The economic advantages of bitcoin don't need 100% adoption, it is only the people who don't accept are at a disadvantage.

This is a feature that businesses implement because changing pricing on 10,000 items every minute would be ridiculous. I wouldn't bee surprised if that changes in the near future (with technology). Producers and resellers would probably benefit from making x% profit on every widget made/sold. Perhaps some businesses will market their "stable price technology" that makes it easier for people to shop. Floating prices will allow markets to price resources more efficiently, it really depends on what you want.

A free market is the most efficient way to distribute scarce resources. Economics if the study of how this distribution of scarce resources happens.
Your ideals being well meaning are not rooted in reality. As of right now we don't have unlimited power sources, or even super efficient ones. We are coming to the point at which the basic necessities for humans can be provided with little effort, 3d built homes, food in abundance via advanced farming techniques (without oil though?), ubiquitous transportation thanks to computerized transport, an abundance of energy via new nuclear/solar/wind technologies. These will make the **basic** human life easy, but if you want to enjoy the scarcer resources, the nice property, the awesome vacations, the trip to Mars, then you will need to work and be more productive than the next guy.

Look at volume, Bitfinex which is one of the larger exchanges is averaging 5 million USD equivalent in trades a day, really slow for a 6+ billion dollar economy. Compare that to $5 trillion a day in the forex markets (fiat currency trading). There is plenty of room for manipulation. There are also secondary markets which are catering to the rich clients and they are most likely not doing business with traditional markets. The problem is that we are pricing bitcoin based on a small percentage of the actual market. Smaller investors and speculators are probably still gun shy about utilizing third party exchanges as risk is high from regulation, hacking/theft, programming error. HODL and get involved in the community (teach, build, advocate), I wouldn't be suprised to learn that the wealthy are slowly accumulating at relatively low prices.
