But why male models? 
@_date: 2017-05-03 21:32:28
So pissed that I somehow lost a full bitcoin.

Ok but If it's on the phone then it's on the phone right? Why do I need the paper. I think u threw it out kike an idiot. I assumed it was worthless after I swiped it.  
Edit :just tell me I still have a chance

I lost 1 bitcoin  using mycelium wallet. I swiped the paper wallet and it just diapered somehow. Now my phone is broke than I used but I'm certain the btc is not on it. I paid $890 Canadian for it and it's not worth over 4 grand. I'm so angry. I had it on a paper wallet but the paper was starting to fade. I should have laminated it. Does anyone know if I can recover the coin.

The wierd thing is I know the paper wallet was swiped but u did not see the btc show up anywhere in mycelium. I tried swiping again and it said balance was 0. I stupidly threw out the paper wallet. Could the key vr somewhere in the mycelsoftware?

Mycelium did not make it clear at all. The bitcoin was swiped and disapeared. I'm fairly tech savvy and this happened to me. Bitcoin is not as easy to use as you people claim. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:51:25
If I can get phone fixed. Is there a way to recover it from mycelium? I don't have the seed. Would there be a record of it somewhere?  Would there be a history of where the coins are sent?
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:48:26
Without the seed I'm screwed though right? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:07:01
What if I don't have the paper. When I tried to 'swipe it again it said value is zero. I think I got rid of the paper out of rage. I'm really upset about this 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:49:42
If I don't have the seed am I screwed? I didn't even see a seed to write down on mycelium. Fuck my life. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 07:03:34
I hope so. Only because I lost a coin because mycelium glitched on me. Said it was swiped and the disapeared.
@_date: 2017-06-09 09:02:49
I don't have the seed it the paper anymore. I have a broken phone.im fucked, I know. It's lost. I really thought it would be an easy process. There's probably no way to recover it. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 10:31:06
I  understand. I don'tike how this entire bitcoin movement has not made. It 100 percent clear thwt writing down the seed is essential. Look at all these posts saying how easy it is to buy bitcoin.
