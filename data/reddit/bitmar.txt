It is true that this game is old but the most important thing is that it allows play for bitcoins. I think it is a good example for games developers. Bitcoin may be useful in the gaming world. I'd like to play for bitcoins but not gambling. I just want to show it's possible :)

comment BFL_Josh from:  
"Those pictures are the pictures we based the purchase off of. We did not inquire as to the GPS coordinates of their origin and assume that the pictures represent the actual product. If they don't, well then, we will deal with that then."
It is convenient explanation. 
2 options:
1. Seller cheating BFL
2. BFL is cheating us
It's just a discussion.  Do not accuse anyone without strong evidence. Everyone deserves to be explained. Now they have time to fix it. We'll see....

True, naive is to buy something that does not exist. Why so many people can not wait for the BFL will have already finished product? Oh, I know... money... money... money.... Easy money makes us blind... Pirate knew it, so he is a rich  now

Yes, you will be kicked from the server automatically when you hit 0 BTC :) then you have to refill yours account again.

there is no business model. The game is losing money but it gives me a lot of fun :)  Fee is 5%, it seems a lot but covers only a small part cost of server maintenance.

Bot battles It's not a bad idea :)

Speed ​​hack is fast only in name. You get the same effect by clicking the button quickly. You can't click faster than the server will allow. I do not see a problem that everyone used the "Speed ​​hack". Grenades and grenade launchers are also available and resistant to cheating.

yes you're right. But these forms of cheating are easy to detect and modifying the server code can be prevented. Aimbots are the worst and you can not fight it. You can just let everyone play with this.
