*In theory.

About your third point. Assuming that you've been around a while or know your history (idk, maybe you can tell me,) has sidechains or the blockchain as a settlement layer always been the vision? Or was it a solution now that there has been scalability issues?
As for your last point, what gives Monero its legitimacy?
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:55:04
Hehe, good shit. I don't know about the "there could only be one proof of work chain" statement. In doctrine or theory. The world is a competitive place. Practically speaking though, don't you think that there will be blockchains both public and private? I mean maybe Bitcoin can serve all purposes but don't you think some businesses are going to want control and proprietorship over their systems? Call it a glorified database but maybe there will be use cases. 
You don't seem like the type to waiver but I must relay that things often don't work out 100% unadultered as planned. You cannot discount influence. 
As you mentioned though, the value proposition (I will have to look that up), doesn't care long term and a trustless system is unique. I am intetested how things will turn out in the short term though.
Oh, and last point, couldn't there be centralization in the hashpower or miners? Wasn't that an issue early on?
Oh, and your thoughts on Bitcoin cash? Leaders supposedly profitting off of a fork aside, isn't it just fine that they exist if they were at odds with a decision? If they truly believed in something why the animosity? There is a lot of drama in this crypto space.
Edit: I reread your part about "The whole point of PoW is to remove the element of trust. You do not need to ask someone what the true history is, you can outright verify the longest chain of work. PoS reintroduces trust, completely undermining the entire point of crypto currencies."
I had not considered this. I will assume that since the blockchain uses math that its validity can be verified at anytime. That is a very solid point. ETH's proof of stake may provide heavy incentive but it can never be as absolute as math. I hate to even continue after that realization but what about probability? If enough different people have enough funds in the system, could it not be somewhat trusted? But then again what if the balance of money and economy were to shift into the hands of the few, although if it shifted to that extreme something very tragic would have happened already.

Thanks for the history lesson. Don't want to ask any more questions so I'll go through your history and look for clues on what you think of Ethereum. When I learned about it, I bit full line and sinker. Now that I've did very minute amounts of reading and gathering input I'm not so sure. How can it overcome the security tradeoffs inherent in having complex opcodes and the scalability issues. Is the project too ambitious, which could cause security holes? Why are you not sold on PoS taking off? There is a calm sentiment around Bitcoin regardless tbough it seems. The developers/advocates appear unbothered about other coins "taking their shine". 
Ethereum seems like a good idea but there seems to be some discrepancy about their project. Vitalik is a determined guy and he does a good job explaining the Ethereum platform. There's use in that on a social/psychological level. People love a leader (Steve Jobs). Why don't Bitcoiners feel nervous that Ethereum could gain ground? I suppose there is room for multiple blockchains though.

"Top it off when its empty." Why bother? I can just use my visa card. For all the hub bub about Bitcoin not needing a middle man it's ironic that Bitcoin makes you the middle man (you have to transfer funds from your bank account into your wallet.)

Lol, good post. There could be some savings there compared to Bitcoin on chain transaction and LN node transaction fees. We'll have to see. I doubt too many first worlders care. The fact remains that fiat will always be a part of the equation so why all the steps again? If I get paid in Bitcoin then so be it but most "top up" and "prepaid" schemes are annoying.
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:24:48
Oh, well in that case it's no big deal. They have the funding to handle it. I thought there could be potential for the whole operation to be shut down or made invalid.

It's called a trustless system, fam.
Although, the suspicious "disappearance" and mystery sorrounding Satoshi Nakamoto bothers me. No telling if/when that wallet will be activated causing a serious crash.
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:58:43


Sounds a lot like the 2 to 15 hops between a payment's LN node routing. All taking a fraction of the cut along the way so again, what solution is being solved here? Especially from a first world perspective?
If you are talking about sending money across countries or continents however there is purpose there.

Do you think the SEC will take measures in some fashion, factoring in that ETH is based outside of America?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:46:26
Smh, get out.

Last question - what do you think about inflationary currency vs. deflationary currency? What gives people the incentive to spend? It seems like there will be a lot of volatility in the short term as people cash out and the only way for the coin to stabilize is high volume and frequent use.

Man, I love this comment. How much do you think this will matter in the real world, practically speaking? I mean people will bring it up as a point of politics but the average person wouldn't care. I suppose those who have precious and valuable belongings will, though. Still, the product(s) that get to the forefront first will have the most heavy momentum and staying/usability power.
Also, I liked his point about the Bitcoin bug. If code is law then maybe code can be flaw. Maybe people would have to eat that risk for investing in a vulnerable technology.

On-chain scaling is more inline with the original white paper but I'm not trying to get into it with you right now.

Came here to say this. Namely how will this get adopted when people will routinely game the system.

I have stock in a company that operates in Bitcoin. What does all of this jargon mean? Will Bitcoin related stocks rise or fall on Aug 1st and what about the price of the coin itself?
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:56:09


Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.
This is why Bitcoin Cash (if successful) is more in line with the real definition of Bitcoin.

I'm not sure what all of this means but I own a couple of shares of a Bitcoin related company. It was trading at 6-7 for weeks now it's up to 9. Should I sell it or wait till Aug 1st? What will happen to BTC related companies' shares on Aug 1st?
