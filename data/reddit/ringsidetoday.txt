I did this earlier and wasn't hit with any mining, transaction or any type of fee.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:02:52
Your GPUs belongs to me.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:19:18
You paid $123 to learn a valuable lesson, don't buy bitcoin with paypal and don't trust anyone on reddit to deliver you anything they promise.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:56:24
wrong subreddit. Go [here](
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:47:24
Register with coinbase, or an exchange that is allowed in your country.
buy said bitcoin
wait until its deposited into your coinbase account
sign up for gdax account.
login to gdax (partners with coinbase) and import your bitcoin there
then withdraw to your ledger nano s bitcoin wallet to avoid fees.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:25:36
lessons galore.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:29:10
Don't keep bitcoin on exchanges. Move them to a wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:57:56
No thanks, Hornet70.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:36:43
So if you lose the hardware wallet or it breaks, do you lose your coins?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:57:38
Ya college students are rolling around in extra money to buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:48:24
Checking hold on
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:57:18
Did you get an email confirmation or remember from whom you bought it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:42:23
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:32:01
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:44:32
Right so my question is how do those 12 words get your coin back when the hardware wallet isn't connected to the internet?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:41:35
You're fine, you can even send it to the old btc address or the new one it generated.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:06:34
Look up lightning
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:40:03
He's not my real dad!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:50:14
What does this mean?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:56:00
It's been a fun week.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:42:10
Wrong place r/gpumining 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:28:30
Sorry for your loss man.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:29
Yeah look up how to get a bitcoin wallet via youtube. A lot of people use exodus, jaxx, copay or even get a ledger.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:24:48
13NKDWnbcHLJzg9wqtJnYdH7ny35Ad3t6R paypal?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:30:13
Yeah. Internet here, awaiting coin.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:54:56
I think the network is congested right now and is backed up big time, thus why steam bailed on bitcoin.  Better to wait until things are back to normal to transfer the rest.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:20:11
No. Don't do it. About a million posts on reddit you can search for. It's a scam.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:51:19
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:23
Well said! Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:14
sorry whats happening on the 10th and 18th?
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:55:42
I'm sure it'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:24:45
Pardon my noob question. What happens if one day your ledger doesn't want to turn on...have you lost everything?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:01:21
Always a good time. When it's worth 1m each we are all going to kick ourselves for not having bought more.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:54:24
Buy Bulgaria's I hear they are selling
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:43:52
Sorry typo.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:49:49
[Serious] I think 1M, if it got to 100k, I'd look back and be like it's not really life changing with the amount I have. Life changing would mean somewhere between 500k to 1M. Do I think it's going to happen? No.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:29:02
Alright I can help, awaiting coin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:26:31
Square right? I have that too
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:55:53
You sound weak minded, why did you even buy in the first place
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:23:11
Refer to sidebar.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:18:01
Not enough,  PEACE
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:36
I think all that does is pull the info from the block chain ie your transaction history
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:19:48
at 30 eh? you must be single too
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:50:05
Welcome to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:06:51
Register an account on coin base and buy there. In a few days it'll show up in your account, send it to your wallet. If you're a visual person like me, use YouTube for step by step directions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:50
Mostly the ghosts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:09:33
Stay strong man!
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:52:50
Done. Even though bitcoin is backlogged and this payment is still unconfirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:41:47
Cloud mining is a scam. Stay away.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:26:07
It means you'll have to wait till Tuesday to see it in your coinbase.com account. Don't keep it there, not safe.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:39:32
Just hold, next week when we are at 20k you'll learn to not panic.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:56:44
thank you for that explanation!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:46:19
It's at the point where my blockfolio goes up and down a few thousand dollars every few minutes. I just need to accept I'm still up in the long run and not to panic
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:18
Same situation as me. I moved my litecoin and ethereum,  but not my bitcoin yet. I'm worried about the large fees.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:31:30
it IS visa.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:28:15
do a reddit search it was heavily talked about a few months back. basically due to mining always needing more hashpower due to the difficulty going up you'll never keep up with what you need. you'll end up paying more money to upgrade your hash power and you'll never see your ROI.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:37:55
I needed a laugh
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:16:10
I'd still use coinbase - even if they may be down throughout today. Whatever price you purchase it at today is the amount you get whenever the transfer happens.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:11:41
Has bitcoin gifts ever been brought up in court?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:52:18
It's going back up. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:05:05
Time to buy more?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:19:30
stop reminding me
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:36:15
What's it mean?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:43:40
Not legit.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:22:22
Still looks like $20-$25 fee if I want to send my BTC out of my Jaxx wallet to my cold storage.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:31:55
so am I stuck here paying this ridiculous fee? or can i add my private key to samori?
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:44:06
How many people have you pissed off because of this fake shit?
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:33:51
Atleast give me some credit, I said I am moving funds OUT of Jaxx, right? lol
