THE ONLY REASON BITCOIN GOT THIS HIGH WAS BECAUSE OF ALL THE TRASH TALK BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND TRUMP. UNLESS KIM JUNG PHYSICALLY DETONATES A NUCLEAR WEAPON ON GUAM OR JAPAN THEN THIS IS THE TOP FOLKS! NEWS NOT EVEN DISCUSSING IT ANYMORE AFTER THE SHIT STORM IN VIRGINIA! IT WAS ALL A BUNCH OF GRAND STANDING ANYWAY TO DIVERT ATTENTION FROM THE TRUMP / RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. SELL NOW AND BUY BACK MUCH LOWER! DON'T BE STUPID, NOTHING GOES STRAIGHT UP! IT WILL GO BACK DOWN TO THE $2,000'S (POSSIBLY EVEN $1800'S WITH PEOPLE OVERREACTING) AND WE WILL BOUNCE FROM THERE.

Most likely from Poland or Italy. Those scam artists are disgusting.
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:23:05
Listen folks, I used to hate Bitcoin Cash until I realized that realistically this is an amazing buying opportunity. If you can't beat em', join em'. It's clear that they're not going to stop until the price of BCH is either equal to or surpasses Bitcoin. Imagine if you could have bought Bitcoin for under $1,000 -- well that's the same way I'm looking at BCH right now.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:15:39
TIME TO SHORT!
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:51:47
Let me school you real quick.
Where there is an opportunity to make money...
there will be money.
You are correct to assert that there will be a significant plummet in price of BCH, however only initially.
Soon thereafter, mining pools will start popping up, people will start becoming curious about ways to make money with bitcoin cash, money will start pouring in from people who don't understand why bitcoin is $4,000 and why bitcoin cash is only $500.. these people collectively will raise the price of bitcoin cash, I predict, to become parallel with bitcoin's price! WATCH AND SEE! It may take a couple months but believe me it will get there.
The move to create bitcoin cash has absolutely ZERO to do with the betterment of humanity and all the BS they're preaching, it's all about cold hard cash. There will be people in the future who will pump BCH so high it's going to blow your mind. This will be good for longs because the higher one goes, the higher the other will go, they will literally be fighting each other to gain higher and higher market caps. Expect this to go on for several years. Then there will be a great bubble burst I predict when bitcoin reaches $10,000 and shoots down to $200 to $500 ... then the cycle will start all over again on the way to $50,000 per coin, ad nauseam.
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:06:21
NO WORRIES, BITCOIN GOING BACK DOWN NOW ANYWAY YOU DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING. NORTH KOREA TRUMP DEBACLE IS THE ONLY REASON IT SHOT UP. UNLESS KIM JUNG DETONATES A NUKE THEN THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. MEDIA NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT ANYMORE, THEY'RE FOCUSED ON THE SHIT SHOW AT VIRGINIA. WHOLE THING WAS ANOTHER TRUMP RUSSIA DIVERSION ANYWAY. YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET BACK IN UNDER $2,700 ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS LEVEL IS UNSUSTAINABLE. SMART MONEY ALREADY SOLD AND WILL BUY BACK MUCH LOWER.
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:52:59
You realize the roller coaster metaphor only has two states, right? Your picture depicts a member that is outside of the set, a straight line, that neither goes up nor down, therefore making it an invalid proposition.

Hi, I can't help that you forget to take your schizophrenia / bipolar medication. You should try and get an appointment set up with your psychiatrist as soon as possible.

To make it even worse, this was an international crime so add in a couple more years for that and Russia isn't exactly friendly with the USA. Use your brain people.

What's interesting about Stox is that they're doing the exact same thing as Unikrn ( Marc Cuban and Ashton Kutcher, read here (1)  (2)  (3)  ) except this approach through wealthy celebrities like Floyd guarantees their app to be first to market. If I was Floyd, I'd make them sign an exclusivity deal ASAP. I like that they're calling themselves a prediction app instead of a sports betting app lol, smart. With the kind of target audience Floyd has, this is going to be a smash hit. If I was Marc Cuban or Ashton Kutcher I would buy out Stox immediately. This is like a digital version of SHARK TANK! I wonder however, if Floyd is aware of BIP91, BIP148, BCC, etc. and has done an analysis of what effect it will have on the August 2nd offering (whoops let's not use that word). Floyd Mayweather is going to beat Connor McGregor on August 26th (Connor just doesn't stand a chance). Just had to put that in there.
By the way, here's what Unikrn has to say about the recent declarations on ICO's by the SEC:
Hello Unikrn Community,
As many of you know, the SEC came out with a strong position on certain ICOs and token sales yesterday.  
Our legal firm, Perkins Coie, just came out with their position. Along with them we have seen positions from Cooley, and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton. We can confirm, as we’ve always known, that some tokens are in fact securities, while others are real tokens of value, or currencies.  
Unikrn is confident that our token is not a security, it has never been a security, and will never be a security. We are also happy that the SEC came out with their position, they are absolutely doing the right thing. The cryptocurrency space needs regulation to protect consumers and the broader community.
I highly encourage you to read the position from Perkins Coie.
Thank you, and you can look forward to more updates on UnikoinGold and Unikrn. As always you may find us on Twitter and participate in our new Discord community.

(5) withdraw your bitcoin and bitcoin cash to private wallet afterwards
