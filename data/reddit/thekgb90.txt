I can't exactly speak for him but he is saying that since this increase is so long overdue, the time for a small stepping increase is past. With the exponential adoption of Bitcoin, a doubling of the block size to 2mb simply won't last. It took 7 years to realise 1mb blocks and how long do you think a 2mb block will last? What is the plan when this saturates? Does the Bitcoin community go through another hard fork? Every hard fork creates a chance to split the community and could lead to Bitcoin's failure. People argue that adoption is good and raises prices but what happens when we start emergency hard forking to not bottleneck capacity? Do you think the average person will want to use a product in an emergency state all the time? I personally think the miner opposition is a moot point because the mining pools can already manually set the block size they make on their end and what transactions to include and the minimum fees they will accept. Mining is competitive and those that refuse to be competitive will be driven out by profitability.

Almost 12.5k according to the person who looked up the case

The benefit to that is that it averaged your loss/gain. You would have gained more by only buying at the bottom but you could have also lost more if the price increased and you bought near the top. On average you still paid a little less than the normal price.

They are easy to setup. I had one running in less than 30 minutes for our student ACM. Having access to bitcoind makes queries easy. Payouts are handled directly so funds can't be stolen. It is also incredibly hard to ddos because there are thousands of nodes running. The only complaint with it is that asics don't work well with it but that may have changed by now. Anyone that is having trouble setting up their own node can PM me for help. I will clean up some of my scripts to be shareable.

Everything Bitcoin coin has been removed from Apple. Good thing a lot of people use Android like myself

I was about to ask what the hell is installed on my phone. Lol

The benefit to this is that no personal information gets sent upstream. The browser attempts to determine relevant ads to display. No more tracking

I guess it would depend on the processor. If your cpu was made in the last 8 years, it has a security measure to prevent buffer overflows and underflows. The obvious OS for this is Windows 8 because the app is Win 8 only. Knowing this and the fact that the folks at Microsoft are well aware of these kinds of attacks, it isn't a big jump to realize that there are preventions in to OS to stop this exact thing.
Now if you tried to get me to run an app that you made in Java, then that is a completely different story because Java programs run in a virtual machine that has been proven to be exploitable by all sorts of attacks. The major concern you should have is to stay away from anything written Java because that is the way the thieves will get a hold of your wallet and even botnet mine without you realizing it.

But how do you determine when the coins are really lost and not just in waiting? I have been giving a lot of thought on how to reintroduce them back into the market. So far I haven't come up with a sold answer that doesn't have potential to break everything.

Not that I know of. I have been running this app for about a week and have not had any issues. It doesn't run in the background and it is fairly easy to encrypt your wallet.dat in trucrypt for better protection. By doing that you will be protected even if this app manages to somehow break through.
This is from an article published in All Things Security:


Cyber criminals exploit buffer overflow problems. Malicious actors take advantage of this software vulnerability to alter the execution path of the application by overwriting parts of its memory. The malicious extra data may contain code designed to trigger specific actions – in effect sending new instructions to the attacked application that could result in unauthorized access to the system. Hacker techniques that exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability vary per architecture and operating system.
It’s a common mistake in application development today not to allocate large enough buffers or check for overflow problems. C/C++ applications are often targets of buffer overflow attacks. C/C++ applications have no built-in protection to buffer overflows. Developers of C/C++ applications should avoid standard library functions which are not bounds checked, such as gets, scanf and strcpy.

It is the processor. Fire up your mining program and go!

It could be a possibility but all of the apps are screened and approved by Microsoft. It doesn't have file access permissions. Only looks like internet permissions are given for the app

I make 1.75x that because on the 6950 I got in last week. I have another on the way too.

Mine Crashes too. I don't bother

3 weeks ago my 6870 (300 mh/s) was on bitcoin making .012 BTC/day. Not much but the power cost will be more worth while. Most likely cheaper than a 6870

6870 is doing litecoin as it is a little more profitable. I have to pay for this electricity I use. A cheap asic and I would let it run just to contribute to the network

Difficulty is less right now and the exchange rate lets me trade for more BTC than I could mine in a day. I mine like 2.5 LTC/day and the exchange rate at this moment is 0.0234 BTC/LTC.

I would think so. Can't say 100% yes as I'm not a mac person. It should be able to use a standard program like guiminer. Hardware is Hardware. Apple just likes to use different drivers for their stuff which brings the incompatibilities.
As for ports, it should not matter because the amount of data being transferred back and forth will be much less than 480Mb/s which is the bus limit of the USB 2.0 spec

It takes a more sophisticated program to breach memory allocations from the OS. I don't think this is possible in html and javascript(don't confuse with java and its exploits). To break out of its memory bounds would be a significant flaw in Windows 8. At that point why worry about bitcoins when you can access anything. 
tldr, I don't think it is possible

This is pretty much me once a month. At least mining them isn't too bad

P2Pool opens up a lot of flexibility if you run your own node. You can add whatever kind of access you want and build api's to display this information. you can also get friends to mine on it and charge a fee to maintain the node. One of the biggest reasons to mine on P2Pool is that your earned coins aren't held on someone else's server, they are immediately deposited into your account.

For litecoin I get 300 kh/s. Bitcoin is 300 mh/s
