Okay, let me redefine my question a little: given the rapid increases in the entry cost of mining, it seems plausible that most mining will be performed by a few wealthy parties, not a traditional network as described in the white paper. What are the possible consequences of mining being controlled by a few groups?

But the currency system we have now isn't completely centralized either. Sure, the dollar is completely controlled by the US government, but the world economy is balanced between many different currencies. These currencies aren't always on the same page. Just as an example, China fudges with the yen to give advantages to Chinese corporations. 
Bitcoin would be technically decentralized, but everyone would use the same ledger (assuming altcoins are marginalized). That seems pretty centralized to me. Could we end up with a scenario where instead of dollars, euros, rubles and yen all competing, their respective countries all run massive mining operations?
I could imagine China charging higher transaction fees for transactions to or from addresses with out-of-country IP's, to complete the currency manipulation analogy.

Other cryptocurrencies have solved those problems, with many more added features as well. A transaction in ether takes seconds to process, Dash is very fast, Monero and ZCash offer advanced encryption, etc...
Bitcoin *could* adopt many promising features, but as the original cryptocurrency it's staying fairly conservative. It's role right now is kinda as the reserve currency for the rest of the crypto world. 
The problems you mention are far from unsolveable
