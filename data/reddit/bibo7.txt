Honestly I missed these articles, they are hilarious.
Especially the end made me laugh: 
"The Guardian’s independent, investigative journalism takes a lot of time, money and hard work to produce. But we do it because we believe our perspective matters – because it might well be your perspective, too."
What a biased piece of ..., though written in a very good manner !

There is a few in the bitcoin kiez including Room77 (bar).
I wouldn't say it is the capital, Amsterdam and London crypto is more likely the capital.

Cryptonaut on Android and livecoinwatch.com if you're looking for a webpage. Totally happy with it.

Nice. What kind of ATM ?

I prefer Cryptonaut, it has a nicer UI.

"If we doesn't receive" -&gt; No comment.
Just drop by if you travel next time to the US, I like their service ! Finally it is possible to eat lunch in the financial district and pay with bitcoin. Awesome ! 
There will also be other events like "Bitcoin Happy Hour"...
You can't stop innovation !

There are many users with no problems, but unfortunately many (usually with more than 1 BTC) still wait to access their funds. This is just not acceptable ! (Also check:  )

I couldn't have written it better. Without decentralization there will be a dollar equivalent in digital form. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:04:33
I'm more than happy with Cryptonaut

I will start legal actions, I was hoping I could avoid these costs.

Useless Memes &amp; posts like that made me nearly leave r/bitcoin for good...
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:00:30
That's why the topic is bitcoin and/or gold. Precious metal prices changed in the last decade. Now Palladium is the most expensive.
1. Palladium
2. Gold
3. Platinum
4. Silver
I agree with you diversifying in hard assets is a good strategy.
@_date: 2019-04-27 17:57:46
I still love Cryptonaut :)

Which countries used silver as a reserve asset and were destroyed ?
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:13:00
He was a great moderator imo.
@_date: 2019-04-23 23:32:55
Silver reserves are estimated to be approximately 500 million ounces available above ground compared to around 2 billion ounces of gold. This alone makes silver something of an anomaly considering that gold is valued at around 50 times the price of silver.
@_date: 2019-04-24 01:34:40
ok let's say it different, silver reserves are more scarce than gold reserves.

It is not the most important if the government has plans in blockchain or not, there is basically no vision, high taxation, many regulations and unfortunately it gets worse after every election.

Cyptonaut -  
Great app - you can track all your coins with it and it is available in multiple languages.

Attitudes in Germany are hostile to innovation, except when it comes from government or MNCs. 
People seem to forget that "der Mittelstand" (small and medium-sized businesses) are the backbone of the German economy. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:56:51
I couldn't have said it better. I left Germany years ago, best decision of my life. Running a business is a bureaucratic nightmare in Germany, and many people find something "suspicious" about it. Bad spirit, no wonder as financial/technological literacy is very low compared to Anglo American countries.
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:34:09
Unfortunately very true.

When I tried to submit my claim I always received an error message, and thus couldn't claim it. Is there still any hope or too late ?

Better use Cryptonaut lol

Pretty cool ad, but why not keeping both ?
I really enjoyed this panel discussion at the Mallorca Blockchain Days: 
They are explaining why it is important to own real assets. 
Hard assets as bitcoin, commodities, land are king in a "fiat printing world". Keep HODLing...

Anybody had similar experiences with Expedia ? 
Now they replied to me : "We were unable to locate your reservation based on the information you provided. You have reached the customer desk of Expedia US and we can only retrieve reservations booked on "
You may need to verify the travel agency that you booked your reservation with."
Of course I booked with Expedia US, as they are the only ones that accept bitcoin payments, I also mailed Coinbase (they are handling bitcoin payments for Expedia), they immediately found all infomations, but Expedia still cannot handle it.
I am waiting more than a month for my refund and I find it very unfair, that I still haven't received anything. I'm starting to think they do this on purpose to damage the image of bitcoin :(
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:26:15
I am still waiting for a refund, from an Expedia booking :(
It is nearly one month ago that I cancelled a booking. I will never use any merchant that works together with Coinbase. This is a nightmare !
@_date: 2017-06-14 09:40:12
If it wouldn't be so sad I would think this is a prank. I got another reply from Expedia customer service:
"We suggest that you contact Bitcoin to assist you with your request" - Guys it is 2017, if you accept bitcoin payments please also train your staff!
@_date: 2019-05-24 23:18:59
Because most people don't understand what money is.
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:18:08
That's true...
It looks to me, they wait for the right bitcoin price to refund. Very strange.
@_date: 2017-06-13 10:26:01
Please be careful ! After serveral calls expedia still hasn't refunded me my payment (about $2,500). They promised to  fix this problem for me until I called them again and they said it is not their problem, but the one of Coinbase.
This means they are lying to theirs customers and you have to fight with other companies for your money. This is really terrible and will be the last time I use them, I am grateful for any other alternatives.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:16:49
I am still waiting for a refund :(
They just keep me in the line, now it is nearly one month and still no solution in sight :(
I will never use a merchant that works together with Coinbase (Expedia).
