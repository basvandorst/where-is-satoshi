Ha, these Argentinians and Venezuelans are missing out. Get over there on Paxful! I've made more there in less time than I ever did with lbc.

Also, I've been on Paxful for around 6 months. Users tell me it'll be good to get updates from Reddit. so here I am. What's your story?

Actually they still are. Just being more selective about it

I wonder when they'll (finally) have an office in Africa? It really is the next step after the incubator hub, 2 schools, and all those vendors.

Uhm, it's because these people are using their account to get out of the fees which is really "cheating" right? Thats not how the site is intended to be used. This is why they have all these features so you dont have to trade outside of it.

What's your angle here, I've been seeing you comment "sell me BTC" on bisq in almost every other user. This post just turned from interesting to sketchy
