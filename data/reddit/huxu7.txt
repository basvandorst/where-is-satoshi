There are lots of great companies to give 1 BTC to on this thread, but I would like to propose that 1 BTC to any of them would not be as impactful as 1 BTC to an individual in need.
I would like to propose my cause.  Many people would do a lot of things with 1 BTC at its current price, buy a car, get a bunch of neat toys, but for me 1 BTC could buy me a few years of my life back.  I am currently in $12k of CC debt which has me working 2 jobs and donating plasma in order to pay for and provide for my family.  We have stopped using CC all together for about 2 years now and have started using Simple to manage our cash flow.  I have worked out a plan that if I work these 2 jobs and donate plasma that I will have 2 - 3 years left to pay off this debt completely.
If you sent me 1 BTC, my CC debt would be gone forever and you would have gifted me 2 - 3 years of my life back, life that I could spend with my family instead of away from them.
I am willing to provide proof of who I am and my situation to show you I am no troll, even show that the 1 BTC went directly to the CC debt to save me those years of my life.
It would be the Christmas gift that gives for years to come.
If I am not the cause you are looking for, thank you for at least taking the time to read my need.

I think it's weird you want a refund, the Humble Bundle is about supporting a cause more than just buying a product. It's like you give to a cancer charity in exchange for a discounted t shirt and then you go back to that cancer charity and ask for a refund cuz you don't like the cheap shirt.

To double spend you have to own 51% of the hash rate, also you would have to time it just right as you are solving the block to make the transaction and then reverse it and solve the block you reversed the transaction in.  Small transactions I imagine you could be fine with 0 confirmations, but large ones I figure they will wait around to make sure the transaction happens.
If you own 51% of the hash rate, your goal will be large transactions because let's be honest you are making a ton of money anyways so you would have to be targeting a very large transaction.

Wow! I think I kinda like this! You get some Bitcoin at whatever price, then you can lock it for whatever price so it doesn't bounce around.  So basically you would lock it at high prices and unlock it at low.

What are the chances that someone actually generated such a vanity address though?  It takes forever just to get an address that has 9 characters the way you want them.  And the address its self says its a throw away address.

Here's the deal, BTC is now being used in a VERY big way!  Huge companies are taking it on as a form of payment, this pretty much guarantees that BTC will be worth a lot of money later on.  How?  In approx 4 years the block reward will be cut in half, this naturally makes BTC more valuable as it's more scarce and by then more companies will be accepting BTC so the demand will be even higher.  Then another 4 years, it's built in deflation and it's acceptance are what gives it huge amounts of value years from now.  Today, this week, this month, is not what matters.

Now that more places are accepting BTC its harder to not spend it, when we spend it with these merchants, 99% of the time turn it straight into cash.  So if the customer doesn't buy back the equivalent in BTC, then its the same as money leaving BTC.
Where should we expect this to go?  Those that have made a killing off of BTC gains (e.g. bought $12 BTC and now its worth $580) they are looking to buy themselves some TV's, computers, or whatever with cash they don't normally have so they won't be buying back the BTC they spend because they wouldn't have otherwise bought those things if they didn't have the BTC to.
This will happen from time to time.  When merchants can pay bills, salaries, taxes, etc. in BTC then the cash won't be leaving the system and the value will stabilize and/or increase as the demand for BTC goes up and the demand for cash goes down.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:27:50
I think we all need to take a moment and reflect on the age old question that anyone new to Bitcoin would ask... "What can I buy with Bitcoin?".  The answer to that question started out very minimal and mostly appealed to the tech saavy (as highlighted in this video:  but with Overstock accepting Bitcoin, the question is "What CAN'T you buy with Bitcoin?"

Once quantum computers come out and reusing an address becomes a huge security issue, this policy will get more difficult to keep track of who is the owner of what addresses.
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:58:11
I would also like to note how it talks about deflation and how no body would spend their money, Bitcoin has proved that theory wrong!!!
@_date: 2014-10-21 17:50:06
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:43:19
I just recently did research on this and found that quantum computing could derive the private key from a public key that has been exposed through a transaction.  But if that address has been emptied out on that transaction then the quantum computer didn't get anything helpful.
So the only thing it threatens are addresses that are used more than once, because once the public key is exposed the quantum computer could find the associated private key using Shor's Algorithm and Grover's Algorithm.  But if everyone generates a new key for each transaction and empties out the address when they make a new transaction then there is no problem, but right now it's VERY customary to use the same address for pooled mining and other things so we would need to develop a different method.
@_date: 2014-07-25 14:56:37
Being programmer and having a computer repair background, I wouldn't trust GeekSquad to do anything.  Most of the time they are going to do what will get them the most money, which means spend as little time as possible on a machine, collect money and move on.  They will probably say they couldn't recover anything but you will still have to pay for the service.
Most people I know who have taken their computers to GeekSquad have had their computers wiped and have to start from scratch when they took it in for a virus issue.
If there is no other option, then make sure they back up what said.
Also no matter WHAT happens, make sure you get that bad hard drive back, if they can't recover the file then you want to keep the hard drive so you can take it somewhere else to get recovered.
When you do get it recovered I HIGHLY suggest you move everything to a new address as you never know if the people who had the drive copied your private keys and could empty the addresses at any time, beat them to it.

This sounds great and all but my hashing power is already barely enough to make sense and your pool hasn't solved a single block.  If you can get some of the big miners over to your pool then the little guys will follow.
@_date: 2014-06-24 15:20:04
From a protocol standpoint you cannot reverse the transaction, but from a merchant standpoint they can send you the bitcoin in a new transaction for the same amount.
Think of it like this, if you paid cash for something at a store and went back to get a refund, they aren't going to give you the EXACT dollars you paid with, they will give you whatever ones are on top of the cash drawer.  Not the same exact BTC's but can be the same amount.

That is assuming that he bought the BTC in April, but judging by the transaction I would assume he owned [19Gt9VKmmyMpMHEv6dkf8ddwmwddoSoJ8w]( which dates back to Aug. of 2012 and its also possible that he owned addresses that fed into that address as well which date back even further so its definitely a possibility that April wasn't when he got his first BTC.

If you are an Android user, you are actually using a Google product.  Direct downloads are dangerous, especially with Bitcoin because you could be putting your Bitcoin into a wallet that's a fake and that Bitcoin will be sweeped moments after you transfer funds to it.

I kind of feel like this is a "duh" conclusion. It basically says "we have discovered that if people post one of their BTC addresses somewhere public we can figure out who owns that address! How that works is mysterious!"

The pool isn't going to report your actual hash rate, your miners will tell you that.  The pool will make guesses at your hash rate depending on how many shares your miners submit and how quickly.

Yea, so buying that you will never make your money back.  I have a 7 GH/s one and I am making $25 every 3 months and not too long ago it was $25 a month, so it's slowly but surely becoming ineffective.  10 GH/s you could probably have $30 after 3 months and over time it just keeps taking longer and longer to get that $30 so you will never make back the $300 you spent on it.
TL;DR from here on out it's more cost effective to buy a BTC today then spend it on mining hardware.

Those app Ad's you see in the Facebook app, Facebook charges $3 to the advertising company if there is a confirmed download from one of those links, even if its a free app and the user doesn't spend any money.  The idea is they are getting people to download the app and try it.  Its advertising money, money that can or cannot lead to more money, its never guaranteed.
So Circle isn't looking to get their $5 back on every account, they hope to get more users to hopefully get more than $5 back from various accounts in the long run.

High jacking this comment to say: There has been an increase of people saying the promo code is now invalid... it was fun while it lasted :D
Edit: maybe it still working for others?  If you see this comment before you try to claim it, try to claim it and it might still work.
Edit2: It was off but just turned [it back on for us!](
FINAL EDIT: had extended it for only a short amount of time, the giveaway is [now over...]( but you can still try because some people are still able to claim it, I'm sure it takes a few min for the promo to disable across all of their servers.
EXTRA FINAL EDIT: They have started the promo back up again until 5 PM ET!!!!!!!!! BUT they are currently down because of "maintenance" (aka Reddit hugged them) but once they come back they will resume the promo for 2 hrs!

Maybe try again in a little while? The promotion stopped working but they just re-enabled it, might take a few min to become active across all their servers or something like that.

You can set your fee, you don't HAVE to pay that.

After Butterfly Labs I have a hard time jumping on board with Bitcoin miners.  I would need a 100% money back guaranteed if returned for any reason within like a 30 - 60 day period, so I can fully test that its going to work for me and provide the output I am wanting.

This is something I am starting to find myself thinking.  People wanting to mine buy expensive machines and end up making a ROI in $ but they don't make their ROI in BTC and that sucks because BTC is more valuable than $.  My wife will ask me how much $ we are making mining and I will just respond in BTC and not say what it is in $ because $ is worthless, it's the BTC amount that matters.

Nope, I'm pretty sure that's the smell of burning eyeball flesh.

Why not Coinbase?

Ah yes, its just closer for me to get to one of their stores in OK, even though I live in TX.

Yea you have made more than $749 but you haven't made more than 4.15 BTC which depending on when you bought the contract is how much BTC you could have bought with $749.  If your contract stays consistent with the .15 BTC payouts then I guess it should be another 16 weeks to get your REAL ROI of 4.15 BTC.

Those other currencies were for games and services as more of redemption points, so how ever much money you put into the game or service is what you were able to redeem only in that game/service. They were useless everywhere else. Bitcoin can be used anywhere and the number of attainable BTC is limited.

Nobody has ever made money mining.  By that I mean you won't get as much BTC as you would if you spent the money buying the BTC.  We are talking ROI, sure the value of a BTC will go up but so will difficulty so if you bought BTC today you would have more BTC than your miner will probably ever mine in its life time.  So you may make your money back in USD but not make your money back in BTC.  
For example, if you bought one of the first ASIC miners from BFL, the 4.5 GH/s miner when it first went on pre order, you spent the equivalent of 25 BTC on it and when you got it in April this year it's only made you maybe 11 BTC.  Same story for all the miners this year, better off buying the BTC because by the time you get the miner it won't get you your BTC back.

The Coinbase app for iOS still works even though it's not in the App Store.

Right they believe that Bitcoin is failing and they are going to lose their fiat that they put into it, but what sucks for them is they give up their Bitcoin for that.  The Bitcoin is far more valuable than any other currency and technology to ever exist!  So even though we have seen these cleansings happen, the fiat value of the Bitcoin recovers and continues to go up because there is ALWAYS a large group of Bitcoin owners who continue to buy it no matter what the fiat value of it is.  So people who think they are losing fiat because of a cleanse, if they pull their fiat money out, they are losing twice.

Here is were you can see their current shipping status: 
As of today the 5 GH/s machines ordered on May 9th of this year are going out.

In the end BTC value is going up, whether it bubbles and crashes, it goes back up.  Always and forever.  I love you.

Save this post and revisit in a year and people will be jealous that you could buy in at such a low price

I think mining should be looked at from the same perspective as buying BTC.  You may not be "printing" money that pays off immediately but you are investing in the little amount of BTC you may mine ending up being worth more later on down the road.  Too many people look at the immediate pay off when it comes to mining when it should really be looked at as future pay off.  You might be able to mine 0.1 BTC and spend $60 to do it, which at current rates means you got $43 after spending $60.  But a couple months from now that 0.1 BTC may be worth $100.
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:19:08
Very cool!  If I had been one of the early adopters or been able to buy a lot of BTC before this year I would totally be doing the same thing as you!  Keep it up!
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:31:58
Blockchain is actually hard to read when trying to find information.  Anyone know of a tool that exists for starting with one address and tracing their bitcoins back to the miner who created them or the parts of them they have received?

Does this help?

This company has the BEST beef jerky I have ever had: 
They would do well with bitcoin because people would get addicted to their jerky and buy more and more bitcoin to buy the jerky with.
I have already sent them an email about accepting bitcoin, trying to keep it basic and to the point of that it will boost their business (I even sent them a few success articles) but I haven't heard a response from them, don't know how often they check their email.
@_date: 2013-09-19 16:21:23
Their jerky is the BEST I have ever had, and it is actually addicting so if they do accept it, plan on buying a lot of BTC to keep buying it!
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:20:05
If you could spare, send me 1 or 2 would be nice :) I will return the favor in the future
