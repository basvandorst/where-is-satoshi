only if he cashes it out to USD. if he keeps it in bitcoin, no worries.
he will be subject to capital gains tax which is difference of price between price on purchase [date of donation?] and price on sale - a capital gains allowance each year. his fears are unfounded as in this [hypothetical] case it will be a 'massive' loss and therefore there wont be any tax.

sorry i'm still newbie [but a programmer]: what is a proprietary wallet? you mean like a wallet on coinbase or blockchain.info? in that case, i have my own wallet. i generated the 12 word seed with libbitcoin-explorer. i printed to paper and stored it and have also memorised it. and i have also checked whether i can recover the private key with libbitcoin-explorer from the seed words. looks good. i have also rendered the private key to qr code. havent printed it verbatim though.
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:29:16
the power consumption could be reduced if the method/scheme/algorithm that confirms a block of transactions were improved. but how this can be done since the method/scheme/algorithm gets progressively difficult and you have use brute force to find the answer? eg., a bunch of zeros in first n bits?

thanks for reply.  libbitcoin-explorer is open source project in C++:  i built it from source code on a gnu/linux machine ie its local software on my machine, not online. if the code disappears [off the internet] or my hardware fails [and i cant access another computer at all], im in trouble! better to also print the private key verbatim!

why should i run out of the shop to double spend? this is stupid. hah u realised that too, a bit late for my liking though ;) even if they confiscate my smartdevice as soon as i make a payment, i could still be having say a server that sits outside this shop ;) ie somewhere in the clouds, that checks for payment going out of my wallet address and initiates a double spending immediately. this is why 10-minute confirm is too long for on-chain trivia transactions and the seller has to ask you to be accountable ie at least be at the shop, ideally lock you up or ask you to mortgage something of equal value...crazy, thats why its impractical using btc for trivial transactions today. 1 confirm at  least is essential.

@_date: 2018-06-26 22:09:13
thank  you.  like in open source software, if the fork proves to be better, people move to it over time, or the fork gets merged with the mainline etc.  this makes me think that 21 million isnt some set in stone ie a technical limit, like say a 64-bit number can have only 64-bits, its a limit due to current consensus which is a social agreement. so when someone comes and says 21 million is all its EVER going to be, i thought id raise the flag, but i'm asking to get more ideas.

on localbitcoins, choose a trader with good reputation, once u initiate a trade u will be invited to send GBP equivalent to btc u are buying to a bank account number, the trader will give u the account number, sort code and their name.  u setup a new payee from ur internet banking usually under section pay a family member or friend, dont mention bitcoin in the reference when you pay this person. my bank wud then ask me to enter a pin using its app and its go\[ne\]. the bank wud threaten that there is no way to refund the money because u are paying some random person. if the account number is wrong u are in trouble too so double check the numbers u enter on the payment screen.  but after hitting the pay button, screenshot the confirm screen and message the trader and mark that you have paid. trader confirms and releases the btc. transfer it to your wallet immediately. buy small amounts say 50 quid worth of btc. get practice and also ur reputation goes up bcos u are trading more.
@_date: 2016-11-16 12:43:00
yes they are ready to pay the bearer of these old notes the equivalent [any amount before end of 2016 :]
what does unfit mean? the note is torn/soiled? a govt can deem a currency unfit when it wants to.
of course, bitcoin is much safer but remember its also based on consensus that has a remote possibility of being disregarded [eg., if the cryptography can be broken]

i'm also not sure about entering into a contract and pre-load it with bitcoin. can i cancel the contract instantly and my funds refunded? or should i wait for the counterparty to agree to it?
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:54:32
yes, those smaller pieces can be divided into even more smaller pieces infinitely. eg., how many real numbers can you fit between 0 and 1? infinite. so u could have milli satoshi, micro satoshi, nano satoshi and so on, u just have to increase the bit width of the number holding this 21 million limit to divide it into finer and finer slices. so i think 21 million bitcoins is a limit set in digital stone :)

yes, but the unit could shift to 1 meter instead of 1 kilometer and that creates 1000 more units of land to sell/rent than before.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:27:05
why not? the kilometer is an arbitrary measure, a meter is an equally arbitrary measure with the knolwedge that its related to the kilometer. the measure that succeeds is the one that is more convenient to use. 
the speed of light is constant yes, but we dont measure the speed of say a plane in terms of light speed, in fact we measure it proportional to speed of sound.

what see? which part of it is confusing for you? 'happens to be', and 'not the total supply'.
the MoneyRange function is used to validate transactions. if u read that code u see it tests nValue &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; nValue &lt;= MAX_MONEY *NOT* nValue &gt;= COIN &amp;&amp; nValue &lt;= MAX_MONEY. that means it allows for units of money lower than 1 satoshi. in fact all the way down to 0. go figure.

steve wozniak is a mathematician?
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:52:25
the idea is 21 million *whole* bitcoins can be mined. the smallest fraction of a whole bitcoin is currently 1 satoshi.  this limit is determined by the bit-width of the number used to store a bitcoin. expand that bit-width and that smallest fraction goes down.  it could still be called satoshi or renamed to something else.  this smallest fraction is the actual unit of exchange in the bitcoin world. therefore 21 million bitcoins is not the limit as everyone thinks. in fact it can expand indefinitely - by expanding in the *opposite* direction!
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:06:37
so what does anyone worth 10 million USD do now to guard themselves from these in-person visits? what do uber millionaires like sports/movie stars, ceos do? couldnt u just kidnap their kid for a ransom? very tempting in this case bcos the victim will pay with his bitcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:11:31
you are taking those pills :)
when you *can* sell smaller and smaller pieces of land, the value of the smallest piece you can sell determines the value of the larger piece made of these small pieces, not the other way around.
just like the price of 10 bitcoin in USD is price of 1 bitcoin in USD multiplied by 10.
u seem to be attached to the number 1. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:51:03
kidnap and ransom is a credible threat faced by all celebs. i think all of their wealth is insured against kidnap. they probably pay a very high premium every year for that.
maybe there is market for bitcoin insurance :)

satoshi is the unit. 1 COIN is 100 million satoshis.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:31:54
you are missing the point. gold is physical and it has to obey physical constraints. but bitcoin is digital. its quite possible to increase the bit width of the number used to store the upper limit of bitcoin and divide it into ever finer amounts as i said milli satoshi, micro satoshi, nano satoshi, pico satoshi. one can even agree to call 1 sooshi = 1 nano satoshi and everything above is related to sooshis and trade in sooshis.  whether that happens or not is not the point, but that 21 million limit is not the unbreakable limit like speed of light or something like that. its digital, the only lower limit in digital is 1 bit.
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:26:48
as if they know what is good from what isnt. and as if history repeats itself.
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:57:14
the following is the code from bitcoin core master. the value of COIN is set to 100000000 ie 1E+8 ie COIN *is* satoshi. note MAX_MONEY is 21 million multiplied by COIN ie 2.1E+15 ie 2.1 quadrillion thats all cool.  but whats to stop from COIN to be set to another value? for example, to 1E+11 ie 1000 x 1E+8? the data type int64_t used to store COIN supports 64 bits. the number of possible numbers that can be stored is 2^63 - 1 = 9223372036854775807 ~= 9.2E+18 (and thats the number of signed numbers that can be represented, you get double that amount if you will store unsigned numbers!  note in the code the comment says satoshis can be negative so we leave it as it is).  so it can hold this new COIN value multiplied by 21 million comfortably because thats only 2.1E+17 which is &lt; than 9.2E+18. and 1 satoshi = 1E+8, our new unit 1 milli satoshi = 1E+11. 1000 milli satoshis is 1 satoshi, u could decree milli satoshi to be the base unit and call it some other name, maybe jagbot ;) so 1000 jagbot is now 1 satoshi.  and trade in multiples of jagbots, and forget satoshi in time such that 1 BTC = 1E+8 satoshis = 1E+11 jagbots, yet there is still only 21 million BTC.  it would need a hard fork but my point is the *effective* upper limit is not set in stone ie it isnt limited by the data type ie int64_t ie 64 bits used to store that value ie its an agreement among people.

@_date: 2017-07-03 17:56:00
its not about political motivation. this is not a loophole.  for example here in India, businesses that bring in USD/EURO/GBP are welcomed [eg., software companies]. so just convert BTC to USD and bring it in? and give option for the customer to choose to pay in BTC or USD. makes economic sense? the business can still stay like this on government's side.
i'm not sure ur %s are the stats :)
@_date: 2017-07-03 17:57:59
wikileaks actually moved to bitcoin when the govt regulated. hasnt killed them off.
@_date: 2017-07-03 18:10:16
if a coalition of major govts want to bring it down then maybe its time to go protesting on the streets...or shut up of course which many may or may not do.
what will the use-cases be?

the bitcoin energy consumption is like that story where the king offers to pay his courtier double the number of grains in the previous square of a chessboard. this quickly reaches a super large number even though the courtier starts with 1 grain on the bottom left square and keeps doubling as he goes along the squares of the chess board...
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:56:30
throwing numbers makes it sound scientific and rational.

business operates its accounts in a country that welcomes bitcoin and convert to currencies that the bitcoin regulating country welcomes?

the OP probably thought bitcoindependence could be thought of like drug depdendence. or maybe OP isnt as cool as us in coming up with portmanteaus :)

software developers may soon be held in as much contempt as the traders &amp; bankers were in 2008. ironically, bitcoin was created in 2008!

hope its not sleeping with someone at an exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:33:05
made me wonder can bitcoin scale to the current economy of 21 trillion if it becomes say the only universal currency? imagine the transaction times &amp; fees. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:43:24
