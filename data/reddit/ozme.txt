You mentioned that the Ubuntu systems were overly vanilla with respect to logging -- what kind of recommendations would you have for upgrading stock Ubuntu for enhanced logging for incidents like this? Also you mention pushing the log files (auth.log, etc) offsite -- but on what frequency and with what kind of trigger mechanism? Thanks for the diligent work with this, hope that ShapeShift can be online again soon.

"Here’s the funny part: we invented Bitcoin ATM 1.0 and it was not very good. The user experience relied on third party exchanges and wallets, making it inconsistent and unstable. Customers sometimes had to wait hours to receive purchased bitcoins. Bitcoin sells often failed altogether. If customers excluded miners fees operators were forced to choose between processing high-risk or slow transactions for customers. While some transactions got delayed, paper wallets were often lost. The ATMs weren’t smart – they didn’t remember customers. And still copycats emerged! The market exploded with SHI-TMs."

You don't have to run a full node per say, but you will need to have a server with SSH access running linux. You could probably do it for $5 or so per month on a VPS.
If you edit the bitcoin.conf file, set these values:
then start bitcoind:
bitcoind --daemon
This will give you access to the wallet system / commands for generating new deposit addresses on the fly, without connecting to the network, processing blockchain data, generating traffic/cpu load.

What I would do in this instance is, run Bitcoind with listen=0 in the configuration file, that way you can run the wallet system but not have to interact with the network and download the blockchain.
You can then write a PHP script to query your wallet instance using the JSON-RPC API. The flow would be:
1. Customer opts to buy MP3
2. Query a php file that connects to your wallet and requests a new address ("getnewaddress") over the JSON-RPC API. This PHP file could also output the raw base64 img data of the address in QR code format and a corresponding bitcoin amount due and a hash/token representing the transaction. Store relevant data in database. Ideally add some form of access limits to the file so IPs can't just DDoS you by requesting infinite wallet addresses.
3. Javascript then updates the check out page to show the address, QR code, and amount due.
4. Javascript timer to query a blockchain API, I like Chain.com:
5. Once transaction is detected on the network, javascript -&gt; thank you! page, and initiate the download.
Re: protecting the download, I would use the transaction token generated in step 2 as a "one-time" access pass. Store it locally in the browser with javascript.
When the transaction is detected in the code from step 4, call the download from another .php file, passing it the one-time access code, deposit address, and amount for the transaction. If the code isn't marked as used, and the amount / transaction double checks, output the mp3 to the browser and mark the code used. Otherwise, invalid.
One problem with this approach is that the coins are effectively "locked" in your wallet without the blockchain. So if you ever wanted to move/combine/sweep the funds you'd either have to resync with the network, dump all the private keys one by one (&amp; import into say, Blockchain.info wallet), or move the wallet file to a system with blockchain access.

Nope, just need Bitcoind and yes you will need to sync the blockchain if you want to be able to send funds natively. 
Download 
Without being synced, you can still use bitcoind to generate new wallet addresses (for example, to accept payment at). 
You could then check for incoming transactions using chain.com unconfirmed transaction API.

Not wrong. I can show you screenshots of two very conflicting amounts. The amount quoted and supposedly added to my account from the purchase when I clicked "Add Funds", and the actual amount credited to my account after I confirmed the deposit.
The difference was about 1%.

You can't import wallet.dat into Electrum, they are different schematics. You're correct though, if you end up missing some coins, as long as you hold onto the original wallet.dat file you can always resync it with QT and transfer any stragglers out.

@_date: 2014-10-22 07:32:55
I recommend using Electrum. In terms of sweeping your old wallet, it depends on if your coins are allocated among many different addresses, or a single address. 
You could use the console tool's dumpprivkey command to get the private keys for addresses with coins in them, and then import them into  to sweep to a new wallet.
It's probably safest to just let QT sync with the network, so you don't miss and or lose any coins.

You start your wallet staking from the point in the blockchain where you still had those coins. 
Because there is "nothing at stake" -- ie, it doesn't cost you much of anything to start generating POS blocks -- it is trivial to dump all your coins on the exchange, and then start staking with the starting point being the block before you sent your coins to the exchange.
Basically, if an exchange wallet ever, in the history of the coin, held a majority of the coins, the coin should be considered DOA.

This is an interesting read, the argument is basically:
Bitcoin the technology for everyone vs. Bitcoin the luxury good
Both Gavin and Pierre admit that their primary concern is driving the "real price of Bitcoin" -- Gavin believes including everyone would be best for the longterm price whereas Pierre maintains we should not be selling a Ferrari for $10.
Pierre proposes an experiment to help determine the appropriate fee/block size:
-Hold blocks at 1 megabyte
-Allow a free market for fees to develop
-When the acceleration of the growth of total network fees turns negative, users are beginning to substitute out of Bitcoin in favor of cheaper methods, so we increase the block size limit
Gavin argues that most wallet software doesn't appropriately handle transactions that never confirm, and so the danger is Grandma's $2.50 cappuccino will be lost in limbo forever and she'll have to see a "Coinbase Genie" to restore the balance.

Price stability will come when weak, speculative hands are margin called out of the game, when early adopters dump and redistribute their coins to more hands, and when miners don't have to rely on selling the entire block subsidy to pay their bills. 
If we continue to grow and hit the block size limit, a free market for fees develops. Moving Bitcoin will become more expensive -- a privilege, not a right, which will also necessarily increases the scarcity factor.

I don't like the idea of giving $2 for depositing 0.1 -- why should we trust you?
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:59:02
Bitcoin is not good for micropayments right now, and the network is being spammed heavily by the Sarutobi app, which is contributing to the delay of low value transactions.
However, there is no reason that website should require 10 confirmations on a $2 deposit.
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:47:56
Don't mind the angst. Sometimes people forget there is another human being on the other side of the keyboard. 
Take it from me-- don't bother with mining. It isn't profitable unless your electricity is basically free at this point. On top of that, an 1100 gh/s rig (about $350 right now) produces around $1.20 per day worth of Bitcoin. This also comes with noise &amp; heat pollution. These miners are LOUD.
If you want coins, just buy coins. It will save you a lot of headaches, heartache, and potential fire damage.

The limit isn't arbitrary, just like the 21 million hard cap... there is direct relationship between block size and decentralization. At 20 megabytes per block, the blockchain could grow a maximum of 2.88 gigabytes per day, or 1.05 terabytes per year. At that rate, you, I, and everyone not capable of expensive hardware and datacenter access would quickly be unable to run full nodes.

The difference being of course, **anyone** can still buy Bitcoin, the golden, decentralized ledger, they just won't be able to send 10 cents on the chain.

Not necessarily the "super-rich" but it should remain the golden, **decentralized ledger**.

~~Uphold is a joke~~ BitReserve was a joke.

Thank you for the response, really appreciate it. To be sure, I do run a full node, I just upgraded to 0.13.1 from 0.12.0 and I wanted to make sure that I was saving the proper wallet information (ie MPK) from the new HD setup, in the event of disaster. But it's problematic because Core can't actually import the MPK and it seems not to be cross-compatible as you state above, so maybe I will err on the side of not using the HD wallet until the import function for the MPK is built out-- what do you think current best practice is?

So, I generated a bunch of addresses and it seems that, given the master private key from the bitcoin-cli dumpwallet command, the derivation path does not work with Electrum; ie, Electrum is generating addresses that bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey does not know, and bitcoin-cli getnewaddress is returning addresses that ismine() returns false for... very strange
@_date: 2016-10-08 05:39:18
It hasn't disappeared into the ether at all. The easiest thing to do is, if you have the private key to the inputs (addresses) that you spent from, go to:
Load up your private key, and create a new raw transaction spending the same funds to the same destination address, and simply increase the miner's fee.
Then, take the output of the raw transaction and goto:
Then take the final signed transaction and broadcast it to the network!

Nope, you just have to sync the entire blockchain before it will appear (that's the nature of a full node). If you want, you can always goto the console and type:
dumpprivkey {THE ADDRESS YOU SENT THE COINS TO}

Yes, you can use the offline paper back up Root Chain to restore the wallet on ANY armory client. The wallet is "deterministic" and that Root Chain creates the same pool of addresses of your original wallet. Note that you still need to use the wallet program to generate all the addresses you used, but that is as simple as opening up the wallet and repeatedly clicking "Receive Bitcoins" until all your old addresses have been re-generated from the Root Chain.

No, except that it takes time and invalidates deterministic wallets. So basically if you create a vanity address and import into electrum or armory, you can't rely on using the electrum seed or armory root chain to recreate all your wallet addresses. It's not that big of a deal, but worth noting.

An unencrypted digital backup is your current wallet minus your encryption password you added. If someone gets ahold of this copy, there is nothing preventing them from spending your coin.
Your wallet is already encrypted, so exporting it as an encrypted digital backup is literally just a simple copy/paste of the wallet files that are already in your Armory directory.

Wow... withdrawing to an address which is connected to his software service? If this is for real, the guy sounds like a complete low-life. 2.3 bitcoin is a lot of money, especially for a 17 year old. Did you download his SMS alert software? Could be the culprit.
If you had enough time, you could probably sue him in small claims court if you could get his full name / address to serve him with. Not sure how far you'd get being able to prove he took the money, but it would probably make the news, and he might just settle to avoid going to court.
He is using Mt.Gox to process payments for his software, you might want to reach out to them and see if they can offer any information.
I think it's safe to say, do not download his software. Luckily we just launched our own free web-based price alerts service on  if you are looking for real-time notifications.

what exactly am I looking at here?

You don't need to copy/re-save after each transaction, only when you generate new addresses. 
I am not entirely sure how many addresses Multibit keeps in memory, but if you wanted to alleviate this potential issue, just go ahead and generate 100-500 addresses in your current wallet before backing it up, and transact with those. You won't need to make a new backup for a long long time.
Edit* for optimal security I would spread your backups around, at least two separate flash drives in two separate places if possible. Flash drives have been known to occasionally degrade / get corrupted while sitting on the shelf. Also, by definition you will need the wallet file on your computer in order to issue transactions with Multibit, but it's not such a big deal as long as you encrypt it with a good solid password you won't forget.

You could place an order on Coinbase. They won't ACH debit your account for 3-5 business days.

I never understood why people installed "Toolbars" ... they have never resulted in anything good ever happening, to anyone.

I like that idea! Thanks for the suggestion.

6 confirmations for a service like this is overkill in my opinion anyways. I agree with your sentiment, they are actively updating their twitter page, so it looks really shady to be avoiding your withdrawal / support request.

good question.. I would like to see this answered.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:03:29
Are we sure this is real? There are a number of grammatical and minor errors which leads me to believe this is fake. Or no one proofreads anymore.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:37:05
This is a point worth taking to heart. $6 billion is literally nothing, in the world we live in. Many individuals have more than $6 billion in personal wealth.

Does Coinbase really not have a money transmitter license (at the least in California?).
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:18:33
This saddened me greatly. I don't have much, but hopefully this can brighten your holiday season if only a little. I would advise against partaking in any acts of violence -- remember that all of these "things" around us, are just that, and none of it ultimately matters, in the place where we are all inevitably headed. Be rich in love, friendship, and empathy.

Thank you!

Congrats on the new hires. One thing I have noticed lately is that Coinbase is having extreme difficulties sending bitcoins to external wallets. Two out of the last 4 outbound transactions I have initiated ended up in purgatory, only to be returned to my account 24 hours later. Any word on what's causing this, and if there is a plan to fix these withdrawal delays?
Thanks and keep up the great work.

Nope, in fact each coin can be divided into 100 million parts (out to 8 decimal places). The unit of value is still the same, and benefits (or detriments) from price action.

That is impressive work. I've seen some pretty botched augmentations where the girls had a valley wide as the Rio Grande!

Nice to see this work out after all! Thanks for the gold.
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:11:24
This is an interesting idea but when you try to "tie" a derivative instrument to anything else, it's only as good as long as the conversion is honored. Unless you are incredibly prescient, or have deep pockets, you too like Nixon may have to close your "gold" window at some point.
Also, for your cryptocoin to exist people need to be actively mining it. You could rent servers from Amazon to do this, but it won't be free. And if you gain traction there will always be the chance of a rogue player trying a 51% on you.

Yup, should be ok as long as you didn't actually overwrite the space on the MicroSD with new files.

You probably got cookied by someone who sent you to a coinbase.com/?r=theirID link. It's actually the best case scenario for a first time user, you and the referrer just got $5 in free bitcoins.

Click Help --&gt; Debug Window --&gt; Console Tab and type:
walletpassphrase &lt;your_encryption_pass_word_if_you_have_one&gt; 60
dumpprivkey &lt;the_public_key_you_want_the_private_of&gt;
This will unlock your wallet (if it's encrypted) for 60 seconds, and then dump the private key for the address you requested.

You would need to store the private key on the card, which would be very risky and unwise.

Do you have a custom Adblock Plus configuration? I can't replicate with stock. Thank you for pointing that out.

I agree. The 0% fee structure was a nice deal to up their trading volume, and it will be interesting to see what their daily turnover is with the fee in place.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:39:23
This is all theoretical of course but I think if you tanked the market with a 65,000 sell at market order, you would disrupt the market just as much, if not more, trying to buy them back.

Nice to see a fellow silverbug here. The most important question to answer is, where will you store your Bitcoins? Personally I recommend the Electrum wallet.

If he is your friend and trust worthy, you can always send the transaction again and if you double send it have him refund one of the transactions. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:29:09
Never. It should realistically appear immediately. The only thing that can interfere is if somehow you lost / had spotty internet connectivity, or the Multibit server you were using to broadcast was unreliable. This is one of the benefits of running your own full node.

Bitcoin is a protocol. Generally, the only bad experiences I have had with Bitcoin have been when I've tried to make more some more BTC off my position. If you stick with your wallet and stay strong, you'll be fine... though the temptation for investments and 3rd party services is great, it's best to resist.

It wasn't immediately apparent to me, where to click, to listen to his tracks. The MixCloud banner blended right in and looked part of the template as opposed to a way to stream his music, so I clicked the SoundCloud link first.
Also, the footer link to the developer's site is broken.

BitcoinQT doesn't work like that. You can't specify which wallet.dat to load, it always loads the wallet.dat file in the application's data directory.
See here for appropriate locations to place the wallet file:

Let's step back a moment and consider the total market cap at this very moment in time. Just over 12 billion US Dollars. Do you have any idea how small that is? It sounds big perhaps to an individual, but it's not even 3% of the size of one Major consumer electronics company (Apple). Do you know how many trillions and trillions of dollars/euros/yen/yuan/pounds/etc ad nauseam are out there?
Even at current prices, Bitcoin is like the pin of a needle as viewed from Space compared to the piles (or should I say, hard drives) of currency 1.0 that currently occupies this space rock.

It will be an interesting moment indeed. I'm one of the devs behind  where you can check these ratios in realtime. I remember when Bitcoin hit parity with silver in March of this year and sentiment from colleagues was basically "Bubble bubble bubble, how can something that doesn't exist be worth an ounce of silver?" 
Well now we know...
Bitcoin:Gold = 1.625 
Bitcoin:Silver = 0.025

Things are a lot different than in April, in terms of structural stability and decentralization of the exchanges. People tend to forget but, Mt.Gox (the only real gig in town at the time) went offline for nearly a whole day due to being DDos'd to oblivion on that fateful day in April, which precipitated the price crashing.

You're correct. Just don't forget your password -- that's really the benefit of saving the seed (for instance writing it down on a piece of paper and sticking it in the bank) -- you can always regenerate all of your wallet addresses if you ever forget your encryption password or your computer / wallet storage facilities fail.
