Right, with Gold you can do less! You cant buy online or at a store using it. RIGHT?
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:31:56
I think people will need some time after getting into Bitcoin to realize that the best thing is never to cash out. I agree that all people who bought Bitcoin should never cash out. Only if you want to buy something sell the amaount of the money you need to pay!  
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:42:39
The deep will be about $3000
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:39:14
If you really understood Bitcoin you whould be scared!!!
@_date: 2017-08-14 14:36:37
Dont forget, Bitcoin is a new form of P2P electronis cash system and not an investment for a short period of time.
Bitcoin is the best currency in the History of human as it becomes more valuable over time (even better than Gold due to mathematics/exact limits) and is decentralized, not manipulated like the stock market and central banks!!! So why would anybody want to cash out and turn it to fiat? The only reason whould be to buy some staff...
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:29:39
Yeah its true, the correction will be not so big like 2013...just back to $2800 from $4190:)
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:50:03
ITs LOST forever, like holding foerever without spending it. LIKE a donation to everybody else!!!!
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:21:53
So the paperwallets on Bitaddress.org can be used for both chains/coins? Can i use the same address to send BTC and laso BCH using a different client? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:27:59
Its like 2013 November... A correction will come...when it comes? Nobody knows. Why it comes? Because it went up to much in short period of time.
Bubbles like this will happen again and again!!! Get prepared, and dont cry if it drops/crashes hard....its normal for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:37:21
Yes, if you loose your Bitcoin its LOST forever (so there are less in circulation). NOBODY can recover it! Nobody says that Bitcoin will work after 1000 years... If it works for the next 140 years till the 21 milion coin is mined, it is a succes!
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:05:46
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:52:44
yes as more the price increase the more interesting people become in Bitcoin (without understanding/knowing) how it really works and how powerfull it is and will become! The future is very bright!
Just HODL, Bitcoin will take time to get adopted from people...but it gets more and more :)

@_date: 2017-09-09 09:26:56
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:27:53
Bitcoin is your NEW kind of Cash/Gold which you should only spend if needed. Dont speculate dont trade if you cant!!! Its a form of Cash which value increases over time !!! you got it?
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:21:37
I would say 4200USD
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:20:33
consolidation has already happen...now we will go higher!
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:24:57
Nope, it was something called Bitcoin ..... i dot remember the second name...it is lited also in bitcointalk early this year i think
@_date: 2017-09-24 12:48:19
Fork doesnt matter!!! The price will go up to $10,000 in the next months!
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:30:56

@_date: 2017-09-09 12:36:02

BUY NOW
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:44:01
Dont worry its value will increase over time more and more...and people will say the same thing as you now in the future!!! If Bitcoin dies, it will be after you, dont worry!
@_date: 2017-10-01 09:33:45
everything is fine as it is right now! 
If the whole Bitcoin community was together it whould be  CENTRALIZED without the power of Dimogracy and Decentralization. Dont forget the power of Bitcoin is its Decentralization (not only how Blockchain works but everything about Bitcoin)
Its normal what happens, as Bitcoin becomes bigger and bigger its community will become mor divided and we will have more Hard Forks in the future. Thats how Bitcoin has to work to life forever!!!
EVERYTHING IS fine as long as the code works fine! :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:30:14
Invest and handle it like Cash! Never sell everything, just spend what you need!
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:57:45
Its NOT too late. Its never too late..as the fees maters if your ATM's will be used not how much are in your area.
@_date: 2017-09-30 13:22:48
Lagarde is talking about mass adoption on 2040! Hidden messages guys. Listen carefully, she dont talk directly about Bitcoin but she is talking about a decentral virtual currency and how it will look like! :)
BITCOIN mass adoption is coming.. as planned years ago from BIG Bankers as they saw their central system will fail in some time (as you saw on 2008 Bank Crisis)
Have you ever asked yourself why Bitcoin was released after the Banking crisis on 2008? Do you think it happened accidentally?
Think about it!

20 million coins out of 21 million Bitcoins will be mined in about  8 years..after that about 115 years are needed to mine the rest of 1 Million coins
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:27:24
...the best is that most people dont even know that Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million coins and that every 4 years there is a halving..... :))
@_date: 2017-09-17 19:07:09
..72 blocks
@_date: 2017-10-01 07:39:13
For spend we need something which is unlimited! SO you keep always your waelth in Bitcoin and change it to the other currency if you want to spend!
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:26:06
MORE good times are coming for people like you who understtood the "basics" of Bitcoin. I wish you all the BEST!
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:06:37
I saw this too and i wandered also why it went up...than i checked blockchain.info and  and both show the same adjustment/difficulty.
I dont know why the green line is not at the same level as the difficulty adjustment.. ithink the estimate on bitcoinwisdom is wrong. check  for the next estimation its UP and on bitcoinwisdom its Down
