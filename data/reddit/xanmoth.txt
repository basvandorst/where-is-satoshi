Don't transfer directly out of Coinbase.  Send it to you GDAX account first for free and then transfer it from GDAX to Binance also with no fee (well, they pay the fee).  Everyone with a Coinbase account has a GDAX account automatically.  GDAX is Coinbase's trading platform.

Deposit USD to coinbase.com from your bank account = 0 fees
Transfer USD from coinbase.com to pro.coinbase.com, you 
automatically have an account = 0 fees
Buy BTC using a limit order = 0 fees ( I think, been a while.  Tonight I did $300 using a market order and paid 0.75USD because I was in a rush)
Withdraw BTC to your wallet = 0 fees
For a wallet I agree with , Trezor.  For small amounts I have Samourai and Eclair on my phone which have been great.  Being able to set the transaction fees is important in a wallet.  Don't use the bitcoin,com wallet if you're a BTC fan as it is created and marketed by the organizations around BCH which is a different blockchain.

Quick share:  I was at a client site (IT) who does financial services talking to an advisor .  The Kavenough thing brings up politics which shifts to monetary policies.  We have an interesting conversation about the Fed, banks and the gold standard.  He agrees that it is an apparatus to keep the rich rich and the rest of us poor, hidden actors, Nixon, fractional-reserves, etc. 
Mention Bitcoin, his response "Fuck bitcoin.  Is it down?"
"Well yes since last year about 60% but overall ---"
Get cut off, "Good!" and he goes back in his office.
Confused I went and did some more work but had to go back to find out.
"Do you like or dislike Bitcoin?"
"I hate it.  People treat it like a get rich quick scheme.  I have a client that put in $10k in December against my advice.  I'm a conservative investor."
Ah ha, ok can't argue with that.  What's interesting to me is that this guy is fully aware that the dollar is a non-backed currency controlled by a private company and enforced by the US military but is still selling it as his job.  Seeing what we are up against in person was sobering.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:28

@_date: 2017-12-23 03:10:29
I did exactly this a few hours ago.
Coinbase -&gt; GDAX was instant, I mean click and by the time I clicked OK it's listed in GDAX.
GDAX -&gt; Gemini started a few seconds later and took about 20 minutes and it's confirmed.  As far as I can tell GDAX/Coinbase paid the transaction fee.  Seems odd but it just happened.

In low income areas with a population that can't get a bank account, Bitcoin ATMs are the path of least resistance to people wanting to speculate.  ATMs are also a way to "bank" for a largely cash-transacted economy.  They are willing to pay the high fees for this service (7-10+%) while the banked user pays 1% to buy on an exchange or just gets a checking account.  In those poorer neighborhoods that might be considered exploitative.  I'm guessing if I ever use one it will be for a quick conversion to local currency while traveling which I would also expect to pay a fee for.

The basic idea as I understand it is that when it's not profitable miners shut down their equipment, so the hash rate goes down and then the complexity responds by dropping so the remaining miners are profitable again, which brings the old miners back.  It's all based on competition.
The cost of electricity is something I hope I'm right about. 
 Over the past two years I've watched my younger cousins and their friends getting career-type jobs in solar.  I don't see that going away.  Another somewhat good example is Washington state -  There is a ton of issues around how the locals are going to deal with this radical shift in electricity use.  I'd guess that they will keep cashing the checks from miners and if they raise the rates too high, well the miners will move on to the next big wind farm for example.
Also in eastern China where there are hydroelectric plants that produce more electricity than the locals need.  But it's too costly to transport that energy across great distances, so throw together some mining farms on location and all that extra power can be put to use.  Again, utilities and government are trying to work out exactly how to either profit from or shut down such operations.




The hash rate has been going up pretty steadily so yes and no.  Yes temporarily, no in the long term.

Nice.  A fork is when they take the blockchain your Bitcoin was registered on, copy it, and create a new blockchain with different rules and miners but it still has your wallet account on it.  So you get both.  The idea is to sweep the private keys from that original wallet in to a new wallet that supports the forked coin.  Then you have both.

The argument against is that everything Litecoin (as a specific example) can do Bitcoin can eventually do or is already doing.  Coke can't absorb Sprite's lemony flavor, doesn't make sense but Bitcoin can absorb all the good things being tested on altcoins.  It's the same for the gold comparison.  Nothing quite fits as a "It's like digital blah".  It's not like anything, ever.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:58:11
It's a payment tool.  It takes three days to send an ACH transfer.  Bitcoin is a lot faster and does the same thing for large amounts of money.  For small transactions it's what you said, a second layer like Lightning and Liquid.  We just need some killer apps to make it less complicated.
I also had a bit of an interesting realization at the liquer store tonight related to this.  I go there on weekends and the guy knows me.  I always use Samsung Pay on my phone which he remembers so as soon as the machine says approved he says thanks.  I'm supposed to stand there while it prints the receipt and then sign it and then wait for my receipt.  What's to say we just see the Bitcoin transaction appear which take seconds like my Visa and he says thanks.
It's just an interesting use-case for an on-chain  transaction in the real world.  I also have a funded Eclair wallet on the same phone with a lightning channel open that is what I'd really like to use in that situation.  But like you said, too complicated at the moment.
