Not regulation, more of a crack down like we’re seeing in South Korea.

Damn a lot of you are but hurt for me asking that lol

Agreed. But I’d love to see the bitcoin community to make more consumer demands to drive fees and prices down across the board to attract more people to crypto.

I don’t know. A little bit ago I sent bitcoin to binance from coin base and it took my money but the transaction never went through.

I had a fee of $35 for a $100 transfer :/

You didn’t do anything wrong most likely. The bitcoin community is at fault here for not making consumer demands.

I disagree with him. He doesn’t understand that ripple isn’t currency it’s a company, if he’s talking about xrp he’s still wrong because xrp isn’t a currency either. It’s value doesn’t come from the network all agreeing that a certain crypto holds value, but rather it’s value comes from ripples need of xrp to transfer money for major financial institutions.

What’s a good wallet for iPhone? I don’t wanna use my PC because it has a lot of viruses and is old.

I feel like my bitcoin isn’t safe on coinbase because I don’t actually possess the keys, so where should I transfer it to? Also how do I avoid the high transfers fees on coinbase when I move my bitcoin to a more secure place.

What is mempool?

$100 is a lot of money... 
Most people’s crypto portfolio fluctuates by 100’s or 1000’s of dollars and your really worried about a $15 fee?

Are transactions fees high from a wallet to wallet transfer like they are in exchanges?

That’s like saying “why do you care about super high fees? You can’t mine, once you start mining then maybe you can complain about fees”. It’s important to raise questions on price in bitcoin because a lot of bitcoin holders don’t know much about this technology which can very easily lead to corporations taking advantage of ignorance to suck every last buck out of the bitcoin consumer.
