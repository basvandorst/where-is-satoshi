Also Moto G is a really nice phone for budget.  
150$ for a quadcore with a very, very nice screen.

I feel left out.
@_date: 2014-01-30 11:18:14
makes me look poor!

That actually doesn't sound anti-virusy at all..
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:29:47

Not visiting the US any time soon

What is the combination of the safes?

Life lessons.  
I lost 400€ as a poor broke student, but I kept my head up.  
I just think about this: Well thats like.. 2 months of car insurence, if I had a car! So I am saving money! Yay!  
If you ever come to Holland ill buy you a beer mate!

But for those single street lanes with 2 bikes lines ONTOP of it.  
Car coming?  Better GTFO.

They still need to file these when they pay text etc.  
Otherwise they can just say: Yeah we totally received 1000$ from X.

Can I buy some of that auction?  
European FYI.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:11:32
Yeah and now it went down by 200€ and I didn't have enough cash set up with my broker.  
So now we're in the -100€ :D  
But I am making it back already..  
This is even weirder :D

The cat still ate 70 cents.  
It's the same as saying you scrapped your car worth 100.000$.  
No, that's the classic price, not the price it was when it was an old piece of junk.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:43:45
I bought some today, then they went down even further and then suddenly up.  
I made 100$ doing.. nothing.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:03:15
I still have 5 left, it goes up to +10$ and then down the drain every minute.  
It's fun, and ridicilous at the same time!
