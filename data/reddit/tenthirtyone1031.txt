No, my point is that the transaction with the lock time could be invalid by the time it is possible to mine it.
E.g. if my lock time is a block one month from now there is no feature in lock time to prevent me from creating a separate transaction that uses the same inputs as the locked transaction. 
For Andreas proposal to work you must trust that the person giving you a locked transaction has destroyed the accompanying private keys. 
I don't know what your entire post is about but your last sentence is just a repeat of what I said.

I suppose my prerogative is that if the Bitcoin Foundation has enough time to dedicate part of their day to fielding AMAs from us it's a bit of a slap in the face when some folks have been beating down their doors to try and get answers for a long time and been ignored.
When they raised their startup money they made promises. I cannot recall the original pledge verbatim because of time. This is where the transparency line of questions originates from.
TBF has millions in assets from the community.
In any job/contract/agreement I've ever been part of when someone gives you a lot of money you answer their questions when they ask. Especially when they are asking you how you are spending that money. 
We want to see how funds are being spent because we want to make sure TBF is actually upholding their commitment. Instead of saying "We want to spread adoption" Tell us what you are doing to spread adoption and let us decide if they are doing a good job.
We don't get that. We get ignored. 
So the big questions that revolve around the millions of dollars they have (and the $150,000 a month bleed they have admitted to) are us trying to make sure our investment is made good.
All I've seen are lobbyists. Other than Gavin's paycheck TBF has wasted all of our money hiring lobbyists. What the lobbyists are doing - we don't know. We aren't told specifics, just "we're working on blah" but no baselines or metrics to use to judge progress. 
From an investors perspective we are bleeding $150,000 a month to provide free rent for the majority of people accepting paychecks from TBF. 
Likely, that money could be spent much better by anyone else.

Yeah, I wish we had a democracy.
I'd like to get nine of my friends together so we could stand on the corner and take a vote to charge everyone passing by $50. If they don't pay we will arrest them for violating the social contract - it's innately implied that by walking on our sidewalk they agree to abide by our votes. If they don't like our social contract they should use another sidewalk.
If they don't pay we would kidnap... err arrest them and put them in one of our jails (basements) and then we could send other agents to their home to seize assets to pay the fee and cost of housing them in the jail. 
Of course, this would mean another vote to change the amount we charge the next person to use our sidewalk.
This can all be appealed if someone thinks we are unjust. That's why we will establish our own courts and write our own laws so everyone can learn them before using our sidewalk. If we get popular enough we might let some of those folks vote for our leader, but really it won't matter.

My questions stand on their own face. 
Coming down from your Ivory Tower for a second isn't that scary.
The transparency that is called for in every TBF thread - including many others in this very thread.
* We want to know the projects. 
* We want to know the goals. 
* We want them clearly defined with actionable items so we know what TBF is doing. 
* We want to know how much is being spent, how much is being donated, where the coins are going. 
* We want accountability. "Board Member: Other" is not acceptable for meeting minutes.
I can't take you or what you do seriously until the organization that you wrap around yourself makes good on the promises it made when it took money from the community to bootstrap itself.
Every single page of the Bitcoin Foundation website lists airy and meaningless BS. 


This say absolutely nothing. 
There is no leadership or direction from your organization. It has identified no metrics with which to measure it's performance or it has chosen to keep them secret. 
**We want a roadmap and we want updates and measurable gains. We want to know what action is being taken and why. A Foundation that represents a global community doesn't get to steer according the the interests of a cherry picked inner circle.**
If judged by your actions alone the Bitcoin Foundation is just a lobbyist organization maneuvering itself to the best position it can political for its own benefit. 
The point of permissionless innovation is not having to waste time and resources on Washington. That's literally all the Bitcoin Foundation has done. For me, that's evidence enough that the Bitcoin Foudnation is a farce that runs counter to everything Bitcoin stands for and it should be dismantled before further waste affects our already lean infrastructure.

I'm citing [these]( meeting minutes. 
At the bottom of page 7 Jon states:

to let everybody know.  Then like I said, we published the annual IRS form 
990 which is an overview of our assets, an overview of our income and 
expensive and compensation f
or key employees.  It’s a 33 page document 
and it’s fun bedtime reading.  Let me go over some of the highlights for 
you on the budget and expenditures.  We have a current monthly burn 
rate of about US$ 150,000 per month.
 


current.  It was about 50% of that as late as December of last year.  
Translating again into $1.8 million per year.  **We have $4.6 million 
equivalent in assets.  We keep 90% of our assets in bitcoin.**  We target 
the 90% area and because of that, it fluctuates up and down quite a bit.  
Inadvertently, we sometimes luck out on things but then the exact
So where did the $4.6M bitcoins go? I was wrong on the high. It was $7M when the price was $1,200. That's at the top of the next page.


What are the initiatives? With what Jon said in the meeting minutes the initiatives that started since December **doubled** the monthly spend. Justify the spend. I'm not comfortable with a man in charge of an organization who says "I don't have a problem with any amount of spend..." when the sustainability is likely being funneled in from a $4.6M bitcoin parachute that will eventually run out - but not before providing a few years worth of paychecks. 
There's no bang for the buck. 


What definition are you using?


Because you've yet to prove you can do either. Maybe reign in the ambition and produce some measurable gains first? Maybe remember your roots and honor the community that made the organization possible. 
All this is just lip service to the peasants so the foundation can serve its private backers. It's placating and insulting.

Patrick, First Q:
In "The Next Chapter" you state:


as the mission of the Bitcoin Foundation. 
You then outline three points
*  Communication with the community
*  Establishing a business model
*  Continued lobbying. Well, "ongoing dialog"
In the interest of honoring  Communication, how is a business model for the foundation and continuing the dialog in Washington laser-focus with respect to the mission of the Foundation? 
Are these three steps considered general house cleaning moving forward? I can understand communication and a business plan shoring up the management issues but how does lobbying help the software?
Last Q: **I think a proof of reserve audit to show that the bitcoins raised by foundation are accounted for should be a requirement moving forward before anyone in this community can take the foundation seriously.** TBF should be the open, model of a transparent Bitcoin organization. It should be the example to follow. That's not what it is today.
My interpretation of Gavin's original proposal is that TBF was to be Stewards of Bitcoin. This would help that reputation.
If Jon Matonis's numbers are correct in [these]( meeting minutes there are **5800 bitcoins** sitting in the Foundations wallet somewhere. There is also a $150,000 loss each month just to keep the lights on.
Will there be a proof of reserve audit and what are the reasons for the $150,000 loss each month? How can any of us be expected to donate to an organization that cannot prove it can keep itself afloat?

@_date: 2014-10-14 20:24:17
Educate yourself.
The Foundation operates at a $150,000 loss each month, has approximately $3-$4M in bitcoin if they kept their promise and held 90% in reserves. They have 3+ years to do whatever they want. It's our money. 
It's OK. You can say "I honestly have no idea what I am talking about but chose to lash out at you because I have no skin in this game and the Bitcoin Foundation is a really nice name with a pretty website so I took their side"

I posted below but I'm posting up here since you are the top post.
The problem with your analogy is that a bow can only fire arrows. The block chain can do many more things than record transactions and move balances around. 
The block chain can absolutely be used for things outside of currency. IBM's proposal is to use the block chain to store state data of smart devices. E.g. your smart light bulb records it's status in the block chain when it turns on/off. Smarter devices would also send energy usage information, analytics data basically.
IBM wants to sell you management systems. Their software would read the states written to the block chain and do things like:
Has an alert set to notify you on screens that are in use when your laundry finishes. 
Analyze your energy usage and throttle devices it believes are not in use. 
The possibilities are truly endless for the block chain. 
Of course, this means that IBM will likely have their own, private, mining farm they lease out, like all of their equipment. They will probably use their own proprietary algorithm or keep it secret. You can pay them to secure your block chain while leasing the management software. It's a total solution and fits their current business model.
If you think the only use for the block chain is Bitcoin or currency you have a vastly underused imagination and shortsightedness where innovation applies.

If I had espoused undying love for the Bitcoin Foundation that makes them better questions?

It's my personal belief that the Foundation couldn't serve the community if it wanted to right now. I can't offer any reason why other than poor management. 
These aren't hard questions. After operating for two years if you can't speak to the value you've created or at least share a baseline or some kpi it's just a tid arrogant to call someone a troll when they ask you to give back the funds you were supposed to use. 
Effectively they are holding 5800 bitcoins hostage that could be put to work shoring up Bitcoin.

Where does this madness come from?
1 Billion people vs 1 million is not even worth entertaining. Even in astronomy, a couple powers of ten among friends is no big deal because it equates to such a small % of the actual answer.
We're literally talking about the difference between .00014% of the population vs 14% of the population participating. Sliding around the decimal doesn't make it any less effort. E.g. 


Is moot. Whether it's one person or 1 billion person the net effect must be equivalent to 1 billion people spending $.01 of effort mining a day. 
The fundamental problem is that there is a much higher return on buying large, chip-packed miners. Now, you duplicate all of the logistics for each miner for every individual person. 
What I mean is this: For $2,500 I can buy one 4.5TH miner
For $2,500 you couldn't even ship to a respectable number of people any size miner that would matter. 
I feel like the spirit of your message is "The more people involved the better" which is just not true. The economics cannot be ignored. There is no way to satisfy the logistics of what you are proposing.
These people would mine in a pool or it would be even more pointless for them. Regardless, the majority of these people could be brushed aside by one person - or mining pool - adding a few more large boxes to their shop.

If people start saving they won't spend any money on food or clothing or things they need! Without inflation the people will gain value on their savings. No one will start businesses because all human want will disappear. We'll all just sit and watch our bitcoins gain value.
The ever increasing value of a bitcoin would do nothing to entice those who don't have bitcoins to innovate or create to obtain them. Noooooooo.

What Occupy were you part of? The one in my city was a band of disrespectful, smelly, dirty, squatters who destroyed an entire park that took years to repair. 
There was not a lot of depth to the Occupy Movement.


**This is where every one of us should turn around right now and ignore this person**
Only tyrants think your participation is required for them to have the world they think is perfect. They always have an emotional reason you should be involved so you won't make rational decisions.
Think of how dumb the average person is. You want to stand next to them during their revolution? 


Too bad your opinion won't be the one that decides whether or not participation in cryptocurrency is resistance.


They never will. They are unable to appreciate capitalism and can never understand the power Bitcoin brings to the table for the ordinary person. 
The Occupy Movement would receive Bitcoin thusly:
1.) It is not fair because people already mined it before they knew about it
2.) They cannot mine because equipment is expensive and therefore "capitalism" (I know it's not a point but they don't)
3.) They'll be so distracted by alt coins that promise them utopias when they lose all their money because they are too dumb to figure out monetary policy it will leave them with a sour taste towards all cryptocurrency
Again, these aren't deep people we are dealing with. There isn't a lot of thought going through the minds of someone who takes over someone else's property and makes demands of the world.
In fact, that was the most satisfying part of that movement for me. Seeing my generation literally go out in to the streets crying out that the world owed them something just for breathing. And the world didn't care about them and these people being absent from the economy proved they have no impact on anyone outside themselves.
Instead of taking that as a call to service to go out and become valuable to the world they retreated to their parents homes and have become perpetual teenagers.

Prove it. 
I mean, let's just assume that somehow we get 1GH USB sized ASIC miners to 1 million people.
Reality would probably require you to cloud mine and slice up the GH because devices this small/price won't be around for a while. But I'm using:  for my metric. So for magic-sake, everyone can get 1GH for $.50.
One person would mine ~0.00008735 BTC a week. This would add 1,000,000 GH to the network. 
Right now the network is at ~300,000,000 GH. It would cost $500,000 with this magic ASIC device that I made up just for this example and only add .3% to the network hash rate. 
EDIT: It wouldn't do anything to centralized mining and Bitcoin doesn't have centralized mining.

Not true. It's your narrow view.


In what application? You haven't even stated a purpose - just that it is not possible. Yet you are ready to say there are no benefits and it costs more. What would? How are you deploying it.


Block chains are just data structures...
It's not crazy pseudo science or some strange miracle. It's just a giant guessing game to maintain a file. 
Want your mind blown? 
People don't want to store their medical records in a global, decentralized medical record that's maintained by unknown shadow people on the Internet.
A private block chain shared between hospitals. Set Hash rates = 1/N. Your medical records are tied to you instead of your hospital. It doesn't matter where you are they are accessible 24/7 at a moment. 
Block chains just solved every major problem with electronic medical records. 
That's 1. There are millions more ways to implement a block chain that is centralized and achieve astounding benefits from an enterprise perspective.
My turn - What enterprise architecture do you have to lean against in your peevish and childish regurgitation of other people's talking points about block chains?

Mining facilities pay network engineers, maintenance time and have a capital investment because they see a return on those things.
What is, effectively, saying is this:
"Home PC users have things Data Centers do not. Home PC users don't have to pay for engineers, maintenance or infrastructure." But there are very good reasons why these organizations pay for those things.
Regardless, a system is not sustainable if it requires participants to take a mandatory loss. 
Actually do the math, the proposal is that 1,000,000 each spend $.01 each day. $3.65 a year. Why the Hell would anyone think twice about a system that requires it's participants to waste $3.65 million dollars a year? 
Plus, until growth actually slows down the home miner is going to have reinvestments. Just look at what it would have taken a home miner from 4 years ago to keep pace with the arms race.

Bitcoin has been around for 5ish+ years and the 100,000+ holders have been doing just fine. It's the cheerleaders that have hopped on board in the past year that are the problem.
You don't actually contribute anything of value. No code. No ideas. No words. Nothing that actually helps anyone. Instead you post airy platitudes on boards making suggestions for things everyone else should do. Your problems are your own but you are unhappy unless you can drag us in to the morass with you.
The icing on the cake is that you don't have the ability to even speak intelligently about your chosen SJW topic and you do more harm than good. 
But you won't hesitate a second to point the finger back at the people who actually are helping and accuse them when they present you with the reality that you are the cancer, you are the problem, you need to change.

Someone can tell you the stove is hot and maybe you won't touch it. You can put a big warning sign on the stove and people will probably still touch it. You can let a person burn themselves on a stove and see how many times they touch it again after that.
The lack of empathy/compassion from the community when someone loses their coins because they **chose** not to follow simple instructions is not a shortcoming of the community. It's pride and confidence that we know what we are doing. 
Every time someone loses their coins it's a story that gets retold. I would rather the message be about the "assholes in the community who said you should have secured your shit" because after the story is told that message is remembered. 
The most value that can come out of the pity posts about stolen coins is the lesson to future users. If being dicks is the only way that message gets out - considering that "nice" has lead us to users losing coins now - I don't mind hurting the feelings of internet randos because of their own action and ignorance to possibly help many more down the road.

"Where do I start a petition to raise the IQ and kernel knowledge of people?
Guys, go read drivers/char/random.c. Then, learn about cryptography. Finally, come back here and admit to the world that you were wrong.
Short answer: we actually know what we are doing. You don't.
Long answer: we use rdrand as _one_ of many inputs into the random pool, and we use it as a way to _improve_ that random pool. So even if rdrand were to be back-doored by the NSA, our use of rdrand actually improves the quality of the random numbers you get from /dev/random.

No, hyper inflation favors the recipients of the new money after it is printed/created. Those are the people who get to spend that money at the old price because they spend it before the money goes in to circulation.
Destruction of savings is a side affect. 
It's like a change in paradigm. Those old debts still exist but during that period $50k was the value of a house. After inflation the dollar buys less because there is a higher supply. The house may cost $500,000 but no one has that kind of money to buy your house. 
Raises in pay happen last to match inflation. If at all. Because a business cannot afford to spend more because it cannot take out loans.
Prices go up to make sure the producer gets as close to the same  amount of value in dollars as before inflation.
Also, interest rates go up by insane amounts. If the value of a currency halves each month the interest has to compound such that the amount you pay on the loan scales.
So goodbye lending. Why would anyone take a loan out if they have to pay it in full each month just in interest to scale with inflation?

In short, block size is supply and demand for mining fees.
1 tx / minute = transaction processing is scarce, higher fees paid to miners to be included in a block.
unlimited tx  = CPU resources unavailable to many, mining becomes centralized, no one pays any fees because there is no scarcity.
Must find happy medium for block size.
I think we do .7/7 tx a second now. Lots of room in the blocks still

The problem is that every market has rational actors who appear completely irrational to other rational actors.
E.g. There are multiple ways to participate in Bitcoin. When someone ignores that thousands of hours of effort put towards helping educate them on their wallet it makes sense that we are viewed as dicks because we chastise them after-the-fact. Interests overlap.
The real dicks are the ones losing their bitcoins. They're ignoring our hard work.

1000 bits
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:29:17
There really isn't such thing as sending them "to yourself". It's the exact same thing. 
A transaction is made up of inputs and outputs. Every input is an output from a previous transaction. Every coin can be traced back to a coinbase - A transaction with no input, the reward for mining. 
When you make a transaction you supply the keys to unlock the old transaction and sign the balance to another key in the output. 
If you have received 10, 5 and 15 bitcoins and you send me 16 you have three ways to send me coins. 
1. Reference outputs for 10 and 15 as inputs. My 16 is an output. You create a second output for yourself for 9, less fees. Almost every time you send bitcoin you make a change transaction to yourself. 
2. Same for 5 and 15 as inputs. Only you send yourself 4 in change.
3. Same for 10, 5 and 15 as inputs. Only you send yourself 14 in change.

If I wanted to pass a law in a Democracy I can guarantee it passes every time.
All I do is propose a new law that charges each tax payer $1. In America, that's about $100,000,000 dollars. Actually a little more but its just an example.
I tell the lawmakers I want $.50 of each dollar collected. I run an organization "For the Children." We get half, government keeps half. 
I can spend up to $50,000,000 advertising, educating, framing the argument and buying the politicians I need with that money. 
Every other tax payer can spend up to $1 before they are losing money.
Democracy is the worst form of government. These laws pass all the time, every time. If you want any organization to fail, implement a Democracy.
Even in a pure Democracy, I can always bribe 51% with the other 49%'s own money. Or just a small special interest that will show up to vote. Better yet, bribe everyone with the possibility of getting their own money back! Of course, I choose how it is spent, first.

You aren't special. You don't provide a good or service anyone wants.

Simultaneously, they bleed $150,000 a month. 
**This community did not donate to the Bitcoin Foundation so that it's members could enjoy living the next 3-4 years rent free**

I always take it as an insult from the victim towards the community.
We have a community of people who work very hard - for free - to insure that materials are made readily available to educate and help new people.
Outside of exchanges/sites warning not to store coins there (which the community screams bloody murder over) it is impossible to be anything other than negligent if your coins are stolen.
Never, ever, has someone posted an "My Bitcoins were stolen and I did everything you told me"
**The community responds to those people like dicks because the person was given every opportunity to succeed. They chose to go their own way and now have only themselves to blame for the repercussions of their actions. They post looking for empathy or in a pseudo-martydom style such as "I lost my coins, here's how so you don't too" which is just an outlet for their own grief at further expense to our community.**

I think these are some of the things Gavin talked about with achieving consensus among the developers. 
All great questions. 
I'll try to help to answer these questions (author of article here)
1.) Yes the TX cannot be mined. In the article I mentioned tx's can expire. From my research/experience if you broadcast a locked TX it will sit in the mem pool until it is timed to be mined. If a node shuts down the mem pool is cleared. Effectively, for your broadcast TX to 'expire' all nodes with the tx in its mempool would need to be turned off - basically this will never happen.
A second option is printing the transaction and then deleting the keys used to make the tx. You could deposit the coins in a shared multisig wallet between employer and employee. The multisig could send the locked TX for the employee's paycheck two weeks in the future. Without the employer/employee multisig the coins could not be doublespent. 
So there are still use cases for the current functionality but CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY greatly extends functionality by making it possible to lock the coins until the timer expires. I believe this would require something being mined especially since Todd talks about using CHECKLOCK... to replace nLockTime eventually.
So I believe you are correct, it would have to enter the blockchain right away to prevent those inputs from being claimed on another TX.
Your last part Todd talks about with the proof of burn/proof of mining sacrifice. Yes, effectively you can use this to forever lock coins, e.g. lock them for 999999999 years. Or as a time capsule, retirement fund, trust, inheritance, etc.
@_date: 2014-12-04 22:08:00
Likely, it will be passed and then the moratorium will hit.
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:35:42
Is your question "If you have two different private keys that map to the same 160 bit address can you do anything fun?"
I guess that depends on your definition of fun. I doubt both sets of keys could claim the same inputs. Otherwise, it would be a race to claim them against the other person like when you use the same wallet.dat on separate machines. But I don't know because the private/public keys would be different and unable to unlock anything encrypted by the true public key. 
E.g. just because the public key maps to the same 160 bit addy doesn't mean the private key will unlock anything encrypted by the paired public key. Paired at the address layer I guess.
I don't even know of this ever occuring in reality and the paper explains why it would be a waste of effort/time to really even research it.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:37:00
You're fighting the wrong battle.
I get it, in America kids are told their entire lives to vote, that politicians care and that laws will help you.
So when you folks get hit by reality there are always these words like, "should", "ought", "could" and those are dangerous, poisonous words because they keep you from looking at "does", "will" and "is."
It keeps kids chasing their tails, if we just vote enough next time, if we just yell louder, if we just try harder... a politician will listen. 
Instead of looking at Due Process as the perfect example of why government cannot control itself - and then laughing at government being the arbiter of Due Process - kids gravitate towards it, begin to admire and love it and wish to become a part of it. 
They give their entire lives to working for the system in the hope that someday, somehow they will have worked hard enough to be rewarded and they will be given the power to change the system from within - for the better!
State/Government worship is the same disease as religion and putting the opposite sex up on a pedestal. 
Truthfully, the real tragedy is that it took you to the DPR trial to even take a look at these things. To say, now, that due process has been thrown out, because this happens to be the current headline that has caught your eye, isn't just ignorant but it's insulting to everyone who has been saying so for a very long time that something is wrong.

Bitcoin is simple. 
Think of it like a neutral currency. It just is. 
If every other currency starts being "bad" Bitcoin is still neutral. Maybe you like something a fiat currency is doing. That's fine, hold that fiat currency. Maybe you don't. 
Bitcoin is important because it is an option. If you don't think it has any benefits to you, don't use it. It's that simple. 
If the world is offering you something that is in your best interest do it. With Bitcoin, we have a chance to have a say in what that best interest is instead of abstracting it to unelected politicians and bureaucrats.

Inflation may make it easier for you to pay your debt since the original debt was prescribed during the old money supply.
You are not accounting for every. other. thing. in your life costing more as a result.

Why would you even need money to be involved?
I think this is the heart of the confusion. This is going to be proprietary, yeah yeah the code is opensource but in IBM's case they are going to sell and license management platforms. 
You can have your IOT block chain for free but it may only run on IBM hardware. It may always require IBM licensed software to work. That's how business works.
Based on my own work and exchanges with these folks the block chain will be used entirely different from Bitcoin. It's going to be a backbone for communications and have nothing to do with currency.
Any pundit or person who thinks block chains are inseparable from Bitcoin is short sighted and missing the entire point of the technology.
So how about some substance:
Would it need others to mine:
No, why the hell would they do that? Why would they have to use a double SHA256 proof of work? They could use anything they wanted. It doesn't even have to require any 'work'. 
They could setup their own dedicated hardware to 'mine' some esoteric and proprietary algorithm of their own or one that already works on hardware that is proprietary to them. 
Incentive comes from the licenses they sell. IBM leases everything and makes their money off support contracts. 
There are no new coins... Do you even understand how Bitcoin works? There is no such thing as an actual bitcoin. The things we refer to as bitcoins are literally balances in a ledger. The block chain doesn't have to be a ledger. The protocol can have whatever rules it wants. 
Why the hell would you need to deposit cash anywhere? IBM's IOT implementation of a block chain has absolutely nothing to do with money. Instead of storing balances their block chain is designed to store the state and status of devices... 
**Why not run all nodes.**
Well no shit. How about IBM just opens their own, proprietary, farm that they use to secure the licenses they sell for other companies? Do you think healthcare companies want to worry about block chains and infrastructure? Do you think most industries that just finished moving to the cloud want to hear "Buy new shit you need it"
Before I go any farther, are you 12 or just have no idea how Bitcoin or the world works?
Why have a block chain?
Because they can do things VPNs can't. That you would even suggest a VPN as an alternative to block chains is astounding. 
Please stop posting FUD. You have no idea what you are talking about. You haven't even grasped the basic of Bitcoin and are already trying to comment on technology that is a completely different spirit from Bitcoin. 
Tiny-minded and short-sighted individuals who don't have the nerve to do their own research before sharing their opinions are the problem with this world. Stop being part of the problem and put the effort in to be one of the good guys.

Again, fighting the wrong battle. No one is arguing with you. You are trying to endlessly explain yourself in the hope that something is going to 'click' in my brain and I will magically come over to your side. This is probably the same reason why everyone you try to "convince" looks at you like you are insane before slowly walking away from you.


You are most definitely not anti-state. It's been pointed out. Literally, each reply from you is the same thing and each time I point it out, show you and you just re-parse the same tired platitudes and think I won't notice.


"I just don't have the energy to care to explain either right now. There are only so many outs."

It's my understanding all of the coins seized are tied to the Silk Road. 
I'm sorry, but the level of frustration for this is so high because it's difficult for me to explain this. 
Not because the material is esoteric or difficult to explain. I just haven't associated with people who are two-fold ignorant of the actual law in writing and then ignorant of the actual law in practice. 
The short answer is this is the fucking US government. The fuck do you think they are going to do?
The long answer drones on and on about the definition of property, civil forfeiture and judging legislation based on intention instead of affect.
I just don't have the energy to care to explain either right now. There are only so many outs.
The first, you agree with me, the government does what it wants. This would be true and is basically the answer. Your response seems to mitigate this one.
The second is you disagree with me and then you want to dive in to legislation and show how it's written on some line somewhere by some asshole that the government can't do this. We can go back and forth forever on this one but it just affirms my "the fuck you think they are going to do" sentiment
The third is the argument over semantic, definition or ideal whereby you point to something I said or something written and try to tell me how it doesn't fit the law I cite to you. Which is also pointless for me because of my (hopefully) revealed political leanings by this point. 
This rant is not really about you and it doesn't even address the question. I just don't have the energy to go down this road with another person, again.

Today we are seeing a huge change in payment technology. Whether it's digital convergence or cryptocurrencies.
There's a real opportunity in Asia for MasterCard and our pals to lock down the marketplace and legislate our way to a position where no competitors can enter in to competition with us. We do this by partnering with governments and ensuring we have enough politicians on our side - not necessarily because we offer products that are a good value to the consumer.
Bitcoin is scary. I keep hearing about it on the news and I don't know what it is. I can't proxy government to send cease and desist orders or thugs in costume to the creator/business owners home to fine/extort or kidnap them, or otherwise use the political power I paid for to stop it.
We are not comfortable with cryptocurrency because they go completely against everything we've founded our business on - milking the economic classes that exists outside the finance industry to the breaking point - and that might stop us from reaching that goal.
We've been working on that for a century, dammit. And it's not fair. I want my hegemony. You little people just don't understand how much time and effort and resources have gone in to this. If you don't let MasterCard realize our dream then what are you? You plebs should be thanking MasterCard. Without us, what would any of you do?
In fact, now that I am thinking about it for the first time. What's the point of cryptocurrency anyway? Our goal the entire time has been to transition away from using money. Ordinary people have no use for a store of value. That's why we love the inflationary monetary policy that forces people to continue working because their savings lose value.
Don't you peasants know you need regulators? Without having control over the system my friends and I cannot control you. Why would you ever want to be anonymous?

Thank you for replying.
I won't grill you on budgets. Of all the members of the foundation I wish your model was followed. I think you communicate, clearly, your direction and the reasons for your decisions. I feel that you explain the problem before your solution and do a damn fine job of explaining what is important and why. And you provide the means to measure your work
When a company is burning through its reserves while increasingly holding its hand tighter to its chest it means there is bad news. It makes the AMA series look like pure fundraising PR, especially with the airy and ambiguous answers so far. 
Outside of yourself, TBF screams mismanagement, lack of communication and no direction. The donated coins would have better served the community had they gone to a developer faucet or straight to pay full time developers. $7M worth of full time Bitcoin developers? The Foundation will never be able to do more good than that.

No they aren't. The cost of today's miners goes down because tomorrow's miners jump by leaps and bounds in hash rate. It deprecates because it literally has a finite return/lifespan measured in weeks/months sometimes.

Thank you for posting a follow up.
I think these AMAs are setting themselves up to be massive train wrecks because TBF has many questions hanging around the room that they politely ignore or sidestep. 
It's very clear by TBF's actions that it has no interest in being part of the Bitcoin community beyond appearances. There is no reason for anyone to support TBF
Edit: Continuing, if the foundation is putting the interests of its corporate backers ahead of the interests of those who donated it's $7M seeding just further shows how detached TBF is and why no one here should buy in to the balony.

No this will never happen.
I had a nice write up a while ago but I'll explain briefly.
There are something like 2^256 total bitcoin private keys. There are 2^82 atoms in the universe. It's been shown how we don't have enough energy/matter in the universe to actually compute them all based on the smallest unit amount of energy theoretically possible to store 1 bit of data. 
I think cryptographically secure is considered anything over 2^70. 
Your first question:
Wouldn't the private keys have to be the same? No.
A private/publickey is any 256 digit number. An address is only 160 digits. You are squashing large numbers in to smaller numbers. The large numbers can be different but end up with the same, smaller, hash. It's very rare and unlikely to occur.
That's a collision. It doesn't have to be big to small, but that murkies the water. In your question it looks like you say "The same private key hashes to the same address twice" and that's true. Hashes are one way and the same input always gets the same output. But when the input is larger than the output there is a chance collisions occur.
Essentially you have 160 digits worth of "symbol" combinations to represent 256 digits worth of "data." It's just not possible. Think about pouring shots from a bottle of booze. You'll never fit the entire bottle in a single shot glass but on very very rare occasions you or someone else will pour a shot with the exact amount of booze in it as you or someone else has at some time in the past. Bad analogy but kind of the same idea.
For your last question. Yeah but no.
See above about how many numbers there are. It's basically the same thing as saying "I start my wallet and it generates a key someone else is using or have used before." It's extremely unlikely.
Furthermore, there is something called a birthday attack. I won't explain that in depth but Bitcoin is protected from this attack and it is very similar to what you are asking at the end.

The limit would likely be restricted by the size of the lock_field which is 4 bytes. 
So about 4,294,967,295 blocks. Lock times are measured in blocks. So 43,000,000,000 minutes or roughly 82,000 years.
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:45:34


And how does that help the code?


It's certainly applicable. You're just choosing a limited definition for reserves because you know if a large enough portion of the public called for TBF to be transparent it wouldn't be able to satisfy the request.
Thanks for your lip service. 


This is a complete cop out. It's admitting "When we hired people we told them a completely different message than what we told everyone else. The people working for us are not passionate about our message and are only here because they are being paid." 
Those are the wrong people. Otherwise it wouldn't surprise them or they wouldn't be worried about violating their 'privacy.' Which is complete bullshit and can be managed such that they get paid and keep their privacy.

That's your moral adventure. I don't care about breaking the masses out of anything. In fact, I don't care about the masses at all. I care about individuals.
But who are you to judge them? Who are you to 'break them out'? Maybe they don't want your help and the rest of us need help getting away from them. See what I said about fighting the wrong battle.






Remember the part where I called "semantics." We are not agreeing. Rather, I feel like you think we agree because in your 'gut' you think what I am saying resonates with you. Nothing you say resonates with me. It is black and white and you are trying to be grey. 
The state has no purpose. Any effort made by the state is a step out of bounds because any step or effort made by the state is rooted in violence. 
So you can keep making up your own arbitrary borders for where you think the state applies and where it does not. I am firmly of the mind that there is no use for the state and every effort should be opposed. 
(This is where you bring up 'changing it from within' again)

There's no debate. It's acknowledged that the size is increasing.
There are two camps -
The first gets this. They understand change control. They realize there is a process in place that got Bitcoin to where we are right now. 
The second doesn't get this. They understand yelling loudly and stamping their feet when they don't get their way. They want a charismatic leader who will tell them they can have their way.

That's hype. Your coins will be on both chains. Not switching to XT is supporting Bitcoin and ignoring dictators who throw tantrums.
@_date: 2015-08-18 18:54:57
No, you see once XT begins accepting blocks that are non-standard with the rest of the network it's possible to spend coins on both chains. Once that happens the chains become irreconcilable. 
What I just shared is an attack on XT that would permanently define it as a separate block chain. If I take my hash power right back anyone could come along and 51% XT. Technically, if I am the dominate miner on XT's new chain then I can just 51% all day until someone challenges me. Which wouldn't matter. The chain is compromised

And this will be further obscured by those wishing to force a change into source now. 
We haven't hit peak capacity in Bitcoin. Even during these silly community-led stress tests. One group sees the number of commits per block as a limiter the other realizes a 0 conf tx is just as good as a conf tx after a few seconds.

I find security in unilateral decisions.
I want there to be a single point of failure.
Only one or two developers should control Bitcoin and decisions should be made based on how loud we complain at them.
The change process that brought us to this point was too robust.

So if I control, say, 30% of the hash rate. 
I mine 1 block and fill it with my own transactions to make it, say, 5MiB. 
I then immediately switch back to mining &lt;1MiB blocks. 
I mine another block.
I spend some of the same bitcoins in the smaller block. 
I continue to mine on the &lt; 1MiB chain and wait for the actual change control process to take place instead of following a guy throwing a tantrum about how he sees Bitcoin.
Now what?

No, not at all. One sec.
It's a fork. Which is like saying "We start a completely new coin. Instead of just a genesis block, we also premine. Instead of just mining ourselves we use Bitcoin's block chain to establish our premine." 
If XT forks from Bitcoin then they are completely separate coins. Basically, as soon as the same coins are spent on both chains they become irreconcilable. The shorter chain is a separate crypto now. All coins before the fork exist in both chains. 
 
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:02:44
The biggest flaw about these posts is they think Bitcoin will replace the old instead of creating new. That's innovation and wealth creation. Bitcoin won't replace anything.

Bitcoin was founded for an entirely different purpose. Perhaps if your side could tell the difference we could avoid having these discussions.
@_date: 2015-08-15 02:11:18
Eh, I still disagree. In a couple ways. 
I mean, is it really a consensus driven protocol? If 80% of Bitcoin users voted for a change would that necessarily affect 80% of the mining power? I mean, sure I agree it's a mining consensus. But that's not relevant to what we're talking about - Reddit's Bitcoin community. 
You can respect everyone's opinion. I don't particularly care about just anyone's opinion, though. Your right to care is the same as mine not to. It would be nice to admire Bitcoin as a consensus driven masterpiece but a public masterpiece is just impossible. In the least, it is not represented by Bitcoin

So... you wouldn't want someone in a murder debate to pause and reflect? Regardless of their position?
It doesn't matter how good it sounds prima facie. When something sounds certain it deserves higher scrutiny. Morally blurry areas will receive the attention/debate they deserve just by their nature while the idea solidifies.
There are perfectly moral reason for murder - self-defense. The defense of others. In accordance with a force continuum, of course. Treat others the way you want to be treated and only respond with violence out of self-defense and never with more violence than is shown toward you. 
Sadly society has surrendered this responsibility to government so *of course it makes sense to say all murder is wrong. Vengeance is for the ~~lord~~ government*

Through XT Hearn is literally saying "Hey, I have this altcoin with the exact rules as Bitcoin. Except, I am charismatic and will make the changes *YOU* want. Just jump ship to my coin... which used Bitcoin's block chain as a pre-mine. So instead of leaving behind your coins or having to trade them at the exchange everyone has credit for what they have now."
Since Hearn is in control of XT he would then be the sole arbiter of what constitutes Bitcoin after that. Once coins from the original chain are spent on both forks they become irreconcilable. Meaning, they officially become separate coins.
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:01:32
