Did you even read that article? Not once did it actually provide any evidence as to why deflation is better than inflation (it's not) it just stated that it is then went on about why inflation is bad, but not why deflation is good at all. My favorite part is that the article agrees with exactly what I said happens when deflation occurs (where people hold money instead of using it), and just glosses over it.
And yes, inflation is bad, but it is believed to be better than the alternatives when you look at the overall health of the Economy. 
And since you provided an article for your viewpoint (even though yours was written by Economists which you say are mostly shills for the government) I thought I should provide one for mine. It's written by a magazine catering to businessmen, so you can't dismiss it as being written by economist shills, and I didn't even have to search far and wide for an obscure school to support my argument: 
And if you want to see an example of this you don't need to look any further than crypto currency. If you look all over this subreddit you will see people telling others to hold, or that they have held since a certain price. This is happening because crypto currency is speculated to appreciate in value over time so people are afraid to spend it. If the entire world's economy used crypto then it would have already collapsed by now due to a huge economic slowdown. Crypto is, in effect, experiencing deflation right now.

Do you even know why they do it?

Nah, there's a much more sensible reason actually. 
It's because most Economists agree that inflation is much better than both deflation and no inflation/deflation at all for the economy. This is because a low amount of inflation (around 2% is ideal) encourages citizens to do things with their money, whether it's buying assets or investing, instead of just holding it. This situation is better for the Economy as a whole in the long run.

Gotcha, you're the bestest broski! I think I'll be getting into the Bitcoin game as soon as coinbase can verify my identity

So I'm new to this whole Bitcoin thing. I know that it's split into Bitcoin gold and BCash, but I don't get why everyone is saying that BCash is a scam. 
Could someone explain that to me?
