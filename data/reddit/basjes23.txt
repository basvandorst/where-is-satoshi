Finally, the esp32 has arrived.
But i dont understand what u mean with ------Using the Oled Driver from library manager "ESP8266 and ESP32 Oled Driver for SSD1306 display"------
I cant find that driver u mentioning?

I think i just dont understand the software with the esp32.
If i try File&gt;Examples&gt;any option&gt;upload it to my esp32, i get orange coding letters and the last 2 words are Leaving...
Hard resetting...
I dont really know what im doing though, before buying the esp32 it looked kinda easy, well not for me atleast.
Thank so far, maybe you see the problem after reading this :)

Hard resetting...

This is awesome, thank you so much for sharing.
I was looking for something like this and was willing to pay 50 bucks for it(glad i didnt buy it). Bought 2 of these now, thanks again
I will make a box around it with only the display visible, will look smooth hopefully
