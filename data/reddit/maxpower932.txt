I down vote you too and your garbage. Who you think you are? Some people thinks they master new technologies and show so much arrogance. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are pointless to the people. It only give an advantage to a short "elite" of people with knowledge and time to do this at full time. Otherwise it's not profitable and damaging for the rest of the society who work to earn money. Bitcoin is false money. Money is a common legal thing, otherwise it have no value at all. Anarcho-capitalism will not save the world but it will give full power to banksters and big orwellian private corporations. And it's more and more difficult as mining takes more and more computational power. It's not profitable anymore with a simple PC. So it's not democratic anymore. Some miners have been forced to steal power from neighborhood just to keep their power-sucking rig above losses.

Anti-Bitcoin propaganda? And what about pro-Bitcoin brainwashing? Sceptics are trolls? And what about you? Internet and the mainstream press is full of pro-Bitcoin propaganda stating that it's a new way to "make" money. It's so stupid to think that it's democratic and sustainable. It's the contrary, it will become a private money hold by only those who have huge industrial supercomputers and with no democratic control at all. You can forget the FED to fuel the economy. Crypto-currencies are the banksters new weapon against the people. When Goldman Sachs says they don't like Bitcoins they blatantly lie. Stop beeing a sheep!
