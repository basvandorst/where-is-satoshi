It'll always be this way. With the ease of creating new currencies, if someone in a position of authority decides to take the technology seriously, they will not be using Bitcoin when they enforce adoption. Bitcoin is and will always remain speculative and will eventually fade as newer purpose-designed currencies replace it in actual use.

So....no interest in discussing the actual message? Do you believe it's in Bitcoin's best interest that so many people can be manipulated here by billion dollar investment companies with a well-designed tagline, gif, or jpg? Why is it acceptable that this community is allowing people to give financial advice in this manner, when it's extremely likely that advice is being given so that the advisor can profit from it?

I see that, but teamwork in this environment is inherently dangerous. Teamwork implies there's another team, and some of the people on your team, team HODL, may not realize that there are adversaries in the game. Also, the longer you HODL, the more likely your teammates are to turn on you.

So, to you, bitcoin is a hedge against the value of the USD. If that's the case, is it better for the sake of your investment in bitcoin that it can be manipulated through this community by use of memes, or that memes not be allowed so that the market value of Bitcoin more accurately reflects it's true value? The central premise of Bitcoin, written RIGHT IN THE SIDE COLUMN, is that it is...


But this community has an enormous influence over the currency, as over half of the market cap is likely held by people who read posts here every day. And that means, if you manipulate this subreddit, you can manipulate the currency in much the same way as large banks, companies, or governments could a fiat dollar. Short of breaking up the subreddit, banning memes seems like the next best thing for the health of the currency.
The HODL meme has the same result as a central bank which encourages savings by raising interest rates. Even if the methods are different, if some outside actor is able to influence a large portion of the market by constructing a message to manipulate this community, then how is Bitcoin different from fiat currency?

Put down the Kool-Aid for a moment and look beyond the immediate situation.
Eventually, a government or corporation will create a centralized digital currency, and adopting it will not be a choice. If China establishes a digital currency next year and issues citizens a digital wallet device, their citizens will not have a say in wether their employer starts paying them with that new currency instead of paper. They will not have a say in whether their purchases are tracked, or whether their currency can be traded to non-Chinese citizens or if it remains within the Great Firewall.
If Apple makes a digital currency and that new currency is the only way you can pay for apps, music, tv shows, or the next iPhone...will Apple fans adopt their currency?
If the US Government cracks down on Bitcoin and you can't buy it with your VISA anymore and you can't cash it into a US bank account and you can't trade it without minimum 10 year jail time if caught, do you think it matters that it's decentralized?
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:44:00
Is China going to give their citizens a choice to adopt? If congress passes a bill that establishes a new centralized digital currency that is pegged to the USD and taxes (or eradicates) bitcoin/ethereum/everything else out of existence, it's still going to be adopted by far more people than Bitcoin has been.

I mean I could go into how dangerous that will one day be to personal freedom as governments like China (and short to follow, the United States) create a digital currency, tag it to their physical currency, then phase out their physical currency so that they can track every single transaction in the country...but that's off-topic. I understand the hope that HODLing leads to future gain, I'm just trying to open people's eyes to what I see going on here, an actual campaign to manipulate the currency through this community, so that bad actors can profit off of us.

Honestly, now that I think about it, this post was never going to serve it's original purpose. The patsies I'm describing wouldn't be saved if Warren Buffet himself were here giving them individually-tailored advice. Because people in don't see themselves as investors, they see themselves as gold miners that struck it rich. They think they're going to take that gold back home and sit fancy for the rest of their lives, but there are far more bandits in the hills than they realize. I feel like I just saw how sausage is made, but instead of with pigs and cows, it's with people's hopes and dreams.

I'm not mad. I've used bitcoin in the past as a currency, but I'm not interested in using it as an investment. Mainly because I see a site [like this]( one and I realize how easy it is to create a digital currency, and how likely it is that no digital currency will be a viable long-term investment until it's backed by a centralized authority such as a government or corporation.

I'm currently writing a dystopian novel on this pandora's box we're dancing around. This post was research. Ever want something so much that it keeps you awake at night, that it sucks the taste out of your food, that you can't see what's right in front of you because you're so lost in your desire? I desire proof that I'm wrong.
I see a future where the sheep I was trying to arm here are discarded once the wolves have fed and no longer hunger, when labor has no value because the vast majority of work can be done by unpaid slaves, AI and robots.
I don't see digital currencies as a means of liberation for the many, instead I see it as a weapon to be used by the privileged few to cull the herds. If the 0.1% no longer have need of our labor, they no longer have need of us at all. And Bitcoin et al are a bloodless weapon that can be used to exclude the general public, to starve them to extinction and only the privileged are left behind.
I'll probably finish writing this book by the end of the year and then lock it away, because I'm afraid if I talk about this vision too much, a wolf will hear.
By the way, are you a wolf or a sheep?

So would you agree that direct democracy would work at the city level? How about at the state level? How about as a replacement to the US House?
Also, there are methods that could be devised to preserve the compartmentalization while encouraging more participation and less *representation*. For example, you could take our current representatives in the House and replace them with a Direct Democracy vote from their respective districts. I could think of a million alternatives, but in such an example legislation would originate in the Senate but require a popular vote for passage. I don't see how this is anything but a popular idea when public opinion for our House and Senate are at their present level.
Sorry if mistakes, am drunk.

I'm not an economist, but I believe the problem for Bitcoin's stability should be immediately apparent. Bitcoin is instable because people, when paid for goods or services in Bitcoin, seek to immediately convert it back to whichever currency they transact regular business.
Let's take the example of a jeweler who has the option to buy with bitcoin. Are they retaining bitcoin to then conduct further business with? No. They can't get their supplies (gold, jewels, or equipment) with Bitcoin. They can't pay their bills with Bitcoin. They can't even pay for shipping with Bitcoin. Until they can, they will necessarily need to immediately convert to a more accepted currency. Look at Bitpay, so many vendors are adopting it because it's simple and they *don't have to hold bitcoin,* they get a cash deposit to their bank account daily. This problem will not go away overnight, but it is surmountable. As more businesses opt to conduct their business with bitcoin, particularly supply chain-side transactions, you'll begin to see vendors retaining Bitcoin, and that retention is what will add stable value.

Imagine if the Fed started printing money to buy BTC? Or worse...mining it. They could research and develop their own ASIC farm. Then once they hold a sizeable portion of the market...it's not that different from being able to print money; they hold the value of the currency under their control.
The scary thing about bitcoin that I don't think some people realize is that the government isn't the only person that could do this. Any significantly wealthy, motivated individual or party could essentially become a bitcoin regulator.

Why is it that you think direct democracy could only work at a smaller scale, and not at the national level? At what point does it no longer become feasible: a population of 10,000? 100,000? 100,000,000? Or put another way, *of course* local law should be handled through direct democracy. And then perhaps issues such as abortion rights, gun control, abortion and others wouldn't be national issues--because cities/states/regions would adopt their own policies and leave the rest of us largely alone.
It's not difficult to imagine protections for minorities if DD were introduced at the national level, in fact I think the Senate as it currently exists would do just fine, in addition to a Presidential veto and the Supreme Court.


Easily handled by having semi-annual or quarterly elections. Most people participate from home, while those who need assistance either go to a central location or whatever special exceptions are made for elections today. I think the large majority would prefer to vote from the comfort of their own home and with a more convenient voting window (why not a whole weekend?), don't you?


Why would you expect volunteers to run the website? What's wrong with a state-run website?


That's the nature of humanity. We are keen to give our power to others when the issues aren't important to us. The problem is that, under the current system, when the issues are important to us, we don't have the means to retake said power and apply it as we see fit. We invest our power PERMANENTLY in the hands of another, and they often wield it against our best interests. At least with a form of direct democracy, even if you decide to vote in favor of some popular opinion whose reasoning you've chosen to adopt, you always have the ability to change your mind.


Struggles for power are inevitable, no matter the system. Checks and balances don't have to be discarded wholesale just because you're introducing direct democracy into the mix. Replace the legislative branch (or just the House or Senate) with some form of direct democracy, and you get the best of both worlds.
I think the biggest problem with direct democracy is that it's **never** been tested at the scale that we're debating. We could dream and discuss and theorize all we want, but eventually somebody will have to try it or we'll never know if it could work. Considering how hot our congress has been doing for the last decade or so, there's never been a better time.

Just because you're on a mac doesn't mean you're not owned :x [Note: I'm on a Mac, too.] There are a lot of potential culprits: a sleazy app or a browser extension are possible. Insecure wireless (unencrypted or WEP)? A man in the middle is unlikely, but the unique nature of bitcoin has made it a high target for hackers since it's basically free and easy money if they find an account on an owned device. I'd be concerned about doing any further high-risk activities on the same device until you are sure it's safe to use again.

Interesting you should mention Neal Stephenson. I've been reading Cryptonomicon this last week, in which the (spoiler alert) plot revolves around a plan to create an online currency that's cryptography oriented. In the novel, at least the point I'm at, it's proposed to be backed by gold and the system would be centralized instead of decentralized, but the concept is still stunning to read since the novel is over a decade old now.
Also, Stephenson is a phenomenal author and I loved his other two books that I've read (Diamond Age and Snowcrash). It's tempting to just hit the library and pick up the rest of his works in chronological order, as I'm fascinated by his ability to create such deep, humorous, groundbreaking sci-fi works.

You're drawing conclusions from information not present in these slides. All we know is a presentation was prepared detailing known methods to attack Tor, NOT what is presently used or had been used successfully. I consider it unlikely that they've done this much work and not put it to use. The recent takedown of Silk Road and freedom hosting are both very interesting cases of potential Tor exploitation.
