A ton of comments already point out that 90% is too much so I don't have to reiterate that, but I would like to warn you against going above that percentage. Always make sure you have a enough liquidity in case of emergencies. That extra money can also come in handy in case the price of BTC drops and you want to buy some on the cheap.

It's generally a bad idea to keep your savings in a savings account. In 1989 if you took that $4.50 and put it in the stock market instead of buying a movie ticket you'd have $29.29 today. Far outpacing the rate of inflation.

I would have assumed true Bitcoin believers already had most of their money in BTC.

You said you only bought in this year so I was just making sure you were aware. Sorry if it came off wrong, but unfortunately I still meet plenty of people who don't understand this.

It's worse. In the US most banks are FDIC insured for $250,000.

If it ever gets to the point where the US dollar is worthless it won't matter how much BTC you have.

I haven't seen that comment of his, but it seems right up his alley. For context, it's the same Warren Buffet that became the world's richest person due to his investing prowess. You're right that you shouldn't be taking quotes out of context, but comment reminded me of Buffet's so I thought it was rather fitting.

Just in case you're in the US a word of advice: The IRS sees Bitcoin as a taxable investment. You should be keeping track of any purchases you make using BTC and maintain some sort log so you're ready for tax season.
