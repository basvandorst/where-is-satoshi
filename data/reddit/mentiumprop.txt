Just an update - they come back and stated the following: 
"You don't need to correct the phone number or email. The phone number/email is automatically assigned for each user. In general, you can just leave all the information unchanged, the information is only for Golden card usage. Please re-submit the signed document."
Very copy paste answer, I will reference the legal document, and re-state that I am legally responsible for the accuracy. And request a letter in writing expressing the reasons why. Lets see how customer services respond.

Good sign - too many people trying to buy back in

I went through the same process - then the form got me, they assigned a number and email from them. Based on reviews, it seems legit and works. But I still changed it to my own email and number, as I am "legally" responsible for the accuracy. Sent it in and waiting for the response. 
Note I called the number they assigned- and it rang but did not connect. And the email address domain does not exist as a website. i.e myname - and according to  it is a domain by proxy. Why would they need to hide our contact details? 
According to the form - these details are for  the underlying card provider (i.e like WaveCrest to Tenx) and it appears they are hiding the user of the card contact details from them. Not sure if its competition, as the address stays the same, and it appears from the reviews, that cards are getting delivered to the rightful owners. 
I think it is a scammy way of doing it, but if anything they are scamming the GlobalCash provider from this information, and worst case, maybe they could access the account from Global Cash this way. Either way I don't have access to these details, so by changing it to the correct details, we will see if they follow up and issue the card.   
Otherwise, we may have no choice to raise this matter legally, I know I won't let it go.

This also could be true but I find from past experience exchanges get busiest at peak then price declines and also gets busiest when price crashes then price bounces.
Tomorrow we will all find out.

Try 45 days and no response :(

Very true - but short term FUD is upon us - I.e CBOE ETF supposedly delayed for comments - even after 1400

But remember if BTC shows signs of recovery, ALTs have tended to move up faster

Has anyone noticed another 3000 BTC move - just about an hour ago

Me neither, my automatic transaction was cancelled for no apparent reason ��

Which exchanges?

Technically if Fiat can deprecate indefinitely, then in theory a fixed deflationary store of value like BTC, will buy more indefinitely.

No I think they are referring to this

Just an update - they finally corrected it - not sure if it was to do with the Better Bureau Complaint or the proceedings I started for Arbitration or the endless tickets.

It is a possibility - registration of SolidX and CBOE ETFs are the final stages of an ETF. Plus traditionally, approval is done before midterm elections in US. 
Also add that Coinbase custodian service is now ready - all pieces are coming together. 
I’m 60/40 on it happening by end of August.

If coinbase, unlikely they will sell via exchanges, likely it would be for their new OTC system [
