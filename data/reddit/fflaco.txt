If you had moved your coins to gdax, which you can do by no additional registration, and sent the coins from there, the fee for your transfer would have been literally 0.

The sell wall is huge on gdax right now. If it goes how I suspect, very little of those coins will be sold before the price plummets. Your best option I believe is to not put a sell order, stare at the gdax page until the actual trading begin and press the sell button as soon as it does. There are buy orders at 4329.51 right now, very inflated price even compared to other exchanges, and destined to keep on dropping as everybody will be dumping their bcash.

Yeah you're right, that was a bit misleading, gdax/coinbase/whatever, doesn't change that the fees in the network are really high right now. However, a lot of people don't realise that in a lot of situations they could avoid paying that much if they had simply researched a bit.

You can sell instantly on gdax as well, and with much lower fees.

Same happened to me, the worst part is today I had successfully sold high and bought lower 5 straight times this morning, I was up 20% my holdings and feeling invincible. Until I sold again at basically the bottom of the dip, and lost much more than I had made when it immediately bounced back up.

I've done a withdrawal everyday for the past 4 days. First two took 5-6 hours, 4 of which were of pending status on coinbase side. The last two were about 1 hour and 30 minutes, with almost no pending time and most of the duration waiting for network confirmations.

Total fiat amount you have spent/Total amount of Bitcoin you own, it's basic math.

I'm sure they're waiting for a specific amount of liquidity and won't open the trades until they reach it.
