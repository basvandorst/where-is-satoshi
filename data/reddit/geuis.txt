Finally someone with a good explanation for what might be going on. Ok if this is the case then it’s totally understandable.  It they really have failed at communicating that.

Mainly what the most professional, least scammy methods were to sell and convert to USD. I forgot where/how I even bought my btc originally but it seemed straightforward at the time. But this was before the high level of theft that's entered the ecosystem, so I don't know what to expect these days.
I'll take a look at mtgox and coinbase for now and keep researching if I'm not happy with those options.
On a side note, I'm curious about the bias against cashing out. What's the cause? I've seen nearly a 1000% return on my initial investment so I count that as a damn good initial buy. I'm partly reluctant to sell right now, but I have need of the dollars at the moment.

Thanks for the tips. I definitely side with you and the others about holding onto btc and using it as currency, not just investment. If my situation was different, I wouldn't even *think* about selling for regular cash. Once I get everything straightened back out in life I'm doing to be getting back into btc as an actual currency alternative wherever possible.
