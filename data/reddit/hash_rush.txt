What I'm curious is, 17 mil represents the total supply. But, does anyone know the total 'usable' supply? 
What I mean by that is, ignoring any BTC that are somehow permanently inaccessible  \(for example, in hard drives that have been thrown away by accident, or BTC sent to wrong wallets etc etc\)

Excellent news, hopefully the first of many.

Nice! There's always something more interesting about buying stuff with crypto.
My printer (from [alzashop.com]( was the first that I used it on!

It really frustrates me when people talk of Bitcoin as an environmental disaster. My first question for people who blindly write that is, do you even know what the total environmental impact of fiat is?
Not just the power needed to print the money, but the wood/paper needed for the money, the metal that goes into the coins and so on. The entire process to create 1 coin or 1 paper bill is insane, then multiply that by every country. 
The environmental impact is far far worse with fiat than crypto.

That's great to see.
That said, it would be great if the fee's that these ATMs charge would be lowered. In London there are already several Crypto ATMs, but sometimes the fees can be over 10&amp; which is far too much.

The bots are 'funny' to me as they're (most likely) from a camp that disagrees with Lightning, yet they've set them up to use the network (successfully) and are spending Bitcoin to post their images.
I wonder if the bots replace the entire image every time a change is detected (expensive) or just scans to altered pixels and 'fixes' the changed ones.

If you're in Europe then I'd recommend using [Alzashop.com]( for online purchases, they're a (smaller) alternative to Amazon but they directly accept BTC and LTC for purchases. 
But otherwise, great story! It's always delightful to read how people first get involved with Bitcoin and other crypto, so welcome to the family!
My only advice is, if you start to get serious in holding crypto, you may want to consider purchasing a hardware wallet, Ledger or Trezors are the two that come most highly recommended.

A big problem is that a lot of the general public still do not really know that they can buy fractions of a Bitcoin, instead of a whole BTC. It's something that can be fixed with general education, but that will take sometime.

What sort of risks are you talking about? Cause I'm genuinely curious. So far the only ones I know of are compromised devices from 3rd party vendors and a risk if your computer is compromised then it can change the visible address, but both cases the end user is at fault if anything happens, not the actual device.

Those rates are pretty good for BTC ATMs, I'm used to seeing upwards of 10%, so go Poland!
