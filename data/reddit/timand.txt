I believe that there was some issue with the Android PRNG that caused some private keys to be revealed because of non-random k. If RFC6979 was used, there wouldn't have been a problem.

make sure that no one ever sees your private key material. Easy way is get an oldcomputer, install linux, install electrum, permanently disconnect from internet (rip out network card), generate wallet, write down (not print (printers could be infected)) seed, burn entire pad of paper that you wrote on, guard the seed with your life. This should be sufficient for storing at least 20 bitcoins. If you need more security, memorize seed and then burn it.

not necessarily. If you ever spend coins from an address twice, you need to make sure that you generate distinct random numbers for the signatures. A number of Android based wallets have been compromised because Android can't generate random numbers properly.

Bitcoins are not currently infinitely divisible, but they could be in a later release. If divisibility becomes an issue, a new version of the client will be made that solves it.

yes it was fixed, but if they used RFC6979 in the first place, there wouldn't have been an issue

I dumped it into my local stream (I'm about 120km inland). Hopefully it gets to the ocean

it's only 12 words. I'm sure you've memorised movie quotes longer than that.

All you need to do is pay half of the loan back and then earn some more bitcoins until you can pay the other half back. Now if the person you owe bitcoins to never releases them, then you have a problem.

I make negative effort to be anonymous. I have a vanity address with my name.

it didn't break when I dropped it on my concrete floor.
@_date: 2013-09-16 01:27:57
well, I don't think I can do that now. Maybe next time.
@_date: 2013-09-16 11:01:24
bitaddress.org, paper wallet tab. print it, cut it out.

I'll give you 1 bitcoin if you can somehow crack the QR code. (No stealing the original file)

I interpreted it as meaning that unless a foreign currency was used, you need to use Australian currency.
@_date: 2013-09-25 04:02:01
yeah but then you need to guard that with your life as well
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:44:59
It could. But it probably won't

well, I folded it in half inwards. I'm not sure how uv resistant laser printing is though
