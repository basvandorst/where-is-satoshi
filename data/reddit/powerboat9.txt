But how would he delete Bitcoin?
He could crash the price by selling all of his, but it wouldn't be permanent and would be hard to do again.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:01:42
You can't easily trade time
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:05:46
Oh, yeah, that kind of time.
1:1 probably wouldn't work all the time though, as jobs have different difficulties and people have different levels of skill.
@_date: 2018-09-02 02:23:43
There has to be something that makes people who haven't adopted crypto currency yet decide to do so instead of just trading in gold or other expensive metals, or simply bringing back the gold standard.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:52:52


Probably, yeah


Not that badly. Open pit mines would be the worst, but people wouldn't have to sell their land/nature preserves to miners.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:45:44
Oh, wow. I really have a bad ego, defining value as subjective. I really need to get a handle on thinking that different people can value different things different amounts, and that how much I value something isn't necessarily how much others should value it.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:11:27
Because gold has other uses, doesn't require infrastructure to trade, and isn't vulnerable to software exploits. It's also been used before.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:59:17
That's not really an answer
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:29:15
What people decide it's worth, which is based on supply and demand and stabilized by the cost to mine more of it.
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:04:46
But people would need to maintain large amount of infrastructure to use it. In a post apocalyptic world, that would be pretty hard.
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:04:21


You mean if governments/rich people attempted to destroy Bitcoin? Yeah, people would be pretty angry. Without widespread adoption, though, not enough people would be angry enough to try communism and with hypothetical widespread adoption Bitcoin early adopters would be part of the rich. And when the rich and poor are both affected by a Bitcoin collapse, communism wouldn't be likely.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:09:40


Well, yeah. If fiat currency collapsed, people would probably jump back to tried and true methods.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:44:22


Conventional money/gold/other goods can do that too


I will give you that, automation is easier.


Conventional money/gold/other goods can do that too


...or just use Bitcoin or a stable coin dirrectly


Or they could use other services


What? Most already are proof of work. That's what Bitcoin mining is.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:48:36
Well, yeah. A trained plumber's labor fixing a sink is going to be worth much more than mine.
@_date: 2018-09-03 04:00:07
Then what would happen?
@_date: 2018-09-07 20:37:41
Probably some other more expensive metal.
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:36:02
Oh. Yeah, it would be determined by someone's id, ego, and superego interacting. If that's what you meant.


@_date: 2018-09-06 19:29:50
Is this going on r/whooosh?
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:49:45
How is that relevant?
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:02:42


But why would anyone want to accept the tokens once they've been mined? It's basically just another fiat currency but decentralized.
It also requires infrastructure and electricity to maintain crypto currency block chains, which would be hard to keep stable if fiat currency we're to collapse.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:08:19
How useful someone thinks something is, often influenced by how much value they can obtain from others using it.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:59:47
Would what be bigger?
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:36:46
But... he can't. That's sort of the point.
@_date: 2018-09-03 17:07:27
Yeah, that's what I was saying.


That too seems viable.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:49:18


@_date: 2018-09-03 03:39:23
Who's "they"? Assuming you mean rich people, that would still be increadibly difficult. The price of gold would progressively increase as rich people started buying it all. People would also find alternatives if the price was set too high, and whenever rich people tried to use the gold by selling it to poorer people, they'd have to buy it back to maintain their monopoly.
Getting all the Bitcoin would be way easier. Around 70% of Bitcoin's hashrate is controlled by Chinese mining pools, and the government could simply order them to screw with transactions through a &gt;50% attack.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:32:00


So, wait
A currency is going to destroy capitalism?
Capitalism is free trade. However, I'm guessing you mean employee/employer relationships. How would Bitcoin destroy that?
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:58:45
How? Trustless systems are pretty nice, but I don't see how that's related.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:54:53


Well yeah, mining would probably increase


Nothing much?
Are you supposed to be switching between alts, or are you just using multiple comments to address my points?
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:57:54
Mining gold on Mars would still be very expressive, moving it between earth and Mars even more so. Crypto currencies could however fill the niche need to trade between planets, however.
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:03:50
Because people want to store value for long periods of time. They don't want to have to carry around large piles of goods in a cart and complete long chains of item exchange to get specific things.
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:56:19
Well, yeah, once that happens. But not for 20-40 years.
@_date: 2018-09-02 06:08:41
Why not? Its value tends to be stable, you can store it for long periods of time, and you can physically carry a lot of value.
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:43:48
Because it would be progressively harder for them to buy more as the supply decreased, people would have to voluntarily trade away their gold, and if the rich attempted to use the gold to trade with poorer people they'd break their own monopoly and have to try to buy it back.
