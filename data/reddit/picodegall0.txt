Was the "-wow" really necessary in this title?

Lol you got me, edited*. Nonetheless, I do not see this as good news.

Astrill and many other VPN's accept bitcoin payments too which I think is great. Regarding this post however, those sites accept credit card payments too, so bitcoin does not really "solve" this problem, anybody can solve this problem with a credit card and a VPN.

While I agree that it sucks we can't choose where our taxes go to, I also have to say that if nobody paid taxes- we'd all be screwed as a country. So if you avoid paying taxes on bitcoin while others are paying the correct amount of taxes on their bitcoin gains, you are taking an entitlement for tax-free gains which isn't yours to take.

I get everyone's pointing out that the % stays the same, but I specifically said "Buying 1 BTC now cost $8.50 and Selling 1 BTC cost $8.50". Not "Buying $850 worth of BTC and Selling $850 worth of BTC". You're nit-picking really, my main point was that other exchanges have cheaper fees, AND- here's the kicker- Now that they have less risk, they should be able to afford to lower their fees! &lt;- Thats the magic point that people are not responding to.

I have to agree. This is a little immature. How is someone posting their QR-code on a subway sign in any way helping bitcoin? Its just an attempt to get donations which to me looks desperate. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:43:00
Sorry but I don't see how this is good news at all. 
1. Business accounts are not allowed to be used for Bitcoin transactions in China.
2. He removed his personal bank account as a funding option because presumably he got in trouble for it.
Huobi does a shit ton of volume... this is Not good news.

I think these attempts at getting btc donations are getting really desperate. This is vandalism and half the people walking by are just going to get confused by the new B you posted there.

I'd have to agree with you, the markets are a bit shaky and with the Gox lockout I feel many people were just waiting for something bad to happen.

"Aren't these the same scumbags, who throughout history, have been hated"..... What are you even trying to say here. If you're using historical information to talk about people, those people are probably dead.
People hate taxes, and? Also, on that point, bitcoin does not prevent taxation, which you seemed to hint at with something along the lines of "bitcoin is a big fuck you to anyone ... who puts taxes on my being". Seriously? You are not avoiding taxes by buying bitcoin, and if you are then you're the scumbag for leeching off the taxes of others

This is HUGEEEEE. Absolutely good for bitcoin, get rid of the weak hands!!!!!! (Sarcasm)
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:12:55
Yes, however many platforms are lowering there transaction fees because say I want to buy 1 BTC, it now cost $8.50 to buy and $8.50 to sell. That means the price has to go up $17 to break even on a bitcoin. If we're using it for purchases, we're paying extra in transaction costs for the same product to pay in bitcoin. Just a thought. They have less risk to insure now because of the limit decrease, I say fees should see a drop as well.
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:44:06
Whoops I stand corrected. I had been reading all the "good news" comments and I thought yours started off the same lol. Glad there are some people with sense here.

He is probably not going to sell that many albums he isn't as popular now as he used to be
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:16:02
Regardless, not even BTCchina was able to maintain a bank account for accepting deposits. Banks do not want to deal with bitcoin in China, and there's a good possibility for further regulation.

Thanks for your valuable input, I still don't know which part of my statement you're referring to since you generalized it as "statement" even though I've written several statements in this thread. No, this current comment has no source, it comes from 
@_date: 2014-01-10 15:46:18
You went from 10 BTC to 1 BTC?? Do you realize how much of an inconvenience this is? I can understand going to maybe 5 BTC or even 2, but all the way to 1? That is such a dramatic drop it it's almost sad. Since you're dropping Instant Buy limits due to the increase in BTC price, are you going to lower your fees now as well? 
-Not a happy customer
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:44:08
Yes I understand % based fees, but his last statement isn't even relevant to his argument. You wouldn't have to go up $17 back in the day, you'd have to go up 2% of whatever the price was back then which would be $1 in his argument so that comparison doesn't even reflect his point, regardless he says it's easier for it to go up $17 now than it was back in the day.. but his whole argument is that it's all % changes, in reality he's suggesting it's easier to go up 2% today than it was back then. Which is not necessarily true. You are just tip happy my friend.

Oh believe me, I am losing faith in the system. But I do believe people have a moral obligation to contribute as others contribute. The system is screwed, we'll soon all suffer for it, but many people have the attitude that their actions don't affect others and that they're entitled to pass on what's due of them. I was speaking more towards how that attitude is detrimental towards a society's growth 
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:46:33
Did you even read the end half of my comment? "They have less risk to insure now, so I don't see why fees can't be lower like other exchanges are at .5%"
Not to mention the fact we pay 1% for the right to pay in bitcoin. It was just a suggestion, for some reason you felt necessary to go try to educate people on %-change when that is common sense. 
Also seeing how your whole argument was "it's all relevant in percentages" I don't see why you would include that going up $17 when the price was $20, an 85% increase, is comparable to now when it would be a 2% increase. Not relevant to the rest of your comment.

Do I need to source BTCchina not accepting bank account deposits because of China's regulations? I thought that was common knowledge in this subreddit. Your reply adds nothing to the conversation
@_date: 2014-01-26 01:38:32
No, as in why is there a "B" train on this track now. Not everyone knows the bitcoin logo
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:37:29
This is just your interpretation of his actions. There is no proof that it is now safe to use a business account. He could have just kept using his personal one. Something is up. If it was safe to use a business account, BTCchina would appropriately be using one now as well, which they aren't.

Well Vault of Satoshi has .5% now and also does ACH. Coinbase charges $.15 for bank transfers so even though that's nothing, it's not a part of their 1% fee

Who gives a shit? It's bitcoin! To most people- "virtual" and "digital" are synonymous. Nobody cares about the damn dictionary definition anymore and the average customer will not bat an eyelash at them using Virtual

Until I see some real proof from google, this could easily be a hoax
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:45:17
I didn't write anything about bitcoin exchanges being illegal or bitcoin itself being illegal for citizens to obtain. The main issue here is that exchanges like BTCchina *lost* their ability to accept deposits from bank accounts even though China's ruling doesn't explicitly say banks can't deposit to exchanges. Chinese culture is a little different, they're more conservative with their actions when it comes to not trying to piss off the government.
TL;DR: Though not explicitly stated, Chinese banks are avoiding transacting with exchanges. Huobi is now doing something that BTCchina is not capable of doing (accepting deposits with a business account), so it follows that they may soon lose this ability as well

"What would you like a source to?"-picodegall0
Edit*: Also I'm curious what your opinion is on Huobi removing transfers to its personal account since that is the topic for this thread.

Many assets are still not protected from inflation even for "the rich". Anyhow, "the poor" don't invest at all, so that's no argument

He means most of your cash from paychecks goes straight to investments after paying expenses, rather than sitting in cash doing nothing. In investments cash grows, whereas in your checking account it does nothing

This post is misleading. The way these graphs are made looks fishy. Really have to provide underlying data.. there's no way of knowing that first graph is really 4 years of data, and I also don't think going by daily candle size vs price is a good way of representing volatility.
In short, I do not believe there is a linear relationship between BTC price and daily candle size.

The axis labels have nothing to do with it being 4 years of data. I just highly doubt this is linear.
