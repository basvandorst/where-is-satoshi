Nice, for some reason I never thought of this as a reason for not hashing on the client side. I've never implemented a login that doesn't hash server-side, but now I know for sure why I shouldn't. Thanks!

Economically, sure, but what I think OP is trying to solve is the seemingly worthless computations an incredibly powerful network of computers is performing. But Ruzihm raises some pretty valid points as well, and I wouldn't say the computations are completely worthless based on his response.

Could we perhaps request a less ink-intensive version for those who don't want to cripple the beautiful blue? Blue on white, maybe?

I said this in another thread that got buried:


Notice how their navigation places "Send/Request" before "Buy/Sell"? This is an obvious design decision to emphasize Bitcoin as a currency rather than Bitcoin as a commodity.
The trouble is that so many people (myself included) find Coinbase to be the easiest way to turn USD into coins, so they're flocking to Coinbase right now.

Sure, but what's the point of Bitcoin then?

Just curious, but how quickly did your calculations run? I'm trying to get started with blockparser, and it's extremely slow with the huge blockchain, even running just the `simpleStats` command. Not sure if that's normal.

Do you do anything to limit your requests per second?
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:15:08
Haha, as did I. I'll keep you posted on how the blockparser program works out for me. It seems to cover my needs pretty well, but it also looks like it will take longer to run the calculations.

The answer is yes, you can send your coins to any wallet. [Here's what that process looks like.](
I know there's a lot of Mt. Gox hate around here, but buying through Coinbase to get to Mt. Gox or any other exchange isn't such a bad idea. Particularly since, in my experience, Coinbase is the easiest way to turn your USD into coins fairly quickly. Mt. Gox tends to have higher prices than other exchanges so it seems ripe for arbitrage (the process of buying low at one market and selling high at another). Since it's quite easy to move your coins between wallets instantly, the hassle becomes moving your fiat (USD/etc.) between the markets.
A lot of folks are misinterpreting Coinbase and panicking when the price moves around as if it's built to be an exchange. Coinbase moves in slow motion. It's building a real, accessible product around Bitcoin that the average joe can use for real things like paying for coffee or sending money between friends. It's not here for the fast-paced, big-city-banker-style transactions that a lot of people are trying to use it for right now.
Hope this helps! I've been researching this for a bit as well, so let me know if I should clarify/correct anything.

Just checked... nope :(

I'll shamefully admit I came in as one of them. Now that I'm holding onto my coins though, I think I'd rather use them as an actual alternative currency rather than just a commodity. There's a cafe nearby that accepts BTC, so I figure I got myself a ~$100 gift card there.

This looks like exactly the sort of thing I need. Thanks!
