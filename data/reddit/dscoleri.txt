You can't sit there and say that past is no indicator of the future when the entire point of your comment was "hey look at what it did back in 2013" If you believe that past is no indicator then why even make your comment about past performance. You can't say that when I mention it went up 1500% but at the same time use it as reasoning for the price to stagnate for 3 years. Either both of our observations are pointless or both of them are valid.
I almost never post in this sub. I have no agenda that I'm trying to push and I'm not even saying I think it will go up 3 years from now. You are trying to say I am being biased, I'm not making any predictions or telling people they should hold etc. I am just saying that cherry picking data is not helping anyone. I have absolutely no issue with someone predicting a price drop or stagnation in price, I actually think that is pretty likely. I have an issue when you misrepresent data, or cherry pick to support that.
Let me try to phrase this another way. I go to get a physical and tell my doctor that I gained 5 lbs. When he weighs me it turns out I gained 25. The doctor ask me why I told him I gained 5lbs when that was clearly not true and my response is that I DID gain 5lbs, i just didn't mention that I also gained an additional 20. This is absolutely 100% no different then what you just did. Yes, you are right, it took 3 years to reach the same level which it then proceeded to absolutely shatter. You can tell whatever story you want when you take facts out of context. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:18:06
That's kind of disingenuous. It was like 1,200 in 2013 but it reached 19,000 in 2017. That is almost a 1500% increase. So by your logic I can hold 3 years and go from 10k to  160k. Sounds pretty good to me.
I'm not saying past dictates future, because it doesn't. I'm just saying that you are trying to frame this in a misleading way. Saying it took 3 years to reach back to the same level is only a half truth because it did much more than get back to the same level.

You don't buy it because you are an alt for the OP
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:10:39
You would still need me to enter my pin number and besides, as target has shown, it is WAY more secure than traditional CC stripes.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:54:44
dude, shut the fuck up. I checked, this is just an alt account for the op. I wonder how many other alt accounts you have in this thread. Stop being a dick, you withdrew the coins after they accidentally put them in your account, that's why you were charged, end of story.
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:45:42
Hey so wait, are you saying that when they put the 20 BTC in your account you left it there and did not withdraw it? I haven't seen you answer this directly.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:00:49
If someone uses the same password for multiple sites and used their Kickstarter password on a bitcoin exchange or something (which is a really bad idea) then it would be a good idea to change that password.
@_date: 2014-01-28 15:57:14
Don't worry about it. I just sent you a bit more, just glad to help out :)
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:58:35
Also it looks from your post history like you may have had a problem with coinbase. I am completely not saying coinbase is Gods gift to bitcoin. I understand that problems happen and I am sure some people have been boned by them. But in THIS particular thread it was pretty clear that the OP was trying to take advantage of an error. He contradicted himself multiple times in here, and he was posting with multiple alts.
Personally I have never had a problem with them, and I really hope I never do, but I know that shit happens and I'm not saying that everyone that complains about Coinbase is full of it.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:50:18
Hey, you are a fucking asshole. You have been posting all over this thready defending the OP and posing shit about coinbase and I just went through your comment history and you are absolutely 100% an alt account for the OP. You are a liar and at this point I am convinced you are trying to squeeze coinbase because you tried to take off with the coins after they made a mistake.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:35:17
It's not a big deal. It's not THAT old, I guess I got a little carried away. Anyway I realized after reading your recent posts that you probably weren't one of his alts.
The poster in this thread had a slightly different story. Basically Coinbase deposited 20 btc in his account accidentally. He claims he never removed the coins and they charged him for them. In reality I think he got greedy and when he saw that they made an error he withdrew the coins. I think this because although he insisted that he left the coins in his account he said in other posts that he would gladly return the coins to them if thats what he needed to do. It was also a red flag when he started posting with alt accounts saying that he had the same thing happen. I have never accused anyone on reddit of being an alt before but I got suspicious when I noticed they were using some of the same language and when I checked into the profiles I saw some things that made it 100% evident that they were alts. Anyway, if the coinbase system screws up like that it is programmed to recall the bitcoins first and if they are not available it will charge the bank account then. So by removing the coins that were deposited in error the poster made the whole situation worse. In the end it was still a screw up on Coinbase's end but the OP tried to take advantage and made his situation way worse.
Was your issue with Coinbase ever resolved? This worries me because I use coinbase and I have it linked to my bank account. I use 2FA but I have been hearing a lot of horror stories lately. I was gonna ask if Coinbase took care of you in the end but I read the second post you made a couple days ago and it doesn't look like they did. Well... I mean you didn't lose any money but they didn't leave you feeling warm and fuzzy either. I'm considering opening a second bank account that I will keep mostly empty just to link to coinbase, this way if something goofy happens my actual bank account wont get drained. It kind of sucks that we have to go through this but like you said in one of your posts, they kinda have a monopoly on convenience.
Anyway, good luck in the future, just be glad you didn't actually lose any money, and welcome to the community :)
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:47:41
Yea I guess we just don't agree on that. I just see him withdrawing the bitcoins as "accepting" the merchandise, in which case he deserved to be charged. It doesn't matter anyway because he is saying he didn't withdraw them. So if he is telling the truth we both agree that he definitely shouldn't have been charged.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:28:29
I think that BTC is much better than google wallet but I have to disagree with your point about Google Wallet being an online option only. Right now I can use my Google Wallet at WAY more brick and mortar locations than BTC. I have an android phone with nfc built in. So I can use my Google Wallet anyplace that has those nfc credit card scanners at the register. I regularly use it to buy gas.
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:50:12
I'm getting the vibe that this dude saw 20btc in his account and withdrew it immediately. Then coinbase saw the error and tried to recall the btc but couldn't so they charged his account. Yes, coinbase fucked up in the first place but it seems like this guy tried to take advantage of the situation and the current mess is a result of him being greedy/dishonest.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:44:13
actually I did not know that, interesting.
@_date: 2014-01-30 04:59:47
There is one fact that I am confused about and it seems you are avoiding answering it directly. When they deposited the 20 BTC in your account and you noticed it was there by mistake did you withdraw the BTC?
@_date: 2014-03-17 22:59:49
Niantic Labs is an internal Google startup. Just wanted to clear that up. Also I know it isn't impossible to fix these issues, but I think the fact that a google owned startup is struggling with this is not a good sign. 
Having said that, this would be awesome if they could pull it off.
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:09:34
DUDE!!! What a fucking hypocrite. I can't speak on the validity of the livnxxl account but YOU ARE 100% an alt account for the OP, get lost.
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:58:14
Sorry I didn't see it earlier, you should definitely make that clear in the main post. It's a huge point. It can easily look like you tried to take advantage of the situation by withdrawing the btc
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:43:48
lol yea pretty much, but like everything it is a trade off. My google wallet may be much easier to hack but i can always reverse the charges if I need to. My bitcoin account will be MUCH MUCH harder to get into (as long as I am not an idiot) BUT if someone manages, my bitcoins are gone.
So yes... bitcoin has the *potential* to be more secure, as long as you are taking those steps.
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:34:34
what do you need? $3 in BTC?
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:32:10
Well if he withdrew the coins it would have just contributed the current mess, but you are right none of that matters because he is offering to give them back now. The issue now is that there is a coinbase rep here trying to help him but he refuses to give the rep his case number saying that he wants to talk to his lawyer first. I don't know about you but if I was in this mess I would just want to have the problem fixed. Coinbase fucked up but now it seems like he is making this more difficult then it needs to be, just give the rep the case number and get the problem fixed.
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:36:22
I think the issue is that, yes, they are admitting they fucked up but they are also saying they want to fix the problem, they just need the case number. ALSO, earlier he wasn't clear about whether or not he withdrew the BTC, I think it is totally reasonable for coinbase to try to charge for it if he withdrew the btc. He has since said that he did not withdraw the coins but if he did then the resulting mess is just as much his fault.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:52:37
Dude, they are alts, believe me I combed through the profiles. I would explain to you exactly how I know they are alts but you have been a redditor for 8 days and almost all of your posts are in coinbase threads so I'm not entirely convinced that you aren't an alt as well. I'm not accusing you, just saying it looks pretty suspicious, especially since you dug up this old thread to reply to me.
Go ahead and look through my reddit history, I have nothing to hide. I have been a redditor for like 4 years. I have only been active in for the past few months and I have only ever even mentioned Coinbase in this one thread.
EDIT: Actually I'm now convinced that you aren't an alt simply because you weren't being a complete douchebag when someone suggested that you contact @_date: 2014-01-28 07:36:04
Also out of curiosity, how much do you need before you can withdraw from bter... I have some money on that exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:12:12
Yes I read the post, no needed to be an asshole about it. At the time the op was not being direct about whether or not he withdrew the coins after they showed up in his account. If he did then coinbase would be well within their rights to charge his account. He has since stated that he did NOT withdraw the coins so I do agree that coinbase was in the wrong. The only point I was originally trying to make was that if he DID take the coins then he was partially at fault, and I still stand by that statement.
@_date: 2014-01-31 07:58:15
Also, he is posting all kinds a defamatory things in this thread using alt accounts. I actually believed him at first but once I saw the other posts he was making with a second account I realized he is just a liar. I am sure he took the coins, knowing they weren't his and is now mad that he got charged. In addition he keeps contradicting himself. He says at one point he would be glad to return the coins if they would give him a way but then he insists that he never withdrew them.
TLDR: OP is a lying scumbag
@_date: 2014-01-31 08:17:18
Holy shit dude, seriously, ANOTHER ALT?! Im starting to think this entire thread is me having conversations with the same person.
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:12:13
Got ya, in that sense you are totally right. Also just to clarify, I think BTC is superior to the google wallet for a bunch of reasons. I just can't wait for there to be more physical stores accepting it.
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:56:43
Ok got ya, so right now you basically have the 20btc you originally tried to sell and the 20 that they gave you by accident in your coinbase account and they are still trying to collect usd.

And by "game company" you mean Google. If Google can't get around this issue I doubt a small kickstarter will be able to stop rampant cheating, especially since there is much more incentive to cheat when money is involved.

I get that consumers have rights but if amazon sends you something that you did not order you would have to return it. You refuse, you don't just get to keep it. If you refused to return it I can guarantee that they will charge you. Why should this be any different.
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:20:28
OK so playing devils advocate... Why is this good for bitcoin? What happens if the Fed creates its own cryptocurrency and that becomes the "official" US cryptocurrency and then bitcoin is classified as an illegal currency. Just because these central banks are investigating the technology does not mean they will embrace bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2017-01-24 04:06:49
Sorry if I came off as skeptical. I was actually really hopping someone would counter with a good reason why I'm wrong. As I already said I'm actually bullish on bitcoin and I don't think this scenario is likely in the near future. Having said that, your argument is flawed because while I agree that the government would not be able to stop bitcoin transactions, they would be able to do possibly irreparable damage to bitcoins utility as a currency. I think you are right in that bitcoin transactions would be just as difficult to prevent as piracy is now. The problem is that by banning bitcoin exchanges and US based banks and merchants from accepting the currency they will completely cripple its growth and neuter its value. Obviously the technically savvy could still find ways of using it, but when no vendors accept it anymore, and you cant easily exchange it for goods and services it will severely impact the long term viability of bitcoin. I guess my point is, they don't NEED to completely stop it at a technical level. They just need to hurt it enough.
One other thing, piracy hasn't been stopped after numerous efforts, you are right about that. The pirated content has inherent value. If I pirate a movie I can watch that movie and enjoy it. They can make the movie more difficult to pirate but if I jump through those extra hoops I can still enjoy the movie. The same can't be said for bitcoin. We may be looking at a scenario where we have to take ever more complicated steps to purchase and transact in bitcoin while simultaneously that same bitcoin is less and less valuable because its uses are shrinking.
Anyway, I don't think we are going to have this problem for a while. I also think that if we do face this problem it is because bitcoin becomes a threat to the dollar (which would be amazing), but it is a possibility.
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:17:57
I know this is a joke, but this image does sum up the mentality around here. I'm as bullish as they get on bitcoin but I never understood this mentality. Lets say the US bans bitcoin and a bunch of other countries follow suit. I fully understand that the government can't physically stop people from using it. There will always be a way to transact on your own directly with others etc. However, if the government prohibits banks and businesses from doing business with bitcoin, that seems like it would be catastrophic. Obviously people like us would still be able to transact directly with each other, and you could always trade in person for fiat, but that is not a sustainable model.  They don't need the whole fence. They just need to stop the banks and the bulk of businesses from using it. If they do that then won't bitcoin just atrophy and die. I've brought this up before and no one has been able to give me a good reason why this is wrong. The fence isn't intended to stop people from getting through completely, it is intended to stifle growth of a technology/financial tool still in its infancy.

The bull run started before his speech. I was definitely surprised by how candid he was when he spoke but I think it's effect on price was probably negligible. There is a lot of other stuff happening right now that could be impacting price, but who knows.

You claim below that you are trying to make the community look less like Puritans on a witchhunt, but all you are doing is making the community look like a bunch of pretentious assholes. The OP that you were responding to said *"I think..."* He is expressing his own opinion. He never claimed to have intimate knowledge of what is happening at BFL, he never said he had inside information, he never said he knew what was going on over there. Get off your high horse, he doesn't need a source to have an opinion.

Yea but is there any malware around that is smart enough to know how to do that. I mean, we are talking about something that would be able to infect a windows machine, then recognize and gain access to a virtual machine that will be encrypted when not in use. Even if it waits for me to use the VM it still needs to then be able to pull the private key out of whatever linux distro I am running in the VM. So to summarize it needs to be a windows based virus that can interface with linux running on a vm. I know that from a technical standpoint this is possible but from a practical standpoint this seems highly unlikely unless I am severely out of the loop when it comes to modern virus technology. I mean, I probably would use this as a savings account but it seems more than enough for my "spending wallet"
