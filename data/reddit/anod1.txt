It's very soon then... 
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:16:57
OK, that would be great. Thank you. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 07:29:17
a lower block reward while result in a lower transaction fee, because miners while need the transaction fee. The difficulty could decrease in the meantime.

Anyone can replace the qr code with is own address in order to get tips. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 22:16:14
They will from 08/30 to 09/01
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:25:44
Do you know if it accept Bitcoin via the android app ? It would be very cool, but I can't try (unless I actually pay for a room... )
@_date: 2014-10-02 06:23:34
you don't get how a market work. You can't sell "at the value you raised it to" if there are no buyers. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:57:53
You can do that with the blockchain. Just make a transaction to yourself with a time lock, then erase the private key of your first wallet. This said, I don't think there is an easy way to do this yet. 
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:26:52
Huobi actually have zero trade fee. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 10:53:25
direct link to all the explanation :

Bitstamp +3% seems very reasonable.

Or maybe he doesn't use a Mac.

Coinbase, circle...

@_date: 2014-07-16 11:50:30
Ho yes you're right. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:12:35
This is just a test and work only in Finland. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:33:36
Very small amount of Bitcoin. (Here : 3 satoshi) 
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:34:12
Why is it better ? Just in order to diversify the network ?
@_date: 2014-07-11 20:32:15


unless you add others coins later, on the same adress. 
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:54:43
At the checkout ? But it's not the hotel which accept bitcoin, it's the app. (Destinia) The hotel doesn't even know that you paid with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 07:14:06
And you can get flight with Expedia... 
@_date: 2014-10-02 05:31:29
I don't know why this is downvoted, it actually works. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 12:24:02
Yes, that's what I thought. Not this easy... 
@_date: 2014-03-01 23:13:36
But you have to trust someone that the bitcoins are actually on the paper wallet. So it can't be used as a bill. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:48:34
I have just installed it and it looks very good. I will use it ! 
Maybe next step will be to make it available from a computer, but it will need to make an account in order to synchronize. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 10:49:33
you can't make payments, but only receive them. But in area where mobile data is expensive, you can make payment by sending transactions via internet, and save a lot of money because you download the blockchain via this app. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 12:01:38
Actually, they are increasing a million fold. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:28:44
You can buy bitcoins with a credit card.
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:23:09
@_date: 2014-10-02 05:25:39
You can't make money like this, because when you sell the next day, the price will go down as much as it has raised. Unless other react to the jump by also buying. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 11:49:08
TL;DR : everybody should accept Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:58:25


it's easy to prove that you have bitcoins, but i can't see any way to prove that you don't own bitcoin.

I'm currently 70 km away from aubenas. I could see the police, but I don't know if they are going to care about this story... (Especially because I'm not the victim)
@_date: 2014-07-26 07:21:14
That's why a lower block reward while result in a lower transaction fee, unlike most people think. 
@_date: 2014-09-10 22:01:16
" Fine, I'm gonna make my own currency ! With blackjack and hookers..." Satoshi 
@_date: 2014-07-14 20:40:00


How ? How the money is created is complicated, I haven't understood this yet. (How Bitcoin are created seems simple to me. ) 
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:57:38
If I scan a qr code twice, does it send twice as much as the other outputs ? It would be cool, because I can like several blog post from the same person in a month. (For example)
Also you should consider adding a public message in the blockchain : "send via supporttr". 
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:32:09
Yes they do.
@_date: 2014-07-01 18:24:18
They are jealous of the early adopters. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 22:55:43
I think it's the same app, just this one is on f-droid. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 09:58:26
A good thing would be to make only one transaction each month (with a lot of outputs) in order to lower the fee. Maybe it's already how it works... 
@_date: 2014-12-18 07:08:41
He is not a changetip employee. Here is his account on google+  
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:03:52
There is a need to have a lot of people with some debt, when the money is made of debt (fiat). 
It's absolutely not the same thing with Bitcoin. When people save money (Bitcoin), it mean the value of all the Bitcoin go up, so other people can buy more. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:39:11
There should be a bot who post this!
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:41:41
An other solution would be to increase the block size, in order to have a high number of low fee. (So, yes, it's not true)
@_date: 2015-07-28 18:11:32
Shh ! It's private ! 
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:06:54
I'm pretty sure Google pays twitter in order to index their content.

I heared that the ban on deposit take effect on chinese new year, so maybe it's just temporary. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:07:37
But you store it with constant hope that it could gain value. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:56:56
this is not true. You can send another transaction with a higher transaction fee and hope the other transaction while be incorporated in the next block. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:35:35
It was still in beta, you had to ask and wait for some activation. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:03:46
It's a logarithmique chart. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:26:41
We are all slaves then. (Unless you own bitcoin) 
@_date: 2013-04-01 20:38:35
An update on the site just said the money is safe. The should be back in 48h. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:25:52
Just to be sure : I think this is not a problem if you use a paper wallet made with armory or electrum. Is it true? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:11:12
and for those who think that the price is growing to fast, that is how fast startups grow. ( [or even faster]( ) 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:19:16
Si hopefully the lawyers are more comfortable with it now. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 15:37:50
if you think it give the tipee's 21,000,000 bitcoins, then no it doesn't. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 12:03:34
You can use 9flats.com anywhere in the world.

Actually, Millibitcoins are silver to bitcoin gold.

@_date: 2013-11-11 21:13:32
It looks like pizza.fr also accept bitcoin payment ! 
@_date: 2013-05-01 10:31:13
Ho stop it, you !  
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:40:36
I strongly recommend bitstamp.

I'm French, and the hotel for my honeymoon is just a few blocks from this bar. 
I will try this bar, and I won't pay the fee for converting my euros in dollars. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:25:29
Wow, awesome ! It's the true power of bitcoin to totally skip the fiat. 
I will definitely use this when it's done.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:36:14
You can buy 0.1 Bitcoin if you want.

He had $150 in one address, the software send $0.5 to subway and $149.5 to another address he own. It's called the change, and it increases anonymity.

Very good, thank you! 
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:48:00
Buy more Bitcoins, then use them. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 22:04:49
Good timing I guess... 
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:58:10
I don't think you should advice to mine bitcoins, as it's not easy for the average person. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 20:19:35
Bitstamp.net look way more professional than MtGox, and it's easier to use. Very good site. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:55:30
Are you aware that you can buy a fraction of a bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:52:31
Thank you very much, I will definitely use it. 
@_date: 2013-03-12 19:31:10
Maybe silly, but I had to check the price of Bitcoin after reading this. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 13:54:05
Actually, every two weeks, there is an adjustment, the difficulty change in order to have a new block found every 10 minutes in average. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:01:04
Good news, but it's actually only half the way. They should allow people to accept bitcoin for the rent of their flats, instead of converting everything in fiat. 
@_date: 2013-03-26 12:54:23
Mtgox is like Bitcoin-qt : a trap for new users. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:56:03
good point ! 
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:20:37
I'm French, and I will travel to the USA for my Honeymoon. Maybe this will allow me to avoid changing my euros into dollars. I don't know if the fee are expensive... 
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:06:26
The problem is : he can't find a payment processor because it's forbidden for them to work with bitcoin companies. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:39:50
Will it air on a Chinese station as well ? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 07:23:29
Yes they are trustworthy. They must ask for your id by law.

There is no such thing as bad publicity. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:12:16
Because fuck you, that's why. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 15:10:32
More people mining it doesn't mean more bitcoin being created. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:14:05
You can find a link with the world 比特币 (bitcoin) on the main page. Just search for it (ctrl+f). 
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:08:50
Paper wallet can have more than one address (deterministic wallet) 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:07:42
Maybe you should write 250 millibitcoins instead of 0.25 bitcoin. It sound much more valuable, especially for newbies. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:56:29
they can't, they are naked ! 
@_date: 2013-03-23 17:59:12
Je suis aussi français, je répond en français car j'arrive à lire l'anglais mais pour écrire c'est plus dur.
J'ai testé plusieurs bureaux de change virtuels : mtgox, Bitcoin-central, et bitstamp.net. 
Je préfère largement bitstamp au deux autres. Pas besoin de vérification, et comme les euros sont immédiatement convertis en dollars (sans frais), il y a suffisamment de liquidités. 
J'ai écrit un article sur l'utilisation de bitstamp. 
J'ai d'ailleurs le projet de faire un site francophone d'actualité et d'aide sur le Bitcoin, malheureusement projet un peu en pause du fait d'un manque de temps. Es ce que certains francophone seraient partant pour m'aider, es ce que vous pensez que c'est une bonne idée? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:16:24

Simple solution : buy mor coins. (Sure, you need to have money...)
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:31:34
They sold bitcoins before the money reaches them, so it make sense that they can't send the money in a few hours. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:31:21
I will buy a Sim card from the USA, but you're right, maybe it won't work. Will see...

Do what he said just before he said it. (Yes, it's pretty hard)
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:43:37
I think it's actually true. (It was $266 on mtgox) 
@_date: 2013-09-02 21:51:44

This is not a transaction, this is a block. That why it's a squared bubble. It means that's the 3000 btc is the amount for all the transactions for the last 10 minutes.
