The info about gift cards is all over and confusing to a first time user. Just to confirm, I can use Amazon.com gift card to ship internationally?

I'm visiting Thailand and Amazon would ship here, I need to deposit 7% for VAT and the shipping company would do the import and deliver it directly to my place.
For some reason they refused my credit card and here the laptop costs twice as much.

Why is everyone panicking? Bitcoin is almost 11 years old and these swings are normal. I’ve been here since -11 and seen it all. Relax and keep on stacking. Be grateful you’re in so early you can get them cheap.

More and more fiat representing the same amount of goods and services. How do you think the prices of everything won’t go up?

Bitcoin is a binary bet. Either it will go to $0 or infinity replacing every other money. I’ve been studying money and finance full time since I found out about Bitcoin and haven’t figured out a way to kill.
After next halfing Bitcoin’s stock to flow ratio will surpass gold’s and will become the hardest money in history. It’s inevitable Bitcoin will overtake other monies.
So relax and keep on stacking.
