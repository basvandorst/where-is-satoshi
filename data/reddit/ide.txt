If we agree that he would certainly sign a message for proof given he had the key, and he doesn't, he must not be in possession of the key. Of course if you reject the premise, that he would sign it, the argument doesn't work, but it's valid none the less.
Maybe I should have just dug up this right from the start:
edit: Do you want to expand on that example? I don't see what it has to do with modus tollens

The argument is known as modus tollens and is mathematically valid.
S = "he wants to prove he is satoshi/has satoshi's key" , P = "he proves it by signing a new message"
If S then P. Not P. Hence not S.

You think highschool level math makes one sound smart? I really want to hear which part of my post was "improper".

Cryptocurrency isn't one big entity. Bitcoin will form its value based on its utility and stability, whether another Xcoin exists along side it does not undermine these factors. Just as the price of USD isn't undermined by excessive amounts of  Zimbabwe dollars.

I don't see how taxation traits are relevant to the global market value of USD.


They are still not the same currency, and inflation is a phenomenon that applies to a currency. You can't pay with litecoins in every establishment that accepts bitcoins, and litecoins and bitcoins aren't interchangeable in exchanges. There is no way for litecoins to affect prices of bitcoins, as the value of bitcoin is based on the mechanics of bitcoin, the trust in *bitcoin* and the utility of *bitcoin*, and in no way cryptocurrency in general.
It's not like an online store will suddenly stop supporting Bitcoin as a payment option if another similar cryptocurrency appears on the market.
