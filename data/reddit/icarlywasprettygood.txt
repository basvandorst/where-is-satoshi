Unfortunately there is no correct answer, I think Bitcoin will continue to rise but with any rise there is gonna be periodic dips. If you're the type of person who will panic and sell during those dips then probably don't go all in.

Can you back this up in any way lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:37:25
You should've, it's currently dumping. And I don't see how it contradicts itself but I did write it in haste so I probably didn't articulate it as well as I should have.

Very true. Hit the nail on the head. This event is a weak handed traders worst nightmare and in the next couple of days we’ll see which coin really has the support of the community

Once the fork is over you will have both your original bitcoin and an equivalent amount of another coin called bitcoin2x
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:28:09
Agreed! Do the opposite of what people are worried about

Bout tree fiddy

Yes and I don’t remember. If it was much cheaper I’d have remembered.
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:01:03
 use the recommended wallets off this or if you want the easier route transfer your bitcoins to your coinbase wallet, they will give you your 2x after the fork. But be aware you need to do this more than 24 before the fork starts because coinbase is locking bitcoin transfers 24hours before the fork
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:20:01
Because the majority of us do not support these forks however we do support free money 
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:26:48
Yes I used it a few months ago only once but there was no issues 
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:57:18
Great explanation 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:37:20
Because it's a currency which has value and all currencies are compared against others. Pretty basic stuff

Congratulations mate you are living the dream!

Good idea since you’re only young you can afford to take more risks. However I’d leave it at 60% no matter who you are you need to remember the importance of fiat savings

Hands down the worst meme to ever be posted on this sub and that’s really saying something
