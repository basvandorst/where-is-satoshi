This is exactly my problem. Like an idiot I bought small quantities on 4 different exchanges and now can't port them to an offline wallet to hold.

Zebpay, I believe, was the first in this space. But I dislike them for various reasons. They require the user to send the money from their bank account to Zebpay's bank account. Then open a request with the transaction id in it. Then they (manually?) confirm that they received the money. This process can take well over a day in some cases.
Another thing for which I absolutely hate them is that they charge people for withdrawing their own bitcoin to their private wallet. [Here]( you can see that they say that the fee charged is "dynamic" because of the network traffic but in reality, they charge 0.001 bitcoins for any withdrawal above 0.05 bitcoins (says right there in their app). Of course, you can then check what fee they actually paid and in my case, it was 10 times less than what they took. Also, the transactions are usually batched so they end up paying much less than what they charge.
They do this to discourage people from withdrawing their funds from the exchange. But with an exchange in India losing all its BTC in an inside job, the user would be better off just withdrawing from Zebpay and moving to some other exchange (coinome comes to mind..has better fiat transfer and charges user for BTC withdrawals what they actually paid the network)

I could be wrong but babies are capable of doing both simultaneously

Okay, I have a question. How can I get a segwit address as a paper wallet for cold storage?

There are network fees. Coinbase doesn't earn from that fee.

Hey no offence but comment like yours don't actually add anything to the discussion. New people are joining everyday and they have no clue what this deal is all about. And when one party says the other is wrong then they should provide their reasons as well. Else yhe sub just comes across as an echo chamber.

And wouldn't it also mean free money for us when we dump the altcoin and our chain wins? Not suggesting it's easy to tell who'd win though.

Yes it does help! Thank you very much!

I keep seeing this advice repeated everywhere but how is this supposed to be executed? The different exchanges that I've used all put in their own fee and it's always much higher than what I see on this sub.

Does that mean Ether too is a deflationary currency? I was under the impression that Ether's supply wasn't capped.

Wtf is your comment even? It literally means nothing to any of us here. Why not explain or link us to someplace relevant. I'm new here and all everyone does here is just call out people for just being wrong without any further explanation. Sick of this bullshit.

Thanks for making me feel better.

Bummer! Have to buy high it seems.

Right after the 2x fork, it's supposed to crash again, right? Been waiting to buy ever since I missed the last big drop a month ago.
