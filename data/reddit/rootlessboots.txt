Hmm haven’t dipped into the world of these other alts yet. I was thinking XRP.. heard it’s going into Coinbase.

Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:05:11
Lol according to this, a week ago was always the time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:36:23

Yep. Fucking me over hard right now by not allowing me to purchase anything at all. 
Guess I don’t have the golden ticket Coinbase is giving out to big players. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:30:58
Whatcha mean? People do it all the time—buying on red days. Although haven’t seen bitcoin in a red day in awhile..!
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:39:40
Thanks for clarifying!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:07
That's the way to do it, and the way I've been doing it. Dolla cost average it.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:50
Haha man, that would be amazing if bitcoin crashed 80%. Only because I know it would be temporary, going off of past experiences. I have to doubt it would dip THAT much, though...
Yeah, learning the ways of the HODL has been difficult for me. 2011 had 29 bitcoins, I thank MT Gox for no lambo. 
Lately I’ve been distraught by emotion during the bitcoin bull run and lost potential gains in litecoin, so I’m prepared to HOD fucking L and quick trying to day trade long term investments. I’m determined to get good at this. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:00:04
Does anyone mind explaining to me how buy and sell limits work, Why they are great, and what is a situation that it would be great to have these buy and sell limits?
I don’t want to miss out by not using these tools.

Go sign up for Gemini. Save yourself headache, Coinbase has heavy fees and will hurt you emotionally 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:16:51
Always dips a bit in the mornin’, I’m hoping for a 3-7k drop in BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:22:37
So Gemini is pretty sweet?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:37:12
Hope you learned your lesson

Thanks a lot bud. ��

It’s seriously hard now bro. There are fucking farms in China already on this. Mine something smaller!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:37:58
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:26:23
I had heard that everyone lost everything they had on mtgox during the crash, so I gave up when I heard that to save myself false hope. If you think it’s possible that they are going to get me 400 bitcoins in today’s current price point, maybe I should look into it! I’m not gonna get all excited about it though. I highly doubt they will do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:31:11
Yep go ahead. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:38:36
Saaame. Bad feels. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:20:06
Hey everyone I’m about to enter the bitcoin hodl community. Most I’ll be able to afford right now is 1/20 of a coin, so my timing needs to be precise. 
Should I wait for the wall to collapse and then buy the dip? Assuming there will be a dip.. or should i just but now? I’m a bit new in the ways of crypto trading. ��
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:49:58
My reasoning is because last time it hit 19k it dipped. But on the other than, when we hit 10k it just kept going up and up and up
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:34:24
“Dad, can I have 1 bitcoin for Christmas?”
“What?? $7,836????  $14,037 is a lot of money! What could you possibly do with $18,847?!”
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:29
What i mean is, bitcoin always bounces back and increases in price tremendously. Why should this correction be any different from past corrections?
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:31:06
Eh, who cares, bitcoin by 2020 when I graduate will no doubt be in the hundreds of thousands. I’ll go in. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:05:47
The only thing I have to be worried about is how the ISP’s are going to treat bitcoin/litecoin/crypto websites and trading platforms. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:23
We can speculate on the past! Look at bitcoin's past. Everyone and their mother knows if bitcoin is low, it's the time to buy. Especially whales.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:02
Same here asteif, same here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:28:55
How do you mean? 
LTC and ETH both follow trends that bitcoin presents, doesn’t mean they aren’t separate. Especially because litecoin’s future potential could mean a higher % of gain considering I don’t have tens of thousands to put into BTC ya feel?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:50:51


I wouldn't be so fast to think that this is going to work the same way. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:29:36
Trust me dude I did the same thing. Ultimate lesson is so simple yet hard to be diligent in. HODL. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:45:34
The auto panic sell button? Good on that ;)
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:49:16
Can confirm. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:08:21
They should be able to. They know how many active accounts they have, being the biggest exchange in a booming market, they need to get their shit together.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:21:47
Well, yeah, adoption is happening and crypto is prospering. This doesn’t necessarily mean a temporary doomsday is impending does it?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:02:47
Can’t do anything with anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:06:51
I have a little feeling it’s gonna go waaaaaay up...
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:45:22
Tru that. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:40:37
This is why litecoin should take over bitcoin in my opinion. The only thing btc has going for it is that it was the first. Litecoin is better bitcoin, (in terms of tech) and that’s just it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:07
Lol dude they logged me out as I tried to buy the dip and it’s laggy/glitchy as hell. Ffs. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:26:38
Some people say that. At the same time, people have been saying that for awhile. Let’s say it did pop today, and drop 7,000 dollars. Don’t think it would rebound because of all the people buying that dip?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:51:35
I’ll donate. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:33:54
Buy red, hodl till you’re dead. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:07:25
It could mean bad news for bitcoin potentially if isp’s block or slow access to major bitcoin and other crypto servers. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:02
Haha only pissed i bought at 14800 and not 13000!
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:30:37
EVERYONE: it’s wise to not bank with the big banks. 
Firstly they use your money to invest in ethically questionable practices. 
Secondly if a bank is skeletor, isn’t crypto he-man?
Thirdly, go to a federal credit union. No fees, no problems. Put your money in, get it out, easy as pie. The best part is there’s no sketchy BOA using your funds for their own....deeds. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:37:01
Yeaaaah I’m not getting it back if I’ve missed the deadline by that long. Regardless, I’m more focused on the future of these currencies and how I can pay off my student debt in 2020 :) I’ll give it an e-mail and see, though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:12
Not that it matters. I can’t even attempt to purchase anything on Coinbase due to all these error pop ups. Is GDAX working for buying?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:57:46
Hey man. I’m benefiting from this information as well!
One question though, I’m ready to (re)start a portfolio, although I’m wondering if I should wait for a heavy dip. Unsure if it will come due to all this upward movement. 
Would you wait to put thousands in? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:22:01
Not tech savvy.. it’s relatively simple. Just copy/paste your addresses. 
If it helps, create a sheet which labels your wallet name, it’s currency, seed and pass phrase, and any other codes. 
Just go to your wallet, copy the wallet address, and paste into the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:44:27
For cerrrrrreal....
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:35:23
Is it still showing sell and buy orders on Gdax for b c h?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:03:02
Same here. It’s fucking rigged man. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:24:12
Well, I just want to do it smart and not do it based on emotion. Of course I want to believe it’s going up up up, but there seems to be this looming feeling of.. what’s happening next? Human nature creates fear out of uncertainty, so everyone assumes a correction is coming. Which is totally possible. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:29:17
Make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:34:56
Well, yeah, there's risk involved. But bitcoin is such a low risk coin because of it's past.
Lets have a scenario where bitcoin isn't already bouncing back up as i type this. It crashes and dies.
There will be another coin that has to take it's place as king of the rock (Yes i just threw you a Mulan reference) Think it will be bitcoin cash? Nope. The market is getting smart to the point of crypto currencies, that's why ripple reached  today. If this scenario were to take place (which it will, but not for a very long time) the fastest coin with the cheapest transaction fees would take it's place. At some point the market is going to shift from hype money to actual legitimacy and usage. I want that coin to be Digibyte. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:25:27

Sick nerd?? Wow
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:52:42
So really, it's about paying attention and a little bit of luck of knowing when to sell high and when to buy low?
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:51:25
Do you think with the exposure that LTC has it could hold value in a similar way to bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:49:08
But, litecoin has exposure. It's supported by coinbase and Gdax, two of the most popular exchanges. Can you explain the difference between bull and bear markets?
@_date: 2017-09-05 03:52:17
I like this. I just started investing in LTC and already I'm depressed. I'm not trying to make gobs of money now or even on the daily be tracking these graphs of ups and downs.. I like the dollar cost averaging you describe. If my understanding is correct, It's just putting in however many dollars you don't need every day, correct? 
Also- I use coinbase because it's so user friendly. Hell-If i had known that bitcoin would be almost 5k now, I would have kept the 300 bitcoins i had in 2009. But then again, they were in MtGox so... probably would have dissapeared anyways (sadface).
Can I autobuy with GDax? Coinbase's fees are waaay too high. If not, i'll look into possibly using this guys app he created, i don't want these fees from coinbase stacking up on me.
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:20:12
I'm highly interested in this, I just made another post. I'll tag you, I want to talk more about using this app.
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:28:29
Yeah, I'll never live that missed opportunity down, pretty sure i'll still be thinking about it when i'm 90, hahaha. 
I'm a bit confused on the app's function. You say it automatically deposits for you? Why not just hold your btc for years to come? I'll need to do a bit more research on the app because it's not 100% clear as to how it will work for me. 
Oh btw, I did tag you in a recent post I just made on this sub!
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:17:00
Thanks! I'm speculating based on my litecoin investments. I'm hoping that it will have a boom similar to bitcoin in coming years (wish I kept the 300 bitcoins I had in 2009 in Mt. Gox :( 
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:50:49
Well, I'm thinking in terms of gain. I don't want to buy fractions and gain 300 dollars in years, I want to invest in something that's going to go up thousands of percents in years, making a worthwhile profit. Do you think that's still possible in bitcoin with low investments?
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:20:48
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:11:34
Okay, So couldn't you buy at Poloniex or gemini, send your btc to your wallet, send btc to coinbase's wallet... and sell for instant profit?
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:49:59
Yeah. I’m waiting for 6-7k but who knows.
@_date: 2019-09-12 05:20:38
I’ll take a Tesla, electricity ftw.
