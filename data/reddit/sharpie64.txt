"It's what you get for buying a Mac" is my initial thought.  Those things are for writing your first novel in a free trade coffee shop, not mining bitcoins.

If you started selling these:  they'd make a great raffle item interesting to *and* :D

Oh but the drug, sex and assassination trafficking are all okay, right?  
I've got some bad news for you man.  That's the black market and that's how it works.  If somehow some institute "took down" the Silk Road, there'd be another site up the moment before the take down.  They'd probably even name it Polyester Road in humorous spite.

I've never actually won a raffle before so I was quite surprised.

Finding someone local or offering a service is your only good bet.  These other suggestions of pseudo-laundering are all trackable by network activity and account logins.  You're only going to mitigate those by creating new accounts on someone else's internet connection and doing those transactions there.
...of course, then you're using someone else's wifi.  Not typically a legal thing to do unless you're allowed.  Also, not 100% guaranteed you're not being monitored.

I've mined on rigs you people wouldn't believe. GPUs on fire off the edge of my desk. I watched AC units rain condensation in the dark near the floor rot. All those giga hashes will be lost in difficulty... like tears in the rain...

I picked up my first rifle a few weeks back and I've loved it since.

He hasn't defined whether he's looking to hide from attackers or hide from prosecution.  Your points on "attackers" are moot until then.
You also need to review the definition of money laundering.  Buying from established service providers who maintain logs will not get you the results you're looking for.  If coins xyz go in and coins abc come out, the log still shows that he owns abc.

Thanks!  I picked it up at the last gunshow at the AZ state fairgrounds a couple weeks back.

I wanted to post about this sooner, but it has been a rough couple of months.  I won this back in December from Coinabul.  Everyone that I met during the process was really awesome.

This is going to sound mean, but...
The website actually looks like it was written by a retard and most actual listings are blank, lacking model numbers, under described, or worse. This making it first very hard to know if the items are actually what I want and second making it difficult to compare bitcoingunparts.com's price to competitors'. It's great that I can purchase a threaded glock barrel, but I want to know who made it, or if it has any warranty or quality assurance, before I commit to buy it. 
If they were to overcome these limitations which I feel are self imposed, then I'd definitely achieve the boner I want this site to give me. Until then, if there's something you want to purchase from there, I'd be delighted to exchange your cash for my coins.
However, the most important thing to remember is this: For better or worse, there is no trail with Bitcoins.
