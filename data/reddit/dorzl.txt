And many alts use largely the same protocol as BTC, doesn't mean the reward goes to the same miners/investors.

The federal government must feel so dumb for putting all that money into the technologies and people that ended up creating the Internet.
Sure, it became something amazing, but considering how today "Governments are still reeling from the realities of a full blown information age", Big Brother must regret spending those billions on UCLA and giving those R&amp;D tax credits just to nurture an industry that would become 5% of GDP.

This is good for bitcoin.

People were also buying Enron stocks cheap.

And you *hope* it doesn't.

Buying stocks in a company shortly before experiment results are in is taking a risk. Investing in crypto-currencies is blind faith at this point.

It's a game changer, like penny auctions or binary options.

Now why would trolls wish for the death of such an endless source of entertainment, do Game of Thrones fans wish for its conclusion? A slow pitiful spiral toward capitulation, laden with "Bunker Hitler" moments, is so much more satisfying for them.

Would you rather fold, and save the rest of your money, or would you call on the pair of 4's that Bitcoin is, and risk losing more?

I was responding to the often cited argument that Bitcoin being first somehow makes it likely so succeed. I don't know who you're arguing with at this point.

Easy to use, accepted as tender by any merchant, employee, and guinea hamster in the country, insured, relatively stable. Probably more but I'm typing this asleep.

Of course not, and way to shift the goal post. My only point was first to market or even trail blazing doesn't promise long-term success or future domination of a sector. The Nintendo of crypto-currency might be lurking in the bushes as an unassuming alt, and getting too invested in Bitcoin being "first mover" is ignoring history.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:39:58
I think it's the same mechanism that makes us calm when mortally wounded.

I remember when Atari had the first mover advantage. That's why they still dominate console gaming.
@_date: 2015-01-11 15:12:17
As a Bitcoin skeptic, I think the chances of it going to actual zero are almost nothing. There's still a market for old PCs and Atari 2600s, and I'm sure Bitcoin will always find its niche. Still, it doesn't have to get there to make 99% of current holders regret buying into it.

Can oil go bankrupt? Could the Ruble (the Ruble isn't "Russia shares")? Just pointing out that the existence of buyers doesn't say much for the validity of an investment at a certain point in time.

Get on it, idea man.
@_date: 2015-01-19 13:32:36
Sure there was. The more people buy them, the more and better content can be produced for them, the more active community and subculture around them, more merchandise etc.
At the eve of the video game industry crash, the industry had $3.2 billion in revenues in North America alone. Atari 2600 sold 30 million units. How do you quantify Bitcoin's "network" in comparison?

Yeah kid, as you know, Bitcoin is a new form of money invented by a Japanese cryptographer. Just Google "Japanese money shots" and you'll be good. It's the future.
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:43:00
So in your imagination, Internet developed because no one used it. I guess late (current) Bitcoin IS like early Internet!

That means you "have" to take loans because others do. OP's logic is you have to take a loan because your money is in the bank rather than under a mattress.
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:53:13
Doesn't mean the coin is going places.
@_date: 2015-02-23 13:13:01
You know you don't HAVE to take a loan just because you keep money in a bank, right?
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:45:22
I didn't say they were strangers, I implied they were not into Bitcoin, and that you were hoping to change that with a tip.

Clearly other people are dumb, and hodlers who bought in at $600 are the smartest guys in the room.
Separating fools from their money is easy exactly because they never realize what fools they are.

To the "well send it to me then!" crowd: of course he won't. In fact almost no one would have tipped if they knew unclaimed tips went to people already into bitcoin. The whole point is hooking unsuspecting civilians on The Token.
