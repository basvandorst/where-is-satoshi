So we are creating hardware for Bitcoin mining rather than diverting our capital to other human endeavors, such a curing cancer? I contend that that is bad for society.

Did you  read my explanation? I write because I love doing it and discussing economics with the world. If you disagree please explain why so we can discuss.

I am not relating Bitcoin and oil prices. What I am relating is how society devotes capital to their mining/extraction.

Do you agree or disagree? Why?

With regards to  why is that? I don't see any reason why there should be a rule. If computing power, or the electricity that powers it, were to get more expensive for any reason, this relationship would break down. And it should work the other way too. If computing power and/or electric were made cheaper the profit margin would expand.
 Society, government, and individuals judge, rightfully, how people use their capital all of the time. Government puts incentives in place all the time for retirement, health care, research and development, housing, etc. The list goes on. Governments have also funneled capital towards infant industries. And society has always been critical when capital was being wasted or being used in deleterious ways, such as through efforts that are bad for the environment.
 Please explain. I don't understand what you mean by the amount of Bitcoins available from fees.
 I assume /s means "sarcasm?"

People are building and using computers. Computers can do lots of different things. And more so, we should be focusing on the "super-computing" systems that are used for mining. Large conglomerations of computing power are used for important societal endeavors, such as genomic sequencing, which can hopefully help us finds cures for cancer.

That's only in the long run, but in the short run, there is a limited supply of computational effort out there.
