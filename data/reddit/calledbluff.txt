Be careful as the market manipulators adjust their approach knowing people have memory. They will allow this to run and stay up for a longer period to give new comers and longs validation as they buy in or add to there positions. Kind of like those sticky fly strips that hang from the ceiling.

It's going to hit 9k but then again it might stay above 9k and not hit it, and then go up to 10k, but if it does get there it will probabaly go up to 13k but if it doesn't go to 13k it might just go to 11k or 12k but then again it might not get that high for awhile. It could go up to that or down below 9k soon or maybe take awhile. I try to predict it based off of my insecurities of having money that I cant afford to lose invested in it. I talk to my friends like I know about bitcoin but really I don't know shit and just want to get rich and then I can say see I told you and look smart. -- half the clowns on this sub

Many waiting for funds to clear deposit to get in at current prices. 5 digie bitcoin coming just as fast as it went to 4 digie. Smart money held and added. Weak hands have the butterfly in stomach feeling as they sit without any bitcoin waiting for it to go down further after they sold for a loss.

It's pretty simple. Your bank account or trezor have nothing to do with your taxes. Gains and loses on the trade event is what matters. 
If you have 10k and buy bitcoin, then sell at 9.5k, you had $500 lose. 
Now you take your 9.5k and rebuy bitcoin. 
You have $500 lose. 
Now you sell your 9.5k bitcoin for 10k. Now you are 0 net gain/lose. 
Then you buy 10k bitcoin, and sell again for 11k. Now you are 1k realized gain. 
All of those back and forth for the fiscal year. At the end of it all you will either be up or down.
If you buy 5k bitcoin, and it's now worth 10k but you are holding the same coin with no trades inbetween, it is not gain or lose because a gain or lose only triggers when you sell. 
I hope this helps!

Always hodl some. Have an amount that you say you wont touch and just hodl. Anything above that trade with. If you trade successfully you can keep building your hodl amount for free. You have to be disciplined to raise your hodl amount and not touch though, or you can take cash and buy yourself something nice.

Hope those shorting and trading bitcoin are making some money and those selling making money as well. 
For all of the Hodlers, excited to be part of it with you. What is the estimated amount of people in the world that have the mindset of Hodl? 10k? 100k? 1m? 
This a great time to be alive and see this all play out in the next 40 years. Maybe it will only last another 5 years? Or it maybe it will be here for a long time into humans futures. Maybe thousands of years. 
Pretty cool.

It's going to go back down into the 6ks eventually and then after a while it will run back up around 10-12k again and then never go below 9k again.....

Make sure to pay any taxes on gains as it looks like the IRS is taking this very seriously. We will more then likely see news stories in the future of criminal charges for tax evasion. Do not be in that story.

A 7.5% increase in what, USD? 
We don't buy BTC for gains in USD. We could give 2 shits about USD. We care about accumulating Satoshis. We will have many Satoshis when we are old and we are not old.
@_date: 2019-07-27 02:18:00
Realized gain doesn't mean only when it is sent to your own personal bank account. 
Realized gain would be if you bought $100 of bitcoin, then sold that bitcoin for $200. You would have $100 realized gain, in your Coinbase cash account. Transfering it to your trezor or bank account wouldn't matter, it's the sale event that matters. 
This also applies for equities such as a TD Ameritrade account. If you buy X stock for $100 then sell those shares for $200, you have a realized gain even if it just sits in your Ameritrade cash balance.
I hope this helps.

That's not the case here but on side note, even if people are using it to play poker or gamble, why can't they? It is there money to do what they want with it. It is there choice to spend the money or use it how they want. When we can't make our own decisions on what we can spend our hard earned money on, then what is the point?

The year is 2057. Close range space travel (140 million miles and closer to Earth) has become relatively easy and cost efficient. Shuttles fly to and from the Earth's Moon on a regular flight basis, bringing pedestrians, vacation goers, workers, doctors, etc. back and forth. Some live on Earth and work on the Moon commuting. Others live solely on the Moon. 
River and Celiena sit in the food court dome built just 3 years earlier as the 2nd of it's kind on the Moon. Located 2 miles east of of the Eratosthenes crater, River asked Celiena if she wants to eat? The options are plentiful and Celiena shakes her head and grins. They split ways, each heading to their favorite culinary destination agreeing to meet back at the table.
River knows exactly what he wants, and heads over to a short line in the now fully automatic serving Chipotle burrito bar. River pays for his food looking straight forward for 3 seconds at the counter facial recognition scanner. His Bitcoin wallet balance is charged .000002, from a balance he has been living off of for his entire 19 years on the Moon. He has more buying power than 96% of the human population. 
They both meet back at the table and sit there eating, looking up through the crystal clear dome complex at Earth, wondering if anyone there thinks about going to the Moon.

Adoption takes time, this is already past tipping point, every minute that goes by increases Bitcoin world acceptness and adoption. Now it's just a matter of how much time? The lid has been blown off I mean come on, people are willing to pay 10k in usd for 1 Bitcoin. It's in extremely high demand and it hasn't even made it full adoption. It's exciting for anyone that knows what it is and is on these subs. If you own any bitcoin right now and are just holding it, it's more than likely the best investment you can statistically make right now for long term. That and CBD stocks like Charlotte's Web.

The more lose the higher its buying power should be. Maybe 1 satoshi can buy a nice house in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:10:15
Why didnt you just buy when it was in the 3s? 4s? Now you are strategically looking to buy at a price that is double what it was 2 months ago??
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:08:33


Actually most here don't know twinklely dick about what bitcoin is or how it works but they still dump money into it. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:03:06
Hopefully you've been buying.
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:23:09
Bitcoin worth over 10k USD yet the experience of using bitcoins to actually pay for things—supposedly its main application—remains rather rocky.
@_date: 2019-06-10 17:32:04
Try to sell it to a newbie for 8k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:22:06
I want it to dable in 7ks again. Then I promise I will load and HODL for good.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:46:38
Yes I would get out, wait for it to drop more and get more of the bitcoins then.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:34:22
Only a tiny tinky winky percent of the people who buy bitcoin know what it is or anything about it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:12:40
I bet it's around 42k in 5 years.
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:29:41
Coin sent!
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:07:28

@_date: 2019-08-17 04:25:01
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:29:56
When it went from .30 to almost 20k per bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:10:40
You need a basic economic lesson. 
Run in when everyones running out.
Run out when everyones running in.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:55:21
Why does it keep peaking out lower?
@_date: 2019-06-05 02:48:41
Ah, Philippines, now it all makes sense.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:45:19
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:05:05
This is in big trouble.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:26:33
A very tiny tinky winky percent of anyone who buys bitcoin actually has a clue what it is or how it works.
@_date: 2019-08-09 03:07:45
It could be a tax evasion ploy. I would suggest to stay away because what he is doing is more than likely illegal and you would be an involved party.
I believe he is doing everything you are saying. But he needs people with accounts. Why? He's diluting something. Might even be writing off the amount you take as donation. You would make $36,500 annually. Is he 1099ing you? 
If you value your reputation in life and have any morals or ethics, and don't want to get into legal trouble (possibly prision) I would suggest you step away, and also rethink who you are associating yourself with all around. Your friend may be into some shit. I'm sorry.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:22:23
I just made a lot of money......laughing to the bank.
@_date: 2019-12-19 00:26:18
Cool, I sold 7% equity in one of my companies to buy the dip this week.

@_date: 2019-12-07 21:35:15
I recieved about $150 worth of bitcoin from some random person back in 2017. It was awesome and I kept it. Suckers
@_date: 2019-12-26 15:00:17
When everyone is running out, run in.
@_date: 2019-10-17 02:10:15
What does this have to do with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:58:34
Over 10k baby! Over 10k! Can you believe it! 10k for 1 bitcoin! Omg lolzzzz
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:08:21
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:15:21
You have no idea what you are talking about. Deep down inside you know this.
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:14:54
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:49:11
Bitcoin's buying power will be much greater in the future.
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:11:45
Are you asking this after reading the news article?
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:00:03
Yeah, well it sure as hell isnt moon.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:36:42
No not moon. Bitcoin is down 17% on the month, are you fuckin blind!?!?!
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:13:22
@_date: 2019-09-26 01:04:25
Just because you don't understand it doesn't mean its wierd.
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:29:13
What's the deal with this bitcoin thing I have been hearing people talk about? Is it good investment?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:26:32
What happened is it rigged? Are we all suckers?
@_date: 2019-09-17 14:21:20
The US dollar is backed by the military, infrastructure, business, innovation, production, etc. To say the dollar is backed by nothing is pure ignorance. 
The United States has great natural resources, agriculture, forests with raw lumber, fisheries etc. This all influences the value of the USD directly and indirectly. 
The dollar continues to lose buying power as inflation erodes its pull. This will continue as history shows all fiat currencies follow this path. 
But to say the USD is backed by nothing is retarded and whoever made the meme thinks they know more than they do.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:11:00
My Thursday auto buy getting some cheapies today.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:22:45
Yeah it's going to be tough to avoid taxes. The IRS will always nail you eventually.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:49:28
So sad that even bitcoin can be manipulated and corrupted. A species of corruption humans are. Pathetic.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:51:24
What does that mean?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:56:26
I'm not bashing bitcoin, I own stake. Just making a factual statement.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:09:41
I created a reddit account to post this story. Lol finding out real quick how worthless of an idea that was with clowns like you slithering around. 
You've heard this story before, what a joke, that's the definition of trolling as you accuse me of trolling. Take your .0547369 bitcoins and get outta here. ��
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:47:19
I'm sorry for my ignorance. Like I mentioned I dont know much about bitcoin or the community for that matter.
@_date: 2019-05-14 23:17:06
Who is the bitcoin guy in this vid?
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:51:09
I've never told this story anywhere before. You must live in a parallel universe or something.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:03:54
I am not aware of people writing fake bitcoin stories but I can assure you I'm not spending my time coming on here for advice and making up a fake story. I came here to figure out what I have and get some guidance on what I should do. It's not like I can go to my Edward Jones guy and ask.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:59:12
You are assuming I saw the price at 18k when it was at 18k. It's called a historical graph and it was viewed by me for the first time 4 days ago.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:48:01
Maybe the markets on Mars someday will be true and free. We can only hope.
