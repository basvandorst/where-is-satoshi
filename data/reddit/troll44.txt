Bitcoin is for college boys, a guys' game :)

I'm talking about the laws/law enforcement/army to support the US Dollar, not the laws of physics, they complete 2 different things.

There's no law without real army/enforcement, intrinsic is not the laws I'm talking about.

This is one of the best thing of Bitcoin, there's no protection for whatsoever, you screwed then just screwed.
How can you run a business without protection? If all your company's Bitcoins have been accidentally sent to a wrong address, you are bankrupt.

The only way you can make some money out of this is by bringing in more newcomers. If you can find at least one case in the real world like this is not scheme/scam, I may change my mind. 
Edit: OK, I got it. I wish you guys put all your fiat money in Bitcoin to make early adapters richer. Eventually when this scheme/scam got busted, I'd like to hear what you gonna say.
Edit again: Of course all currencies are scam, but the only different is that they are backed up by government/army, you don't need newcomers to support it, everybody in a country simply have to use it.
Since you guys like the idea to create your own money, why don't you create your own army and your own law?

Nice article, thanks. I guess for those Bitcoiners, just let them get screwed, it's the only way to make them understand what a scam/scheme is :(

Without enough newcomers, coins will be harder and harder to sell, eventually price will drop to the ground. There's no unlimited supporters, that's why scheme/scam always got busted.

Keep them as souvenir or make a wallpaper so you can watch your them all the time :)

This is the calm before loooooong calm, the volume is so low with this relative cheap price, I think the adoption rate is going down, whoever likes Bitcoin possible already jumped on the boat. Without enough newcomers, Bitcoin will have to face a slow fading away
@_date: 2014-05-10 17:43:52
I don't get what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 19:10:45
Of course Bitcoin has some good stuff in it, otherwise this scheme/scam wouldn't even get started. People just ignore some fundamental flaws, fox example, how to reverse a transaction in case coins sent to a wrong address.

Why do you say Euro countries or Japan do not have army/enforcement?
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:42:30
"But the army has absolutely nothing to do with currency. "
You either naive or just lying. For example, if you guys are bunch of gangsters with guns, you force all the local people use your "Shit Dollar" print from your basement, they have to use it if they don't want to get killed. So how to remove your "Shit Dollar"? People just simply call in the law enforcement/army to kill you guys, so your "Shit Dollar" will be gone once you guys got killed, no more guns to support your "Shit Dollar".
The theory is very simple, whoever tries to remove US Dollar in the US will be get killed without mercy.

I'm not sure this is joking/sarcasm or talking seriously, but no way that many coins gonna dump to market. I talked to some Chinese Bitcoiners, nobody gonna sell except one if the exchanges closed, so I think price may just stay this level for another 3 months.
