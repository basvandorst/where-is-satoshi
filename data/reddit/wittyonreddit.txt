He is making a good point but a country needs the tax because it has to build the infrastructure, provided citizens with free schools and child benefits to etc etc. 
However it needs to tax the super rich more and the average people less.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:27:50
Why do you say so?
@_date: 2019-07-22 01:30:12
Agreed. But it’s hard to deny that shit is valuable. FB, Google, etc.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:10:14
When did it hit 6400?
@_date: 2019-07-15 01:59:46
It will definitely rise. I would rather hold than sell off when I see my first loss.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:41:57
That sounds good. I will give it a try. ��
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:07:05
I wanted but a car and a new Mac etc. Now I am like, “Do I need them or want them?” ���� And I got my answers.

Ice cream melted but BTC didn’t ��
@_date: 2019-07-08 19:40:09
Add Coinberry to Canada.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:44:57
BTC is all about long term.
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:09:47
I don’t know if this is from your personal experience or copy pasted but either way, the fact that you posted this as sensible advice is the best thing I have seen in a while. The last point was gold - Health is wealth. 
Sometimes we forget why we started running and when the end comes we realize that we were either running in the wrong direction or there was no need to run for most of the time. ����

This video is gold. Probably will be featured in some documentary in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:02:27
Really? Repeating pattern ?
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:17:26
Feb might see 50 and fall down. The past saw 20 and fell to 3.

What is a lightning wallet?
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:39:01
Now if Facebook wasn’t in USA and some other country like Panama, out of reach of the big 5 and FB were to introduce this, the global money reserve would go straight for a collapse.

@_date: 2019-07-22 00:44:54
Using BRD. No issues so far.
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:51:30
How are the fees there compared to Coinberry.
@_date: 2019-07-25 15:02:48
Yeah. That’s a miracle.
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:56:04
BTC was 4k in April. Hit 13 in June. You never asked why didn’t it stay at 4k. Growth was good new to you and it fell 3K and now that sucks?
Have courage and hold on my friend. We are all lucky to be at the begging of something great. The next generation will be wishing why they weren’t born a few years earlier.
@_date: 2019-07-15 02:11:45
Even if it is 1 dollar I would have bought at least 10. Today, I could have retired ��
@_date: 2019-07-18 19:29:54
Hahahahaha �������������� That’s exactly how it is ����

CB is slow when you are a new customer. Door a good reason but can be super annoying at times. There have been times when my friends were pressed to but at a so but they couldn’t because duh for obvious reasons. 10 days is super slow though. 
Use this number to call them directly.

By the way which wallets are you guys using?
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:44:38
It seems pretty stable though.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:28:58
I understand. But you been to hold on a little. Definitely this will be worth way more than what it is today. Again only put as much as you can lose.
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:26:10
Couldn’t paint a clearer picture. Would have given you gold but right now words is all I can give.

How’s your experience with Bisq so far? Any pitfalls or bad experiences you want fellow users to avoid?
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:20:08
BRD is good. No issues so far.
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:26:15
How much did you have?
@_date: 2019-08-30 00:33:50
It is good. Or there’s Shakepay too.
@_date: 2019-08-14 04:15:40
So if Current price of bitcoin is one thousand dollars and I buy it then with 0.15 percent it would be 1.5 dollars. I can but one bitcoin for 1001.5 dollars?
@_date: 2019-08-14 06:10:41
That’s probably the cheapest on web. What’s the withdrawal charges though?
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:09:36
Lol. I can remove the tech if you want and it can be implicitly understood ��
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:23:45
Try Coinberry.
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:27:57
Bank of America is testing Ripple now.
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:11:29
�� the financial system is a joke now.
@_date: 2019-08-14 05:31:37
If 1 BTC is worth 1000 what’s the buying and transfer rates?
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:28:26
How much do you have?
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:47:36
Hahahaha. It was just a theory. I was wondering how it would go if I kept transferring on and on. I wouldn’t do that in reality. Transferring 50 dollars cost 5 dollars network fee. Would 5000 or 100,000 still cost 5 dollars transaction fee? Exchange says no withdrawal fees though. Not sure why it cost.
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:11:21
Which wallets are you all using? Other than hardware wallets everything else seems vulnerable.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:41:15
And big countries like India and Russia I guess still have them banned.
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:20:54
Can you please explain the last part? Sweeping individual addresses?
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:19:15
Needs verification?
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:10:25
Hahaha. That’s probably the safest option now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:21:33
Got the transaction through now. Had to be cautious when the previous transactions were quick and this one wasn’t. 
Looking at the graph looks like transfer times are more than normal.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:03:39
But that’s a hardware wallet isn’t it?
@_date: 2019-10-07 05:17:47
Shakepay and Coinberry are good.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:34:37
But I don’t think this is going to fall below 10k this time because the tech is more mature this time around.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:22:13
Exactly. Less profit but less risk too.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:53:58
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:17:43
It is not Coinbase. Nothing in the junk email folder as well. I have done this a couple of times earlier but never had a problem. Btw. Which wallet do you suggest to use apart from the cold storage one? For mobile. Android and iOS.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:15:36
Thanks for the reply. Here is a good use case why I would keep them transferring over and over. I might hold some for long-term but then I decided to change my mind and transfer them from hardware to the mobile or PC based one. And so on and so forth.
@_date: 2019-06-21 04:04:30
There’s so many wallets out there sometimes it’s so hard to make a decision.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:30:19
I will definitely regret selling off the BTC of it goes to 100k but if the bubble bursts, I will be safe.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:25:21
Seeing things the way they are. I think they will be highly trafficked. Until, if it happens, the bubble bursts.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:47:44
Thanks ��

Bitcoin in ten years will make you rich enough to have ten girlfriends.
Girlfriend for ten years will make you poor enough and she will leave you in debt ������
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:19:43
BRD is good. Been using it for a while. What are the disadvantages though? As far as I have heard ETH doesn’t seem to be syncing well.
@_date: 2019-10-20 05:16:49
By another bank? ��
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:24:25
BRD seems good but I am sure there are many with more experience than me.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:11:17
Thank you for your wonderful reply. How will I know if the wallet and the exchange support lightning network will it be mentioned?
Will be transaction fees for transferring points from A phone or computer wallet to a hardware one or paper one?
The way I remembered, the transaction fees was in percentage which means it doesn’t matter how much I am transferring I stand to lose for example five percentage in transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:41:03
I have done it in the past. It was totally fine.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:42:03
Canceled forever? Like end of crypto?
@_date: 2019-06-25 23:17:31
It doesn’t support xrp right?
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:28:44
What’s Segwit? BRD converts it?
@_date: 2019-09-12 03:00:21
BRD seems decent. Popular among iOS users.
@_date: 2019-09-13 05:15:15
Sure. I will give it a try thanks.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:33:48
So I think it is like every app uses its own address but since you own all the apps all the coins belong to you. Correct?
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:29:22
Plus I was not aware that the exchange take some money when they transfer coins from the exchange to the wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:38:37
Ah. That’s bad. I wouldn’t trust them if they are not transparent. Mistakes and delays happen but he transparent about it.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:33:03
That is so comforting to hear. ������ Thank you.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:35:07
Oh thanks. 
May I ask what custom fee you are talking about?
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:41:11
I have heard about this wallet. It’s also easy to use isn’t it?
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:43:55
Each address as in bitcoin or ETH?
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:51:21
Is it possible to transfer to GdaX from other exchanges?
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:38:30
Now Amazon is gonna own bitcoins and become richer.
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:15:05
Are you talking about Trezor and Ledger?
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:34:48
What other wallets do you use? And do you use the same wallet address or created multiple wallet addresses in the BRD app?
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:53:33
The exchange says zero withdrawal charges. There’s a small star with a disclaimer that they are not responsible for what miners would charge.
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:16:24
Coinberry is good in Canada. Your opinions please.
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:17:02
Things like these gives you jitters when it comes to the credibility of the app.
@_date: 2019-05-13 00:06:15
Thanks for explaining but I have no idea what you are talking about. The sync on BRD wallet?
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:54:53
From the window to the ground.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:50:19
I am F\*\*\*\*\*d.
@_date: 2019-05-14 01:45:00
Oh damn. What would my options be then? Leaving it in exchange is quite risky.
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:54:17
I’m not whining. It is more of a learners’ shock.
@_date: 2019-05-10 04:03:55
Which wallets do you recommend? Apart from Trezor and Ledger. For BTC, ETC and XRP on iOS and Android. And what beginners mistake can be committed?
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:32:33
Green wallet is on the App store? Couldn’t find it.
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:07:11
I assume that you have been using it for quite a while now?
The exchange to wallet takes a fee. Damn.
@_date: 2019-05-12 18:27:42
Some recommend it all the way. Which wallet are you using?
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:43:35
