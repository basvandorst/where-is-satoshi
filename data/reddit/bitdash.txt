No, it's not a deterministic wallet. Keys have to be backed up digitally. We can definitely look into implementing this later on.

Don't you just have to pay some money to become a member of the Bitcoin Foundation?

Wow. This level of incompetence is astounding. I thought this would have all ended with MtGox gone, but it looks like the Gox lives on.

As always, there is nothing wrong with proceeding with caution.
We're in the process of incorporating our business, and more details about that will be released when we're ready.
The software is unheard of because it is new. Developers are working on new software all the time. We are not in the business of building malware, as that is not in our best interests.
If you have questions to ask, please feel free to do so.

We've been working on this for the past few weeks and the aim was to build a wallet with an interface that is very easy and straightforward to use for your average user.
The app stores public/private keys on the device, and the private keys never leave the device. The chain.com API is used for retrieving wallet balances, recent transactions,a nd for sending signed transactions.
The release is still beta, so there could still some bugs that need to be sorted out. Suggestions and feedback are welcome.
We're not asking for donations, but if you feel like you want to support the project or donate, then please send a message to our inbox, and we'll give you our address.

We don't have any plans to release the source code at this point. This may change in the future.
Offline mode pretty much means the app interface can be navigated without a network connection.
Offline transaction signing is possible, but the current transaction process requires a connection to check for available unspent inputs, and send the signed transaction hex to the chain.com API. The actual signing is done by the device. If this is a feature that is in popular demand, it would not be too hard to implement.

Ah, right. Sometimes, I keep thinking we're still in 2014.

Wasn't it $66 at some point early last year?

A bit of a self-plug, but if you're using an Android device, you could check out [Bitdash Wallet]( on the Play Store. It's easy to use and we're constantly working on improving the app and adding new features.
