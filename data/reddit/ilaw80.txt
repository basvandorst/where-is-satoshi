I'm right there with you too. First I was like wow what do you guys do for a living to be able to spend that much fiat on btc? But then I realize they probably are just like me except had the foresight to invest in btc while very cheap and have now reaped the awards. I'm happy for you guys even though I'll probably never be able to do the same. We can just continue to invest what we can afford to loose and hopefully the market repays us years down the road like it has them.

Depends on how much in debt and interest rates. Pay off loans if at a high interest rate. Bitcoin is great and is probably the future but anything could happen.

I'd like to be entered into contest if not too late.

Yes. Owning a 1 bitcoin is a dream for most. I wish I had a whole bitcoin. Maybe one day. My friend has a titan physical bitcoin. I’ll hopefully have 1 someday if it ever dips low enough.

Can he redeem the forked coins also with same key?

Probably just to try and eliminate fraud.

That’s awesome man. Here I am wishing I had one bitcoin hodl. Hope it works out for you buddy. The 14k a person is good information and should help.

Don't do it!!! Just stop contributing to your 401k and add that to bitcoin purchases if you must. But never withdraw from your 401k before retirement.

Was just gonna trade some vanilla gift cards I got for gifts for bitcoin if the site was legitimate, but I don’t see any reviews.

I'm wondering if the same thing.
