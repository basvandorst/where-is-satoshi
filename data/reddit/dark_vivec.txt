Those businesses and charities that accept bitcoin should have been exchanging it right after for USD. Lots of services that facilitate bitcoin transactions for companies do that automatically. If they held onto it, then they were basically gambling with the rest of us.
Bitcoin is a great system but right now its too volatile to keep the wealth in bitcoins unless they were willing to get on the ride.

Ie. they mean nothing. Which is why they're so fun to watch after the fact.

Welcome to hindsight, I don't really feel like giving any comforting statements because they'll just be turned against me any time bitcoin goes up at all. If you want to gamble, good for you.

I like the donations request for bitcoins on a page that claims bitcoin was hacked.

If you ask me tomorrow I can tell you when you should have bought today. I give 20/20 hindsight advice that is never wrong.

It almost looks like you're trying to be noble and support bitcoin but with the comment about "holding" it just seems like you're another speculator looking to make a "quick" buck in the future. Obviously, not quick in the literal sense, but by holding you certainly aren't doing anything to sustain it as a currency either.
Hell, at least the speculators buying and selling actively draw attention to the currency. Probably the best part about this bubble, bringing in so much mainstream attention.

Why would "bears" have anything invested right now and why would they be any position to sell right now? This is all the "bulls" selling. If you happen to like using those terms.
