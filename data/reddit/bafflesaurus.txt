Agreed, the dude you replied to needs to turn down the hyperbole a notch. At least my cash in the bank is insured. Happily hodling my crypto but if I lose my private keys or hardware wallet it's game over as far as that money is concerned.

Cropped screenshots aren't really conclusive 'proof' of anything, anyone can right click a page and edit text to whatever they want.

Out of curiosity, why 2020?

Ashley Madison is probably the best example of this. Hard to imagine the legal fees of all the divorces which came from that hack.

I would definitely buy sexy time stuff with bitcoins. Anything to keep CCBill out of my bank statements.
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:58:28
I agree, especially since almost anyone who has tried to set up any sort of online business of the variety has ended up getting knocked over for insane amounts of BTC; SR by FBI, Sheep market by some random European guy and couple others I'm forgetting (Atlantis, BMR any others?). If people who build websites to sell illegal narcotics can't secure themselves against theft how is the average Joe (with a legal enterprise) going to stand a chance?

I would say drugs like everyone else if it weren't for the shitstorm going on in right now (majority of DNMs have been seized people going to prison etc.). Donate it to something like  maybe?

Wow that's scary. I hope no one got hurt. This is precisely why our house safe is hidden so well you'd need a metal detector to find it.

When you think about it BTC is really the first time we've been able to gain back some independence from the central banks that Jefferson was rightfully opposed too. It's good to see that people associated with the US Mint are beginning to understand this.

If you see BTC reaching anywhere near 1k it's time to start selling if you're looking to make short-term gains. The highest recorded price according to wiki is $1250.

People are brainwashed into thinking these substances aren't drugs simply on the basis that they are legal and that big brother says "they're ok".

Wow, that kids a genius. Wouldn't that amount of money put him well in advance over the median income for that country?
@_date: 2016-01-05 08:35:57
Honestly... If people spent as much money on BTC as the are willing to spend on LoL skins or hats in steam games they'd be making a much better investment.
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:37:55
Definitely misquote,these people can't afford to buy a gallon of milk and even the wealthiest have trouble finding basic medicines. I really doubt anyone is paying $80k for a BTC in VZ. The people who could afford to do that have most likely already left the country.

This is an absurd hypothetical situation; just because the U.S. government *can* do something like this doesn't mean it ever will.

This isn't really how American politics has ever worked. All of these sentiments went down the drain with Bretton Wood, and the co-opting of democracy via lobbyists and the oligarchs that control politics. Almost all of these factors are well known by anyone who spends at least five minutes on the subject of why American politics are shit.

I appreciate your sincerity but "getting the news out" won't really change anything. People protested wall street en masse for almost a whole year and nothing happened. There are many Americans who know the things I'm talking about but like me they're so jaded and cynical about how powerless we are to change things for the better that all thats left to do is sit on our hands and go with the flow or expatriate to another country.

People have been saying the entire system will collapse for years and it hasn't happened yet. It's like all those people who sold everything they owned during the false rapture prophecy in 2011 or the 2012 mayan doomsday predictions. Do you really want to be an emu with their head in the sand?
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:29:32
Just like everyone and their mothers I wish I had as much in BTC back then as I do now. I would've made so much freaking money... That is enough to sober anyone up.

Too bad Rand Paul has no chance of ever getting elected. He's been near dead last in polls since he started running. It's a shame since he seems to be the most level headed republican candidate.

No I haven't I checked the tracking but there is no information on where it may even be or any indication that it has gone past the first hop so it could be lost for all i know. I'll see if I can get a response from them.

@_date: 2015-11-05 02:25:38
Why? It's all unrealized gains anyways, the only thing you would have to be afraid of at that amount is shorting at 400 or something stupid.
