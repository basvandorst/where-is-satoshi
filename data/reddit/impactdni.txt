You _definitely_ need to create more blocks.  Otherwise you're not solving any of the 51% problem, you're actually making it worse (removing miners from pools and into something that doesn't strengthen the blockchain).  The only people mining blocks would then be the pools (with a smaller hashrate, but a smaller total block-mining hashrate as well).

The issue is, without a chain, you don't have a definition of "previous" unless you're talking about using the actual bitcoin block chain.  I would assume the mini-shares we're talking about would also be trying to solve and verify a real block (just lower difficulty blocks), and the idea would be at some point you get lucky (just like p2pool/pools) and actually create a full block.  But at that point, what is the coinbase actually pointing to?

I'm not 100% sure, but I think the reason for the chain is for verification purposes.  You can ensure that when a share is found, it was accurately trying to mine a block to pay all the other miners (and not submitting shares where you might only pay your shares for example).  
Without a chain (and thus a head), you would need to submit with each share, a somehow verifiable list of what transactions were being hashed in the share, and some way for everyone else to validate that those are the correct transactions.  And depending on how low of a difficulty was set, this could be a large number of shares (network propagation becomes a factor).

You're describing exactly how p2pool works.

However, you're only increasing the total hashrate (difficulty) calculation then (same as mining with a pool).  The only people creating blocks (and thus can perform a 51% attack) are the pools.  The 51% attack would be easier (you only need to control 51% of the block-mining hash power, even if the individual blocks were higher difficulty).

Quite clean.
Minor suggestion, summary row at the bottom with totals :)

Literally his first words in the post are "I'm not particularly knowledable about bitcoin".  I'm not sure he understands the game.

Even better, thanks :)
