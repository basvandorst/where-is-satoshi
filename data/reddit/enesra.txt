You're a rebel without a clue. The only reason what makes USD shit is the inflation, banks have a bad name as they print and receive bailouts, there is nothing wrong with bitcoin banks, or any banking for that matter, as long as it's a purely free market bank and has nothing to do with any government forced monopoly. I can easily understand how people don't appreciate the wild west of managing their own wallets and copy pasting public keys to send funds, maybe bitcoin banks will find a way to secure their wallets that is 99.999% sure it will last till the end of the internet, maybe a smart contract/oracle will do the job. If such thing would exist, there will be no reason to not buy cryptocurrencies. And if you don't like it, or don't trust the bitcoin bank, you can always manage your own wallets. That's the free market.

This is the internet, this isn't real life, you can't pull off these sophists dishonest tricks on the internet as everyone can see what I wrote. Wanna exchange names? I wanna see how people like you look like irl. Were you spanked as a child? I can give you my facebook account anytime. I'm very interested in people like you.

it's more inevitable that you'll be keylogged once in a lifetime and lose all your bitcoins. i'm talking about the future, not the present. maybe there is no way for bitcoins to be SECURELY attached to your identity instead of your private key right now. but believe me, it's a must for bitcoin adoption. atleast if you wan't to see a future where we buy our bread in satoshi instead of the merely speculative shit that it is right now. I repeat, it's detrimental for a future of genuine bitcoin adoption where we don't buy our bread in dollars but in satoshi

it's a genuine question, i like to guess how he was raised by the way he "reasons" with people

That doesn't imply 'there currently is free banking in the US', that also doesn't imply that 'banking receiving protection &amp; bailouts from government is free market'. You are completely dishonest and you know it. I can say with 90% certainty that you were spanked as a child.

You are saying you simply couldn't access your bitcoin wallet until go on a computer on the continent? What decides what is the mainnet? Don't you think it will simply hard fork like Bitcoin Cash &amp; Bitcoin? Couldn't the miners on the island still run the chain, but with different consensus? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:49:29
it will never happen. i still would like to hear an answer to my question though, would bitcoin hard fork &amp; never be able to reconnect again?

Are there more people that make money out of this? 
How come it's not balanced out?
