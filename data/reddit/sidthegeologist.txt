My family says the same thing to me. The problem is, they don't really understand (or want to) cryptocurrencies.
Pulling out the original investment and leaving the profits is really safe IMHO and I have done the same.
Talking and discussing Bitcoin with someone who isn't Interested is going to be a pointless endeavour. That's one reason I enjoy this sub reddit so much (and a few other YouTube channels like Antonop, Data Dash, Crypto Investor).

Yup. Isn't this similar to one of the basic principles of Bitcoin? Decentralisation. There is no one leader/central authority. We are all learning from each other and collectivity forming our own opinions to help each other and ourselves.

Should have HODLed!

I think the best place is this sub reddit.
Yeah sure there are a tonne of memes, but just scroll down and read the comment discussions. Most of which is a very interesting debate and discorse on current topics on Bitcoin.

That's a very smart thing to do! Only invest how much you are comfortable to lose. But isn't Bitcoin's value as a currency dependant on how much it is actually used? I mean, if we were to all just HODL it until we get a reasonable return thats great but what's the point of the new currency when no one wants to spend it day-to-day? The trouble is that not many places (apart from online stores accept BTC yet)(in the UK).

Lucky you! I wish I had gotten in that early! Would it make sense to sell then reinvest the profits back onto btc? What about drip-feeding BTC a little every month through something like bitwage from my employer? I really think this is the future of money and am in for the long term.

Lol! I guess it's like that all over the Internet. My hypothesis is that it's just our current form of communication (memes) in this day and age. I personally enjoy the combination of light-hearted memes followed by discussions, makes it feel more personal and less formal like a memorandum notification at work!

True. Wise words. I should have hadmore faith not to doubt!

Thanks for the tip and reminder of Bitcoin's volatility! To be safe I have only put in what I think is affordable  right now (in terms of Fiat), the golden rule of investing: 'don't put in what you're not prepared to lose!' 
Its nice to be optimistic, but you're right. We need to be cautious as well. The banking system and Fiat will not go down without a fight. 
 Cheers for the help mate!

Lol! Was on the met line, due to the crowd, I couldn't get a still photo. Sorry for the motion blurs lol! 
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:54:37
Exactly! It then sounds too much like those cryptocurrency trading ads I skip all the time on YouTube! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:45:54
Wow! Thanks for the tips! I'm going to read these now! Perhaps I'll perhaps start with "The Internet of money" as it sounds easier though!

Andreas Antonopolous. He's been very vocal on YouTube trying to get more people into the idea of Bitcoin and blockchain technology.
He has many interesting videos on YouTube on his channel:

I wish I had 4000 Bitcoins though! Today has been one hell of a ride! 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:39:32
I've only ever watched his videos, which inspired me to read the Bitcoin White Paper and then started HODLing. Wish I had done it sooner! How is his book?

Much better photo mate! Lol!
