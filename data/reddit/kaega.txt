All bets are off.   Is the local wallet unencrypted to disk when logged in to blockchain.info ?  If so, all bets are off unless you have vetted all apps running.  I'd be willing to bet a lot of these "stolen from blockchain.info" are on rooted phones.

To follow this up.  Enable two - factor authentication on your account.    
Set a password on your bitcoin-qt wallet.
In coinbase, do the "request a payment" to get a receiving address.   In bitcoin-qt,  send your coins to the coinbase address.   Once it shows on coinbase, sell the coins whenever you want and in about 3 days they will deposit that amount in your bank.

The easiest solution will probably be the following:
Bitcoin-qt password protect wallet.  Generate address. 
Send coins from blockchain.info to address. 
Backup wallet in bitcoin-qt.
Upload wallet back to blockchain.info but don't sweep keys.
Fyi.  You better have two factor authentication and the "spend" password set on blockchain.info.
The other option would include getting the private key from your blockchain.info backup and manually adding via the debug/cli on the bitcoin-qt client.

To be clear, "pay through paypal" will be frowned on here due to paypal reversing transactions should you cry fraud.  The owner of BTC would be out his (partial) coin and you'd get the reversal.   You are also likely to have your paypal account locked up for dealing with bitcoin.

I doubt a major crash will happen again. There are multiple stronger exchanges and now buying diversity from China. 
You may get slight corrections, but just looking at the buy books shows to much demand to fall very far.  The only way think it'll crash now if a bug is exposed within the source that wound undermine the coin itself.

The 60 USB make around 0.011765007227491/day based on my calculations.  I have them rolled in with my BFL miners, so I do not have individual payouts.
I use cgminer - 
The cubes/blades are the best value currently, but again evaluate what they will return in their lifetime before making a decision.  It may, with the current trend in BTC value, be more profitable to just buy and hold BTC.
EDIT: that said, there are several new generation miners coming out in Q1 2014 with better value.  CoinTerra, Black Arrow, KNCMiner and if ButterflyLabs actually meets their timetable this time, the Monarch.

Extremely volatile ATM.  Look at the long term graphs then look at the 24 hour ones.  Most posts suggest to watch it over the weekend and buy when you're comfortable.

The problem is the release is end of February.   Now it is the cheapest $ to GH/s around currently and this is how you should evaluate your purchases.
Second thing is to evaluate the difficulty jumps since ascis have been shipping as it has been around 18 to 26% jumps every two weeks.  Now this should tapper off but I don't think it will till late 2 014 due to kncminer, cointerra, Black arrow and bfl releasing 28nm products in Q1/2 2014.
I bought miners from bfl in April for 100 coins when btc was around $45 I had banked thinking they were going to deliver within 2 months.  I got my miners in oct. and due to difficulty they currently only make 8 coins a month.  With less each month.    Now you can say wow 8k, but that is only in the last 14 days.  Had I held the coins, 100,000.   
So I'd still mine, if you buy with fiat.   But based on my history, continually buying coins would have netted a much larger return.
My loose projection based on the past growth and potential of all these upcoming machines puts the difficulty up near 2.5 billion at end of feb.  
Consider cointerra too, but be leary of any deadlines projected by bfl.

If you know of some high speed nodes, you could add "connect=IPADDR" into your bitcoin.conf but it'll only connect to those nodes.
If you use addnode=IPADDR, it'll get peer lists from those nodes and might speed up your download.
@_date: 2013-11-30 08:59:35
Well, if you downloaded cgminer as source and built it, it would be the unpacked file as a folder (ie: cgminer-3.8.3)
It doesn't look like there is a pre-built binary available for download, so at some point either you or someone else "built" the cgminer executable.  This is done via a "terminal" window.  The "zipped" archive would have been something like cgminer-3.8.3.tar.bz2 and unpacked you'd have a folder "cgminer-3.8.3".

If the seller used BitPay, there'd be no need as he could have opted to convert to fiat on the transaction.

Want it "right now"?
Buy from CanaryInTheMine on Bitcointalk 
30GH/s Cube 1BTC - 
10GH/s Blades .38 BTC - 
Just think about how long these miners will take to "return" your 1 btc worth.  
I have 60 of the USB Miners (335 MH/s) ordered from Canary, he shipped within 12 hours of ordering and arrived 2 days later.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:48:22
Again, the gamble is the hardware being delivered on time.  In my case, bfl delivered 8 months after I ordered and I was told 2 months.
So everything is a gamble so don't risk more than you are comfortable losing.  I hedge by buying btc now as well.    I have some x-1 on order but I'd like to get a cointerra on order as well.
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:44:13

If you can vaguely recall building it by downloading a file, "unpacking it", and doing things like:
**./configure --enable-icarus; make install**
Then re-open a terminal window via Applications -&gt; Utilities (folder) -&gt; Terminal
Type **ls** to see the directories, if you unpacked there you can "change directories" to the cgminer you see by **cd cgminer-3.8.3** and then type **make uninstall**  Once that completes, move "up" a directory via **cd ..**  and remove the cgminer source with **rm -rf cgminer-3.8.3**

Are you behind a proxy?  Check the headers, just log them all for a time.  Use 
ob_start(); print_r($_SERVER); $out = ob_get_clean(); error_log($out,3,/path/to/templog);
You could use apache_request_headers() instead of $_SERVER, but you might want REMOTE_HOST.  
Single out and block the IP.  This may end up being a tit-for-tat if they hop IPs, but you could also embed some onLoad JS to redirect to .com but encode the string so they can't just string replace it.
This is why I pony up the $10 for .net/.org for each .com I register.
