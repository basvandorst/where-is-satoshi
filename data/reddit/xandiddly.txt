Hey just to go a bit further than what was mentioned previously.
You have a chance. It's one slim chance, but it's there.
So you missed the original claim deadline, I totally get why you didn't bother claiming, a lot of people felt how you felt at the time. The issue is, that is not what would be called an 'exceptional circumstance' in the eyes of the trustee. 
If perhaps you were not made aware of the claims process (e.g. not received the email or post) or were incapacitated (perhaps in prison or a coma) then you may have a shot. 
If you have that many coins in MtGox my advice would be to locate the paper claim form and send that off ASAP. If you're in the financial position to discuss this with a lawyer I would highly recommend it. Especially a Japanese lawyer, English speaking, specialising in bankruptcy law. This sounds insanely difficult, but if you look in the right places you can find one, afterall, we did.
If you never made a claim, you will never receive your coins. I'd get on this ASAP if I were you.
Irrespective of wether you fail to do this or not, their may be one more chance but I would not count on it. If the trustee agrees to move from bankruptcy to civil rehabilitation, there is a very slim yet subjective possibility that all claims (potentially including unclaimed accounts) may need to be re-evaluated. We are currently discussing this at  (I suggest joining this if your claim is accepted). A window may appear for new claims to come forward, if this happens it may not be open for long so keep your ears to the ground. 
If I can be of more assistance please let me know :)

This could very well be one of the few bankruptcies in history where creditors came off better as a result. Few would have predicted this would happen so I totally get why it irks you. After all, you can only control what is in your power to control.
Our lawyer is working with a huge group of APPROVED creditors so would not be suitable in your circumstances. I'll try to dig out some info for you later if you don't mind :) in the meantime I suggest you search for both the trustees details (I believe they have a call centre you may be able to speak to) as well as sourcing a lawyer, I can help you find the firm but finding a lawyer is something you'll need to do yourself in afraid I wouldn't know where to look.
Best of luck and chat soon. :)

Posting this (email) online will only increase the chances of a legitimate claimant being defrauded by a scammer. Perhaps provide a little context as to exactly why you need this rather than saying 'School project' with a throwaway reddit account.

It's a decent start for an independent business. Coinbase doesn't charge fees too (which helps with the discount).

That is awesome

Keep an eye on mtgox.com - method for filing will be launched at an unknown time in the near future
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:14:13
You can claim for them in the future, it will be announced on mtgox.com but you'll need your credentials
@_date: 2018-06-24 09:12:06
Yes. The old claims process was due bankruptcy, the new one is for civil rehabilitation
@_date: 2018-06-23 19:47:28
You cannot claim yet, you will have to wait until they announce the claim method in mtgox.com

It's an awesome idea and if you're serious I'd suggest British jewellers Diadem Jewellery.

They pretend that Bcash is actually Bitcoin so yes very scammy. If you want bitcoin you should use a trusted exchange.
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:12:41
No. It states in the Q and A section on the pfd available on mtgox.com that mtgox is not coming back and the deadline will be re opened for new claims
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:29:18
Great question! We are no longer in bankruptcy but in civil rehabilitation. Imagine mtgox didn't sell bitcoin but sold solid gold bars. Some people had money and some owned entire bars. Now let's say the owner of the company was so negligent that someone came in and stole most of the gold bars, not great.
Then years later the price of gold went through the roof, that bar you bought it now worth much more, shouldn't you benefit from that price increase too? Well that's what civil rehabilitation is all about.
Now if everything goes to plan, bitcoin holders should be in for a nice payout. We'll never receive 100% of the gold bars (bitcoin) back but we will receive more than the $450 for each bitcoin when payout comes.
That is unless someone tries to sabotage the CR plan.

This is awesome thank you!

For now. The trustee is investigating the legal ability to repay what is left of the bitcoin and bitcoin cash as they are. However in the event that is not possible I imagine they will liquidate everything and repay everyone with fiat. Slowly, hopefully.

My only feedback would be to increase the amount of pulls for current price as its changing so quickly recently. Maybe every 30 mins if its not too strenuous on the server.
@_date: 2019-02-25 17:52:23
Ah I get you.
The reason for the push to CR instead of BR is because the trustee has basically valued all the BTC at around $450 each. This is because, for legal reasons a price had to be assigned to them, they cannot be seen in law (bankruptcy) to go up and down in price.
Now where it gets a lil cool and weird. When BTC increased in value recently, the trustee, thankfully, decided to sell a good chunk of Bitcoin (and also bitcoin cash as bitcoin forked during the process) and now that money from the sales has been added to the estate. This means that in theory, if bitcoin became near worthless, all the creditors would receive close to $450 per coin and all fiat holders paid back 100% - so if it all went balls up, then people would still receive the crappy payout of $450 per coin.
Now civil rehabilitation means that the $450 cap on coins is lifted, so if bitcoin now increased to $10000 each, then the creditors should receive extra back. Instead of that money going to Mark K for example.

Brock is literally talking about how great it would be for HIM to give us OUR money back from the civil rehabilitation. Trouble is, we already were. He's simply taking credit under the delusion he owns Gox. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:43:27
Yes, he's seen the statements!
