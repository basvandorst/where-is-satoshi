I'm going to be the minority comment in this thread but to be honest with you man, dead serious, bitcoin had nothing to do with your brother's mental health and suicide, had it been bitcoin, a girl, a bully, whatever you name it, he probably would have killed himself even if bitcoin never existed, how do I know this? in 2011 my best friend from high school and I mined and bought 45,000 bitcoin only to sell everything for $2 each when it went from $13 to $2 literally within hours. I am living one the happiest lives that I can and I don't fret about what could have been, many of us are in the same boat but fuck dude, I would choose life over half a billion bucks 100% of the time without a single hesitation whatsoever.

@_date: 2017-11-26 05:06:58
If you are new to Bitcoin and wondering why it's so valuable, please read this:
Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
Check out this great articles:
What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?
"How do Bitcoins have value?"
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see Blockchain technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than Google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible into smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:
Very cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (with new apps coming)
Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
Open source (auditable by anybody)
Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.

@_date: 2017-10-16 04:01:33
Didn't mean to offend you but you cannot compare current crypto growth to that of 2011, different ball game same sport.

I'm investing for a Lamborghini. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:06:32
Would you rather pay off a "car" now, ~$20,000 or have half a mill in 3 years?
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:01:17
Then I buy more.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:18:06
Nice!! Hopefully you get more than 1btc
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:45:21
I posted that I made a 50% return in 30 days, just buying and holding. I bought at 3900 and when I posted it the price was 5850, now we are at 6200+ still hodling
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:55:55
Yes it works. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:12:39
I do use gemini but 5oo limit kills
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:36:07
Cost of locking in the price. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:42:29
Will buy more more when it dips. My dca is low. My first bitcoin cost me $36
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:13:09
Yes sir you know history tends to repeat itself back when I bought at 200 people said the exact same thing
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:55:22
HE WHO'S NAME NOT BE MENTIONED.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:37:16
What the heck did you not see the picture I don't even have the Bitcoin until next week how the hell can I sell something that I don't even have yet 
I bought a bunch of Bitcoins when it was at 600 and didn't sell when it hit down to 200 just bought more
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:12:32
Yes but in 5 days what if the price is 6ooo?
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:25:06
My belief is that one day Bitcoin will be at the very least 25,000 so 5x this 5k the wire fee is about 40 bucks so I don't think I'm going to worry about $30 diff, I use gdax to trade the ratio between this and my eth stack
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:56:05
!Remind me 5 months 29 days
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:37:45
That is not the symbol for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:07:24
Dont do it. In 2014 i sold 100 bitcoin for 20,000 to pay off my car. Since then i have only been able to accumulate less than 10% of what i originally had
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:25:52
more than a dozen
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:45:26
I'm humbled by your response,  thank you.
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:44:17
Fuck these guys specially the bike and carriage, $5/minute 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:45:19
Dude just called Bush it s*** on all the trend analysis it's useless in crypto even support levels that time after time and stock markets have proven too old to not hold here resistance levels either their jokes
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:48:52
Wrong again
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:54:42
Something called local Bitcoins and something else called the venmo greed blinds you that was like 30% of my stack
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:06:18
Freaking banksters
@_date: 2017-10-04 17:57:35
Its also eyeing, $1000 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:16:00
Thank you I will definitely grow from this and become a better man
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:51:53
Wrong again
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:16:45
This exactly, I will never make the same mistake again I deposited $5,000 in ACH transfer and the money didn't arrive for about 7 days including the weekend what happened was that ethereum was 42 bucks and then the shot up to 72 never making that same mistake
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:15:02
Spend and replace (tm) - Ascends 2017.
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:14:26
Wrong 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:18:27
Yes, I was driving when I bought, clicked 3 buttons to buy this amount.
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:42:06
Damn dude I feel ya, I lost 4.15 btc recently to a scammer. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:09:18
Dont listen to this noob dude how can you compare a 4 to 6% deductible intetest rate to historical 50 to 400% gains in crypto... if anything casg out 5% a year... each year the 5% will be worth more and more... your mortgage payment in crypto last month would get you .3 btc now it gets you .15 half.. in 1 month....
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:13:12
Wrong again, it compiles to the right, wow you were not right about always being wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-10 22:40:21
Welp if it goes to 4k will buy more 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:05:41
it is now homie
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:25:18

@_date: 2017-10-11 18:01:34
Less than I've made.
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:26:25
same but were back at 41xx sucks dude
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:04:46
Bought this on my phone while at the beach enjoying the day.
I have a incoming transfer on gdax going to DCA down prices dipping a bit
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:13:28
funny but not true, i can still buy 2 mcdoubles for $2.50, yesterday, today, and hopefully until bitcoin reach $10,000, then when bitcoin is $1,000,000 per 1 mcdouble will be $150
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:16:56
Yes because he does exist and though he is a fraud himself has the ability to reach multitudes
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:15:22
This I did this I took out one of those credit cash advances last year from my credit card about 20,000 and it was a 3% fee but no interest for 12 months I'm coming up on the 12th month and I've nearly tripled my money
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:55:13
you had fiat in the exchange already?
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:16:20
Welcome to the list.
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:49:05
You get both but without replay protection you need to have a really really careful tolerance otherwise you'll lose both coins are you now getting the gravity of the situation?
If you transact one BTC from Legacy chain to 2x chain and you don't do it correctly you will lose your BTC and instead of having two you will have none
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:20:38
I heard some other guy on here say PNC was blocking his buys, has that happened to you? I've been buying with bank of america since 2013 never had any issues except last month they put a 10 day hold on a check (from a business account) it was for $100 lol so didn't mind the wait but banks are getting scared? Coinbase is FDIC insured
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:23:28
Nearing my DCA 
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:39:06
Bcash had replay protection 2x does not. 2x people want their coin to be the real bitcoin even at a cost of burning down the whole operation
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:04:22
CHEAPSIDE GBR, it just means that coinbase doesn't have to pay the outrages 10% sales tax here in california. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:37:33
 guy would have had 2.2 billion, now he has $150 USD, TOP 3 haven't changed bitcoin amounts in 2 years
