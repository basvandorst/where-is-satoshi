I think it makes you seem hip/intelligent.  Those that don't follow bitcoin might shake it off, but those that do will find it real neat.

With a verified US account, how long could you anticipate a withdrawal currently taking?

Understood, but that still doesn't address the original question.  Bitcoins, at some rate, will continue to be "lost".  Eventually, there must be no bitcoins, no?

On a macro level of potentiality, this is still the "ground floor".  That means high risk, high reward, by it's very nature.  Is it ever smart to invest a significant amount of your money in something high risk/high reward?
That's subjective.  
EDIT: For the record, I'm "heavily invested" (as far as percentage of net worth goes).  That said, I find the long term risk at the current price lower than I assume most others (though maybe not others in r/bitcoin).

I ended up using Coinbase.  Sold ~25 btc, withdrew to checking account.  Money was in checking account in about 24hrs, serious.

Thank you.  So say I have a public key with 5 btc, and someone sends another 5 btc to that public key.  Do I have a different private key then associated with that public key?
It's sounding like "bitcoin address" is the same as "public key/address".  Is that accurate?

Just what we need.  Stoners dragging along in bitcoin tees.

ok... that's funny.

Am I the only one amazed that ONLY $5,700, at least known, was taken via this security flaw?  Talk about the community coming together for action quickly...

I like btcquick.com , they do 7%.

What are they going to steal from him?  BTC out of his van?

I guess bitcoins are divisible enough that it's just not a short term thing to be concerned with.  Still, it holds theoretically that eventually they'd all be lost.
