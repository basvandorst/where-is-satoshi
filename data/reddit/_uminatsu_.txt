Hi I am also interested how this tipping works. Thanks!

It would make sense if Coinbase becomes so successful that most of the Bitcoin transactions occur offchain, between Coinbase users, at a frequency many times higher than the ~7TPS limit. It is even perceivable in that case that Coinbase market cap could exceed Bitcoin's total market cap.

My observation: Coinbase always gets you the exact BTC amount for BUY and SELL, but the dollar amount may fluctuate depending on exchange rate. For example if I ask to buy 0.12345678 BTC, I'll get exactly 0.12345678 BTC.
Circle does the opposite: it always gets the exact DOLLAR amount for BUY and SELL, but the BTC amount may fluctuate. It is quite annoying, for example if you have 0.5 BTC on your Circle account, it is impossible to sell exactly all of that amount. You'll always end up with something like 0.0000215 BTC left over after the sell.

is there a higher level than "novice"? I'm at least 20 games completed but still at novice level

Thanks and I have much respect to your efforts.

It is really basically by brute force -- pick words at random and try until the checksum is valid.

anyone with the computing power to crack this wallet (~0.8 BTC) can probably better spend his effort to mine a block (~25 BTC)

I'm curious what is the final passphrase? I tried all normal chars and some unicode symbols. But my computer was too slow.

I see it is revealed, thanks and congratulations!
"♥" is unicode 0x2665 (9829 in decimal) so at the speed of my computer it will take a few years to get there... so I didn't really have a chance anyway

I'm afraid that this is still not quite crackable even with your hint.
You need:
(1) pick 3 out of 25 possible characters (may repeat): 25^3 = 15,625
(2) pick 1 Unicode character (possibly 100,000+ choices if you just consider the Basic and Supplementary Multilingual Planes)
Total search space = 15,625 * 100,000+ * 4 &gt; 6 billion
With the "cracking tool" we're looking at a few hundred thousand attempts per day (that's already with a very powerful computer). So it will take a decade or more.

Thanks for doing this and please keep up the good work. Best wishes!

QR codes already have built-in error correction.

Because that 1 unicode character has 4 possible positions in the 4-character passphrase.
