We can't be all "yay a revoluationary decentralised currency that can't be touched by the government or corporations, to the moon! this is going to change the world and give the power back to the people!" and then go crying to the government when one of those people steals your money. It's one or the other.

Finally someone who gets it... It's called trend following and it's an extremely robust method of trading that has worked in every market for the last 100 years. Fuck all that though right? Just hodl til the bitter end.

Yeh nah Authy wanted me to "share to Facebook" that I just set up 2 factor authentication. Professionalism went straight out the window with that. Stick to google authenticator and just back up the setup keys in an encrypted database saved to the cloud, like KeePass.

This reads like a wine taste review. On the nose, higher notes of custard with meaty pan juices, with darker edges of black pudding and asphalt underneath. A chewy and succulent palate with a continuum of assorted flavours and textures make for a tightly woven mouth feel with a twist of elongated tannins. Therefore buy bitcoin! 
Here's a tip, but if the price is going up, sell if it's going down. Who'd have thought that could be profitable??
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:56:23
Lol yeah everything bad about Bitcoin is either FUD or actually a good thing and everything good is still good. A lot of people are disconnected from reality.

It's your own fault for basing your entire investment strategy on a misspelled internet meme. Somewhat knowledgeable investors sell when the value of an asset begins to drop. Hundreds of thousands of people are getting burned because of that HODL fuckwit.

Could have multiplied your holdings many times over using a proper strategy, but each to his own.

Trend following trading isn't predicting the future. All the top hedge funds that have survived for decades do so by not predicting markets, they react to them. Price is the only true indicator, if it's going up then buy, if it's going down then sell. You'll protect your capital in situations like recently, and profit in the big trends upward. Doesnt that make sense? If you prefer to wear your shittin' pants holding all the time then go for it.

What kind of shitty currency can be so easily manipulated?
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:59:30
Or you can sell when it drops 10%, continues to drop by 40%, then buy back in when it starts going up again but that's none of my business!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:38:48
It's hard to be wrong when the price has gone up 1000%. Try technical analysis on the Forex market and see how it works out for ya!

Even if the fees are as low as 50c, it's still too much. How low can it go while keeping it economically viable for miners to bother running their hardware?

Authy wanted me to share to Facebook that I just set up 2 factor authentication, fuck that shit. Deleted it straight away. Perhaps its just me, but I find that super unprofessional for security software. Went back to google authenticator and just saved my encrypted 2FA keys somewhere safe.

Wrong, that's being predictive... Trend following does not aim to predict market movement, it responds to it. Dunn capital has a 45 year track record of profitability from systematic trend following. See how buying the dips goes for you over 45 years.

If it can be cheaper than 0.5% per transaction it will be competitive with accepting credit cards in my retail store and I'll be happy

That's it, see green buy, see red.. sell. Add in some simple risk management and position sizing and you've got yourself a trend following system. Why buy something that's going down? It makes no fucking sense.

There are a number of different techniques, calculations and time-frames that may be used to determine the general direction of the market to generate a trade signal. these including the current market price calculation, moving averages and channel breakouts. Traders who employ this strategy do not aim to forecast or predict specific price levels; they simply jump on the trend and ride it.

I mean bank to bank transfers are free tho
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:45:12
No. It's called trend following and it's the only trading method that has worked for the past 100 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:42:24
Don't overcomplicate things. Buy if the price is going up, sell if the price is going down.
@_date: 2018-11-06 22:13:24
But its free to transfer between banks bro, and now in Australia we've got a standardized system called payID. It's an instant transfer and you just give someone your mobile phone number. Don't even need to fuck with bank account numbers! It outdoes crypto in practical terms. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:17:29
They're all a bunch of bullshit, but hey guess what! there's one magical indicator that takes into account every variable and combines it all into one simple easy to read number, it's called "The Price". If it's going up, buy. If it's going down, sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:03:29
