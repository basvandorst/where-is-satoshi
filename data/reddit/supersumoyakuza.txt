Are you sure? The bitcoin part of the ad was clearly parody, but they posted an actual complete western Union ad without alteration next to it. This is not so much parody as advert encapsulation within a larger parody work, which would trigger the notice. If they just posted the bitcoin part of the work, they'd not trigger the takedown.

What's your suggested alternative for n00bs?

There's got to be another methodology I can use. I'm not rebuilding my entire site for this.

Many thanks! Research diving now. :-)

This article is a joke. Zero value. Thanks for sharing and adding to the useless background noise on this channel.

Made a purchase of two $100 amazon cards and a $75 amazon card about an hour and a half ago. Bitpay says the transaction has gone through and I have 10 confirmations (so far) on the transaction showing in my wallet.
I didn't realize that the delay could be so substantial. I chose this service because your site implied it would be very fast. I am hoping to get my cards in the next two hours before the shipping cutoff. 
I would appreciate if you added a prominent notice on your site showing the expected transaction time. Will report back here with the resolution and exact time-frame to completion.

I appreciate the speedy service. The transaction completed successfully in about two hours.
Your organization of the page is misleading. 
It says:  




This statement (taken by itself) implies that the only delay is the transaction verification.
Then under that it says 








The organization of your data implies that the 24 hour expected processing time is only for PayPal transactions (which one would expect to be more complex than a gift card). I'm suggesting you make it clear that gift cards also have a 24 hour turn-around time.

Sure. I used bitinstant to set up the transfer from usd cash to mt.gox account. 1/2 hour guarantee. Bitinstant gave me data to take to my local check cashing place. The check cashing place took my cash and the bitinstant transaction number. The USD funds were loaded into my Mt. Gox account, and then i bought bitcoins with that USD balance and i transferred the bitcoins to an anonymous wallet.
