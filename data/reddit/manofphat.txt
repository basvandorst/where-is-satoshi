Very simple, to the point, and encourages further discussion. I like! Thanks for sharing!

I spent 0.1 BTC back in the day just so I could change my username. No regrets. Also, shut-up.

Great idea!

Very well said. Thanks for sharing.

Thanks. A lot of people there talking about bitcoin like it was an investment first and a currency second. I guess I should be glad they aired what I had to say instead.

That's good stuff. When people seem interested but apprehensive I remind them how the internet has transformed the music/movie industry as well as how news is delivered. I'll be adding your post office analogy to my list of internet victories.

Whenever they were setting up their tripods I said, "You don't need all of that stuff to buy bitcoins guys" to which they replied, "Yeah we know. You can buy them online too". It was the first of many of my failed jokes.

I haven't been back since but considering how it's the only one within a four hour radius I'd think it'll get some use.

CaVirtEx has it's place but it takes a long time to get verified and load funds. The BTM is by far the best way for new users to get started. I'll be using the BTM to take quick advantage of the market corrections. The rates at CaVirtEx are $5 to deposit, 1.5% to buy and 1.5% to sell. The BTM is similar.
Right now they don't offer a bitcoin to cash solution but from what I've gathered they're expecting it to be available within the next few weeks.

At the time I purchased the ask price on CaVirtEx was $888. Bitcoin average in CAD was $903. The machine was quoting $930. Here's a video of me doing the first transaction:

I noticed this about a month ago, got drunk and then bought a couple of things. I paid artists to draw me. In this album you'll find the original followed by the artists renditions:

I had a good chuckle. Thanks!

The bitcoin ATMs will be required as long as everyone still gets paid in fiat. ATMs and exchanges will become obsolete when employers start accepting/paying in bitcoin. The price per coin has very little sway on the ATM market. If anything, fluctuations should be driving more ATM volume.

I didn't know I was going to be on TV. I told the reporter that I wish I trimmed my beard today and he said not to worry because it makes me look like a man.

Sorry to hear about your husband. The normal way to go about selling your bitcoins would be to join an exchange and sell them there. One of the big ones is Bitstamp. Check this page out for more info:

I spoke for five minutes about bitcoin and this is what they chose.

She's right. I put a bunch of money into that machine and all I walked away with was a t-shirt. You can't explain that.

*THAT SIR* is because I'm a jerk. I've modified my comment. Thanks for pointing it out.
