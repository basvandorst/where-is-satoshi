OK sweet. Thanks

Yeah some of the reviews are a bit concerning. 
Is it still safe to transfer coin atm with all the change happening today if I get airbitz?

I make a new account every 2 months for privacy reasons. What the hell can/would a shill do here anyway?
I was simply wondering why the long wait for transactions to go thru and I thought people here might have an idea if there was a backlog or something like that.
One has finally been confirmed to poloniex but I can't remember a time when I've ever had to wait that long, that is why I thought I'd ask. 
But fuck me, right?

My coins are in Mycelium, is this just as good as breadwallet or should I transfer to bread?

It's all good now. Transactions have been confirmed.

Check spam. That's where mine went when I changed ISP's and had a new IP

Yes I realise that, but I have no idea of the hold up

And of course I have the Tx's. Why?

This is bullshit. Over 120 mins to transfer a small amount of btc and still no confirmation. 
Another I made over 30 mins ago isn't even in the fucking blockchain yet.

New account. What's that got to do with it?
