Although I love what they're doing I got a negative response there because I said we should hold a lottery for a needy family for Christmas. Really turned me off that sub. It's a random pick that could easily go to someone that doesn't even need the money when families are doing without this Christmas.

Was this post removed and I'm just not seeing it as such? Sorry. Again I'm mainly on mobile so that doesn't show.

"$50,000 isn't a lot of money"
You and I have are obviously experiencing different levels of life.

Need to be a little more specific.  
Does she work during the evening?
Do you work during the evening?  
Give me just a little more information.  
@_date: 2014-09-20 02:43:21
must have missed that? Is it active? I couldn't find it through searching.  
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:22:57
Exactly plus I think for those who aren't aware of how easy it is to jailbreak when someone mentions jb'ing it's like asking them to climb Mt. Everest. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:55:47
I honestly don't think this will hurt Apple at all. Sorry. If you want an app for it then build it. Cydia is always an option and as easy as it is to jailbreak now there's no reason you shouldn't be jailbroken already. Hell I'd build the app if I truly believed it was worth the time.  
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:04:56
I've been involved with the jailbreaking community since the beginning and I've never had a problem. I'll tell you like I tell everyone else whom had concerns: be smart and trust the big names. Many people have worked many years to gain respect within the jb'ing community and these are the ones you can trust. Jailbreaking is like anything else. Do your homework, watch videos, read forums and follow the instructions. I've never seen an iPhone that couldn't be revived from a bad jailbreak (bricked). Trust me it's not rocket science and even though Apple says there is security issues (so that you'll update to the newest iOS) I've not seen any problems.

I wonder how much PayPal actually ends up with, yearly, from fees taken due to suspicious buyer disputes way after the purchase? 
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:51:51
Android has a few that are nice. The main goal for me is providing something that has a demand, is user friendly and consistent with updates. 
Unfortunately I can't say the app will be free but it won't be unreasonable. Money is a little tight right now so I might open the beta up, when I get to that point, with a donation page. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:54:48
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:08:58
Actually I did. The gentleman deleted his comments due to it being personal. I consider helping 1 person a success.  
@_date: 2014-09-16 01:36:59
I offered my services for this project yesterday as well. I'll be starting a crowd funding page in a few days to get the ball rolling. Maybe we can work together?
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:24:51
I wasn't aware of anything on Cydia that is actually user friendly. The one I have seen is very "shady" looking and not something I'd trust with my information. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:39:02
This doesn't stop anything. All it does is delay the option. Those of us who use an iPhone are well aware that the jailbreak community has proven if there's a need there will be a release.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:46:13
In my opinion, basically this. 
A CEO pitches new clients on the numbers of previous deals and fake numbers. To the new client everything looks great so said client signs up and invests with the CEO. Later the client tries to withdraw his initial investment but is unable to because the funds have already been shifted or spent and aren't available. Ponzi scheme 101. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:23:53
You have a very valid and probably correct point. BC is not the only digital currency around nor is it Apples only option. Why would Apple spend all their time removing BC apps if they planned on accepting them within the next few months? 
I'd put my money on Apple creating some type of currency of their own that users can use for IAP or for other iDevices. 
If not then I bet those who smashed their phones wish they would've waited.  
@_date: 2014-09-05 02:26:40
I'm in this boat too. Have no idea. But I have a wallet.

So you sleep while she's at work?
OK. Try this. Make Monday all about her. Be awake when she leaves for work. Kiss her a few more times than normal. Make her breakfast before she leaves. Then get some sleep but set your alarm for 45 minutes before she gets home. When you wake up go to the store and get her flowers, dinner and a good book (if that's what she's in to). Spend the rest of the night not thinking about the work you'll have to make up on Tuesday but the life you'll lead with this wonderful woman who has chosen to pick you out of all the other men in the world. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:08:58
Yea. The z10 is miles above many of the phones that just came out. Not to mention Blackberry is known for their strength in security. That's why I thought it would be a given that Bitcoin users would like BlackBerry 
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:49:05
I'm happy that Bitcoin is growing as much as the next person but are people forgetting that we are talking about PayPal here? PayPal has one of the worst reputations but everyone here is acting like PayPal is god. 
I'm not trying to be negative people but remember how bad PayPal has been screwing over people for many years. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:59:14
I've posted this same question with success in the past. Why am I receiving hate for offering help, advice or an open ear to a fellow Bitcoin Redditor?  
@_date: 2014-03-08 14:34:06
Please remember that iPhones can be jailbroken and used in whatever way you wish. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 22:34:47
VIRTUAL currency. Bitcoin is not virtual. Come on guys.
@_date: 2014-09-16 10:21:05
Maybe not but if I don't we can use it for the Kickstarter page if you'd like. 
The KS campaign will be to fund not only the video but the placement on TV. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:44:48
Sorry if the title was confusing. I'm offering advice for tips. Not for 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:56:20
Would work but again not user friendly. Ease of use is key with most. Open, pay/verify, move on. That's the end game.
@_date: 2014-03-09 03:27:48
Running an app that won't be updated in the future leaves the user stuck with their current firmware and unable to update. Trust me at some point that will get old for the user. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:43:06
Overall a great event for Bitcoin. Great exposure and it showed the ease of Bitcoin through all the tipping that took place. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:21:38
I sent him the information I could "find". Hope it helps. That's one hell of a piece of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 16:42:31
Someone just tipped me and a huge thank you to whoever did! That sound and feeling of the alert was awesome! 
Thanks again stranger!
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:03:07
Sorry. I'm on mobile so I didn't see the sidebar. I've never had a problem with this in the past but I will remove it. 
@_date: 2014-09-09 21:19:11
Yea. That's the information I could find. I PM'd it to Roger because of Reddits rules. Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:02:49
Send it to me and I'll give it to my 10 year old son :) 
@_date: 2014-09-16 16:36:30
Still not a good reason. Obviously the jailbreak community had proved anything is possible with the iPhone. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 05:06:59
Good point but this community has proved to be a strong force for donations when it finds something to get behind. Faith would really be the only source of funding. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:05:39
Still pending in Maryland. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:46:06
I've developed for android as well and I can assure you its not jailbroken out of the box.
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:14:03
Unfortunately I'm on the Blackberry app. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:11:44
I could turn these into an icon set for the iPhone if you'd like? 
Or I could build a Bitcoin iPhone theme if anyone's interested. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:57:14
Awesome stuff bro. Keep spreading the good word.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:19:26
You and I have a different opinion of rich but good on ya my friend. Wish you all the best.
@_date: 2015-05-20 22:04:23
So everyone is just going to pass on his other charges in Maryland? You know, the charge for plotting to kill someone. The charges that are still pending.
Look I get it. I understand the need for the market, I don't agree with some of it but I understand the need. Ross was anything but innocent here. We all know how the government works and yet we act surprised when something like this happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:43:34
Enjoy the ride man! I've watched this train pass me by over the past few years telling myself to put a few bucks in here and there but I didn't due to the financial problems my wife and I have been dealing with. It's a pain in the ass knowing if I would've just moved somethings around maybe I could've had the financial freedom for my kids now or at least not be working 70 hours this week so they can at least have a Christmas tree and a few gifts. 
Good on you for making the jump and never forget to appreciate what you have.
