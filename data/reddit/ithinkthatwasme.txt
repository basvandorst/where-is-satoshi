This article seems to answer some questions
@_date: 2019-07-01 05:38:47
Tldr: according to the statistical model of Regression to Mean Bitcoin will have volatility because it is imperfectly correlated. My take is that the price will continue to go up and down until there is something that can have strong correlation with the price.
Though, I don't think this helps in trying to predict the price either.
Edit: Grammer
@_date: 2019-07-01 05:42:41
Yeah, I agree though as the article points out, it's a weak correlation right now so... Hodl :)

That's like saying if everyone in the world were to flush the toilet at the same time the sewage would take 40 years to process so toilets are broken.
If everyone in the world made a phone call at the same time then it would take 10 years to connect them all so there phone system is flawed.
It's reductio ad absurdum. Capacity is increased as necessary, it's just simple economics, no one is going to spend the resources to make sure that the world can flush the toilet at the same time, just in case.

You should really get a tax lawyer but yeah, tax basis starts the day you inherit.
I think that if you find a legit law firm, that deals in crypto, they will guide you and help you liquidate and perhaps advise you on holding.
Edit: Even if you don't have the cash, I'm pretty sure those firms will take payment in crypto. Just do the research and make sure they are legit.

Oh, there are plenty of rules in the network. Decentralization &lt;&gt; no rules.
Think about it this way, the scientific community can be seen as decentralized but there are plenty of rules that everyone agrees to follow. Anyone can choose to run an experiment however they like and it could be some revolutionary discovery but they will have to convince the rest of the community that their method was better.
The people that follow the existing protocol won't have to do that.
Though, there is no central authority telling scientist what to do, they can study whatever they want.
Same goes for Bitcoin. Anyone can do whatever they want but it doesn't mean that it will gain any traction. Ie. Forks.

This article, which quotes an oped that actually cites no sources from people who actually purchased at a premium, is published by a company that sells miners and offers otc trading.
I see absolutely no conflict of interest here.
@_date: 2019-08-02 11:47:38
It's a crap article with no links to his sources and is full of biased language. Who are the btc owners he refers to? Where did he get those irs letters showing the amounts to be paid? I don't see any language in the letters he shows that reference crypto. I'm pretty sure we would have seen someone here post about receiving a letter from the IRS stating they owe an specific amount. So far, the only reports are just the 3 variations.
@_date: 2019-10-04 17:22:15
If the firmware was not signed by Satoshi labs it would have given him a warning prompt when the trezor booted.
I'm not sure how the op would not have noticed this...
@_date: 2019-08-02 17:54:55
Yeah, those are the 3 variations of the warning letter I mentioned. We know that, its old news. 
This crap article makes the "IRS proposed amount due" letter the main topic and uses it as a primary basis to assume people are desperate. Except there is nothing substantiating the claims. What is the source? Where are the links to the 4chan posts? Who said they were desperate?
The article would get an F in a high school journalism class.
Edit: changed scared to desperate, just overlooked it.

That already exists, crypto loans. You usually have collateralized loans at 50% of the current value... There are more than a few companies out there now.
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:38:25
The way I see it, is that even if demand stays the same those people will continue to buy regardless of the price but just get less btc for the same amount they were willing to spend.
So that still causes a shortage as btc gets purchased. This drives prices up and the cycle repeats.
@_date: 2019-08-22 01:55:00
According to this
50-75% of America have a household income of about $50k (or less) to 110k a year. My guess is that at this income level, most of that population won't have very much extra disposable income to think about investments beyond whatever might be in their 401k. 
Since Bitcoin isn't yet something that can be easily utilized in daily transactions then I don't think that many of those people would invest their time in learning about how and why Bitcoin is so revolutionary. Most won't need to transact globally or have any need to move large sums of money. I'm guessing they pretty much live paycheck to paycheck.
If they don't buy Bitcoin they may have lost in the gain but it didn't actually cost them anything either. You could argue that it would cost them in the future but honestly, how many people really think that far ahead?
Outside of the American population my guess is that the picture doesn't look too much different.
What happens when 25-40% of everyday brick and mortar merchants start to accept crypto as payment? I don't know, maybe that's a tipping point for mass adoption. We have a lot of issues to tackle before that though, taxes, speed, ease of use.
I know someone in the semi conductor tech industry that majored in finance which I've introduced to Bitcoin when it was $10 and they still didn't take a gamble (from his perspective) with just a small amount but would still spend thousands gambling at a casino. When it was at $200 he told me that they had a team that was dedicated to crypto hardware research. Still didn't buy any. If someone like that didn't see the necessity to adopt then how do we reach the average person? 
I don't have any answers except... 42.

I think this is typical for residential or commercial service in larger cities where consumption usually varies from day to day. The power companies forecast the amount of power necessary for any given time and generates/purchases what it needs, then sells any excess to other providers.
So, anyone using more than the average will get charged at a higher tier because it would technically cost the power company more. 
Large miners can negotiate directly with the power companies because they have the buying power to do so and can guarantee a consistent usage.

Hum let me revise... Likely, a statistically significant amount of people who own Bitcoin, drive. Bitcoin causes driving!

I'm going to say that there is a correlation between people that drive cars with people that own Bitcoin because I'm pretty sure that the majority of people who own Bitcoin drive cars.

Yup, good thing about btc is that we aren't suck with whole units. The same person that wanted to spend 8k on one btc can still buy 0.95 or whatever...
The buyers never really get priced out because they don't have enough for a whole coin.

@_date: 2019-06-28 00:00:10
The study is based on the stock market. This makes the correlation hugely irrelevant as it's completely different economic mechanics between crypto and stocks.
If the study was about commodities then maybe it would have just a little more relevance, otherwise pure fud. 
Otoh a study finds that most people who use btc drive, therefore driving causes btc adoption.

Well, June high was about 13k, down 44% is

The DNM might have made an impact years ago when the price was well below $100 but there is no way it is making any impact on the trading volume of 18.7 billion in just the past 24 hours.
Unless you are saying that the majority of this volume is generated by drug trading?
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:54:58
Going from that rationality, they wouldn't hold at all. As soon as they get btc, they would sell it. They would never have any large amounts stashed and have even less impact on the market.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:00:25
Then the costs shift to another resource, the cost of hardware, cost of space to house them, maintenance, network infrastructure, etc. As designed, when more miners get put online the difficulty increases so no more btc get mined even with free energy.
If energy actually gets cheaper or even becomes free in 25 years, I think it will be a gradual shift and so the cost of mining equilibrium will stay relatively constant.
There would only be some sort of market impact of perhaps a large group of miners all of a sudden get free power and then get an advantage over those paying for power. Even then, it would be against those miners self interest if they dumped their coin and pushed down the price. Assuming they acted rationally, they would only sell what they needed to pay for expenses and to meet what they feel would meet the optimal demand.
In short, nothing much would change. It would still cost lots of money to mine.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:39:29
What does this have to do with Bitcoin?
At least you can say something like you mine Bitcoin with the buses too or you accept Bitcoin for payment at your charging stations... 
Even just glue a Bitcoin Miner too the top of a bus or put stickers on them just to have some relevance for posting this here.
Oh I know, you use wind scoops on your buses to generate extra wind power too run miners on your vehicles and use that Bitcoin to pay for school lunches!

So the estimate is 1 billion of volume over the year in a market of over 20 billion over the last 24 hours.
Take the 1b clandestine yearly volume and calculate for 1 day makes 2.7 million.
That's .0135% of the volume, that's if all the drug dealers dumped their total 2.7 million at one time.

I haven't done profitability calculations in a long time but it goes like this... 
Return on investment in about 6-9 months. So theoretically that's the 1250 btc in pocket. (They could sell futures to lock in the price)
Another few months worth of mining before hardware is obsolete making about 125 more coins.
By the time the hardware is EOL they have 1250+125=1375 BTC
If they just bought 10m in BTC by the end of the year they still have 1250 btc. 
It's profitable especially if you are a manufacturer of the miners and your resources are cheaper than your competition. So you are able to set up more miners, getting a higher hash rate at the same cost as someone somewhere else.
Of course that's not factoring that the miners burn down.
