They are Bitcoin transactions, the aggregate of which must be settled on the main chain
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:26:38
LOL sounds like some kind of shitty walled garden. Wonder what Bitcoin stuck in their system will be worth. I'm guessing less than gox coins
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:16:41
Centralisation is excessive right now any less than 20,000 nodes is rediculous

@_date: 2017-03-30 03:48:26
Yeah interesting one, so its worth studying but not worth owning. 
However if no one thought it was worth owning, then it would have no value, and then it certainly wouldn't be worth studying.
Maybe like having an Egg, and having never heard of a chicken, the egg might be worth studying, but not owning. Cos who would just buy an egg.
I'll be by later to pick up my random analogy award.

Ditching bitcoin was probably the circle plan all a long. The basically wanted a group that would jump on any new bitcoin related tech and start using it thereby helping kick start the business.
This is probably why their business is not called coinbase or bitpay, it's circle which doesn't have anything to do with crypto.

What's interesting is that as soon as one coin becomes "the other coin" the question is then about what you do with that coin. Either hold it sell it. There is never a discussion about what you do with your Bitcoin ay? That's cos you'll never sell your Bitcoin. Which is why all these forms are doomed to languish in forever-shitter-than-the-one-true-coin-land
What I'm saying is the mere fact of you discussing one coin as the "other" means that it has already failed in becoming "the Bitcoin". Good job sir.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:35:31

I'm pretty eager to sell all my BCH and I'm assuming none of the exchanges are accepting BCH deposits as the chain they accept on will be wiped out when Bitmain dumps their chain on the network.
How will we know when the 3 day mined chain has been dumped on the network?

Nah man, you could look at it as a charity thing, but as a crypto user it helps strengthen and secure the network and selfishly that means that the small stash I hodl are more valuable

I reckon he doesn't understand lightening network, because it doesn't make the price higher. 
It means we can have trillions of offchain instant micropayments and payment channels. Which should increase bitcoins use and utility and then have the effect that more people use it and the price goes higher

If bitmain refuse to upgrade to disable ASICBoost then it becomes clear that they are then using it and have lied when saying they haven't. 
This means it's much easier for me and I imagine the community as a whole to come together and "route around this problem" to quote Andreas.
How we route around I'm not too sure, but I wonder if we could polish UASF to the point where enough core Bitcoin engineers sign off on it and then get that deployed to the ecosystem.

As a long term patron of BBC news, I hate to say it but it is actually a shell of what it once was. This is due to funding cuts over the years by the conservatives.

No wait, I'm holding like I have done since 2011
@_date: 2017-05-28 01:48:32
You buy and hold. That's an investment that makes the currency worth more which creates more interest and then more buyers, then more liquidity, then more use cases then the more people buy in as there is more investment

Doesn't matter what you think about your users.
What you should do, the right thing to do, is give them the information and let them make the choice.
Just like ethereum did with the fork.

Yeah sorry the point I was alluding to was that when 2 things are exchanged that do not have a USD component, how is the USD generated to pay that tax?
Let's say I trade a carrot for a potato. Same question
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:12:28
Predicting Bitcoins demise is a bad idea. It's also impossible to say "please don't fork bitcoin". I agree with the author that forking Bitcoin should not also be done lightly. I also don't think we need to consider hard forking any time soon. Maybe surviving hard forks is next on Bitcoins survival bucket list.

Your stats/post is just argumentative and full of agenda. I'm not connecting to myself. I ran a full node with a 200 connection max limit and I got 85 connections. There's the bandwidth I used. I'm not a home bitcoin user I provide Bitcoin services in my country.

Collect tax from selling one coin only works if you sell to Fiat. Why not sell one coin for the other coin?

Money = information = speach. 
So its unethical not to allow someone a bank account when they are not doing criminal activities. Its monopolistic behavior.
In many places its illegal to cut off the water supply, banks should be the same.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:03:47
Interesting as always. Could also explain the rise in the value of litecoin which already has segwit enabled. 
If the market continues to decide that litecoins potential uses are more beneficial to more people then I suppose we could expect the price of litecoins to continue to rise.

How about we look at stability in terms of uptime. Like my bank goes down at 5pm every day and doesn't come back up until 9am. Not to mention I've had 2 different banks close my account due to Bitcoin. So for me Fiat currency is the volatile one.

This article is stupid.


First off he doesn't understand the point of crypto, as this is not it.
Second, just because Bitcoin gives you control of your own money doesn't mean that everyone stops paying tax. 
As a sole trader I earn money and then tell the government how much I earned then pay tax on that amount. Same thing will apply to crypto.
Next article will be about how blockchain will increase the deathrate or some shit. I won't be reading

Think about it, having a lot of hash rate in a single user is as bad as having not much hash rate. The hash rate distribution is as important as the actual hash rate itself. So if the POW alg is changed then everyone starts from the baseline, us, the feds, and Jihan. That's a good thing as far as hash distribution is concerned.
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:54:39
