Your Bitcoin average will be soon 6k once it breaks thru this year's low
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:12:17
Just went back down again

I make my financial decisions based on logical deductions not on guesswork and gut feelings/false hope. If 9 out of 10 is bearish then maybe they are onto something. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 10:24:03
Still bearish on charts
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:42:16
There's the pump guys!! Now sell the rallies!! 
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:11:41
And sell rallies
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:58:02
Won't hold, last time it went there it made new lows. This time will make lower lows than that coz only one month did complete U turn. Expect it to bleed crazy

How is that manipulation when the order didn't go through and therefore have no impact on price
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:12:47
Yep support at 6k not going to hold long

There's a name for this behaviour. It's called gambling.

As with Bitcoin being secure. Maybe too secure to be a good thing. Cyberhacks, forgotten password and stolen offline wallet then your money is gone for good. If I leave it in bank, it's like having a security guard guarding my money. Isn't that better?

Buying Bitcoin with credit is potentially a path to homeless

Pretty sure whales have been selling btc today with big drop like that in last 24 hrs
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:01:11
An even better day for the environment!! 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:21:29
Or maybe there is no market manipulation at all and this reflects the a more accurate price of btc
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:20:40
Most unlikely a rise. My bet it will go down to 5000

He is saying neither buy, sell or hold. He is saying if U got cash to NOT buy on fomo
@_date: 2018-07-02 06:34:50
Looks like will bleed back to 6k
@_date: 2018-07-01 01:09:55
Don't believe too much in theorycrafting, the trend is your best friend and this is a bear market. Proceed with extreme caution when buying. Best to sell rallies (short sell)

Spreads so bad. It's like exchanging fiat at airport.
