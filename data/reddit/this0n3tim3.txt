No, gold doesn't just look pretty :) Gold, and various other metals, are present everywhere in for example technology.
Gold and various metals have certain properties, which gives them certain use-cases.

I can't say I know to what extent gold is being used in practice.
But still, so? You stated "it just looks pretty". That's inaccurate. They have real use-cases, to a much larger degree than Bitcoin currently has, or in the future probably will have.

Ah ok, yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:16:41
True dat. I just don't see how a physical store of value which has been around for thousands of years would suddenly be made irrelevant to such a degree that perhaps then we need to be talking about. Perhaps for a short term, as has obviously happened to gold time and time again. But long term... Who knows, maybe. 
Consider the vulnerability of the internet in a situation of real crisis.

Just put a hole in your cellar somewhere, seal again so that it looks like it did before. If I had the money, I'd definitely buy a bar of gold to hide away somewhere.

Volume spread is starting to look better again than previous of and beginning of the dip. Perhaps doesn't say much, but demand(in relation to the time-frame we are talking about) to sell is diminishing in percentile numbers in relation to demand to buy.
This is just a basic calculation I've made from 4 of the largest exchanges, it might be wrong. And numbers can change again.

What are you going to use the money for? If you wanna have a yacht, hodl. If you wanna pay of your debts, and can do that, maybe sell. Decide your perspective. I want money for a future project so I can work without needing someones handouts and not having to work a regular job while going for my dream. I would sell half of that amount, hodl the rest. Congrats by the way :)

Yes, but it was a fcking great crusade though. Probably not for those on the beach though, as you imply. I've just been on the sidelines for all these years, but now I'm in it with you guys, let's take wall street on for real. Not with the banners and shit crying about how unfair it all is, but with hard cold cash. I've not got much, only 2000usd in Bitcoin, but that's 75% of my assets, and my future is pretty secure nowadays anyway financially. This is the big gamble. Bring it futures and coldhearted traders who don't give shit about who you take the money from, I'm fcking looking forward to this. 
(Some roleplay I suppose, but still, let's have some fun.).

This was actually mindblowing in a certain way. I was buying something over the internet today with my creditcard, and it was such a hassle. Then I see this. Ok. I get it.

Aslam at TF Global Markets said he’s not seeing an increase in demand to short bitcoin.
“Right now as of this minute, the race is still to the upside,” he said.
But who knows.

I sold my shit on 12600, thinking it had to drop. No, it doesn't, at least no right now, and for various reasons I can't buy in the next 10 hours. I'm watching the charts, and it's insane. People are dropping 100's of coins, and they just get swallowed. There has to be huge players coming into the market. But I don't know, I've only been invested since 9.5 so.
In the future I will not try to time the market. I'll hodl til I feel I can sell and not buy back in.

Regulations are necessary. I'm happy they are regulating. What do you think the alternative to regulation is, in any case? Yes, a ban. Governments will never allow a currency completely out of their control, and neither should they.

I don't have a smartphone. I guess, I'm really not up to date with current technology in certain ways. Might be the reason I find it so amazing.

When I read this I came to think of a Monk in India who studied with Dalai Lama for many years and eventually opened an orphanage for unwanted children, in Himalaya. They are completely dependent upon donations and it's the real deal. There is even a documentary about it, which I highly recommend. I'll contact them to email you.
I wrote a previous post, thinking the orphanage was located in Nepal, but I had mixed it up with Himalaya in general.

Ehh, haha. My god. I didn't even understand what you were talking about first. But no, I'm not quoting the guy from Breaking bad
I love the "A philosophical quote isn't a counter to the joke of your logic" haha. Would you mind explaining that more in-depth? Because I think you would have a hard time doing so. Unless, of course, you would like to contradict yourself.

I guess this is what they apparently call the flashback. I never really understood what they meant, but I guess this is it.

Your maximum upside is not 100% I'm pretty sure. If you buy a short for 5k when the current price is 10k, and then the price is 40k on the date of the future "expiring", then that is 4x the money when you bought the future, and 8x the money on the date itself. :)

Mm ok. Well yes, I agree. Most of the posts in this subreddit is a waste of time if you want to get informed, and many do seem to have an almost religious attitude in relation to Bitcoin. There is relevant information to be found however, and a lot of the apparent fanaticism I think is more of a conscious choice and almost a joke in a certain way. Still, I'd prefer if this subreddit was more like the eth one:)
The quote I added, I just added because it's one that I like. Not to neither prove or disprove anything actually, it just somewhat fit into the context, so, why not.

It's quite amazing. The balls they have to try and patent stuff like that. It's as if something an 11 year old student came up with.
This is a sign that some banks are getting desperate. For all these years they haven't had a clue, while all the time talented people have been working in the shadows.
