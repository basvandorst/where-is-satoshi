I think scalability problem was solved when bitcoin was created but no one will want to admit that. We know who profited from blocking Bitcoin’s growth at 1MB block size....
The answer is: whoever is creating LN and Liquid, (1.5 layer and 2nd layer) .....����... it will be a miracle if my comment is not deleted from here...

Usage requirments dont outpace Moors law, Moors law doesn’t stop an it is not going to stop. Yours are just assumptions. Idk where you get these ideas. We have more bandwidth then we ever had and don’t know what to do with it because it is cheaper then ever! And it is getting cheaper! 
Second, exactly why wouldn’t you have your data on the blockchain? For example this would stop Facebook and other social media from sending you adds based on preferences they calculated from stealing your data and selling it to company’s, why wouldn’t you sell your data directly and have the company that wants to send you adds PAY TO YOU DIRECTLY? Yes, pay in micropayments directly every time they want to send you a stupid commercial! This is another idea but it is essentially what PEER TO PEER means and only one example of what bitcoin can do! Why do you say people will fill it with crap like that would matter? Bitcoin is more powerful then you think. It doesn’t need your protection and worrying what people will put there. Imagine a world of smart contracts, legal, medical, etc information attached to your identity on bitcoin. All of this can happen with bitcoin. Now you tell me why not? 
Third, what do you mean it’s not economically feasible? For whom? If you are trying to make everyone a miner you are living in a fairytale because that will never happen! We just can’t agree there. Besides if you have too many miner no matter what they won’t add value to the network and won’t earn shit. Miners need to be incentivized! This is the idea that bitcoin originally started with, not “everyone runs a node” bullshit!

I think the crucial point we don’t agree on is that you have to make it friendly for everyone to be a miner which I don’t agree with. 
It will never be centralized because there are about 40 million millioners in this world currently (i think this the right number but not 100 percent sure) a small portion of these people can invest in mining. Even if it is 100 big miners it’s still not centralized, I see mining as business and that’s why I think it should be incentivized. This will lower the price for users and make the system more efficient! 
Remember these people only aim to replace central banks that are issuing money but unlike FED (FED refuses to be audited) they are have to be 100 percent transparent to secure the network and they are pumping money only through an algorithm (unlike FED which serves itself). 
Regarding Moors law I’ll not argue any more because there are also scientists with evidence to show that we don’t have to worry about this in the next 100 years or so. But I’ll not argue because this is not my expertise. I just see bandwidth costing less and less every year so it is just logical for me.

Why would resistance to attacks be compromised with larger block size? Now you finally have a chance to prove your points on BSV, please try and compromise BSV network .. when I say you I mean everyone who makes that claim not just you personally... all of you have a chance to prove your point.
Second, there is no independence from large organizations anyway, these organizations will serve as miners just like Satoshi envisioned. Remember they are incentivized to protect the network and make your transactions as a user as cheap as possible. If we are talking BTC I think these “organizations” have already found a way to centralize development of bitcoin around one fucking company and one fucking idea... so let’s not talk like BTC development is not centralized. Bigger nodes = more money, more money = even more and more money. You think LN will not centralize around big hubs?

Conspiracy nutjob crap �� ... 
...but if you actually look at LN it’s the exact replica of THE CURRENT BANKING MONETARY SYSTEM where opening a payment channel is equivalent to opening a bank account!

You need to pay to open a channel, no? To who are you paying? 
Routing path is just another name for “middle man” on the path . I have a problem with this because it is not bitcoin anymore, it is not peer to peer. You are kicking miners out of the game but big hubs are okay. Hypocrisy!
