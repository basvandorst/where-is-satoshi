No it's just been along on going thing trying to find away to access my funds so from time to time I start looking for any new post on away to try and retrieve them when I came across a post that some had a similar problem and this isn't the first time I've tried to bring attention to this problem this is just the first time I've found someone with the same problem, blockchain.info acknowledging their problem and them fixing it for another person

There was when I they lost my coins I even have all the tx details from gox and blockchain showing that I sent them from my gox account to my blockchain account this has been a very long process in which I've lost all hope in getting my funds back since no one seems to be able to help

When you Goto a credit union to deposit it is a little different then what is explained and shown.... Next time I go I will try and remember to take a picture of their deposit style slips and send it to you for a sample form.

also be careful with blockchain wallet make sure it syncs I created a new address and sent my coins to it go back to check on them and found the coins in the address but no way to retrieve them without private key

Cool can't wait right now cu only banks around me and I'm a member of one of the cu so I know how some of them are around here and I've only really seen about 3 diff style deposit slips with them and the one alot of ppl should look for is the slip for depositing from a different cu unless ... Like your cu is cu A but I'm at cu B then look for the slip that's not for cu B. a shared deposit slip I guess is what it's called.
