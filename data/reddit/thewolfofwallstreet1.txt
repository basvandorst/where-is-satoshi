r/woooosh are you illiterate?

Basic macro-economics teaches you that alone National Debt is just an arbitrary number.

How does the wallet work, do you have to sign up for a service or can it transfer to an existing one?

Technically Bitcoin has only had 60,705% gain of all time while Litecoin has had a 79,628% gain of all time. This is at current values as well so, we can double our BTC percent to get closer to it's all time high and 6x litecoin to get closer to it's all time high. Theoretically LTC would be a much better investment but it would probably be a lot harder to buy.
*all data is from coinbase charts set to all so it is most likely not accurate

That's an odd way of saying "Yeah I guess you were right, looking at a list of big scary number debts alone does not provide us with any useful information"

Could seasonal temperature changes effect mining participation and be partially correlated with BTC price? It wasn't true for 2017 but that might have been an outlier caused by increased adoption mixed with halving. Idk we'll see what happens this year, I think it's going down again for the holidays and I plan to buy big if it does. Just a theory, a Bitcoin theory.

You ignored everything I wrote. I'm being an asshole because you are trashing my post. Not just illiterate, dumb as well.

Was wondering how it worked

Ill be honest with you, I haven't seen any posts but that may be because I havent been on reddit that long. However if there were a lot, it would mean there are a lot of people excited about them. Are you guys trying to kill the buzz? Maybe you had one near you, but now I have one near me. This is a good thing.
Their practicality is irrelevant, they are advertising for bitcoin. Your average Joe thinks that the bitcoin bubble burst and went away. These machines popping up all over reminds people that it is still alive and well. I live in a relatively wealthy area and these machines could attract new investors. I doubt any of them are going to stop at Stater Bros after buying groceries to pick up some Bitcoin. But, some people might see it and do a little more research about Bitcoin and that's the point.
No wonder the people at r/btc have such negative sentiments about r/bitcoin. From a marketing perspective you have no idea what the fuck you are doing. Lol

Are you a mod or something? If so please tell me what is wrong with posting a picture of a coinstar that allows you to buy bitcoin recently available at a stater bros near me. It's not a repost as I took the picture myself, it's not tagged with inappropriate flair, it's just something I saw that I thought was cool.

I believe in the future of crypto. However, I dont see how it will erase national debt. Also posts like these embarrass the community and I'll tell you why:
Have you ever heard of Debt/Asset ratio? It's a key ratio when evaluating the value of companies and countries. It answers the question of "what portion of Assets does Debt make up?" This gives us information on an entities ability to repay it's debt.
For example in 2018 Googles total liabilities (or debt) was $55.164B. Yikes, that's a lot of money, that must be really bad right? I mean just look at snapchat, they only have $1.540B  in debt. They must be a lot better off right? Well when you consider that google had $232.792B of Assets the conclusion changes. You see Google's Debt/Asset ratio was about 25% meaning that they could easily pay off their Debt if they sold off some Assets. Where as Snapchat had Assets of $2.714B meaning their debt to asset ratio is about 55%. They could still pay off their debt but not as easily. Economists apply these same principles to countries. Just substitute Debt/Assets with Debt/GDP (I'm not sure this is the exact equation but it is something like that).
 Countries go bankrupt when too much of their GDP is consumed by their Debt. Thus they aren't able to pay their bond payments and nobody wants to buy their bonds so they cant finance the country.
Another important indicator of a countries health is the rate of change for its debt compared to the rate of change of its GDP. Snapchat may have more more assets than debt but their debt increases at a rate greater than their assets. This will lead to debt consuming too much of assets.
Think of it like a credit history and uncle sam has a perfect score.
As I stated before, alone Debt is just an Arbitrary number and unless you have something to compare it to you dont get a lot of information. The National Debt Clock is really just used to scare people providing some Circus for politics.
