Credit card fees have actually come down alot.
It's tax that costs more when you pay by card. More earnings must be reported.

Might be different per country. Uber eats and deliveroo is much more damaging with commissions up to 30% on orders that the restaurant has to pay

I'll forgive the offer of a tip and the assumption I want a downpayment etc etc because it seems like you're probably a regular young guy, young people can be a bit rude sometimes. Since your reference career is that of waiting tables and you talk about being yet to buy property you're probably at student age? College? 
Sure there may be some folks like you mentioned (facebook using waiters, that dream to buy a first house). But that's not everyone. 
As for yourself - why so angry? Lost money in bitcoin? 
You really shouldn't put more than 1-2% into something speculative/fun like bitcoin, then you won't be so hurt and angry whenever it goes down for a while. 
Try not to take the price so personally, it's not out to get you it's just bitcoin.

I didn't think I'd have the explain the video... But anyway I guess I do so:
The point of the video is that bitcoin reached various highs throughout it's life, then each time it crashed it eventually peaks again with each peak being higher than the previous peak.
Pick any peak in time along the chart and try to predict that it's the last and final peak ever and it will never peak past that again. In all cases in the past you would have been wrong.
The video makes fun of this little fact.
If you have no confidence in bitcoin, then go short it and have fun.

Better to get 14 coins man, then BTC only needs to go up 10x for the million

And the sun may never rise again, but there it is each morning. That's what they said last time, and the time before that, and the time before that.
This reminds me of a video
