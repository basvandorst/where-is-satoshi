The reason to set the limit is so the fees are astronomical, making Lightning Network sound like a good idea so blockstream can make money. Or you forgetting who you are in business with?
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:37:40
How do you think BTC will make it through? This is the new normal, the whole point was to create a shitload of unconfirmed transactions so people will get scared and accept the lightning network as a solution for the problem caused by the same people offering you that solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:19:51
Adoption reaches peak? Am I reading that right? 0.01% of the world population has a wallet, that's not peak adoption. By the way, what are you adopting? What is the use of BTC if it's not digital cash that you can spend? What can you do with it? I'm shocked.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:22:11
Blockchain indeed is one of the greatest technologies in recent history, bitcoin is just an example of what's possible. When you mix the two up, I can see you get confused and buy into the 'really large hubs handling your transactions are totally not banks and it's really decentralized!' narrative.

So BTC is not a currency meant to be used to pay for stuff? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:27:21
You can't use BTC as a currency, it's a store of value. That's why the transaction fee is so high,you're not supposed to transfer it. If you're looking for a currency with low/no fees and fast confirmation times, bitcoin cash (BCH) is your thing

It's a store of value like the rai stones. Utterly useless.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:15:18
Rai stones were great store of value, a terrible currency. You can't have both, is it a store of value or is it a currency meant to be spend? Why would you spend BTC if in your mind it's only going to increase in value? You're not, you're going to spend fiat an hodl the BTC. Spending it would be to expensive. This makes it useless as a currency for the mass, it only has utility if your transaction involve large sums. Still don't get how it went from peer to peer electronic cash to store of value, useless for 95% of the transactions you make daily.

This is how the future will look like if blockstream gets it's way. If the lightning network was up and running right now, you would be forced to use a middleman for you to pay for shit in an acceptable timeframe and move away from p2p to using a hub that will act as a bank. It's insane.

I sound certain because I can read and think. You guys are weakening out every time the price takes a dive. That tells me you know nothing of where you're throwing money at. It's pure speculation, you don't understand the proposed technology nor its implications on future use.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:51:47
Are you serious? How the hell is a merchant going to trust me for 30 days that I don't back up on my payment? What is stopping me from opening a channel with a coffee shop, they hold a 'tab' for 30 days, and they just have to trust that I don't back up on actual payment on day 29. It's supposed to be trustless, you produce numerous new problems.
That's not how LN is going to work, you will have to open a channel through one of a few large hubs with the coffeeshop, you'll have to deposit BTC to the hub, holding it for you while they keep a tab of what you bought at the coffee shop. When you close that channel or you are spending more than you put in, you pay your tab, increase the BTC or the channel gets closed and the initial BTC you put in, gets transferred to the coffeeshop by the hub. I don't see anything different thank how banks work now. Doing this, enables banks to keep better accounting but does nothing for the rest of us as far as eliminating the middleman, the purpose of the whole thing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:55
I don't think I misunderstood. You'll have to pay these hubs to open channels, opening and closing channels will cost you a hefty fee so you're incentivized to just keep it open. Because there will be only a handful of hubs, I don't see how this is not putting back the middleman while the whole point was to get rid of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:48:46
Yeah there are like 250K+ transactions pending in de mempool, transaction fees are skyrocketing to like ~17$, some people are paying up to $1000 for their transaction to get processed so good luck with that buddy!

Why would you pay for your beer in BTC when the transaction fee is more than the actual payment? And why would you pay in BTC if BTC is a store of value and will only increase in value? My $ only decrease in value so I would rather spend that today than tomorrow.

Please read up on the 250K+ transactions waiting to be confirmed and the astronomical fees required to move around BTC. It's a store of value, you don't transfer it or use it. I hope you know why it has value in the first place if you can't spend it like money, cause I can't think of anything other than other people buying at higher prices than you did because they think it has value but also have no clue that it doesn't.

I'm not saying blocksize is not a temporary fix. I'm saying I would rather have a temporary fix and buy some time, one step at a time, instead of throwing your hands in the air and just replicate the current state of our financial system with new technology.

Those businesses that are using BTC you are talking about will also have to do their transactions with the use of a large hub because it won't be economically viable for merchants to open direct channels just like it won't be for users to do it. So they are forced to use LN and the large hubs that will eventually dominate the market.
Yes, LN will fix the fee problem in part. And that's exactly what I said, you are going to be forced to use a large hub on LN for day to day payments, just like you are now forced to use a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:54:00

Your money is practically stuck in BTC, you efficiently stored some value and can not transfer that value. It's like BTC still is using rai stones, and the one stating how much you own is at the bottom of the ocean. Unreachable but hey, your value has been stored.....FOREVER.

How could there be a 3rd party and still p2p? Doesn't make sense. These 3rd party 'delegating' funds are what banks are. If I wanted to pay you right now with our current financial system, the best way would be to use the service of a third party( a bank) to transfer funds. That's exactly what these hubs on the Lightning Network will do, how does that not make hubs effectively banks? How is this different than now? The only thing that's different is that money is digitized but the wealthy still are the middlemen in the form of hubs.
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:04:24

Like a transaction fee of $8 is normal, are you retarded? Just tell this guy the truth, he should of used bitcoin cash (BCH) instead. Transactionfee would have been max $0,01 and would have been cleared within an hour. BTC is a store of value, it's not intended to be moved around, certainly not small amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:19:59
No, he doesn't say anything about fees but who actually gives a donation every month? Most donations are sporadic, like now he probably got a bunch, but those people aren't going to hang around long. So the argument that he uses fiat because of automatic recurring payments is not a valid one, of course I can't say for certain but I'm pretty sure nobody has a monthly donation subscription.
About the 10 sat/byte fee, that's bullshit and you know it. I actually hold BTC (and numerous other coins) and recently moved some funds, the fees are ridiculous if we're talking small transactions. But hey, that doesn't matter if you cater to the wealthy and forget about people like Andreas who depend on small donations? 
Also, as if 24 hours is an acceptable timeframe, in what universe are you living?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:06:19
You could, just like you can potentially mine BTC right now but reality is you can't compete with big minefarms just like you are not going to be able to compete with large hubs. Right now, anybody could start a bank and be a middleman, almost nobody does because it costs enormous amounts of money. That's what is going to happen with hubs on the LN, a few large hubs controlled by a handful of people, it's the logical outcome.

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:31:09
I already admitted being wrong on the case at hand, that's why I pointed out that in an actual business case, you know, where these coins are supposed to be spent, these kind of timeframes are ridiculous. If I wanted to pay my bartab, I would be stuck there for a couple of hours waiting for my payment to get confirmed or if I pay at a webshop I have to wait an additional day for my product to arrive because the merchant is waiting for the confirmations. Or of course pay a ridiculous fee. Or you know what, let's just stick to fiat, works fiiiiine.
On the shill story, I recently decided to get involved more because I can feel that this technology has a lot of potential, in all kinds of ways and I enjoy participating more than watching from the sideline. That is the reason you are seeing a handful of posts. I was cautious with because I read the mods like to ban people for anything at any time, so yeah my account is 2 days old, and for the first day I only posted on does that make me a shill? Being critical of the current path of blockstream, does not make me a BCH shill. I would love for BTC to just increase the blocksize for the time being and work on an actual solution with the purpose of bitcoin as stated from the beginning to remain the same, peer to peer electronic cash with low fees, near instant transactions and available for anyone with and Internet connection.
The reason I keep bringing up fees and timeframes of actual bussinescases, is because those are the problems facing BTC today. To truly scale it needs to be utilized and that can't happen right now while there are opportunities; the people of Venezuela would love to get payed in BTC if the fees weren't high and if it wouldn't take a day to confirm a transaction. But here they are, stuck at the mercy of their leader. Reminds me of the hold blockstream got on BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:38:00
So the user has to be tech savvy enough to open up channels on the LN given the current state but even if that's not the case and anybody can do it with a click of a button, my channel can not compete with a large hub, LN chooses the cheapest and fastest route, that's the same as stating 'you can mine bitcoin with your laptop', hypothetically you can, practically nobody does because it's pointless to compete with professional miners running farms. But I agree, it could (but probably won't) start with small channels, say xstreetchannel, that will grow to Xcity channel, to X state channel, to X country channel. Eventually we end up in the same situation we are in now, having to trust middlemen that are too big to fail. It's the logical conclusion.
By the way, how will LN find the fastest route? Last time I checked, the traveling salesman problem was not solved.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:35:20
So according to you, I open a channel directly with you, and we can transfer funds between one another without ever getting transactions confirmed on the blockchain? So where are the hubs then? Why would we even need a blockchain if we can just open channels with one another and transfer funds? Opening a channel (with a hub, cause you need to with LN) and transferring funds, is like opening a bank account and transferring funds, no need for blockchain then. Yeah, I'm confident that's not how this work, that's not how any of this works.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:09:51

I agree that those comments are out of order and shouldn't be made but the one that keeps sticking is how ironic it is that he accepts donations but can't do that in BTC. 
I hope you're right and they do have something in the works to solve this but as of right now, I see no added value in BTC over BCH in the long run until SOMETHING is released that at least hints to a true decentralized monetary system and we're not forced to keep tabs on each other.

If you want low/no fees and fast confirmation you should definitely look into bitcoin cash (BCH)

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:28
As you described it right now is exactly what I mean. By introducing 3rd parties, you are giving the power of the P2P aspect to the hubs, not the users. Because a transaction through a third party will be 1000 times cheaper, you are forced to use it. Who would want to pay 400 satoshi for a coffee? Nobody would transfer direct because it will be too expensive. If you're transferring large funds, no problem. For day to day use, you are forced to use 3rd parties who do have the advantage of large funds. You can't compete with that as a user.
I'm not salty at all, I just would of loved for this whole thing to of never happened. LN will screw BTC up, and that's a shame. No time to be sentimental about it though because hanging on to BTC like others do is hanging on to a financial system we are already a part of but trying to fundamentally change.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:27
Nothing on the blockchain is centralized, everything on the lightning network is centralized. If you don't know how and why I suggest you start here: 
The whole deal with digital CASH is to spend it, hodling on, never spending it, will never make BTC a used currency. Hodling makes it a store of value, it could be anything. Because BTC is backed by nothing(there is no gold in a safe, no dollars in a bank), it essentially is a store of FOMO right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:15:56
I'm not saying everybody running full nodes is the solution, but LN certainly looks like something we have known to give problems and I think we could spend more time thinking of something better instead of rushing and keep doing the same thing.

1) You're right he does accept bitcoin and he was just referring to the recurring donations option. I'm even thinking of donating because again, I really feel like the remarks made were not appropriate. 
 
2) You are again right but it doesn't change the fact that most people using it, are using the wallets that are user friendly and with that come high fees that are not adjustable. This is also probably the reason he doesn't get donation in bitcoin, most users empathetic towards him are probably only willing to donate an amount less than the average fees on popular wallets, thus resulting in less donations. Ironic, I believe if he was rooting for the other side he would probably get a shitload of daily BCH donations because really he's a good guy and he did/does a lot. 
About the timeframe, say I own a website that sells laptops. If a customer pays in BTC and I would have to wait 24h for that tx to be confirmed, it's impossible to ship the product the same day so the customer gets it in the timeframe that is common for ecommerce. Had he payed in BCH the tx would have been confirmed in max. 1h and the payed fee would be a maximum of about $0,01 
I get you're trying to frame me as a BCH shill, even though I'm quite admitting of the wrongs in my comments and open to your point of view. Actually I'm pretty neutral, blockchain technology is changing the world either way. It just feels wrong to go with the path chosen by Blockchain, it feels like losing the premise of peer to peer electronic cash while giving power to what will effectively be banks.
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:14:22

You people are reaallllyy stupid. Network fees apply to all BTC transactions, those are not coinbase fees. This is what is costs to move BTC around, it's not something you use or transfer, it's a store of value. It's useless.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:12:19
What are you talking about? BCH actually has utility, the price represents adoption. BTC's price represents speculation.

You got to admit it's kind of ironic. If you wanted to support him with a small amount of BTC say $1,50, you'll be paying more in fees than the actual donation you're making. 
Agreed though, he should not have said that about this guy, it seems bullish and unnecessary. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:02:18
You are just literally repeating what they are saying and not thinking for yourself. Let the protocol sink in for a while and just think about it for a minute and try to follow a logical path. Let's agree to disagree for now, if I listen to LN should be ready in no time, 75/75 tests past! That's all you need to test for a global financial network, 75 tests y'all yiiiihaaa Wild West days.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:13:46
Great, thanks for the change in tone. I agree with 100% of what you are saying.
Also, I do not think BCH solved these issues. As I stated, I don't agree with the direction blockstream is taking this and I would rather spend more time on thinking about other solutions and in the mean time increase blocksize little by little to partially solve current problems of high fees and late confirmations. There has to be a way of scaling other than eventually ending up with sort of to-big-to-fail banks, again.

It’s hilarious seeing these shitcoins trying to ‘protect’ against 51% ‘attacks’. Owning 51% of a network is not an attack, you can not prevent that. And if you can, it’s a spreadsheet not a cryptocurrency.

There is nothing wrong with inequality and it will always be there, it’s a natural consequence of life.
I don’t think donating helps; it just empowers the poor to stay poor and look for a Superman. It’s socialist.
Capitalism on the other hand empowers the poor to have equal opportunity and bitcoin enables them to store their wealth.
The problem people like OP have is they lack the will to work.

1. I think bitcoin is under attack and as long as not all sha is pointed to 1 coin it will be that way. At this time, I don’t care. The projects in now involved in only rely on the whitepaper, whatever chain remains in the end will be bitcoin and my projects will work on it.
2. I’m far from an idiot but it’s irrelevant, learn from it.
3. The reason these projects failed was because bcash moved away from bitcoin and introduced changes. Bitcoin does not change, if it does it breaks everything built on top.
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:14:16
True! I’m actually working on a project to make it easy for anyone to earn Bitcoin by using their laptop or computer to do the working for them, it’s called [SharkPool](

Thanks bud, appreciate your support!
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:29:59
That’s what bitcoin is about: it enables you to cryptographically own your data, just like it enables you to own your money. You can use the ledger to store information that’s accessible to some but unreadable to others using a scheme of private and public keys.
Important to note is that anonymity is not even a desired characteristic. Bitcoin is designed to work within legal frameworks. It’s considered ‘money’ in the eyes of the law of practically every country.
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:14:08
The point of Bitcoin is a finite and transparent money supply. You have pseudo-anonymity transacting with Bitcoin but it was never meant to be anonymous because the only people who want anonymity instead of privacy are criminal and frauds. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:14:21
No, no he didn't. He made Bitcoin in such a way that all current laws to 'money' apply to it and governments can't do anything about it because it's by definition money. Also, you're delusional if you think Satoshi ever intended for a thousand shitcoins to appear with marketing gimmicks. That's not how sound money works.
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:47:41
Anybody promoting anything other than bitcoin is either a scammer or an ignorant fool who got duped and is trying to shill his bags. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:16:18
Why do you think bitcoin is not fungible? 
Again; bitcoin gives you privacy while keeping the money supply transparent, that's best of both worlds.
@_date: 2019-01-24 07:14:06
KYC doesn’t hurts legitimate bitcoin adoption one bit, it only makes it difficult for criminal users and fraudulent businesses to transact. I’m fine with that.
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:13:22
None of the characteristics of bitcoin require it to be anonymous so you can keep convincing people with the same arguments is all I'm saying.
And no, I haven't and if you have a normal relationship with your bank, I don't see how you would. I did have trouble with converting bitcoin to fiat (I run a business and some things need to be paid in fiat). But even that is not really an issue as long as you can show the source of your income, in my case; my businesses don't accept fiat and I have receipt to prove sales.
@_date: 2019-01-25 14:04:33
With scale, privacy is guaranteed without the need for any changes to the base protocol while still remaining within the legal definition of sound money and removing the ability for governments (or anybody) to anonymously fuck you over.
There is no such thing as a 'tainted' bitcoin. As a business, I just have to prove where **I** got it from (when you're a business, that's your customer, when you're a person, you know the person who gave it to you).
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:04:16
There is. Law is law. Failing to understand that will result in liable actions which lead to financial loss and eventually jail.

Bitcoin is not an investment, it’s money. Use it as such. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 08:55:26
No, anonymity and privacy are **definitely** not the same thing.
Privacy means only those who need access to whatever personal data get it and all others are excluded.
Anonymity means you can get away with anything without liability.
Privacy grants citizens freedom, anonymity grants the government freedom.

Yes and all those issues can be solved with privacy features built into wallets, making it so that your government knows what it needs to know and the merchant knows what he needs to know, nothing more, nothing less.

Bullshit. Bitcoin is money and money is regulated as fuck, people in crypto are just economically retarded and not aware of accountability.
You can own bitcoin at any age, like money. The catch is: buying it from exchanges requires you to be of legal age. Try earning it!

Building a business around scams is not economically viable, don’t be an economic retard like these guys, build on Bitcoin.

Regular users have 0 issue with their bank knowing who they are and where their money comes from, only criminals worry about that. Regular users also have 0 issue with exchanges doing KYC/AML (required by law), the only issue regular users have is when these exchanges and companies do not follow the rules and store data irresponsibly.
The reason bitcoin is better than fiat is because it's sound money and fiat is not. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 10:51:01
Legally acquiring bitcoin is limited to earning and buying off regulated exchanges. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 09:48:54
These sites are already obliged by law to store your data securely, it's just that regulators are slow in enforcement.
Also, it is not a fact that bitcoin was created to not give such sites information, how did you figure that? Bitcoin is created to make the economy transparent and have a fixed money supply. There is nothing wrong about having to comply with KYC/AML when the fiat you're using to buy bitcoin is clean.
@_date: 2019-01-24 13:44:04
I agree that currently businesses don't do a good job at storing your data, mostly because a) regulators do not enforce current laws and b) users don't care.
KYC/AML like currently implemented and enforced is indeed a ticking time bomb. I think if we could own our data like we own our money with Bitcoin, it would help a lot. There are ways of proving identity without losing privacy, it's just not easy and until there is strong demand for it, nobody will build it.
