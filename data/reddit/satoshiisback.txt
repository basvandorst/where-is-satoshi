And we welcome them \+ wish them the best. 
power in numbers...
This scenario is one of the reasons why to it all. This should be of no surprise and if you use products that they offer, conduct some bizz with these people! Share the experience or at the very least keep spreading the word for others to have access. 
Political note: Want big gov to stop being so big? Accept and test out this option\(alt payment method and currency\) created by the people \(a man with much vision\)for the people to be able to conduct the bizz as it should be to some extent = Without need of centralized authorities. Satoshi didn't ask for permission, he acted and shared this answer/solution and shared it with all. Let's make it happen and get it poppin.

And their children ...
The discussion needs to be more than casual at this pivotal point in time\(2020 halfsies incoming!\).
Greatest Love of All Lyrics: I believe the children are our future / Teach them well and let them lead the way

Seriously though. I'd rather their future be a test of the deflationary, transparent and immutable form than the current scam of the debt dollar we basically slay other cultures in order to keep the dingy afloat.
Edit: [ These are the gains to be realized at the current rate\(if hodled\) of the schmoller\(dollar\) for next year. Those two cents are gonna get taken away by the banks any way with some type of theft fee as is currently... just my 2 cents. :D
