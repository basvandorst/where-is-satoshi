We buy 3-5% back of Bitstamp/Coinbase for USD (green folding kind) and sell at 2.5-5% over. Many advantages to using us over LocalBitcoin include a safe transaction environment and the ability to leave without waiting for confirmations (we've been in business since 1947 and we actually own the building). I can answer any other questions here or at Landon @ wilshirecoin (dot) com

If your in Southern California come into our shop - not only do we do foreign exchange at 3-5% cheaper than the banks and airport but we also can exchange it into bitcoin if you wish.

This is definitely a trend. I operate a small BTC exchange out of our coin store and we get calls from seniors all the time. Yesterday we got a call from the local library because a senior was having trouble locating a book on BTC and wanted to see if we had any books to sell so that he could educate himself before buying in. It was very cute.

ehhh traditionally and pretty much up until the 1930's they were backed by commodities more than "the power of states". I don't think its crazy to believe in bitcoin if you take into account the evolution of currency being a commodity &gt; paper backed with commodity &gt; paper created by governments backed by a commodity &gt; paper backed by governments &gt; electronic ledger system backed by governments &gt; electronic ledger system backed by the internet.

Similar story ... paid my hedge fund neighbor in bitcoin for my half of an Indian food order. 24 hours later his fund buys 500 bTc.
