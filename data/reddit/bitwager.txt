Exactly, and even looking at the satoshis in terms of "fuel" for the protocol, 0.3 BTC is good for 30M 1-satoshi transactions.  A 21-Computer-running consumer may or may not have use cases sufficient to consume this 0.3 BTC, 1 satoshi at a time, but in any case, loading the device instead of mining is always going to be cheaper for the consumer.  He gains nothing individually by choosing mining over loading.  I do not expect a group of users to collectively act irrationally long-term in the name of the greater good.  Granted, the 21co ecosystem has value, until a community-driven alternative exists, but will that be enough to sustain itself?  The profit 21co makes on the computers can only sustain it for so long.

It's actually the opposite.  Change addresses tie multiple transactions together.

What if the double-spend transaction contains a higher transaction fee than the original transaction?

Except that's not actually true, because the price today is actually $915 vs. $861 on the chart.

I created this by combining historical MtGox and Bitstamp data.  I wanted to model the true network growth by eliminating the bubbles.

Of course it is, but it's meant to follow the floor, the bottoms of the hype cycles.  It's also fairly conservative because of this.
