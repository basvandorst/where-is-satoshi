Lack of individual liberty does lead to national security issues. Imagine if thousands of people are suddenly prone to blackmail because of backdoored encryption.

"We live in a deflationary world."
I never thought of it like that. I wish I could give you gold.

You earn Norwegian CashPoints every time you trade. Interesting.

Are we gonna let Fed decide what's a currency now?

You can't predict the market but you can figure out where in the price cycle bitcoin is right now with Mayer Multiple (price ÷ 200 DMA).
@_date: 2019-11-08 05:28:26
What if we bring brains and stomach closer?
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:04:08
I can no longer support Coinbase due to ethical concerns.
@_date: 2019-11-21 11:26:00
Nothing to celebrate. They'll refuse to recognize bitcoin as a currency to slow down its chances of being used as currency.
@_date: 2019-11-23 16:32:22
He coined the term "Mayer Multiple".
@_date: 2019-06-10 03:39:05
Nobody really knows. Use Mayer Multiple instead.

Please add Amazon India, eBay India, Flipkart, and Snapdeal.

Watch towers/nodes/hardware/add value to their bitcoin holdings.

Bitcoin is very undervalued according to Mayer Multiple. Still, buy in batches (dollar cost average).
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:44:35
Or don't.
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:15:41
Use Mayer Multiple.

Just add standard bitcoin wallet support, no need to add custodian exchanges.

Yearly lows are different. You can tell no hodlers will sell below that price. Zero. Zip. Zilch.

There isn't one. That Twitter account Tweets it out every 6 hours though.

Yearly lows have been consistently going up.

If people like that variety of bananas more, they'll become dominant.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:11:07
Hodlers are the reason yearly lows have been consistently rising. Hodl on!
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:46:30
Divide current price by 200 day moving average and you get Mayer Multiple. Follow the Twitter account, it frequently Tweets the current MM. It's really helpful to figure out how cheap or overpriced bitcoin is right now. No guesses required.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:41:25
A better method is to buy between 0.4-1.2 (or 2.0) Mayer Multiple.  
0.4-0.9 = Very undervalued
0.9-1.2 = Undervalued
1.2-2.0 = Fairly valued
2.0-2.9 = Overvalued
2.9+ = Very overvalued
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:22:31
Yes. Minimum 0.01 BTC though.

"The first steps are passing the Audit the Fed bill, allowing people to use alternative currencies, and exempting all transactions in precious metals and cryptocurrencies from capital gains taxes and other taxes."  - Ron Paul  
  
Capital gains tax is hurting bitcoin adoption; feature, not bug.

They've still got Hawala agents.
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:26:01
MM is for hodlers though, not daytraders. Predicting the market is hard and daytrading requires discipline.

Learn more about Bitcoin from people like Andreas Antonopolous and Trace Mayer and you'll be invincible from FUD.
I wish I bought Bitcoin when I was 14, that's when I first found out about it. All the best, buddy!
@_date: 2018-12-29 17:07:25
Seems fine to me.

A lot of early adopters have sold their bitcoins.

Square Cash.

Too much hassle. Just use Bitrefill to get a gift card and top-up your account once.
