It has nothing to do with that as much as it has to do with collecting additional tax money. This isn't necessarily a crypto currency specific change in the law. It applies to all like-kind trades now with the exception being real-estate.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:04:01
Yes you can restore it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 09:51:03
The address book? Like addresses that you've saved with labels or something? As long as you have your seed and password, or your private keys, then no matter what a hacker wouldn't be able to do anything to your wallet as they must unlock it first. I've been in crypto for 6+ years now and I won't be losing sleep over this RPC vulnerability. It was just a person who discovered that it is theoretically possible to gain RPC access to electrum through using unsafe javascript to send requests to the server built into electrum. Very little can be done by a hacker who gains RPC access without knowing what your wallet password is.
You also have to keep in mind that there is a very narrow set of conditions for a hacker to be successful. I can't even think of a single modern web browser that would allow such an exploit to happen in the first place. Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and even Internet Explorer will automatically alert the user and block any website using javascript that tries cross-site scripting (xss) to localhost.
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:35:44
yeah it sucks
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:08:03
Well, the address book I think is separate from your wallet file since you can change it without password. The issue with unlocking and it staying unlocked, that's a pretty serious issue and obviously anyone who is running older electrum clients need to update. So to answer your question, I would imagine that it is possible to change the address book in electrum through RPC, although I don't know for sure what commands can be executed through RPC. You can probably try accessing the RPC yourself through telnet and trying some commands.

I replied to a comment the other day about using altcoins to transfer your holdings because the Bitcoin fees are too high:
This person proceeds to tell me that:
"Nobody gives a fuck about BTC fees because they are too busy making 20% gains a day on Binance..."
I guess Microsoft doesn't give a fuck about BTC fees now do they?
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:47:15
Although this is a serious RPC vulnerability, keep these things in mind:
Most modern web browsers will automatically block a website tries to access the electrum RPC via this exploit.
If you have a password set on your wallet, a hacker would still have to somehow know your password to send commands to withdraw or modify your wallet itself. RPC could, in theory however, allow someone to modify your Electrum config without a password, but there's really nothing for them to do because the electrum config is not your wallet.
Your coins are safe as long as you have your seed written down and password protected your wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:10:58
I can't think of any. Cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been known about for a very long time now and all of the major browser vendors have taken action to mitigate xss attacks.

@_date: 2018-01-07 12:21:52
What? No, a website hosted on the internet will trigger a xss alert when you visit that site. Most browsers now will detect that the script is trying to connect to localhost and automatically block it. The only exception is html pages hosted locally on your PC.

I am shocked that hasn't accused anyone of being a shill in this thread.
Edit: Apparently hes banned from @_date: 2018-01-08 01:01:13
So you don't think that the web browser will alert you to the fact that this website is using javascript to connect to localhost? Even if it doesn't block it, you would probably see an alert window. It's not normal for a website to request access to localhost. Also, if you have a password set on your wallet a hacker cannot do anything to your wallet. Brute force can be attempted on literally anything that requires a password to log in, and if you have a strong enough password there's very little chance of being successful. Don't you think by now if anyone using Electrum lost coins they would have said something?

The tweet with the POC was just posted recently. Okay that's pretty serious, but clearly that person was using a very easy to guess password. They are also using Electrum 3.0.3. Electrum 3.0.4 disables CORS and prevents a website from doing this. You also have to have the electrum wallet open at the same time you are on a website. Keep that in mind too.

@_date: 2018-01-08 01:49:13
I'm sure that they don't expect their Electrum wallets to be publicly available. The Electrum developers have already released an interim patch to mitigate this issue. They are in the process of making the RPC password protected. Just update your electrum wallet and don't browse the internet when you are using it and you should be fine. It's a serious vulnerability, but honestly I wouldn't freak out over it if you have a strong password set on your wallet. AFAIK there hasn't even been a proof of concept for this vulnerability in Electrum. There's been a proof of concept for Ethereum, but not Electrum.

Over the past 6 years I have witnessed massive gains and losses. There's no worse feeling than waiting for a bounce that never happens. I never invested any money into Bitcoin. I have earned all of my coins by mining and trading. Although my circumstances are different than yours, I do have friends who have poured savings into Bitcoin, and I have been witness to consequences of naivete. I've seen people in chat rooms become absolutely distraught when the price of Bitcoin flash-crashed from $600 down to below $100 on February 10th, 2014. There was a man in the chat room pleading for help because he had lost nearly his entire savings. He said that his wife will divorce him, as though he were absolutely certain it would happen, because he didn't tell her that he took out a second mortgage on his house to buy Bitcoin. He also said that he was thinking about committing suicide. I truly hope he didn't. My point is, that if you aren't careful, you can lose more than you realize. Good luck m8.

So how exactly would the IRS know that we trade between currencies unless we voluntarily report it? The reason I even ask is because in my case, my holdings have been all mining profits, and the majority of exchanges that I traded on years ago are defunct. There's literally no way for me to go back in time and figure out how I ended up with 10s of thousands of dollars worth of coins. I get this feeling that the IRS will audit me no matter what if and when I cash out because it looks like the money came out of thin air.

Yea, I mean it's almost like I'm damned if I do, damned if I don't. If I report it, then it looks like the money came out of thin air and I'll be audited. If I don't, I may or may not be audited. At least then the IRS would have to do some of the work to figure out how to file it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:02
I can kind of see the problem the core devs are facing: Increase block size and get a temporary fix. Future blocks from here out use 2x the storage space. Right now the block chain is a little under 200GB. In this scenario it's going to be more costly for the average person to run nodes and then we inevitably end up with increased centralization. Once we start increasing the block size it opens the door to future increases, and the size of the block chain eventually gets out of hand. I think there needs to be a combination of working side chains, a better, quicker, difficulty adjustment algorithm and somehow be able to automatically archive/trim blocks older than x without breaking anything.

If you like to gamble and are okay with losing money in exchange for a good time then this is about as good as it gets. If you are the type that will be woken up in the middle of the night panicking because the price dropped 30% overnight, then just take it slow and wait for things to calm a bit.

Every transaction is added to the blockchain after miners confirm the transaction. This transaction is encrypted / signed with a public / private key and contains the originating address and destination address along with the amount of Bitcoin sent/received. Only the person who owns the private key of the receiving address has access to the Bitcoin received in the transaction. If you are the one who receives the Bitcoin in this transaction, you are the owner as long as you have both the public and private keys of the address. The public and private keys can be exported into hashes that you can print on paper. As long as you hold the paper, you can import your private keys into a new wallet and the balance of your Bitcoin will be available to you.

With crypto being completely unregulated, there's nothing stopping people from putting up massively large buy walls with the intention of never filling the order, which can make it appear that there is support at a certain level.

Coinbase will get their money. He made a deal with Coinbase and now wants to renege on it. He's going to get fucked, but now that he's trying to get the bank to stop the payment, he's going to be even more fucked when coinbase puts restrictions on his account due to him trying to fuck them, and the bank will likely overdraft his account. It's like trying to get a refund at a casino. That shit just doesn't happen.

If the price of BTC goes down after you sell alt into BTC then your total value in USD worth of BTC goes down. Right now most alts are trending with BTC, so don't expect a lot of deviation in the markets right now. There are exceptions, but right now is not the time to be trading alts hoping that the exchange rate increases against BTC. The market is too volatile and the risk of a newbie like yourself losing your Bitcoin is very high. Wait until BTC stabilizes for about a week. The alts should start breaking out on their own away from BTC once the fear calms. That's when it's safer for newbies like yourself to trade alts.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:43:27

Payments in Bitcoin have always been slow compared to most alts. This isn't a new thing. The 10 minute block time is a big factor in the reason why  it's slow. Only third party payment processors like Bitpay used zero confirmation payments. I get that confirmations are taking longer now and fees are higher, but even as recent as a couple of years ago ago it wasn't unusual to wait 30-60 minutes for transactions to go through. I thought it was common knowledge that you buy into alts like Litecoin to move coins around then buy back into Bitcoin.

Nothing is certain. Only a select few get 1000% returns.
@_date: 2014-04-02 01:33:34
I have had this happen before. It is not easy, and it takes time to get your accounts back in your control. You will need to e-mail each and every service you have 2fa enabled on and request that it be disabled. Explain that you lost your phone, and you have no other backups for 2fa. Most exchanges are going to request that you provide evidence that you are who you say you are. You need to be able to provide recent transaction details that only you would know about. When I did this with BTC-E they requested the last 5 or so recent transactions (what currencies, amounts, dates/times etc...). In the case of BTC-E they will disable 2fa and place your account on hold for approximately 2 weeks as per their security policy. I have no idea what other exchanges policies are. In the future, always backup your 2fa on your PC with WinAuth  Good luck.

@_date: 2014-04-02 05:32:21
I wasn't being dramatic. I was sharing my experience, and giving the exact steps needed to fix the issue at hand. If you don't have backups of 2fa, and you lose your device, you have to contact the services (either by e-mail or support ticket). There is no other way to gain access to your account, and that is the point of having 2fa in the first place. I agree with you on using Authy as I use it myself. It appears the OP does not unfortunately. The time it takes to recover your account will also vary. I gave an example of BTC-E because they have stringent security policies in place that lock your account for ~2 weeks when you make a request to disable 2fa. Take care.
@_date: 2014-02-22 09:43:09

These are bots flooding the orderbook. There's some good explanations from other redditors here, but another reason why this happens is ticker manipulation. Every time the price moves a bot can be programmed to instantly buy or sell, masking the current periods buy and sell pressure. Always check the actual amount of volume in large buys or sells.

You can do everything you would otherwise do with Bitcoin in Litecoin, including paper wallets. The reason I recommended it is because both Bitcoin and Litecoin co-exist peacefully.

Transactions require confirmations. Confirmations take time. Bitcoin has had slow confirmation times for years now...it's nothing new or unique to your situation. The transaction fees being absurdly high rests solely on the wallet software you use and the entity you are conducting business with. I would imagine they set the fees high to speed up confirmation times. If you want to move Bitcoin around between exchanges, buy into Litecoin and withdraw to another exchange. The confirmation times on Litecoin are quick and the transaction fees are minimal. Once your Litecoin is on the other Exchange buy back into Bitcoin. If you have some time and patience you can end up paying no fees or even making a small profit in the end.
I also want to add that I purposely advised buying Litecoin because, unlike the Bitcoin Cash community, the Litecoin and Bitcoin communities have demonstrated over the years that it is possible to peacefully co-exist with one another.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:20:07

If your dealings with Bitcoin, or any other crypto-currency are generating taxable income, then you have an obligation to pay taxes. Avoiding taxes is one of the issues that lawmakers have with Bitcoin. Taxes may not be fair in all circumstances, but, if you want Bitcoin to succeed as a legitimate currency, then consider following the laws in your country.
