I agree with you, but I also think there are some other factors, such as bitcoin having the biggest brand name, and the fact that there are a lot of people in it just for the money.
Regardless of all that, it would be a much better community if people discussed with reasoning the people wanting to fork, and supporting other altcoins.

Holy shit, It is for people like you that I hate this subreddit sometimes... You make it look like a fucking cult.
Is okay to have different opinions, in fact, it is good for the bitcoin ecosystem.

What exchange accepts petro?
As far as I know, it never existed, it was the government printing a document saying you have petro lol.

The video title on r/btc is **"Full debate between Jimmy song and Roger Ver"** How is that biased?...
As for Roger being all those things you said, maybe, I don't know the guy... but a debates must have appearance of impartiality before you hear them.

Hello? Is this CNBC? I'm calling to let you know that Roger Ver is not "bitcoin Jesus" anymore. okay? Ok, thanks, bye.

Bitcoin cash is not decentralized, we all know that. But I also think Bitcoin can be even more decentralized, I feel like it lacks different opinions within the current team and the community without everyone feeling threatened.

I am by no means trying to convince you that BCH is better.
I am however, trying to convince you and have you convince other people as well to focus your arguments in Bitcoin and Crypto innovation more than BTC vs BCH. That will never end, there will always be "malicious" BTC forks if you want to call them that.
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:38:57
Bitcoin is one of many digital currencies in the space.
Nobody is forcing anybody to use only one.
However, there are many people including you, trying to make people NOT use one, or only use one.
These are new technologies and as proven thus far, there is market for more than one cryptocurrency, the market will find its true value/true uses with time, not by people telling others what to do/use.

* **"Roger is the worst".** Maybe, I don't know the guy.
* **"Showed up unprepared"** The format and the topic of discussion were undisclosed.
* **"Inchoherent arguments"** There were some coherent arguments. Even though I don't agree with all of them
What I'm trying to say is that we should focus more of the development of crypto against fiat, and less about X coin is better than Y coin. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:45:05
I agree with you, it should not be called Bitcoin.
I just visited that website for the first time, and found that it says Bitcoin Cash everywhere, but then again I did not spend more than 2 minutes there. Or is that what bothers you? That it contains the word Bitcoin in its name?
If Toyota has an executive/managerial split, and there were no trademarks or Intellectual properties (just for the sake of this argument), and they both decide to keep producing cars, I would not see a problem if there were Toyota and Toyota Cars... Would it be confusing? Absolutely... Would you find people arguing about Toyota Cars is not the real Toyota and getting angry at people who buy the other Toyota? I dont think so

This reminds me a bit of poloniex, okay for trading due to liquidity but not very user friendly.
Take a look at some professionals Forex trading platforms, not some web-based trading cryptos, and you'll get some more ideas.
For instance, I cant believe only bitfinex has proper chart studies, and trailing orders.

Why uploading the video in this sub with a biased title?They uploaded the video to r/btc with a normal title.
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:33:35
That is a clip of Jimmy song walking out of the stage. Is the title misleading? Yes. But the video of the full debate is titled correctly. 
BCH subreddit has some vote manipulation, that is no secret. But Bitcoin subreddit also has some censorship. None of the subreddits are optimal.
I would just like these debates, and people watching them to be steered towards Crypto vs Fiat, and seek innovation, rather than X is better than Y within the crypto space.

Competition is healthy, we do not see Yahoo saying that Alphabet is an attack against Yahoo or the other way around. We also don't get mad if our friends or people we don't know use Amazon prime instead of Netflix, or Euro instead of Dollar... The list goes on...
Why there has to be such a tribalism in the crypto space? I really do not think is good for new people in the space, and much less for the crypto space in general against crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-11 02:24:16
It wasn't. There was no topic of debate or title on the blockchain cruise for it. It was simple "Debate between Jimmy song and Roger ver".
Of course is easy to foresee that the debate will go towards those topics given the characteristics that these to individuals are known for, but it could also very well be addressed towards cryptocurrency development, which in itself will be a lot more productive for the ecosystem.
The space does not have to be toxic or tribalistic, we do not see stock analyst being disrespectful towards each other arguing that Alphabet is better than Amazon... It is not healthy for new people coming to the space, and is clearly not helping the crypto space. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 01:56:32
I don't see a reason why this video would get deleted, both sides had good arguments.
But lets be real, r/bitcoin has some censorship and r/btc has some vote manipulation. None of the subs are optimal.

Is that all ____ (Andrea antonopolous, Tone Vays, Roger Ver, Insert any crypto influence) does?
Yes. everyone has an agenda.

1) "decent size" all import is done in dollars, bitcoin is a minimal fraction. Most of the largest shipping companies don't even accept crypto.
2) Government does not subsidizes mining. Government subsidizes electricity, but is very against mining. Government has seized mining equipment, made it illegal and thrown people in jail for mining with charges ranging from: Financing terrorism, money laundering, and destroying the national electrical system... The only large miners in Venezuela are government officials that have publicly shared some photos on twitter/instagram, everyone else is subject to corruption. And it is very easy for the government to know who is mining.
3) People dont use bitcoin as a transactional currency in Venezuela... Even with low fees in the $1 or $2 dollars, that is a MONTHLY minimum wage. You would be out of your mind to spend a minimum wage in a transaction cost.
Stop spreading this non-sense bullshit. I'm all for bitcoin adoption, but like I said, people here are completely desingenuous to think Venezuelans will adopt crypto anytime soon.

There is a website that follows all the coins remaining, so you can keep track when were they last moved... I don't know it now, but Im sure a simple google/reddit search will find it.

I'd recommend you watch the Interview he did with Ivan on tech, he actually talked about all the things that ethereum is trying out that can help the ecosystem... Not just ethereum but the rest of other altcoins... 
We need those altcoins to play the experimental role testing stuff out, that's how innovation works. We can't test all that within the Bitcoin network because it brings an unwanted risk.
Not sure why people even downvote my argument. Is beyond my grasp of understanding seeing how some people hate on altcoins just because they compete with bitcoin without understanding how it can help bitcoin in the future. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 00:12:47
I actually did not... Wasn't aware...
Even with that into account, he has brought many valuable arguments for bitcoin in the past. I don't have to agree with everything he says, or hate the guy because some fud he spread. 
In a way, is like Roger ver, I don't like the fork with bitcoin cash and the confusion it has brought into the space. But I like what Roger had to say about bitcoin 2-3 years ago. I'm sure he got many people involved into bitcoin and helped the space grow a lot back then

People who said shit like this dont realize this ultimately hurts the entire ecosystem of cryptocurrencies including bitcoin?
Is like Malboro saying smoking Camels is bad because of nicotine. 
I understand, you might be a bitcoin maximalist and feel threatened by some altcoins... But you gotta work on your arguments, take a look at Richard Hart, he was a hero here, a bitcoin maximalist persona... Now he supports other good coins that are testing new stuff like Ethereum, monero, etc...  
At the end of the day, those other altcoins are the ones doing the innovation, taking the risky approach, which is good for everyone. You gotta remember, this is open source environment.

Most venezuelans can only worry about if they have money to eat today or if they can afford to feed their children. It is quite desingenuous to think Venezuelans will mass adopt bitcoin.
Im not sure what the purpose of these articles are...

You really think a 0.1 sat transaction would be included ON TOP as the highest priority in the block?
Sure, it could've gotten included in other blocks, or at the end of the block. But it is technically impossible to be included on top like that. That only happens if you pay an accelerator, or if slush set the priority on it. It is not organic.
And yes, Roger Ver and Tone Vays lie all the time... I don't care about their bet or themselves. I just want to point out the transaction being included on top of the block with that fee is not an organic occurrence.
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:30:51
It is based on priority.
If you look at blocks, the transactions on the top are the ones with the highest fees. It makes no sense for a 1sat fee to be near the top. 
The ones that followed next were about 200+ satoshis
@_date: 2019-05-25 20:33:59
It might not be the only factor, but is definitively the factor that carries the most weight.  
I compared over 50 random blocks so far and the correlation is positive on higher fees being placed on the top.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:08:19
I don't trust, I verify.  I'm looking at random blocks and I have not seen a similar low fee on top of a block. Any explanation?
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:04:09
He is not, and not sure he will ever be.
But you must be new if you think he wasn't. This guy got more people to use Bitcoin 7-8 years ago than anyone else in the space.
He was the andreas antonopolous back then before he went into bch
