For the sake of painting a complete picture, poverty and/or bad financial situations are not necessarily the result of bad decisions. Sickness, accidents, and bad luck can happen to anyone with no rhyme or reason.

All of gold's "uses" are less than 10% of its market cap. It's valuable because of its high stock to flow ratio. If it were no longer considered the bets store of value it would tank hard.

This is just false. How old are you?
Bad luck is not working a low-paying job. I'm talking about bad luck like being born with fetal alcohol syndrome, or getting hit by a drunk driver and becoming a quadriplegic, or being wrongly imprisoned, or like a million things. Use your imagination.
You can do everything right and still get boned. That's life.

Maybe, maybe not. We don't know for sure. We'll be dead anyway so maybe it's moot

That way you we still maintain some block reward coming from mining every single block, regardless of the tx fees in that block. 
It's more or maintaining the current status quo which seems to be working well and possibly defending against scenarios that are hard to envision right now.

Personally I don't see why Bitcoin couldn't have been made to have the inflation rate slowly trend towards 0 but never actually get there. That would still achieve the goal of being disinflationary, high and stable stock/flow ratio, and an algorithmic monetary policy

The last point is so important. People don't realized this is true for healthcare too. The fact that many poor people don't have health insurance is so expensive for everyone. They (the uninsured, as a population) don't do routine checkups or preventative care, then they show up in the emergency room for something that could have been prevented for 100x less the cost, tying up valuable resources and increasing the costs for everyone. 
People say "why should I pay for them?" without realizing you're already paying out the ass for them.

Bitcoin is the best performing asset over the last decade
@_date: 2019-08-16 22:56:08
That's super fabulous and we're all super happy for you and also no one gives a shit
@_date: 2019-08-16 23:00:40
Not quite a straight path but, yes it's already way more valuable than I thought it would be
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:55:18
Might want to check your math.
Bitcoin was trading at about $575 on August 16, 2016. At current prices around $10,400, that's a 1,700% increase.

Cash flow is king. 
You work as an employee to earn cashflow. You quit when you have enough cashflow to stop being an employee but then you have to work at maintaining whatever is generating your cashflow.

This is a dumb take. 
Bitcoin is hard money. It's also the first implementation of a digital asset and opened up a Pandora's box. There are a number of other use cases of other kinds of digital assets that will exist. Will they be as valuable as Bitcoin? Probably not, but digital assets will be huge and used for all sorts of things, especially financial derivatives and digital collectables, among other things I can't even predict. 
Maybe it will all be Bitcoin based and/or on a sidechain or nth layer or something else but digital assets will be used for more than just hard money. They already are.

Isn't de-mixing (believe that's the term) a solved problem?

You revealed some info related to your employment status. I recommend editing this answer.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:48:30
No. You are way off base.
None of the things you described were relevant when gold became global commodity-money nor when the USD became the world reserve currency (in mostly paper form).
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:00:59
My point has been that you don't know what you're talking about but if I must make my own point...
Governments are off the gold standard but they still hoard gold in their treasuries because of jurisdictional competition. They could sell all the gold in their vaults but their enemies might be advantaged by holding it. Money is similar to weapons in this regard - it creates a sort of arms race because economic leverage is very powerful geopolitical tool. Assuming Bitcoin is considered valuable, it's unlikely governments will ban Bitcoin for this reason.
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:37:24
Bitcoin is trying to be a global commodity-money. What you are talking about is completely irrelevant. Do you avoid USD because it's used by the cartels?
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:17:08


You mean like BitTorrent? The one that's been around since 2001 and accounts for 4%+ of all internet traffic around the world?
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:13:44


Dude, the guy you're arguing with is a clown and I don't think governments can or will ban Bitcoin but c'mon. You think you're smarter than the guys at NSA? 
Anyone competent in the darknet markets will tell you do not fuck with the feds under any circumstances.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:23:14
I'm with you, but you still need cash flow to invest for the future otherwise you have nothing to invest with

This is factually incorrect. This would trigger capital gains 
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:00:11


I agree, but we are not there yet.


Maybe, maybe not. I wouldn't bet on it.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:50:20
1) no. 
2) capital gains become a nightmare to deal with
3) even volatility within a single day could cause problems for a small business 
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:39:33
It doesn't matter about how fast the transaction occurs, it's about the gains or loss. Obviously, if there is 0 gain or loss there are no capital gains. 
However it's not practical to accomplish what you described. You will have slippage and price movements, and your bakery or whatever now needs to have an accountant/trader to deal with the headache. It's exactly why merchants like BitPay exist. 
@_date: 2019-04-19 21:05:46
This is the best solution IMO. The worst part about exchanges is the risk of them losing/stealing your money. The security gains by this structural change are enormous.
On the other hand, the centralized order matching model works well. It's fast and cheaper than on-chain transactions. You could realistically do market making. The order book is generally not a pain point for most people on centralized exchanges. Custody/KYC is.

I made this exact thing in 2013 except yours looks nicer. Didn't get much traction. I was getting a few orders a week when I shut it down.  Feedback I got often was that nobody wanted to spend crypto because they thought the price would go up (they were right, largely). Oddly, the largest amount of orders came from people spending Vertcoin. No idea why.

Why not? It's Unix that actually just works and doesn't require hours of troubleshooting when random stuff doesn't work (like trying playing music, for example, without crawling forums and having to install a bunch of random drivers).

60 minutes is a pretty good news show actually
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:04:04
Maybe not but I still wouldn't bet against it. It's a new asset class not necessarily a dollar replacement. However it's possible this asset class eats the old asset class's lunch.

The tulip thing is pretty much all bullshit btw
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:44:32
This is pretty meaningless tho. They 'banned' crypto exporting in the 90s. Code and money are protected but there are plenty of illegal things you could do with code or money. 
The more realistic problem in my opinion is jurisdictional competition.
