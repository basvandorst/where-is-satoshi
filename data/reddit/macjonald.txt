Oi! Don't confuse the banking elite with the masses. What the FCA wants is usually at odds to the general public here - and bankers are hated by most. Also, it's really nice here (at least in the Scottish part) - come and visit and I'll show you some amazing beaches!
To be fair, it's not a ban on crypto itself.

What's the limits on energy use for bitcoin? What causes it to be more energy intensive? Is it the halvenings?
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:56:37
Yes! This is fantastic. Thanks for posting it.
Actually, any good resources on reading up on lightning?

I used the words ‘knife crime as a percentage’ because I’m well aware of the population difference between the US and UK - and yes there is a higher percentage of knife crime in the US... 
The NHS has been around for seventy years (It’s already survived long-term) and we do actually pay for it through our tax (everyone is covered) and my many first-hand experiences of using it is what makes me so thankful for it. The US (I’m going to assume you’re from the US) actually spends more via government spending on it’s healthcare per capita (percentages again) than the UK, and there are still tens of millions of Americans who aren’t covered at all. Believe me, compared to many many many countries (I’ve lived in a few others) - the service is good and payment never crosses our minds whenever we find ourselves unlucky enough to be sick or injured.
Again, no one has voted for Boris Johnson - he’s trying to take over as our new unelected Prime Minister as our current one is stepping down - as I said, I would expect him to lose an actual General Election because most of the country thinks he’s a nob.
I said we are second to the US in terms of the number of institutions in the top 100. I wasn’t talking about placement.
Wow, completely repeating every single point again to someone because they’ve not read the second half of any sentence I’ve previously written is incredibly tiring. I do hope this isn’t how you go about your everyday life as I imagine existence would be extremely confusing for you.
Whatever the UK did to you, I’m truly sorry - it must have been bad.

Ah, thank you for that, I’ll get tucked in.

Can you do a comparison to how much energy bitcoin would use scaled up to cover all of today’s currency transactions globally (I know there are technical issues with that so it’s theoretical) compared to the amount of energy the global banking industry uses with minting new coins and notes, keeping all of their branches, atms and offices lit, heated, powered and ventilated, transporting their people and goods and running their computing equipment to keep their ledgers going. Let’s do this properly.
Also, let’s find out how much of the energy going in to bitcoin is renewable and would otherwise be flushed (huge amounts of hydroelectric energy is flushed in China constantly due to overproduction). I’m a designer, so if anyone wants to help out with the research, I’m happy to make infographics/an animation to put out.
How feasible would a solar farm operation be for mining? Still expensive and technically difficult, but at least the energy is clean.

Oh flipping heck, I always miss this game!
@_date: 2019-07-28 09:08:25
Good question, early money was always something you could eat like grain or cocoa beans because people couldn’t wrap their heads around a universal token of value which you couldn’t use in an immediate way. Then, when people got sick of eating huge supplies of grain, they turned to more abstract forms of money like shells, stones and shiny metal. Then we had paper and, that’s pretty much disappeared as well. 
Now we live in an era where tokens of value are purely abstract digital recordings on a banks ledger. The value however hasn’t changed. The value comes from having a token which will be accepted for a predictable value in exchange for a good or service no matter who you are (trustless). 
Bitcoins value (despite not being accepted universally yet - but hey, the first motorcars were slower than horses) come from being able to do this in completely decentralised way (less chance of corruption to the system).
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:30:14
Okay, thanks for typing that out for me - much appreciated. I'm going to look into it more.
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:58:44
Maybe get some advice on the graphic design subreddit. Or get a designer to do the job. There's a lot of value to quality visual communications with your market and it really effects how people judge your service offering.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:02:35
Well, a positive ecosystem in China would boost BTCs value massively. I get your point is about the constant FUD though
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:52:27
See, this is it. When you use Bitcoin, you take full responsibility for your funds and transactions - you become your bank. Now, if you believe the general public aren't mature enough to handle their own money, of course you would think Bitcoin isn't going to work. We have a debt culture here in the West, built on savvy marketing, easy credit and financial products designed to make it hard to pay off loans early, etc.
@_date: 2019-07-09 21:21:09
Yes! I'm sure I read that somewhere. Be good to see the maths.
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:51:54
Yes! Well done. I love spending (and replacing) my bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-16 15:27:29
Yeah that's an interesting example. That's a technologically advanced society with a strong economy and the government has near absolute power. Clearly, they see BTC as a threat. However, it's not a ban on ownership or trading BTC, it's a ban on the fiat ramps into BTC and accepting it commercially from what I can see. I think it's a case of hedging their bets in case it does indeed become a fully fledged global currency.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:44:37
Haha - bloody hell. Carnage!
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:53:56
I can see a satellite system having a huge effect on state censored Internet. China's government is in for a shock. Also, untethered access to the blockchain wherever the hell you are is a huge jump in usability.

Oh sure, I use [purse.io]( They're a company based in San Francisco I think. Basically, you put whatever you want in an Amazon wish list and copy the link accross to their website. You pay them with BTC and choose a discount amount (the higher a discount the longer you wait - although I usually only wait for half a day at most). They find a buyer who is willing to trade Amazon vouchers at a loss to get BTC and you get the item through the post as per usual. 
You confirm when you've got the item in front of you and the company releases the BTC to the buyer. I've never had and issue with them and I've made purchases up to £360 (£100 off, yippeee) without a problem. The buyer and Purse don't see any of your private details as it uses Amazons 'Wish List' function, where even the buyer can't see your delivery address.
I think it works because Amazon pay their workers with Amazon vouchers through their Turks scheme and not everyone wants to buy everything from Amazon.

@_date: 2019-07-10 22:48:31
People will rush back in when they feel like it would be stupid to ignore it any more. I assume this’ll be just after a new all time high. There are still barriers to mass adoption, although we’re in a much better place than 2017. Keep asking small businesses if they accept bitcoin.
It’s human nature to not really take something up on the first opportunity unless you can see everyone around you doing it. But these guys are going to realise bitcoins not going to die like the press has been telling them for years, and then they’ll come. I’ve been in since Q3 2016 too, you’re probably just a bit tired from the drama like me. Just focus on the amazing design behind BTC and be inspired by the giant shitstorm one person (possibly a small group) has created in the worlds banking elite’s corrupt paradise
@_date: 2019-07-16 21:44:48
Oh bloody hell, it’s you again. I’ll say it once more - you’ve just described the USD
@_date: 2019-07-18 14:42:37
Did it just jump up $600 in the last ten minutes? Is Coindesk broken?
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:07:49
Sorry yes, I’m half in this because I’m avoiding doing some project work at the moment. 
Yeah, I know national banks have all the power since Western governments conceded it to them in the 70’s and the Rothschilds have an unbelievable amount of say over what happens globally. It’s just that we’ve been witnessing entire industries collapsing since the birth of the World Wide Web with very little fightback. Newspapers, Music, TV broadcasting, Hotels, Taxi services, Education. They’ve all had to adapt or die, and a lot of the adapting involves plenty dying.
I know the banking industry is a different beast and they are considered too big to die + must be bailed out by us shmucks when they’ve been very naughty and screwed up the economy. I don’t think they know how to handle decentralised global currencies though. Make it illegal to buy any with fiat, shut down exchanges and atms in your country? Congratulations, you’ve just massively put your country behind the other ones who are more open to BTC.
Over here in the UK just like the US, the government ‘hates’ drugs. Users are criminals who get hefty punishments, sellers - even worse. Millions and millions are spent fighting and educating the public against drug use. It’s not working. They’re as popular as ever - people are still raking it in selling them, politicians are having to explain using them themselves constantly. Not that I advocate using drugs. BTC is pretty much invisible - imagine policing that?
@_date: 2019-07-06 20:13:22
I've used it for two years. I choose to get 29% off everything I buy (usually only half a days wait to get picked up). I've bought some items worth over £350 (over £100 discounts!) and have never had a problem. I've probably bought around 15 things so far - actually just waiting for one to arrive in the post right now. It feels great to spend BTC and get a third off anything I want! I tell my non-crypto friends and they just stare - but then go crazy over a 10% off sale somewhere else. Ah well...
It works because some people prefer BTC over the Amazon vouchers they get paid in through the Amazon Turks programme and are willing to take a bit of a hit. It uses Amazons Wish List system, so no-one can see your details or delivery address.
@_date: 2019-07-17 15:29:54
So to qualify to have an opinion on an Internet forum, I need to go back in time and work out how to stop entire nations from embarking on organised slavery? That’s an interesting logic center you’ve got there mate.
Edit: you’ve completely lost me on the 4 grand green suit. No idea what you’re talking about.
@_date: 2019-07-04 10:05:42
Any time I’ve hesitated buying BTC, I’ve regretted not just going ahead. Best thing to do is to educate yourself on it as quickly as you can and you’ll soon begin to develop a confidence that this isn’t a merely a fad, but actually a paradigm shift in money.

What makes you say I think I’m intelligent? Never made that claim.
I was referring to your ‘send her back’ quote about a LEGAL American citizen. I completely agree that to avoid chaos at this time, the best way is for a fair immigration system which deports those who break the rules.
It’s your type of attitude which made me stop going to church after an entire childhood of it. I grew up in possibly the most densely (pretty Calvinist) Christian area in Europe where all shops still close every Sunday and there’s a church every hundred yards (Also the place where your hero’s mom came from). Believe me, I know the bible inside out. I also have a lot of respect for Christians who are true to their teachings.
I can only wonder what would happen if the brown-skinned, Middle Eastern Jesus tried to enter the United States today? Makes for an interesting thought experiment.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:04:46
Totally use it to buy things at a discount on Amazon via Purse.io though - obviously top it up afterwards.
@_date: 2019-07-09 11:00:54
Checked again, and save for ElephantGlues message, you challenge everything else. Tungi17 makes a huge sweeping generalisation that everyone is using BTC to speculate and ignores the huge amount of users who want to get the hell out of Fiat into a better system - and you immediately agree.
I'm not saying that it's bad to question things and see what can be improved, and you have the right to say whatever you like of course - it's fairly clear that you're coming in with an agenda though.

Yeah, really do appreciate that you want to have a conversation and improve things. It's always a good idea to sound things out and I would never suggest that you don't do that. I think that the evidence that CW isn't Satoshi is overwhelming. While I'm not a technical expert on blockchain and BTC, I know enough to be blown away at the brilliance of the design, and have done enough reading up on it to have no doubts that while CW may know who Satoshi is, he's not your man. Probably Hal Finney I reckon.

There is a whole bitcoin culture around holding your own keys. I would think most people with a decent amount of BTC have their savings in a private wallet and maybe just use Coinbase Pro temporarily as a trading platform. Koren0 points out that if you really were someone who just wanted an easy life and no hassle you could choose to use something like Coinbase.

Blocking addresses sets a very dangerous precedent... Oh, that guy is a criminal - let's block his wallets... US government hates wikileaks - let's block their wallets... Oh, I bought something from Cuba (or whatever country is 'bad') - wallets blocked. The trust in the system would immediately dissappear and Bitcoin would fail pretty quickly.
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:30:19
Bitcoin is exactly 'trustless' as in you don't need any trust in another human or organisation for it to work. PayPal restricts transactions, locks up funds and its easier to hack into a PayPal 'wallet'.

Maybe I'm a unique flower, but I honestly don't give a toss about cash back rewards, air miles or insurance. Purchase protection is something I do like.
Actually, thinking about it... not sure if it's just me, but I'm constantly getting card purchases blocked by my banks fraud team for trying to buy things like electronics from smaller websites. Then I have to phone them up and confirm that I'm really me, before having to contact the vendor to see if they can put the payment through again. It's happened enough times over the last year to really do my head in. Sometimes I need to wait until the next day, because the vendors phonelines have shut. Guess what's never ever ever happened with my history of buying things with my bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-17 23:28:41

Any ideology (religious, political etc) when taken to extremes is a dangerous thing indeed. Glad that skin colour means nothing to you - that would be a nasty hobby indeed. You’re right about me not understanding your ‘logos’ statement - I assume it regards some sort of ethno-sociological theory, sounds interesting.
Terrified egos seek reinforcement in a group identity bolstered by a common enemy. Maybe spend less time labelling and compartmentalising man-made reality and don’t forget to take your vitamins. 
I’m glad you’re a Bitcoiner - therein lies our common ground. Anyway, I’m off to eat some fishcakes and noodles.

Yeah I got your point earlier son. I’m just saying that the idiots in control of the country (and the odd few stabby criminals) aren’t a true representation of all of the people in it. Crime rates are at record lows, no one has voted for Boris Johnson (he’d definitely lose a general election), knife crime as a percentage is lower than in the US and we have some extremely amazing things like our social health care system and our academic institutions (second only to the US in the share of the worlds top 100 universities). Sure, Westminster is a huge toff car crash, but Britain’s not a shithole. Not yet, at least.

You did well explaining it there, I had a look.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:28:50
It's more to do with percentage increases. On route to $200,000, people will have bought in at 10k, 20k, 50k, 100k, 150k. A $200,000 value wouldn't necessarily represent a huge increase for everyone - so not everyone will cash out when it hits $200,000... e.g. There will have been people who dropped $1000 in at the $150,000 level which would be $1333 when it hits the 200k mark. Damn I hope it goes that high!
I never want to sell it into fiat - I really want to buy some cool stuff directly with BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:25:56
I was referring to your claim that there are no incentives to use crypto for your typical daily payments. I've just illustrated a huge incentive for myself. Your initial post states that people don't care about the big picture and just want ease of use, but you seem to be discounting my example as not dealing with the big picture. I suggest you choose one.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:20:24

I don’t see it happening, but it’s an interesting thought experiment to think about how Bitcoin could cope with a worldwide ban. It’s beautifully designed to play off the idea of competing nations and the lack of technical expertise in positions of power to ensure it isn’t choked out.

Bitcoin is the first truly global digital currency. 3.7 billion people are deemed ineligible to have a bank account and all that goes with that (loans, digital transactions etc). They just need a smartphone and they can immediately begin transacting with anyone else on Earth. No need to go through any middlemen slowing things down and taking slices.
@_date: 2019-07-28 08:55:35
1. It’s completely borderless - a global currency where you can basically email money to anyone on earth for a small fee in ten minutes (beats the 10% and one week my bank offers). 
2. You can store hundreds of millions of USD worth in a list of 12 words in your head. 
3. It’s a finite resource, no quantative easing bringing the value down for everyone. 
4. Its truly decentralised, so no central point of corruption in control (the reason there are so many problems with fiat money). 
5. It’s been around for 10 years despite repeated attacks on the system technologically and politically and it’s only become more robust and valuable. 
6. The bitcoin payment network has never ever gone down (unlike Visa and MasterCard). 
7. Anyone with a smartphone can give and receive bitcoin transactions - good news for the 3.7 billion people who aren’t able to have a bank account. 
8. Fees aren’t going to be an issue for small purchases with the lightning network. Fees aren’t a percentage, so something like 300 million dollars was transacted in a single move for $7 last November (if I recall correctly). 
9. You can’t make a fake bitcoin - forgery is impossible. 
10. You have complete control over your money, no limits on what you’re allowed to cross borders with, no restrictions on what you can buy (e.g. payment processors refusing to let people donate to wiki leaks)
11. There may be other currencies with some of these value propositions, but Bitcoin has them all.
That’s off the top of my head, sure there’s more...
@_date: 2019-07-14 18:46:11
What....No way! Thank you so much for the gold. You’re one of the good ones!
@_date: 2019-07-29 22:29:54
Visa charges its end users a percentage of the transactions. These costs are usually passed on to customers. The amount of times I've been told "Sorry, we only take purchases over £5 if you're paying with a card" in small shops...
Also (and to be fair, it doesn't happen too often) the Visa or Mastercard network has gone down for hours at a time (in the UK anyway). This has never happened to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-17 11:31:22

Haha, that was a passive-aggressive masterpiece! Volatility will drop as adoption increases and it’ll be increasingly less of a gamble. Bitcoins value comes from its decentralised network (something many other coins do not have - xrp being one of them). I agree that it is the most refined abstraction of what money is - a true token of value. I use it to buy things quite often, so it’s very much a real, useable, borderless currency. I never use an exchange and often see people on here advising others not to either. Think you’re just running with one aspect of the design (trading). I think Satoshi intended it to appeal to human nature by building in a way for early adopters to be massively rewarded, but that’s not the end-game.

It's not 1% any more Derek60. 26 people have the same amount of wealth as 3,700,000,000. If that doesn't make you baulk, then I'm not sure you grasp the gravitas (I'm not saying you don't - just makes me think you don't). They DO control the money system - who controls the national banks and who do they give their newly printed money to? Who has the power to create debt based on no actual holdings? You? Me? Fiat as it's currently realised is a massively unfair system. Please do some reasearch on this. Bitcoin is decentralised - no one can print any more at will.

Flip man, I show you a fact, and you come back with "USD doesn't know percentage" after realising the percentage you fed was double what it actually is. The US is a fantastic country and plenty of wonderful things come from it, but it's outperformed by other countries by many metrics and an increasing number of countries are refusing to "follow US rules". Why should they? Please try to not be so short-sighted, because you're limiting yourself. The world is bigger than the US. Bitcoin is an improvement over any fiat currency (including my own £) due to it being decentralised.

US military spending is at 649 billion dollars. No other country comes close and it’s actually more than the next eight countries military spending budgets combined.

Honestly, it’s a pretty cool story - I was a bit taken aback when I first read about La Roux, so I did some research and realised that the timelines just don’t work. My advice is to do some research into what Satoshi was doing (post times, accidentally sending test transactions from a Californian IP, etc) and how much actual work went into creating Bitcoin and compare that to what La Roux was doing at the same time (I mean time zones as well as periods of time). You’ll see that it’s just not possible.
It’s really good you’re looking into this and not just taking things for granted, but don’t just look into La Roux, look into what we know about Satoshi as well.
There’s a forum about Satoshis posting times above to get you started.

Where did you buy this coffee with BTC and when was that? I buy stuff with it now, but usually only bigger items (over $50 worth) via a third party on Amazon. It’s great because you always get a flat 27% discount off everything. I understand your frustration though, looking forward to the day I can spend BTC anywhere.

I don't quite get your Bundy analogy. What I'm saying is that it's easily verifiable that Satoshi was pulling in ten hour shifts daily via his regular posting and communications with co developers in a time zone which aligns with someone living on the west coast of the US. At the same time, La Roux was running a criminal empire from the Philippines.

Not buying it. Satoshis posts when he was communicating, were regularly between the hours of 3pm and 2am GMT, which would put him inside the US for the two years while Bitcoin was being developed. He rarely posted anything outside of these times. La Roux was living in the Philippines at this time. So basically, La Roux would have to do all his crime during the day and then spend the entire night building Bitcoin for two years without any sleeping.

Never had a problem with any of about 20 purchases. The Purse.io team are based in Pheonix I think and seem to be on top of any potential issues. You just paste in an item from your Amazon wish list and pay the BTC to Purse.io. They hold it until you confirm the package is in front of you and then release it to the buyer. Your address isn’t visible to the buyer as it’s handled through the Amazon wish list system. I’ve used them for a few £300+ purchases (£100 off felt great!)

He's not Satoshi. La Roux was living in Manila while Satoshi was developing bitcoin daily during hours which suggests he/she was in the US. For a good nine months or so, Satoshi was pulling in full-day shifts (about 10 hours per) working on bitcoin and communicating with other developers about the project. If he was doing it from Manila and then after hours - carrying out all the murdering, crime and overlording Le Roux was doing at the time, he wouldn't have slept at all for about a year.

Oh wow, was it the Old Shoreditch Station? You must have been an extremely early adopter way back in 2013 (hats off to you) - BTC was at $100 in 2013 and a $5 coffee back then is equivalent to $430 today. I can only imagine that BTC has made you staggeringly rich, given how early you were using it!

A decentralised value transaction network using units which cannot be faked or quantitatively eased at the whim of a corrupt bank - the first truly digital global currency, existing outside of political control and allowing an individual full ownership of their own money. Looks like value to me.

Good on you on having the foresight to be part of the early crowd. The 2013 crew must all have hundreds of thousands in fiat by now given its almost 100 times the worth of whatever they put in. If you’re not annoyed about paying $430 for a cup of coffee, you must have invested big!
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:14:21
I looked this up early on because it seemed too good to be true. Looks like the buyers are people around the world who do work for Amazon (maybe the Amazon Turks thing?).

Why are you talking to Turkish men you don’t know the name of in gyms about crypto and then spending a chunk of time on Internet forums telling everyone that they’re wrong?

Choose 2. It’ll get easier after a bit of practice.

Yeah it’s true what you say. Loads of western apps and websites are blocked and it’s frustrating for a foreigner living there. Locals don’t seem bothered though as they have equivalent services for Netflix, Google etc and sometimes these apps are massively better. Sure, I bet their government monitor all of the use - but I reckon plenty of that goes on here in the west. The fake food and baby formula stories you refer to are highly illegal, I recall the guy who messed about with the baby formula was executed. Pollution is shocking over there and the reason I left. However, look at how quickly they’ve pulled their whole country out of famine levels of poverty to being a world superpower. They’ve got high speed maglev trains running around their country, they’re building the biggest wind farms on Earth, they have a space station. These guys aren’t standing still. The most surprising thing for me was how little true communism I saw, the UK is more socialist in many ways. In China it’s all about consumerism, business, marketing and money right now.
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:49:34
Ha! This would be the perfect way to bring Bitcoin down in the west. Link up stories between the creation of Bitcoin and a murdering criminal genius who happened to get arrested not long after the creator of bitcoin went quiet. I noticed how this point was emphasised in the wiki page along with the many references to this guy being racist - so many reasons to dislike this guy (opioid crisis, racism, apparently violent to women). Plenty of fodder for the media to give the masses to repeat until no one wants to touch Bitcoin. Maybe this one’s a slow burner to give the story legitimacy? Oh and Solotshi sounds like Satoshi, so it must be the guy. Inane bollocks. I bet a study of their communications would show its clearly two different people.

Yes, it's a fairly clear illustration of why ideologies + power can be very dangerous things - be they religious or political. However, Chinese poverty rates have dropped from 88% to 6.9% today, and the mass famines in the 60's are impossible to imagine now. Think of all of the misery that's saved.

Ah right, I see. The ability to transfer bitcoin without an internet connection is being worked on (see Blockstream Satellite tech). I expect the internet on a global scale would continue fine-ish as per its design. Sorry about being full-on with my answer, and it’s good that you’re questioning potential issues with the tech, it’s just that ‘What if electricity stops working?’ is a common criticism thrown at Bitcoin. In a war scenario with the grid coming on and off, Bitcoin as is currently is would be a challenge to use in that locale. But, if you’re escaping a war zone, I’d much rather be trying to get out with all my wealth locked away in my 20 word seed in my brain than a wheelbarrow of gold. Fiat money would probably be useless in that scenario too.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:27:45
Imagine a world without electricity - then imagine caring in the slightest about credit cards, checks, shop vouchers, paper money, PayPal, crypto money, diamond rings, even gold coins in that apocalyptic nightmare. Salt. That’s what you’re going to be trading as you survive scavenging and hunting for your dinner. Not sure how all of the solar, hydro and wind farms are going to stop working at the same time the coal and nuclear power stations go down in your scenario though?
Edit: But, just to set your mind at ease, satellite nodes in space and solar powered hardware wallets.

Bitcoin consumes 30 terrawatt hours per year - banking consumes 100 terrawatt hours. Even if bitcoin expands to 100 times its market size, it would still equal around 2% of energy use. At the same time, China flushes away enough generated hydroelectricity to power the UK and Germany completely due to badly designed grid infrastructure. May as well use some of that to mine some coin?

AOL - in the early days of the internet, restricted its users to only being able to access its own content in a ‘walled garden’ version of the internet (centralised network). After this ended, AOL changed over to providing access to the actual World Wide Web (decentralised network), which had been running before AOL and continues to run after AOL is pretty much dead as an ISP. AOL isn’t the first application of the internet. Bitcoin is a protocol (not a private product), just like the internet is.

There are 32 million bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin currently uses 0.5% of global electricity. As I said, increasing the network size by a factor of 100 would only increase energy usage 4 times - the energy requirements aren’t going to grow massively. A lot more electricity is being flushed away daily by crap grid infrastructure. Starbucks accepts it for coffee and my last transaction took a few minutes and cost pennies. Lightning network takes seconds. On top of this, world banking has cost a lot of unquantifiable problems for a lot of people in the last couple of decades - I vote to reduce the power of banks.
Also, 3.7 billion of the people you’re talking about aren’t deemed eligible to have bank accounts by the almighty world banking system. Guess what they don’t need permission to set up to allow them to transact currency digitally? Yep - a Bitcoin wallet.

Just don’t try to day trade it and you’re fine. It’s not really about the trading for me, it’s the beauty of an elegantly designed system which could revolutionise how we see money and change our concept of borders. It’s use and value come from it being the first truly global currency, it being impossible to fake, being massively divisible, decentralised, finite like gold - so that it cannot be devalued by quantative easing, extremely easy to store and transport, not subject to transaction restrictions (you can buy what you like from who you like) and not being controlled by a corrupt organisation who has the power to print more when it feels like it. I find a lot of value in it.
@_date: 2019-05-24 21:35:17
1. First true global currency, borders are less of an issue
2. Decentralised, so not subject to corruption from a single agent
3. Finite - so not subject to devaluation through quantative easing from a greedy national bank
4. Available to the 50% of the world who can’t get bank accounts - as long as they can find an internet connection every so often
5. You are able to carry out any transactions you want with your money without a bank asking what you’re doing, blocking it or freezing your account if they feel like it
Sorry, I can’t stop myself...
6. You cannot make a counterfeit bitcoin
7. It is invisible, I could cross a border naked and have £300 million in BTC stored in a word seed in my brain
8. More secure than traditional banking in terms of identity fraud
9. No need to constantly exchange currencies when crossing borders - you can just spend BTC (albeit in a limited way for now)
10. The bitcoin network has never failed, unlike all major centralised payment networks (paypal, visa, MasterCard etc)

How are they dependant on the banking system when they’re not allowed a bank account? They use paper/coin fiat and exchange things like mobile phone minutes. Government fiat is the biggest ponzi scheme in history. Decoupled from gold and constantly devalued while the banks have the power to magic up more whenever they wish.
