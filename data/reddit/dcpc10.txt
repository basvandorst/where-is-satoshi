They don't give it away for free, they using more effective methods of generating revenue- ads, sponsors, packaged software, etc which are actually a whole lot more smarter at the current point in time.
There is also the trust factor, good luck convincing the world to better understand cryptocurrencies or 'hedge volatility' as an independent software developer. Believe me, Facebook never sells your personal data, I swear! /s

I don't think it is realistic as a real monetization method because of
1. The lack of knowledge and exaggerated amounts of fear regarding cryptocurrencies and how they work.
2.The lack of sustainability over the long term, bitcoin could be worth significantly more or less tomorrow - pretty difficult to pay developers knowing that.
Plus there is the whole 'bitcoin mining' = 'malware' thing that the media promotes. Various mobile apps have tried btc mining and they were hated on and banned.

Should I just do things the way coinbase does it?
Basically let users have 60 second timer to send their btc to somebody (public address), and then for every second that passes check whether the transaction was made to the correct address? It is possible to do that using Chain.

I just realized that my question comes down to guidelines set by Apple in a sense. Do you know if Apple allows non-wallet bitcoin apps AKA apps that allow users to send bitcoin to addresses in order to facilitate the payment of an item/service?
I wouldn't want to create anothet wallet. I am writing from a mobile device so I hope this is not too incoherent.
