i cant even find words to describe that chart. but yeah i knew it was risky but i have hindsight now so i dont know what i was thinking. i agree that no one knows what will happen. i have a belief there is a need for an instrument like btc, so its my belief that it wont suffer the same fate, but i can imagine possibilities where it could

i answered in the original post. i definitely let a mix of emotions and thinking i could predict the future get the best of me. if one thing good came out i think i learned a lot of valueable investment lessons.

copied from another comment i made to the same question.
I learned not to buy hype. I heard a saying if you taxi driver is talking about a stock, its time to sell. I didnt believe that because I thought hype would keep pushing it higher. I learned not to sell off everything. Sell a little so you have something if it goes down but don't exit entirely when things are going up. I also learned not to go all in on a speculation, because its a speculation which means you can be wrong. However now that I have hindsight its really easy for me to see everything I did wrong and realize how dumb I was. This makes it really hard to put myself back in my shoes a month ago and understand why I made the decisions I did.

its not the same boat. there are two boats. i am in both. the stock hit stung a little but  isnt even compareable to crypto losses. that could change in a few weeks. hopefully it does not but as of right now its worlds apart. i do agree on the strategy tho

i kept thinking this had to be the top and it couldnt go any farther. then when it actually was the top my logic was this has proved me wrong each time, i guess it really can keep going up. i actually did try to buy a small amount when it was 4k just to see what would happen but my banks fraud department tripped and stopped the purchase. I thought of that as a sign or some sort of divine intervention and didnt try again.

im gonna hodl to the end now.  im trying to consider the entire investment gone at this point so i stop thinking about it. 
i will admit tho, i got too greedy and i only half followed the rules. its a big setback on my savings but its not enough that my bills will be unpaid. Im just gonna have be frugal till i can build it back up.
however, i really do believe in the technology and believe in the need for a decentralized financial instrument.
