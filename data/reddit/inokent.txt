Decentralized and immutable. Thats two things on the top of my head that bitcoin has vs. traditional systems. Isnt this kind of the point? Being able to replicate todays traditional systems with those features would be a great achievement imo.
I dont know much about these altcoins, but the ones I have taken a look into always seem to lack at some crucial part that gets overshadowed by its 'amazingness'.

Because there are strengths in numbers and people like keeping their money safe. None of these altcoins come close to being as resistant.
I dont think there is much more than speculation and "get rich fast" people in the altcoin space. Not speaking for everyone ofcource but thats my general observation. Buuubbly stuff.

Maybe a slight block increase would lead to more centralization than LN. But you have to look at all the effects, and a block increase is simple linear scaling.. Not worth the centralization it brings.

This argument is so terribly stupid. With the same logic you should be hating yourself for buying anything with anything. You couldve bought and stored bitcoin instead, ffs!
If you use bitcoin instead of fiat to buy stuff that makes zero difference. However, the amount of your bitcoin SAVINGS you use on coffee or pizza, you might regret later on.  The same way you regret using your savings on bullshit in general, it just stings a bit harder.

Localbitcoins is based on reputation, so if there is decent activity in your country there should be someone trustworthy. I use localbitcoins everytime, no problem. Just dont pick the cheapest dude with no rep, if you are worried.
If you buy bitcoins on localbitcoins, the vendors bitcoins get locked in escrow. So a potential scam can also be disputed.

I discovered bitcoin in early march 2016 through a legit use case. It took a couple weeks before I actually took the interest in the how it worked.
This amazed me. As a CS student and big nerd, this system amazed me. I saw the value in it immediately. 
With a background in selling virtual game coins (wow gold etc), I have felt the struggle dealing with systems like PayPal. Back then I was thinking a lot about the inherent trust issues on the internet.. But as with many before me, I concluded it was impossible. (I was a kid, so its not like I actually knew shit).
Anyways, I havnt invested much in bitcoin. Ive used it a lot, and therefore store my wealth in btc regularly. But it rarely stays there, mainly because I dont really have money to spare (as a student), but my faith in bitcoin remains the same despite this volatility. You have to take the time to really understand bitcoin, as now, and the goals we are trying to achieve. Do you believe in layers? Lightning? There are more. If you actually have a bit of understanding and faith in these ideas and technologies, then there is nothing to worry about.
