This authentication approach strikes me as a huge opportunity for BTC.

When you log into Coinbase you should see a new wallet has been created with your BCH already deposited.  They rolled it out a few weeks ago, so customers have had access to the BCH coins for a while.

Trying to understand the math on scaling...Bitcoin network can handle 7 trx/sec; Visa can process 56,000 trx/sec.  For BTC to equal Visa trx volume using lightning, each transfer to the LN would have to include the equivalent of 8,000 LN transactions (56,000 trx/sec/ 7 trx/sec) If we assume a $10 average transaction size that would mean I have to transfer $80,000 each time I reload my lightning hot wallet for BTC to approach Visa trx volumes.  Is this correct?  Are there other optimizations that will improve on this?
BTW - I'm not convinced BTC needs to reach Visa trx volumes but I would like to understand what LN means for the network.

John wrote an in\-depth and thoughtful investment analysis of Bitcoin and crypto last December.  Doesn't make him right, but certainly suggests he has done the homework to support his thesis.  You should check it out.

What happens to transactions that never get confirmed?  The BTC transfers to the new key holder, but isn't this excluded from being publicly recorded?

I'm trying to use your service so I can withdraw pesos from an ATM while I'm in Mexico.  The website requires me to select a mobile service to send withdrawal information to, but my mobile service (AT&amp;T) is not listed.  Can you guys work with AT&amp;T?

Not an expert, but I believe in the US you will have taxes due at two points in time (ETH to BTC and BTC to USD.)

Assuming there is NO BU hardfork, and Segwit is NOT activated, what scaling options does the network have?  When can these options be implemented?

Great read!  Sums up a pretty good investment thesis.
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:46:27
Decent point.  You need a much higher BTC price / fee structure to make it feasible on a large scale.  Adding mining operations simply increases the competition for those bitcoins, making the return less appealing.

This is a killer app.  Worldwide energy is a massive market and this is a way to improve efficiency / store value of excess production.  BTC mining could become a valuable tool for power producers.

Yes.  $700 coins are cheap.

Not very impressive.  Expect more from Bain Capiatl MD.  Understanding of BTC seems shallow...banks can use blockchain to clear real money transactions...whatever.

Agree - The hassle factor of BTC for day to day transactions is still pretty high.  Nothing the mainstream is willing to endure.  However, the tech has utility which drives speculation.  Most people don't see it yet, but having a store of value outside the fiat system has real value IMO.  Future improvements in utility are a bonus.

This implies a $50-$100K BTC price.  Hold onto your coins boys and girls!

From my perspective this is scary as shit.  I am just getting to the point of telling high networth friends I am buying btc.  But there is no way to explain this mess to any of them.  IMHO NO "mainstream" investor will get significant (sic "any") exposure to btc without a solution.  We need to remove the uncertainty YESTERDAY!

It seems Onebit would have a good anti-trust argument.  Two companies with monopolistic control of the vendor payment system does not sound like a consumer friendly dynamic.
@_date: 2017-04-26 17:37:25
Help me understand.  Customers cannot withdraw USD from Bitfinex, so they have to buy BTC causing the price to go up.  Why wouldn't they transfer BTC to another wallet / exchange and sell for fiat.  This should only take a couple days at most and offset any price increase.  Am I missing something?
@_date: 2015-07-05 14:25:34
At some point transaction fees have to provide the incentive for miners to secure the network.  Doesn't tx volume and cost matter then?
@_date: 2015-07-09 18:24:35
Agree.  Buying BTC (and getting money from tranditional banking system into your brokerage account), is still pretty limited for large investors.  For a billionaire to get 1% exposure to BTC requires a $10,000,000 position.  It's tough getting this when you can only purchase $10,000 per day.  It would take almost 3 years.
Does anyone know if the same limits apply to selling BTC and/or transfering cash out of brokerage to a bank account?

Thank you.  I have an Apple...Any experience with the Android app?
Seems a mobile app bitcoin node option would be a good tool to get non-tech bitcoin supporter to run a node.  It certainly would make it easier to get my friends to do it.

Bitcoin and medical marijuana have similar issues...I recently opened a business checking account at Wells Fargo and the rep flat out told me that they would not open the account if it was for a Bitcoin related business.

Is it possible to create a mobile device app that runs a Bitcoin node? Is it feasible to run a node this way, or completly crazy? I understand there is not enough HD storage on mobile devices, but maybe this can be augmented with cloud storage?

Not too surprising.  He bought about $2.5M of BTC at $350 per coin when his hedge fund was about $90M, or about 3% of assets.  BTC goes from $350 to $6,000 and now represents ~$43M of his $154M fund.  Presto 30%.  Question is, will he HODL this level of exposure?

No.  You can load the card using any BTC wallet.

I admit, not a real strong use case.  I suspect that will change.

BTC allows you to cross boarder easily with a large amount of value that does not have to be declared and cannot be confiscated.  The article states that this is becoming more difficult with gold and silver.

I think the endgame is for ATMs, BTMs, etc. to just go away.  Why mess with cash, coins, etc. if you can just bump a pmt with your smartphone or wallet?

Yep.  And you can walk across the border with a thousand coins in your briefcase on a slip of paper.

His original paper “An (institutional) Investors Take on Crypto Assets” is very good.  I agree with his view that utility token values will trend toward the marginal value of the service provided by the network whereas SoV tokens have an opportunity appreciate dramatically as they become accepted as SOVs.  He is basically arguing the one (BTC?) or perhaps a few SoV tokens will rule them all.

Depending on when he bought in 2014, bitcoin could be 5% or 10% of his net worth now.  I think I read his net worth is ~$600M.
