What I was trying to say was I bought at 67 USD a few days ago and the price is now 110. I was mislead into thinking I could cancel the transaction if needed but apparently I can not.
Edit: wow 119$ now

No need to try and convince him any farther if he is being unreasonable. If Bitcoin blows up in the future he will know and wish he had listened. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:58:03
but.. what was the question? 
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:01:00
Also anyone with these "success story's" were mostly just lucky..
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:04:53
Same with me. They actually emailed me back within hours informing me I had been whitelisted. I have not received my coins yet but I am confident I will by the date they provided.

Thank you for taking the time to make a video.

I may not know enough but I have always had good luck with the SpendX option. Usually getting the amount I was hoping for instantly. But I have been trading on a small scale (under 1 BTC) if that makes any diffrence.

I too would like to see this.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:36:50
Well the first dead giveaway was that they used CNN. CNN would NEVER actually do background research into Bitcoin. They would get some moron to write something like "Internet hacker creatz cyber coinz and the coinz  are used by 14 year olds to buy da methamphetamine on the interwebz." "Hey is this article good enough to publish?" CNN- FUCK YES DO IT NOW..
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:31:51
He planned it!! invious you devious person..
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:01:09
Damn I wish I knew this a couple days ago.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:23:25
Ok so who should we buy from? Mtgox will take weeks to get set up..
@_date: 2013-04-19 17:10:30
CNN needs to stop..
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:34:30
I decided to bite the bullet and enter my ssn a couple days ago and have yet to receive the confirmation transactions in my bank account, but apparently this is common.
@_date: 2013-04-26 14:20:26
Ok, I may have been wrong when I said "anyone". What I should have said is most.
@_date: 2013-04-26 23:01:53
A true Spartan. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:50:17
unfortunately its almost impossible to tell what its going to do next.
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:27:18
You could use CampBX while waiting for your mtgox verification. They accept Dwolla. It takes weeks to get a verified Mtgox account.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:27:55
Will look into. What is your opinion on CampBX?
