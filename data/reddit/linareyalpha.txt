Private banks can't 'print' money, that's illegal. Only Central banks can do that and be sure: The protocols are strict AF as a minor slip can destroy the economy (see modern Venezuela / post-war China / hyperinflation Germany / 100 trillion Mozambique bill). 
What private banks can do is 'create' money with the reserve coefficients. Easy example: Imagine you have a hundred dollars and you put them in an account. The bank is going to use part of that money to lend it to other people, and the total amount is going to depend on the reserve coefficients. If those are a 10%, the bank is going to have 10 of your dollars in the strongbox and will lend 90 dollars. You would still have 100 dollars, as you can retire them whenever you want, and the borrower 90 for a total of 190. If the borrower saves those 90 dollars, the process repeats to a total amount of 271 and so on. The maximum potential money the bank could create in ideal conditions is defined by M=m/Cr. In this case, M=100/10%=1000$. 
But that would also happen with BTC. If you save part of your BTC in any financial institution (as everyone would probably do with mass adoption), that financial institution would probably reserve part of your BTC and lend the other part and here is the 'problem' again. Unless you want to destroy the modern financial system (and that seems pretty... Impossible. Some actors of the market have fund big enough to buy entire countries without hesitation), solving the 'money creation' 'problem' is out of question. 
I support cryptos for other reasons. But no: Banks aren't going anywhere.

The banks don't allow that, but the government via regulations. If you obtain the licenses to operate as a bank, you can also 'create' money with the reserve system.

We are in a different part of the bull circle. The hyper-acceleration will come sooner or later, but now the grows will be constant and "moderate" (for the standards of BTC. If this year's chart was seen by a stock financial, his head would blow)

You have to declare your benefits from crypto investments the same way you would with stocks. Otherwise it could easily be seen as money laundering.

The last time Bitcoin exploded was after an hyper-acceleration cycle. BTC became popular and everyone wanted to buy, so the price pumped very hard and the price broke the channel, leading to a cycle of massive increase in the price action. 
I have all my tools prepared to detect the next cycle. It will probably last a few weeks and then bear market. That's why it is important to detect it and know when to short sell (without falling in a correction trap)

Fun because I have far better returns than their their portfolios xD

They can 'create' money, not bills and coins. The only organization capable of that labor is the Central Bank, which also determines de reserve coefficients to regulate the amount of money in the market.

That guy would write a good post-apocalyptic book. 
If BTC mining starts to grow beyond limits, it wouldn't be carzy if governments around the world banned it. In a planet where all the energy came from the wind and the sun there wouldn't be much problems, but most of the energy nowadays come from fosil fuels. That amount of electricity wasted wouldn't be sustainable both for the planet and the electricity consumers.

1-Most of the hedge funds and so on legally can't invest in Crypto, at least in Spain.
2-Even if they could, their clients would say "no" and newspapers would crush them.
3-Anyone with the minimum financial knowledge would burst out laughing if their heared "hedge" and "BTC" in the same phrase. 
I know you all are hyped. I am too. But for the sake of god, calm down. This euphoria was the reason why many people lost a huge amount of money in the last bull run.

Every coin is green, up around a 10%. BTC 7.7k (coinmarketcap).
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:12:32
With BTC at 20k we had a total market cap (altcoins included) of 800 billion USD (moreless, i do not remember well). If BTC reached 500k that would mean that the total market cap (assuming the altcoins would follow) of around forty trillion dollars (bad mental algebra).
That's more than twice the american GDP. Imagine EEUU with all their industry, all their services... for two years in a row just to equal the market cap of crypto.
Is it possible? Yeah. Do i find it plausible? Not really. That would be too much. Maybe i am infravalorating the market, but guys, i think that we must calm ourselves: The price has increased 4k in six months and we are already calling for a 493k pump. Just calm, trade the money you don't need and wait. Be sensible, please, don't do anything stupid.
PD: If btc reaches 500k i'll use all the money i've gained to buy a bunker full of food. The mining will probably destroy the planet in around a week XD.

Many BTC buyers from the 20k run were probably waiting for the 6k resistance to be broken in order to buy. And now they are thworing their money the the screen as hard as they can XD
