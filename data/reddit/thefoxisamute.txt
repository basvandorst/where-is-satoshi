Learn how to make a paper wallet and get your bitcoins off of any online wallet service.  They are hackable.

This will be me, my friends and family.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:57:25
For instance, I bought my bitcoins at 200 dollars.  I could now go spend half my bitcoins and still be in the same situation financially. 
I'd have less bitcoins but they are actually worth the same as they were when I bought them for 200 bucks.  
Therefore, I'm actually encouraged to spend.  I could then turn back around and sell that stuff and be in a better situation than when I started and STILL have enjoyed the stuff I bought.

I've NEVER had a problem with Coinbase.  It's just panicky noobs that mostly make these posts. 
Experienced folks do the same thing and never admit when they are wrong after coinbase corrects a problem.  It really is disgusting.
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:59:07
Dude this DOES NOT sound like it's from coinbase.  This is an attempt to steal your password I think.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:11:55
Conspiracy Theory: 
 The folks at Ripple(Google) have organized this to make Ripple the accepted way to move bitcoin around in the fist stage of attempting to kill bitcoin and keep a control on money production.
Perhaps the Federal Reserve will also push Ripple.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:46:16
The real truth is in scenarios like this, there are many, many instances of the blockchain and if it were determined that a 51% attack were taking place, there would simply be a fork and everyone would go with the honest chain.
That's not taken care of by the protocol but by honest people that care about the integrity of the ledger.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:10:29
Honestly I think coinbase would actually mail you.  I'd just contact them and see if it's a hoax.
@_date: 2013-11-12 05:13:13
There is a lot of resistance from people that just don't seem to want it to work.

@_date: 2013-11-12 21:17:31
Yes it's like a bank going out of business without FDIC insurance.
There are NO current exchanges or wallets in my opinion where you should leave your bitcoins long term.
You exchange and then you send them to an address only you are in control of.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:40:06
I disagree with you completely.  The moment exchanges open up fiat to alts, you'll see a LOT of alts grow.  
These alts have nice communities and a lot of support behind them.
No one will EVER unseat Bitcoin but there will be others that help support it.  They all give one another ideas and the alts are very good testing grounds for ideas that bitcoin might like to experiment with but doesn't want to risk.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:20:03
Perhaps you can tell him that gold can actually be created and the processes to do this will become cheaper and cheaper.  It is a nuclear reaction but is possible.

It looks like Coinbase uses google for their mx servers.
coinbase.com    MX preference = 10, mail exchanger = aspmx.l.google.com
coinbase.com    MX preference = 30, mail exchanger = aspmx4.googlemail.com
coinbase.com    MX preference = 20, mail exchanger = alt2.aspmx.l.google.com
coinbase.com    MX preference = 30, mail exchanger = aspmx3.googlemail.com
coinbase.com    MX preference = 20, mail exchanger = alt1.aspmx.l.google.com
coinbase.com    MX preference = 30, mail exchanger = aspmx2.googlemail.com
coinbase.com    MX preference = 30, mail exchanger = aspmx5.googlemail.com

The government already takes approaching half of most peoples income by the time ALL taxes are added up.
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:16:35
I'd also say they can offer bitcoin ideas.  For instance GoldCoin, has a unique 51% protection no other coin has.  If it proves to work out, bitcoin can simply steal it.  Peercoin has a proof of stake component that bitcoin may also be able to steal.  
Talent borrows, genius steals.   It's the open source way.
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:42:35
This is a case where bitcoin can look to altcoins for solutions.  Both Feathercoin and GoldCoin have implemented unique 51% protection solutions.
If either of these turn out to be any good, bitcoin can just adopt them.
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:16:16
Correct me if I'm wrong here but let's say some group gets to decide which coin is valid or not.  Doesn't this just really give them the power to validate their own money (be their own printing press) and invalidate everyone elses?
So if this is true, it's not much different than our current system.

The counter argument is this:
You have bought X bitcoins.  You would like to see their value rise.  You have to buy goods and services with fiat anyhow.  
Why not first buy bitcoin and use those to buy goods and services since helping grow the bitcoin economy will increase the value of your X bitcoins?

It depends on where you live.  I live in the US and I use coinbase.com.
You could check localbitcoins.com and maybe meet up with someone that has some and trade money/goods/services for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:36:34
Regardless of what you think of bitcoin succeeding.  There will never, ever be another currency created that is taken seriously if it's not based on cryptography and p2p.
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:50:54
There is nothing wrong with deflation.  Now it's something that is anticipated.  So, you won't lose your job, you'll just get paid less which is ok because the price of everything will keep going down.
You just have to see everything in reverse.  
So everyone willl be willing to take less for goods and services because they know the value of the money will go up.
@_date: 2013-11-16 05:50:54

I've heard a lot of mouth from Russia on RT.com but I haven't seen them pushing bitcoin.

Also, in order to be a registered miner, you have to pay 100,000 bitcoins.  Any bitcoins created by non-registered miners are black listed.
Does that sound like a good idea too?

Put every damn dime you can scrounge into bitcoin and roll the fucking dice.  Get a second and third job just to put more money in.

Does he still rent or did the bubble cause him to stay out of the housing market forever?  That's what he's saying with bitcoin.  Bitcoin isn't a bubble.  Just like the housing market isn't a bubble.  There are bubbles in both markets though.  It doesn't make the underlying entity intrinsically bad.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:04:20
It IS a scam.  They wouldn't have you restore your account.  Look at the smtp headers.  See where the email actually came from.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:03:16
Coinvalidation is something some scam company is trying to do to centralize who has control over bitcoin.  They are playing a dangerous game and their identities are already out there for everyone to see. 
I would imagine those with a lot of money to lose from this will not sit idly by.  If I were this current company, I would close shop immediately and try opening something up down the road from now anonymously.
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:50:48
Fear and Greed.  I'm sure they've already bought some at a much, much lower price just in case.

@_date: 2013-11-16 04:25:12
Probably just a difference between receive and send.
@_date: 2013-11-13 05:11:13
Awesome.  You need to add this to the bitcoin merchants over on the sidebar.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:38:55
Sure buy some.  It will likely go up in price because most people can't tell the difference between a company that has total control of the payment system and a decentralized system like bitcoin.
Heck they might convince a lot of people that they are on the up and up and the end goal isn't to give control of a huge financial system to just a few people.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:19:56
I'd say since they are buying a ton of bitcoins, have a bunch of miners and the state is running videos about bitcoin that they are not blocking it.
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:34:25
Coinbase is the safest online wallet around.  However, use a paper wallet.  It's still the wild, wild west out there.

You might want to see how it encrypts it.  You can likely find a decryptor for windows or linux that will just ask for the password.
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:43:18
After this is implemented.  We should go further.  Any bitcoins that have ever moved from a criminal address should be invalidated.
After that any bitcoins that are not purchased from one group of miners or one set of exchanges.  We should make the miners register.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:42:58
The market is different now.  There is more acceptance.  The upside growth potential is actually far greater as we're fast approaching 10 percent acceptance.
It will likely never drop below 300 again and may struggle to go below 350 Mt. Gox.

I'd say to do a who.is on the ips that are in the smtp header and see if you see anything odd.

Bitcoin is an ocean in a box.  Someone built and opened the box releasing the water in waves.  Wave after wave the water deepens.  New life is springing forth with each wave.
Some would have the box closed but the world now knows how to build the box and soon the whole planet will be covered with water.

They are bound by it like everyone else.  They just think through much, much better than other companies.
Their integration of Google+ with Youtube is a recent disaster where their greed screwed them but I think they've realized their mistake.

@_date: 2013-11-15 13:53:43
You could also think of deflation as you would be willing to spend money now because you know the remaining money you have will be worth more in the future, so it's almost as though you haven't lost any total value in buying something.  Your net assets are the same but now you have more stuff.
