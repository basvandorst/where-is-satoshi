please note it is actually not OkCoin itself, OkCoin exports some necessary resource and experience to a team and let them try.

As a Tokyo resident, could I make some effort to help? I can speak fluent Japanese, English and Chinese. Also, I collected 80+ Chinese victims' information and working on a personal process to sue mtgox, so possibly could join you?

Hello, was just busy during the past weeks and late for some update. I want to say, our team(known as OkCoin/BitOcean) is just trying best to make something happen and we are now proposing an investigation plan to Kobayashi-san(trustee).
Due to lack of time, we cannot post each detailed update here but to keep everyone involved, please kindly check this bbs, now with the following URL
Most of the things were posted in Chinese before but from now on I will try best to make English posts. Lao_Ban_ also will help with that.

They are the 4th biggest mining pool in the world, thus so far I trust them a lot.
