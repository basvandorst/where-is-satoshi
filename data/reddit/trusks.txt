Thanks, but they ask for a lot of info for just a $3 donation. A QR code on the front page would make it so much easier...
@_date: 2014-11-03 01:16:41
Would like to try it out as well.

If only we had a RELIABLE source to where in the world the BTCs are going...
@_date: 2014-12-27 02:42:03
Where is Circle and Coinbase during this tipping frenzy????
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:20:03
Newbie question here, everyday more than 3.000 btc are mined, and sent to the exchanges right? When will this number be cut in half?
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:21:42
Where is everybody, theres a lot of people over  at     asking a lot of questions...
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:20:33
So the top 100 has more than 10.000 btc each? crazy...

Im sorry, but this is scary. Imagine 95% of the population trying to buy a device to store their coins, most of them wont be able to make it. I think that you guys are too smart, and everything is so easy. When i even try to tell somebody about buying a device so that the coins wont be stollen they give me that look.. "whaaaattt."  I went to get a hair cut last week in northern NJ in a pretty big city, there was like 8 young people there with their brand new smartphones and i couldnt resist the urge to ask one of the workers there if he ever heard about Bitcoin and was so funny their reaction. One said: "yeah, i heard one of their CEO is in jail"  the other said: " i saw that somebody lost millions in that investment" and thing like that... But like i said, you guys wont understand... 
I would like to see a poll, of every 50 people that you talk about bitcoin, how many would at least pretend they care and read something about it...
Anyway, I guess I changed the subject a little.

Whatever the guy does he will be criticized. So why not just leave it alone. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 19:47:55
That means that last year there was a lot of manipulation going on...
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:46:14
Also  Ellen Degeneres might be good.  
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:46:34
Yeah, but on the front page of wiki only says CREDIT CARD&lt; PAYPAL&gt;AMAZON. So most likely the people that dont know that reddit exists, dont know that you have to look for other ways to give. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 03:37:24
While Coinbase and Circle are nowhere to be found...
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:49:54
Or  "CHANGEtip the easiest way to send love(money) online." or whatever...
@_date: 2014-12-17 04:08:33
I find it very hard to "make" people believe in bitcoin when the price of one is more than 300 dollars. My friends and family dont know shit about technology and think im crazy buying a piece of digital stuff for more then 300, 500, 700s. So probably forgetting about 1 whole bitcoin and suggesting them to buy 100 bits for like $50, $25 might be easier.  
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:30:24
heres 1000 bits   @_date: 2014-12-18 21:21:35
I thought i didnt know shit about bitcoin, BUT this guy is terrible. OMG!!!
@_date: 2014-12-09 03:16:55
There you guys have it, the Bitcoin celebrity. Simple, funny and effective.
@_date: 2014-11-17 10:46:39
Problem is, people still dont know about Bitcoin and "NOBODY" knows about ChangeTip. Theres a need for a big time celebrity, or a tv show to promote it, people are lazy and dont even google the name, thinking it is a spam. But pretty sure their company already knows about these and is waiting for the right time for a aggressive marketing campaing.
@_date: 2014-11-06 22:38:14
They have to translate their website to other languages as soon as possible.
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:30:55
It is very hard indeed, people that dont know anything about it love to tell me that the price is going down or show me articles saying bs about bitcoin. Probably the big miners are afraid of going really DOWN and are dumping, since theyre still making profit?? Or a lot of big investors got out and are waiting to see signs of bottom.who knows...

Heres a coffee @_date: 2014-12-08 20:21:21
Watched a couple times already, just unbelievable funny and helpful.
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:20:56
Merry Xmas. Although i dont understand most of the stuff here, i really enjoy coming here and reading your posts...
@_date: 2014-12-13 23:51:58
People tend to be hostile towards the unknown, its easier to point fingers and accuse... We are more inclined to say NO in life.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:52:35
All we need is a big time celebrity to talk about CHANGETIP and thats it...BOOMM!!!
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:25:36
Going broke on this tipping extravaganza, want to pay  a beer for all the people i "know".
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:41:18
whatever they are doing its working really well, more than a 1000 r/bitcoin subscribers in a few days. Feels so good to tip a few cents easily for things you like.
@_date: 2014-11-07 01:02:51
i love galo mineiro

With Bitcoin you're your own Bank, you are Paypal, you are Western Union and have the magnificent ability to send REAL money instantly for over 6 Billion people in the planet. Devote a few hours of your life to learn more about BITCOIN, the soon the better, since you will be the ones building the infrastructure around it.
@_date: 2014-12-08 14:33:00
Just awesome!!!
@_date: 2014-12-13 00:35:15
Most likely Bitpay is paying them in USD right away,  soon Microsoft will buy Bitpay, so it doesnt matter.
@_date: 2014-12-10 13:08:17
This is HUGE worldwide, i just dont understand why its taking so long.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:09:51
When will we see a big company like MS advertise at least 5%  discount in using btc?  
When will a big company like MS buy Bitpay/changetip?
May that be the reversal? 
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:13:02
Most people are on debt, paying high interest rates on credit cards. Hard to  put aside $300+ on one btc and wait a couple years. Most likely some got in, lost due to the downtrend  and cashed out  to pay bills and uncertainty.  Out of 50 people that i talked about Bitcoin in the last 18months, only 2 bought btc and they must be feeling stupid for getting into this. I keep showing them positive stuff, otherwise they would've already left too.
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:40:28
All of a sudden the  WSJ have been ALL IN in bitcoin. That is Lunar indication.
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:08:19
Wolf Blitzer asking about bitcoin. I never thought I'd see that happen. Amazing.
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:29:25
Thats the place I would be advertising  and tipping people like crazy if I were from changetip, a real use for them... Theres still so much confusion overthere. We can see that some are trying to buy bitcoin but they just dont know how or cant figure it out...
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:17:08
Merry Xmas!!!
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:01:06
Exactly,  as I said before, people needs a incentive(discount ). 
It's the same argument over and over, pay percentage fees, wait a couple days, just to get the same price.
Imagine Samsung giving like 10% or more to people who buys their x product. Wouldn't be difficult for them to profit from investing in one of the btc companies.

FROM HIS POST:
With Sir Richard Branson
• Who is: Sir Richard Branson is 65 years old and is the founder of virgin group.
• What does: Virgin group is a group of international investment that has more than 360 companies and is one of the most recognized brands at a global level. Employs more than 50 thousand people in over 50 countries.
• What you talked about: Branson presented a programme on the control of drugs. In addition, he showed great interest in investing in Argentina and will visit the country this year.
• Why was it important this encounter: the president was very interested in the talk since Branson, in addition to the employer in areas related to new technologies, such as, for example space flights and the use of Bitcoin, is an entrepreneur in humanitarian issues.

Imagine the average Joe coming to reddit and all they see is: lost coins, stolen coins, hacked coins, exchange X is a scam... lol 
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:57:32
You're right.  I just tried to imagine coming to r/bitcoin for the first time and seeing all the posts about people "losing" their bitcoins...
