When are you going to sell is like asking when are you going to spend money. Never going to sell all, that would be like spending the bank account to zero. Will sell small portions when the money is needed. Will hold for life basically, and sell small portions on the way.

Yes! Although dont expect you'll become a millionaire. But investing this amount might get you interested in the technology and set you up for the future ahead of your peers. Think of nerds experiencing with internet when the majority was not bothered (yet).
Basically, it's inevitable so do it now!

We might be in a bubble short term but undervalued in long-term, who knows.
Looking at the chart won't make you any wiser because we're dealing with a new technology meaning the start point was basically zero --&gt; percentual increase is going to be huge.
Usually people say the stock market is in a bubble when the normal person gives you investment advice meaning everybody is in the market and buying.
This can't be applied to Bitcoin because even if the random persons are in the market and buying, you need to understand that normally the you and mes play an insignificant role of the total market (stocks, bonds, real estate..).
This is the first time **ever**, normal people have the opportunity to invest before the majority of millionaires / institutions.

market cap represents the ability of an asset to hold its value. low market cap is easy to get and retain as demonstrated by every shitcoin out there. when these assets increase in value they will get sold because everybody knows they are not worth anything in the long run - therefore not able to retain a large market cap. bitcoin, on the other hand is able to hold its value hence the largest market cap and why its a nice meaningful metric. though you might just mean the $number in market cap doesnt relate to any actual amount of money and that is correct.

Both had none intrinsic value to begin with. Gold was adopted as money because of its properties, 'stock to flow ratio' or *predictable increase in supply*. Bitcoin has perfect properties to be adopted as money but we are now on the early days and speculating if it will happen or not.
Not everybody thinks bitcoin is money and will be accepted as money in the future.
Everybody thinks gold is money and will be money in the future.
Thats the difference. Gold has the history and shared belief of the human population. Bitcoin has the belief of a small part of the population at this point. Bitcoin has minimal history compared to gold. If bitcoin sticks around and more and more people accept that this thing is money and wont go away - then bitcoin will win. It has nothing to do with intrinsic value.

who cares. dont hold tether and youll be fine. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:48:12
1. it is an equation and a requirement. like flip a coin - until you get 1000 heads in a row (dumb problem but hard to solve). the more people you have flipping coins simultaneously the faster you get somebody to accomplish.
2. requirement changes if solutions get found too quick or too slow. like flip a coin until 3000 heads in a row because 1000 heads in a row was too easy etc.
3. for the mining reward algorithm to change it would require a hardfork and then we would still have the normal bitcoin with 21 mil cap, and the new bitcoin with limit removed. the question becomes why would anyone value this new coin over the normal, especially as its the users who have the power to decide where they want to participate and they are also the ones holding the coins, no point shooting yourself in the leg.

you are now confusing terminology and real life. if you wanna short bitcoin, you have a couple of ways to do that. futures &amp; margin trading. bill gates cant 'short' and sell million of bitcoins that he doesnt own. he can set a futures contract though if he feels confident the price will drop.

@_date: 2018-05-11 11:29:41
No. In futures market, shorting is a contract in which you agree to sell at a certain price. No bitcoin is being sold when shorting.
In margin trading, money is being borrowed from the broker. No bitcoin is being sold when you margin trade and 'short'.
Only way to really short is to sell your Bitcoin if you have any.
Quite the contrary to what you think, when there are record amount of shorts vs. longs is usually a time when the price pumps, not crashes.
@_date: 2018-05-29 09:54:31
Good point
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:16:27
are you telling me you spend basically all fiat to buy bitcoin. and then spend that bitcoin to buy things? thats fine for you, but not something i wanna do. from my paycheck i use fiat for rent, food, transportation, bars, diapers, etc. and buy bitcoin with what i can save for the future. this is money that i dont plan to use, and if i would need to sell my btc, it is poor financial planning from me.
@_date: 2018-08-02 09:35:49
how much money youve spent? how much do you currently have?
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:22:54
Because if you have now 0.01% of the total distribution you will always have that same share of the bitcoin pile. This is not the case with fiat money where total amount keeps increasing and your amount keep representing a smaller share of the total amount

like leblue said. you can have ETFs tracking the s&amp;p500 thats also based only on futures, not holding any actual stocks.
From what I've seen, all of the Bitcoin ETFs are like this. and I'd say they're not very important for Bitcoin price. All it means is many people would have an easy way of 'investing' into Bitcoin when actually no Bitcoin is being sold.
It could actually slow down the hype if more people would end up buying these ETFs and less people buying actual Bitcoin.
On the other hand, I would be ok with it meaning I can buy more the actual good stuff with lower prices when random people waste their opprtunity to hodl an actual coin.

Because they are priced in btc. Therefore you should not even check the altcoin prices in dollar but in btc instead

You re right. Its inflationary and currently even more than usd. But after next halving it will be less inflationary than usd so you could say its deflationary compared to usd.

@_date: 2018-06-28 19:06:33
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:26:30
it is your loss. i cant imagine what has made you feel that way, but better to do some research for your sake.
i will give you something to think about. do you spend 100% of your salary? or do you save a portion? if you spend it all, month after month your situation is the same wealth-wise. if you save a portion, say 5%, this is money you dont touch but accumulate for the future. you continue to spend the rest 95% of your income. from my perspective, the 95% which is spent is not interesting - fiat or crypto, it will be gone anyway. but the 5% that will be saved for the future needs to be secure, decentralized, censorship resistant and inflation resistant. and btc wins it by a high margin

@_date: 2018-06-20 07:34:18
it goes up 10% and you sell, up 10% and you sell, up 10% and you sell, down 5% and you buy - you just lost btc because you sold 'too early' and ended up holding fiat when your btc was gaining value.
@_date: 2018-06-28 19:03:46
Im okay with the price but the percentage was 600% not too long ago so this is not exactly comforting
@_date: 2018-06-25 05:44:35
lets say its 'real value' is $1000 now and steady adoption would make it $2000 in x time, and $3k in xx time. you can now bet on the future and buy with the current price $1k as you know it will soon be worth $3k. but now with this behaviour the price will already take off from the 'real value' of $1k.
so, nobody knows the real value and it doesnt even matter because we already live in the future.
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:12:09

the amount of full nodes (decentralization) decreases with bigger blocks. you can look at the state of ethereum to get an idea. decentraization is the most important thing.
i disagree with the adoption part, i could definitely vision a great future for btc even with the current output. my usecase for decentralized money is having my wealth off from the control of central banks &amp; inflation. i dont care so much how i pay my groceries or beers. if i wanna save 10% from my salary i can put it to 'global cloud storage' that is not controlled by anybody. how i spend the 90% is not that interesting, its gone anyway - crypto or fiat.
just my point of view

@_date: 2018-06-04 08:01:25
it was never about speed&amp;fees, we already have visa/dollar. it is about fair money that is not controlled by anybody. we have 21 mil hard cap &amp; nobody can change it. you have your bitcoin and nobody can tell you what to do with it. we dont have a 'foundation' who kept xx% of the supply in the beginning. it just took off and spread organically to this point. it is relaxing to know that nobody can change the rules, bitcoin today will be bitcoin tomorrow. crazy persons can cry and fork off because they dont understand what is valuable in bitcoin.
all of the other coins have 'founders' and 'foundations'. they are making themselves rich, they can change circulation, change the rules, they rely on marketing to boost their coin. they will claim to be environmentally friendly but they will just hide the burden beyond hashrate and make themselves vulnerable in the process. bitcoin is awesome because it uses the electricity it does (uses, not wastes), it is not wasteful. we have used resources and polluted the environment for years mining gold. valuable things need effort, bitcoin doesnt hide the effort behind a curtain, thats why its easy to critizise. but its superficial and shortsighted.

What you are suggesting is big blocks. When theres no use the blocks are not big. Look at bcash
Also, its totally fine to hit a limit. If blocks were able to grow as big as possible bitcoin would easily be bloated to 100 TB and there goes decentralization. EOS is less than a year old and in trouble with their chainsize. Bitcoin is ten years old and no problem.
Bitcoin is doing super.

Your computer breaks —&gt; get a new one. Harddrive breaks —&gt; get a new one and download the blockchain again. Store backup in 3 places to cover yourself from usb stick failure.
Theft dont matter since it is encrypted and nobody can access your bitcoin even if they get the wallet file.
Your own stupidity can be decreased by learning. Use this method to insignificant amount first. Learn how to backup. Lose the file. Get access again through your backup files. Make a transfer using your decryption password. It will become easy but only after time invested. Nobody says this is easier than letting the money rot in a bank account.
If you die, its over

I would not compare Tesla and Bitcoin.
Tesla will eventually bust. They are just the only ones willing to operate without doing profit, not gonna last. You are not gonna want to own a Tesla stock longterm. Not meaning you should short it.
Bitcoin on the other hand, substance and hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:57:55
They are having massive problems producing very small amounts of these cars. They promise too much, don't do enough testing, rush to the markets because that's really their only trick. Being the first.
If these Teslas ever hit volume production doesn't really matter in the long run. Meanwhile, the big players (e.g., Porsche) are doing some actual testing, operating a profitable business, simply outplaying Tesla behind the curtains. Remind me in 2019 or 2020 ;)

Its a perfect use case for you then. Download the software and sync your full node. Validate yourself the transaction that points to your address. Encrypt your wallet and make back ups. Go offline and preserve your wealth, no need to trust anybody. In future, sync your node when you need to use these coins. If you have an old laptop and external harddrive, theres no expense in this and you can sleep tight with a total control of your coins.

There is also discussion of smaller blocks, for your info. Also, bitcoin is currently scaling onchain and 2nd layer. Also, long term fees should replace miningreward so we should actually want the blocks to be full.

The only incentive would be a try to destroy bitcoin. And the attacker not only needs to first acquire necessary hardware, also have access to enough electricity and then keep the attack ongoing with serious running costs. And even after all this, bitcoin would not die if the attack doesnt last eternity.
So its never gonna happen

The costs are super high for the attack and there is not a possibility for a big enough short position for it to end up profitable, imo.

Missing the point
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:06:34
Alts are traded with btc, not usd. So when btc goes down in usd, alt traders dump their alts and that makes alt go down in btc which itself is going down in usd. So when you look at alt prices in usd on coinmarketcap for example you ll see alts go down more than btc.
Same behaviour when btc goes up. Alts often go up more.

Average man dont understand what is money, how ots made and who makes it, who benefits from making it &amp; who suffers when others make it. Also not everybody suffer from censorship regarding their nestegg or payments. These people dont see any benefit in bitcoin and think its a scam.
The more you know about the history of money and the current monetary system the more you understand bitcoin and adopt it.
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:26:20
time goes by, more people buy, traders trade but holders hold. bitcoin will always be better money than any fiat, so theres really only one way. lets say its $250k. does everybody sell? some profits of course but it will still remain the soundest money available because fiat &amp; gold supply is not perfectly reliable and definitely not fixed. so at any price - the future looks better for bitcoin, time horizon is only thats unknown. fiat keeps inflating - every price keeps increasing, bitcoin too. actually, only way to fight back would be to stop diluting the money supply. but even in that case, you cant trust it long term. its only about time.
unless of course a horrific error is found that cannot be fixed and stealing bitcoins from any address becomes available in which case it goes to zero.

2. better distribution and therefore adoption. no questions about who benefits from the 'release'. everyone has had the same opportunity from inception. also, this way new money will be introduced to the system even if everybody decides to hodl.

Buffet only invests in producing assets. He doesnt invest in gold either because doesnt want a chunk of value sitting there doing nothing. He rarther buys businesses or land that produces something which can then be reinvested for compound interest.
Also, he is not a tech guy and missed the apple, google, amazon etc train completely. so, dont expect him to understand bitcoin from a technical pov either.
Finally, he was succesful with his investment thesis because of the time he lived in. He made the right choices at that time. We live in a different time right now and many people holding bitcoin has made and will make better returns than buffet.
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:48:34
Asics are the reason bitcoin couldnt be attacked currently even with the world supercomputers. You shouldnt blame a company for developing the best machines for certain task. And we have kinda reached the top of centralization with bitmain being the one and only producer. Would be stupid to change the algo now when they are getting competition. Bitmain might start to lose the edge going forward. But if the algo would be changed, you can be sure bitmain would be the first to develop the best machines and centralization would become worse than it is atm.

if you think spending supports adoption you can justify needless spend/refill to yourself. by needless i mean you buy a beer or coffee with bitcoin just for the sake of it eventhough fiat would be easier.
but maybe you will give the wrong signal by this behaviour. if you manage to get people adapt because of your behaviour, they will maybe also be spenders and use their bitcoin to pointless purchases. instead of hold.
by holding on the other hand, you might also support adoption. people find out you hold, you tell them why you hold. maybe they will become interested and we get new holders, instead of new spenders.
my pov is, i respect the blockspace too much to use it unnecessarily. therefore, i mainly hold. and let's say adoption is slower for some reason (any reason) --&gt; it gives me a chance to accumulate more with lower prices and the developers to make the protocol better.
in any way, the adoption will come because genie is out of the bottle. dont stress too much what you should do, just enjoy the ride. nobody knows how it happens =D

People will use 3rd party solutions when mass adopted. You can be your own bank if you want to and are technically capable but not everybody will or need to. The important thing is that its your choice.

You are wrong.
The thing with bitcoin is, you cant make more of it by fiat. So you need to earn it or already have it.
If you are doing valuable shit, you will earn bitcoin (or earn dollars then buy bitcoin) and be happy. If you are lucky enough to have bitcoin already, you will either continue to be useful and earn &amp; spend. Or only spend your big stash and thus make the distribution ’more fair’ and own less bitcoin as time goes by.
As time goes by, people not doing anything useful will decrease their holdings (how ever big they currently are) and people doing useful stuff will increase their wealth.
This is the beauty of sound money.

Short answer is that it is voluntary. Bitcoin doesnt use a shitload of elec, people use a shitload for bitcoin, voluntarily. Just like the other people who voluntarily use theirs for tvs, hairdryers and other important shit.

No. If everyone holding bitcoin last november sold when 6000 it would not fall to 100 but change hands to the people on the sidelines.
You are assuming holders are the buyers.
