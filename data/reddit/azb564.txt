I had imagined how Bitcoin could use the new smart cards as a swiping payment device
  
They have display and num keyboard so we don't have to trust the merchant, even without smartphone. 
I had read the software it runs can be customized, but I don't have time to find the source.
We'd put our money in 2-of-2 multisig outputs, with 2 keys we own: the key on home server + key on the card (with back-up)
We could pay in 2 swipes even on compromised merchant computers, like this:  
First swipe loads transaction in the card and displays amount on screen  
It asks for PIN, it's hashed, then the card signs it along the transaction  
The 2nd swipe sends it all to home IP/dns, stored in the card  
Home server signs the transaction if the PIN's hash is valid and not bruteforced  
Then it's sent back to the merchant, or he just waits for propagation
If the home computer is hacked, the coins can't move without the key on the card signing. 
And if the card is stolen we can disable the signing on home PC, and transfer the funds with the back-up
The problems seem: designing the software, whether it can handle it, whether we can put the key on the card by ourselves with some magnetic swipe writer, and whether they can be ordered without being Mastercard
The benefit is that it'd be safer and simpler, and the merchant doesn't have to change habits or his set-up for Bitcoin, just install software for the magnetic reader

For what it's worth, I'm convinced. I don't understand the algorithm, but I like the base idea of allowing miners to be real nodes by removing the economical advantage of delegating transaction details to the pool operator
