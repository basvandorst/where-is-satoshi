There is an old saying that I learned from 'old people'...
'If you can't beat em, join em.'
Well, it appears that they can be beat.

Speaking personally...
	
The 'system' has not worked for me the same way crypto has.  It took me only a few months to amass the same funds in my crypto portfolio that took me over 5 years to amass in my 401(k), and I consistently invest between 6-10% into my 401(k). The 'system' taught me to expect and appreciate small gains (I recall a time a client of mine was ecstatic over the company stock climbing 3%) .  The 'system' taught me to expect these gains to take a long time.  The 'system' will not allow me to touch that money for a long time.   That being said, my preference is crypto.  Much larger gains, much quicker, and fully controlled by me.  You misinterpreted my comment if you think my aim was 'old people'.  My aim is the old 'system' put in place by 'old people.'  It doesn’t work for me anymore, so I am taking my money elsewhere.
	
You say you don't understand what aspect has 'been beaten'.  But, I say what aspect hasn't been beaten?

Used my BoA credit card on coinbase. I got an email from Coinbase saying the transaction was canceled by the bank.  Shortly thereafter I got a call from BoA Fraud department.  They called to confirm it was me.  I confirmed and they 'released' the card.  I was able to use it successfully after that.

There is no lack of understanding.
Exactly what generation are you referring to?  I know several people, younger and older, who were fed up with the trivial gains from there 401(k), divested, and reinvested in crypto.  They are worth (conservatively) 10x what they were worth before, and in less than one year.  Keep your compounding interest and 7% return.

I agree.  But that is my point. 7% YOY is nonsensical today.  The crypto market has provided people with hundreds and thousands of percent gains.  My take is just...why put your money in a market that can hit 7% YOY, if you can now put it into a market that is growing by the billions every day and easily see hundreds of percent gains in far less time?

What's even funnier is all these journals giving Facebook credit for BTC growth this week.
