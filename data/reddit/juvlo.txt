I think the better analogy is, Burger King gets bought out by an even bigger company, and they want to change the recipes.  So some of the original founders quit and launch Burger Pope, selling the original recipes plus some new items. Meanwhile the "real" Burger King is now selling processed soy burgers instead of beef, because it's "healthier".
Bring on the downvotes!

That's not "live".  Having a couple "test" businesses in no way demonstrates that a properly decentralized network graph will emerge dynamically from the population of Bitcoin users, or that the routing algorithm will successfully keep fees to a minimum on a global network.

Running the majority of non-mining nodes wouldn't allow you to change anything; only miners can add blocks.  Running a non-mining node is only useful if you like to play blockchain watchdog, or if you are a merchant trying to protect yourself from a double-spend on a 0-conf transaction.  All you can do with one is reject blocks that are invalid, but that only affects you and whomever you transact with.

Sure, because LTC was faster and cheaper.  Not by much, though; Dogecoin is faster and cheaper than both, but neither stood to gain appreciable marketshare as long as Bitcoin was fast *enough* and cheap *enough*.

I don't see businesses lining up to offer Bitcoin Red, Bitcoin Plus, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, or Bitcore payment options.  Why wouldn't Bitcoin Cash face the same fate in a world where Bitcoin was still fast, cheap, and reliable?

I am talking hypotheticals here.  BCH's relevance is entirely due to BTC's shortcomings.  Imagine a world without those shortcomings ever having existed.  Is BCH still relevant there?

LN is a hypothetical solution that has zero evidence behind it.  I'm sorry, but I don't understand why we should thumb our noses at a proven short-term solution while waiting for what may or may not be a better long-term solution.  That is faith-based policy, not evidence-based. 
Meanwhile miners are getting millions of dollars a day just in transaction fees, which are coming out of the wallets of users. Why is the current situation better than doubling the blocksize (or more)?  Lots of people literally cannot move their money, because a handful of developers are only willing to except a "perfect" scaling solution and not ANYTHING else.  Did all Bitcoin users assent to this scaling perfectionism?

See comments above; the 54% figure is incorrect.

How do you figure?  The mainnet is VASTLY more complicated.  The evidence here is about equivalent to pharmaceutical trials done on a few cells in a petri dish.  LN is about **scaling**.  It needs to prove it successfully **scales**.  That can't be proven on a tiny testnet with no real-world use.

Blocksize is just a proxy for transaction volume.  The weight of the blockchain is a function of transaction volume, not blocksize directly.  The BCH blockchain is currently about 20 gigs lighter than the BTC blockchain.  Is it bandwidth or storage capacity you're worried about?

Do you think the BCH fork would have *any* relevance at all if BTC was as fast and cheap as it used to be?

It's the main narrative against BCH, that big blocks will lead to centralization.  By suggesting such has already taken place, even dishonestly, it lends credence to the narrative (as most won't fact-check).  Almost as bad as BCH supporters spreading misinformation about the potential issues with Lightning Network, except in their case it's usually just genuine misunderstanding.  Lopp is too smart for this to have been an honest mistake, which is unfortunate.  He's usually more level-headed than that.
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:27:00
I bought some t-shirts online with BCH.  Was faster and easier than buying with credit card, tbh.  I was actually impressed.  Hopefully LN enables this kind of ease with BTC; I sincerely doubt it will, but I'd be happy to be surprised.  Whatever can supplant fiat the fastest is good in my book.

@_date: 2017-12-22 02:45:27
You keep missing my point.  If Bitcoin had, say, raised the blocksize so that a fee market never developed for blockspace, it would be as fast and cheap as BCH, and BCH would have no advantages to claim.  Litecoin is a more radical departure from Bitcoin than is Bitcoin Cash--changing the block time and the supply limit and the hash function were all significant changes.  Devs were trying to get Bitcoin to raise the blocksize limit for YEARS before the BCH fork.  If any one of those BIPs had been merged, there'd be no BCH.  And if a scaling proposal that worked without a block size increase had been completed instead, same difference.  Bitcoin's high fees and slow conf times are now a marketing attack vector for competitors.  Because BTC's capacity sucks, now every shitcoin out there is focusing on scalability.  This would not be the case if Bitcoin had adopted any scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:32:13
Explain how BCH incentivizes miner centralization.  It's an old chestnut that never made economic sense to me, maybe you've got a fresh take on it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:49:16
You missed my point.  BCH would never BE established as an alternative if BTC had addressed its own issues in a timely manner.  Assume BTC had done so; imagine a reality where Lightning and SegWit rolled out simultaneously and were adopted within a week.  Why wouldn't BCH have just died?
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:01:05
Some of the claims of censorship are exaggerated, and I'll admit I posted my comment partly to see what would happen.  That being said, I'm surprised the OP didn't get censored, as it's a post about BCH.  I suspect it survived because it's a negative comparison with BTC.  Do you suppose a post positively comparing BCH to BTC would survive here?

A source would be greatly appreciated!  I'm still new to this but you're the first person I've seen to attest with certainty that the routing problem is solved...including Core devs like Jameson Lopp.

Blocksize has no relationship whatsoever to difficulty (which is what demands processing power).  Neither bandwidth nor storage capacity are likely to be a problem, even with full 32mb blocks (which we're a loooong way from needing), and by the time we need gigablocks, we'll have figured out a good implementation for either sharding or zero-knowledge proofs of validity, or else we can implement node incentivization like so many other cryptos (Dash, ZCoin, ZenCash, etc.). There's also Graphene, subchains, block compression...  And if none of those are ready for deployment by then?  Well, then we can talk layer 2.  But denying basic block size increases NOW, when we are nowhere near blocksize causing difficulties, causing users to spend millions of dollars PER DAY on transaction fees (which just go to miners, and still leave tens of thousands of transactions stuck in the mempool) for an indefinite amount of time...how does that seem like the best course of action?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:10:11
Spoiler alert: fewer than half the Hangzhou nodes are running Bitcoin ABC. Lopp is mistaken, if not lying. With around 1247 Bitcoin ABC nodes in existence, only if all Hangzhou nodes were running ABC would his statement be true. If anyone wants to count, my rough estimate is maaaaybe 23% of ABC nodes are on the Alibaba servers.  And ABC isn’t the only BCH client; search “Node_cash” to see all BCH nodes.
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:49:31
I appreciate your civility.  Let me try to explain my point one more time. If transaction volume was due primarily to selling off, that would crash the price, as the supply would inflate in the face of low demand.  Since the price did not crash during the period of large transaction volume, but rather pumped to ATH and then corrected to a higher support level, that indicates that the initial surge was a surge of buying (raising the price), which--just like with most coins in December--triggered a ton of people to sell the top, dropping the price back down to a "reasonable" support level that was nevertheless higher than in previous months.
From this data, there is nothing to support the hypothesis that the volume was due in majority to people dumping unwanted Bitcoin Cash.  In fact the data heavily contradicts this.  Comparing BCH's performance to other cryptocurrencies over the same time period indicates that the post-ATH sell-off was consistent with overall market performance.  
While it is known to be the case that dumps of BCH have occurred, due to exchanges allowing their users to claim and then trade their forked coins, if this was the main driver of volume, the price would have crashed significantly.
If you still disagree, I encourage you to suggest an alternate means to test your hypothesis.  If it cannot be falsified or supported by data, then it's just an empty rhetorical device.

Yeah...an inflationary joke coin with zero development activity and the same mining algorithm as Litecoin, with much lower difficulty, and fees that are [not significantly cheaper than Bitcoin Cash](  Why's it going to win, exactly?
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:24:01
Considering the higher transaction volume correlated with a higher coin price, I'd say "very little".
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:45:14
The fees are so close to those of Bitcoin Cash that the difference is irrelevant.  Neither are "zero fee".  Dogecoin is not instant, it's just weaker--block time is a function of difficulty against hash rate.  One confirmation in Dogecoin is not equal (from a security perspective) to one confirmation in Bitcoin Cash or even Litecoin, it's MUCH less. It's only in the last month that Dogecoin has overtaken Bitcoin Cash in terms of [total value being transacted]( during the winter there was MUCH more value being transacted in BCH.  You Core shills are always spouting off about how transaction count is immaterial anyway, so I'm not even sure why you're bringing that metric up here.
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:38:22
Logic requires premises, and leads to conclusions.  Have you tried actually working through your reasoning? I imagine it starts something like this:
* A. BCH has about 12% of BTC's marketcap
* B. Marketcap is a good indicator of market demand for a coin
* Conclusion from A &amp; B: the population that wants BCH is about 12% of the size of the population that wants BTC. 
* C. Everyone who had BTC on Aug 1st got BCH
* 1st Conclusion from A, B, and C: only 12% of the people who initially received BCH wanted it
* 2nd Conclusion from A, B, and C: 88% of the people who initially received BCH didn't want it.
* D. Not everyone who didn't want BCH could sell it immediately, due to their coins being on exchanges and the exchanges not opening trading on BCH
* E. The population of users on any given exchange can be assumed to be representative of the general population of BTC holders
* Conclusion from A-E: as soon as an exchange releases the owed BCH to its users, 88% of it will be sold immediately
* F. The population of people who didn't hold BTC at the time of the fork, but who actually want BCH, is less than or equal to the population of people who held BTC at the time of the fork and wanted BCH.
* Conclusion from A-F: peak BCH trading volume will occur when exchanges credit their users for the fork and enable trading.
* G. When more people want to sell a coin than to buy it, the price goes down.
* 1st Conclusion from A-G: peaks of volume for BCH will be mostly selling transactions
* 2nd Conclusion from A-G: peaks of volume for BCH will correlate with exchanges opening trading on it, and will be accompanied by price drops.
So, does reality agree with that conclusion?  Why don't you take a look at the numbers for yourself.  If it doesn't agree, that means at least one premise is false. I'll let you try to reason out which one it would most likely be.
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:23:00
Look at the charts for yourself.  If people were dumping it, we would have seen a price drop at the same time as we saw a jump in transaction volume and transaction value.  We didn't; there was a big sell-off at the ATH, predictably, but otherwise the price remained relatively strong (until the whole crypto market started to tank in January).  It was a similar pattern to Bitcoin and other top-10 coins. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:04:22
You are living in a totally different reality than I am, it would seem.  In my reality, it's the BTC supporters that jump on literally every bit of positive news about BCH to crow "BCASH BTRASH BCRASH Roger Ver Faketoshi Jihad Wu".  In my reality, it's BTC supporters who attacked and slandered every dev who pushed for bigger blocks, to the point where a few of them (who were key figures in the early days of Bitcoin) left the community entirely.  In my reality, small blockers DDoS'ed XT nodes, fought tooth and nail against Bitcoin Unlimited and Classic and even a basic compromised increase to 2mb blocks.  In my reality, it's BTC supporters who constantly resort to insults, trolling, censorship, and blocking to drown out or silence anyone who disagrees with them.  In my reality, it was BTC supporters who, when fees got high, tried to rewrite history and claim that Bitcoin was always meant to be digital gold/"a store of value", and not p2p electronic cash to serve as a means of exchange for fast, cheap, uncensorable and permissionless payments.
Also in my reality, it's BCH supporters who are bringing back merchants that gave up on Bitcoin when the fees were outrageous last year.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who have developed a means of using SMS to send and receive Bitcoin (Cash), without smartphones or even internet, so that people in poor parts of the world can be their own banks.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who are working to fix and re-enable features in Bitcoin to restore its original potential.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who are sticking to simple, safe, PROVEN approaches to scaling in the short term instead of pushing unproven half-finished "unicorn" solutions that risk user funds.  In my reality, it's BCH supporters who bring evidence, reasoning, and good faith to discussions about scaling issues, even though they are repeatedly trolled and shouted down for not falling in line behind Core.  In my reality, most of the people who were the fiercest and most prominent proponents of Bitcoin in its early days (when it was uncool, unsafe, and worth very little) have moved to supporting BCH.
When a project forks, be it soft, hard, or both, the whole idea of "the original" goes out the window.  There is no longer an "original" Bitcoin; there's Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Segwit (soon to be Bitcoin Lightning, as far as I can tell).  Both are Bitcoin. It's not hijacking or deceit to treat Bitcoin Cash like Bitcoin.  Our point of view is just as valid as yours, and there is no authority who can say differently.  And for the record, we DO "educate the public", that is the majority of what  does on twitter--it explains the difference between BTC and BCH and extolls the benefits of BCH while pointing out issues with BTC that the BTC community blithely ignores.
Right now it's ONLY the Bitcoin Cash community that acknowledges both sides of the split as valid; visit bitcoin.com and you'll find information on both coins, focused on their shared history. On any site run by a BTC proponent, you won't find Bitcoin Cash mentioned AT ALL, unless it's as "BCash", and it's referred to as a scam.  The Bitcoin Cash community doesn't make it personal; we don't look for dirty laundry in Adam Back's personal history, or Greg Maxwell's, or Peter Todd's, or Nick Szabo's.  Hell, most of us even applaud Elizabeth Stark and her team for their work on Lightning Network!  So I'm not sure what kind of warped reality you live in where BCH supporters look like the bad guys, but it has no connection to the world I live in.

It doesn't take a central entity to organize a smear campaign, just an organized group pushing for a certain agenda.  
I wasn't the one who made the McDonald's analogy; I agree, it's open-source and decentralized, no one owns the Bitcoin name, no one gets to define for anyone else what is or isn't Bitcoin.  If I think Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, that's up to me. If I want to tell everyone that I think that, it doesn't make me a liar. It means I have different criteria for deciding what the "real" Bitcoin is than you do, and unless you WANT centralized corporate control of Bitcoin, you should be fine that people don't share your views on what Bitcoin is or is not.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:39:06
Yeah, no.  A better analogy would be: a bunch of McDonald's managers notice a variety of inefficiencies are starting to become problematic for their business. They notify corporate and request a policy change to eliminate those inefficiencies.  Corporate basically tells them to go fuck themselves.  So they rip up their franchise agreements, form their own company, and re-brand their restaurants.  They re-launch with the inefficiencies fixed, so they can provide better service and prices to their customers, while still offering essentially the same products.  They keep their locations and the basic decor with a similar brand feel, because they want to keep as much of the business that they've been building for years as they can. 
Noticing their success, McDonald's utilizes its superior financial resources to organize a smear campaign against the new competitors, rather than incorporating the ideas their competitors suggested and are now using to their advantage.  They make all kinds of unfounded accusations, organize boycotts of any businesses that support their competitors, and launch a big marketing push for a new product that they hope will bring back some of the old customers (even though most customers just want the basic items they've come to enjoy and expect).  
All of this could have been avoided if McDonald's corporate had just listened to the concerned managers and adopted their suggestions, but nooooooo..."changing corporate policy is too hard, it's just not worth the time and effort!"  Yet now they are wasting MUCH more time and effort (and money) trying to compete with people who were once star employees.
