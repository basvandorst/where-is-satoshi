I’m using my dad’s account :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:32:12
Yay thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:58:58
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:04:53
Hi, I'm using Coincap.io for the data. Not CoinMarketCap (that's what you meant by CMC, right?)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:09:44
Yesssss! Poloniex is supported. 
And yes, you can add holdings in your portfolio. 
The app is $0.99 but that’s one time payment and all future updates will be free. 
Link if you’re interested: 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:45:36
My friend sent me the link. And my immediate reaction was "Lol, someone is being salty."
But good job on the app! :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:54:42
Will get you an android version in a few weeks!!
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:07:20
There is no harm. It’s a tracker, alerts, and portfolio management app. So no risks :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:13:14
Thank you! For now, only organise portfolio, set price alerts, and track. 
But in future updates, I plan on introducing buy and sell too. Will have to look into the legal aspects of doing so 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:18:46
not yet. But i'm adding it!
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:37:32
Also, if you're interested in making apps, you should check out my mentor, Carla White's free class. She's helped me a lot :) I'm grateful to have her   
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:07:01
Also, one major advantage for using mobile apps for tracking crypto prices is that it's faster and more accurate data. 
Plus, in my app, you can set price alerts: Time based alerts to get price notifications every day/week/month at a specific time. Threshold based alerts to get notifications when the prices of a coin pass a certain threshold or drop below or reduce/increase by a certain percent. 
I hope people will find all these features useful :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:30:26
Yes! I will. Btw, if you buy the app now, you'll get all future updates for free.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:56:10
No GRLC, sorry :P 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:02:15
I'll do for sure in the next update! 
Btw, if you download the app now, you get all future updates free. :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:46:18
That's on my list! The app will convert the prices to crypto and support cryptos for every feature! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:28:53
Yes! I love Treehouse. The instructor, Pasan is awesome. And they also have code challenges and quizzes that really get you the practice on things you learn.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:45:11
That’s how old I am. Not my name :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:05:10
I just checked. Coinlib is a website. Crypto Price Tracker (my app) is a mobile app :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:21:14
No, it does not. 
But it’s meant to encourage other teenagers :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:17:30
I will make one for android too! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:20:13
Thank you!
I want to be a programmer, though :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:01:46
I'll bookmark this thread! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:12:20
Thank you! I will surely do! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:58:00
Hehe. How old are you now? Never too late to learn and build great things :) 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:41:45
Yes! I've been squealing with joy! :D
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:41:50
You can find me on the Internet. I'm Harshita Arora. Certain websites like Quora require age verification. I'm on Quora 
And also on Medium 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:56:31
Here's the link to the app for everyone! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:11:09
Crypto Price Tracker. Download is here 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:03:20
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:31:37
Will do for sure :)

I started learning  iOS app development few months back and this is my first app!
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:42:35
Hi! 
I’m adding the automatic integration with coinbase and binance to sync portfolios for v1.1! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:25:33
Hi! The code is not public yet. But here's the link to the app: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:00:14
Haha thanks 
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:45:01
Only for iOS for now, sorry. 
But coming soon on android.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:27:55
I hope you'll feel better soon :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:35:41
Hehe yeah. Statistically, more boys are into programming and app development. So I guess that’s why most people here used “he” 
And my name isn’t very obviously female, either. 
But it’s all good because people recognise me for my work, and not because I’m a “female/woman tech entrepreneur” :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:19:57
There's no harm in using the app...
It's tracker, portfolio management, and alerts app. I do not store any of your data besides just the alerts in the database since I need them to send you notifications when the price condition is met or when it's time that you set. :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:14:03
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:02:47
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:52:29
Thank you so much!! I hope you like using the app :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:10:24
I’ll fix that in the update for sure. I’ve noted it. Thank you for reporting! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:11:03
I’ve mentioned in a different comment that my goal is to inspire other young people to learn to program and build apps and tech products. So if my story can inspire other teens out there, I’d be very happy to create that impact :) 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:27:42
Oh but changing the name mid-launch might cause confusion now :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:02:39
That's next on my list! Currently, conversions and tracking is only possible in fiat. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:31:08
thank you! Would appreciate if you could share it with your friends! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:40:16
Hi! Here's the link 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:16:36
I checked CoinCap. 
My app: 
-&gt; Is localised in 10 languages 
-&gt; Supports iPhone X
-&gt; Has a wishlist feature to save favorite cryptos or the same coin from various exchanges for monitoring prices differences for arbitrage 
-&gt; Though this is subjective, my app has a much more user friendly and beautiful interface :) 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:20:16
i'm not sure what you mean by that. you can read detailed documentation about my experience coding and designing this app here 
And I turned 16 on 2nd October 2017. Show me one post where I claim to be 16 before that. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:48:38
I wrote networking code that requests data from APIs (CoinCap and cryptowatch) and displays it in my app. :) 
Once you learn the basics, you can build pretty much anything!
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:51:50
Thank you so much! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:12:45
Maybe my story inspires you to not give up this time :) 
I’m here if you need help :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:31:51
Sure. You should check out Udacity and udemy to learn to code and make apps and you’ll learn lots in no time :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:08:28
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:07:35
Thank you so much!!! I appreciate it :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:03:01
Buy and sell is not there yet. But, I’m looking into the legalities related to that to develop that in my app! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:33:19
Dogecoin is in the app! Just search for it in the search bar :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:32:05
Not yet. But planning to build one sooon because so many people have asked! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:35:35
Thank you! 
20 comment karma for what? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:47:01
Haha I download a LOT of apps! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:57:20
Alright, I’ll do! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:10:16
Yes!! I’m coding the Apple Watch complications for this! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:26:57
Core here refers to? 
I used Core Data and Core Animation frameworks :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:33:48
I saw three 5 star reviews from people who mentioned they came from Reddit. I got teary-eyed reading them. It was completely unexpected. And I'm so glad people loved my app! 
Thank y'all for the support! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:20:31
So do you :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:56:48
I’m a girl :) 
But I’m happy to be called dude :D 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:15:43
Thank you so much for the feedback! 
I changed from 1 to 2 decimal digits after a tester asked so. I’ll do 3 now, as you say! 
I’ll add that information too. 
Keep using the app and share more feedback! I appreciate it a lot :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 23:27:54
I used swift 4.0
For graphs, I used the cocoapod “Charts”
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:55:15
Sure! Check out udemy. They have excellent courses (free and paid both). 
Check out Udacity (free and paid nanodegrees). 
Check out treehouse (free trial) 
These are my top favorite ones!
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:59:52
I used Swift 4.0 
Frameworks: multiple! Core Data, Core Animation, and many more. And a lot more cocoapods like Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, and Charts. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:08:03
It’s called Crypto Price Tracker and you can download it here: 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:51:15
The app doesn't have any ads. No subscription fee. It's just $0.99 one time payment and you get all future updates for free. That's less than a buck. :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:11:24
Hello! You can download my app (which is on iOS!).
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:55:13
Thank you so much! It's Crypto Price Tracker. Link is here: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:16:48
thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:35:52
Meaning? :) 
I’m Harshita and I’m an entrepreneur...so :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:05:28
Thank you so much! Any feedback on the app? :) 
Leave a 5 star review if you like the app! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:23:19
Hello, 
Here is the link to download Crypto Price Tracker: 
I forgot to put the link in the original post and now I think I can't edit it. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:12:24
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:20:36
There’s a blue button that reads “$0.99” and you can download the app by purchasing it there 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:29:15
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:56:08
Hi! Thank you sooo much for the detailed feedback!! 
1. The second tab on the app is wishlist where you can add your favorite cryptos. The main interface (tab  takes 2.5 seconds to load every time user opens the app. But wishlist takes 0.1-0.3 seconds to load all the cryptos. 
I’m setting up a caching server with a friend and will rewrite all the networking code to be able to display prices faster! Now that you’ve bought the app, you’ll get all updates for free :) 
2. Alright! As you say! Coming in v1.1 for you! :D
3. I can’t fix the center wheel because my tableview’s cells’ length is custom and the wheel is in iOS and it’s in the horizontal middle of the screen. If I make my cells the same (crypto name and price), some cryptocurrencies like bitcoin when converted to a fiat like INR won’t fit in. I’ll research on how I can make my custom Center wheel. 
4. Will fix everything! 
5. 1. Alright, will do. 
5.2 I’m not sure if I understand. Logically the condition you set is being met. You mentioned &lt;12,000$ for BTC. So if the price is below that, it’ll send a notification. However, the cooldown period is 6 hours. So you won’t receive another notification for that alert (I did this because otherwise it can be annoying). 
If you’re interested in getting a notification when the price drops below 11,500$, then you should set 11,500$ in the text box. 
Did I address each of the points in your feedback? I really appreciate the time you took out to extensively test the app and write feedback for me! :D 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:58:49
Yay!! Good luck! Message me if you need any help! :D 
Happy to help wherever I can :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:00:14
Crypto Price Tracker.

@_date: 2018-01-28 23:59:20
Ah, yes. I’m Indian :) and also Sikh :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:59:51
I learnt from Treehouse and a course on Udemy. But now, I mostly learn concepts from Apple's documentation. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:02:45
Just wanting to encourage other young people to make apps and tech products too :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:00:52
Alright great feedback! I’ve noted it down! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:00:23
I will surely do. I’ve been getting that a lot!
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:46:19
Thank you! :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:16:10
Coming in the v1.1 in a few days! 
You’ll get future updates for free if you’ve downloaded the app :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:01:19
yep, the app is localized in Japanese! And also Korean, Chinese, Russian, Turkish, Portguese, German, French, and Spanish!
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:40:27
Yes, I’ve made the app myself. 
The app is currently $0.99 on the App Store. But if you buy now, all future updates are free. 
Yes, it’s safe. There is no confidential data being stored :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:24:36
thank you so much!! :D 
Would appreciate feedback! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:26:30
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:49:48
You can do that in the app :)
Switch exchanges in the left column and switch currencies in the right :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:09:56
I can’t thank you enough for all the kind words! :D
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:39:21
Thank you so much!!!
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:09:43
No problem. I can understand :) 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:17:12
You’re so kind!! Thank you! :D
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:31:33
XCode 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:09:23
I learnt from online courses on treehouse and udemy. And then lots and lots of practice! 
I also attended a summer program at MIT called LaunchX where I met a lot of other teenagers who are great programmers! Being in good company and network helps a lot! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:46:23
the app :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:24:20
Thank you! Here's the link! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:28:59
I'm going to reply to the top comment to share the link to the app since lots of people have been asking. 
And please don't hesitate to email me at harshita 
I'm honestly very overwhelmed by the response! I had never been this active on Reddit because I felt "unwelcomed". But my best friend encouraged me to share the app here :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:10:03
Oh, that’s because new apps don’t have high ranking when they launch. I’m hoping my app’s ranking improves. 
And thank you for the download! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:25:30
Thank you for the advice! I appreciate it! 
What specifically do you think I could have done better? :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:47:13
Thank you! I’m 16 :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:41:21
You should definitely learn to code! It’s a great and valuable skill to have! :D
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:46:14
thank you so much!
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:11:12
Haha what do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:32:44
I will yes! I’m already coding that. Widget and automatic integration with exchanges for portfolio coming in v1.1! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:10:49
And it’s already on iPad! Any iPhone or iPad or iPod touch with iOS 10.0 or above can download the app. 
iPhone X is also supported. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:34:35
Uhm...what makes you believe I’m not 16? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:54:23
You can find me on the Internet. I'm Harshita Arora. :) 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:34:06
It's Crypto Price Tracker. Link here 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:50:25
Hi! I’m using CoinCap and cryptowatch :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:25:19
Did you set more than 1 Bitcoin price alerts? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:58:14
Awww thank you so much! 
Any Feedback? :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:58:52
Crypto Price Tracker. Download it here 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:11:56
I’ll do that!
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:04:56
I learnt to code from online courses on udemy and treehouse. 
And then lots and lots of practice!
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:09:13
Yes! Swift 4 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:46:03
Can I post the same thing in multiple subreddits? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:40:59
I started programming only around 2016 :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:48:47
:P 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:01:21
I will surely do! I noted your feedback :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:15:36
Different set of coins for tracking or for portfolio? 
For tracking, yes you can create a wishlist 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:00:56
It’s there. You can search in the search bar :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:57:41
The app currently displays prices with 2 decimal digits. So it rounds up to the nearest number. So it’s $0.10 in the app 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:06:50
Okay! I’ll add a 6 month and all-time graph! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:06:27
Thanks! Appreciate it a ton! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:08:43
Hello! The app is here 
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:58:22
Hehe no. The API I’m using (CoinCap) doesn’t have GRLC :( 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:52:38
Yesss! You can do that manually in the portfolio tab (tab  in the app). You just need to enter the amount of crypto and the buying price! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:36:01
You can download here 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:01:00
Awwww thank you :) 
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:52:06
Thanks a lot!! I hope you like the app :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:36:28
It's Crypto Price Tracker. You can download here   :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:27:57
Thank you! I’m improving as I code everyday! 
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:48:49
I’m doing that for binance and coinbase! 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:11:38
Thank you! 
I learnt from my teacher at school when I was 13. :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:54:12
Awww thank you! Much appreciated! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:17:23
It’s Crypto Price Tracker and the link is 
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:37:33
Alright. Noted. And I'll add it on v1.2 perhaps :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:37:07
This is strange. You should only be getting the alert once (the &lt;11 k one). I'll into it. :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:36:21
Totally! Black and gold gradient look awesome :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:06:03
There’s no encryption in the app. All the data (your wishlist, portfolio, etc) is stored locally on your phone and only alerts are stored in my database which I need so that my server sends the notification whenever the Price condition the user specified is met or whenever it’s time :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:37:51
Crypto price tracker :) 
Link is here 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:18:20
Thanks! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:15:08
I'm not sure what you mean by that comment. 
The app has multiple features that coinmarketcap.com or any other app currently doesn't have. 
It has price alerts. Time-based (get a price notification everyday) and threshold based (get a price notification when the prices drop/go up/etc) 
It has portfolio management. 
It is fully localized in 10 languages. 
It's a mobile app VS a website. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:19:03
Alright sure! I'll look into it.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:03:40
Oops sorry. My data source doesn’t have GRLC :(
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:21:33
No, I'm trying to inspire others. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:26:37
Uhm not sure what you mean by that. Lots of people have messaged me telling that they find the app useful. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:29:51
Thank you for the feedback! I'll fix the stuff you mentioned!
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:11:18
Sure, I’ll code them for you! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:04:42
No, not yet, sorry. :(
But you can download this app here: 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:31:07
Thank you! I was surprised at that too! It’s only been like 12 hours since launch! It’s crazy :D

Thank you! You’re very kind :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:46:41
I'm coding the widget right now; will hopefully release an update in a few days! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:11:59
Hi! My app sends the notifications with the default sound. But I can add the SOS-like alarm sound if you’re being serious. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:59:37
Crypto price tracker. 
Crypto Price Tracker. Download it here 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:24:46
Thank you so much! 
I wonder how you know so much about me :P
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:38:19
Will surely build one soon!
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:19:57
Erm..it's not a commercial. 
But my app's name is Crypto Price Tracker and the link to download is here 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:48:31
Haha! I have mentors. But I appreciate your offer :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:09:32
No plans yet. :( I do not know Android app dev, but I can learn! :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:43:38
I didn't say "allows trade". I said "helps trade"
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:02:24
you can check out the video here: 
I hope that helps :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:01:56
Thank you so much! I will surely ;)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:08:07
It’s not too hard if you’re determined and have mentors to help when you’re stuck. 
I’m grateful to have 2 really iOS app developers as mentors who I can ping whenever I get stuck :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:24:02
In what sense? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:09:28
The app should be in the French App Store. Is it not? 
In fact, I localised the app in French (amongst 8 other languages!)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:01:10
Thank you so much! :)
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:47:28
No, 32 fiat currencies! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:31:52
to inspire other young people to build apps and tech products.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:59:57
Thank you so much! I’ll DM you :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:42:52
Awww thank you! ;)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:35:58
They have rate limits :( 
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:20:51
And btw, I have not worked for a dev company. I worked for 2 months in my bedroom with nearly zero budget. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:03:55
I am, yes. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:57:02
Hey this is my first app! I worked on an app before but that was with a team. And my contribution to the app’s development was little :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:19:10
Yes! That’s because now it’s in the top charts :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:50:04
Crypto price tracker.
You can find the app here 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:32:33
Uhm no, thanks! :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:07:42
It’s called Crypto Price Tracker and you can download it here: 
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:30:04
Not yet. :(
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:00:27
Haha sorry no GRLC :(
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:34:36
It’s a cryptocurrency price tracker, alerts, and portfolio management app. :) 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:10:17
I’m not sure where should I mention the link? 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:04:24
I wasn’t sure where I could share the name and the link...still not sure :P 
Have to individually reply to each comment. Is there a better and more efficient way?
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:55:54
I appreciate your comment a lot. Thank you so much! I’m hoping to improve a lot as a programmer and a designer in the coming years :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:19:13
It supports Dogecoin. But not Garlicoin, sorry 
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:55:42
Crypto price tracker! Link: 
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:00:58
Also, for those of you who'd like to make apps, I shared my story and the lessons I learned here 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:28:33
For sure! :D Thank you!
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:38:50
Hi. Nice to meet you :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:38:50
Nope, no ads! And no subscription fees either. 
The app is $0.99 on the App Store. But that's a one-time payment and you get all future updates for free. :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:08:36
Thank you! I love design! :)
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:37:47
Yes! I will. Wait, are you Milan? :)
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:13:42
Thank you! 
Do you mean buy and sell? Yes, I’m looking into the legalities of how do to that and I’ll develop for my app!
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:35:07
Hehe thanks, the developer name is my Dad’s. I’m &lt;18 so I can’t sign up for the Developer membership. My name is Harshita Arora :) 
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:29:46
I made networking calls to cryptowatch and CoinCap APIs using Alamofire. My code pings the API every 6 seconds for the latest prices :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:31:59
Thank you! I’ll code the sum of all the holdings. 
The 24 hour change is there, however. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:53:18
Would anyone here be interested in an app that you can directly download from the App Store on your Mac that lets you see the prices on the touch bar? 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:52:41
Anything you wish was better about the app?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:51:32
And how is this relevant here? Are you saying I used my "attractiveness" to manipulate two good coders to make my app and take credit for their work? 
Because that's the only reason you'd mention "cute girl". And you're clearly being sexist in there. Anyone can use you, if you let them. Regardless of their gender or their "cuteness".
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:44:24
There isn't a clear A) or B) because it was both, depending on what feature it was. 
I can give an example for both situations. 
I was trying to understand Core Data to create models for the Wishlist and Portfolio feature. I googled and started reading Apple documentation. 3-4 hours later, I still don't have any clue how I can create models to save data in the user's phone. I ping Bhavish (other mentor) who then explains me everything I need to know for exact feature I need. He spends 75 mins explaining me on a whiteboard everything and showing me examples. Usually, Core Data can take days to understand because there's many applications and aspects of it. If you'd like to have a look, go here 
Now, the mentor was very experienced and he knew exactly what I was trying to achieve so he knew WHAT to teach. Without him and Aviral, I would have never learned on my own just from googling, Apple documentation and StackOverflow because there are not enough context-specific answers. 
An example of the situation B). Sometimes, especially I was very stuck with the cocoapod Charts to create the price graphs, Aviral did write code for it. And I learnt. He is credited for it in my Facebook posts, on my Quora, in my Medium articles as a valuable mentor. I never said anywhere "I'm the sole creator of this application where I got 0 help from anyone. Preach me, I'm a child prodigy.". 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:43:11
I’m adding binance to the exchanges and updating the app soon
@_date: 2018-02-01 00:40:21
sure! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:32:12
No, your situation is different because the person copied your code only altering names and such. 
The help I've gotten from my mentors (and I've extensively written about it on Quora here   is more like: "I'm stuck at this, I don't know how to build this feature. What library or framework would I use?" 
And the mentor who replied to my message earlier and had time would then send me links. If I still didn't understand, I'd ask them for time on a video call. Where they'd explain me things. I'd then write code, test it, and commit to the repo. And then they'd review it and suggest better practices and such.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:11:53
Well, everyone knows it's volatile. 
Not everyone fully knows the reasons and understands them. Do you?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:17:32
Wow really. This seems like it has become a full-time job for Vivek and other trollers who love gossiping. I'm going to take a minute to type this response. I'm tired of reporting everywhere for harassment. And I'm clearly going to have to take some action to stop this. And before anyone here mentions, "Stop being a crybaby, grow up. No one is harassing you, you liar." I've been getting extremely rude and vulgar messages on reddit, twitter, and even on my Facebook posts in public groups. 
So first of all, everyone who worked has been given credit. I wrote a Quora answer on 22nd January clearly mentioning I paid $200 to my friend Harsh to build the backend. And recently, I paid him to build the caching server. Here's the link: 
He was not mentioned as a maker on Product Hunt, because he was not interested and didn't want to get notifications and be disturbed. 
Coming to the iOS part, let me say this again, I coded everything on my own (with the help from 2 mentors), along with designing and marketing. I have previously given the explanation for why the git log shows 19 commits from me and 79 commits from my mentor, Aviral. If you understand version control, even if you alter a string, you can make a commit and that'd be commits +=1. 
And that's all I have to say for now. I don't care what others think. I never created an environment where I falsely took 100% of the credit for everything to get media attention for being a child prodigy. My articles have gotten 0 media. No news or tech publication has reached out to me. Most attention is from Medium posts that  I wrote for educational purposes (I'll admit they also promoted my app). Because let me say this: IT FUCKING DOESN'T MATTER. Stop behaving like trolls. You're some of the most immature people I'm giving any shits to. Go get a job and stop bullying and harassing a 16 year old on the Internet. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:34:01
And you didn't have to mention "girl" and especially not "cute girl". Just saying fellow student would have worked. I don't know your exact intentions behind mentioning it but it's redundant to do so.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:03:52
I didn't (and still don't) have GitHub subscription for private repos. And since I don't go to school, I'm not eligble for Github student pack. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:10:46
It's called Crypto Price Tracker, you can download it here: 
Thanks :)
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:31:43
Haha. It’s possible that there was some bug in firebase (where my server is hosted). But it should work perfectly! :D 
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:45:18
Hmm that is very strange. The alerts should come on time. The server stores alerts in UTC and sends them at the exact time you set them at in your time zone. 
Do you mind trying out alerts again for me? Maybe trying setting another alert for 5 mins from now or something :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:46:22
You care for the wrong reasons. I have made little money from it (not even crossed 1000 downloads). 
You're nothing more than jealous of a kid who has done things you could have never done.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:49:48
Have you made apps? give me the link. I'll see your code prowess. 
Have you started a startup and made it big? Tell me about it. 
The only reason you're here wasting your time harassing others is because you're jealous. Let me say again, you're FUCKING JEALOUS OF ME and everyone else who seems to hurt your ego for your own incompetence and inability to do anything meaningful in life and get praise from people.
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:24:07
Nope, I was looking to inspire other people. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:01:13
Thank you. The author, Vivek, was my friend and briefly a mentor back in September 2017 when I was learning. I stopped talking to him because he has zero experience with iOS apps. And now he's pissed for whatever reasons.
Most people here are not being logical. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:05:20
In other words,
