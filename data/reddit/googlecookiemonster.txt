Damn it. Was gonna sell at 12.8k but now dropping to 12.4k and going.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:33:58
uh oh.
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:10:47
Damn it. Another lesson learned: use DCA! I used all my funds at 11.2k even though I told myself "just buy a fraction in case it continues to dip."
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:55:27
Good idea
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:20:46
I'm glad I've finally become immune to price drops. Only took a year and a couple months. I want to say I am now a true hodler.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:07:16
I'd sell if I wasn't in the red lol.
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:45:03
Break out the chickens for some santeria so we can bring the price back up.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:13:48
Thanks. I'll go hang myself now.
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:32:32
Buy when above 10k, sell when under. Make dem gainz son.
@_date: 2019-07-05 20:09:08
Payday today so maybe lol idk.
@_date: 2019-07-13 20:19:41
The time to buy is now!
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:10:15
any particular reits?
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:33:34
Not sure if to buy in right now or wait for further drop.
@_date: 2019-11-17 07:59:52
Bitcoin sale coming.
@_date: 2019-11-14 10:36:19
Yes please. Black, like my hope.
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:40:02
@_date: 2019-11-27 19:28:31
Very good question. I am wondering too.
@_date: 2019-11-22 09:51:22
Just bought the dip! Feeling bretty gud.
@_date: 2019-11-14 08:01:31
Time to break it again. In the other direction.
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:31:49
Hello! :)
@_date: 2019-11-19 20:42:59
Oh man, thanks for the laughs.
@_date: 2019-08-03 09:19:05
Damn, that big jump to 10.9k.
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:24:57
Think I will buy now.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:19:24
I was on the road just now. Saw it at 12k. Said I'll sell it when I get home. Got some breakfast, washed my hands and as soon as I sit down and logged in, BOOM. Dump. Perfectly calculated.
@_date: 2019-08-06 16:46:42
Bogged! But can you buy more so I can buy the dip?
@_date: 2019-08-06 14:16:30
@_date: 2019-08-07 20:59:41
@_date: 2019-08-01 20:02:57
Very tough choice right now: sell now and rebuy when it hits under 10k again like it has been these past few days or maybe hodl because this time it may be different?
@_date: 2019-08-15 05:54:03
I told myself: sell at 11.4k. I still was in the green. I said nah. Lost all dem gainz and now in the red again. I'm hodl gang again
@_date: 2019-08-05 01:51:44
That feel when I sold at 10.4 in anticipation of a drop :(
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:46:18
Swing high, sweet satoshi, coming for to carry me to the moon
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:00:58
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:23:57
Dahmp it!
@_date: 2019-08-13 14:13:38
You will feel much happier after hitting that buy button.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:46:03
Just bought a minute ago. Now bitcoin price is $50 less. Youre welcome :)
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:50:10
Sold at 8.5k for a loss of 3.2k. Saw it go to 10.2k where I didnt have access to my bitcoin. And it just happened on the day I decided to accept my losses. I think I will go buy a S&amp;W now.
@_date: 2019-08-08 18:18:29
Temporary bottom, reversal.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:41:43
I bought back in. Knowing my luck, the price will now start going down.
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:44:12
I don't wanna get bogged anymore.
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:30:13
Same. We got bogged.
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:20:18
I was getting excited when it was nearing $4k
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:37:04
My lost gain is now 5k. I think I will now shoot myself.
@_date: 2019-10-26 09:01:52
I sold. Mystery solved.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:23:51
Wasnt it crazy when we were prepping vegeta memes for $9k? Now we're panicking when it's touching $10.5k
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:08:29
Shutup old man and give me my lambo
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:14:07
At this point, I would prefer some cyanide.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:48:07
Sigh... So I just lost approximately $1,700 in profit for selling near $9k. Don't make my mistake! Now I need to wait until the price reaches $9360 in order to get the original amount of bitcoin I had :(
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:13:13
You can predict the next jump if you use the bofa method.
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:47:19
Same, I sold exactly when the price gave me enough to keep my initial input after the coinbase thief fees. And now I am kicking myself in the ass because it's not doing what it did the first time in late 2018, which was dive straight to 6k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:13:07
Way ahead of you. I got out of the red and sold early. Now I bought back in at 13.8k (fomo) and because I am mentally handicapped.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:31:22
Except there's a tiny factor: luck and fate hate me! They conspire against me. I can hear them, plotting...
But maybe youre right. I will but unfortunately I withdrew my cash balance in coinbase which is gonna take a week before I can use it. A week for a lot to happen. 
Plus for some reason, I can't setup an account with the Cash App, I have a looping error where it makes me confirm the same info OVER AND OVER so I gave up.
@_date: 2019-10-26 19:49:35
A smith and wesson lol
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:10:32
Buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:56:47
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:43:09
Can't tell if sarcastic or serious.
@_date: 2019-06-09 07:36:29
All quiet on the crypto front.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:04:48
I see that it is around 11.2k but I guess touching means it stays on that price?
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:18:42
I'm sorry. I'm just anxious with my balance. Laughing will keep me from crying.
@_date: 2019-06-20 20:42:55
Buy, you fools!
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:27:51
So what would be today's equivalent of throwing myself off a building?
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:27:24
Bitcoin checker lol.
@_date: 2019-06-02 10:11:00
So who is waiting for $9k to sell?
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:55:26
 [
@_date: 2019-06-09 07:47:15
Ja, das bit!
@_date: 2019-12-19 20:08:12
Uhh sure let me just consult future me, i.e., my imagination:
It'll go to 7300 and then plunge to 6500. Either way, someone always wins with any bitcoin price!
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:10:58
Ok, not making the same mistake twice. Buying half now and half later in case it drops more.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:05:20
Watch this: I'm buying back in ( sold low buying high now cuz  and as soon as I do, the price will drop DRAMATICALLY like it did on me the first time. Gonna hit the buy in about 10 minutes and watch it drop within a few minutes or hours.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:21:01
Awesome. Bought at 13839 and like I expected, it went down. Laugh it up lady luck!
@_date: 2019-06-13 07:15:41
oh boy! we got em:
BOFA THESE NUTS!
