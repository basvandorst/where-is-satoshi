Bad advice "directly exchange them at a trading platform like Yacuna in EUR or GBP and get the money transferred to your bank account". Why not trying to pay some suppliers in BTC ? Exchange them in FIAT will create again fees for you and also more demand for that FIAT. I think if you already accept BTC you should go further and convince your suppliers and employees to accept BTC like a payment.

In very basic terms:
- first check if you have fever
- if you have, drink some cold water and relax
- then go to bitcoin.org and read all documentation.
You will find out that Bitcoin network is based on internet communication.

I'm not saying that. I said that is better to pay for something its YOURS (like bitcoins :)) and nobody will touch it.
A personal server doesn't cost so much that nobody can't afford it. Buying a domain for your own cost around 9$/yr, then the rest is just fun. And it's yours forever. If you are smart you can put a real firewall too and see who really wants to read your emails trying to get in. After you will realize how much it cost YOUR privacy keeping your emails in hands of gmail/Hotmail/etc "cloud services".

Never store private stuff on "cloud" storage even if they will encrypt the data and the transfer.
Use private NAS like QNAP. A simple NAS at home or in a very safe place with internet connection  will give you more security then ever.
All cloud storage locations are not YOURS and in any time NSA/GOV will seize your data. Is worthless to be encrypted if you can't recover it.

Ebola is a fake fearmongering tool. Don't fall into this trap. Just think a bit and answer this question: do you see ANY picture of infected person bleeding out all of their body (because this is ebola)? The answer will NO. Because there is no picture or video in the entire internet with this symptom. Just some people in plastic bags or walking around in a hospital. That is not a prove that ebola exist. All you see on media is just a fake a joke for sheeple to make you to take the vaccine shot with OTHER intentions but curing ebola. Awake and think twice!

What you see on news about "Ebola crisis" is not an ebola. Is just another "crisis" created by govs to scare you and take the shots. Is a fake virus that doesn't have any of the symptoms of ebola. Also to make you to donate to fictitious funds. Keep your coins, you will need later. Or just buy some vitamins to strength your body. One question do you see ANY of the infected persons with the body full of blood ? The answer is NO. Because they don't have any symptoms of ebola. Think again....

But the thing is that not all "bitcoiners" are living in a IRS spying country like US.
And also the question is how IRS will know how much btc I have received into my wallet from commercial trades/incomes and how much in total.

@_date: 2014-09-25 21:00:22
Yeah is worthless. Better insist on your company that you work for or your clients to pay you in BTC or at least a part of your income to be in BTC. Then you will see that each one of other merchants will adopt without any other "push". Ask your boss to pay your salary in BTC or your clients if they can pay the invoice in btc. That will be much better adoption...

Yeah in Spain the adoption is quite small but also people are quite dumb and not very well educated (in terms they don't read any other news than Spanish... ). I manage also some other servers with IP from spain so I will try in future to pot a full node on some. I keep the BTC/NMC node on my personal home server because it's mine.
But once the Spanish users will understand the importance of keeping a node they will do it. And yes once is synced, the bandwidth used is not too much.

"How does Bitcoin fit in? Suppose I wanted to buy shoes at Overstock that cost $100. If I pay by credit card, the receipt says $100, but my card’s rebate means I actually only pay $97.80. If I wanted to pay with Bitcoin instead, I’d need to open a Bitcoin wallet and pay $101 to Coinbase to get $100 of Bitcoins (at the current exchange rate). (The extra dollar covers a 1% fee to Coinbase.) If I hurry straight to Overstock, my Bitcoins should still be worth $100. (They’re as likely to go up as down in the time I have to wait.) But notice: The transaction ends up costing me $101 by Bitcoin, versus $97.80 by credit card."
WRONG! 
- The 1% fee of coinbase is on BTC worth 100$ not on 100$!
- didn't put the commission of the bank charging with credit card that sometimes goes to more than 3%!!!
- and finally, the bank that gave you 100$ on your CC is double spending those bucks!

I never let the  data folder of bitcoin-qt to stay on appData/Roamin folder.
On Windows, the whole %appdata%\Bitcoin directory can be replaced with a symbolic directory link: Make sure the bitcoin client is not running.
Move the %appdata%\Bitcoin directory to its target location (e.g. d:\bitcoinData)
Run the command prompt as root and issue the command
mklink /d "c:\users\&lt;your_user_name_here&gt;\appdata\roaming\bitcoin" "d:\bitcoinData"
In this way also you can have same location of data folder for 2 computers in same lan or keep safe that location out of you local drive that can be infected/deleted.
Developers should take in consideration to make something when you install the BTC-QT to let you choose that location. From now on that location should have at least 20GB space and more and more...

Why make it so complicated instead of just putting on a usb drive encrypted and then just delete the wallet.dat from your online computer. There are several guides how to do it also on a booting Linux usb drive with the wallet already. To send btc to that address you don't need to open that wallet for every transaction, only when you want to send coins from that wallet and /or syncing time to time the database. Simple and safe.

For many users is hard to understand what is a HDD and backup in a separate location. Users usually they save only what they have on their desktop (usually links) and not the real data, in special with bitcoin data folder.
Maybe future wallets will be more user friendly and ask them where to store the data folder, including suggesting them to use a remote/network/external storage/backup.
And yes right now is quite simple to save your coins: File - backup wallet.dat. Or just copy that file on a secured USB drive.

Romania have now fast and cheap internet because after yr 2000 they didn't adopt the ADSL type of connection, they jumped directly to install fiber optics.  
First people start to make local networks between neighbors, blocks, streets, just to play together. Then the big companies just came and stick the fiber optic into their lans. Later those lans became all fiber optics. Then the competition between companies started and now they fight to offer the fastest connections for less price.
