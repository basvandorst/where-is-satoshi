Californian here, bought 10BTC on the 15th, they took the cash out of my bank account yesterday, should have got my coins at 7 last night, but still waiting on it. I think they're just overwhelmed by increased demand, and hopefully they'll fix their problems soon.
@_date: 2013-05-20 21:40:29
You could auction it on Bitmit instead.

Yeah, no coin here yet either. I emailed them yesterday but no response yet.
Edit 5/10: I got paid!
@_date: 2013-05-14 03:23:05
Coinbase has ~1% fees.
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:43:46
It's called blockchain.info, not currentmtgoxexchangerate.info.

I'm mining litecoin with cudaminer (which doubles nvidia card's hash rate) and then selling it for bitcoin on btc-e.
@_date: 2013-03-25 23:19:15
I'm tempted to not share because you'll end up snatching up coins and making it harder for me to get some, but whatever. Smaller orders go through easier. The other day my 5 BTC order wouldn't work, but I was able to put in two 1 BTC and a 3 BTC order all in a row.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:57:09

No Paypal involved.
@_date: 2013-05-10 05:48:45
When exactly did they receive your phone and when did you get paid? I've been waiting well over a week now.
Edit 5/10: I got paid!
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:12:14
Just wait a week/month/year
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:32:44
Sell stuff on bitmit
@_date: 2013-05-11 01:17:08
I'm considering buying some and then auctioning them off individually. Maybe just make enough so I can pay for one to keep for myself. But yeah, it's not the best choice for serious mining.

@_date: 2013-05-06 19:17:37
All I can think of is using bitspend to preorder through whatever website.
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:18:50
Whoa, that is one sexy looking app. I'm excited for the push notification update!
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:39:11
Feel free to release it on Cydia, though.
@_date: 2013-05-05 19:30:23
Contact bitmit support? They've helped me out in the past.
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:43:40
I got mine today!
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:52:46
Wow, it was weird going in there and seeing posts I upvoted long ago. Thanks for the link.

Had to split my 10 BTC order into 5/2/2/1 but I'm still happy.
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:46:30
Holy fuck that must be amazing.
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:14:00
So is it mail delivery? Is that even legal? I guess cartridges aren't really that detectable but still. I might give them a try. I've been thinking about getting a gpen and this would be a great reason. Though I wish my local delivery service took BTC.

I don't see a Bitcoin button on the [page]( Will it not be until the next bundle?
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:57:24
I keep both apps on my phone in case one craps out.

Once BTC price hits $20,000 I'll be good to go.
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:41:45
You send them pictures of your doctor's rec and your ID when you sign up.
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:34:31
This is incredibly fucked. They could have just sent the coin to one of the charities accepting BTC.

Coinbase will deposit money to your bank account for a 1% + 15 cent fee, though it takes several days.

I did this with Smartwatch+ from Cydia on my jailbroken iPhone.
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:53:49
My iPhone is jailbroken on iOS 6.1.2 and there's a completely functional blockchain.info app on Cydia.

I was skeptical that my cats would use a hammock, but after seeing all those kitties, I ordered one to give it a shot.

They kinda do own this subreddit though.
