Central Bankers Explore Response to Bitcoin: Their Own Digital Cash
Transformation could cut costs while raising security concerns
By RYAN TRACY

The rise of bitcoin has central bankers around the world studying the possibility of issuing virtual money backed by the government itself.
A shift in that direction could cut costs across the payment system and give authorities more control over their money supply. It also could​raise security and privacy concerns.
To date, no central banks have embraced issuing digital versions of their fiat currencies. But the prospect is gaining steam as officials around the world begin to view a mostly digital payment system as inevitable.
“We have to envision a world in which people mostly use e-money,” Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in a Nov. 13 speech. “We need to anticipate this and manage the risks and benefits that could arise.”
So far, central banks haven’t settled on a technology that would allow them to issue their own digital cash. But a Dublin-based startup, eCurrency Mint, has been meeting with central banks and marketing a technology that it claims would give them that capacity.
Jonathan Dharmapalan, founder and chief executive of eCM, said the firm has discussed the technology with 30 central banks, piloted it “in multiple countries,” and reached agreements with two central banks to transfer to them the technology necessary to issue the currency. He declined to say which central banks or countries but said he expects them to announce the programs publicly soon.
He said that, unlike bitcoin, his technology isn’t designed to operate as its own payment system outside the existing one. Instead, it could be transferred just like cash between consumers, merchants, banks and payment companies, using existing digital transaction systems or new ones. In other words, it would change the makeup of the currency without changing the “pipes” through which it flows.
In recent years, Canada and Ecuador have experimented with their own digital payment technologies, and the topic is on the research agendas of central banks across the world. The Bank for International Settlements, the members of which include 60 global central banks, said in a paper last month that existing digital currencies such as bitcoin raise the possibility authorities will have less control over the monetary system—and “one option is to consider using the technology itself to issue digital currencies.”
Officials at the U.S. Federal Reserve say they are monitoring developments but haven’t said they are considering issuing digital currency.
Central bankers’ interest in digital currency is an inevitable reaction to the rapid shift away from physical cash. The existing payment system is electronic, but money is stored centrally in bank accounts and verified via payment networks, which add cost along the way.
A digital currency, on the other hand, would be like a bit of encrypted computer code “minted” by a central bank. It would carry with it all the necessary information to validate its value. That means in a sense it could move around with users and merchants.
​For instance, today a consumer might hold $10 of digital cash on a debit or gift card issued by a bank or a retailer. That $10 can only be spent where the card is accepted. But if that card held $10 in digital currency backed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, its owner could, in theory, spend it anywhere.
The prospect is appealing to central bankers for a litany of reasons. On a practical level, they could save money on printing physical cash. Mr. Dharmapalan says minting and distributing digital currency would cost 10% of what it costs to print and distribute an equivalent physical currency note while allowing the government to retain the revenue it gets from issuing currency, known as seigniorage.
Central bankers also might find appealing the ability to better track transactions, since cash transactions are anonymous and susceptible to illicit uses.
In a news release Wednesday, the Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm backed by eBay Inc. founder Pierre Omidyar, said it had invested in eCM. The company and the investment firm, which haven’t previously spoken to the media about their digital currency project, wouldn’t say how much money eCM has raised since it was founded in 2011.
Felix Martin, an investment fund manager and author of the book “Money: The Unauthorised Biography,” said he hasn’t evaluated eCM’s technology in detail, but in theory such an innovation “could be a very useful technological advance, most likely as something to sit alongside physical cash” that would allow nonbank firms to interact digitally with the central bank.
Kennedy Komba, who works at Tanzania’s central bank and with the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, a global network of financial policy makers, said he had met with eCM, and that he thinks the prospect of central bank-backed digital cash has “a lot of potential.”
In Africa, for instance, where mobile-phone payments have grown rapidly, physical money backed by the government is still crucial, says Mr. Komba. If a mobile-phone customer in Tanzania wants to put money in her account, he or she often must deposit cash. If that same consumer wanted to make a payment to another person who didn’t have the same phone company, he or she would have to withdraw cash.
To facilitate all that cash movement, the central bank, commercial banks and phone companies must spend money on employees, vaults and secure transportation. A digital currency could reduce those costs by making transactions simpler and easier to execute, and that could lower the cost of financial services more generally.
In developed countries such as the U.S., digital cash could also have benefits for consumers by allowing money to move more easily and cheaply in the digital realm.
Economists such as Andrew Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, have said widespread use of digital cash could create new possibilities in interest-rate policy at a time when existing monetary policy tools are being pushed to their limits to boost the global economy.
Policy makers have generally avoided negative interest rates, in part because consumers would withdraw their physical cash from banks if they felt the negative rate would diminish their account value. If there were no physical cash, account holders wouldn’t have that option.
“Perhaps central bank money is ripe for its own great technological leap forward,” Mr. Haldane said in a Sept. 18 speech.

They wouldn't have any impact on Satoshi's coins, they would have an impact on Wright's coins.  Wright lost access to his btc and knew Kleiman had some.  So he contacts Computer Forensics LLC, and they (or Wright himself) contact Kleiman's father claiming they are both Satoshi to give Wright access to Kleiman's btc.
Satoshi's coins don't come into this at this point.  Wright has no coins, the late Kleiman (who may or may not be Satoshi) has some coins, Wright *claims* he and Kleiman are both Satoshi, so he can claim ownership over some or all of Kleiman's coins.

In February 2014:
MtGox suspends all trading.  Wright loses access to any btc he has there.  Btc withdrawals are suspended on the 7th.
Wright contacts Computer Forensics LLC (in which Kleiman was also a partner) claiming he and Kleiman were Satoshi, and asks them to check hard drives for any wallet.dat files.  Gizmodo article doesn't mention the exact date, just that it was in February 2014.
Louis Kleiman (who was 91 or 92 at the time) posts a question on the 12th, possibly to the first bitcoin article he finds on Google, asking about his late sons involvement in the development of Bitcoin.

Bittylocious is great.  You don't need to verify until you buy £1000's worth.  Their support is really awesome as well.  I had a buy when the price was going up Nov 2013, and the guy didn't send it.  Support honoured the original price (think it was $100 more by that point).

People will support BIP101 because there's no consensus.  Discussions get closed down and pros and cons are split into a pro community and a con community.  Bitcoin has brought together a lot of people who agree that a currency shouldn't be controlled by any one group, then split into pieces because a group controls what is and what is not ok to talk about.  People are moving over to xt and classic not because it's better, but because it's closer to the ideas that got them involved in btc in the first place.
If you want a strong bitcoin, listen to the users.  Don't decide what you should listen to, or how it should be.  If the community is unhappy with something, that won't go away by just deciding what's best for them.

As the reddit user that posted that, I totally agree.  At another time there'd hopefully be some info in their bitcointalk thread.  Keeping an eye on their [blog]( for any updates, but it doesn't get used often.
