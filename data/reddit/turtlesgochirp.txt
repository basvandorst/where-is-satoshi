This, it is theorized the US government can never default on debt because they can always just print money.  Good for the rich who hold a much higher wealth % in assets and not currency.  Also wages take a long time to catch up to hyperinflation.  Once the interest rates start to rise it's going to get messy real fast, probably what will trigger the next recession.
40 years ago a mortgage was 13% interest, now it's 4%.  A loan at 8% is almost twice the current mortgage rate.

"will" means in the future, not now.
Merchants pay out the nose to credit card companies and would love 1 cent transactions.

So because banks didn't invent smartphones they aren't innovating?
When I can send them a picture of a check and deposit it?
There has been a lot of innovation and efficiency improvements in banking because of it.

It's not deflationary because the value is increasing, it's considered deflationary because there will only ever be 21 million and here and there some are lost making the number go down.  I think they are wrong and when we hit the cap we will fork to have a constant inflation because that is better for the world.

That would be retarded.  Businesses and people need banks for loans and storing currency safely.  It is a big advantage a modern economy has over the past and you would have to be a complete idiot to think we don't need them.

It also means when you say it is deflationary, you are wrong.

Most people on the planet can't participate in VISA transactions, for them that number is 0.

The only reason people are using alt coins is a temporary bottleneck making transactions expensive for BTC.  Once BTC solves these problems, and they have the biggest and best dev team on BTC, alt coins are going to tank.  Only a dozen or so will be worth anything, things like NEM, DOGE, LTC, ETH.
The BTC ledger is the best one and can be forked to any other method of conducting the transactions (as long as private keys don't change).

This is true.
Because banks don't serve most of the world.
Half the world has internet but no good banking options.
They don't stand a chance because they don't want to serve those people they aren't profitable.  So they don't care either.

That may be common, but it is wrong.

Not everybody can.  You need only have 1 person in your family born with a disability and they cannot immigrate to Europe or Canada.  They will reject you because the disability is expensive to treat.

Technically yes, but you would need large volumes and old crypto (bought a while ago) to have a problem.
It's hard to nail down a price point on crypto or even exactly when the transaction occurred in crypto-crypto.
If I buy BTC and 2 month later swap it to LTC and it was worth 20% more I am supposed to file the gain.  Luckily ignorance is a valid excuse in tax law, as a new law is written almost daily.  Compound that with the IRS being underfunded and I wouldn't bother reporting it if I were you.  Complete waste of time.

You can also use an old laptop, put the software wallet on that and never connect it to a network again.  Make an encrypted file container and put a backup in it on a flash drive and cd.
