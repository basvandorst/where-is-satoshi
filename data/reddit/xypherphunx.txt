Well spoken. Thank you.

In europe they are doubling down catching money laundring transactions. They will know your crypto holdings. Opt out.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:27:41
I would cancel my bank account as soon as I can live of of btc. Payment wise that is.
@_date: 2019-08-05 11:20:05
If you are using bitcoin for its designed purpose it should not be too difficult to figure out. Decentralisation. It's movement is bigger than only the currency, although it will be the main drive. I would urge you to read up on Julian Assange for example. And his views on the mass surveillance state. If that doesn't get you started nothing will. Cypherpunks unite!

Spot on. More people need to open their eyes.

I personally use Web services or atms to aquire btc. From there you can do much. Enjin, bitfinex or abra.
@_date: 2019-08-08 21:58:59
But a lot of bullshit institutions will still try to dube the public. Think about gold notes for instance. You see this happening already. People need to be educated. It's a problem. I see hope however.

Please stop using Facebook.

One satoshi vs one dollar. Now that would be more interesting.

I do not understand the down votes. People be sheep. Bitcoin is only for lions.

How do you flip a bitcoin? Wasabi?

Epoxy and put in a frame. Would buy.

I hear everyone about electrum.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:59:03
Me? No. The world? Maybe. Time will tell.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:20:12
Well it's our right to put them out of business.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:50:04
Well to be honest with you. That's because people here understand the important fundamentals on self sovereignty, monetary policy and sensorship resistance.
Although there are a lot of clowns. The foundation of btc is laid by educated individuals.
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:52:50

Yes. Indeed. Although not everyone is as happy with Andreas and his political views these days. But, he is very technically capable and is still spreading the word.
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:39:10
You are making a very valid point. I just want the future now.. ; )
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:14:00
I think people will choose there money. Unless the bank joins in on this. They are out of luck.
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:52:08
I think this is:
A. Making very sure the transaction goes through.
B. Being generous to support the system in which you have wealth.
Both very good options if you ask me.
@_date: 2019-09-02 22:14:19
I guess that he takes a stance on politics. The beauty about code is that (besides from its creator) its unbiased. That's what crypto is about. For everyone. Not about the opinions on top of that. It's above the law! Cypherpunks unite!

No. I mean: You decide for next x amount of time the price will be y amount of sats. X having an interval bigger than the volatility of the market, monthly for instance. Also it being an option and not the sole payment method. This means people have a choice. If you believe in btc, you could discount your customers if they pay this way. Because btc is more valuable than fiat, hence its inflation model.
@_date: 2019-09-01 14:21:19
Some will survive. My shills: btc. Eth. Iota. No real need for more. But if you want some sprinkles. Enjin.
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:06:31
I'll tell you. Currency manipulation is much older than '71. Currently reading on the French nation bank around 1720. Peculiar.
@_date: 2019-09-07 16:32:48
954.231,33 ( the only questions that remains is. In what currency).
@_date: 2019-09-02 12:39:30
I can't wait!
@_date: 2019-09-06 11:10:47
I hope we all stay healthy enough to see these days. Eat well my friends.
@_date: 2019-09-25 07:52:20
I need more to put in indeed.

@_date: 2019-09-02 17:55:24
That was the idea. Mostly got negative karma on this one. But I'm happy some one sees the light.

Anyone remembers TENX?... XD

@_date: 2019-09-02 18:09:47
This is a good argument. Your money is only safe in btc. This is because its the only secure network. If you want to speculate, sure buy some alt coins. But even then I wouldn't touch bch or bsv with a ten foot pole. I won't shill my other coins here.
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:13:14
Nothing I guess. That's the problem.

The smallest notation ever would be Charlee Lee.
@_date: 2019-09-18 11:51:57
Wtf.. Does this make btc rise in dollar value because of inflation?
