While I feel sorry for those that lost money the best part is there won't be a tax payer bailout.

All you have to do is change legal tender laws so that the dollar is only legal tender for public debts. Let people use whatever they want in a contract.

This type of thing is the future. The same with BitCloud. Instead of a useless proof of work like BitCoin actually do something useful. Instead of bying a ASIC miner you provide a server and get paid for storage and bandwidth. This seems to align the incentives correctly.

I had an issue where I paid but the order was not processed. They had a special Bitcoin help email address and I filed a complaint in Friday. This morning they sent a refund back to a wallet address I have them. I understand there will be issues during a rollout but the way they handled this was great. I'm putting in another order today.

This is exactly why I don't watch the news. On the couple of subjects I consider myself knowledgeable on they always screw it up. So why would I turn to them to learn anything?

Maybe he should worry more about implementing his process. I still have .09 BTC in limbo. I checked out and paid them. They claim they never had the order. Fun!

Somebody set up us the Ghash
All your bitcoin are belong to us.

That's what I'm using my Jalepeno for.

So is the idea to replace miners with servers and routers? You get paid for transmitting data? Or is it just getting paid in Bitcoin?
