I'll admit I'm one of those bitchy people, but my issues have not been resolved. I bought bitcoins at their original prices weeks ago. I've sent countless e-mails. I still haven't gotten a response. I only get the automated messages. I'd *like* for them to honor the original prices, but I feel like I've run out of hope. As it was back then, I stood to make hundreds of dollars worth of profit. That's not what I want to do, though (although it is nice). I want to SPEND my bitcoins through merchants that accept bitcoins. I want to help out the community as much as possible.
I was planning on giving some of those bitcoins out to some of the Latino parents in my non-profit's educational classes, but as of now I'm bitcoin-less. I wanted to introduce them to this new idea, to spread the growth. Hell, I've already spoken to my non-profit's finance department about incorporating a bitcoin donation button into our website. But when I explain bitcoin and when they ask about my experiences, it would be dishonest of me to avoid talking about the issues I'm facing at the moment.

I know, but I'm just afraid they're going to keep refunding my money.
I bought my coins a week ago. Surely they can honor those sales. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:20:34
Be wary of number 3. You can buy now, but you're at their mercy when receiving it. I've bought bitcoins at lower prices only to have the orders cancelled on the day of the return. They essentially borrowed my money (interest free) for that time.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:40:51
It has been. OP probably isn't aware.
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:04:54
I'm moving away from them. I'm buying from campbx once their banking platform is set up next week. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:28:24
I understand, but what else am I supposed to do? Are there any other suggestions for people who want to buy with their bank accounts in the US?
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:44:55
There do seem to be more snobs, but coinbase is no longer reliable. I've had horrible experiences with them in just the past couple of weeks. I'm no longer using them. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:32:15
Woops! I got you and confused for a second. 
Now we both have something in common! (it's not our cakedays :c)
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:26:02
¡Qué bueno! ¿No saben si van a tener uno en los Estados?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:41:47
Cool beans. Just setup an account. I'm trying to deposit funds, but it's not giving me the option of linking a bank account. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:09:58
I'm not using anything right now. I'm going to use CampBX once its banking platform is set up next week. I've been using coinbase, but now I'm fed up with their bs. Sadly, this is the plight US residents suffer.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:46:23
Yep. Same for me. We'll just have to wait. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:48:14
Don't expect to get a real response from support until next week. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:28:03
Is it trustworthy? Has it been hacked? I'll give it a try if it's safe.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:50:50
Of course. As soon as I've settled these issues, I'll start buying bitcoin through another source. I know they've gotten busy today, but that's no excuse for being late on my transactions from a week ago. 
They just changed the arrival time for my bitcoins, too. I'm not getting them until much later today. Uuughhh...
...And now they cancelled my order. Great.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:58:34
It's not working for me. It hasn't been working for a week. I placed several orders, but they never came through. Thy haven't even refunded my cash yet.
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:55:40
Bwahaha, it is done. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:35:07
I know, right? People just need to open their minds to the future. If what that Starbucks person said comes true, maybe we'll see quicker adoption. All the US needs is one major company to start accepting bitcoins. The rest will be history. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:19:19
I've tried to get white-listed so many times, but each time fails. Teach me your ways. How did you manage to coax them into honoring the sale? How did you even get them to respond to you?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:26:31
How do I do that? I've sent countless e-mails, but no response.
I heard about somebody being able to reverse their cancelled buys, but I'm not very optimistic. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:02:48
Thank you! I guess I just need reassurance.
How does one put in a support ticket? Sorry, I'm too new at this.
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:30:16
Good. I will no longer use coinbase. I suggest all others do the same.
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:29:28
There you go! That would be perfect. 
Happy cakeday, btw. That's an awesome cakeday date.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:30:46
I know. Ugh. There needs to be a competitor who can actually follow through. The person that creates a reliable exchange like that stands to make a lot of money. Perhaps this is something that can be done through Reddit. Reddit could start an exchange and get out of the red. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:32:00
Could you link to a more insightful sight then?
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:17:54
I'm not entirely certain about the situation, but my 5 consecutively cancelled orders within the past month and failure to respond to my e-mails points to incompetence and possible abuse of our money. 
They just need to communicate!
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:52:30
This is exactly why I want bitcoins, but I'm not even allowed to have any because my orders keep getting cancelled. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:08:06
Would that make a difference? Wisconsin, Alabama, California, Maine?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:37:43
¿Entonces este sitio solo es para compras con bitcoin? ¿No es un sitio de intercambio del dinero?
Quiero que todas las grandes compañías acepten a bitcoin. Nos estamos quedando en el pasado. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:39:35
I'm tagging you as not-our-cakeday buddy. What color would you like?
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:37:59
Wait, let me just pay a few extra fees while we're at it. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 13:25:28
I no longer want to use the big players then. What other options do I have, though? Localbitcoins are too expensive and coinbase was the only trustworthy US bitcoin exchange. Where do I get them now?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:23:09
It'll keep doing that. It's been happening since October. If you buy in to take advantage of the situation, it seems they step in and restrict such purchases. I bought  in (well, I tried) at around $300 and $500 before the big increase, but they were both denied. I suggest you not give them your money, since they're essentially borrowing your money interest-free for days at a time. They could easily be reaping the rewards while they have your money in their hands.
Go through another service or try local bitcoins.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:11:24
I'm picturing a few people gathering around someone who owns bitcoins. The people have fiat currencies in their pockets, symbolized by large, heavy objects (anchor, anvil, cinder block, etc). The heavy objects have the signs of current fiat currencies. One item will have the $ sign, another a euro symbol, and so forth. The person in the middle with bitcoins will have a glowing, floating bitcoin symbol above their head, which will signify bitcoin's liberation.
Either that, or we need to find a good mascot for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:11:25
Damn, wish I had seen this. Now all I have is a hangover...
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:17:50
Yep. I was supposed to get one today, too. They already took my money, THEN they cancelled my order. They cancelled my last two orders, actually. Each after huge gains.
