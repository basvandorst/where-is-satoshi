oh ok. i could have sworn it was 4k because i remember lurking the bitcoin sub in september and i made a post or a comment there like "why not just save up the 4k and buy one bitcoin". it sparked a discussion. 
but thank you.

Trying to get my shit together. Im loving all the bitcoin news though, its so interesting.

Yes i know but when i made that post i thought it would be easier to just slooooowly save the money and put it all in at once. But now i realize that makes no sense because you only reap the benefits of an investment like this if you do it the right time. 
I just thought it sounded annoying to continuously buy such small fractions of bc.

Thanks for the details! I am saving up a couple grand to invest into bitcoin. I think its worth the investment and I hope it becomes the main form of currency someday, or at least a much more common option that is accepted as payment in most places.

Who the hell would even be that close to you to see your pin?

I had a similar experience when i was trying to post something online but this was before I even gave a shit about bitcoin. After hours of trying with no success, i just went out and bought a giftcard and used that to complete my purchase. The site accepted gift cards.

What's the logic behind this?
@_date: 2017-09-25 08:09:38
I realize this. I myself am your average person. I just feel like it would be a lot easier.
