No contribution really, just two subs acting like children. Stop the drama.

Sort the words on how they are positioned on the picture, by degree. i wouldn't be surprised if a pattern showed up.

yeah but lots of people also lose money when the price goes up namely the people who buy bitcoin now.
@_date: 2016-06-09 10:28:32
Bitcoin noob here, i mean i've been using it since it was 80€ a pop but, what is a blockchain ID?
@_date: 2016-06-13 18:35:01
you are missing my point, in a healthy economy you have winners and on the other side you have losers. That's the way things are. When people make money other people lose money.
@_date: 2016-06-09 10:40:06
yep, the hype is real i just signed up too. just because of TBL
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:41:10
because greed, that's why.

Maybe wait a little bit and see if the $3000 mark stays stable, before adopting a smaller unit?

oooooh magical LSD !

i have no idea what's going in the Bitcoin world right now...
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:31:55
Honestly, seems very useful and cool. But are you saying that Schnorr Sigs can never be implimented by altcoins who don't have SegWit ?(sorry if this sounds ignorant,i'm not a core dev. i genuinly want to know)
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:56:17
ok i get it, thanks
@_date: 2016-09-29 10:49:41
To me it's just confusing. It seems like there is no consensus amongst the users (me) the miners and the devs. This creates an environment that is very confusing if you are not a l33t coder. And it sucks if you are not up to par with the technical aspect of things. How am i suppose to know who to trust and who not? if  i don't even understand half the things that are beeing talked about. I might be wrong here, but that is how it looks from the outside looking in.

magic mushrooms, don't need very much light, heat however they can't live without. just saying...
@_date: 2016-09-29 11:38:34
you know, i don't care for the drama in the community either, by me stating that i was confused (maybe i could have worded it better, in hindsight) i get downvoted instantly. 
So what you are saying is that i should put all my (blind) trust in core? How do i know that the developers and me are on the same page? Like you said trust is hard. And i just don't give it out like a cheap prostitute, you have to earn that trust. So far we cool,but if the trust is gone at some point ,than so am i. for me it's easy i have nothing invested so there's nothing to lose. I just want to see Bitcoin succeed as Satoshi Nakamoto intended.
have a nice day man
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:28:12
yes, that's true. hence the name trustware
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:37:34
Yet nobody seems to think about using a simple tool like a ladder.
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:17:39
Why should i trust them, they cant even make an operating system that's like secure and decent. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:34:41
Sure, i myself own a xbox360 which i still play on alot. But most average people only come into contact with either windows xp , 7 , 8 and 10. and those are still the worst when it comes to security. all the things you mention maybe valid. but that doesn't take naything away from my point.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:27:02
no. just no. Windows OS is not secure. just google for "exploits windows" and then compare to any other OS you like. Windows will always have a lower score in that regard. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:00:22
ban both subs sitewide , problem solved. Stop the toxic behaviour. How is it helping?
@_date: 2018-07-28 11:18:55
You have my upvote sir
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:20:55
Come on guys it's an obvious troll, are you so easily triggered by this? then they are 'winning' Let them call things however they see fit, it's beyond anyones control anyway, so why stress over it? let's be productive instead shall we?
@_date: 2018-04-01 10:28:58
what do you call them cups, that american athletes use mostly? ah yes jockstrap. i imagine the sound as they smack the stage with a neet sound effect.
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:11:23
yeah i love Audi
@_date: 2016-07-08 14:56:30
oh you do? that's cool, when i told my friends about my car they never heard about it. but yeah cool, mine is the 1.6 turbo-diesel 77KW 105hp it's lighter than my older 1.9 but really good fuel economy
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:15:50
dude i have a bike and i use it alot. but, they stole it last week :(
@_date: 2016-07-21 12:12:27
Thanks to you i get it now. I was also in the dark.
@_date: 2016-07-08 08:26:48
for that amount i rather buy Audi.
@_date: 2017-06-21 05:10:06
Similar story, i saw a friend write a large fb post (around 1000$ / btc) about how Bitcoin is going to become the next standard. Claims he had 'won' sooo much monies, by basically doing nothing but sitting on a bunch of coins. He was making big claims about how smart he is, and how fast he was to adopt this new currency.   He is 'sales' type, doesnt know anything technical. I asked him 1 question wether he had reader up on the current Block size debate. Seemed he couldn care less. we are not friends anymore. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 10:34:14
and you can spend 25k on options in no time, i have the smaller s3 which is unknown car in the States but it's still an Audi.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:43:51
Your story seems very plausible and i have no reason not to believe you, though the guy i mentioned was just lying though his teeth.
