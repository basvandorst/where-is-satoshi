1. Completely decentralized. 
2. There is no board of directors or governing body. 
3. Has the most exposure globally. 
4. Market capitalization

6800 by Thursday. Futures close on that day. They are funneling us now. FUD will be posted twice a day 5am eastern and 11pm eastern. Market cap should fall to 215-230 billion. 
February 19th - 23rd 5k levels will be tested. CBOE futures use the week long average to determine price. Again FUD will continue twice a day. Market cap will test 200-215 billion. 
CoinDesk.com will be used for most of this FUD as the Future exchanges are heavily invested in them. 
My guess is they will use tether and CFTC audit FUD and regulation news along with more “hacking” articles. 
After Friday the 23rd all FUD will lift and they will generate FOMO articles about how the price will be 40k by December. 
Then the process repeats over and over until price is around 1k for BTC. 
Edit I forgot to mention - If you want to make money try and always buy on Thursday night and sell on Saturday by 10 am. 
Just my guess. Good luck out there

Sorry. Just my opinion DYOR. 
The future exchanges are doing to Bitcoin what they did to gold. Look it up and see for your self.
