Proof of cost increasing due to circumstances beyond reason. Proof that it has a worse track record than before it was turned private. 
Considering it's only been private for what, 3 years? Compared to how long it was controlled by government, I think its doing quite well. 
Also, what would you prefer, higher taxes to cover the higher budget costs when the post office makes a loss, or paying a couple of pound more to post a parcel?

He's not the prime minister...

It's not tory, it's basic Economics. Ever heard of monetarism? Instead of running a budget deficit to boost GDP, using careful fiscal policies with careful money control can also boost GDP. Like it has done. So.. Tag me as you want, but the facts are there.

So, do you have evidence to back this up or are you just going to complain and say that's just how it is?

And what does the post office have to do with bit coin..? Your argument is flawed. It's also beneficial to the UK that we sold the post office. Being privately owned it now experiences competition to a higher degree, which is good for prices and availability, compared to before where the company lost money, and the loss has to be funded by the government. That being said, again, nothing to do with bitcoin.

I send packages quite often, so does Amazon, and any company that ships good. It most certainly isn't a dying trade, as third world countries become more developed, posting goods over the world is just going to keep expanding.

I hate the replies, all the people that say stuff like that seem so.. Ignorant and uneducated. He's actually done some good stuff for the British economy since he became Chancellor. For example, recently we finally came out of the recovery phase, while under his austerity plan, which shows we can grow and the government doesn't need to run a large deficit.

One of the replies says, along these lines; pity his father didn't use the withdrawal technique

But bitcoin isn't more desirable.. Cash is. Because cash is money in its most liquid form. Basic stuff.

Inflation is the biggest enemy. So is volatility. Which bitcoins going to have a lot of.

Not to be mean..but if you are studying economics..you really need to revise. The definition of money is that it is a medium of exchange. So by definition, yes bitcoin is money. However you then need to look how liquid it is. How easily can bitcoin be turned into cash. US dollars are already the most liquid form of money, considering they are cash and can be used anywhere. Bitcoins however are not, they can't be used everywhere..which means in some places you'll have to convert them to cash to use them. Hence why the dollar as of this time is better.

In which way is bitcoin better ...?

Then why are you arguing with the gentleman above, he's basically just said what I said with greater detail and the information to back it up. Bitcoin is a cool concept, but until it is accepted everywhere, which could take far too long, it's useless for day to day transactions. At the moment it's just a massive craze because it's new and it works, but there isn't enough evidence to say it will always be the case.
