millimetres and milligrams and millilitres are extremely common among "average people"
millimetres are the little lines found on every ruler, milligrams are on drug packages and prescriptions, millilitres (sometimes called cubic centimetres) are on every commercial can/bottle to indicate their capacity when you buybeverages

I meant it as in: the more the get-rich-fast newbies get burned, the less they want to go on participating in making speculators rich.

But for the same reasons: value density makes it easier to steal, which would increase its value as a target for theft and robbery.
So it's easier to protect all other things equal but also more likely to be stolen all other things equal.
I think the two things just negate each other.

The fact that Bitcoin is already spreading as a payment system (online merchants, ATMs).

Well, not for bitcoin.  
I have always compiled bitcoin-qt directly from source myself.
But in general I wonder what sort of crappy patches might get sneaked into our linux distributions, hidden among the useful/essential ones.

Not true.  
Micrometres (aka "microns") are used by non-scientists as well, e.g. when dealing with electronics, fabrics, hair.  
For example, some hairdressers nowadays use microscope cameras to perform some simple hair analysis. Most people who use centimetres or millimetres in everyday life also know what a micrometre/micron is.


Almost everyone in the world uses the SI and knows m- is milli-  
I think that guy is correct that this is mostly an American problem.

I think you can tell the client to verify all blocks on startup, with a commandline option.
So in theory all you have to do is verify them all just once, then use the default behavior from next time.

I will always use BTC together with metric prefixes: they are unambiguous and come quite natural to most people who use the metric system on a daily basis (i.e. most of the planet).  
Lately, I reason in mBTC (millibitcoin = 0.001 BTC).
I ignored the whole "bit" controversy: as to this day I still have no idea what one "bit" is supposed to be.  
I will probably ignore this XBT controversy as well.

Oh. Uhmm.  
Well, in my experience that's unusual.
So you did not even study micrometres or micrograms or nanometres at school, and never read or heard them mentioned before?
Over here, i can see "micrograms" mentioned in drug packaging (along with the more common grams and milligrams)... and nanometres, for example, are mentioned a lot when you deal with CPU and GPU architectures (e.g. if you have ever built a PC).

I am not saying most people have an "intuition" of what a micron is, since it's hard to picture in everyday life.
I am just saying that, in metric countries:
1. Most people learn the concept of "micro-" (and nano-) well enough at school
2. Most people encounter the concept of "micro-" (and nano-) often enough in real life as not to forget what that concept means
3. Non-scientists exist who deal with micrometres (or micrograms or micro-anything) daily, either because of their job or because of their hobbies

Well, the concept still works if we consider neighborhoods of 0: we could claim that the initial price was as arbitrarily close to 0 as we like.
So BTC has increased over 1000000000000x in its history!

And even if it is about the WWW, it's still a lie: it focuses on the most successful internet protocol while ignoring all the the ultimately unsuccessful (gopher?) or not as explosively successful ones (smtp/email? usenet?).

To be honest, I don't think that's true either.  
I think most of those people jumped on the Bitcoin bandwagon hoping for their value to increase, and not because they genuinely consider spending their Bitcoins.

From what I understood:
The malleability issue simply means that the transaction that ends up being included in the block chain is not guaranteed to have the same txid that got received by the miner who creates the block that includes it.
Or, in other words, a miner can modify the txid of transactions before including them in the block he's working on.
Or, in other other words, do not use the txid of an unconfirmed transaction to track future confirmations for that transaction.

But distro patches are often useful, almost necessary: e.g. to make projects play nice with a distro's filesystem structure, or by backporting some needed feature (or security bug fix) in an old version.

As someone who has studied how the Ethereum protocol works, I have some doubts they have "recreated Ethereum on the Bitcoin blockchain" since some of the key concepts of Ethereum require its own blockchain.
Perhaps (total speculation on my part) they just recreated an Ethereum blockchain built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain? But if it were so, I am not sure what the advantage would be.

I got taught the basic metric units in elementary school (micro-, milli-, centi-, deci-, deca-, hecto-, kilo-, mega-) when learning about the decimal numerical system.
Then again with more rigour (e.g. including nano-, pigo, giga- and tera-) in middle school and then again high school, at the very beginning of science/physics curricula.
That's why I am surprised that you live in a metric country yet you never got taught this.

This is meaningless, mathematically speaking.
Since the starting price is 0, you can always claim that any cryptocoin has increased in price over Nx in its history, for any number N you like.

I am not scared.
I hope this will eventually drive all the day trading _"let's get rich soon!"_ speculators away, and the exchange rates stop being so volatile, and we finally can properly use crypto currencies as a more or less stable form of payment system.

To buy and sell bitcoins at a fast pace.  
So, mostly for trying to speculate on short term market fluctuations.


Absolutely not.  
The beautiful (and most important) thing about Bitcoin is that you are able to send/receive Bitcoins in a peer-to-peer fashion.


To be honest: I have no idea.  
I only buy/sell from/to other people directly. I have never used an exchange (and, given the recent events, most likely never will).

Remember, though, the adjustment is triggered by block number, not by time.
If the hash rate suddenly dropped to 1GH/s for some mysterious reason, the next adjustment might never happen because the block for the next adjustment is never reached.

qBittorrent can do it too, but not as well as Deluge, IMO
qBittorrent is my favourite standalone torrent client, Deluge is my favourite split frontend/backend torrent system.
