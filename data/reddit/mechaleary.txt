Actually, a number of bitcoin atm manufacturers take a percentage of the transactions as an "operator's fee."

Sideloading is a stock feature, so unless you're in a very closed version of android, it should be capable of installing apks. All CM- and AOSP-based ROMs allow sideloading, if you happen to use a custom ROM.

ACH deposits, specifically for bitstamp and similar market-style exchanges.
Also, it would be cool if I could direct deposit my paychecks and have a set portion be exchanged for bitcoin.

I was thinking more about in-person exchange, which would avoid the escrow, and you could discuss with the seller (or buyer) what an appropriate exchange rate would be.
Edit: I also highly recommend CampBX, and I should have mentioned it in my first post.

probably as high as $3500 USD in about 4 years, when block halves, and like $7500 USD when block halves again. At that point it would be too expensive to mine blocks for bitcoins, and instead miners would mine for transaction fees, the price would then be mostly stable.

They have a policy for the recent batch of orders that allows a refund if you've been waiting for your order for at least 6 months, then it's 30-45 days to process the refund, and then 5-7 days for the money to get to your account.

I once lost my 2FA for CampBX, and if you know your password and tell them your last transaction or your balance, then they'll override your 2FA

I've been using [CampBX]( for a while, the ability to deposit and withdraw with only a USPS money order is such an important tool, especially for those of us trying to remain anonymous.
