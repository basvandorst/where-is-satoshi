Dude watch the movie, such a great. The feds were looking to make moves to send him to prison, he could have left and laid low for a bit but decided to stay and roll the dice.

Have you filed for a return on all your taxed income successfully? Tbh that looks like some Illuminati type wives tale, it doesn’t say anything except buy this book and had 5-10 pics of random maybe doctored up checks... idk never heard of it but if these random nobody’s can get all their taxable income back, why haven’t the mega rich seen this and done the same? If it’s too good to be true?...
Edit: decent write up by Forbes: 
Sounds like they try to use clever wordplay and hope for the best. Genuinely curious if you successfully filed and got your money back? Seems like way to big of a risk than the reward. You have to recognize this is some fringe of society bull crap that is just so beyond anything reasonable? If you’re that much against taxes and governments why don’t you move to a society or tribe in the forest where there’s smaller government and less taxes?

just this second sure. but not too long ago the network was backlogged and fees were sky high. get off your high horse... look at his fee chart man. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:23:08
yea thats false man. maybe for a particular period sure. but bitcoin fees were wild for MONTHS. the attack didnt last for 6 months when fees were $2-5 or higher

other than if crypto overthrows the governments of the world and the people hold the power? please enlighten me
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:20:13
this will be mitigated once crypto trading platforms come out where the platform holds the crypto in escrow till both parties agree goods/services have been delivered.

Credit cash advance fee... was that really necessary? Wasted money to not prove a point on this sub...
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:09:24
True, but without someone holding escrow you’ll always have the potential for item scamming. You have to trust someone, either the seller to deliver or the escrow agent to proctor the deal. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:56:50
It’s not that I don’t understand it. It’s just crypto doesn’t inherently fix as many problems as this sub thinks it will. Without an escrow agent (crypto, PayPal, whatever) you will always have a potential for scamming. 
Smart contracts could potentially work as an escrow agent, depending how they’re coded up. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:55:08
Right but this new crypto escrow company would supposedly charge lower fees than PayPal and that’s where ppl are pushing the value here. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:32:53
well defended rebuttal! Bravo :) You sir, dont understand how government/laws work, and how crypto cannot and will not decidedly overthrow the government, unilaterally abolish tax payments for all, while the government sits back and just lets it happen. Let alone by your predicted 2022 year! What a joke

Time will tell
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:09:05
have you read those? Do you understand how crypto can work in the real world? Please explain to me how you're right and I'm wrong other than posting the bitcoin white paper which doesnt explain how bitcoin will integrate into the REAL WORLD
@_date: 2018-08-02 15:07:46
Lol what a troll
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:19:02
I appreciate your nice response when I mostly dismissed your original claims as bs. As you’d expect I’m highly skeptical. So basically you like and approve of income tax purely because you’re not a federal employee and think that if you interpret the letter of the law and adhere to a couple loop holes, any non federal employee does not have to pay taxes? 
Have you actually done this for years and not paid any income tax? 
Totally get what you’re saying about the whole not everyone knows about this, but the mega rich LOVE their money and hire very expensive accountants whose sole job is to save them money through whatever legal vehicles/loop holes they can find. 
How is it that some random website on the internet since 2003 (15 years) knows the answers but the mega rich don’t? 
I’ll take some time to look into this further cuz I’m intrigued but it really sounds like some smoke and mirrors taking advantage of wordplay/legal loop holes in the effort to dodge your societal responsibility of paying taxes to support social programs. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:50:28
Everything’s on chain and the IRS likes their money... won’t be too hard to track people down eventually as they’ll adapt as the technology adapts. Crypto won’t be federally legal if everyone started skirting taxes by using crypto. If crypto is federally illegal, legal businesses won’t accept crypto for payment. You’re delusional to think otherwise. Sure if you want to live off the grid and exchange crypto in p2p Craigslist’s ads and lemon aid stands I guess you could make it work...

Why would quantum computing render bitcoin useless?

Let’s use our head here lol
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:48:56
Do people actually live on $3.5 Usd /month? I know this is unrelated but it’s pretty widely known that vene’s play a game called old school runescape and sell the in game gold they make for usd. If it’s $3.5/m no wonder they do that, you could easily earn $3.5/day playing an online video game
@_date: 2019-12-27 01:48:50
Any specific reasons why? Your post doesn’t give any fundamental reasons for it to push higher than it is today. What about the incoming halvening suggests it to jump 50% in value over the next 6 months?
@_date: 2018-11-05 22:04:39
If they rant it’s just because it’s so ridiculous to think crypto will overtake big banking anytime soon. To think anything else is delusional. IF someday crypto overtakes as a worldwide currency, it’ll for sure be some government backed project. The people of the world don’t understand crypto let alone trust it to store their money (outside of highly corrupt nations which may view crypto as a safe haven). The crypto model that is present today will never become what crypto enthusiasts believe it will achieve, let alone overthrow the worlds’ big banking system...
@_date: 2018-11-05 21:44:46
No one rants against it. Reporters just insistently ask bankers about crypto. Banks are not sweating crypto, not in the slightest lol

You can instantly deposit any money in your account (even money that you just received for 25 cents)

Very interesting didn’t realize symmetric crypto was considered quantum proof. Thanks!
