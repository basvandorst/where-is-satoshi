I guess I disagree with that entirely except with the fact that Bitfinex is worth less than their customer's have lost, which is a problem.  I have been through real world restructurings of real companies and the less something is worth, the more layers of the capital structure are getting converted or zeroed out.  The less something is worth, the more equity % you have to pay out or reward to or hand over to more senior parts of your capital structure (this skips over a lot of bankruptcy complexity, whatever) .  It's unclear how senior BFX is in the Bifinex capital structure, given that it's likely an illegal debt-like security in most jurisdictions and it likely does not legally replace the debt they owe to their customers.  Tbh, none of this makes sense and could fall apart.
And future revenues and prospects are probabilistically related to what they decide to do here.  The more they are willing to convert, the more likely the future prospects are dire and they are acting on that knowledge (and we learn about how dire it is based on how much they convert).
Do you dispute that the floor on BFX's value is zero, too?
But it's crypto, so who knows.  Maybe everyone gets rich and this all works out great.
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:19:04
The floor on the BFX value is zero.  How could it be anything else?  Also the equity value is dynamic -- the more they convert, the less its worth and separately, the more equity that they give likely the less their future income will be because it means the worse their prospects are.  These are all moving targets.  And this is setting aside the legality of any of this...

When a firm is facing bankruptcy or you are worried that it might be, as a creditor (which is what customers who can't get their money out are) you almost always want to act earlier than later.  You certainly never want to position yourself so that you are unready to exercise remedies.  Firms that find themselves against the wall burn cash and/or may take actions that will preserve their optionality at the expense of other stakeholders.  This happens all the time.  I'm an anonymous person on the internet, sure, but I'm also someone with actual real world experience with corporate restructuring.  Full disclosure: I have no such experience in Japan.
An adult doesn't wait; an adult makes the appropriate arrangements so that when stuff doesn't go there way, they are suitably prepared.  Good luck to everyone with exposure to Gox.  Hopefully it all works out well.

He also said that the team isn't good enough to take over the full development right now and that he would evaluate any future versions that team releases when they are released.

That was his point, the latent irony contained within the leader of a Bitcoin community acting in contradiction to the entire ethos of Bitcoin.  An open, decentralized, trustless, individual liberty/responsibility concept depended on a few authoritarian ideologues' graces for what was allowed to be discussed in its most prominent forum.

I've been on Reddit for 2 years. Ive been in Bitcoin since Tyler Cowen mentioned it in 2010.  I mined with a couple Radeons for years starting in 2011.  I wonder how many BTC that would have added up to with no selling along the way.   I work in finance and have probably discussed and explained it with several hundred people in my industry, walking them through the bullshit and FUD patiently and with respect while they thought I was crazy.  Time bore out the importance of Bitcoin and its value.  I'm very active in the space and care about it and the related community. My user name and variants are on Google.

Another retail facing fund, a super subscale one at that.
Look at the size there. Now calculate the % size of their BTC position.  I have more BTC than they do.  They represent 20bps of the whole GBTC BTC holdings. It's nothing.
If you really think the holders of GBTC are big-time institutional investors and not retail dumb money who are being exploited,  we can agree to disagree.  2% fees for a passive fund is alone a red flag.
There's also even a pretty obvious exploit designed into GBTC.
@_date: 2016-06-26 14:33:10
Why should anything trade at multiples of its NAV if its NAV is easily objectively valued and the underlying is super liquid?  Should a gold closed end fund trade at multiples of its NAV?
Do you understand why a stock for a company that produces cashflows trades at multiples of either its equity or its earnings (2 different things) and why that is different than something like a gold or Bitcoin fund?

No manager for an institutional investor would put their clients in GBTC.  They would be violating their fiduciary duty pretty clearly.  Any institution who has bought BTC would buy BTC direct or go through someone like Pantera and get the underlying BTC at the actual price.
The only people in GBTC are unfortunate ill-informed retail investors who are either BTC newbies or true believers.  At this point, even an advisor who manages retail money will no longer be able to put retail clients money into GBTC due to the broader application of the fiduciary standard under the new DOL framework.  They would open themselves up to being sued.
Edit: to add more.  I didn't know that it charges 2% fees per year.  That's what hedge funds charge to actively manage your money.  Most passive CEFs have fees that are below 0.5%.  Those fees are obscene, too.  They would open any advisor to a lot of scrutiny.
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:33:13
You think it's good for Bitcoin that the first experience retail investors will have with it is likely losing money?  BTC has to double from here for them to be in the black.
GBTC is modeled after this fund
Notice how that trades right around its NAV.  That's also one of the few ways investors can get direct exposure to actual gold.  
I didn't even notice that GBTC charges an obscene 2% before.  That's 5x more than what it was modeled after. Hedge funds charge 2% and those fees are coming in.
@_date: 2016-06-26 01:33:46
GBTC should be shut down by the SEC if Barry Silbert won't do it himself.  It's embarrassing to Bitcoin that it is allowed to be bought still. It's frankly unethical as an investment product manager.  lt trades at such a premium to its actual underlying BTC that any investor will lose money if they buy it unless BTC goes up 100%.  Just a terrible and unfair product. With 2% fees being the cherry on top.  Most passive funds have de minimis fees, under 0.50%.
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:09:57
It's an actively managed ETF sold to retail investors.  It can also shrink if those same investors redeem.  It's hard for me to put into context how small 13 million is for a fund.  If they have relatively high fees, say 1%, those fees would generate $130k in revenue, not even cover the expenses of a single investment professional.

The benefits of the tax deferment are worth 30-40%.  Much lower than the 100% ruinous premium GBTC trades at.
AMZN is a share in ownership of underlying cashflows of AMZN.  It's tough to objectively value and could be worth more fundamentally or worth less in the future.  
GBTC is easy to objectively value today.  That's why it's obscene and bad for Bitcoin.  Comparing its overvaluation to other things that may be overvalued doesn't help its case or matter.
@_date: 2017-01-03 18:18:47
GBTC also has extremely high fees. 2% (!), comparable to the management fees a traditional hedge fund charges on AUM.  
* A normal hedge fund will have a 200bps mgmt fee and get 20% of the carry.  
* A normal ACTIVELY managed mutual fund will get 100bps in fees and none of the carry.
* A normal ETF (by nature passive) will have fees below 50bps.  
The whole point of passive strategies is to save on expensive fund management.  GBTC charges more than most ACTIVE managers and for a passive strategy.  GBTC is a pretty scammy product created and managed by Barry Silbert's Digital Currency Group, [one that has run into trouble with the SEC]( and one which makes it so retail newbies get way overcharged for BTC (i.e. their first BTC experience is overpaying by 10-80% in 2016) , so the sooner the Winklevii can launch, the better for BTC.

The 2% is ridiculous on its face.
The separate premium to NAV issue ends up hurting unsophisticated retail investors.  It makes it unsuitable for them honestly just like products such as whole life insurance, variable annuities, and private REITs are not terrible products in themselves but are used to take advantage of unsophisticated retail investors.  And when you continue to market a product like this by pitching the retail arbitrage to HNWs, which is what they do, it doesn't come close to meeting my ethical hurdles. 
I'm in finance, and believe it or not, there are **some ethics** involved. ;) I wouldn't want my name or company associated with what they do and have done and likely will continue to do.

My point is that it's embarrassing and a negative for Bitcoin and people shouldn't let friends or strangers buy GBTC.  It's the worst, most reckless, least justifiable way to get Bitcoin exposure.

The conspiracy theories represent a special kind of stupidity.  This guy's a hammer who sees everything as nails.  No, Bitcoin, a cryptocurrency worth $6bn in total, is not subject to an overarching counterinsurgency campaign led by the Government or whatever.  
I weep for the community that people take this stuff seriously.  It plays to worst elements of the community's character and their deepest fears, the latent paranoia and suspicion of authority.  And those are some of the very same traits that made us all take Bitcoin seriously back when people told us it was a bubble or a cryptolibertarian wet dream or whatever pejoratives people threw it.
But indulging in conspiracy theorizing and flame wars over Bitcoin would really just be the community destroying Bitcoin.

This is false.  MEW was operated by an LLC of which "loud chick" (classy way to describe someone), loner programmer and another person are all voting members.  They hire people and build out MEW as a product and service (a lot of the work was helping people who make mistakes, or who have been scammed, or stopping people from getting phished, MEW was a big target).  Over time, 2 of the members want to do more with it and build it into something bigger, while 1 doesn't want to.  The 2 members and 19/20 of the people leave MEW to start something new and dissolve the LLC by its legal operating agreement (this is how LLCs work).  They also leave loner programmer the brand, the goodwill, and ALL its hooks into referrals for things like Shapeshift that generate revenue for MEW.
Everyone who has been around for awhile is confused but mostly fine with it.  A bunch of never before posted in r/Ethereum types come out of nowhere (a bunch of /biz threads where they used racist terms for the loner programmer and sexist terms for the loud chick) and talk crap about the woman and lose their minds.

The price action over the last 1 year?  The price action over the last 1 year?  The slowing in the rate of transaction growth?  The continued growth in transactions?  The falling numbers of individual miners?  The falling number of nodes?
In order to "prove" something with data, you need to be meticulous about what questions it can or cannot answer.  You have to be disciplined and highly numerate.
If you want rip everything and everyone down, I'm confident it will not be good for a fringe idea like Bitcoin.  Very confident.  Things are made valuable by people wanting to partake in them.  Revolutions don't happen because suchandsuch is provably the best idea -- they happen because a community of people adopt and embrace something and get more people to follow suit.  These new people come not on its pure merits, but based on the things that make them human, like wanting to be involved, seeing the benefits, liking the people behind it.  Bitcoin doesn't become a success because it's probably superior.  This isn't Math.  That's not how ideas or ecosystems win out.  Study history, study technological history, get context.

Nope, it's a suggestion.  This isn't my job, so appeals for hard data or GTFO are silly.  I can sell my way off this ship.  I'd prefer not to.  But when the collective shits on every useful Bitcoin service and company, every VC or financier, every aspect of government, and then turns on itself and rips apart people who disagree with them inside the collective, it's tough to want to be associated with it.  Feel free to disagree with this.
Examples from Reddit alone: 
* That AMA with the MIT guy was embarrassing.  People treated him vilely and half the comments were just BS about him being evil.  MIT is a key influencer in the world and tech.  That guy was totally reasonable and people ripped him apart with gotcha level bullshit and were surprised when he didn't respond within seconds.
* The Green Beret post.  A sizable portion of this community believes in conspiracy theories, which depend on lack of critical thinking, arrogance, and shitty probabilistic thinking.  Even the CSW posts reveal this vein.  It's the path of madness.
