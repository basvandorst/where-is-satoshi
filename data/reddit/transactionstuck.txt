yes and looks like we need a new developer team as the current one isn't doing shit. just sitting on their lazy asses with millions of dollars not being able to fix a simple issue.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:51:02
I have done my research and i want bitcoin unlimited as do other users who have the issue of slow confirmations and high fees.
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:50:36
Right we need bitcoin unlimited to fix this issue. Its the only compromise available.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:33:28
So why do I have to pay such a high fee now and 2 years ago I didn't need to? I was able to send large amounts paying less than 1$ easily with confirmations within 10 minutes. Obviously there is something wrong with the network and it needs to be fixed. I'm not the only one having this problem. Don't turn something simple into something so technical.

MINERS WE NEED BITCOIN UNLIMITED FAST!! ONLY WAY WE CAN FIX THIS
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:11:50
if it sucks then why is it worth 35bil currently lol?
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:44:36
How so?
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:49:40
Yes, we need bitcoin unlimited quickly. Its the best version for bitcoin and will make things faster again.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:46:10
So why aren't they listening (core team) to the users and fixing this issue? Is it because they are under control by blockstream and employed to stall bitcoin? I am sure many people other than me are complaining about it. Never had to wait this long for a transaction to confirm or pay such a high fee 1-3 years back.
@_date: 2017-05-28 09:35:24
Aren't they the ones who are in control of what goes on in the bitcoin network including the code? So how does it not have nothing to do with them? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:50:17
We need bitcoin unlimited, its the only solution to this. Segwit is only temporary.

@_date: 2017-06-17 10:53:04

@_date: 2017-06-14 09:29:10
ummm bip148 is a attack on bitcoin. read the whitepaper. 
also why do the core devs support bip148 and not segwit2x and the ny agreement? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 11:48:07
why these group of engineers blocking segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:52:24
UASF is very dangerous...
