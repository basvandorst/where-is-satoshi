This makes no sense at all.

Good thoughts, a topic alot of people in the community have tried to put to paper.  
often suggests that in order for bitcoin to succeed we should be spending it not hoarding it.  Although I don't agree on such an absolute action, I do believe in putting a fair portion of my bitcoins to work to further the success of crypto currencies and I choose to do that by taking stakes in BTC and LTC denominated ventures.  I see it as the equivalent of creating something of value for the network, such as a 'killer app' of some sort, but since I am not a programmer I make my mark by enabling others to create the value.  
Regarding bitcoin price versus security price I think the outcomes are tied to the specific business objectives and how they use and generate fiat/btc.  There are people way cleverer than me who would be able to expand on this.  
As an early adopter I treat it as a moral duty to invest a portion of my holdings to further the cause,  I'm lucky to be magnitudes beyond roi so my view is most definitely biased.

Sounds more like an investing/daytrading club, not a crypto club.  I would expect a crypto club to spend time and money on understanding the protocol, maybe releasing their own crypto currency as a way of understanding the fundamentals and learning how to secure coins.  Also maybe writing a simple application.  
Don't get me wrong I think an interest in the changing price is part of it and may help you get student's attention, but you will want to be careful to make sure that investing/price does not become the focus of your club.
Best of luck with it.  Let us know how it goes.

I prefer to take a more practical view.  You cannot afford to take such an absolute stance on this, it's too important.  Diversification is key, whatever your opinion may be.
When I put my 'the sky is falling' hat on all I can imagine is that when enough people wake up to the fact that we live in a fiat world, not a money world, shit will hit the fan so hard that most of your arguments will fall by the wayside as people panic to migrate into true stores of wealth.  It will happen so fast that you won't be able to react to it and you'll be left holding the bag if you don't plan and consider the possible outcomes.
Will bitcoin be the solution?  Maybe not.  Will the solution be an improvement on bitcoin?  There's no doubt in my mind.

Someone should create an indicator that calculates the collective intelligence of a reddit.  It would be a fascinating measure to compare against the price of a coin.

Funnily enough my failure was to rely on the anti virus that comes with windows 8.  Once I installed another AV product, the remote access viruses were found pretty quickly.  It was a humbling experience to say the least.

Ordered end of Jan, received and started mining start of October @ 58GH/s, just about to hit 5 BTC mined.  I have no issue with their products.  But I do take issue with their ability to deliver those products and the attitude of their senior representatives during public discourse.  I will not buy another BFL product, or a product associated with BFL management.

This is exactly why I like alternatives and their communities.  It opens up this world to untapped user base that may well contain that one person who creates the killer app that crypto currency needs.

As an early adopter I would say I'm apathetic, however observing the changing collective psyche of this subreddit as it rides the wave continues to be fun.  
A lot of the posts with a speculative theme (should I sell my car and buy bitcoins, wow the price just went up another dollar, hey I called it guys now I'm rubbing it in your face) are outright entertaining.  So many people being driven by their emotions instead of thinking critically.
I used come here for insight and ideas about the long term view but now I'm primarily reading for entertainment.

You think that BI will stop such articles being published because a parent company has an interest in bitcoin?  That is a patently naive viewpoint.  By linking said post you are simply playing into their game - increasing their viewership.  Well done, you just come off as a groupthinkdouchebag with a vendetta.

Some greek investors may well be moving more into precious metals and even trying bitcoin, but it's unlikely the mass population is doing this in volume.  Primarily because there is still way too much friction in the process of obtaining coins (no 'killer app' yet, so to speak).  If a company like Neo and Bee were already in place in Greece, it might be a different story.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:58:11

I am way into dollar profit at today's prices, on a BFL Single that started mining in October, but I would have made much more money by buying and holding bitcoin instead.
It makes about 0.04BTC/$40 a day at today's difficulty/price.

Stop dwelling on the past and think about how you can get back in the game now.  Realise the mistake you made (no wallet backup) and don't make that mistake again.
There's no benefit in beating yourself up over it, remember that it still takes conviction and critical thinking to put your money where your mouth is - nothing has changed in that regard since a Bitcoin cost a dollar.  It's primarily those with conviction that are winning, plus a few folk who took a punt and got lucky.

You are liable to pay tax on the capital gains at the point where you take your profit i.e. convert it from BTC to a fiat currency.  Bear in mind that if you are treating bitcoin profits as capital gains, your losses are also relievable, so if you are keeping good records and want to enter that minefield, it's an option.

If they are getting into your account when you have 2FA enabled it is probably one of two things.  They either have access to your desktop and can see everything you are doing, or they have replicated your 2FA.
Is your google authenticator backed up or used anywhere else apart from on your phone?  If not, it is most likely that you're infected with a remote access tool.
I'm not sure if you can check on havelock, but see if there are any IP access logs made available to you.  You can also email support on havelock and they may provide you with some more info to help you figure out what happened.
I feel your pain, something similar happened to me and I was pretty shaken by it.

You were pretty clear that you're a competent person that knows about computers, so this statement makes no sense.
Sorry to be harsh, but arrogance in your perceived understanding of security is your downfall here.  The 'normal guy' and 'mum' scenarios don't cut it.  Bitcoin isn't mainstream yet and it won't be mainstream until 'normal guy' and 'mum' don't even realise they are using it.
Chalk it up to a lesson learned.
