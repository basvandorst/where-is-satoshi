Wow. First we had roger ver vs. OKCoin. Now mike Hearn vs. china mining.

It's funny cause okcoin's block explorer actually showed the right data during the stress test. Lol

Be interesting to see who wins the European market. Coinbase or Kraken.

Miners will get transaction fees from the network.

Truth be told, all the startups should work together to make their products look aligned

And they have a central bank to fix it. And a government to provide shelter and make things right.

I don't have the research no. But basically when you talk to someone to buy it who doesn't need it right now but you're telling them to speculate and hoard ahead of future demand, the first pushback you get is all about early adopters, unfair distribution, pyramid scheme etc. 
When you think of it as an investment, anyone can be a potential buyer of bitcoin. But we should really be only promoting it to those that need bitcoin right now. The hoarders can all figure this out themselves.

There will come a day when all fiat received will be converted to Bitcoin.

GYFT should let you sell the GYFT card for BTC. It would destroy Coinapult's lock thing

Best way is to use Kraken. For sure. 
You'll get set up real quick

What he means is billions of people will be sending fiat via text, it's just that in the background, it's sending btc. 
Won't mean everyone will be holding a bitcoin balance. 
In fact, it may be illegal to hold a large bitcoin balance.

Pretty sure Beijing is the center of fintech

Not a bad idea. Takes so long to sign up that it can only work at baseball games.

What's the point of this? Coinbase and OKCoin are already at 0% deposit fees...
@_date: 2015-03-30 15:25:43
Bank fees apply anywhere I think - but OKCoin is 0% aside from any fees you'd get charged anyways. 
I don't think BitStamp pays for your regular bank fees.
