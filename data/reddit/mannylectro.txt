What does this have to do with democrats. Republican have the majority. They could do it without them but they can't even agree on this because Trump is asking for more stupid stuff at the last minute.

Are they selling the 3 years low bitcoins ? I would love to buy some at that crazy discount
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:19:58
a permanent correction ? What the hell does that even mean ? That bitcoin will remain lock at the same value until the end of the universe ? O_o
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:33:24
Just say you lost your private key :D

I'm new to crypto, but I wouldn't call anything a crash until at least going back to the price from 6 months ago.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:30:33
Bitcoin seems to resist quite well above 11k. I'm not sure its gonna dip more than that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:20:18
If you judge drops by values in a growing market you will find each drop worst than the previous ones...

The best way not to suck at hodling is by not selling ;)

Not only is it being built but its currently being tested with a lot of success.

A gift from a friend ?

I would say don't put everything, but if you don't have any urgent loan or need why not put a good 50% in crypto ?
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:28:43
Well if they have a deal with Coinbase they don't really need to make real blockchain transactions.

This is the secret of crypto. It is a bubble that can pop an infinite amount of times while always becoming bigger everytime.

Social networks are becoming such a mess. This is scary. I am tired of witnessing these type of attacks.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:59:28
Sounds like a plan ;)
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:51:01
I just checked it. With my pc I could earn about 65 euros per month... Not bad... I'm just a bit worried about letting my pc run at max speed 24/7.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:51:08
No idea. They need to test it a lot more to make sure it works 100% under every conditions. You wouldn't want people to loose money while using it. I heard something about it being deployed early next year.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:49:26
But how are we going the reach the moon without memes to run the engines ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:16:32

Well this made me realise that my small company (I'm CEO) has 4 high end pc's with killer graphic cards and CPU doing nothing 16hours/24 and we don't pay electricity in our offices. I guess we all know what's going to happen :D ! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:51:50
Dozen of millions of people in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:41:07
Yep... Don't they have better things to do ? People must feel alone at The_Donald right now :D !
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:23:39
No but you can buy food with it :D
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:44:42
I'll sell him one bitcoin for 8000 !
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:19:50
Good luck to you ! This would drive me mad :D !

Keep us posted ! Please !

Let's say you have a candy (1 bitcoin). I want your candy, but I'm not the only one. A lot of people want to buy that candy. After talking to everyone you agree that you are ready to sell your candy for 10 dollars. So you tell everyone that for 10 dollars you will sell them your candy.
An American in the crowd comes with a 10 dollar bill. A French comes with 8.58 euros (10 dollars), A Japanese with 1141.22 yens (10 dollars) and so on.
A bitcoin is usually worth as much everywhere, but the money you buy it with is not worth the same depending on where you are ;) !

Or maybe its not sunstainable to wish for 9 billion human beings to all have individual vehicles they let sitting in a garage or a parking spot for 90% of the time...
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:43:54
Waow man it worked, it's definitely moving right now ;) with +2% !
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:00:08
Maybe develop a way to signal that you are still active ? Some sort of regular (every 20 years) check.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:52:18
Well not hard to believe we're going to reach 10k before Christmas :) !
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:11:21
6.25 ! WTF ? :D
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:50:51
It was actually pretty good when it started :(
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:49:09
I did this about 5 times before learning my lesson. I bought two month ago and just got back to my initial investment. I will never do this again.
Just HODL boys ! In the long run it changes nothing and its a lot less risky.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:42:40
Because they exist and are really good at this little game wether you believe it or not
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:23:15
I know quite a lot of people here don't like platforms such as coinbase but do I have reasons to worry if my Bitcoins are in there during and after the fork ? How will I be affected ?
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:54:10
Yep, I learned my lesson too. I bought Bitcoin a month ago and I am still below what I originally invested because of that kind of stupid panic selling and buying (and coinbase fees... yep I know...).
Never again. Time to HODL !!!
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:01:59
You are talking about the average american and "legal" vewiers.
How many people in the entire world will watch it illegally in the following 24 hours :D ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:19:55
Except the episode is about the main characters realising they mined some bitcoin a long time ago and are now rich. This might intrigue a few people.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:05:30
The show will be pirated and watched all over the world by a lot more than 12 million people

Bitcoin Crash*
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:58:22
In my country they ask for a second proof of ID that I simply don't have...
They seem to often ask too much of users to get an account up and running
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:07:24
What a day !

The common ancestor could die, or survive longer than new branches. It depends on how well it is adapted to its environment.

Hey I didn't say I am for techno feudalism. I'm just saying sharing resources instead of wasting them should be the way to go. We can't keep going like that anyway, unless we start exploiting resources on the rest of the solar system.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:28:59
Ok I'm new here too but I think you are making a mistake by thinking in dollars.
If you have 1 bitcoin now you will also have 1 of that "new bitcoin". The value of this new bitcoin and the current one will immediately change based on what people think of them... I guess ?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:07:54
I fucking knew it. I did that same mistake about 5 times before and lost of fucking lot of money. And like the 4 last times I knew it was a mistake and yet I panicked and sold like a newbie and again lost money.
THIS IS THE LAST TIME !!
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:14:24
Yep I can confirm that Gdax requires two forms of ID...
Maybe it's an European restriction ?

I put all my christmas gifts money on bitcoins thinking it would maybe go up 20% before the end of december, allowing me to buy more stuff for the family. 2 days later I have exceeded what I was aiming for.
