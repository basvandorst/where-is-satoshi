Biggest issue seems to be bank hostility to Bitcoin businesses wanting to set up bank accounts. There needs to be clear guidance from federal agencies that give banks the go ahead to permit Bitcoin companies to work with them. Right now banks are wary because of lack of regulation and fear of clampdown by government. This uncertainty needs to be squashed with clear guidance.

He actually said "digital currencies" and that could easily just be a centralized Paypal digital token (like the Amazon coin).  He also never said he would integrate Bitcoin.
It's encouraging that he owns Bitcoin, but as he said he owns it purely to see how it works, so he can take the best ideas and put them into his own "digital currency" for Paypal.

I wrote a very small app that allows you to check your balance by loading the public keys (no private keys, so no risk of your phone being stolen)

yes you only need a keypair.  A wallet just stores all the keypairs.  A bitcoin client takes your keypairs and searches the blockchain for transactions paid to one of your keys and updates your balance accordingly.
@_date: 2011-08-12 22:03:52
step 1. generate a keypair using vanitygen or by just picking a random 256bit number (make sure it's random!) and then calculating the public key from it.
step 2. create a QR code from the base58 encoded key (output from vanitygen, begins with a '5')
step 3. create a wooden QR code 
step 4. place wooden QR code in a safe.
step 5. buy bitcoins and send them all to the public address

I mean that blockchain.info doesn't immediately index new firstbits addresses, so they can take a time from use to appear in their index - or at least it was like that last time I looked.  You can test this by sending coins to a new address and then checking the /fb/ url to see if it's there yet.

what others are saying - wait for your bitcoin-qt client to sync then it will appear
alternatively open debug console (help-&gt;debug window-&gt;console) then dump the private key from your wallet

then create a wallet on blockchain.info (use a VERY SECURE PASSWORD) then go to 'import/export' then do 'import private key' and paste the long key string (begins with a 5) and your balance will be accessible on blockchain.info.
But probably better keeping it in bitcoin-qt.... remember to encrypt your bitcoin-qt wallet!!! (Settings-&gt;encrypt wallet)

You should bear in mind that many of the more esoteric script opcodes were disabled after [CVE-2010-5137](
I think the first advanced use of scripts is likely to come in assurance contracts for e.g. micropayment protocols, or maybe some form of split key N of M from mobile devices, but without a set of committed developers behind them to prototype some code it's not going to happen soon, everyone is far too busy building services that accept normal bitcoin transactions (which is a very worthwhile effort!)

OP - sorry for your loss, but brainwallets are such a spectacularly bad idea I hope they die out soon.  Really the bitcoin wiki should advise against all use.  Firstly people can't generate secure keys, it's just impossible - secondly, people make mistakes and forget about change addresses, and lose money, and if they aren't using change addresses, then sending bitcoins from an address and reusing it is bad practice anyway (since it reveals the public key)
Put simply, brain wallets need to die soon before more people lose their money.

it's encrypting data on the server side - and the server can block after a number of incorrect tries.  If it was protecting a local key then I would agree with you - since a bruteforce over a four digit pin is dumb, but the server can just block after (I think four) attempts.  So actually it's a real concrete improvement.  You should study the source code or at least read what the improvement is, before criticising it.
The additional risk here is that people will use their bank pins on blockchain - since the pin is stored on the server, a server-side compromise would reveal this pin - so please choose distinct pins here.

just remember that if you generated keys in bitcoin-qt then at some point (probably during first run) your wallet was unencrypted on your hard disk with your private keys (before you encrypted it).

bitcoin-qt will keep an address pool of, I think, 100 addresses, so when you created new addresses it probably took them from the address pool.

Say you had 100 BTC and you wanted to make it so you could only withdraw a maximum of 1 BTC a day for the next 100 days.
To do this, you create and broadcast a multi output transaction that sends 100 BTC in 100 txout of 1 BTC to an address you control.
Next, create 100 transactions from this address that use nLockTime to restrict the validity of the transaction to after a certain date - e.g. the first one you send the first BTC with date of tomorrow, and so on.  Make sure each of the 100 transactions consumes a different 1 BTC from the address.
Now you have 100 transactions which will each slowly become valid over 100 days.  You then destroy the private key for the address containing the 100 bitcoins so the only way of paying from this address is via these transactions.
Each day, broadcast the transaction for that day - it doesn't matter if you miss a day, as each transaction uses a different txin from the original 1 x 100 BTC split.
Of course, I should add this doesn't prevent theft, since someone could just steal all 100 of the unsent transactions and send them.  If you want to prevent theft then instead of destroying the private key for the address containing the 100 bitcoins, store it in a save place and then you can 'revoke' all the future transactions by just sending whatever is left on the address to a new address.

yes, your keys can be anywhere, and any device that has them can spend bitcoins that are on those keys - for example I share my 'checking account' private keys between bitcoin-qt and blockchain.info (normally less than 50-60 BTC) and I have 'savings' keys that I keep offline.

set up a merchant account on [coinbase.com]( and anyone can send you bitcoins for goods/services and coinbase will deposit USD directly into your bank account for 0% fees (first 1M USD transacted, 1% fees after).
The main issue here is your customers getting hold of bitcoins - it's  not quite as easy as this video says, because the customer has to wire (US) or SEPA transfer (EU) the money into the exchange, which can often take a few days.  However, once more people have bitcoins for general buying of goods (or from selling goods themselves), this issue should hopefully abate.

transaction fees won't start coming down until the block limit is increased.  the block limit won't be increased until all (or a large number of nodes) are upgraded to 0.8.1.  A large number of nodes won't be on 0.8.1 until after May 15th.  So maybe by around June or so, it will be possible to raise the block limit, and hopefully transactions should go through faster meaning fees won't have to be higher than normal.

The amount that the next recalculation is 'faster than expected' is equal to the % increase - so at the moment if the increase remains at around 25% per recalculation then the block reward halving should come 25% sooner - so bitcoinclock says 156 weeks so that makes it around the beginning of January 2016.

the age of the coin in the blockchain has an effect on the cost of the transaction - it sounds like since you sent the coin one way, and then almost immediately sent it back, then it would have been a very young coin thus required a higher fee.
Check the wiki [technical section]( for more info on this.
Your 0 fee transaction will confirm eventually when the input age exceeds the amount that makes it valid.  You might potentially need to retransmit in a day or two - come back here or PM me if you need help on how to retransmit.

it's a good question whether to report a capital gain when the USD is on mtgox.com and not in your bank account - I've always thought that it would become a taxable event when transferring back to my bank, but if you view mtgox.com as a bank then the actual taxable event is when you sold at 144/coin.
however, if you view that the 2880 in mtgox.com was not your money but just mtgox money then the taxable event only occurs in the future when you actually cash completely out.

Anyway - exchanges already do KYC and AML verification for large transactions, so the movement in/out of fiat already trackable.  It's purchases in bitcoin that aren't at the moment.

it's very hard to know but history has shown that typically after a weekend, prices tend to increase a bit as money clears banks into mtgox and places like that.  But only buy what you can afford to lose if bitcoin plummets to $0.00

bitmit.net generates a unique bitcoin address for that transaction and then shares that address with you via the website - so only you could send to that address.  Don't worry - it should go through fine.
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:19:18
a wallet address is just a hash of a public key.  I believe that blockchain.info, with the chrome wallet verifier extension is very secure, if you pick a long passphrase... I use it to hold my BTC.
Public/private/key/wallet/address gets quite complex - I recommend you read up on bitcoin.org and come back with specific questions
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:42:33
yes but the problem was that as the block limit increased, then a bug (feature? depending on who you ask) manifested in pre-leveldb clients whereby the number of open locks on the database was exceeded causing transactions to fail relay
There is an deeper analysis of this [here](
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:52:18
you can 'archive' your address
then on the archive page, you get to click a few check boxes, then 'delete key' and delete the private key (via a scary looking dialog box!) then unarchive and your key is now watch only.
Bear in mind I do not know the specifics of the offsite/amazon S3 backup that piuk does - it's possible that if you delete a private key from blockchain and then later your password and blockchain and everything gets horribly compromised, the attacker might be able to retrieve your (deleted) private key from S3.  I've been meaning to ask piuk about this actually (this attack depends on getting your password to work, since the S3 backups are still encrypted)
@_date: 2013-08-24 19:49:35


or a bad random number generator used for ECDSA signature generation
I think the number one reason will be people losing wallets e.g. disk corruption, forgetting password, dying, rather than any active attacks
Number two will be people not understanding paper wallets and change addresses, and losing bitcoins through that.

it is possible to buy 'mining stock' i.e. an investment in mining - [ASICMiner]( does this.  Alternatively you can pool with others e.g. on bitcointalk and then have a rig hosted somewhere, but that relies on getting your hands on a mining rig.
@_date: 2013-08-31 08:58:28
I would start by putting the txid and the source address (that you control) in this post, or on bitcointalk, or somewhere that Google will index it - then make it as popular as possible, then hope that the person who gets your 2.5BTC will Google it and find this post, and contact you on reddit.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:15:25
As other poster said, this could never happen accidently because of the huge keyspace (2^256 keys) - however is perfecftly possible to happen deliberately, for example I keep all my keys safely encrypted in bitcoin-qt but I keep a few of them for my 'checking account' funds on blockchain.info which allows me to spend bitcoins while on the move - so the keys are in two places.
One important caveat here is that you should never have keys in more than one instance of bitcoin-qt because of the high chance that [Change]( transaction addresses might not propagate between the two.  I always spend via blockchain for this reason (blockchain doesn't generate Change addresses)
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:34:32
Sorry to hear about your loss.  The only way this could have happened is that your password was compromised - so perhaps you used it on another system/website, or you have malware on your computer.  You might want to consider enabling [two factor authentication]( and using the My Wallet Verifier Firefox/Chrome [extension](
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:56:09
try backing up your wallet.dat and then deleting everything else (or to be safe, just rename the directory) but putting your wallet.dat back - then reloading bitcoin-qt - it'll have to resync the blockchain, but that's probably the safest way.
if not - you might have to manually pull your private keys from wallet.dat and reinstall bitcoin-qt then manually reimport (hint: commands are dumpprivkey and importprivkey)

Just a counterpoint - not saying I believe this, but it's a counter point :)
The key selling point with bitcoin is that it allows people to transfer value from A to B (across the world) with low transaction cost, quickly, easily and securely.
This key value doesn't have any link to price.
Therefore, one could argue that the price of bitcoin is largely irrelevant to its success (in fact it's far better to have a stable price rather than how it is now).  Therefore, why should the price keep rising?
@_date: 2013-06-02 10:23:49
estimate you'll get your 5Gh in maybe 3 months time.
By then, the difficulty will be about 70 million, meaning that your rig will be earning 0.04BTC a day or about 5USD a day at current prices.
history has shown that most mining investments pay off in about 6-8 months.
You might be better off buying 2 bitcoins.

blockchain.info would have emailed you a wallet when you set it all up - you can create a new account and upload that wallet, if you really need to get to your bitcoins.  It's encrypted with the same password you use to login to blockchain.info

I think you have it spot on here - if you can pass the savings onto your customers then you might find that people are willing to go ahead and buy some bitcoins in order to transact with you.
The hassle here is not with the merchant - since companies like bit-pay and coinbase make it very easy for any merchant to accept bitcoins, the hassle is with the purchaser, because there simply aren't very many people on the planet with disposable liquid capital in bitcoins, so the number of customers who you can transact with is so limited.
The solution here is to do both, accept 'traditional' payment systems like Paypal but give people the option of sending you bitcoins as well and explain the advantages to them (it will cost them less to buy your goods) - this will slowly mean that people will be willing to hold more bitcoins as they see more merchants accepting them, and the benefits of paying in bitcoins.
Really though, it's zero cost for you as a merchant, you can continue to accept through paypal, and at the same time, accept through bitcoin with very little hassle.  You might as well do it!

wow what a terribly misinformed blog post...
Firstly, on the issue of NSA+Google - if the US gov comes to Google with a signed court order asking for data, what do you expect them to do?  Fight it?  Well, actually they already do fight it, but if you go back to the court and they still say you have to give up the data, then really Google has no choice here.  It sounds like you have a problem with an intrusive government on people's lives, but you can't blame the ISPs for adhering to the law.
Secondly - on the subject of NSA somehow inserting some code into bitcoin - this is purely nonsense because the software is open source and the core developers would immediately notice something like this, and the miners would not switch to a version that included this anyway because it would not be in their best interests to scare people off bitcoin.

microtransactions (e.g. pay per ipv4 packet) are possible using [assurance contracts]( between two parties - a bit like how they do it in high frequency trading, by agreeing a max amount each party can go outstanding before settling up - they don't use 3 day ACH transfers :)
A real world analogy for this - is casinos where you go to the cashier and exchange your USD for casino chips - validation is done at that point to determine that your dollars are valid, and you have a credit to perform 'microtransactions' at low latency at the blackjack table, before coming back later and cashing them out with another validated transaction.  This can be extended to casino credit where cash isn't even exchanged - same thing can be done in Bitcoin using Contracts.

I would install bitcoin-qt, encrypt your wallet with a very very long passphrase, generate a 1000 or so keypool addresses, wait for the blockchain, send all your bitcoins there, then put your wallet.dat on a USB stick.  I don't believe in paper wallets either because there's too much chance for change address screwups.
@_date: 2013-04-22 17:45:55
do you want to spend from your smartphone, or just view your balance?
you can import your wallet.dat into blockchain.info but this means having to secure a second way of getting to your private keys (enable two factor authentication, and choose a really strong password)
another way would be if you just want read only access, just import your public keys (addresses beginning with 1) into blockchain.info

being in bubble is bad for bitcoin - the strengths of bitcoin are not about making a quick buck by pumping the price then dumping when it hits $250 - the strengths lie in a frictionless payment system that enables the digital economy.
so if this crash means that more merchants will feel comfortable about accepting it since the price will be more stable - then it's a good thing for bitcoin.

blockchain.info online wallet is secure as long as you **use a strong password** and optionally enable two factor authentication, and optionally enable a second password to make transactions.  The key thing here is using a strong password.
Using the My Wallet Verifier extension is also a good idea - this protects against malware on your computer modifying the javascript to steal your keys, and also against a compromised version of blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:55:05
no it's very unlikely you were hijacked, if the blockchain.info javascript had been compromised then there would be a load of people posting right here saying they had alerts.  The blockchain.info two factor emails have been a bit slow recently.
Note: you can enable chrome extensions in incognito mode.  Also, helps to specify which blockchain.info chrome extension you are using - there are two - one is the verifier which verifies the hashes of the downloaded javascripts from blockchain.info, and the other one is a complete version of the blockchain.info javascript packaged as a chrome extension that runs totally from the extension directory.  The latter is probably more secure for the ultra paranoid :)

vircurex got hacked a while back and all the old deposit addresses and private keys were leaked.  potentially you sent to an old address, in which case your bitcoins are Gone.
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:52:38
are you using bitcoin-qt?  in which case, every time you send a transaction then it sends the [change]( back to a new address, so if gradually after 100 transactions you will have bitcoins spread across 100 private keys - so which private key are you going to write down and keep in your brain?
N.B. Writing down the private key works where you can control change addresses and where you send bitcoins from - e.g. blockchain.info

not exchangable unfortunately, there is no way to trust that a seller of a vanity address hasn't kept the private key - so not really like DNS entries, for example.  (before someone nitpicks me, I know there are ways to have a third party generate a secure vanity address public/private key pair via secret sharing but I am talking here about an address already in use on the blockchain i.e. it has a firstbits)

another option (and what I've used in my sheet for a few months now) is to just put all your public keys into a blank blockchain.info wallet (public keys only) then create a crappy throwaway password then use the equation
    =regexextract( importData(" "\d+") / 100000000
this means there's only one HTTP request, and you can just add/remove public keys via blockchain's import public key interface
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:30:45
they could probably mitigate partially against this by displaying the balance of the address after it's autocompleted - after all they must have a database of all the firstbits, so storing the balance too would be low cost.   People are likely to notice that the balance of the destination address is waay off what they expected.

bitcoins can still be sent an address that is offline - when you bring the wallet.dat online again it will sync and allow you to spend your bitcoins - or you can use several solutions that allow you to make offline transactions if you don't want to have your keys online.  YOu can also view your balance on an address by going to blockchain.info and typing the address in.
So in summary, it doesn't matter if your wallet is online or offline, you can still receive bitcoins to the addresses contained inside.

21million comes from the series:
* 6 blocks per hour
* each block initially contains 50 btc
* so that's 7200 btc a day
* so 2628000 btc a year
Satoshi Nakamoto wanted the number of btc being issued to half every 4 years
so every 4 years there are 10512000
this halves every 4 years (the bounty drops from 50, to 25, then 12.5 and so on) so in the next 4 years there will be 5256000 generated, then 2628000 then 1314000... it's a series that tends to 10512000 * 2 = 21024000
so the origin of the 21million is 6 * 50 * 24 * 365 * 4 *2 = 21024000

Welcome to Bitcoin! It sounds like you have between 100 and 200 Mh/sec kit - it's almost certainly not worth mining unless you just want to do it for fun (and have free electricity - remember there is a difference between free electricity and stolen electricity).

since you were using 2FA they didn't get into blockchain - so they must have obtained your private key(s) somehow.  Options include:
 - Your backups were stored elsewhere, perhaps in your email, with weak password, someone stole them.  Were the keys generated on blockchain.info, or imported from somwhere else.
 - You use the android app which the failed RNG and sent transactions that allowed private key disclosure
 - You used the android app and had malware on your phone - was it rooted?

which bitcoin software are you using?  To answer I will assume bitcoin-qt but if it's something else then the answers might change
1. Yes, but if you spend any bitcoins then the [Change]( from your transaction will go to a new address that might not be in your wallet - bitcoin-qt generates new Change addresses in batches of 100 so depending on how many transactions you've made, you might find that your keys for new addresses are not in your backup. **Key Message** make a new backup each time you spend from bitcoin-qt
2.  Yes, the keys are the same regardless of whether the wallet is encrypted or not.  But see 1. above for caveat
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:21:33
don't store them in mtgox.  I personally think brain wallet is overkill and vulnerable to just picking a bad passphrase.
I personally recommend either bitcoin-qt with a strong passphrase (two factor - something you know, and something you possess - the wallet.dat) or blockchain.info with a strong passphrase.
Definitely not mtgox though.

if that doens't work, delete the blockchain data files (they are in %appdata%\bitcoin) (DO NOT DELETE YOUR WALLET.DAT!) then run the bitcoin-qt client again and let it sync the entire blockchain again.
These instructions are assuming you are on Windows - the location of the blockchain is different on other platforms.
@_date: 2013-04-04 00:51:50
I agree this is worth doing - two factor protects against the 'over the shoulder' attack as well as certain keylogger attacks, but doesn't protect against blockchain.info servers being compromised since your wallet is still only protected by the strength of your passphrase.  Choose a strong passphrase!
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:36:26
gmaxwell is right.  Brain wallets are a spectacularly bad idea.  Humans cannot generate secure random numbers, also there is far too much chance of forgetting the key, and also of accidentally messing up Change addresses.

public reddit comments might not be the best place to discuss this - there will be a lot of people PMing you trying to persuade you to let them try and 'recover' your bitcoins - be very wary.  Perhaps it's worth getting onto instant messenger with someone - you could try joining the  channel on chat.freenode.net - or pick someone on this board you think you can trust a little bit and PM them.
It sounds to me like you made a backup using some sort of backup program, so getting your bitcoins back is a matter of making sure that the backup contains your wallet.dat - it should be in &lt;your user dir&gt;\AppData\Local\Bitcoin\wallet.dat - where &lt;your user dir&gt; is C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt; on windows XP and C:\users\&lt;username&gt; on more modern OS.

yes - the password is applied to the wallet.dat file so if you backup a wallet.dat with the password Monkey and put it in a safe, then it will always be Monkey on that file even if you later change it to Farm on your computer.
If you feel your password is compromised then you need to find all copies of the wallet.dat with the compromised password and destroy them - or move your coins to a clean wallet.

blockchain.info supports two passwords, the main password you enter on the main screen that unlocks your public keys to display things like your balance and transactions, and a secondary password to encrypt your private keys that has to be entered when you send bitcoins.  To enable the second password you need to go to settings-&gt;Security and enable it there.  it's not on by default.
There should be no issues exporting from blockchain.info regardless of whether you have one or two passwords, you just need the private key which starts with a 5 and looks a bit like this
    5KZuEBVG5469bbatW5E2G3GoHVPzWHX9DJfpgXGq9owD7AorTrw
to export from blockchain.info, go to 'import/export' then 'export unencrypted' then select 'bitcoin-qt' format.  Then look for the address you wish to export and there will be the private key labelled 'priv' - copy that to clipboard.
then on bitcoin-qt open debug console by going to help-&gt;debug window-&gt;console then you need to unlock your wallet using yout bitcoin-qt password
   walletpassphrase &lt;password&gt; 600
then import the key
   importprivkey 5LongStringBeginningWith5
it will then take about 10-15 minutes to rescan the blockchain - it will look like bitcoin-qt has hung but in fact it's importing your key.  Then you have your blockchain.info key in bitcoin-qt.  Repeat the importprivkey command for each private key
Afterwards: make sure to clear your clipboard as it contains your key!  Also, you should lock your wallet on bitcoin-qt with the walletlock command
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:32:32
the reward for verifying a block is that you get to enclose a generation transaction of, currently 25 bitcoins (dropping by half every four years). You also get to take all the difference between the 'in' values and 'out' values (commonly called 'fees') and collect those.
So right now I'm seeing blocks that are rewarding miners 25 BTC and maybe between 0.1 and 0.5 BTC in fees, because the network is pretty busy and so miners can be selective.
Once the coinbase reward has dropped, around 2030s, then the majority of the reward will be fee and not coinbase.

it's probably a bad idea to use two apps that modify the wallet on two different machines, for the reasons that damnreddit21 says - the keys wil diverge.  You could try using electrum on both which uses a [deterministic wallet]( but I would personally recommend only having one instance of bitcoin-qt and then if you need to access the bitcoins elsewhere, export the private keys into blockchain.info and access them from there.

retailers will usually broker their payment processing through services such as bitpay.com which do an instant calculation on the rate - so under the hood it's priced in USD but it presents you a BTC price - so yes, the value wil change dramatically - for example I bought an ironkey earlier today for 0.52BTC from bitcoinstore.com, and now the same key is priced at over a BTC... you win some you lose some - bitcoinstore.com got the same USD price in their bank account though.

keep your wallet backup safe!  You'll use that in case you lose your computer and have to restore everything.  In the meantime, if you want to use a mobile wallet then I recommend setting up an online wallet at blockchain.info then using one of the mobile wallets from there.  You can either send your bitcoins from your bitcoin-qt wallet to your blockchain.info wallet, or you can export your private keys from your bitcoin-qt wallet and import them into blockchain.  Either way, keep your password for both wallets very secret and very safe.

bitcoin's lack of anonymity is a real issue.  I was in Berlin recently and very reluctant to spend my BTC because I knew that network analysis would be able to link my spend with e.g. my other assets, or work out how many bitcoin I had.  To make the purchase I had to plan in advance and make sure I had a pot of pre-mixed bitcoins, and then use an app that allowed me to coin control to spend from that pot rather than any other, then any change from that had to be mixed back into my main bitcoin account - it's basically a real pain.
now imagine my salary is being paid in bitcoin, and I have a bitcoin bank account - I certainly don't want that information public.  This does need to be solved - and made easy to use for the average punter.
I find it quite ironic that the US gov is all up in arms about bitcoin's anonymity and how it can be used for evil, when I see it completely the other way, I feel far less anonymous when using bitcoin than using any other payment type (even CC - because the merchant I'm buying from can't see my salary or bank account balance)
@_date: 2013-05-13 09:22:39
blockchain keeps the last 50 (?) wallets in S3 storage - so if you know the original wallet identifier you could request for piuk to retrieve the old backups from S3 then you should be able to get the btc back.  Important that you don't make too many modificiations to your wallet.
Did you get a new email with the json.aes when you added the new address - that should contain the private key encrypted with your password (if you can remember it)
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:19:08
yes I've upgraded many times and the wallet.dat is always kept - when you upgrade to 0.8.1 the blockchain data will upgrade which can take some time and you shouldn't interrupt this process.  As you've already got multiple backups if anything really really terrible happens (like power cut and your house floods during an earthquake as the blockchain is writing) then you can always wipe %appdata%\bitcoin\* drop your wallet.dat down and reinstall bitcoin-qt and it'll all be there again.
@_date: 2013-04-01 22:00:50

I have the same private keys in both my bitcoin-qt and blockchain.info wallets - the key here is not to spend on bitcoin-qt if the transaction you spent in blockchain.info hasn't appeared yet.  i.e. everything is fine except for
1. spend on blockchain.info when bitcoin-qt is not running
2. start bitcoin-qt and while the blockchain is updating, or while the transaction still has 0 configurations, spend in bitcoin-qt
this can cause an attempted double spend and you have to go into bitcoin-qt and manually remove the bad transaction, which is a pain.

if you get warnings saying you shouldn't log in then you probably shouldn't login - perhaps there is a man in the middle device somewhere mangling the javascript (very very very unlikely - more likely that their DDOS prevention system is blocking some GETs)
The reason why you did not get these verification errors in incognito is that, by default, extensions are not enabled in incognito, so you're actually less secure accessing blockchain.info like that, unless you enable in incognito mode (type chrome://extensions in your browser, and enable this)
The javascript thing is a theoretical attack against the blockchain.info servers where a malicious bit of javascript is added into the code on the website to steal the in-memory decrypted private keys from users' browsers.  The blockchain.info verifier (that you have installed) would detect this (if it's enabled!) - and the blockchain.info extension sidesteps this threat entirely by running the scripts from your local computer.
If your local machine is compromised then all bets are off, of course.

usually if your rent includes utilities then the landlord has the right to charge a levy if you are using 'heating and higher than expected electricity bills from appliance use' but this varies by jurisdiction and whether your landlord notices, so bear that in mind - maybe read your rental contract carefully.

Correct.  transactions could be made offline without internet, but with no way to distribute blocks to secure the blockchain, bitcoin would not work without some form of network running.
However, your bitcoins would still hold value and when the internet came back, you could start spending again.

on Windows you could create a new user and set the bitcoin data directory to be encrypted with EFS then use smartcard authentication.  This stores the EFS keys on the smartcard.
Note: there are a lot of ways to screw this up, including leaving the administrator EFS unlock keys not on the smart card - unless you're a windows active directory wizard you might make mistakes setting this up!

You're backing up your encrypted private keys (encrypted with your login password)

true - but it's gradual improvements here - for example, you can't say that adding the ability to encrypt your bitcoind wallet.dat was bad because it didn't solve all the problems of a malware infested machine?
I consider any improvement in security to still be an improvement even if it doesn't solve all the problems.  It's wrong to not add an improvement because it's not perfect.
For info - if you're on Windows on a laptop with a smartcard reader, then you can pretty easily get quite a good level of security by creating a new user account with smart card authentication, then encrypting your %appdata%\bitcoin folder with EFS, and purging your EFS administrator key.  There's lots of ways to screw this up though, I might actually write a guide on this some time.

your blockchain.info wallet is already protected by a passphrase
you can add an additional second layer of encryption on the private keys so you would have to enter this second passphrase if you wished to spend, is this what you mean?
you can also export your private keys (unencrypted) from blockchain.info and then import into bitcoin-qt - using the importprivkey command - and secure the private keys using the bitcoin-qt password (this will also mean that you see transactions on blockchain.info and bitcoin-qt at the same time, which I find quite useful)

the pool can quickly verify that the blockheader hashes to this - and counts this towards the miner's credits
this why you often see on miner display:

blockchain.info is secure enough as long as you have a very long password.  You can also double encrypt with a second password, and then add two factor on top (although two factor doesn't protect blockchain.info being compromised)

Q. So even at the very low end you don't see that there is going to be a place for anonyumous transactions executed online, people just buying things on the internet without having their name attached to it?
A. Without any sort of way to track where it came from, I think that's going to be very difficult. There may be a limit on it, but it's against the trend of anything taking place in the last 10-20 years.  It may be as long as you can track it some way, you can use this system, but somewhere along the line the government has to be able to track it through and see who the originator of this transaction is.
No place for anonymous transactions?  Does that mean no more cash transactions?  This is sort of crazy what this lady is saying.

Thanks - I would totally agree with this - specifically because of the problem of [Change]( addresses not propogating to blockchain.info.
I would therefore amend my advice that it's safe to have keys in blockchain.info (multiple times, if you want) but should only host them in a single instance of bitcoin-qt - and when spending bitcoins, spend from blockchain.info since it will always return change to existing addresses and not create new ones (unlikes bitcoin-qt).  If you spend from bitcoin-qt then the change address will have to be manually pulled out of bitcoin-qt and into blockchain.info - otherwise your balances will be wrong.
But yes, for a beginner, I recommend just using one wallet until you are more familiar with how bitcoin keys work under the hood.

no they don't report, but they could be asked for records from the tax authorities
the problem is that you could have bought on one exchange, transferred the BTC across, then sold on another exchange, so there would be no reasonable way for the tax authorities to know this, especially if one of those purchases was OTC or was actually from mining.

it's not whether your wallet.dat is online or offline - it's the possession of the private keys contained within - so just as you could spend your bitcoins if you had the private keys, so could an attacker.
Hyptothetical example: you have your wallet.dat offline and you have deleted it from your hard disk, but someone breaks into your house and steals your harddisk, does forensic analysis on it and finds the remnants of your wallet.dat and recovers the private keys and spends the bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-04-04 00:24:47
encrypting a wallet doens't generate a whole load of new addresses, it just encrypts the private keys of your current addresses with the passphrase you pick.
After you encrypt your wallet, backups made before you encrypted your wallet should be destroyed.  If you cannot be sure that you have destroyed all the backups, then you should create a new wallet and then turn encryption on and then send all your bitcoins from your old wallet to your new wallet.
If you change your passphrase it doesn't affect any of the wallet keys, it just changes the key required to decrypt the private keys to your bitcoins.  If you feel that your passphrase has been compromised, and as a result you change your passphrase, you should adopt the same procedure as above - i.e. destroy all backups with old passphrases, or create a new wallet with a new passphrase and send bitcoins to that wallet.
Leaving old unencrypted keys/wallets around is a really easy way to get your bitcoins stolen.

looks like a bug in whatever exchange you used.  Which one was it?

sorry for the crappy image, it's getting dark here - but you can see the CASACIUS (not CASASCIUS) in the background hologram, which makes it a series 1 coin

the transaction will stay in the memory cache of active bitcoin nodes until enough of them restart or empty the transaction because they are out of memory - until then, they will retransmit to other nodes and eventually it'll get into a block.
depending on which client you used to send the transaction, you could try manually rebroadcasting it yourself (bitcoin-qt), or you could just remove the transaction (bitcoin-qt, advanced!) or if you're using blockchain.info, then after I think 36hrs the transaction goes away by itself, and you can try a resend.

Donated $250 - I had emailed them twice about this already, and I just emailed them again to thank them for finally accepting USD via the bitcoin payment system as well as via paypal and credit card processors.  Seemed like a no brainer for me.
