But a bitch ain't one.

I'm in Germany and just use my normal bank account. Any EU one should work (SEPA transfer), although I've only ever bought and not sold.

I've noted a trend of people saying this recently.

What happens if your hardware wallet breaks? How is it better than a password-encypted Electrum wallet and seed?
I'm not trolling, I'm genuinely curious as to whether it's worth getting one for small (less than 1 BTC) holders.

How do you use BTC to make more BTC?
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:23:10
This should be more visible. For most people in the world, including those in China who make up most of the market, Bitcoin has already touched new ATHs in 2017. I'm in the Eurozone and Bitcoin is doing even better than in 2013. Same goes for the UK pound and lots of other currencies.

Can you elaborate why not please? Is it just personal preference or is there something wrong with that site? Thanks!

I'm open to persuasion but you have just said namecoin is better without saying why. Can you give a reason? I know nothing about namecoin.
Edit: phone typo

I actually signed up to my bitcoin exchance (bitcoin.de) back in February but didn't buy any bitcoins because it was so much hassle to get myself verified and setup with a bank account.  Then I forgot about it.  Kicking myself now!
I'm going to hold most of my bitcoin but I also want to actually buy something with it as well for the hell of it, probably a pizza from

Not entirely sure what you mean.  If you mean your bitcoin address, it will be something like 1LQTD5ch8bk1GAuSaFbf3AABBHK8BjL3fg (my bitcoin address).  The other person can use their bitcoin software or site to send you money.
If you mean when people tip like on this subreddit, that's through the bitcointip bot.  [Click here for a quick start guide]( or [look here for the documentation for that](  It's very easy to get started with, you just need to send a PM to the bot (user bitcointip).   Good luck!

Am I doing this right?
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:17:33
Bitcoin-QT is your wallet, or at least the client automatically generates one for you. Poke around to find your address. The synchronizing is a pain but has to be done as far as I know. I don't know which exchange is best, depends where you are. Look at the ones on the sidebar and see which you prefer. You may have to give them an uncomfortable amount of personal information to be able to deposit money - at least I did and I'm now wondering if sending a passport scan was a really stupid thing to do! I don't want to recommend anything as I'm new too and am still waiting to be verified by a company.

Bitcoin.de is fast and well established but have a 0.1 BTC minimum. I've only used Kraken once but found them really good, it was also faster to get verified with them.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:21:16
Good to see more people from here.
I've just done done the same as you, although I don't really regret buying silver - I still have it, it's still beautiful and I still think it is a good store of wealth with an outside chance of a reasonable return.  I've decided to diversify a bit, hence bitcoin and also a little litecoin.  I'm going to keep on buying all of them.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:29:18
That's awful, sorry to hear it. Any idea how it happened? Did they guess your password, put malware on your PC or something else?
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:37:27
That's why I said 'almost' although I guess that by being vague about times ('today's price' and 'the price in a week' could be at any point on the respective days) I could weasel my way out of it!
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:44:12
Thanks for those suggestions, I'll look into them when I get home!
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:36:38
I can say with almost complete confidence that the price in a week will be different from today's.

I've also just started. From what I gather, Bitcoin requires a lot of calculation to be done to execute and verify transactions (working on the blockchain). This process also generates new Bitcoins. It used to be that you could use standard PC components to do this but as the system develops the work becomes harder and you need special computers called ASICs to do the processing for it to be anywhere near cost-effective (normal computers use more in electricity than they can generate in Bitcoin).
As far as I've found the best way to get your hands onto some Bitcoin is to sign up with a reputable exchange and transfer money. I'm just waiting to be verified by my first - it takes awhile.

Thanks for getting back to me. Wouldn't that make namecoin's version of the blockchain huge over time?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:43:19
Thanks, I'll look into that. I'm amazed at how quickly everyone's responded to my obvious noob question, thanks!
@_date: 2013-02-26 07:48:58
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:46:50
I've actually got an account at btc-e but don't want to put any real money there. I've used it to quickly swap litecoins but was sweating!
Do you know of any interesting things I can buy in Germany beyond pizza etc from lieferservice.de? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:12:09
What's a brainwallet?
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:06:27
Where is this from?
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:49:47
I've heard too many negative comments about btc-e to leave any substantial sums in their system. I've traded bitcoin for litecoin there though but would only do it for small amounts.  I thought I had something with Perfect Money but they have a 300 Euro minimum too.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:09:47
I've used bitcoin.de to buy 0.1 BTC.
