Besides that My coins are as you kids say here often, have been "Goxed"
NO, I never got them out. :(The things I want to do to Krapelis)

You associated holes that keep saying step back from Mt. Gox. Shut the FDA up. How in the hell do I step back from it when all my bitcoins are in there and I can't withdraw them. You little punks.

OK so I have BitcoinQT ran it it was ready to go and Mt. Gox shut down.
And so now I am inviting hackers to come into my personal laptop becaus Bitcoin QT is on it. Not only that it took a day to set itself. 
Is all this worth it? really??? I presfer the greenback.

None. It's all play coins right now.

I wonder if Karp is familiar with the number 893?
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:13:17
I hear so many different opinions on what system to use. I am mind boggled!!!
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:56:46
I don't care what any of you say. If Mt.Gox dies, confidence in bitcoin will be shattered. If other exchanges follow suit, Bitcoin will die. Because who needs it?

I would love to have lunch with him. I would even be willing to treat him to it. This is where I am thinking we should go! What do you think?

Nice translation.
It's not clear without reading the article whether "kanousei" means possibility, likelihood or potential.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:09:32
Wasn't that their job to keep my coins secure? That's what they charged for right?

This is called Sashimi a'la Carpeles
@_date: 2014-02-15 04:46:14
I don’t think they will just sit back and take it do you?

I have coins and money tied up in this POS that they call a company. I'm from Japan born there worked and lived there.Are you familiar with their culture?
If anyone used them that had ties with the Yakuza and was treated that way. Don't you think they might want to straighten him out? 
I guess he feels protected living behind a name like Mt. Gox.
and Magik. LMFAO

I would love to have Mark for lunch.
Here. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 00:09:13
That is stupid
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:12:10
Like I said that's assuming I am a coder. I am not.
I know how to work my computer a little bit and can use Cubase Photoshop, MS Office. That type of thing. I guess Bitcoin is only for people who are coders.
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:59:18
You did it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 10:11:03
Exactly.
