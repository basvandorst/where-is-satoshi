That's why i used quotes.. guess they'd rather stay inside than grant open access to their room.  Valuables and shiz. 
But yeah, the whole "locked inside" is totally clickbait, they just DoS'd the door system.

Think they were "locked inside" simply cause they knew they couldn't get back in if they left.

Word. Very valid point. 
If you have anything worth saving, consider dropping it onto a paper wallet - and simply give them a map to the nearest bitcoin ATM that pays out. 
Granted that won't be 100% of your stash. But it will leave them with something they can cash-in relatively easy. 
Leave a note for how to get the rest of your wallet, maybe it'll possibly spark interest to figure out the technical specs to get that done.

First things first, always backup to off site storage and such. You don't want your house going up in flames and your bitcoin as well.
Offload some to printed or hardware wallets and store them off-site like a deposit box or relatives house. You can add layers upon layers of security really, just depends what you need. 
This goes beyond bitcoins. I store two encrypted drives in offsite locations. They both mirror a "keepsafe" drive I have at my house; family photos, personal documents, important passwords, couple of private keys. I pick them up every 2-3 months to re-image and keep everything fresh. 
Pretty much 99% of scenarios, one of those drives will be available to my family. If your need for availability is higher, encrypt the shit outta them, encrypt them again, and then send them to the cloud. 
If you feel you need more security, just keep adding complexity layers: 
- MultiPart Keys
- distributed chunks
- Incorporate a "dead switch" to send out decryption key
- a two factor method your remaining peeps will be able to access
- bring in a (trusted) third party to handle the key distribution process
- list goes on...
Hope this helps or at least sparks ideas.

You can't, really. 
I mean... you could rig an api to do it for ya, but that's messy... you'd need to store your keys in the code... wait for confirmations... just bad all around.
On a second note, anything offline needs to be posted to the chain before you can sell. Did you see how long it took for confirmations when BCH took off? Panic sells absolutely destroy transaction times. 
Leave what you want to automate in an exchange, keep the rest. Maybe 80/20 or 60/40 split, all depends on your certainty for a dip, and your risk tolerance. 
EDIT: If you are extremely fearful of exchanges, and/or have a significant of crypto, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Spread them coins across multiple exchanges. Will lessen your risk without much downside, besides learning a couple different exchanges.

haven't looked into it myself - but your most likely scenario would be an exploit within the app itself, for example if someone had access to your phone or backups (malware or physical access).
the chance of someone grabbing your keys over wifi is incredibly slim. obviously it depends on the app's encryption techniques as well as your wifi hygiene: don't connect to public places (starbucks, etc.), secure your home network and wifi (new pass, etc.), and do all transactions over the cellular network if you're away from a secure wifi spot
For any mobile wallet, just leave enough BTC in there to actively trade with. 
**Anything not actively traded should be placed in cold storage/paper wallet/hardware wallet/etc.**

This exactly.

Yeah.. I'm sure you know, the general fear is you don't hold the private keys and are not really in control of your coins. More importantly, you don't know the security controls behind their infrastructure and the company has no legal obligation to provide insurance for your valuables. 
If you actively trade, try to spread across multiple exchanges. Worse case scenario, one gets hacked or locked up, you don't lose all your money. 
Stick to Gemini or Coinbase/GDAX for anything related to BTC/ETH/LTC/USD trades. 
Look into Kraken, Bitfinex, or Bittrex for AltCoins. 
Try to keep roughly 25% or less in one specific exchange at a time. 
Of course anything that's not actively traded should be moved off into something else: hardware or personal software wallet.

(8000-7700)/7700 = 0.039 (percent gained)
0.039 * 100 = 3.90 (profit)
Little easier to visualize since everything is posted by percent gain/loss.

too late for the hype train? :)
