@_date: 2017-10-01 22:25:10
What is that? Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:19:28
Thank you. One last thing what is the difference between coin and cash? Even if you trade for the other thing you will still have the same amount right?
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:50:37
Can you explain this to me?
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:36:27

Damn. If you don't mind me asking how much coins have you obtained? Also, is their anything specific things you have been trying to learn besides crypto currency and block chain?
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:02:57
Haha, okay I understand. Thank you for the explanation. Have you been investing in crypto currency?
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:42:46
Understandable. Is their any material you can share? Or anything you think is important to know?
@_date: 2017-10-01 19:35:46
My man you are on top of it I only have 1 Bitcoin as of now. I started researching about crypto currency and block chain about 3 months back. You are definitely right that are going to be one of the few safe haven assets. I was trying to buy a house well. I was going to wait until next year when the market crashes to get a numerous amount of stocks and then go to real estate.
