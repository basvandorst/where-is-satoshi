Can anyone actually find anything about "Hut 8"? I can't find a website or any other mention of this company anywhere except news articles like the one OP linked, and even this reddit thread.

Thanks! Its a brand new S4 running cm11. Coming from a 3 year old evo 4g the S4 is like jesus phone.

Funny you posted this. My father recently passed away, and in going through all his stuff I found a floppy labeled "pics of the kids".
Of course, now I can't find a floppy drive ANYWHERE.

In semi-related news, does anyone know the best method to sell a used car for BTC? Its a popular car (2006 wrx) so I don't think I would have a hard time doing so, just not sure where to start.

I did the same! Really excited to see what my 5 shares do. Being unemployed may be putting a hurt on the amount of investments I can make but I hope I can make it work for me.
Getting dividends for bitcoin mining versus having to invest in mining rigs myself is a genius idea.

Shit, I hate Philly. Can't even find a decent support gig out here

My wife loves the idea of bitcoin and supports me investing in it. I would tell her in a second if we had a large amount.
Unfortunately most of what I had disappeared when Asicminer stock tanked.
