most of the internet infrastructure is reliant of linux most of the software also, and more importantly we are seeing an example of a possible attack that could be used against the bitcoin open source community, you shouldn't assume bitcoin is immune from this kind of attacks.

im against any type of BTC upgrade that could possibly lead to hidden inflation, i think the way for btc to become fungible is trough P2EP , coinjoin into a LN channel and for further privacy do an atomic swap with monero or LTC  and back to btc. channel factories when they get implemented could be set up with a default coinjoin.  
LN should offer amazing privacy when multi path payements.  
Also when schnorr will be implemented coinjoins will become cheaper then normal txn and and will offer revenue to wallets trough coordinator fees so there will be an incentive for everybody to implement them,   
if i had to make the choice i think btc finite supply is a more important feature then its fungibility, in a optimal scenario i would want both but only if its 100% safe.  
i think btc might become fungible without the need to add potentially dangerous features

As a result, every time a person or a corporation runs a smart contract on RSK, 80% of the fuel paid goes to the miners and the remaining 20% to RSK Labs, so we can continue the development of the open source platform.
 
reminder that rsk will make everything cost 20% more and will not have a decentralized bridge, i think its a scam  they raised millions and wanna get also 20% of the btc used in their network not even exchanges take fees so high, as a proud bitcoiner i won't be using rootstock

usa control a small part of all the btc that exist they can try to manipulate it, but other countries will do the same so if usa go short
china will go long (just an example)

this last two dumps where orchestrated to get cheap btc from weak hands, and probably there will be more in the future.
