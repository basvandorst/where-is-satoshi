That is partly true since new equipment was so much better (energy efficient) than equipment just 6 months older.
Now however Bitcoin ASICs have catched up and pretty soon (within 1-2 years), a bitcoin miner will last and compete as long as a Gaming GPU (2-4 years). This will remove the advantage to be close to the ASIC production.

Can't compete with China or any other part of the world where mining at a loss is useful (since it's the only way to exchange unwanted currency to wanted currency).
Mining will always be most useful where the state currency is less desirable.

Not in the same pace as before.

I suspect bitcoins will always (as they probably are today in china) be produced at a loss. Because there will always be some area of the world where there are capital controls, and it's worth exchanging your locked capital to a distributed one at a penalty.

What is the correct fee. What happens if everyone uses that one?

:( it's the highest my Nano HW wallet provides. See the problem... its a escalated chain of always raising the fees for all clients.

This has the highest fee, sent via a Ledger Nano and blockchain states it has very high fee. Still no luck forover 15h

You do realize that if ledger nano increase the fee, some other wallet will be standing there with a too low fee for its users.
