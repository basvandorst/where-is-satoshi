I mean the chart is accurate though..
Thanks for pointing out the mistakes in the article.

Aren’t all lands discovered and known?

Sorry I didn’t mean to offend you.
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:19:02
While I agree that sentiments have no place in the market, why do you think it would make bitcoin drop? I mean doesn’t the sentiment of confidence make people hodl more which makes BTC more valuable?
@_date: 2018-09-19 03:05:59
That's what I was wondering. And yes it is.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:20:52
Quadrigacx seems nice (prices are high though). Problem is BMO does not have Interac Online and it's to 200$ maximum.
It seems to be anormally hard to buy BTCs in Canada...

Well Coinsquare charges 2.5% when you make an E-transfer from your bank account. There is no rewards with that.
@_date: 2018-08-24 22:35:06
That’s my problem right now.. I don’t know when to buy. I feel like BTC will crash under 6k and then I’ll put my money in it.
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:43:09
I understand. It can even goes to the extent of being anonymous would give more value to your bitcoins (or doing business with you) compared to a ’’public’’ profile. 
(If I understand correctly)

@_date: 2018-08-24 22:41:40
That’s why we’ll get a drop soon since we’re at the end of the month and miners will soon unload?
@_date: 2018-08-23 11:42:20
Could you?
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:07:41
And who are those fellas?
@_date: 2018-08-24 23:54:48
Yeah that was stupid I was trying to reassure myself.
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:04:08
Is there a reason why you're not buying from Coinbase? They seem to have the best rate exchange. Am I missing something or their rate are 300$+ under quadrigacx and MyBTC?
e-transfers are my only way out. Is Envision a bank?
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:09:39
Any video, guide? I do have a coinsquare account but that's all. I'm very interested to learn all this but the links provided in the sidebar are not helpful in this matter.
I mean is it bad to trade on this platform as an example? You have to use a website or something to fund your wallet or account (I don't understand the difference) at some point..
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:36:22
I understand that but what’s the ultimate consequence?
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:38:24
Interests are a moral thing to debate. They can be applied to Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2019-03-18 13:08:27
So everything is about cryptographic security. Considering auto-learning AIs are now a thing, is it not a danger to the cryptographic world (and how the current banking system) since we're getting closer everyday to an AI capable of deciphering it? 
@_date: 2019-03-03 17:24:46
On behalf of people who didn't get it: thank you. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 05:57:10
How to generate an adress safely? Never under why people say it's the safest way. I mean.. Since the private key is displayed on your screen, what if you have a virus snitching or something like that? 
@_date: 2019-03-06 19:22:30
It's not "new bitcoin" it's bitcoin's cents
@_date: 2019-11-18 06:43:24
Why not just remove/incapacitate the responsible hardware?
@_date: 2019-08-03 23:46:52
How much revenue/month would it generate? Not considering expenses (internet, electricity etc..)

What if an organization cracks it before a fork, or before the sha256 crack is publicly known. There is a chance it happens even if we don't want to admit it. 
This post is about the most catastrophic scenario. We are all here because we like crypto technologies but let's be real for a second and not let our fears affect the discussions.
@_date: 2019-06-09 10:24:57
What degen country thinks it's the center of the world?
@_date: 2019-12-15 03:51:38
So.. let's say Bitcoin forks. What about the thousands of people who will lose their money? Bitcoin would take a lethal hit from that IMO.
@_date: 2019-12-15 13:54:02
If sha256 is broken, wouldn't it mean several wallets will be stolen?
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:24:51
Also curious about that. My guess would be shortly after the April 1st pump.
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:21:29
Europe is waking up right now. Momentum is coming back. We might go to 7k in the next 24h.
@_date: 2019-12-15 15:17:05
No idea how they would take advantage of it but not only this organisation could quietly steal targeted wallets without spoiling anything (how can you even prove that they cracked it in the first place) but this very organisation could be **any** organisation, not just a military complex (big techs for example).
@_date: 2019-12-13 06:29:50
Don't you pay a fee when they pay via Debit/Credit? Always wondered why business don't encourage people to pay with cash/crypto for a discount considering they are into it.
@_date: 2019-04-13 22:14:33
What's the tulip trust? Also block 9 is pretty early. How many people had bitcoin at that time?
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:01:54


What does he say about that? He forgot the key? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:12:38
Might be the alt-coins being converted after their bullrun? No idea tbh. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:11:29
Is it even possible that reddit doesn't go crazy for a rally? If so then we're doomed. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 06:37:59
The reason why you're not selling your belongings to put more money in crypto. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:17:16
I feel like I'm out of the loop on this one
@_date: 2019-01-01 09:34:01
Lost 50% in 4 months but surprisingly I don't care. I guess I was mentally prepared and aware of the long term dimension of this adventure when I went in. Also seeing it as an investment for understanding and learning about crypto helps.
Finally, the most important thing: memes on this sub can make you endure anything lol
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:09:08
Imagine yourself taking a dump son. Whales do the same thing when they feel too full: they shit on people. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:47:29
I mean you put the "/s" which means you were joking/memeing about this then got suddenly serious.
Won't lie you got me confused. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 05:03:14
I'm curious now about how did you get more than 150k$ if true. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:53:17
If bitcoin goes to 100$ would you risk that money?
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:06:08
Would like to know also
@_date: 2019-05-11 21:38:17
When you know that some people live paycheck to paycheck...
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:05:26
Yep. It won't reach 5000 then dump.
