I don't understand why people are saying it can/cannot be traded. GBTC is going to be traded on the OTC market, presumably on the OTCQX which is available to anyone that can trade OTCs. All I know is that when GBTC is going to be available to the general public the demand is going to be significant since it is the first Bitcoin-related asset that is tradable on major brokerages. When demand is high, prices increase.

This is still uncertain.

On a serious note, substantial growth does not commence until the 1770s, as seen in the graph. The Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in world history as many countries began to adopt modern capitalism (Adam Smith, the father of capitalism, also published The Wealth of the Nations in 1776). My hypothesis is that as economies began to flourish, countries from all over the world, China, Japan, Australia, Europe, began to prosper financially, and with this expansion of newly created wealth, men were able to make more money, thus being able to afford to feed and take care of more children.
Today, the government appropriates a portion of the wealth, which we shall call taxes, to aide low-income families through welfare programs so they don't have to work and they can still have 3,4,5, or 10 children if they please.
EDIT: Downvotes but no compelling arguments?

This chart is a lie! How could there be data from the early 1000s if the Census Bureau did not exist? HA! Checkmate.
