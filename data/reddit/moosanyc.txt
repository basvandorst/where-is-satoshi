I am a moderator at BTC-e and I have spoken with Aleksey (admin and co owner) he is a very nice individual and they understand the concerns with lack of transparency. But they have their reasons and rights to do so, a few changes will be coming to BTC-e in the coming months, great improvements and even admin himself was talking with users today and being very open. This is nothing but a childish attack on a popular exchange.

First you did not post screencaps and secondly you did not contact directly via ticketing system. You are a fool also Language barrier could complicate things don't accuse someone of scamming before you are sure. I've dealt with shitty customers that go straight for a chargeback, let support at least try to fix it first.
