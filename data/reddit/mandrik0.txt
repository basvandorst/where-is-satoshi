Blockchain.info does not control user's private keys, Doug. Never has and never will. Users have complete control over them. The backup seed generated within a Blockchain.info wallet is compatible with other bitcoin wallets such as Mycelium and Trezor.

You can use the 12 word recovery phrase generated by your Blockchain.info wallet in other wallets. I've personally tested this with Mycelium &amp; Trezor - both worked.

Are you trying to use the legacy version of the wallet? We officially phased it out this week, which means you'll have to upgrade your wallet to the latest version. It may take some getting used to, but we think the latest version is a far superior product.

A new address will be generated each time funds are sent to a previously generated address. You can see previous addresses by clicking *Settings*, *Addresses*, *Manage Addresses* to the right of the HD account in question (only one by default), and then click *Used Addresses*. Do you see the addresses here? Did you import private keys into the wallet previously and had funds sent to these?

A warning is displayed in the HD wallet. In the legacy wallet you are asked to confirm the transaction once you press send, and the fee is included on the confirmation screen.

Are you sure you were on Blockchain.info and not a phishing site? I've never seen any type of situation where your password is in plain text as a part of the URL. I even created a new test wallet and filled in the GUID &amp; password within that URL and nothing happens.
If you can recreate this issue and send as much information as possible to our support team via support.blockchain.com this would be helpful. If this is a phishing site posing as blockchain.info then we can work on taking it down.

The original statement made by the blockchainwallet account on reddit was inaccurate, and I've acknowledge it was inaccurate. There wasn't any increase in the amount of traffic &amp; transactions. There was simply a server issue on our end.
I'm not sure how this could be considered lying. An employee made a mistake, we corrected it on Reddit, and the issue has been addressed with the employee.

Because these keys are compromised. The person who swept the funds from the address could easily do this, but it doesn't prove to me that they are the legitimate owner of the funds. They can't go back in time and import the private key into a backup from July 2014.

@_date: 2014-05-21 23:23:46
I finally got a chance to play around with this, and the device is amazing. After generating a 24-word seed, as well as creating a PIN, I sent 0.05 btc to my Trezor. I then did a test send, and was prompted for my PIN. The pin entry is smart. The Trezor shows the numbers randomly in a 3x3 box pattern, and the computer screen shows the same pattern with the numbers replaced with "?". You have to enter your PIN on the computer in the matching pattern on the device. The number pattern changes each time, too. Once you do that &amp; click Send on the computer, you're asked on your Trezor if you want to send. You're prompted to do this twice. Only then are the funds actually sent.
Next I wiped my Trezor. I wanted to test the seed recovery system, and this was the most brilliant part. You have to enter your PIN, and then the Trezor itself prompts you to enter one random word from your recovery seed &amp; a random word not from your seed. Example:
Enter Word 11 from seed
Enter the word triumph
Enter Word 2 from seed
Enter 21 from seed
Enter the word cardinal
It goes through that process until you've eventually entered every single word from your seed. This is done to prevent a key logger from knowing which words are words in your seed, and what order the words are supposed to be in. Very, very cool.

This is legitimate, as I am the handling the refunds for these issues. Because anyone could submit a claim for an address the only way we can be 100% sure the address was in your wallet is if we decrypt the backups we store. This requires the identifier &amp; password. If someone created a wallet today and imported an impacted private key then I would see that. That would be proof that their claim wasn't legitimate. If they had the impacted address in their wallet since June 2013 then it's 100% clear to me that the funds are theirs. I wish there was another way to properly do this, but there isn't. I need to be able to decrypt the backups to investigate each claim.
With that said the wallet should first be emptied and the password should *never* be used again. Even if it was sent to me via PGP I would say the exact same thing. I don't want to be the only other person who knows your password &amp; private keys.

I've been involved with two different bitcoin companies since early 2013 (first BitInstant and now Blockchain.info), and I started accepting bitcoin for my now defunct baklava business back in late 2011. When you work in the industry you have a completely different outlook on things. I got involved because I believe bitcoin is the future of money. I don't know if $100,000/btc is part of that future, but that isn't my focus. Bitcoin was fun when it was valued at a couple bucks, and it's still fun today. There is so much ahead of us as a community, and I look forward to being a part of that in whatever way possible.

My income has been 100% bitcoin for over a year now. I still have to convert some to fiat to pay some bills, but it's less and less every month. It seems like every week there are more and more ways for me to spend my bitcoins on things I use daily. Bitcoin is the superior way to do business with other individuals from anywhere in the world, and possibly making a profit is only a byproduct for me. It's not the focus.
As someone who has worked in the industry for over a year I can assure you no one stops working on their bitcoin-related ideas when the price tanks. Entrepreneurs continue to bring these ideas to life regardless of the market price. Price goes up, price goes down. I'll still use bitcoin every day.

I completely understand where you are coming from, and I'm not the kind of guy who wants to be asking users for passwords. Plaintext or not, sending a password for me to see is one extra person too many. The user could generate a new address in this wallet and then proceed to archive/delete all of the other addresses within the wallet. No one logging in with the identifier + password would ever know what took place in that wallet.
Example - I have this wallet, identifier 13b30eee-ab71-4c2f-a3f5-7d99bea8c0d2. This wallet has been used to send and receive bitcoin at one time. Before posting here I generated a new address, 1F4BE59nW6gPqdXJ8Zt4fMydvUM21ej7QX, and then archived/deleted the other addresses. When you log in you won't see any history of this wallet, except the one address in there with no transactions.
login:  
pw: pjAiDV
The only way you can tell the history of this wallet is by decrypting older backups. Now everyone who reads this knows the identifier + pw I used, but I'll never use pjAiDV as a password again.

There are a lot of different ones if you search online. I like a 5x5 (10 piece) bacon weave. Don't buy thick cut bacon, either. Stick with 18/22. I first tried this three years ago, but it's something that takes time to master. Every strip of bacon is unique, but there are similar cuts that you learn to use to make the perfect weave. I like a nice, tightly weaved blanket of bacon. I tend to bake them for around 12-15 minutes each so that it's about 3/4 of the way done. Then I allow the weave to drain on some paper towels. Once it's cooled off you can wrap &amp; freeze it to reuse later.
To make a bacon weave omelet you just put the frozen bacon weave in a skillet and heat it up. Once it starts to sizzle pour 3 scrambled eggs overtop. Let that cook, and then flip so the other side can cook. I'd put the temperature a little lower than normal so it doesn't burn on the outside. It can take a while to cook the egg the entire way through.

I've met OP a few times in real life. I'm glad I was able to help in any way that I could, but obviously there isn't much Blockchain.info can do when dealing with lost passwords. OP &amp; I spent a few months just trying to locate the correct wallet so he could get the encrypted backup for it.
I'm happy you got your bitcoins back! :)

I've been using Coin for Coffee since it came out, and I've had fast &amp; slow experiences. Overall it's worked relatively quickly most of the time, and I was able to have the barcode ready for payment within a minute tops. Love these guys &amp; love that they hook us up with Starbucks. :)

I finally got a chance to play around with this, and the device is amazing. After generating a 24-word seed, as well as creating a PIN, I sent 0.05 btc to my Trezor. I then did a test send, and was prompted for my PIN. The pin entry is smart. The Trezor shows the numbers randomly in a 3x3 box pattern, and the computer screen shows the same pattern with the numbers replaced with "?". You have to enter your PIN on the computer in the matching pattern on the device. The number pattern changes each time, too. Once you do that &amp; click Send on the computer, you're asked on your Trezor if you want to send. You're prompted to do this twice. Only then are the funds actually sent. Next I wiped my Trezor. I wanted to test the seed recovery system, and this was the most brilliant part. You have to enter your PIN, and then the Trezor itself prompts you to enter one random word from your recovery seed &amp; a random word not from your seed. Example:
Enter Word 11 from seed
Enter the word triumph
Enter Word 2 from seed
Enter 21 from seed
Enter the word cardinal
It goes through that process until you've eventually entered every single word from your seed. This is done to prevent a key logger from knowing which words are words in your seed, and what order the words are supposed to be in. Very, very cool.

I used this site yesterday to buy a round at Starbucks for some family members. It works great!

I think the problem is with checking out. When the cashier at Walmart scans the barcode it doesn't work. The cashier has to enter it manually and then get approval from a floor manager. This requires them to re-enter the card number. The entire process is a huge hassle, as it happened 4 times for me at Sam's and Walmart. I had to just go to the customer service desk and buy a physical gift card with my virtual one. 
Meanwhile at Target - you pull up the Gyft app, they scan the barcode, and you're done faster than a CC payment.

In 2012 I decided I wanted my income to be 100% bitcoin, and I started to work towards that. By early 2013 I had reached this point, and I'm coming up on two years of living on a bitcoin salary. I do as much as possible with bitcoin, but I still liquidate when I have to. It's not as impractical as you may think, but I wouldn't recommend it if you can't keep emotion out when the price swings up or down.

Thanks! I have 20lbs of bacon in my freezer right now, and plan to weave most of it some time soon. There is no better way to start your morning off than with a bacon weave omelet. We've all had bacon and eggs before, but it doesn't compare to the weave omelet. There's something about how the egg cooks around the bacon weave that makes it taste amazing. Every bite is perfect. No wonder we'd sell so many of them!
BTW, I've weaved over 500lbs of bacon, which is probably more than any other human on this planet. It's fun!

I've been with Blockchain.info since September, but I also spent a few months with BitInstant in early 2013. I've been getting paid 100% in bitcoin since then, and it's great. You're always trying to find ways to pay for everything you need without having to convert to dollars. I love it!
@_date: 2014-04-14 16:42:07
It absolutely works. The only thing I would advise is to complete the checkout process on your phone before going up to order. It'll take about 20-30 seconds for the barcode to appear, but once it's up on your phone you have about 30 minutes to use it at the register. It went through instantly, and I had my bitcoin change back within seconds of requesting it.

I've been living on bitcoin for a while now. You get to go on so many adventures from figuring out the best way to get everything you need through bitcoin, to meeting new/interesting people on Local Bitcoins when you occasionally need fiat.

@_date: 2014-03-03 02:16:59
I started accepting bitcoin back in late 2011 on my website, mandrik.com (George's Famous Baklava). I was living in New Hampshire accepting bitcoin for personal chef work, house cleaning, and my food stand at the Porcupine Freedom Festival. In late 2012 I decided I wanted to go 100% bitcoin, and by early 2013 I had the chance. I was hired by BitInstant, and spent a few months there.
In August I was given the opportunity to work for Blockchain.info, and I'm so glad I joined the team. Bitcoin isn't just a hobby for me. It's something I am extremely passionate about, and I feel very fortunate to be working alongside others who feel the same way. My wife, Alyson, was also brought on to the team to manage all aspects of social media, including our blog. It's starting to feel "normal" to have a household that is living on bitcoin 100%, but it's not always easy. There are definitely challenges when it comes to living off bitcoin full time. At this point we wouldn't have it any other way.
I love this community! Every opportunity I've had to travel with Alyson and others on the Blockchain.info crew has been unique and eye opening. There are so many bitcoin DOERS spread out around the world who are bringing their ideas to life. I want to be a part of that.
I spent ten years with Comcast in a safe, comfortable, and boring job. I could never go back to what's considered normal after this! :)
@_date: 2016-03-10 04:07:41
I'm not as convinced as some of my co-workers that we need to switch to bigger blocks ASAP, and I agree - some wallets need to be handling fees better. Blockchain.info has been working on dynamic fees prior to last week, and we wanted to make sure this feature was safely implemented. It's now live in our HD wallet (I sent a few test transactions today that were all sent with less than 0.0001 btc fees, and all confirmed in the next block). BC.I makes up a large amount of the network's transactions, so it will be interesting to see what type of impact this will have the next time there are a large number of transactions in the mempool.

Without looking at this specific issue in our ticketing system I'm fairly certain that all we (Blockchain.info) needed to do was locate his wallet identifier for him. He was then able to use his password to log in from his computer. The problem was his phone app was no longer paired to his wallet. I've seen this happen before, and the solution is to log into the wallet from our website, and then re-pair the wallet to your phone. This doesn't require us to gain access to the contents of a wallet.

I spent a few months working with BitInstant back in early to mid 2013. I worked remotely, but I was in NYC the week of the $266 crash. When Gox initially went down we couldn't do a damn thing to get people their bitcoins, and the angry emails from customers were piling up. Charlie kept trying to get a hold of Mark. Mark wouldn't answer calls or respond on IRC, so Charlie starts yelling, "I need a flight to Japan now!" Charlie spent the next hour trying to figure out all the logistics of flights, arrival time, etc. I think he was a minute away from booking everything when Mark finally got a hold of him.

I also use Mycelium, Trezor, Ledger, and have used pretty much every other wallet out there. I'm a bitcoiner before all else, so I always like to check out other wallets.
Issues in the past have been dealt with, and we continue to work on creating a better wallet. A lot of bitcoin companies have come and gone, but we're still in this space. We're not looking to pivot away from bitcoin the first chance we get. I've seen this company grow from a couple full timers, myself included, to a team of 30+.

For the record Roger didn't open the guy's wallet. Blockchain.info can't do that since the pw is required (only the user has this).

If you are using the new beta wallet then you can backup your wallet via the security center. Once you have the backup phrase recorded you never need to back up the wallet again. Keep in mind this phrase will not back up any imported private keys. These private keys would need to be backed up manually.
If you are using the legacy wallet then you would want to back it up every time you create a new address. 
Edit - not really sure why this would be downvoted, as I've factually answered the questions OP had.

I've never hidden the fact that I work for Blockchain.info. Roger has invested in a lot of Bitcoin companies.

That covers a lot of people who hold a wide range of opinions on bitcoin. 
I've been a somewhat vocal supporter of segwit (I say somewhat because I'm not a developer so I don't think my opinion on the topic matters much). Guess what? He's OK with that. People can be friends and not agree 100% with each other. It's a part of life.

I think there are well intentioned, super smart people on both sides of this debate. I have a specialized set of skills with 4+ years of user ops experience in the bitcoin world, but I'm not a developer. My opinion may not matter, but I'm still going to form one. :P
I hate seeing people on both sides demonized. I'd prefer if bitcoiners would focus more on the actual code and less on the individuals who write it.

Supposedly they were waiting for v4 launch before adding segwit support. Dude, I have no clue why it still hasn't happen. I left because of the segwit2x shenanigans + rollout for shitcoins like bcash. Even so I can tell you that Roger has no say in day to day operations there. It's a claim not backed by facts. The reason probably has something to do with the CEO.

Not yet! The hardware is in place in newer models (since around Sept 2016) and they've done tests with this. You can see the test here:
Cars with v2 AutoPilot hardware have begun to receive updates, but they are not autonomous for owners yet:
I think the real battle will be the legislative one to allow these cars to operate autonomously.

Former Blockchain.com employee here - Roger invested in every early bitcoin company but that doesn't mean he owns &amp; runs them all. I left in January this year-I think the last time I saw Roger involved with the company in any day to day stuff was maybe early 2015, but probably not since late 2014.
Whatever the reason for the lack of segwit support I doubt it has anything to do with Roger.

Have you thought about having this graded and encapsulated by ANACS? I did that with a series 1 Casascius coin (the one with the error in the hologram). I sent mine through the mail, but I'd seriously consider going to their location in CO if I had this 1k btc gold coin.

"From the perspective of a user who needs a reliable site for important monetary purposes, the relative difficulty of fixing BlockchainInfo platform bugs is irrelevant."
Which is why I usually wouldn't comment, but you saying "refuse to fix" is absolutely wrong. I wanted to make that clear, but I'd rather we fix the issues and let our uptime speak for us.
The wallet is an HD wallet now. You can import the Blockchain.info wallet seed into a Trezor or Mycelium and it will work. If you have an old wallet.aes.json backup from the v2 wallet then you can decrypt it offline via this tool - 
It sounds to me like you don't know as much about the wallet as you think you do. There were other times in the past when I had to correct your false statements. 
"Privacy issues also persist, with CEO Peter Smith making statements that the unnecessarily privacy invasive practices that Roger Ver abused are still present, behind the closed source of the Blockchain server."

I'm the r/btc mod that removed the post because Reddit admins have made it clear that linking to that specific ProHashing thread is considered doxxing. I explained it to Roger after I removed the post and he understood.
I don't care who posts something on r/btc that goes against the rules. I'm going to moderate appropriately. As far as I'm aware Roger &amp; the rest of the mod team is 100% fine with that. If that was an issue then I would remove myself as a mod.

The wallet password is used to log into the wallet. It's what's needed to decrypt the actual wallet, and without it the funds are essentially lost. Blockchain.info never has access to user passwords so don't forget it! That said, if you do forget it you can recover the funds with the 12 word recovery phrase.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:30:01

Blockchain.info is a noncustodial HD wallet. Wallets can be backed up, and the backup phrase can be used across other wallets like Mycelium &amp; Trezor. BCI doesn't know your phrase or your passwords. If this information is lost then the funds associated with a wallet are essentially lost forever.

The issue with the site falling behind in blocks is the same issue that happened today. We know what the problem is and we have a solution in place. It's not a quick fix.
The unconfirmed tx priority status will be removed in a future update. It used to be helpful, but I agree, it's useless now.
The isolated cryptography issues that impacted only a small percentage of users in the past were from a time when the team was much smaller. There hasn't been a single issue this year since we updated to HD wallets for users. I believe the last time this was even an issue was in early 2015 on an older version of the Android wallet, and that impacted a very tiny amount of people.
@_date: 2016-11-20 03:58:47
Well said +1 for segwit support.
@_date: 2016-12-14 18:05:05
Roger has been a huge boon to bitcoin, and we should not forget that. So much of the world found out about bitcoin through Roger. Bitcoin, along with the voluntaryist ideology, is his life and he wants nothing more than for it to succeed. He's also an emotional guy, and you can hear that in his responses throughout this debate (and in other interviews/documentaries). I truly do not believe he is a malicious person, or that he is just trying to get rich(er) off of bitcoin. If you know Roger you know this isn't what drives him.
You can disagree with his viewpoints, but at the same time you should try to acknowledge the positive impact he's had on this space. Many of the folks in this interview/debate did. The only way we can make this thing happen is by working together, even when we may not agree with each other.
@_date: 2016-12-08 16:23:18
Done. I see rate limits as a form of censorship, so there's no reason not to add users to the approved list. If someone is a terrible troll then just ban them and be done with it.

Players can create their own missions, and Niantic (Google) almost always approves them. You upload an image to go with the mission, and when the mission is complete the player earns that mission's badge. As you can see from this screenshot I've completed 7 Dorian-themed missions.

I'm a bitcoiner first and foremost, and it saddens me when I read about bitcoin companies closing shop. The most recent news from Armory is a great example of this. What all of us in this space are trying to accomplish isn't easy, but we work at it every day.

I'm really sorry to hear about this. It sounds like someone gained access to your email address, wallet identifier, and password, assuming you were seeing email notifications of someone trying to log in while you weren't logging into your wallet. If you were using the same password for multiple websites then you should check on these as well. You could be at even greater risk otherwise.
To clarify a few points made by other commenters - Blockchain.info has grown a lot over the past few years. We’ve been listening to the global bitcoin community and making improvements. In fact, we’ve built a new HD wallet from the ground up that will be more secure and easier to use than ever before. The web version is here,  iOS and Android versions have also been released this week.

I think this applies to a world with fully autonomous vehicles. The first benefit would be for families who own multiple vehicles. A self driving car could take two people to work in the morning, then take itself home and charge until it needs to be used again. Friends or family who work opposite shifts could share a car this way, too.
You would start to see braver individuals sending their cars out to act as self driving taxis during times when the vehicle would normally be sitting at home or in an office parking lot. It sounds crazy to let strangers in your car, but I imagine some type of a rating system would be included within the software/app the owners and riders would use. You could even setup cameras in and around your car so you can monitor &amp; record activity while your car is out making you money (bitcoin!).
As a Model 3 reservation holder I wouldn't want to be one of the first to test this out as level 4 autonomation becomes a reality in this world, but that could change as the technology improves. It's exciting to think about these possibilities becoming reality in the very near future.

I've worked with Blockchain.info since 2013 and have used the wallet since 2012. There was never a one-click login function. Password was always needed to decrypt the wallet backup. There were aliases, which were used instead of the long alpha-numeric wallet identifier. That made logging in easier, but you still needed the pw to decrypt the wallet.

If you have a number of imported addresses, then you can sweep them using the "Transfer All" function. 
Select "Addresses" from the "Settings" section of your wallet. To the right of "Imported Addresses" you will see a blue button that says "Transfer All." Press this and you will be brought to a transaction screen. From here you'll be able to select which part of your wallet you'd like to move your funds to. The default is the main account. Please note that the higher the number of imported addresses you are sending from, and the more inputs contained at each address, the higher the fee will be.

If you have an older version of the Blockchain wallet (prior to the HD version), then you would have a wallet.aes.json backup file. You can recover private keys from this file via this offline decryption tool:
If you have the 12-word backup, which is the seed associated with the HD wallet, then you can use it in any other BIP39/44 wallet. I know Mycelium &amp; Trezor both work.

Wanted to add that if at any point you changed your pw a new mnemonic would have been generated. So if you wrote down the original one, changed the pw, and didn't write down the new mnemonic, then you'll only be able to recover the old (and likely useless) password.

Hey there. Blockchain.info doesn't have any type of buy/sell/trade section within our wallet. Did you send an unencrypted backup to this other user? If so then they would have swept the keys and stolen the funds. It sounds like this address is compromised, so I would strongly encourage you to never use it again. Any funds sent to it at any time would be stolen immediately.

Sounds like they would have had access to the private keys. The transaction wasn't actually sent from a Blockchain.info wallet. It didn't use BIP69, which our wallet implements for all transactions.
@_date: 2015-10-03 00:19:24
I'm the Blockchain.info User Operations Manager who has been working with OP on this. He references these links in a later post, but our team tracked these down:
The address in question has a strange history. The private key was exposed at one point, so many different people likely have control of it. There isn't any indication that this address was originally generated in a Blockchain.info wallet two years ago. If it wasn't then that rules out a software issue. I'm thinking OP imported this private key into his wallet.

@_date: 2017-05-16 23:34:51
All fine now.
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:28:01
Completely false. Blockchain.info wallets are not custodial. 
@_date: 2016-05-05 21:03:06
Great question!
The big drop in transactions happened when we shut down receive payments v1, and around that same time one of our largest users migrated to an in-house solution. Receive payments v1 would generate addresses controlled by BCI, and the funds would eventually forward to the API user. Receive payments v2 no longer operates in this manner. These API users supply an xPub, and their funds are forwarded directly to these addresses. As a result of this the overall transaction volume has dropped. Please note that RP v2 transactions are not tracked on this chart.
We've seen an incredible amount of positive feedback from our RP v2 users. I've been a part of the BCI support team for over 2.5 years and this change has been one of my favorites. It operates better and faster than v1, and at no point does BCI touch user funds.

Blockchain.info is non-custodial. The backup seed works with other wallets like Mycelium and Trezor. Best thing to do if you're worried is to not send any funds during a potential fork period.

We do respond in record time when users open tickets. We've averaged a 2.5 hour or less first response time for many years now. It's not easy, but my team is pretty hardcore.

Blockchain.info is non-custodial. So yes, you have your private keys. You should probably do a bit more research before making claims like this. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:29:09
I was a bitcoiner before a BCI employee so I understand why other old timers on r/Bitcoin don't recommend the BCI wallet. Please understand that 95% of our current team, including developers &amp; our QA team, wasn't around back then. It's not the same product from 2014 or 2015. We got a ton of attention from the Series B raise (the news barely made a dent on the front page of this subreddit). To me, this is the most likely reason why reviews went up. Saying we bought reviews during the precise moment we got a ton of organic attention makes less sense.
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:01:11
We received a lot of attention with the recent news of our Series B raise. That translated into wallet installs which inevitably led to more reviews.

I know communicating with Blockchain.info was difficult in the past, but that isn't the case any more. We want to reply to all tickets within 24-48 hours tops, but lately it's been more like 6-12 hours. 
We can reply to your ticket, unless you prefer a different form of communication. Thanks again for the heads up!

It didn't even make sense when I said it in context.
@_date: 2013-10-12 16:49:40
It really is as simple as Ben states it - there was internal confusion about a procedure. We've made things right in this situation, and we're going forward with a better understanding of how to take care of issues like this in the future.
@_date: 2013-10-27 03:47:06
Always always always 2FA. I've worked with Blockchain.info for a couple months now, and I've seen exactly zero tickets from users who had their funds stolen from an account with Google Authenticator or a Yubikey. 
@_date: 2013-09-28 14:42:36
Bliss, can you open a ticket with Blockchain? I can assist you further that way:

Check your PMs!

It's actually George's Famous Baklava, and I accept bitcoins @ mandrik.com. =D

How the hell does China have Goats for Bitcoin, but the US doesn't? No fair. :(
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:09:51
If you ordered before I shut the site down, then I already shipped your order. You should get it very soon! :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:42:23
Done &amp; thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:43:36
Pay attention to Montreal, bitcoin world!
@_date: 2013-10-17 13:53:00
I purchased a card last night from eGifter. I just went to Walmart, purchased a physical card using my ecard (you can do this at a normal register), and then bought gas from the Sam's Club next door. It works!
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:05:06
Wow, thanks so much! I really appreciate the kind words, and the generous tip! :D
@_date: 2013-10-11 11:45:25
If you want a special order that's extra thick, then I can certainly accommodate. I can work with any type of special order so long as the customer buys the entire pan. Just email/message me and we can work something out. :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:06:51
In the future can you please submit a ticket via blockchain.zendesk.com? I answer all of them within hours of submission. You made this post shortly after I went to bed last night, or I'd have contacted you right away.
You can test it out. Submit a ticket to say hi or something. I promise I'll respond! :) Blockchain.info isn't messing around with support, and I will do everything I can to help anyone who has an issue.
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:23:13
This place rocks. If you're anywhere close to Montreal, then I'd encourage you to visit. The bitcoin community there is an amazing group of people!
@_date: 2013-10-11 01:00:25
Glad you enjoyed it, and thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 17:17:14
I hear that baklava is pretty tasty stuff. ;)
@_date: 2013-12-23 01:25:33
I don't think it's possible to be any more legit than bitcoinstore.com. ;)
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:57:29
Wow, there are some really cool looking games on here! I just checked out Airscape, but I want to give some others a shot when I have more time. :) Thanks for accepting bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-09-26 02:37:34
This is something I want to discuss with the team, and I'm sure we'll have more info on this very soon.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:41:13
Oh shit, Curtis, you got me! :D
@_date: 2013-10-23 23:14:03
Please report that link as a phishing site -  I've had a lot of Blockchain.info users do the same. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:18:42
Check your PMs. :)
@_date: 2013-10-18 02:08:26
You can add the card right back into your egifter wallet, though. Just manually enter the card number &amp; pin. Then you can just leave the physical card in your car for gas (or wherever), and use your smart phone for store purchases.
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:49:21
No problem at all
@_date: 2013-09-27 21:09:13
Hey, UmphJunk, can you open a ticket here?
I can definitely assist you with this question. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-17 18:05:48
If you sent the funds within 8 hours of creating the address, then they will  reach the destination account. Sorry if this is taking longer than anticipated!
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:09:45
Amanda rocks!
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:36:54
Which means you can use these at Sam's Club - gas with bitcoin!
Walmart eGift Cards can be used at:
Any Walmart store
You must have a copy of your eGift Card email to use in a Walmart or Sam’s Club* store during checkout.
To use at a Walmart Gas Station: print the eGift Card and trade it in for a plastic gift card at any Walmart Store.
@_date: 2013-10-24 03:46:55
I'd like to take all the credit...but I didn't do anything (other than write that post). :)
Thanks for the update!
@_date: 2013-09-19 23:22:30
Please do it via a new ticket. It's easier to keep track of everything within the ticketing system. You can even mention this reddit post. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:43:00
Any killer offers for the first person to buy a car in btc? I bet you'd get a ton of press if you had a btc sale on Monday! :D
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:50:53
Maybe one day. :b
@_date: 2013-10-17 19:19:14
I picked one up last night. This morning I used the ecard to purchase a physical card in store, and then used it to gas my car up at Sam's Club. :)
@_date: 2013-09-20 17:32:55
I'm sure the OP can post a reply himself, but this issue has since been resolved. Thanks, everyone!
@_date: 2013-10-16 14:38:58
I ship priority mail from New Hampshire, so it'll probably take 2-3 business days to arrive. I only ship on Mon-Wed so packages don't spend an extra day en route to destination.
I could make this SUPER THICK by essentially using two normal pans worth of baklava ingredients. Double the nuts, syrup, and fillo. Damn, I bet that would look awesome. :D
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:09:34
Thanks! :) Glad you liked it! 
@_date: 2013-09-27 16:09:10
If this was related to a security flaw I would have definitely seen a flood of tickets related to this issue, but that wasn't the case this morning. Regardless, I always recommend the following:
1. Don't use an alias, or make it extremely complicated (sounds like you have this covered).
2. If you receive this message change or remove your alias.
3. Create an entirely new wallet and move your funds there if you feel there is a security risk with your current account.
4. Use two factor authentication. I HIGHLY recommend you use something like Google Authenticator or a Yubikey.
Obviously this can happen if someone is trying to brute force logins. It looks like it happened to a few people here based on responses. I certainly appreciate the heads up!

Now to relocate to Afghanistan &amp; offer heroin baklava.
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:42:07
I just used it to advertise my baklava business. :D
"Tired of donut-eating stereotypes? Buy baklava w/ btc @ mandrik.com!"
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:36:35
Good point. If you want to bid, but have the same problem, I will put a bid in for you, w/ a link to your Reddit post. Which auction did you want to bid on?

“We will download the Bitcoin and store them." When asked where they would sell the bitcoins, the spokesperson said, "We will download the Google to find the best place."
@_date: 2013-10-10 23:23:12
I love love love when my baklava business (mandrik.com) is mentioned in the same sentence as heroin. YES!
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:30:13
I did look into this briefly, but I'm actually in a meeting right now. As soon as this is done I'm going to look into this further, and then get back to you. I'm sure we can get to the bottom of this. :)
@_date: 2013-11-16 01:06:39
From Brainless Tales. Great comic!
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:23:36
The tip &amp; the feedback is greatly appreciated! I'm sorry you didn't initially get a response when you emailed Blockchain.info back in the summer. We've made a lot of changes since then and stay on top of issues now. It's always great to help reunite people with their moneys! ;)
@_date: 2013-10-23 23:26:01
I'd strongly encourage you to make a new wallet with a new identifier, and never use a compromised one again. 2FA is always encouraged, especially with a Yubikey or Google Authenticator.
@_date: 2013-12-08 04:02:33
Let me know! I'm thinking about buying a new car, and I live in NH. ;)
@_date: 2013-09-26 02:49:36
I certainly don't want to make any excuses for the way communication was handled in the past. Yes, six months ago it took a lot longer to get a response. I started working with Blockchain about 2.5 weeks ago, and I'm making sure things are different going forward.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:49:18
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:48:20
Blockchain.info support here. Shared sends can take a little bit if time to go through, but your funds are safe with us. You can open a support ticket (blockchain.zendesk.com) with the address you sent from &amp; the shared address you sent the funds to if you want me to keep an eye on the transaction.
We will soon be launching a faster, more efficient shared send service called Sharedcoin. You can read more about it here -  The tests I've done were all instantaneous!
@_date: 2013-10-12 15:16:30
I just replied to his ticket. Sorry to see these funds were stolen! It's so frustrating to have something like that happen when you're mostly just trying to spread interest in bitcoin. It sounds like you did everything you could do after the fact, especially covering things like 2FA and strong passwords.
@_date: 2013-10-27 15:05:15
Just go to "Account Settings" after you log in, click on "General," and then you should see "Automatic Email Backups" at the bottom of the page. Just uncheck the box and you're all set!
@_date: 2013-09-19 23:20:24
I actually went through all the previously unanswered tickets and informed folks that we are responding to new tickets within 24-48 hours. I'm sorry it was more difficult to communicate with blockchain.info in the past, but that won't be the case going forward.
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:18:56
I laughed. :) 
Actually, I'm dedicating more of my time to bitcoin! That's why I closed up shop. I've been working for Blockchain.info since August, and I just need to focus on that now.
@_date: 2013-09-19 23:26:54
Thanks! I'm not just some random customer service guy either. I've been involved with bitcoin for many years, and I found out about it through the NH liberty movement. I've actually cooked at the Porcupine Freedom Festival the last four years, and am known for my bacon weaves &amp; baklava (not combined :b). So I take this job seriously.
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:05:59

Yesterday afternoon/evening, my gf &amp; did a whole bunch of stuff using bitcoins. First we went to Sam's Club, where I filled up my gas tank, and then purchased a bunch of groceries. Then we hit up Old Navy for some clothing (we both needed some winter clothing). We ended the night by going to see Bad Grandpa, which was a lot of fun!
All of this was done using gift cards we bought with bitcoins. I'd like to just use the bitcoins at these businesses, but this is a start!
@_date: 2013-10-11 20:31:59
I do work for Blockchain.info, and we're doing everything we can to make customer support a strong point for us. I've been with Blockchain.info a little over a month, and what enmaku says is true - there were a very large number of backlogged tickets when I came on. I  sent out a mass message to the older ones, and I asked users to open a new ticket if their issue was ongoing. I also wanted to reassure users that, moving forward, we would be answering tickets in a reasonable amount of time. Since then I've been clearing out the queue at least 4-5 times a day. I'd like to think we're making improvements, but I'll leave that to the users to decide.
Blockchain.info isn't just another job for me. I joined because I love what Ben has worked hard to create, and I want to see it grow. I couldn't believe he maintained such an amazing site for so long with little to no help. I'm sorry this issue remained unresolved after all this time, and Ben has since taken care of it. We're going to learn from this experience, and correct whatever needs corrected. The focus right now is on improving the site and the support, and that's what we'll continue to do every day.
@_date: 2013-09-17 01:21:01
Just wanted to let you know that I saw your ticket, and I just replied . Please keep all correspondence there for privacy issues. :) Thanks!

You can retrieve your wallet identifier at  or you can try accessing your account at  Let me know if that works for you.
@_date: 2013-09-19 23:52:43
Yup, I replied to it. I opened a ticket internally, too, to keep track of everything.
