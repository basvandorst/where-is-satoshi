The [Glacier Protocol]( while possibly overkill (depending on how much Bitcoin you're talking about), includes some good discussion about using multi-sig wallets for this purpose. (Skim both the [design]( and [protocol]( documents.) 
Rather than splitting a single seed phrase between multiple locations, you can create individual private keys and choose the number required to successfully sign a transaction. For example, you can require three of five keys, and distribute one each to:
* yourself
* your wife
* a safe deposit box
* your attorney
* a trusted third party who will become executor of your estate if you and your wife die essentially simultaneously
Obviously, this is for secure storage of a large amount of Bitcoin, not a smaller amount used in frequent transactions. Normally, if you want to move assets, you and your wife open up the safe deposit box and, using all three sets of keys, you sign a transaction. If you die, your wife can use the paper wallet in the safe deposit box and a third key from either your attorney or the trusted third party. If you both die, your lawyer and your executor should be able to gain access to your safe deposit box to sign a transaction. 
Obviously, you must tailor this to your individual situation. If you think your wife might grab the paper wallet from the safe deposit box and run off with either your attorney or your friend, well then you're gonna need a different setup.
