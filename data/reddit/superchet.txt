Max Keiser comes off very poorly in this video.  He's not a good ambassador.

I value Joe Rogan's opinion on:
MMA?  Yes
Scary Things?  Yes
Bitcoin?  No

Scammers.  The following is from:  
Stansberry &amp; Associates, an investment research firm catering to right-wing audiences' fears of President Barack Obama, has been fined $1.5 million for engaging in "deliberate fraud" and profiting from "false statements." Despite its shoddy history, numerous conservative outlets and personalities including Newt Gingrich, Fox Business, Glenn Beck, Mike Huckabee, Alex Jones, WND, and The Washington Times, have helped legitimize the firm and its wild investment schemes. The firm has also enlisted the help of former Fox News contributor Dick Morris, who has frequently promoted the firm in sponsored video pitches.

Is $4.5BB in transactions a lot or a little?  Why is that a meaningful metric?  I've worked on Wall Street since '93--GS and ML for the entire time--and phrasing your experience that way is strange to say the least.

And then the tech sector crashed less than two years later.

Any idea who's running the DDOS?

How may bitcoins have been donated so far?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:05:12
It won't matter because it's in USD anyway and not earning any interest.

HFS There's some stupid ITT.  Banks forcing foreclosure on fully paid off houses?  Child please.
These are the same people giving advice on BC.  Be careful who you listen to.

I assume you mean trade on margin?  AFAIK, no one will lend against bitcoin.  It's not possible to margin them.
I'd prefer to have the ability to short them.

This is a short term trade where I am buying additional bitcoins with the goal of selling them immediately.  I am not selling any of my longterm holdings.  The only result, if it works, will be that I end up with more dollars.

Just did it for a small amount.  I had $165 at btc and bought BC then transferred to Mt Gox and sold them for ~$185.
Obviously the numbers would have to be bigger to overcome the transfer fees.

You misread the report:


 coins, max mkt cap implies $714 USD / coin.
He thinks the BTC is ahead of itself.

The bitcoin game is not for the faint of heart.  You need to protect yourself from the thousands of hackers, shysters and all around bad guys who want to steal your coins.  Someone said this is like the Wild West, and it is--both good and bad.
