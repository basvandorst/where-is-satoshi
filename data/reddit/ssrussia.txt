I’m with you, I also bought some bitcoin just before the dip. but if there’s one thing that Reddit thought me is to HODL! Give it some more time, it will hit ATH in no time!

I own a few bitcoins, I also have a few alt coins
Planning to invest into mining shares; that way I’ll be getting some percentage from mining as well.

I’m holding; you’re right, I know if I don’t sell I technically didn’t make any money 
Just makes me feel better if I consider it income. Lol

What are the transaction fees? I’ve used DigitalMint ATM and they charge about 8-10%; depending on amount

Has anyone bought through LocalBitcoins out of state? Like a cash deposit or cash by mail? Is it safe?

Yea, kind of hard to make as much profit when you get In on it when it’s over 4.5K
But I got faith in Bitcoin; be up to 10K in no time at this rate ����
