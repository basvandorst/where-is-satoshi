where is the girl that gives away btc. She should give this guy also some ;)

Could you draw Charlie Lee? :)

Does it affect breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:05:13
How? I read everywhere that we are waiting on some lighting network implementation...

tldr: Wien Austria, everybody talks about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is at ATH. 
Who are the other players -  Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash. Totally 1034 cryptos. 
Bitcoin is at 52Bn market cap, coins down the list have much lower market cap. Vertcoin is at place 107 with 20000$ market cap (*I believe 20k is a typo). 
Banks are interested in blockchain. Chief of national Austria Bank will not allow BTC to become a legal currency, because it is impossible to control. But the European Central Bank sees no reason to ban bitcoin.
Bitcoin had made it, a lot of other will probably not. You can now buy bitcoin at Austrian Post office.

Source or "in 2 weeks"TM? ;)?

That means atomic swaps will be also possible?
@_date: 2017-08-06 15:42:55
I have one question. 
Is the information about atomic saved saved in the blockchain or only on LN node? Is it possible to follow the coins to their original chains? Thanks!
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:59:31
With other segwit supported currencies (Litecoin, Vertcoin,...). This will allow decentralized exchangers.

Nobody is sure now how locking funds (needed for the lightning network) will be accepted from the user side.
Another alternative would be to swap bitcoin to another lower fee currency and do further transactions with it. This way is much simpler to understand for an average user.
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:31:37
It is possible that both possibilities will be used for different use case.  Lighting gives us the infrastructure and future will show how it will be used.
@_date: 2017-08-06 07:35:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:34:48
Thank you! Is atomic swaps then kind of a perfect mixer?
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:34:58
Can somebody clarify this for me - if I want to introduce somebody to btc can he install a wallet and receive lightning transaction without having any btc? Or he should at first have some btc for opening a channel?
What I mean previously with low transactions fees I could send them 2-5$ as introduction to btc and then they send their friend some small amount also. Will it be possible again with lightning? .. was really the best way to introduce people to btc.
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:46:53
Thank you very much for the explanation! So theoretically my friend could stay in LN channel funded by me and then send the transaction to somebody else.
I believe it will depend on concept and UI of LN wallets if the opinion to stay inside LN from start will be widely used. 
As to fees I don't think they will ever go down, the user base is growing exponentially.

I don't agree 100%  that this a political attack. Maybe the way how it is done looks like a political attack, but it was caused by several years turmoil in the bitcoin scaling debate. 
But back to your question - I hope monero could stay asic resistant and then there is one less factor in the power centralisation. And if there would be a real political attack on crypto currencies monero will be one of the first that would be attacked (because of fungibility), so there is a need in strong developers/community to withstand it. 
I also believe that a political attack on monero would not cause a split - monero will either withstand it or die, because of the basic principal decentralization that are the backbone of the coin and the community.

Don't sell. See it as 10% insurance.
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:10:50
My prediction -  the developers will change to Monero.

He himself organized miners roundtable to bring segwit forward in Litecoin (and even similair 2x part if the blocks gets bigger 500kB!). And now he is "NO2x" just to please the core developers and be in their favour. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:06:56
Just a guess: Both forks live, bitcoin is a mess for an average user (because of replay attacks). Trust is loss. No profit.  ??
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:51:55
Not only states, but the community itself. Do you *really* know how the segwit2x without replay protection will play out?
@_date: 2017-09-28 06:19:28
But the user opinion is influenced by miners. If an average user see that 93% of miners support 2x, so he will also likely support 2x. That's why mining centralization plays a big role in this debate. 
I also believe that a healthy bitcoin should not have a central authority (satoshi showed it us by example) and one central development team. So somehow now the core is also a weak point of bitcoin. Why not to have several competing development teams? 
I respect your work and hope you guys will further develop bitcoin even if 2x will be successful.
