Says the person who doesn't understand share buy backs and thinks that because 2 companies failed all companies cannot be trusted.

Again, false Repurchased shares do not carry any voting rights. 


Yes, and who owns all company assets? The shareholders... it's not rocket science.


Makes sense, ignorance is bliss after all...

�� that's exactly how buybacks work... other shares gain value


��‍♂️ when a buyback happens someone is selling their shares.
@_date: 2019-11-04 12:45:04


I mean that's basic math, if you have a $10 billion company with 10,000 shares each share is worth 1  million, if you buy back and destroy 200 shares now each share is worth 1.0248 million... 
Why are buybacks bad if dividends are ok?


Yes you can think of 2 companies that went tits up, that means all companies will go tits up.
With this level of investment knowledge you might want to reconsider attempting to make your own choices and see a fee based financial adviser.

More than 0.01% and the user base doubled year over year for the next 4 years, by 1997 they had already hit &gt;1% of the population. let's not forget 1/3 of people owned computers in 1997.
But we are also in a post internet era, facebook gained a billion users in 8 years from 2004-2012, bitcoin has &lt;10 million users almost 11 years after it's creation
So yeah pretend it's the internet except that it doesn't have similar adoption rates. Should i come back next year and ask why you haven't doubled the userbase?

What percentage of all internet transactions are in bitcoin? &lt;0.01%? &lt;0.001%?

�� The company owns the share aka it owns a % of itself, that means that really all shareholders own a larger % of the company. 
Let's Pretend there's a company with 4 shares, I own 2 and you own 2. We each own 50% of the company. 
The company then buys back one share, so now there's 3 outstanding shares, I own 2 and you own 1, I own 2/3% of the company and you own 1/3% of the company. The company also has a share but it's really shareholders who own a company so that share is essentially split up equally among all share holders. It's almost like that share was effectively destroyed...
If we later decided we could sell the share owned by the company and our % ownership of the company would decrease.

Is there a difference between that and them paying dividends while taking on debt?
In the end it depends on their ability to service their debt, 3M for example has debt that's equal to about 2(current) years of net income. That's a low risk.

I mean they effectively are, it's like if you owed yourself $1

��  Repurchased shares do not carry any voting rights, not to mention many shares that are issued don't have voting rights in the first place.


No they don't, that supply is owned by the company which is in turn owned by shareholders. The board doesn't get to pretend they own those shares.


It doesn't increase your vote, it increases the weight of your vote.
You keep going down a rabbit hole of absolute stupidity and every time you change your story you just look dumber and dumber. Like were you too stupid to even read wikipedia? did you try doing even a bit of research?
If I had your problem solving abilities I would probably hire someone to second guess every choice I made.

Are they? What makes 3M Company overvalued? what risks does it have of going tits up?
