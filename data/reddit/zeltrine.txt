Hello, I'm the director for Cryptonauts. We posted this video back in May right when the market was turning around, but yesterday I read [u/theonlykami123]( post [here]( and realized that many people don't know the growing pains of Bitcoin and the rate of technological adoption for new technologies.


The truth is that they don't need to know or care about Crypto to succeed...right now. Just like people didn't know or care about automobiles at the turn of the 20th Century, many would have rather stayed with their horses.


Right now, it is not our job to convince regular people to believe in crypto. Our goal now should be to only help those that truly want to understand. Blockchain tech is still nascent technology \- by the time the masses realize its benefit, blockchain tech will be everywhere much like how the internet was once thought of as a fad by many people. For Example: ["Newsweek: Why the Internet Will Fail"](
I'm interested in hearing your comments! Also, any suggestions or criticisms are welcomed.
