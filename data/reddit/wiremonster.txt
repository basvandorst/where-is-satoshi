Well, it's not 'my claim' and I said the state of affairs was hard to believe - not that it isn't believable. Clearly, I've read them and find enough of them believable to be surprised enough to make this post.
They are all online and searchable, it's not a secret.

Hi Justin.
Thank you for reaching out. It's good to hear that you do care about the direct customer experience.
While it's nice that you have an automated phone system to handle calls. It is not that case that you provide 24/7 phone support.
Many of the complaints from your customers regard missing bank transfers and similar problems relating to your customers funds. In these cases the Coinbase 'phone support' simply refers them back to the online support system and ends the call. I'm sure you would agree this is not actually '24/7 phone support'.
On the subject of bank transfers. Perhaps you could explain on this public forum why Coinbase will not attempt to locate any missing funds until 10 working days have passed (via online support only).
I'm sure you can appreciate that in the fast moving world of currency trading this does nothing for the reputation of the exchange. What reason could there be for this? (Apart from a very obvious fact that it allows Coinbase to effectively 'borrow' those funds at 0% interest.)
I appreciate you taking the time to reply to this genuine query in a public space... and I hope this helps.

Part of any successful business is managing public profile. It's not that difficult to get right... or perhaps there's a good reason why it is?

You can message apple publicly via twitter right now and they will respond publicly. They also have their own public forums that are serviced by their teams. I imagine microsoft have similar - it's standard practice right?
Hotel chains reply to poor review on tripadvisor.
Smaller companies will respond to reviews on the platform that is most relevant to their customer base.
Should a large number of negative reviews start appearing on a particular platform, it is standard practice to address them - rather than leave the public record simply sitting there making your operation look bad.
A company with 30 million users should be able to do that, right?

Hey, thanks for taking the time to reply and for the advice on security - much appreciated.
@_date: 2019-10-02 10:15:47
Great. Thank you for the advice, that's really helpful.

The OP does make it clear that I'm referring to online reviews of the service rather than a major event, maybe that's what you'd class as an 'idiot Joe'. But, rather than it being one Joe - it's high number of them using open review spaces where Coinbase are also provided a platform to respond.
Now, (obviously) their take is not 'this is my own stupidity' and since there's no response from Coinbase I have no reason to assume it is. In fact, many reviews give detailed accounts clearly written by people who it would be incorrect to label as 'idiots'.
I guess what I find surpising is that Coinbase seem to be a wholly legitimate operation - working in an area full of mistrust and they'd be doing their best to minimise that. It simply doesn't seem to be the case.

Thank you very much for this, really helpful.

That's simply not true. It is standard practice for large organisations to manage public customer relations via review platforms.
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:27:10
That's a point of view. I could buy that as a 'look on the bright side' sort of view, but not as a strategy.

Sure, there are bound to be cases where the client is at fault - it's not possible to accurately apportion blame. But even when it is the client who is at fault, it's still the responsibility of the exchange to ensure they are properly represented on a public forum. I don't see any evidence of that happening, so I guess I'm puzzled as to why that would be.
@_date: 2019-10-08 18:30:05
Yeah, curious.
I drew my conclusions about coinbase(pro) when I read the reviews. But, I was kind of wondering why - in a market that's so riddled with uncertainty - no exchange had risen to the top as being best for customer service.
Maybe it's just not the sort of space that attracts people who see value in integrity.
@_date: 2019-10-08 14:43:47
I can believe that. But I can't believe that all of, or even the majority of complaints are due to this.
@_date: 2019-10-08 16:35:59
Maybe you are correct, it's impossible to say. What is clear though, is that there's no public response to these complaints - just silence.
That's what has really spooked me about the platform. It's a simple job to address those reviews publicly in a way that protects their reputation or at least limits damage, but they haven't done that. It appears that they either don't understand the importance of customer service, or they simply don't care what customers think - existing or prospective.
Arrogance? Incompetence?
It's hard to fathom.

You are really claiming that Apple will not respond to public customer service enquiries on Twitter? Ok. Well I have no need to 'prove you wrong' - that's the nice thing about having a public communication.
