I wonder if they all bought sheets.

Aw man that sounds it could cause me some future headache.  A ZigGap rep told me send an online payment was ok.  I'll have to ask them about this.

Again, thank you for your insightful input. The connection between my story and OP's was MoneyGram.

Yes true and that's the scenario I'm afraid merchants will create.  If I travel to some country that uses the Euro, the cost of goods won't be related to the USD exchange rate.  Whereas merchants using bitcoins might solely base prices of off the exchange rate.

I feel your pain with MoneyGram.  My dumbass tried to pay online.  I don't care about being anon so I thought "screw it I'll use my card to send MoneyGram to ZigGap and the process won't take more than a hour or two."  After creating my payment/account with MoneyGram it gave me an error and I had to verify my identity with someone on the phone.  Fine.  I get to log in and submit my payment.  After 5 minutes of my "successful" payment I get an email from MoneyGram saying it's been cancelled (and I can't log in to my account).  I call them and they say (word for word) "Yes your payment was cancelled and your account has been disabled.  For security reasons we can't tell you why".  My brain is full of wut.

Is this evidence of market manipulation?

Don't worry he's mister mister.  When buttadmiral gets pissed, you get mist.

Yes true, very good points that I had forgotten about.  What about merchants who base their prices off of the USD exchange rate?  Is it only when merchants begin to start and operate purely off of BTC that it can start to become an independent entity?

You're right. ziggap =/= zipzap.  That's why I said ziggap dumbass.

Miscellanous question for you, if transactions are final, what if I pay a seller and they give me false goods or nothing at all?  There's no party in between us who will protect my right to that good or service (as credit card companies will do)....?
