Question: what application is that, and what sources are those (or where can I find them)?

He sent BTC _ BitGrail. If the transaction confirms, then it’s out of BitGrail’s control since the BTC is now in a Bitcoin.com wallet.
That’s probably why BitGrail didn’t reply to him, because it’s already out of their control.

You created a fresh account just to spam this post in different subs - so what’s your goal in posting these, and why are you not using your real account?
Are you trying to sell the bot? Or perhaps get more Twitter followers? Bacause right now, you can’t exactly PnD with less than 300 followers.

It’s not possible to restore a 2FA profile via cloud  backup. It’s also not possible to retrieve a 2FA secret key given the data stored by Google Authenticator. 
The only way you can restore a 2FA profile is if you saved the 2FA secret key (the one that came with the QR code that you scanned using the Google Authenticator app).
If you want to be able to restore a 2FA profile in case you lose your phone, the only solution is for you to temporarily disable 2FA on your exchange account, then re-enable it again using a newly generated 2FA secret key. Be sure to keep a backup of the secret key this time.

It’ll timeout eventually, and your wallet’s balance will go back to what it was before the transaction.

As of this reply, block 501753 was mined 55 minutes ago, then it took 50 minutes before the next one (block 501754) was mined. 
That’s the reason.

Ah, thank you. What's the issue with SMS based 2FA by the way, and don't some want it?
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:43:00
Sounds like a good plan to me. Good luck, and don't keep checking the charts.

Don't use SMS based 2FA, it's not as secure as using Google Authenticator. (*one of the reasons is your SIM card can be stolen, or someone can impersonate you, walk into your telco's office, declare the SIM card lost, then get it replaced, but with the same mobile number*)
Now regarding the Google Authenticator seed; when you get shown the seed/QR code during 2FA setup, take a picture of it, or find a way to securely print it, then store it in a safe place.
You can always rescan that same seed even if you lose your phone.

Just did a little withdrawal from Bittrex, worked flawlessly
@_date: 2017-10-12 09:29:12
Member number 1, LOL. Good luck!

But, but, they said they have “overwhelming” miner support?
@_date: 2017-09-18 10:55:57
He most likely had alts that lost value vs the BTC.

I highly doubt CD-Rs can even still be read after 10 years.
Try holding a 5 year old CD-R to a light source and you'll see tiny little holes. This is because the data is located in just one side of the plastic, protected from oxidation only by a thin layer of paint, or film. If anything, my bet are on DVD-Rs, since the data is sandwiched between 2 pieces of plastic.

Facebook is just a website, and a computer science major like you should easily be able to build a website right? What’s stopping you from building that Facebook competition website, making billions off of it, cashing out, then doing it all over again?
If you can answer that then the same thing applies to your question. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:26:41
That is correct. Make sure never to expose the private key anywhere/any medium, like taking a picture of it using an internet connected device.

Careful about believing what this guy is saying. You asked about Coinbase, and he gave a wrong response backed by a publication talking about Bitfinex.

Airbitz on iOS is great, better fees when transacting compared to Breadwallet also.

You don't actually start jumping out at that speed, but at lower speed at the beginning, and then progress from there.

Noob question: is it possible for the miners who forked off to reduce the difficulty at the time of the fork, so they can still mine blocks every 10 minutes?
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:37:34
Not OP, but good vid! Thanks for the link. :-)
@_date: 2017-07-13 15:37:56
Advance apologies if I'll post a noob question instead: which one among the two will be the dominantly Chinese one? And is this the one I read about the Jihan miners?

If everything looks fine on the screen, and it's just the the QR code that's not getting printed, then the issue is with the printer driver. Try printing to PDF first, load it to Acrobat, then print it. If that doesn't work, just screenshot the page then print the image.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:34:53
Oh I misunderstood your statement. Sorry about that, and thanks for pointing it out. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:28:07
How can an address possibly be destroyed by sending a tiny amount to it?
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:47:34
Sorry, but what's a Non-SMS 2FA device?
