Dogecoin was just a spoof on Bitcoin.  It's merely a joke with no real value.  The same can be said for Litecoin or any other alt-coin currently in circulation (with the possible exception of Namecoin), the only difference being that many of their supporters actually take them seriously.  For investing, stick to Bitcoin unless you are the type to gamble with penny stocks.

Not necessarily.   If he wishes to minimize his exposure he can simply buy 50 BTC at a time, transfer to Coinbase, and sell immediately, rinse and repeat.  There is no need to hold bitcoin longer than it takes for the sale and transfer to confirm.

It has nothing to do with appstore rules.  The applications are submitted by reputable developers following any and all guidelines available.  When apps are removed Apple refuses to state any specific reasons nor what is needed to comply with whatever unnamed policy it is that instigated their actions.
Essentially, it appears there is no policy other than that Apple sees Bitcoin as a threat to the payments platform they hope to implement internally.

Like I said, it's really not hard.  Just create a spreadsheet and a couple of macros and plug in your transactions.  Even if you don't have specific dollar amounts for a particular transaction, you always have the BTC amount and dates and whether it's incoming or outgoing. You can just use the daily exchange rate as your cost basis for that transaction (all done automatically by excel).

Overall it is a good plan and very similar to the [procedure]( I have written up in the [Security Guide]( from the sidebar.
There two critical elements missing however.  
First, in addition to disabling wifi, I would not only disable but uninstall this capability completely going so far as uninstalling drivers.  I would do this also for the ethernet port as well.  Also, don't forget about Bluetooth, Speakers, and microphones.  These should be disabled as well.  Ideally you would physically remove these components from the system and even epoxy the ethernet port.
Second, you should have full disk encryption on the offline system.  Just be sure to manage your encryption keys/passwords properly.

Nobody (except miners disappointed that they were late for the Bitcoin train) cares about differences in how various alt coins are mined.  Unless an altcoin can provide a significant FUNCTIONAL advantage that isn't possible with Bitcoin it will never overcome Bitcoin's network effect.  None of those you have listed (nor any other altcoins currently in existence) meet this standard.  
Even if an altcoin were developed with a readily apparent functional advantage it will still have difficulty supplanting Bitcoin.  Remember, it is a protocol, not a service and first mover advantage is huge.  We still use protocols such as SMTP, DNS, and IPv4 even though far better alternatives exist because of such network effects.  This is most easily illustrated with IPv4.  Engineers have been warning for years that the world must transition to IPv6 but even now that the IPv4 address space has been exhausted, IPv6 solutions are still merely being shoehorned into the existing infrastructure.
EDIT:  I'm not saying that it is impossible for an altcoin to succeed.  Just that none of those currently available even come close to having what it takes to do so.  The only one I see with any potential future is Namecoin and only because it uses it's blockchain for a completely different purpose than Bitcoin.  It is not designed for use in everyday transactions.

Bit is a very natural and good option.  It has the linguistic similarity to Bitcoin which automatically makes it an easier association for the general public,  people already envision it as part of a larger whole (bits of a bitcoin makes sense intuitively and the 1,000,000 to 1 conversion is a no brainer), and the word already has connotations with money.  
The only real linguistic conflict is that to a bit of data but the context of the conversation will make it immediately clear which you are talking about.  Even if you are a programmer discussing your latest Bitcoin software project, you will much more likely speak of data in terms of bytes.
@_date: 2014-01-28 17:21:43
It is because Namecoin is not intended for use in trade.  It is designed to be a marker for a distributed DNS protocol.  It is still not something to invest in but unlike other alt-coins it does bring something useful to the table.  No other alt-coin has any innovation to distinguish it from Bitcoin enough to provide an actual value proposition.  Altered mining protocols and block times have no real impact on their usefulness, which in the end is the only metric that matters.
Note that I am not opposed to innovation within the alt-coin space but to date there really hasn't been any.

That's the idea and if bits become the common usage it will happen naturally.  Millibits is incorrect anyway.  It should be pronounced millibitcoin but in this scenario, people will gravitate towards defining that value in terms of bits instead of full bitcoin.  The fact people say millibits simply illustrates the whole point of this discussion and the argument for using bits in the first place which is all about the psychology of numbers and language, especially when dealing with money.  It is not just a debate in semantics.  It is about making bitcoin more digestible (and useful) for the masses.
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:16:59
I disagree.  People intuitively understand whole numbers, even large ones, better than decimals.  Also, even though I used fairly round numbers here, prices, especially for small items, are a little more granular.  Therefore, by the time the price reaches just $10,000, many daily purchases would be not only under 1 mBTC but will also best be rounded to 3 or even 4 decimal places even though most accounting software is written to 2 decimal places.  
With "bits" this will probably never be an issue.  Furthermore, it's probable people will naturally begin to refer to mBTC as Kbits which will still hold parity with the dollar @ $1000 while naturally progressing if/as the exchange rate continues to rise.  Even better, at $10,000, a bit will be in parity with the penny, another very natural and easy conversion for people to make.
It also makes the reverse exchange rate (i.e. BTC/$) much simpler.  This is important psychologically because people will much rather exchange a dollar for 400 bits @ $2500/BTC than they will 0.4mBTC.
$500.00 | $2,500.00 | $10,000.00 | $50,000.00 | $100,000.00 | $500,000.00 | $1,000,000.00
0.002 BTC | 0.0004 BTC | 0.0001 BTC | 0.00002 BTC | 0.00001 BTC | 0.000002 BTC | 0.000001 BTC
2 mBTC | 0.4 mBTC | 0.1 mBTC | 0.02 mBTC | 0.01 mBTC | 0.002 mBTC | 0.001 mBTC
2000 bits | 400 bits | 100 bits | 20 bits | 10 bits | 2 bits | 1 bits
tl;dr mBTC has neither the psychological value or practical utility of µBTC (bits).  Additionally, by using mBTC as a base unit, this whole question will need to be revisited before long if Bitcoin continues to succeed.

With Armory, you sign the transaction from the offline computer.  The private keys NEVER touch the internet.  Also, Armory is deterministic.  All possible change addresses are accessible using the same paper or digital backup.

Litecoin is pointless.  There is nothing one can do with Litecoin that can't be accomplished within the Bitcoin protocol.  It (and all other alt-coins with the possible exception of Namecoin) only exists because people who were late to the Bitcoin mining party wanted to get free money from their computer.  They will all eventually fade into obscurity.
I am not saying that an alt-coin can't have value but for that to happen it would have to provide some actual and significant value proposition that cannot be accomplished by Bitcoin itself.  Different mining algorithms, block times, currency limits, etc. don't qualify as they have little or no bearing on the fundamental utility of the protocol.
@_date: 2014-04-17 08:44:57
Good call for choosing Armory.  Leave your current wallet offline (and by offline, I assume you mean that the computer itself is not able to access the internet, otherwise, there is no point).  Set up Armory on an online computer and create a watching only wallet.  From here you can monitor balances, generate new addresses, and even initiate transactions.  You just need a thumb drive to copy the transaction to the offline computer to be signed then you transfer it back to the online machine to broadcast the signed transaction.
Armory also has terrific multi-wallet support so you can keep the bulk of your funds in the offline wallet for security but have a small amount in a second, online wallet for easy access.
EDIT:  Understand however that Armory runs a full node using Bitcoin-QT as the engine so you will need both the time and disk space to download the blockchain before you are able to spend your funds.  If you wish to do so soon, I recommend starting now.

OK, if an application interacts with Bitcoin, the developers of that application should probably establish a best practice of using the more formal micro-bitcoin when speaking of the currency in this context, but this is an isolated and uncommon situation. The broader conversation here is about making Bitcoin more practically useful (i.e. using µBTC as the base unit) and psychologically digestible (i.e. calling them "bits") for the masses.  The chance that a couple of developers somewhere might have some slight miscommunication on occasion that could be easily avoided with a simple internal policy is a small price for such a great benefit.

It works from this point forward.  I made [this chart]( to show prices of various items at various bitcoin rates using different bitcoin values as the base unit.

Their liability is already clearly defined and no such lawsuit would ever see the inside of a courtroom.  The only potential liability that might exist is if somehow bitcoin are lost from the wallet because of poorly written code and this would fall upon the developer who in turn should have a terms of use provision clearly stating "use at your own risk."  This is something any knowledgeable bitcoin user will be aware of already.

That is not at all what it means.  In fact, though it is legally denied (except through a particular unusual loophole that some have suggested should be exploited if it comes to it), printing money to pay off debt would be about the only way out that doesn't likely cause an immediate global recession.  However, it would probably create inflation, the markets would be badly shaken, and a recession would still be very possible if not likely. 
Bitcoin would likely rise but how much is a matter of complete guesswork.
While a shutdown is detrimental and inhibits growth, the failure of the bond market would be an economic catastrophe.  There is no good reason for house Republicans to not increase the debt ceiling without condition unless they are absolute sociopaths.

This sounds like a massive rationalization to me.  If the problem is a lack of liquidity in the bitcoin market, attempting to compensate using an alt coin with a monetary base orders of magnitude lower will only exacerbates the issue.  Alt coins, or at least those currently available, have no real value proposition.  For an  alt coin to have value it would need to provide some tangible and easily apparent feature which is 
not possible to implement within the bitcoin protocol.
EDIT:  It may not exasperate the problem but it still will not alleviate it to any significant degree unless you have EXTREMELY high volume active traders with a close eye on the market specifically looking for arbitrage opportunities.  Even then it only works if there are near 0% conversion fees between the alt coin in question and bitcoin on all exchanges.

I bought @ $3 after the first big boom and bust in 2011.  I did this with an amount of money I was perfectly willing to lose but I never considered it a gamble nor was my decision based on any hype.  In fact almost every article on the subject at the time was declaring "the death of Bitcoin" or referring to it using terms like "failed experiment".  Unlike the naysayers (then and now) however I understand the protocol and recognize it as the breakthrough technology that it is.  As such, I made an informed investment based on the fundamentals of the platform.  Obviously, at the time this would have been considered a very high risk investment, as it still should, and I recognize it as such, but it was a well considered and reasoned addition to a balanced portfolio.  As it turns out, so far it is the best investment I have ever made.

Install Armory to a computer whose network capabilities have been completely disabled and with full disk encryption to generate wallets.  Print paper backups and stick them in a sealed envelope.  Make digital backups, encrypt those using truecrypt and copy to a thumb drive. Place the envelope and thumb drive in a safe deposit box.  Save multiple copies of the truecrypt file but never with your encryption passwords.  In fact, those should be memorized and documented only in a second, secured location for use by beneficiaries if necessary.
You can then make watching only wallets for monitoring and receiving funds on an online computer.  To spend funds you can have an online wallet with a few coins for small transactions. For larger transfers simply use your encrypted offline computer to sign the transaction with the aid of a thumb drive.

I watched the market like a hawk and bought 3 BTC @ $653 for a total profit of ~1.01 BTC which I sold @ Coinbase minutes later @ $812.

I did the same (in San Francisco) and it didn't go so well.  
For the record, I was (and still am) intoxicated so my perspective may be distorted as well as my behavior at the time, but through my eyes, this is what happened.
I flagged a cab and hopped in.  I told the driver the destination, asked if he was the cab I called (no, different company).  I called Yellow Cab (that never showed) and cancelled my order.  I then jokingly asked the driver if he accepted bitcoin. 
 "What's that?" he asks.  
I explain to him it is a digital currency that allows people to exchange value without the need of a central clearinghouse.  
"Basically, it's money you can exchange with your phone."
"Sounds like bullshit to me"
At this point in my mind I'm thinking, "OK, this is a hopeless case," but in  my drunkenness I continue...
"Whatever, this bullshit has paid off my student loans and has allowed me to become debt free."  OK, a little douchy but his tone was deliberately provocative.
"It still sounds like bullshit."
Fine.  If he doesn't want to hear it I'm not a missionary, but still, "It's a revolution.  You'll know about it soon enough."
At this point he became openly antagonistic.  Fortunately, we were close to my destination.  My street is just off the freeway not accessible via a left turn and not familiar to many cab drivers.  You need to make a semi legal maneuver to avoid driving a half mile out of the way but at this point he wasn't hearing anything I had to say.  He managed to get me home but there was an easier route.  I tipped him $3 on a $20 fare and told him (honestly), "it would have been ten if you were cool."  Again I was a dick but in my view he deserved it.
Personally, I don't think I was so drunk, pushy, or aggressive that his behavior was warranted.  I could be wrong.

Mining using your laptop alone will earn pennies a year and cost multitudes more than that in electricity alone. Any mining now is expensive and unlikely to earn returns greater than the bitcoin cost of the specialized hardware required.  You are better off just putting the money you would otherwise use on mining directly into bitcoin (but not more than you are willing to lose).

Bicoin is a protocol like http, not a service like Myspace.  Protocols are much more difficult to supplant due to supporting infrastructure and investment.  Generally, once established a protocol need not be perfect to maintain nearly insurmountable dominance, it only needs to be good enough to support it's primary function.  Think of email, dns, and even IPv4.  There are now more efficient, secure, and generally better protocols that allow for the same (and improved) functionality for all of these but each still rules it's own realm.  Even with IPv4 being replaced with IPv6 out of pure necessity, the world still operates primarily in the former while merely shoehorning in the latter.

I am a progressive social libertarian who consistently votes Democrat. Furthermore I recognized the potential of Bitcoin the first time I learned of it however this appreciation was based upon the protocol as opposed to any economic or political ideology.
Liberal and libertarian are not mutually exclusive and libertarianism is not synonymous with small government, unbridled free market capitalism as too many Americans falsely believe.  It is simply about individual (not corporate or institutional) freedoms.  While I recognize the fact that government is potentially the greatest single threat to liberty, under an informed electorate it can also be liberty's greatest defender with regulation as its most powerful tool.

This.  Miners always seem to think that the difficulty/cost of mining has an impact on price.  The fact is that even if difficulty quadrupled daily for a month it would not have any effect on demand (or supply for that matter).  Of course miners wouldn't be happy and many might shut down their equipment but the market would not move a dime based on any of this.
Miners are fundamentally important to the operation of Bitcoin but traders and end users couldn't care less whether or not they are profitable.

The feature you describe can be easily disabled.  Even so, if you are seriously paranoid then format the thumb drive from the offline computer prior to each offline transaction and ensure the transaction file is the only file on the thumb drive when you bring it back over.  In any case, anybody who can write malware sophisticated enough to piggyback a thumb drive, deliver it's payload without the use of autoplay, harvest KeePass, Wallet files, key files, and passwords without any outside control or guidance, then piggyback to the thumb drive again to deliver its spoils via an online computer without drawing attention would likely be able to compromise any platform.

You are going off the assumption that increasing difficulty somehow drives interest in Bitcoin and /or mining.  This simply is not the case.  There is no reason to believe a change in the processing power of the network would have any connection to the amount of money entering/exiting the market.  They are simply unrelated.  Mining bitcoin and speculating on it are entirely different investment decisions.
EDIT (clarification):  Actually I do believe that increased difficulty and price/interest are related, just in the reverse direction.  (i.e. - increased interest in bitcoin drives prices creating incentive to mine thereby increasing difficulty.  Not the other way around.)

While I agree that not everybody needs to understand what a hashing algorithm is, in my experience I have found that until somebody has a basic understanding of the blockchain as a distributed and decentralized transaction ledger they are unlikely to trust that Bitcoin can do any of those things you mention.  For Bitcoin to thrive, people do need a fundamental understanding of the core architecture of the protocol.  Without recognizing Bitcoin's unique properties people are unable to distinguish it from a ponzi scheme, eGold, Facebook credits, beanie babies, or any number of other schemes or failed ideas they may associate.

Bitcoin transaction fees are technically voluntary though it is strongly recommended that you include them for your transaction to be entered in the blockchain quickly.  The default fee however is only 100 [bits]( (0.0001BTC or approximately $0.10) regardless of the amount sent.  High priority transactions (higher transaction values or seasoned bitcoin) will generally be included in the next block even without fees.  Smaller transactions or bitcoin spent from recent or numerous inputs may require fees of 500 bits or greater.

Why?  it offers nothing not already achievable with Bitcoin.  Alt-coins, or at least the ones developed so far have no value proposition.  For an alt-coin to be relevant it would need to have some property that provides additional benefits, features, and/or functionality.  Different hashing algorithms, mining protocols, or confirmation times really mean nothing to end users and the market as a whole.  The current batch of alt coins are only valued by miners who can no longer mine Bitcoin profitably or were too late to the game and I will bet none last more than a couple of years.

Here is how I did it:
1. Take an old computer and first epoxy the ethernet port so it not able to go online.  Remove or disconnect any WiFi and/or Bluetooth cards, and any other networking components. Disconnect and/or disable any microphones and speakers.
2. Install Windows completely formatting the drive in the process.  Many users here will tell you to avoid Windows and use Linux but since this computer is completely offline it does not much matter.  Use your preferred OS.  I additionally uninstalled and/or disabled certain services critical for networking but otherwise unneeded for normal operation.  It is also good to disable any other unnecessary services.  Be sure to disable autoplay.  Set the BIOS to not automatically boot from CD or USB and disable any unnecessary components (networking, bluetooth, audio, etc.).  You can set up BIOS security as well but if you do, be sure document the passwords.
3. Install TrueCrypt and fully encrypt the system drive.  All software installers and other files will need to be transferred via a thumb drive.  Use an **extremely strong password** that you do not use elsewhere.  MEMORIZE THIS PASSWORD AND WRITE IT DOWN TEMPORARILY ON A PIECE OF PAPER!!!  **NEVER ENTER THIS PASSWORD INTO ANY OTHER COMPUTER OR DEVICE.**  Let the encryption process complete 100% before proceeding.  Reboot the system and test to ensure you are able to decrypt the drive and log in to the operating system.
4. Install Armory, KeePass, Foxit PDF, CutePDF writer, and Eraser.  You may wish to install Electrum as well.  You will need a printer so it may be necessary to load a driver for it as well. If possible, use a printer without network capabilities or persistent memory.
5.  Create a KeePass file.  I always secure KeePass with a key file in addition to a password.  Do not use the same password for the KeePass file as you used to encrypt your drive.  This password should also be memorized.  DO NOT ENTER YOUR TRUECRYPT PASSWORD INTO THE KEEPASS FILE!  You can however enter your windows and bios passwords if you like.  I also configure KeePass to generate random 30+ character passwords using upper, lower, and numeric.  
6.  I generate my wallets in Armory.  Since this computer is offline Armory does not require a great deal of resources and will not download the blockchain.  Note that you will not be able to check balances from this system.  I secure each wallet with a separate KeePass generated password and document these in the KeePass file.  I then generate watching only wallets that I store to a folder on the offline computer and also attach them to the associated KeePass entry for ease of access.  DO NOT ATTACH YOUR ACTUAL WALLET, OR ANY DIGITAL OR PAPER BACKUPS TO KEEPASS!  I also create a paper backup and save this on the offline computer using CutePDF Writer as well as a digital backup of the wallet file.  Since Armory creates deterministic wallets, these are the only backups you will ever need.  Print the paper backups and place them into a tamper evident envelope.  Keep this in a secured location such as a safe deposit box.
NOTE: This can also be done using Electrum but Armory has a much better interface and multi-wallet support.  The online version of Armory however does require a robust computer and a full download of the blockchain.  I will use Electrum only if I expect that the specific wallet I am generating will be the only wallet monitored on an online system with limited resources.
7.  Create a text file on the offline computer documenting the TrueCrypt password and key files, KeePass password and key files, the operating system and BIOS passwords, as well as instructions on how to access the offline computer, TrueCrypt file, KeePass file, paper wallets, key files, and any other critical information one might need.  Print this out, place it in a temper evident envelope,  and keep it in a second secured location available to whomever might need access to it in case of death or an emergency.  Be sure you and they have access to **unencrypted** copies of your key files.  You can now destroy the paper on which you originally wrote your TrueCrypt password.
8.  Create a TrueCrypt file on the offline computer.  For simplicity you can use the same encryption password as you did for the HDD earlier but you may also wish to add a key file.  Place copies of the KeePass file, digital backups, watch only backups, and anything else you may ever need should the offline computer fail.  Optionally, you can also add the paper backups and written instructions (read paragraph in italics for considerations).  You can now copy the TrueCrypt file to a thumb drive and from there various other locations from where it may be reliably accessed.
*You may wish to choose not to store copies of the paper backups in the TrueCrypt file.  The paper backups are enough in themselves to fully restore your wallets and spend funds,  therefore, if somebody does manage to open your TrueCrypt file, they would have total control over your Bitcoin.  By not storing the paper backups in the TrueCrypt file, you ensure someone would need access to both the digital backups (stored in the TrueCrypt file) and the passwords (stored in KeePass) to move funds.  The same holds true for the offline computer.  If you do choose not to save the paper backups (or delete them using Eraser), even if somebody manages to decrypt your drive they will still need to open KeePass to spend your Bitcoin.  For this to be effective however, you must be sure not to copy the instructions file you created earlier into the TrueCrypt file, or in the case of the offline computer, you should use Eraser to delete it, because it contains your KeePass password.  The main disadvantage to not including these files would be if, unbeknownst to you, one of your digital wallet files were corrupt.  If this were the case and for some reason you cannot access the paper backup you could lose your coins.*
You can test the integrity of an offline wallet without compromising security by signing a message from the offline computer using the private key then, from another computer, validating the signature against the public key.
**IMPORTANT:** IF FOR ANY REASON THE TRUECRYPT FILE IS EVER DECRYPTED FROM A SYSTEM OTHER THAN ANOTHER OFFLINE COMPUTER OVER WHICH YOU HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL, ALL YOUR WALLETS AND ENCRYPTION KEYS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED COMPROMISED. IF THIS OCCURS, I ADVISE YOU TO CREATE NEW WALLETS USING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PASSWORDS AND TRANSFER ALL BITCOIN FROM THE OLD TO THE NEW WALLETS!!!
Even though the KeePass file does contain all of your wallet passwords, since it holds neither any wallet backups nor your TrueCrypt password, even if an attacker gains access to this file your Bitcoin will be secure.  Still, if you suspect the KeePass file to have been compromised you should again at the very least create new wallets using different passwords and move your coins (and don't forget to back them up again!)
That is it.  You can now set up a fully operational copy of Armory (or Electrum) on an online system and import your watching only wallets as well as your KeePass file. These can be copied unencrypted from the offline computer to a live system via a thumb drive. (Just be sure that you are not also copying your actual wallets, digital or paper backups, or instructions file.)  This way you can track balances and receive Bitcoin.  If you ever need to spend any Bitcoin, you can create the transaction from your online computer and sign it with the offline computer using a thumb drive (Armory makes this very easy).  For added convenience, you can import a full digital backup of one or more of your wallets to hold smaller amounts of Bitcoin on your live system so you don't have to sign minor transactions offline. Just remember that whichever wallets you do bring online should never again be considered as secure as those kept completely offline.

Coinbase using their own pricing algorithm that seems to be mainly tied to the Bitstamp rate with adjustments made based on immediate demand within their own system.  During long periods of low volume trading and not much movement, it is usually just the Bitstamp rate.  Most commonly, it is slightly higher than Bitstamp for both buying and selling.  At times of extreme demand I have even seen Coinbase trade higher than MtGox again for both buying and selling.  I haven't seen it but I'm guessing on a major selloff they would fall below Bitstamp.
Overall, Coinbase rates are fair market value minus a 1%+$0.15 fee.  If you are consistently trading 10% above or below whichever market rate you are watching and always in the wrong direction this suggests that you are timing your purchases in reaction to the market.  Though day trading is usually a bad idea, doing so on Coinbase is worse.  They are not an exchange.  You should consider them more like a broker.  If you do want to make these types of trades I suggest setting up an account with a proper exchange.

Just to be clear I am only having fun with the repeated calls to switch to mBTC or even as one redditor suggested, to actually move the decimal in the protocol itself.  
Personally I believe that part of the beauty of Bitcoin is that people can decide for themselves to present their prices or set their clients (wallets) to display in whatever units they prefer.  In any case, people will choose whatever makes sense for them and there is even the possibility users will come to a consensus, and if not, so be it.
tl;dr:  Don't tell me what to do
EDIT: grammar

Why should his father use localbitcoins?  The only difficulty here seems to be acquiring bitcoin with pounds.  His father can simply set up a [Coinbase]( account for conversion to dollars.

Actually the (very) early Jalapenos are probably the only BFL ASICS that might potentially turn a profit.

No, it just causes more panic by not allowing for proper price discovery.

You need to build upon the systems in place.  Attempting to tear them down only creates chaos (in the unlikely event you succeed) and trying to work around them is ineffective.

If you are using bitcoin as a short term investment you're doing it wrong.

Bitcoin is not a company and trades like a commodity.

Sorry, the only part of my comment directed towards you was my clarification that it wasn't a serious post.  The rest was just a rant on the entire mBTC controversy.

You can still use bitcoin in exchange for goods and services both domestically and internationally.  Exchanges are only needed to convert to another currency and even that can be done person to person for cash if necessary.  All of this can be accomplished with or without the consent of the local government.

Many within this new breed of self proclaimed libertarians really do not understand the fundamental tenets of their professed ideology.  Libertarianism is about the protection of INDIVIDUAL liberties from any person, group, or institution that may threaten them.  While governments obviously possess the potential to gravely endanger the most basic human rights and liberties, true libertarians recognize that it is only through the use of an effective government held accountable by an informed and active electorate that you are able to defend INDIVIDUAL liberties from powerful entities not necessarily operating in the public interest.  
Corporations are not persons deserving of the protections outlined within the constitution.  They are institutions that operate through the grant of a public charter.  As such, this charter should be written and enforced in a manner that compels corporations to act in the better interests of society as a whole.  Failure to do so should result in the dissolution of the charter.
EDIT: tl;dr - Government isn't the enemy of libertarians, it is their tool.  As such, it needs the power to exert influence over corporations and other special interests.

I think he means that there may not be a single seller with enough Bitcoin to cover the entire purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:31:58
I have bought during this notice and still had the bitcoin available immediately.  This happens when they run out of funds on the exchanges and begin trading within their own systems.  Since there is no order book, they cannot know if there will be a seller to match your order even though there generally is.  They are simply covering their bases.

I doubt this will have much impact on price.  For one thing, Russia was never responsible for a huge run up.  Also, there isn't much trade in Rubles.

No offense but there is no chance I would ever send anything to that address.  I applaud the effort if true but I have no idea who created this or if the money is being used responsibly, effectively, and for it's intended purpose.

I would wait until contacting the Secret Service field office at 415-576-1210.  They might want to have a look at them.  
Also, you might need to wait for house Republicans to get over their latest tantrum, I'm not sure this qualifies as an essential service.

This is not some online wallet.  It is a product available only to accredited investors.  Basically, it is a managed trust.  Sure, the fees are high but for a wealthy investor having an established and reputable firm manage an asset class with high growth potential whose properties you do not fully understand might be an attractive option.

Until an alt coin actually provides something of value not already achievable with Bitcoin nobody will care or have any interest in using them.  Litecoin, Primecoin, Namecoin, etc. despite whatever 'unique' features they may have are not innovative and provide no utility that cannot be implemented within the Bitcoin protocol itself.
