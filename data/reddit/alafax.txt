good luck with trading. If I knew that Bitfinex has no cold wallet at all I would never trade at it.I was misguided by their statement about 0.5% BTCs only in hot wallet and thought that rest of BTCs - 99.5% are in cold storage.
I cant find any other words than that running major exchange without cold wallet is completely insane and unbelievable negligence.
If they open site again without cold wallet,resume trading will be pointless.Before any opening they will have to persuade traders in security measures on site.

this is not haircut,this is headcut

We are in complete dark,because Bitfinex did not give any data neccessary to verify their claims. First of all list of hacker transactions - they just said that hacker sent BTC to addresses with first letter 1,but every BTC address except multi sig is beginning with 1 ,so without exact list of hacker transactions,no one outside can verify it - it is impossible to distinct hacker transactions from normal withdrawals.
They gave no disclosure of total amount of BTCs on exchange before hack.
They gave no disclosure of their BTC/cash reserves and how much of them they will use to compensate losses.
They have to public all necessary data,so it will be possible to verify theirs claims independently.

It seems they decided to socialize losses among bitcoin balances and active loans to BTCUSD positions

36% cut from all assets means that 119K of BTC were 66-70% of whole sum of BTCs on Bitfinex which was no more than 180 - 200K or about 50% that on Coinbase. Highly unlikely and Bitfinex never revealed how much of BTCs were on Bitfinex prior to hack.
Also Bitfinex didnot say how much of 119K BTC loss they will compensate from their reserves and assets? With 36% cut on all assets and accounts it looks to me as 0%.
What will they do with 36% of siezed USD,LTC,ETH,ETC. Sell them for BTC? That would make significant blow on price of these coins.
BFX tokens, selling shares of IFinex.It is very distant and unsecure future.It will be great luck if some compensation will ever come from them.After this hack and haircut,trading volume on Bitfinex will have huge drop and exchange will be worth much less than before all of it.

Bitfinex moved remaining BTCs - 71335 BTC to new multisig(again) address 35emx395afKAKAr72VoePVbu3FJvxLPVny. So with theft of 119K BTC,it seems that there were 119 + 71.3 ~ 190.3K BTCs in Bitfinex wallet - hacker took ~ 62.5% of BTCs on Bitfinex.
2 years ago Bitstamp revealed in Proof of Solvency test that it has ~ 184K of BTCs. Coinbase has 380-400K ,Kraken more than 200K.
It seems that Bitfinex wasnt largest BTC/USD exchange and that their assets actually were in the size of much lesser exchanges like Bitstamp and BTC-e,which is quite odd and hard to believe.

you are right.36% cut of all coins and assets means that they lost at least 70% of BTC in hack.But without cold and hot wallet it is very difficult to verify how much BTCs were on exchange before hack and how much were taken by hacker,so except them no one can know real numbers.They didnt disclose these numbers and addresses,nor the state of their cash&amp;coins reserves

I assume that Bitfinex has substantial BTC &amp; USD reserves and equities.Before any haircut of BTC holders they should put it to cover losses.If Bitstamp could cover 19000 BTC immediately,I will be very suprise if Bitfinex reserves are less than 50-60000 BTCs.Bitfinex reserves and equities should cover at least 2/3 of losses and in that case haircut will be reasonable.

Bitfinex should release informations about:
- how much BTC,USD,LTC,ETH&amp;ETC were on exchange in the moment of hack
- how much are Bitfinex reserves of coins&amp;cash + list of all assets 
- how much of theirs coins&amp;cash Bitfinex used for loss compensation

Coinbase has about 350.000 BTCs in their cold wallets and Coinbase volume is a 1/3 of Bitfinex - so Bitfinex should have at least 1.000.000 BTCs.
There are about 2 millions of BTC in multisig wallets and Bitfinex is by far the biggest owner of it.So,at least 1 million BTCs.

Zane,guys who are working on txs tracking should pay special attention to address 1Pm9qMnyfxMVNHdEBJwkGaN7LKPLpBz281 which is deposit address on OKCoin.This address was formed on 29th.Dec.2013(almost 3 years ago) and was completely dormant until few days ago.It suddenly activated few days ago  and start to pull out large amounts of BTC exclusively from Bitfinex.All deposits to this address  are from Bitfinex.First deposit after 3 years were 446.93 BTC from Bitfinex on 21st.June.On 2nd.Aug it pull out 490 BTCs(total 1342 BTC).It is extremely unusual that one address activate after 3 years with such big transactions.It could be that is hacker test address where he was testing ability to transfer BTCs from Bitfinex and sell them on other exchange before he did major hack.

Many people talks about connection betweent BTC and USDT,but in fact there is much bigger connection between USDT and altcoins which are traded for USDT.If you look at Poloniex and Bittrex USDT volume,you can see that altcoins USDT pairs make 2/3 of USDT total volume.So ,any problem about Tether and USDT should reflect on these altcoins much more than on BTC,because theirs USDT trading volume has much bigger part in total volume trading than it is a case for BTC. But in reality it is not the case.Why? Also today BTC goes down almost 20%, but USDT/USD just went down for 1% or less(if all is true it should went down 20% or more) - clearly whole noise,fake news,half truths about it was for purpose of creating mass panic and buying BTCs with a big discount.

There are 2,2 billions of USDT.During last year and in January we have few very big dips.It is impossible that nobody during the year did not cash out USDT from BTC or altcoins trading.People takes profit.Also in January Chinese exchanges bought almost 700 millions of USDT.There are extremely stupid or they have know the truth.For me it is very hard to believe that other exchanges would invest so much money in USDT blindly.But,no doubt Tether will have to give some stronger proofs of their cash reserves soon.
