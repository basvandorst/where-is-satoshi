Yeah crypto is not a stock, therefore if stocks crash people would invest in bitcoin to mitigate their losses you fucking dumbass. I never said bitcoin was **less** volatile than stocks. Learn to read.

I mean it's already here on the mainnet and it's being implemented as we speak. 
It's not like somebody's going to press the Lightning Network button and every transaction will magically be perfect. 
It's being developed for use today, it will be a slow gain. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:36:24


Except it's still a decentralized international hedge against stock volatility and/or fiat hyperinflation, and it is the oldest and most secure crypto having survived numerous attacks over its 9 year lifespan.  
Gold is a store of value and has a market cap of $7T. Bitcoin is a bit more convenient than gold.
P.S. Lightning Network and Atomic Swaps will solve high fees and slow transaction times

Yeah they're also not cryptos and they have an ROI of 5% after inflation. 


Exchanges literally have nothing to do with Bitcoin. What a terrible argument.

I would LOVE this.
Something like fork.lol 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:51:42
Yeah and gold's intrinsic value is way lower than its market value, most people aren't buying gold for their fucking transistors.

Devil's advocate as a long term Bitcoin (and LTC) and Eth holder: 
Ethereum resolves their scalability issues, people see it as a viable means for transactions, Ethereum explodes and actually flips Bitcoin. 
I believe Bitcoin will solve scalability, but if another coin comes along and does it first it could potentially leave Bitcoin in the dust. Why would anybody hypothetically use Bitcoin if Ethereum accomplishes what it sets out to do and Bitcoin's Lightning Network or any other solution is still months/years away from fruition?

It's almost as if a minor drop in price after a massive rally is actually a correction instead of a crash.

And the dumbest part is that the r/btc shills are going to act like r/the_donald shills and do a complete mental gymnastics 180 straight out of the 1984 playbook, "we've always wanted the lightning network!"
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:11:02
Because right now whether you like it or not crypto means Bitcoin and most fiat money enters and exits through it. The layman barely understands what Bitcoin is let alone any other altcoin so as it stands all altcoins are linked to the price of BTC.
Of course some altcoins can rally and crash based on their own news but the crypto space as a whole is like one tangled mess hurdling forward, becoming more efficient over time.
