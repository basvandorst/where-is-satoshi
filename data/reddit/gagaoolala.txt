Oh dear lord, please do not use any crypto as a significant store of wealth.
No emerging currency should ever be used to store wealth.  Assuming you live in a developed country, you she be keeping the majority of your wealth denominated in the main currency of your country.  There are a lot of pro/con arguments to this, but basically any non-sophisticated investor should go this route.  By non-sophisticated investor I mean basically everyone reading who is not a professional accountant or investor.
All cryptos are useful for daily transactions (as feasible depending on your local merchant acceptance rate) and speculation.  If you put any large portion of your long term investments into any crypto, you're not engaging in rational financial planning.

Since it's your own comment, I'll take your word at the intent ;)
But overall, yes, most people should keep a max of ~10% of their long term wealth storage in all cryptos.  The 10% can vary based on each person's risk profile and opinion of crypto's future growth.  I mainly know a lot of crypto bulls (which is a fine opinion to have) who engage is very bad financial planning because of that opinion.

So basically, you argue that the war budget is run off of inflation provided by central banks on fiat currency.  Bitcoin takes inflation out of the hands of central banks and thus the government, so the government has to pay the "fair market" price of war rather than the lower price helped by central bank inflation.
Does that really hold water considering recently low inflation rates?  I will certainly agree that moderate inflation + a strong economy provides political cover to engage in useless activities of the government (but a big increase in budget has the same effect in essentially any organization).  Consider the patriots that you mention -- will they really oppose a war if it is joined with a modest tax hike to make up for the lack of inflation?

The author of the piece might be a little confused about how the government "prints money".  It does this by selling bonds (i.e. debt)...  Also, when the yield on a bond is low, that means it is in very high demand.  The yield is the opposite of the price on debt, so low yield = high price = high demand

The former.  Without an authority for increasing the monetary base, then any type of fixed money supply will be deflationary in a growing economy.
I appreciate your argument, but I'm not convinced that it's very powerful.  Consider farm subsidies.  These benefit a very small number of people and cost a lot of public money.  I would argue the same situation is present in war funding, and there is no current mechanism in the US government to respond to this dysfunction, regardless of currency.

I agree overall with your quoted text.  Assuming that the Fed is helping to prop up war spending by increasing real inflation, then it makes war less painful.  I don't think this is even remotely the main cause of war and the war-industrial complex.

People could just start refusing to pay taxes now....  Likewise, the government could also just start forcing you to pay taxes in bitcoin.
