Ehhh, I've always been a bit of a saver. Bitcoin hasn't particularly helped in that regard, since I don't really spend frivolously as it is.
Saving doesn't make you rich these days though gents, it's all about being in the right place at the right time and screwing over others as much as possible.
@_date: 2014-07-05 05:58:59
Ahhhh, I finally understand. The BTC rocket it tethered to earth, and will eventually run out of fuel and crash back down. Good work, OP!

Yep, sounds like a great idea.
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:52:36
Litecoin used to value in harmony with Bitcoin though, just at a lower price... has it really fallen out of favor as the preferred altcoin, and is it doomed to fall by the wayside?
@_date: 2014-07-04 05:45:12


That's pretty optimistic. I'd give it a good two or three years, maybe more before we hit that sort of landmark.
It's all speculation though, so nothing's truly accurate. Hell, for all we know we could be compromised and a new form of crypto will take BTC's crown (unlikely, BTC is pretty damn integrated at the moment, it would take years once again for all to move to a different currency form).
@_date: 2014-07-23 00:04:17
Excellent, we make a fantastic gain but scare off prospective adopters with volatility once again! Sounds like a plan.
Also... seriously, thinking that it will go above $1000 by the end of the year, what a joke.
@_date: 2014-06-24 22:44:52
And it terms of massive gains, it will be the worst year. I doubt it'll bubble to even $2000 by the end of this year. The reason for that is because it's stabilizing and cementing itself as a more viable currency. A currency prey to massive jumps in value isn't effective for wide range use.
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:06:28
And yet there are still no services that I use that will take Bitcoin here...
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:00:37
I live in Australia mate, there's literally nothing here that I can use BTC for.
And apparently it's a "good" now, not a currency, according to the ATO. Which, as I understand it, will make businesses reluctant to ever consider BTC as a form of payment because they'll be taxed 10% on each transferal of ownership. The ATO literally killed it for Australia the other day.

Is that the delayed hyperinflation machine?
@_date: 2014-07-04 04:30:22
Bullshit. There'll be another crash down to $400 again in the near future, friend. Possibly even lower.
@_date: 2014-07-04 05:03:01
That's what I'll be doing as well. Keep in mind that crashes probably won't last long unless something is seriously compromised in the software - a LOT of people are going to want to snap up cheap bitcoins.
Not so sure about the Litecoin thing though. I feel like Litecoin doesn't have the potential that BTC does, and that if it were to go to the moon, you'd be best off buying right now. Can't really see it crashing any lower than where it's at already.
@_date: 2014-07-06 12:49:36

You're also getting downvoted - the miners aren't happy with your post.
@_date: 2014-07-24 09:34:01
Well, we have a government that actively denies climate change and is trying to install policy to remove environmental reserves and sell the land to corporations for short term gain, scrapped a reasonably up to date national communications infrastructure upgrade that would have paid itself off in ten years (replacing the outdated copper network with FTTP), scrapped an incentive on companies to produce less pollution and waste, and refuses to invest in rail based public transport for the sake of building more roads (even though they shut down the local car manufacturing sector).
They're also trying to double the cost of university for the average student, increase interest six-fold on student loans, and slowly privatizing the national healthcare system.
So yeah... we're pretty behind.

@_date: 2014-10-14 01:08:21
The worst part is, I don't even have enough money to buy.
That's okay for you holders though, as soon as I do buy it will drop to half its value.
@_date: 2014-07-09 06:16:53
The almighty dollar isn't the currency of the future, but neither is Bitcoin, and you're a fool for thinking that money put into Bitcoin won't be lost in the next couple of years. It's not going to magically grow in value like you all think it is.
The only secure form of currency at the moment is gold. So for the love of god, put your money into gold.

Don't panic sell when it hits $200 in October, and you'll be golden.

A show of good faith from Ghash... but when you have a PR department for a leading contributor in Bitcoin telling miners to piss off and move to another pool, what does it tell the public about Bitcoin as a whole?
@_date: 2014-06-24 01:15:48
1BTC won't ever be worth $10,000 though. Not unless the US dollar succumbs to hyperinflation and $10,000 in 2016 is the equivalent of $800 today.
@_date: 2014-11-13 23:46:59
It'll slowly dwindle down to about $320 again. I don't see any rhyme or reason as to why it should be heading up again.

Oh for gods sake... seriously, you're delusional.

Nope. I gotta feeling though, mang.
@_date: 2014-11-14 12:42:47
Because that's what it has been doing for the last three or four months. As of the moment, there's no significant new service, paradigm shift, or sign of any bigger investors in Wall Street picking it up, and as such, it's not ready for a dramatic upward spike beyond what we've already seen in the last couple of days.
Give it until next year. Then things will start to get interesting.

The blockchain will increase in size at a similar rate to the increase in storage technology sizes... there's no real need to prune it since it will pretty much always be a relative size to other data forms.
Would be nice for a poor bogan like me using some 8 year old legacy hardware though.

@_date: 2014-07-11 12:52:44
Interesting. The investment of gold companies into Bitcoin would make it seem like Bitcoin really only has long term potential.
Don't expect anything higher than $1000 by the end of the year, gents.
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:15:34
Pretty much what Palehorse said. I'd have to evaluate the value over time and see where it's going.
Buying some at $520 is looking pretty good, to be honest. Buying at any price now is good regardless, because it'll most likely rebound up to $800 or so. Not too sure about the rather optimistic $1200 again, but $800 is a pretty safe bet within the next three months.
@_date: 2014-07-13 10:25:16
According to some of the optimistic people here? Anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 US.
Realistically, around $640.

And despite all this, we've still hit the wall at $650. If you think we're going to get beyond that by the end of the year, you're kidding yourself. We'll have another recession yet. Then the time to buy will be even better.

I doubt that man. If the general populace in Australia is at all representative of the world populace, people aren't going to want to turn their money into what they think is "magical internet dollars". Oil is a dying commodity as well, since we've used most of it already. Precious metals are going to be big in the future. Precious metals, guns, food, and drinking water.

I actually feel pretty ashamed to live in this country these days. The last few years, especially this year past, have cast a huge shadow on Australia's international standing and reputation.
Granted, it is one of the best countries in the world to live in, regarding living standards and GDP per capita, but it seems to come at a cost considering fascist policies and bullshit regulation.
A great shame. Any potential of Bitcoin actually breaking into the financial industry is dead for as long as this ruling exists. You thought NYC had it bad? NYC's legislation doesn't even touch what this will do to kill it.

Finally caught up and downloaded everything, turned out to be 3 on the dot... cashed out a little bit, pretty much never been on a holiday since I started working nearly 10 years ago, and I'd like to go to Japan for a couple of weeks before I start a new job soon. I imagine I'll have to pay my dues to the tax office in CGT as well. But I'll be keeping the rest locked away for many years I think. It was a bit of a surprise, and I don't really have any great need for money now, so I figure why not hold on to it? Hell, might even slowly accumulate more over time and bring the balance back up to where it was. If BTC makes another near parabolic price movement again in the future, great. If it doesn't... well, easy come easy go I guess!
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:56:15
Roger. I don't have quite that much bandwidth, it is Ausfailia so I could probably get about 3MB/s on a good day, so it'd be churning over for probably a fair bit longer.
Will I have any issues with seeds and keys considering I'm installing Core on a completely different machine? Basically what happened was I fired up the old computer when I was interstate recently, then opened Bitcoin Core. It got stuck for a while verifying blocks, and eventually opened, showing a balance. I don't believe I ever transferred that balance out at any stage between that PC getting decommissioned and now, so I pulled the wallet.dat only. Just wondering if there was anything else that I needed or if I'm missing anything.

Do y'all see the updates if I edit the top post? Decided "screw it" and started Bitcoin Core a couple of days ago. I'm about just under two years behind and still downloading at the moment, and the balance I expected to see is (so far) still there. So it's looking good so far. Probably going to cash in two thirds and hold the rest until like 2025 or something. I don't really know if the BTC will see another parabolic movement like it has done before, several times, but who knows, may as well hold on to some of it hey?
