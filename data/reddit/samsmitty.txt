I'm not the guy you replied too, but I stick around just because it's interesting to watch. This subreddit can't agree on anything, and it's very entertaining to see the different people here.
Half believe BTC is an investment, the other half don't.
Memes and uneducated posts reach the top, a lot of real research articles get buried.
Everyone has their own prediction and calls each other out for being wrong. 
The delusion here on some things is astounding. Most people base their predictions on nothing at all (see this thread). OP dodges all questions about why he actually believes BTC is discounted and the currently value is higher than it is. OP makes broad statements like, "The stock market has zero correlation to crypto." with zero proof to back up the claim.  
So, I mostly stick around just because I'm interested to see what happens as a bystander. My normal investments do just fine and are a lot less risky.

Because the buying power of that Bitcoin is based upon the buying power of a dollar. The buying power of USD does not care what Bitcoin is doing. The buying power of Bitcoin does care what USD is doing.
You have to care about what it trades for because it's the only thing really giving it worth right now. Lets use a basic example. Say a cup of coffee is $5 and bitcoin currently trades for $5/BC. You can get a cup of coffee for 1BC. Now, say bitcoin currently trades for $1/BC. It now costs you five times more bitcoin to get the same cup of coffee, but the same amount of USD.  
Maybe one day you wouldn't have to care about USD and things will be priced in bitcoin, but in our lifetime it seems really unlikely that everyone will convert to a new standard that is so ingrained in our everyday life.  
You only get more out of it in the future if the price continues to climb, and nothing is guaranteed.

Well, yea that’s an obvious solution. But it’s not realistic even in the slightest. First of all, no business owner in their right mind would sell something ignoring the currency that 99.9999% of the population uses. Secondly, they would never do that unless they could also buy everything else in life with their bitcoin. Can they pay their mortgage? Can they pay their utilities?  
Even if they can, they are still in all cases using the USD conversion to pay that mortgage or utitilies. 
At the end of the day, the business only accepting bitcoin and charging a fixed price that doesn’t move when bitcoin goes up and down in USD value will be out of business because they are either selling their items for less than it cost them to get or the average person could buy it cheaper for USD somewhere else. 
Also. Are they going to be able to buy their stock in bitcoin, or do they need to convert to usd to do so? What about their supplier, are they getting the raw materials with bitcoin? Etc.  
At the very basic level, someone in the chain is basing their costs based on the national currency no matter what a few small business owners might try.

It’s my honest opinion that BTC can’t overtake USD unless we had some major market collapse. Even then, BTC might be valued primarily by the currency of another country. 
USD is too ingrained in everyday society and the vast majority of people do not care enough about the potential issues of a fiat currency to change their ways. Credit cards are just as easy to pay with than making a BTC transaction and they offer more protection that I just don’t see BTC offering realistically.  
Even in your example where you compare it to the cost of electricity, you are still comparing it to the cost in USD.  
The technology is neat for sure, it’s a nice idea that’s improving, but there would need to be a major collapse for it to not be based off USD, and even then I still think it’s near impossible.
Say that collapse happens in 20-30 years. Even then, 99.999% of people would probably not own bitcoin, so while more places might accept it, it wouldn’t be the primary currency and still probably be based on the inflating rate of the USD.  
I can imagine that maybe in some distant future, long after I’m dead, that there might be a type of universal currency that is similar to bitcoin, but I struggle with seeing it happen soon or quickly enough for me to need to worry about it. USD isn’t in the same position as a lot of other countries slowly failing currencies, and you have a lot of stubborn people that don’t want to change from something that works.  
I’m interested to see what happens in the future, but BTC has a lot of issues to overcome. I struggle to give up cash rewards on my card, consumer protection, price matching from my card, identity theft protection, etc. Also, I don’t have to worry about my currency dropping in value overnight or maybe climbing in value either but not knowing if tomorrow it could be worthless. I know a cup of coffee is 5 bucks. I don’t need to worry if that cup of coffee I buy today with USD could have been worth 7-8 bucks tomorrow.

To be fair, I'm not a fan of the interior design as well. It's not horrible, but doesn't stand out as something I would want personally. The minimalist approach works for Tesla, but it's just a little too much for me with that huge gaping monitor placed there.

Serious question. What do you propose as a better alternative to income tax and sales tax?  
Like, I never see anyone here linking to PhD Economists or other highly educated people talking about a real alternative. It's easy to make blanket statements like "taxes are bad. the government is robbing everyone". It's harder to come up with an actual alternative solution that could replace the current system successfully.  
@_date: 2019-02-07 18:07:36
It's easy in the US as well. If someone struggled to set up something as simple as a bank account, they are in for a rude awakening for the rest of their life. There are tons of banks with no fees, and sending money to someone else takes no time at all through my bank, and even less time with something like Venmo or another service. Even setting up an account for a minor is a piece of cake.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:49:35
Thanks for the response. It seems like a good idea in general, but very hard to put into practice and get enough people on board to make a dent in the currently accepted standards. Especially if the price continues to be volatile.  
Interested to see how things change in the future, but for myself and many others it's just too risky to get into compared to traditional investments.  
I, and I would assume most other people, would have a hard time giving up all the benefits a credit card gives today. I'll be keeping an eye on it in the future though!

He typically calls anyone who disagrees with him or has one negative thing to say about Bitcoin a troll. Doesn't matter if it's well though out, or you are simply asking him to provide some more evidence to his statements, you are the troll.  
I honestly don't get how he doesn't see it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:55:10
If you have to lie to others about your "investment" because it is doing poorly, it's probably not a good "investment".
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:28:42
Do you still think this was good advice? It looks to me that the 90% of people were right and "using my brain" would have cost me a lot of money. It's not fearful to assume it will drop even lower, and to wait till then to buy if you wanted too.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:09:38
It's not trollish to not have a positive outlook on the future of Bitcoin. You can think the technology is a good thing while also thinking putting money into bitcoin is a bad thing.  
Realizing you've been victim to sunk cost fallacy or realizing that the average person has no real need or desire to get involved with crypto right now doesn't mean their opinions are worthless. It's important to have both sides of the discussion.  


Most people buy Bitcoin to make money. Even the giant whales in the game. Very few people are in it just for the tech, even if they've convinced themselves of this after losing a lot. If Bitcoin is losing them money over the long run, most people don't have a reason to stick around.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:20:37


I get it. I really do. But, I think this is just a (sometimes) vocal minority of the people interested in it. Look how people react when the price goes up or down a lot. Then, look how people react when crypto technology makes an improvement. Look at the articles written in all the popular websites visited by a large number of people. They are mostly about the price of it, not the philosophy behind it.  
It's perfectly fine to be in it because you believe in it at it's core, but it's also important to realize that most everyone else isn't. The moment they begin to lose more money than they were comfortable risking, they are out.

Serious question, who has ever thought that Visa was too slow? Giving up a ton of consumer protections so your transaction processes in 2 seconds rather than 4 doesn't seem like many people would want to jump on that.
@_date: 2018-11-27 16:03:22


There are plenty of legitimate reasons to suspect that crypto won't gain a lot of traction anytime soon, and to completely disregard them is ignorant. It's good tech in theory and the early stages of application, but it has a lot of problems that you don't get with fiat currency or using credit.  
I've seen this same response at 9K, 8K, 7K, 6K, 5K, 4K, and now in the 3K range. People like you were literally screaming to buy at 7k+ and said there was no way it was going below 7K, and if it was it would never go below 6.5K, etc.  
You have to acknowledge the flaws of the system at some point or another and the many reason that the normal person has zero reason to ever want to use crypto.  
I mean, let's compare it to a credit card today. Transactions take longer, fees can be higher, taxes are a pain for many, no rewards, no consumer protections, volatile price, and the list goes on. Why would the average person want to get involved with that anytime in the near future?  
I'm not arguing that crypto isn't a possible future way in the distance or that the technology isn't good, but telling people they are a fool if they don't jump on it now is just plain ignorant and shows that you have blinders on to everything else.

People have goals. It’s possible he hit us around 17.5K. Plenty of people cashed out at around that time. If he was happy with where it was and had a feeling it wouldn’t climb more, it’s logical to cash out.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:26:08
I see these same comments every time Bitcoin drops. I saw it at 8K, 7K, 6K, and now at 5K. It's the same people making new accounts saying, "Now is the time to buy!". What makes this specific drop to 5K an opportunity and not just another gamble on an uncertain future? What is different about now than the last few major dips? It all seems based in uncertainty and is basically a gamble. I mean, how many people are accurately predicting the price over long periods of time? Every upvoted comment I ever see says "Oh, there is no way it will go below X. Now is the time to invest and be greedy!", then a month later it is way below X.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:12:43
I’ve sold stocks at a point where it was high and had hit my goal and never bought back in. It doesn’t always have to be a logical decision either and there’s no way to prove he did or did not sell.  
If he thought it was at a high and sold, it makes sense. Whether he thinks it’s overvalued or not at this moment is just his opinion. He never said he though it was overvalued when it was still climbing steadily.

Uh, I rarely post here. I'm not trolling at all. 


It's almost ironic the person posting about the promise of crpyto with zero evidence backing him up just said this, but...
Care to refute it? Looking at your other replies you are coming off as the troll. You aren't listing any supporting evidence to back up your claims. Only calling people idiots or morons because they disagree with your baseless claims.  
The reasons I listed are legitimate to any standard consumer, and I would love to see how you think BTC or any crypto plans on solving all the problems associated with it in the practical future. Basically, what will make the average person want to adopt a new currency system that is volatile and offers them less protection and less benefits?  
As I said, I'm not saying the technology isn't useful for many applications. 
Looking forward to an actual response this time.

Sure, it's not a perfect system, but I wouldn't bet on a corporation to be fair either or not solve problems they inflicted themselves. Thinking that a corporation or a privatized industry will always do better than a government run system seem naive. Without any oversight, it would be like a million mini-governments competing for as much control as possible.

Yes, this was enacted to help make up for the lost revenue due to decreasing tariffs. It wasn't enacted as a means to additional revenue.
This isn't the same world as it was in 1913. My question still stands. Show me a modern developed country that doesn't tax it's citizens.  
I can show you some that don't, and they probably look like 1913 America in the year 2018.

I bet you also take for granted the roads you drive on to work, the public schools you can send your kids to, the social security program that is helping millions, Medicare and Medicaid, Veteran Benefits, All of the government programs that help regular important industries (FDA, NSF, USDA, NIH, etc.).  
Yes, there are spending problems and not all of my tax dollars go to things I agree with, but I can in good faith continue paying into a system that is a hell of a lot better than what many other counties have. 
I would hate to have everything privatized. I don't want to watch an ad to be able to drive to work, or have to subscribe to certain roads. Get to work 5 minutes faster when you are an Platinum Ultra member. Get a fast pass past 5 stoplights a month! There are plenty of things that are much better under government control.

Source or are you spouting nonesense? I agree that it will be underfunded by the time most millennial retire, but it should be 60-70% based on everything I've ever read.  
I 100% agree that there needs to be better control of the taxes and how the money is spent, but I feel there are 100s of things we take for granted each day that taxes made possible.  
Can you show me one developed country that prospers well that does not tax it's citizens?

I 100% agree that the money could be used better. My argument wasn't that government is perfect, it was that taxation is not blatant "theft" and is necessary for a modern functioning society. 
Having the current systems in place, even if they aren't great in many cases, beats not having them at all. Hopefully one day it'll get better, but until then I'll support the current system by paying my taxes and being vocal about wanting change.

My statement was clearly a hyperbole. Look it up if you are confused. It was in jest based on how every other major corporation functions. Most, you would agree, don't act in the best interest of the public unless it is also the most profitable for them.  
So yea, I assumed it would be bad because the largest corporations haven't shown me anything that would make me believe otherwise. They provide great products that I love, but I wouldn't trust them to manage roads, police, fire departments, etc.

The comment I replied to was referencing all taxes, not just federal. To answer your actual question, fire departments, especially underfunded ones, regularly seek grants from the government to stay operational. Police departments do as well.  
So yes, your federal income taxes help make up for underfunded ones plenty of times. This is a good thing.  
Also, your taxes go towards funding the FBI, NSA, etc. You could consider them the big brother of the police I suppose lol. They can step in when local/state police isn't enough.
