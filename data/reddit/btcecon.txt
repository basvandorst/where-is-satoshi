You are assuming that people's only incentive to work is money. I disagree with that idea. Literally everyone I know that has gotten rich from Bitcoin continues to work on projects that help them find fulfillment as individuals. Me personally if I do get rich off Bitcoin I can start working on philanthropic projects that actually makes me happy as a person instead of going to work and doing things I hate. But I do see how what you're saying is very plausible in the long run.

Makes sense.

The technology sector, which is mostly a free market with very little government  interference and regulation, is the best example of money tomorrow is worth more than money today and that sector of the economy has been extremely successful... Iphone 4 and 5 were almost the same price at release, if you waited a year you would've got more bang for your buck...that's how Bitcoin works...If technology is growing faster than ever and it functions as a deflationary instrument why can't our money work the same way.

How is Bitcoin inflationary? The only way that's possible is if you bought it for more than what it is worth right now. In the long run it's deflationary.
