I don't have any crypto - was trying to get into it last month but having a nightmare with Coinbase, etc. 
Anyway, I see this a lot on this sub, what I don't understand is are you honestly happy with BTC ending up at $10 because hey I believe in the tech or the platform, etc.? I get the principle of it but seems completely disconnected from reality and common sense.

Who's the Bernie Madoff of BTC using that analogy?

But who will bail out BTC if it goes to nothing?

How do people keep track of what is affecting the price? Are there websites or places that try to make sense of what might be happening. Seems completely random to me which makes me cautious about buying. At least with stock market it's based on indicators, expectations etc.

But if all the major advertising venues are blocking crypto ads how do you hype for the next cycle?

Irony is if BTC price was closer to fiat values it would gain wider adoption and be seen as legit. This crazy valuation to $20k and now $7k has hurt BTC credibility more than anything else. It went from a true alt currency to a speculative investment

This is fucking disgusting. Supposedly they threatened schools as well. Fucking cowards. I hope these assholes behind this get caught and made an example of. Absolutely horrible
