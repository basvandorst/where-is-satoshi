I agree it's a waiting game but how come nobody is pissed off gdax doesn't provide a transaction id to look things up...it only has what looks like an internal "transfer id"

fairly new but maybe i can help...correct me if im wrong, but a cold storage wallet can be made on an online computer, which means the program or website creates a public address and private key...you just write your private key on a piece of paper and never enter that private key online...
so how do you transact if you don't type your private key online?
you use an offline computer to run your wallet (i guess you have to have a usb stick to download the wallet from online and bring to offline pc) and you transact on the offline wallet by "signing" the transaction with your private key. then you copy and paste the signed transaction info onto the offline usb key and then bring that over to an online computer and copy and paste that on the computer wallet to broadcast the transaction and it will go through
so your private key never touches the online computer...i think.
but still confused technically since your online computer can maybe put some malware into ur usb drive and then when you bring it over to the offline computer maybe it can find your private key if stored on that offline computer or run a keylogger.  and then when transferred back to the online computer maybe it can send it to the malware creators.
I don't really get how keyloggers or malware works...sorry for the poor english
