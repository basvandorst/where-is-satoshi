How hard was it really? I mean, your employer or such would set up the server for you, and all you'd do is download some email client like outlook, put in your server name and port, and you'd be able to send and receive emails. Right?
In bitcoin's case, there is no client and server. You have to be the server as well as the client, and have to do all the server setup work yourself, even if you just want to be a client.

@_date: 2014-12-17 16:03:28


They also don't know that wallet security is an issue.


They won't happen because people just want to sign up online for something like Paypal, they do not want to fuck around with setting up a wallet on their computer. And they want security, so if they put $100 in btc, they want to know that they'll always get $100 back or close to it. But because of the lack of a central authority to put a floor on the price, their $100 may well be $10 a few months later

This is making me nearly vomit, after seeing how many buzzwords are in that post, but none if it makes any sense to someone with a technical background, yet most people there are going to lap it up just because of the buzzwords.
E.g, the top comment talks about using idle cpu resources to build a distributed computing cluster bigger than EC2. But if the idea is to use those resources to mine magic beans, then those resources aren't available for any other processing. 
Also, the chips they are putting into these devices are ASICs, not general purpose CPUs. How will they be used for general purpose computing?
Also, as a developer, why would I want to run my app on a toaster? The more nodes there are in a system, the harder it gets to reason about it. In this system, if you're meant to run your app on a large number of small devices, that means you'd be looking at what, thousands to millions of nodes for doing simple stuff?
What about uptime and reliability? What if grandma decided to turn off her phone and killed your server just as it was in the middle of processing some request? Who is going to deal with all the hairy bugs and race conditions this would produce?
What about security? You're going to put your code / app on all these random devices, to be run by them? So they can easily decompile your app and see all your business logic? What if there's some OS level vulnerability, how will you patch grandma's toaster? How will you block all the ports you don't want open?
All in all, a really pathetic, and frankly disgusting pump and dump attempt. Ever heard of those quaks who use big sciency words to sell you their snake oil as cure for cancer? This is the same thing, except its using technobabble to get poor idiots to buy into this ridiculous idea.

If you're a site like amazon which gets millions of orders, and you generate a new address per order or per customer, that will add at least a few extra milliseconds per request, which adds up real quick and is a scaling pain.

There *is* no human intervention necessary in launching new nodes on EC2. That's how sites like reddit scale. If a site is getting too much traffic, a new node is automatically launched by making an API call by the software, without any human intervention.


No, the big question is, how will a software do that. The only way in which software currently makes money without human intervention, is trading bots doing high frequency training, or gold farming bots on WoW.

- Chargebacks are very valueable for consumers. Its not a big concern for merchants at all, there is sophisticated tech already available which minimizes chargeback fraud quite a bit.
- &gt;  the actual numbers IIRC are 12 transactions/second limit 
No, the hard limit is 7 per second, and if you do the math, its actually 4/second right now.
- &gt; Instant confirmations are possible on a number of ways.
Bullshit. Not unless you centralize.
- &gt; regular high-end desktop PC could easily and securely process more than 40 000 transactions per second on the Magic Beans network
That's only talking about the CPU verification time. It doesn't take into account a) the block time, b) because of block time and 4 txns/sec, your txn gets put in the back of the queue and you may have to wait several blocks for it to be processed, c) the time needed for a block to propogate across the whole network.
- &gt; actually you'd probably more likely use cash to pay for that. 
So even when magic beans is (in your hypothetical universe) taken over the world, I'd still pay cash? And no thanks, i do not want to pay for fucking dildos in person and pay in cash.
- &gt; storing of gold.
Gold is not the currency anywhere, idiot. If the whole world was running on Magic Beans, it would be an enormous pollutant which would massively fuck up the world. And its a highly inefficient solution which requires 100 computers with power consuming GPUs running 24/7 to do the job that could be done by one low end computer.
I agree that materials are wasted on cash too, which is why its a good thing that the developed world is moving to cash-less, credit card / smartphone based economy (and it doesn't require magic beans)
- &gt; for WU or PayPal it's for instance 7% from USA to Venezuela.
Absolutely false. Paypal is free for upto $2000 a month, more than that is 2.5%, or 5% in some cases for international transfers. Western union is a flat fee, $5 for $100, $10 or so for $1000, $30 or so for $10,000.
- &gt; The firms like PayPal, Western Union, Visa or MasterCard exist for the sole purpose of allowing us to pay each other
So does the magic beans network. Its purpose is to process transactions, and you do pay txn fees for them, which will only go up once there are no more coins to mine, otherwise miners will have no incentive to keep the network running.

Do I really have to explain this to you if you're a 20 year old veteran of enterprise software? Fine. Fire up an IDE and benchmark how long it takes to add a couple of rows to a database (to store the items in the cart). Then benchmark how long it takes to generate an RSA 2048 key. The first will take 1 microsecond (if using something like cassandra) to 2-3 milliseconds (if using mysql). If using SSDs it will be even faster vs magnetic disks. For generating a private key, it would be at least 500 ms - a few seconds.
It takes a whole lot more CPU juice to generate an encryption key than to add a bunch of rows to a database. You seriously don't know that?

Exactly. Think of all the ways that people would've been scammed, and with no chargeback or recourse, all the bad publicity this would've generated for Reddit.

All you had to say was it has had an increase in investment, and as I've shown you multiple times, there are a number of shitty companies / ideas that see a lot of investment, and then go to shit anyway.

You need to understand, at least, the concept of public and private keys and how to generate a private key. In order to do things in a secure way, you need to understand things more deeply.


No, it requires manual steps: generating a pub/private key, sharing key with sex toy site, calculating the address to send the money to, confirm address with sex toy site, copy and paste the address, send money to the address, wait hours for txn to verify, hope you didn't make a typo and sex toy site got the money.
Also, a new address per txn is going to scale -great- for sites that get millions of orders, and won't be used for DoS attacks at all.


Yes, there are good reasons why I don't want my boss to know where I spend my money.

@_date: 2015-01-04 16:57:34


Nope, takes hours. Limited to 4 transactions per second. Visa handles 7000 transactions a second.


And if you use magic beans, your boss can see that you spent them buying a dildo, as well as all the other places you spent them. I'd much rather a bank, regulated by actual, enforceable privacy laws, see where I spent my money rather than my boss.


[probably a positive if you were a robot] ( not so much for humans. I find it much easier to deal with 10s, 20s, 100s, etc.


Highly impractical to carry out in practice (and since you claim to be a CS student, you ought to know). Already the blockchain is several gigs in size. If it were to actually hold trillions of dollars worth of txns, it would require a data center bigger than that of google to hold it. Where does that then leave your decentralization? 


Yes, instead it pumps tons of CO2 into the atmosphere by wasting CPU cycles on calculating useless hashes.


I'll remind you again of the 4 transaction per second on BTC vs 7000 transactions per second on visa. Txns take ages to verify and *can* go missing. 


Sorry to know you've never been acquainted with a debit card.


So does BTC. Never heard of transaction fees? Not to mention, both WU and Paypal are a heck of a lot faster than BTC with its 4 transactions per second cap.


Because you are employing the services of an intermediary. Why should they work for you for free? (And even when you send money via btc, you're employing the services of the computers that verify the txns, and pay transaction fees to them)

No, because bitcoin itself is nothing revolutionary.

- P2P applications existed before the bitcoin network.
There's nothing revolutionary here. Its just mixing together existing technologies. And its extremely flawed. Only 7 txns per second while using as much electricity as the whole nation of Cyprus (and pumping all that CO2 into the atmosphere), while a single VISA computer can handle 7000-40000 txns per second.

There are legit reasons to keep a paper trail, to prevent money laundering and terrorism. There are also market research reasons, not to know data on you specifically, but for a company to know 'most of our customers are in in X age range, X gender, etc'. 
Regardless, you're in the vast minority, no one else gives a fuck about this type of privacy.
P.S with bitcoin, if your boss pays you your salary to your btc, they can now see exactly where you spent that money, whether you bought drugs or sex toys. Because all transactions are public. I'd much rather some nameless bank, bound by privacy laws and regulations, know where I spent my money rather than my boss.
I also work in IT, and if you think magic beans is more secure, you are laughable. There have never been massive hacks of banks of the type that have happened to Magic Beans every year.

They're paid by the merchant, not the consumer. If a consumer with a bank account wants a debit card, in most cases they just have to make a phone call to ask for one.


You said it requires making a payment with a specific amount / message


Lol, there you go. My point was, to sign up for bitcoin, you need to already have signed up for a bank account. And once you have a bank account, there's no benefit for you as a consumer to use Bitcoin and not your bank that you've already signed up for.


Like what?


Already have Paypal and a ton of other merchants.


The average consumer doesn't give a fuck about it. Remember, we're in a thread talking about how people want to be able to make payments in a super simple way.

Yes, the last refuge of a true believer when they can't counter any of the points. The other person must be a paid shill / sent by satan to lead them astray.


1) The merchant needs to understand https in order to setup TLS.
2) The consumer is not required to generate a private key. If they were, they would have to understand things a heck of a lot more.


The site you linked:
specifically talks about the payee and payer both setting up a new address via a shared secret. That means the merchant would have to setup a new address per txn and the consumer would send coins to that address. Setting up a new address isn't trivial when you have millions of orders, and consumer would need to understand the whole shtick.


The blockchain is public. Its trivial to find out which magic beans address you sent your money to. Its trivial to see that this address has no other incoming txns other than yours. And therefore follow the trail of the coins.

Cryptocurrencies didn't start with Magic Beans, they've been around for 20-30 years as well. 
The internet was only available to academics and researches for the first 20-30 years of its existence. Once the infastructure was in place for regular people to use it, it exploded in usage and in 6 years, it was already deep into the dotcom bubble.

Not instant then. If I send money to bob, Bob can't use that money to pay his rent until the txn is verified. AKA, not instant. Also, with the 4 txns per second limit, if it ever gained any amount of traction, the wait times would grow exponentially as well.


No, limited by the fundamental nature of the blockchain. The reason visa can handle 7000 txns per second is because its centralized and doesn't need to do the pointless mining to verify txns. 


You're not really a CS student, are you? Not even the tiniest cpu cycle is done in 0 time. Everything is finite.


Your boss knows where he paid you the money, and its trivial to follow the trail of the coins to see what you spent them on.


And do that 8 times if you're trading down to the lowest fraction point. Or, you can just do normal cash which doesn't require you to do currency conversions in your head.


Magic Beans's users are probably 100K. And of those people, they only use Magic Beans for a very minor number of their transactions. 99%% of the txns of most magic beans users happen in real money. So 1% of the txns of 100k people is 20GB. 100% of the txns of 7 billion people in ONE YEAR would be, how many petabytes? You do the maths since you're apparently a CS student.
Edit: Actually, 1% is way too generous. I would say BTC is used for may be 0.01% of txns of its current users. The only things its used for is drugs, child porn, and trades. That still leaves the 99.99% of txns which are carried out in real money.


Magic Beans mining does pump out tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. If it were to really become the dominant financial system, it'd be one of the biggest environmental pollutants.


Again, moron, nothing is unlimited except perhaps your magic beans air castles. And stores *do* have verification, except they only need to verify it with one central server, which happens near instantly. If you removed verification from magic beans, it would be such a hilarious, massive lol. I would send myself billions of btc from your wallet, and would be able to, since there's no verification. 


The consumer point of view is all that matters. You can also Paypal or WU to send the money where its needed instantly. Wire transfers tend to be done in one business day.
If you really had billions of txns an hour going through the BTC network, the verification times would be measured in days, if not longer.


First off, they aren't miniscule unless you know the internals of the system and optimize your txn in a way that lowest fees incur, which is the last thing anyone cares to do when they just want to buy something or send someone money.
Second, its common sense that as the mining rewards become lower, the txn fees would have to increase in order for people to have an incentive to continue mining.


Its not a percentage, its a flat fee. $100 is $5, $1000 is $10, $10000 seems to be $36, etc. *That*'s miniscule, and its future proof as well.


You're essentially asking for something to be done for nothing, which isn't how the world, physical or financial, works. The internet is not magic, it requires payment to your ISP. If you expect someone somewhere to run a server for handling your payments, you're going to have to pay their expenses + a profit for them, or they won't do it.

There are payment processors available to such niches already. And there are also fraud prevention algorithms which reject payments when the risk of chargeback is high, and those companies use them.


Like what?


What are they going to help with? Reducing blockchain size?
Even if you did all that, there's a fundamental limit of 10 minutes per block size. Right now it doesn't hurt due to low txn volume, but if the number of txns increases, even 10 minutes per confirmation is high, and most people would wait for several confirmations. Meaning you'd still be waiting an hour for a txn to be fully verified.


So VISA must be running their network from a garage, huh? 
Its not the volume of space needed to store a pile of hard disks, its keeping those hard disks online, maintained, and secured. Which requires a data center.

Most banks provide you with credit cards when asked. Its a matter of making a phone call or making an in person visit. They already have all your details so the paperwork required is minimal, if any is needed at all. E.g my bank sent me a card in mail as soon as I made a call.


When was that, like 300 years ago? But those banks provided a clear benefit, prevent your money from being stolen. BTC provides no benefit except to drug dealers and people doing illegal stuff.

You must have a shitty bank to get charged monthly fees, it isn't a problem for the majority of people.

Its just a legacy option that they carry out from pre-internet days, WU is hundreds of years old and they have the infrastructure in place to let you do agent payments, so they keep the option for grandmas who don't want to do anything online.


Then you can't prove it.


Probably because agents are often 3rd parties and each can choose to charge a slightly different fee. Regardless agents aren't necessary as you can do the payments online.

Bullshit. To buy something online, you can use your existing credit card / bank account. To buy something via magic bean, you have to go through the extra (and by no means easy) step of acquiring the magic beans.

In that case, it was a copyright company who used geolocation to tie an IP address to a residential area. The judge denied it because:

2) Some random person drives by my house, downloads child porn or uploads jihadi videos using my Wifi, then drives away.
3) The cops will raid my house since its my wifi that was abused.
What's your solution to that? Also:
1) A guy opens up his wifi to public using this service.

No dumbass, the agents are there so the receiver can collect the money.

You shouldn't be trying to discredit WU when you don't know the first thing about it.

As someone else just asked me in the same thread, I verified it, you can send $3000 to phillipines for only $45, which is 1.5% . Much less than any miner + exchange fees + price fluctuation.


This means what it says: If you send money via their website, you may be charged a different rate than if you visited their agent in person to send money.
