Your information might be a bit outdated as it's already operational on testnet3. If you want to experience it first hand you can try

The Bitcoin Lightning Network (you can play around with it on testnet3 with  does the same thing as RaiBlocks without requiring (yet another) altcoin. My bet is on Bitcoin winning that specific battle. Nothing is ever certain though.

People play beta games (sometimes beta for an eternity). Most Google stuff has been beta for ages. This is a normal and healthy way to introduce new technology and it will only help accelerate it's development.

Could also be 20 or 40. The point is that you get used to it, think about it and then act. Which is good advice for almost everything in life.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:55:37
Not at all. The developers clearly stated it's not ready yet so they are free to change whatever they want.

In the conventional definition "far lower liquidity" is of course true, but since crypto currencies in a way create their own liquidity, it's very interesting to see how this will all work out in the long term. It's all very new and nothing is either certain or boring.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:33:09
How would that work exactly? If I pay someone on eBay and I never get my stuff, how does multisig get me my money back if the seller doesn't cooperate? I honestly don't see how this would work without a neutral third party.
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:37:57
Without buyers there are no sellers. A lot of buyers want some form of assurance they will get the stuff they pay for or their money back. VISA and Paypal have transaction reversal covered. I am certain crypto will get this covered as well. Either with (a network of) independent third parties, or with something smart that somehow doesn't even require a third party.

A week? An hour! It might be interesting to follow  even if just for a little while to see how hectic some people make all this.

It doesn't get ignored. It will just take them 5 more years to notice it! :-)

eBay, PayPalled someone 92 Euro and got my first 25 Bitcoins in return.

We'll know if it's the yearly January dip in a few months. Or hours. This is crypto after all.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:49:01
True, but these high transaction fees are a temporary problem. It's not the first problem Bitcoin encountered and it won't be the last one either. All this is still very new.

I get what you are doing here and you have point. There is nothing magic about 1 MB, it could just as well have been something else. However Core made the very conscious choice of backwards compatibility. In other words soft forks but not hard forks. This means for example that old versions are still compatible with Segwit. They don't "understand" it, but it doesn't break them either.  It's the hard way to do it, but also the careful way to do it. Personally I prefer them to take the careful way.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:45:20
I would prefer them spending time on getting their shit together.
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:13:19
Lightning Network does not (yet) allow transaction reversal. E.g. if you pay someone on eBay and you never get your stuff. Others like UTRUST as mentioned before here claim they will solve this part of the puzzle for Bitcoin. I hope LN will solve this at some point as well as that would be needed to really compete with Paypal.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:17:34
It's completely transparant. You just visit a website and pay the fee. You can try it with  (testnet3). You'll never notice any channels. It's just a Paypal style payment system.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:38:40
A lot of interesting things are happening. I own 30 different crypto currencies myself so I am probably not one of your "blind bitcoiners", if those even exist. What makes Bitcoin interesting is that it's development strategy is long term. Lightning doesn't simple increase the transaction volume a bit, like Bitcoin Cash or Bcash depending on one's crypto religion, it raises it to insane levels. Elizabeth Stark compared it to extra lanes versus teleportation. The ability to do instant global payments for small amounts of money will open markets that do not even exist yet. 
And yes, there are alternatives. Nothing is ever certain. Some other coin could take Bitcoin's place. But with 800 people actively working on testing Lightning, my personal bet is on Lightning winning in the long term.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:14:02
I am having similar problems. They have a huge backlog processing tickets, I hope in a far away future they will get it all under control again.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:43:47
It essentially works the same as a non-segwit paper wallet. Segwit just means transactions are stored in a different way in the blockchain to allow more data in a block without breaking backward compatibility. I am surprised it takes exchanges so long to implement it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:55:13
Ever since Kraken became completely useless, Coinbase is the place I use to convert Euro's into BTC. I then use Electrum to store the BTC. I am not a great fan of Coinbase   but they certainly are a lot more reliable than Kraken. Once Kraken gets it's shit together, I am guessing 2140, I will switch back to them. I used to love them.

They seem to be the only exchange doing it this way. I use 10 exchanges and they are the only one where you can withdraw nothing while you are waiting (weeks, months) before they handle the ticket addressing your validation. I assume they will get it under control at some point but I find it amazing that they don't simply allow people to withdraw at least small amounts.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:44:51
Bitcoin has been around since 2009. So far it has overcome all obstacles in it's way. Nothing is needed "now". What is needed is good tested endurable technology which is exactly what everyone is working on. Did you actually try 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:47:42
Just sent you the 0.00002 tBTC, no idea where they hid the transaction ID in  but all this looks very promising.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:19:53
It's already operational on testnet3:  Some people are already using it on the main Bitcoin blockchain (which is not advisable yet).
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:15:26
It's not FUD. I have similar problems and I already received 2 apology e-mails from Bittrex for their huge backlog. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:49:35
Just play a bit with  and see what the future is like. It's awesome!
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:21:28
You're welcome. I get that you feel a sense of urgency, and you are certainly not alone in that, but personally I try to accept these things take time. Lightning is awesome IMHO and it will change the world in ways we can not even predict yet. It's amazing they created a viable way to execute micro transactions in real time on an unlimited scale with minimal cost. They took the time but the result is worth it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 00:37:10
On chain scaling means every node processes every transaction. Off chain with the lightning network means different nodes process different transactions. So on chain scaling is limited, off chain scaling is unlimited. As to using LN to block your account, that's actually impossible. You can always convert back to the blockchain and there is no way anyone can prevent that. This is an essential part of the protocol. You always stay in control of your own coins.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:51:32
Don't mind if I do: lntb20m1pdr4a4hpp5s2yn4zkwh7v949zlcrk04v9mv4pukky4wzxv5xpe0c40phkevh0qdz40v3xwetwv4exjc6ld9jzyw3z89jnwcmxv33rytty89nxvtf5xvmn2tfev9jnxtfsvg6nzcmy8yenzv3sxv386cqzysxe0l5rucd5r20e5sfp0c7ddf70c6yzmqkfdnmzmgj2etuuzdxv48llmym5w3shuq90k69gx55p0s22tlq6ttmx57e4m54c7sqclf2ngq8fjl3y

You are, of course, entitled to your opinion. Did you try  It does not require any downloads and allows you to experience the real Lightning network (testnet3). IMHO it is more user friendly than existing wallets because it focuses on payment requests instead of on wallet to wallet transactions. That makes it more like Paypal.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:11:31
Segwit increases the blocksize WITHOUT breaking backward compatibility (a hard fork). That's actually quite useful. And on top of Segwit's (slight) increase in blockchain capacity it also enables the Lightning Network to operate. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:07:30
I have been using and mining Bitcoin for over 5 years now so I do not consider myself to be a noob. I use 10 exchanges and I assure you Bittrex is by far the worst support wise. And they are not in denial over that, I already got several canned e-mails from them confirming the problems they are having. The result is that, like OP, I can not extract the coins I have there so I feel OP's pain.
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:33:32
I get the impression you have no idea how the system actually works. Instead of the "black box" you are assuming here, it is actually documented in great detail, like most cryptographic systems. For those interested in learning more about this technology, this could be interesting: 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:04:31
Unlike Bitcoin or banks it does not rely on a centralized database. It relies on an advanced mathematical method that makes undetected duplication of virtual coins impossible. So if I transfer money from my chip to your chip there is no central transaction. However once I connect my chip to a bank (e.g. to add money) it verifies if the coins I have on my chip are valid ones. All coins are anonymous unless I duplicate a coin. Then the coin duplicates can be used to identify who made them. Banks usually do the duplicate coin checking but in theory everyone could do that check.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:07:02
The original chain have been "replaced" by the segwit and the bcash chains. In a way there are only altcoins now. And many of the miners who agreed to switch to segwit also agreed to switch to segwit2x so we clearly have interesting times ahead of us.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:54:10
The beauty of it all is that the core development team has not that much power. If everyone switches software tomorrow there is not much they can do about it. It works the way it should with open source software. It's used because it works. If ever anything really better would arrive, it would be replaced.
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:04:13
That would have required a hard fork. They try to improve Bitcoin WITHOUT a hard fork which is smarter as it keeps all the old stuff and all the new stuff compatible.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:09:36
That highly depends on the size of the transaction. Once Lighting activates Bitcoin becomes usable for micro transactions. Something banks or Visa are not equipped to handle.
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:59:26
Dumping makes no difference. For every coin sold there is a coin bought. The amount of coins stays the same.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:06:43
The future is never certain but the [Lightning Network]( open source, just like Bitcoin, will enable very fast transactions for a very low fee. At some point the market is going to do it's work and this will replace transaction banking. Some patience is required though, doing it right takes time.
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:18:33
While that is sort of true, the same can be said of the American Dollar. It used to be backed by gold but that was long ago.

Morning, afternoon or evening? Makes a huge difference.

A cartel of all miners could do a lot worse than just raise the transaction fee. This is why it's preferable to have a lot of smaller miners over a few large miners. Unfortunately that is not the reality.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:37:36
If you truly believe censorship is a solution you understand neither FOSS (like the Bitcoin core software) nor Reddit. Censoring people whose opinion you do not like is always the wrong way to go. And even the mods know this. At some point Theymos et al even modded the theme to hide the fact that they were deleting comments.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:46:35
Why only ship to the USA? Bitcoin should allow you to sell all over the world as the transactions are irreversible.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:22:15
I have been using this for weeks already. It works flawlessly and makes most restaurants in Europe accepting Bitcoins without them even realizing it. And since I got my Bitcoins early it almost feels like a free meal.
