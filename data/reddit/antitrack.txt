From the article you linked to:
*Overall, I would estimate that a full attack costs in the tens of millions USD in infrastructure and electricity to pull off and get a full fingerprint collision in reasonable time. Attackers may also be able to steal or borrow existing infrastructure, like a botnet or supercomputer system. In other words, this should be within some Super Villain's budget.*

If it can't be used for something like that, then I am afraid its just another tool for the governments or banks to keep an eye on the people.

In the case of CyberLocker, some addresses are known  (showed up on victims screens asking for ransom). I have't thought about it, but how do we know what's spam/phishing and what not? Common sense filtering and tagging techniques might work, with the help of the community, just like it works for spam (most of the time with some false positives).
@_date: 2015-06-26 08:59:02
I might sound like a broken record today, but I would welcome of one if these technologies/companies proof that their stuff is actually useful by tracking down the CryptoLocker ransom payments, where they went, which exchanges or other services were used, and implement something useful to the community or community driven that we can all understand the usefulness of (ie. public filtering/screening, similar to spam filters in our email servers or clients).
And did I mention to find the CryptoLocker ransom payments? Somebody has been blackmailing the people via the blockchain since September 2013 and we know zilk about them.

Looks like a picture taken at the MaiTai Bitcoin event 2 weeks ago on Necker Island, so makes sense.

Thats a good question. I was asking s few days ago if there is any trace of where all the CryptoLocker ransom payments went. Time for an industry effort to trace bad actors?

Bitmine were known as makers of the Coincraft A1 28nm ASIC chip, which they planned to use for their own mining device.
Apparently they outsourced designing and manufacturing the ASIC to InnoSilicon in China, which (allegedly) stole the design and sold it to anyone that paid for it instead of delivering it to Bitmine AG exclusively. The Coincraft A1 28nm ASIC chip was used by many third party mining device manufacturers on the market at the time due to this "open availability". The reference design and datasheet of the chip can be found here:
Would be interesting if anyone has the inside story of Bitmine vs. InnoSilicon, and what InnoSilicon (China) is up to nowadays.

Slightly offtopic, but have we ever tracked the CryptoLocker ransom payments or is there an effort on the way? (I tried to google this a few days ago without result)

I was looking for a way to get my little money out of Greece, then I realized how bad the Bitcoin economy of Greece is. In other words, currently not really easy for Greeks to jump on plan B.

While they keep everyone busy guessing their next steps, they simply keep mining secretly ;)

Roger was selling a product called a “Pest Control Report 2000.” It was basically a firecracker used by farmers to scare deer and birds away from their corn fields. While everyone else, including the manufacturer, were simply asked to stop selling them Roger became the only person in the nation to be prosecuted.

I'd like to see a reliable source for that claim, Ravi Iyengar (Cointerra's founder and CEO) could also have been a 'travel companion' before opening Cointerra.

Blockchain.info often doesn't even respond to applications, I suggest to use the compatible API at btc.com instead - no need to register as far as I know.

There are pictures and videos of their immersion cooled datacenter on the internet. If you keep looking you will find it. 
For instance:

Interesting that this goes back to the Inaba days, before he was "officially" involved with BFL. 
I couldn't be arsed to look it up in detail, but I  believe that's at least the case with my PM that got released due to the subpoena (it was still related to BFL though, he was defending them already back then).

For those of you who use the ANX card for online shopping, what billing address do you use?
I am looking for a card with US billing address, not sure if ANX is it (I am outside the US) or if there is any alternative I could use.
(Some US based online shops need a US billing address and that often gives me some headache)

Also bigger than Google in terms of Megawatts in mining capacity. Let's see for how long with the current problems of all mining manufacturers and the Chinese taking over rather quickly.

It will be exciting to watch this happen, what 21 has planned and everything else BSS has mentioned in his talk.

That's a good way to look at it.
I believe the global weighted average electricity price today is below $0.10/kWh, since the majority of the hashrate is mining at places with lower electricity.
* China (using "subsidized" electricity)
* Sweden (hydro)
* Iceland (geothermal)
* Washington State (hydro)
* Georgia (hydro)
Energy efficiency is probably also lower today, for the majority. Most large scale miners are using newer devices, and the some devices offer a range of efficiencies based on input voltage.

In my opinion 21 could be (with the rare exception of Spondoolies Tech which is also run by serious people) the first real mature company engaged with Bitcoin hardware (in whatever form that will be).

Do you have a reference to these studies by chance?

It is happening, using 2-phase immersion cooling.
These mining units can heat greenhouses, buildings, schools, etc. there are also a number of supercomputers being built using this technology at the moment.

last time I signed a credit card merchant account, it disallowed giving rebate or discount on other payment methods. Hence, whoever has a credit card merchant account, can theoretically not offer discounts for paying with Bitcoins (or bank transfer for instance). Some merchants still do, but they are actually breaking the rules if I understand it right (only they know what they have in their CC merchant contract and most of the time unless they have a lot of bargaining power, the CC companies have the merchants by the balls).
Has this changed in recent years? I can't imagine...

You are on to something here.
Allied has been using immersion cooled Bitcoin miners to heat offices since the age of FPGA mining:
The latest ASIC based systems (DataTank 500kW) can heat greenhouses, buildings, offices, etc
It's not difficult to imagine smaller immersion cooled home miners are on the way, especially since Allied was acquired by Bitfury recently.
The advantage of immersion cooled boxes is that they capture 100% of the heat and they are silent, without any fans. A small home box could do without any moving parts or pump even if built well. So a complete silent heater that pays for itself...

Thanks. Forced change by class action, allowed since 2013 it seems and only in the US according this document and with some but's and if's. They got away with it for two or three decades prior to that :/
