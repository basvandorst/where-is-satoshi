Thats the dumbest most irrelevant shit I've ever heard. What does "buyer beware" have to do with the inputs.io hack, or the guy who had 301 BTC stolen a few weeks ago, or one of the thousands of other hacks that have undoubtedly happened?
Not to mention, for "thousands of years" humans have also lived by the fact that if someone screws you, you know where they live, so they don't screw you, AND transactions occurred in person where someone could inspect the goods, not through a completely anonymous system, where goods can only be inspected (if you get them at all) after the money is no longer possible to retrieve.
Feedback is bullshit on these websites, people can create 100 accounts in a few hours.
I bet this asshole is a scammer on silkroad or BMR, who else would be defending "caveat emptor" like this?
Also, someone has to pay either way, if its "caveat emptor" then people have to pay by wasting time to figure out who is legit and not, which means substantially less people are going to be interested in trying a transaction in the first place, which means substantially less revenue for sellers.

Yes, great idea.  I am sure illegal drug dealers on silkroad will be happy to have their silkroad feedback linked to their non-anonymous eBay account.  That will also work well when everyone connecting to the site is doing through an anonymous network.
Are you fucking kidding?
Escrow protects the buyer, but transfers all the risk right back on the seller, which goes against your earlier claim that "buyer beware" is the way to go for an anonymous currency.
