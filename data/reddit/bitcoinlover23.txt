I agree, crypto is in the real word! if you think crypto hasn’t proved something you need to do your appropriate research because people like me invest real money for real returns. like Christopher Columbus reaching shore crypto attracts so many people.

The amount of faith i put in fiat is immediately called into question whenever i say to myself how much i love bit coin. my initial investment of 3 bit coin wasn’t the perfect investment of others during the market boom i may have hoped it would be but it had already proved something to me, it was inherently valuable and my expectations weren’t just centred around making money. i was putting my faith in an amazing technology, the block chain. ive used bitcoin to tip uber and even make a few purchases but i can do that with money. i cannot have millions of fiat in my butt and feel comfortable but bit coin has accomplished a new way of holding currency in your home, offline and away from banks in anonymity. and the price of change doesn’t seem to scare me at all. Global adoption could be as smooth as butter. Hodling right up in there. bitcoin is the future. The price will go up and down but the true worth of bitcoin has already begun to surface.

If you would kindly look at my back cannon sir. this picture happened to come from an alternate cover of curse words, the picture you see is an unedited specimen which was not available on Google. You should look before you leap.------sauce:
