Desperate way:   
Step 1. Buy BCH while BCH on the rise.   
Step 2. Sell BCH while BCH on the dump.  
Step 3. Pray it happens as per step 1 and step 2.

Usually people end up buying at a very high price because of this. Stock is generally overbought by that stage. All technicals would indicate that it's purely a pump and dump coin, also technicals would indicate a sell opportunity. But because of FOMO, investors ignore all that, and end up buying, cos of you know.... FOMO on moooon....

Okay so I keep saying this and I'll keep on saying it. Bitcoin's biggest advantage so far has been...**first mover advantage**. This has created the major advantage for Bitcoin to date, therefore to it's holders.  
However, imagine as a new entrant into the cryptospace. The new investor or user has obviously heard of Bitcoin, therefore creates an account on an exchange, and goes to buy Bitcoin. Oh-oh. Problem. The user also sees the option to buy ETH. LTC. DASH. NEO. OMG (as in oh my god!) 'so much choice'. So what does the user buy?  
User is confused. User turns to Reddit for answers. User sees war happening between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. Oh-Oh problem. 'High fees?' 'Transactions stuck?' 'OMG' (as in Oh my god) 'stuff that' the user thinks. 'I'll just go ahead and buy LTC, or ETH, or NEO, or whatever'.  
Secondly, BTH, has some strong forces backing it. Unlike LTC, or ETH, or NEO, or the other million coins now on the market, they, instead of, just rolling with the forked chain as being BTH, are out with a vengeance. They want to *kill off* BTC Core and rename themselves as BTC. They are also promoting exactly the use case you have mentioned. BTH is aiming to avoid the problem of high transaction costs. They also have a few ring leaders who are trying to make this happen. It's clear as daylight.  
So what do? Well do what any good software company does. Create the best product that has the strongest market fit. Right now, Bitcoin, is not falling into that category. Or atleast it doesn't appear that way... cos you know, it doesn't have ring leaders out in the open.  
So, behind the scenes, are the devs working round the clock to make the best blockchain possible based on the original

In theory, currently, yes. However, over the long term, I'm not sure how that's going to pan out.  
For instance, Bitcoin is also known as 'digital gold'- it's value works in the same way as gold. However. Gold is finite. Not only finite, but you cannot duplicate it or 'fork it'. Bitcoin, can be forked, as we have just seen. Bitcoin also has very very close competitors. Gold is a tangible asset, you could literally take some in hand and sell it on the street. Bitcoin- you can't really do that.  
Imagine a scenario where the financial world around us collapses, or we experience another great recession. See with Gold you *could* possible sell it on the street.  Bitcoin-you *could* try and sell it. But then you could also be trying to sell BCH, LTC, NEO, ETH, by the time this happens, who knows how many will have survived in the future.    
I'm not having a go at Bitcoin, I'm clearly fond of blockchain technology, merely stating some opinions and some thoughts to reflect upon.

I don't think it's about being a fanboy. I think it's about being pragmatic and taking a sensible approach to creating good tech. I wish  the founders of BCH hadn't used such vile tactics to try and destroy BTC. I don't have anything against the tech that BCH is either, it's good, bring on bigger block sizes, create value, create a faster network, by all means, compete with the big boys like PayPal and Visa. But. Don't use defamatory tactics and destroy an existing tech (and at the same time confuse the community) that is still a work in progress, stands on strong fundamentals, and has a very strong team (as far as I can tell) working on it.

you can only have 2k drops once price is in the k's.  
A 2 k drop here means 20% drop approx.? Unusual in crypto i hear?
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:20:22
Good job. Not to say you shouldn't sell. This is crypto after all and there are obviously now political forces at play here (even if they aren't government level).  
But if anything, panic selling is what you need to avoid (as well as panic buys).

That's because for every bitcoin held, people got 1 BCH. Mate the tables would have turned much sooner if people got 1 ETH or 1 LTC for every BTC held too- without all the politics fuelling it!

whoaaa??? not even when the nice and friendly stranger on my Facebook group said 'this coin is going to the mooooon', i shouldn't have bought it???!! damn.

Thanks for the insights OP.  
The best thing you can financially do is be prepared for crashes. Have enough savings, because, literally, those are the buying times, you know, the sales. That's when you just go and cruise along, picking up some solid bargains. But you can only do that if you have enough cash right. Fiat isn't dead yet, and it's not going to die that quickly. Neither are stocks, neither is property, or metals, or, etc. You get the point. i.e. diversify your assets. Have enough in the bank and various other assets, that you could shop around with incase of dips.

Mindset and action are the key differentiators between a millionaire and a wanna-be millionaire. So he's right. If you're commited, you'd weigh risks, and buy, then you'd hold/buy/sell as you learnt. If you are a wanna-be, you'd weight the risks, and forget about it with no further steps.

They're saying you cannot fundraise through the use of Bitcoin, Ethereum or any other virtual currency. They're not saying you cannot buy/sell Bitcoin- as long as it's not for the purpose of fundraising activities.  
I'm guessing from this that China is regarding Bitcoin as an asset/property as do most other countries. It's not regarded as a virtual currency- that is the case with most countries.
