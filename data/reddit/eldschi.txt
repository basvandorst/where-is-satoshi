thanks, but i'd still like to know how the chances would be but i guess that exceeds my knowledge in statistics.

Thanks for elaborating this!

What exactly has been happening? 
If you mean selfish mining, can you proof that?
@_date: 2014-03-24 14:04:56
thanks! is there any solution to this problem besides mining for the small pools yourself?
isn't the whole selfish mining based on the hiding of a hash from other pools? how would that work?

so basically the government is fighting the drug lords aswell with printing money to devalue theirs! take that, drug lords!
@_date: 2014-01-24 10:25:21
What are the reasons, i'm interested to hear your argumentation.
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:21:53
i still dont see how that would proof that selfish mining is happening

Do you really think this guy is argument-, and money/lobby- driven?
Well written, well thought though.

i guess the author just didn't understand what BTC is, and saw something like some internet coins in various forms with various names, that's EXACTLY what it was like in the past where we had money in various forms with various names. HA, BTC is busted, because now it's different.

So you have a lot of money at stake but no knowledge about the underlying technology or no will to get to know it on your own?
That seems like a dangerous combination to me. I'd suggest you start with what bitcoin is and what the underlying technology is doing. There are plenty of good Youtube videos or blog posts that can give way more insight than most of us here. Start with the links in the sidebar and go from there.

Check out what the Lightning  guys are doing. There exist concepts that are worked out but sure, trust will always be an issue. For bitcoin, you have to lie trust into the codebase that it is bugfree so no one can abuse a bug and strip you off your bitcoins, the protocol and its design, although I'd argue that that's better than trusting people or companies. 
As for the off chain solutions, no one can tell right now what is going to be in the future. But you can check out different approaches and make up your own mind. Lightning uses the bitcoin built in scripting language to move transactions off chain and settle them on chain IIRC, other solutions want you to trust their network with the small sums you move (I think k.im does it that way). But in the end it's approaches, and though the Lightning direction seems better right now, no one can tell.

That's interesting to hear. I would never even associate cash with criminal activities per se.
Europe in general is respectful towards individual privacy I would say. And while imo it is a good thing, there are definitely downsides to that. Investigations into criminal activities take forever (see the Umsatzsteuerkarusell for example), you cannot estimate wealth of people easily for taxation, etc.
That said, the valuation of individual privacy is changing rapidly. Mass surveillance and police rights are extended continously.

Not the entire truth. While the majority of the German population prefers cash, especially the younger generation which I think is pro-tech and thus more open to innovations also prefers card. It is just simply not possible in some places to pay by card, especially if we talk about only a few euros.
It starts with being looked at funny when paying by card in the supermarket for only a few euros. But also when eating out its always a hassle because bartenders or servers often have to go and fetch the device for card payments...

But wouldn't the first miner that uses a quantum algo to solve the problem be able to take over the network if his hashrate is significantly bigger than the current hashrate?
And that would lead to a centralized mining economy just because quantum computers are not readily available to anyone?

"A world without banks and cash? the smartphone supersedes the wallet - fintech startups and cryptocurrencies like bitcoin shake the etablished financial system. the sector changes.
payment conference 2015 ......
cryptocurrencies - rising in approval
Seen in the in my opinion best technical newspaper in germany, the ad is for a convention about mobile payments from a well known company holding many talks about subjects from the tech world

Thanks for explaining in a short and understandable way!

I've moved some bitcoin to cold storage via bitadress.org plus got some coins on mycelium, do I need to do anything in case a fork happens?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:21:29
so when bitcoin overtakes gold in timescale, i will be able to predict the future of gold? awesome!

The current decrease in bitcoins value isn't caused by inflation, it's caused by regulations by the chinese government. They prohibit the exchange of goods for bitcoin and regulate the whole buying process (as far as i got the news, if you're interested just search this subreddit).
 Basically if acceptance grows and more people want BTC, the price rises due to the limited amount of bitcoins available. This is regulated by mining, where you can mine 25 BTC per 10 minutes, which inflates the value a bit. Does this answer your question? I hope i'm right. if not fellas, correct me!

You're welcome.
China has a very controlling government, and they permit chinese citizens to get only a certain amount of money out of the country. As bitcoin transfers are not tracable and/or show where the money goes (at least the identity remains unseen) they don't know what's happening and that's bad for the government. So they simply prohibit the use of bitcoin in certain cases (as far as i know it's not completely forbidden).
Aaaand there is the media with the whole bitcoin supports terrorism and money laundry etc. which is basically bullshit but i stays in the heads of many.
As well there is the thing that money equals power. If banks lose that power to the people who are their own bank (with BTC) they aren't pleased aswell, and try to prohibit the use. As you can see, it's all about power and who is in charge of the peoples money.

I don't know what's really going on, as there are many (and misleading) news regarding china. What i think to know is that the recent crashes are due to chinese people cashing out.
A bitcoin transaction is completely anonymous, there are several really good vids explaining it. I don't know in what extend exchanges are forced to report suspicious activities in the future, but i guess they aren't forced to do so right now. The regulations that you mentioned are getting harder and more, that's right. but on the other site the general acceptance grows aswell.
I would definitely say so. And right now more and more banks are trying to permit or prohibit what people spend their money on, as they pressure to close down some accounts, where people buy bitcoins for USD/EUR. That's definitely because they don't want to give their power (money) away.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:40:29
That's actually not the best strat. Just invest what you are able to invest, there is nothing good about having to sell btc for less then you bought 'cause you have nothing to eat 
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:23:00
I'll check that out tomorrow. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-12 16:31:55
there are other issues as well that could prevent people from spending Btc, like government regulations. consider that aswell.
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:48:08
Thanks. Now i've got that song in my head
