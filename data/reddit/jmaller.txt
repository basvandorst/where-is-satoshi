You could make a sidechain with litecoin's functionality but it would be starting over with a new genesis block...I don't think you could actually start working off of *the real* litecoin's blockchain...litecoin's miners and users would be in no way forced to start using this hypothetical (bitcoin backed) litecoin sidechain. So given that--I don't see how you could "port" their value in the sense that you seem to be describing. Their value is derived from the group of market participants that give it such, which is mainly miners and users (mostly speculators). 
In other words, you can't just make a sidechain with scrypt, 84 million coins, etc and then automatically it has value or it can port value from the community that is using the original coin. It will have to gain support from people who own bitcoin that wish to back it and miners that wish to mine it as far I understand it.

If someone is claiming they definitively know then you can bet that they don't. Is it too late? I wouldn't phrase it like that, a better question to ask yourself is do you think bitcoin will succeed or not?
If the answer is yes, or in other words you believe it will be used for more than speculation, then no it's absolutely not too late. If you think bitcoin will fail for what ever the reason or something better will replace it, then yes. 
If bitcoin becomes useful, in a pragmatic sense, these prices are peanuts. There is only so many bitcoin to go around for everyone that would want to use it.

I think that's a bit over dramatic. The proposal came out of no where, I think there is talk about 8 MB blocks now, I wouldn't be surprised if we see start to see some counter proposals. I'm also not entirely convinced it would be the worst thing in the world to actually observe how the market would react to blocks filling up, and if they would increase fee's, and if so how much would you have to include to get your transaction in a block immediately, etc. 
The media can make fun of bitcoin and release their usual bitcoin is dead--this time because it can't scale to more than 3 transactions per second etc, but maybe that's better than introducing new risks. Worst case you see how it goes and then you raise the limit if it seems absolutely necessary. Even Gavin admitted Mike Hearn's nightmare scenario of what would happen if blocks start to fill up was an exaggeration.

With regard to Mt. Gox, I agree it's more likely just plain incompetence, but:


That's an interesting theory, but I would add to it the fact that conspiracies are human nature and have occurred time and time again throughout history, on grand scales and on really small scales...so it only makes sense that people will theorize about them (whether they represent reality or not can obviously vary with each case). 
Have you ever done anything with a group of friends and kept it a secret from some other friends? 
Boom, y'all just conspired. One would be an absolute fool to assume conspiracies don't occur on all scales, they can be nefarious, they can be based on greed, or they can just plain be not wanting to hurt someones feelings so you and others white lie to them. 
Sure, there are a lot of tinfoil hat wearing paranoid types who might promote some wild theories on the internet, but that doesn't negate the fact that some of them actually represent reality...how many do? .1% of them? 1% of them? 10% of them? No clue.

Both "sides" need to stop with these conflict of interest allegations. Every one of the core dev's has some form of conflict of interest, but at the end of the day everyone wants bitcoin to succeed, emotions are high and there's a lot of debate, as many others have said it's a good thing. 
No way for anyone to totally eliminate their bias's, but I actually don't think is at all significant here. It just seems a bit childish at this point. 
It seems clear that every developer (except for maybe luke jr?) are in agreement that blocks can not stay at 1 mb indefinitely. I am confident some type of block size increase will be successfully agreed upon, ideally with some mechanism for further increases built in. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 02:37:44










Progress! Baby steps folks, baby steps. 
In response to the second paragraph, ya obviously other blockchains can have their own tokens, they are called alt-coins. There are hundreds of them, it's nothing new. The greater argument at play, though, seems to be debating whether or not you can have permissioned or centrally managed blockchain and whether or not that would even have any advantages, to me that's just adding an extra layer of complexity with no added benefit to a regular old ledger, or database. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:08:07


Who says they are not? Maybe they are not done accumulating and wan't low prices for the next few months (or some different time frame) in order to buy as much as they can over the counter. People seem to think that an investor would want to increase the price, they want the opposite until their bags are full, but if this were all true, at a certain point all the floating supply will be gone or it will get too crowded and the price would rise. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:43:20


I don't disagree, but I wouldn't be surprised if the markets do as they are composed more of big fish who care about things like the appearance of "legitimacy" whether or not the license itself is actually good for bitcoin from a practical standpoint, or if we would be better off with just the standard federal AML/KYC reg's we already have in place.

Not sure what to say to that, okay i guess i'm in denial. Gmaxwell and all the others that have been working on bitcoin for years and contributed all of their time, effort, and intelligence towards this project must have all just suddenly changed their mind about the blocksize debate the second they were employed by blockstream.

Also, any one else who agrees with them is probably secretly employed by blockchain.

I would highly doubt that, regardless of what you think of them, if they desired they could simply shut down the site and take everyones coins if they wanted, they're not going to do something like this for 100 bitcoins. 
To me there are two scenarios that are plausible, OP actually did steal the coins (I don't think its true but it's possible), or the gambling site is just totally making it up to try to get their coins back. 
The latter seems the most likely scenario, as 100 btc may be worth this bs claim for them. Anyway, btc-e is not making it up to take a measly 100 bitcoin, its got to be OP or the gambling site.
Also from the comment you are responding to:


Although this is a popular theory, it's not necessarily true, I seem to remember people trying to sell stolen dark market coins from Evolution on there, and they denied them. People were up in arms that they were making the decision as to which coins were okay for customers to sell, but regardless of what you think, this corroborates the opposite.

The event didn't happen yet, it hasn't been approved yet, who knows if it ever will be, so how could the market possibly have that priced in...but let's assume it has, the knowledge of an approved ETF is altogether different from those who would like to actually invest in such. Which would necessitate an increase in the underlying asset. If you think it's impossible institutional investors would be interested, check out the video from the bitpay engineer on the front page, but I guess you think it's impossible that there supply could ever dry up. Not me. 


Not necessarily true at all, it wasn't true for the last 4 bubbles and it likely won't be true for the 5th if there ever is one. Doesn't mean there will be. I am much more interested in Institutional interest at this point in bitcions life than avg joe interest.

(I highly doubt the latter could be true, if so that would be really stupid)

Yet, it will only hold true so long as full bitcoins have enough value to incentivise enough competition in mining to keep the network secure...otherwise satoshis, bits, full bitcoins all have no value because there is risk of them being double spent. 
So in conclusion, yes that's possible, if a satoshi represents a deed to a mansion then it could be worth more than a full bitcoin...but there is **no** scenario in which colored coins are being used and full bitcoin units themselves are not valuable.

That's the question of the year. A simple answer is that they are permissioned ledgers, or in other words one or a few trusted intermediaries are updating the ledger with some hashing algo only known to them.

I am already familiar with it, not an expert. But I still don't really see your point.

I would contend that it has been able to "export its inflation" ever since the world started using $ as it's reserve currency.

To you it's clear, to some others it's not. Every core dev has conflicts of interest. Who decides what's clear and what's not? 
@_date: 2015-06-19 17:32:38
Well, sure. There is a difference between the two scenarios you present but I'm alluding that everyone's intent/interest is primarily to improve bitcoin and move it forward.
You seem to be implying that core dev's who work for blockstream are primarily influenced by the desire to help their company. That's cool for you to assume that, but I don't see any hard evidence this is the case, or something similar with any other dev that does not work for blockstream. 
Every one of the core dev's is employed by various entities (or consult for them) and for the most part this has been the case since before blockstream. I don't think anything has changed, I think for the most part all of the dev's are good stewards for the protocol and maintain as much neutrality as possible. Of course you can't maintain 100% objectivity with such conflicts, but I think it's an even playing field and as a whole this has not had a huge influence over protocol changes. 
Most of these guys have dedicated countless hours to this open-source project with out being directly rewarded for it (sure you can argue they helped increase bitcoins value, and they all own some). As time has progressed now they all have some form of compensation through various means, but I don't think that means they all of the sudden turn into solely profit motivated individuals. I think they are all very smart and will find work if bitcoin were to just collapse or something, I think their passion and motivation does not stem from these relationships. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:42:09
Plenty of people, I'm just a casual observer who initially thought the blocksize increase was a no brainer. But there's definitely a lot of substance to both sides of the argument. There are trade offs at play here. 
I think Gavin has been an incredible core dev and just overall steward for bitcoin, but outside of him and Mike, pretty much every one of the people who really understand bitcoin seems to be against this. Or at least the initial proposal which sort of just came out of the blue, but I also get that transactions are getting close to the limit. 
I won't pretend I understand every intricacy, but one way or another we have to sacrifice something so it's tough to claim its a black and white issue. It also seems the argument is a bit political and economical. Is bitcoin a settlement layer or is it meant for every one's cup of coffee. I'm not sure, I think it's a very legitimate question, i have no agenda. 
It would be nice if every transaction could be on the blockchain, the question is, at what cost? It seems we have centralization in the form of off chain transactions, or in the form of less nodes for a gross oversimplification. Off-chain transactions suck and are against the whole point of "being your own bank" etc...but it's better than regulators potentially being able to enforce rules on node operators such as white lists/black lists. 
I also get the argument that there are just less nodes because of SPV wallets, that makes sense to me. But anyway, I just don't think there is an easy clear answer that proves one side is totally right. I enjoy the debate and proposals, it's fun to watch it all evolve in front of our eyes. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:36:06

Until fees are $35 for a transaction and settle in 3-5 days (bank transfer) or 10-20% for large transactions (WU) I think the poor world citizens would still benefit from bitcoin. Not to mention that anyone who can do math and connect to the internet can use bitcoin as opposed to the required documentation needed to create a bank account. And banking infrastructure. 
Edit: If you are referring to it for remittances, but I see you mention storing their wealth, not sure why they would care about the fee's if that was their intention.

The psychological progression of the media slowly realizing the truth is awesome to watch, we have all probably had these thoughts  in our head when we were skeptical of bitcoin and then had to gain a better understanding of how bitcoin really works and what gives it it's advantages in order to realize why its pretty pointless to create a centrally managed ledger, or at best such an attempt is just unrelated to bitcoin what makes bitcoin special and new. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:31:49
Once again, I acknowledge there is a conflict of interest, as there is with every other core dev. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 14:09:04


I was under the impression it basically meant, higher price levels. 


As you have stated yourself, it is increased demand for the $. Does that in it of itself guarantee stable price levels when supply is increased? No, there is the velocity of money, but it is a contributory factor. 
Let's define "exporting inflation" so we are on the same page, when I refer to that I basically mean that the quantity or supply of money (one variable that can affect inflation) has less of an effect, as there is more demand to support it. Again, I'm not ignoring there are other variables such as velocity or a willingness to spend. 


To who? For every seller there is a buyer. Who are the most likely buyers?


So, you are suggesting that, importing becoming more expensive, has absolutely no relation to price levels? They are two totally independent variables that have zero effect towards each other? 
@_date: 2015-06-03 13:26:12




But...is the ledger truly immutable if a third party like ripple can and will be forced to reverse certain transactions (or face another penalty from Fincen)? 
Or more generally, it sounds great to link blocks of transactions with hashes to create the appearance of "immutability", but if there is no competition--or in other words the hashing algo is secret and known by one party, would it not be trivial to change the ledger if need be and 51% attack yourself to make the ledger what you want it to be? Or really 100% attack? To use similar bitcoin semantics. 
Obviously banks like that they can reverse transactions, and I'm not even saying reversibility is inherently bad...but this is the power banks already have, how does a blockchain add benefit? 
Maybe it does slightly, if so it will just make their communication a bit more efficient, nothing game-changing. There will still be costs to use this network and you must be a trusted member of this theoretical network like the current ones.

We can go back and forth all day, but I think it comes down to the fact that you are suggesting a "strong" dollar, or relatively stronger exchange rate, is totally independent from domestic price levels, where as I am not. I think they can influence each other. Like most things it's not a simple relationship, there are many variables. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:33:13


Actually, *my* comment was that I hope those $ never find their way home in response to the original comment which talked about how the US can export it's inflation. So, obviously I didn't present any argument for that, there was no reason to. But I do agree that it does. Then, I was responding to your comment and trying to find out what exactly you were making fun of it for.


Right here: 


You also mention:


Yes, that is also true, but it is not the sole implication of having excess demand for $ from the rest of the world. There are a bunch of implications that stem from this fact, such as how increasing cheap credit into the economy (separate from the fed's entry into the bond market) will not necessarily influence an increase in prices. 
Sure there are other factors in play, such as the velocity of money, etc, but I don't see how it's really debatable that increased demand from around the world is one form of "exporting" inflation. One can simply ask themselves, if this demand did not exist, would higher inflation in the US be more probable? 
Maybe your main point is this:


That's all good and well, and positive for the US, but it is still increased demand for the $. When I say "find their way home" I don't mean in the form of investment, I obviously mean because no one wants them globally. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:17:44
Hmm a lot of assumptions, I don't know what's here for long but I have been following bitcoin since the beginning of 2013. Yes I know it has been going on for years in a way but see Greg Maxwell's comment in this thread. That's more what I was referring to. 


Not sure what to say to that, don't see how it would be purposely breaking bitcoin to see how the fee market works under these conditions. If there was consistent unendurable delays then you implement a higher limit and consider it a bank holiday.

This is a ridiculous argument. I don't know what combination of solutions will be implemented and on what time frame but I think most people seem to consider "scaling" to mean maintaining for the most part totally free transactions, so in other words, they think bitcoin needs to compete with perfect. Nope it needs to compete with 3-5 business days and a $35 fee and shit like that. 
The reality is that with orders of magnitude more people using it, it would still very likely still be much cheaper/faster than a bank transfer to another country, or a WU transaction...so I don't agree. 


Maybe it's undervalued, maybe it's overvalued, but it has nothing to do with your subjective gross oversimplification of the value of a bitcoin.

To take 2% of each paycheck in bitcoin would be delusional? Some people take a very small portion of every paycheck and invest it...this option would just save them the trouble as well as promote/encourage companies to actually hold/keep a small amount of bitcoin on hand. 
Sure, I am talking mostly about people around here but options like this help average people start to consider getting their hands on some coin, while it is getting easier and easier to buy through services like coinbase--buying bitcoin can be a bit intimidating--this would soften the blow. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:31:15
That's fair, I agree with that--but it would likely just be an option to have a sliding scale, the vast majority of people using this option (and yes I am sure not many would at first) would likely use very small %'s. If some people want to be insanely risky let them go for it they wouldn't be the first. 
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:10:12
Both are great, and you can't really have one with out the other. People speculating on bitcoin as a store of value gives it the liquidity needs to be used as a payment system. 
It's like gold but better because with out sacrificing it's greatest characteristic of scarcity, it provides better utility in the form of portability/divisibility and not being able to counterfeit it. It's like a payment system but better because it is a digital (decentralized) form of money that has no need for a third party (which introduces costs/frictions) to use it as a payment system.

I'm sorry if this is too bitcoin fanboy for you, but personally I cringe when I see the doomsday posts on the days where the price is down...I tend to ignore this sub more on those days...I was just trying to counteract them and present my opinion. 
I'm not sure where you are coming from or why you seem to feel offended, maybe you think this sub should stick to things strictly about the tech etc...that's fine, but like it or not (and I don't see why you wouldn't like it) new users are slowly taking an interest in bitcoin.

I agree with all that but:


What's the difference really? When I say I own 1 bitcoin doesn't that just really mean I own a wallet (or to get technical the private key(s) to send funds from the collection of addresses in the wallet) which contains unspent inputs that total 1 bitcoin? 
So, if I spend those inputs to a wallet that CV is tracking, can't they then track the following outputs from this point on? Unless of course I mix them or use some other tactic after I send them again from the CV tracked wallet--but then CV knows I am trying to conceal where I am sending my money and has my information to give to gov'ts?

So people actually have to research what they are investing in and exercise their judgement? Sounds scary to me. 
And they will be taking a risk to get a reward? Even scarier. Sorry but there is no reward with out taking risk, it's the basis of entrepreneurship. If you are investing bitcoin (something already risky that you should only risk as much as you can afford to lose) into even riskier projects with out understanding you are taking a humongous risk...you will get exactly what you deserve. 
Blockchains/Bitcoin does not replace society with a grand utopia, it simply takes away all the abstractions of modern banking/regulatory capture and replaces them with cryptographic trust. It provides a fair way of doing things of which all the participants voluntarily agree to and can understand.
As far as denting confidence in the market place as a whole I don't really buy it, Mt gox is the exception which was outside of the security of the blockchain and tradional regulation, these types of entities will not exist much longer if not already gone. Proof of solvency/multi sig are takign away the power, and basic aml/kyc procedures are pretty much the standard for exchanges.

It's not only an investment, and yes the price took a beating this year, it went from $13 to over $1000 the year before. That's a nice narrative, I don't think it needs to be fit into boxes though, it's something totally new. 
@_date: 2014-12-24 03:06:14
I'm not really sure what this post is about, this is a big community and I am sure there are people who go to far but I don't think it's the norm. There is a difference between what you are talking about and tipping someone a $1 who can easily just ignore if they want. To me that is fine, they get free money and can experiment a bit or they ignore it. 
Also, plenty of people post in this sub who are interested in bitcoin, so we try to help them out and point them to good resources to learn about it etc. But I don't think thats what you are talking about either. In terms of asking companies to accept it, I guess I agree with you, but I also could care less if people pursue that, it doesn't hurt anything if they do. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 16:40:59
Yes, I am prob 10x more confident in bitcoins ultimate success today at these prices then I was when bitcoin was over $1000, there is just too much momentum on all cylinders and I am fascinated by the rate of change. Everything reinforces everything else and its fun to watch, the price will come eventually. 
People are so blinded by the price, I guarantee those same people would be so optimistic if the price was high and nothing was really going on in terms of development, start-ups, etc. I guess it's tough to see through the fog when your money is involved, but if you look at things objectively it's not really debatable how far we have come in the last year or so. 
If the price was this low because of some flaw in the fundamentals, or intellectual capital fading I might be a bit more worried, but this is just bitcoin being bitcoin. The market is not and has not been liquid, this will get better when the market matures and increases to a value more appropriate for a global currency/payment system. To me, there's really no scenario where bitcoin is here to stay and it's only worth hundreds of dollars, and every day it's becoming more and more apparent that bitcoin is here to stay.

Everything about this guy gives me a bad feeling, this is probably why they call themselves a personal finance company that takes advantage of emerging technologies and all that bs rather than a bitcoin company, b/c when the right time comes he is going to fork bitcoin and introduce gov/coin and sell it as the protocol of the big boys. 
It will be a glorified paypal, NSA/gov coin that destroys the fungibility of bitcoin and turns it into a good way for middle-class people to do shopping rather than helping someone in another country who can not get a bank account. 
As a community, we should be very weary of Jeremy Allaire and Circle, it just seems like he has had something up his sleeve ever since he got involved, and he seems to think that we need his help to succeed or else we are done for.

I think there is nothing wrong with "Hodlers", and/or speculation, it provides a very useful function of increasing liquidity. Some people think bitcoin would work just as well at $1, I don't think that holds true, as if you want to move large amounts of money using the payment system you need a higher market cap. Hodling helps this if you are okay with the risk/reward.
But I think there also seems to be a misinformed attitude that to use bitcoin you must invest in it, I would like to see tons of people buying $10 to tip and play around with. If they feel like investing and understand the risks that's great too.

@_date: 2014-07-08 16:28:58
I agree, but its important to note that at some point in the future there will be attacks like this on bitcoin--whether from a terrorist actually using it--or from a gov't attempt to discredit bitcoin. We must remember that bitcoin is simply a tool, so as long as there are bad people in the world it will inevitably used at some point for something bad.
Many people easily forget that terrorists already use cars, the internet, and cell phones, so lets keep things in perspective. 
Also, they already use the tool of money, so if bitcoin becomes wildly successful, they will likely use it as well (yes I know it is a public ledger, so this would be stupid, but someone will do it or a gov't will claim they did, but also there are ways to use it anonymously--which is great and necessary for anyone who values privacy). 
When this happens, we must stay strong and remind ourselves that as money or a currency, bitcoins purpose is not to prevent bad things from happening--as no currencies before it have, but rather to be FUNGIBLE as this is what makes a good currency. 
It would be pretty nuts to not think twice at all the horrible things that happen daily using traditional currencies--but to create a shit storm--the second something bad happens with bitcoin. But the reality of the situation is that there are plenty of incentives for gov'ts, certain institutions, and other parties alike to spin this narrative in a way much differently than the truth. The best currencies do not care about the people who are using them nor their intentions or actions, they are simply neutral.

"In other words, this is what they said: X amount of Blabla coins were traded, which at the time that trading stopped were worth $10. Now they're worth $1.000. So, we conclude that they traded X times $1000 in value. "

lol nope, simply that terrorist financing (when it mattered most) was apparently "of little practical significance" but when they can claim bitcoin was involved in any way, shape, or form on a much smaller scale in some sort of terrorist attack--bitcoin will be scrutinized like crazy and the pitchforks will come out.

Not me, Ill throw you an upvote that's a great response. Fair, in my defense I can't control who upvotes me and was not expecting to make the front page let alone the top. 


I totally agree, I would rather see it increase because of those reasons as well. Personally I think we are track for that, but time will tell. 


I'm a bit skeptical though that these posts or the actions of avg die hard bitcoiners who keeps buying a coin or two or even 10 when the price falls really have any significant impact on the market. If it did we would be on "the moon" by now lol. But yes, I would love to see some real use-cases and actual adoption. When I first learned about bitcoin, its potential, etc, my outlook was really 5-10 years and still is, so to me in my biased perspective we are moving faster than I had expected (or at least on track) in terms of reaching some sort of cricital mass, and it can be overshadowed by the beating the price took this year, but this is all just conjecture.

I am also really interested in--if this applies to simple third party wallet providers like blockchain, mycelium, or green address, as if it does I don't see how anyone will continue to use them as opposed to open-source wallets that will not require this. These companies should have people actively fighting this proposed regulation as we speak (I would hope) or they will lose all of their customers I would imagine--posted about this here:
Further, the aspect that claims they can not keep profits or retained earnings in bitcoin (which is insane), aren't all of blockchain.info's profits in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-10-23 04:22:44
Well, if Litecoin miners would have to choose, that seems to suggest to me there would be the option of a fork, so to me, which ever network retained the ASIC's that are currently mining Scrypt would be the only network worth using. So, in my limited understanding, that would mean people holding LTC would not even see the effects of this? Or really, I should say, they would have to either download some new client of the updated software, or the miners would reject the fork?
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:03:56


Sounds about right but it should be noted that there were very similar attacks on it, but education and use slowly helped the masses realize how important this tool was, we must do the same with bitcoin. It is simply an extremely useful tool--nothing more--until there are no bad people left in the world--tools will be used for both good and evil.

Interesting, how would it work though, would it be basically a side-chain version of it that is functionally the same as Litecoin, or would there be some sort of a hard fork for Litecoin miners?

@_date: 2014-07-04 16:30:16
Please expand upon the flaw in my logic? Unless you are implying that all alt-coins are dead in general, which is possible but unlikely, litecoin is doing exactly what it did before it sky-rocketed from $2 to $48. Now, I would be a fool to assume history will necessarily repeat itself, but I think it's also foolish to assume it is dying--as it is behaving no differently then in the past--it always lags a bit from bitcoin and then has wilder swings despite what certain people's uninformed tweets might suggest, cough cough barry silbert. Possibly because many traders are converting their litecoin to bitcoin for the anticipated big run up in price, but then when things cool down they switch back for the big litecoin pump. 
In fact I think it will likely drop even further maybe to the $4-$5 range potentially before it reverses its trend. We could talk about the fact that newly created ASIC miners are not yet widely distributed enough, and how many are cashing in their litecoin to recoup their initial investment in these miners--creating temporary selling pressure on the price, but I am no goru I can only speculate, but I think to say it is dying is a bit premature.
I actually don't think there is anything so special about litecoin protocol other than the faster confirmations, but it is hard to boot-strap a coin from nothing into as strong a mining network as litecoin has become. Would you feel comfortable sending a large amount of money over any other network besides bitcoin or litecoin at the moment? I wouldn't. And I don't think it's crazy that more than one payment network can exist personally. Not to mention increased liquidity from the biggest market in the world China, and the many $US crosses on various exchanges--although other coins seem to be getting this now.

Look man, some people see things as they are, and some see them for what they have the potential to be. 
You see bitcoin and compare it to existing payment systems, etc and nitpick on things to create you own narrative as to why bitcoin will never succeed, I'm sure you would say the same about me conversely. Maybe I'm caught up in the tulip mania and it's gotten to my head. I really don't think so. Your attitude basically precludes you from seeing potential. 
Thats fine. Best of luck to you. I think bitcoin is here to stay. This conversation is of no added value to me, so i'll leave it here. I'm not going to try to convince you of anything because its simply not possible. So why should I try? 
Also, your point about arbitrage is a good one. But its in the past, and the willy report was never fully validated. What I do know is the Willy bot for sure had no impact on the price increasing to $700 this past summer, and none on it deflating back down in recent months. The markets have moved on.

I think any comparison to Gox is a bit much--there is a difference between thinking of ways to not let people withdraw their money because you don't have it and being overly (and competely unreasonably) cautious and requesting too much information from customers because you are liable to insane governments that do not understand bitcoin. 
The fact that they are operating in a highly scrutinized space that is tryign to implement the same onerous regulations that the big banks get is not my problem though. Further, it is crazy to say customers are verified and then ask for all these ridiculous froms of evidence like source of your coins or anything like that ONCE THEY ARE ABOUT TO WITHDRAW and hold all of their coins hostage, and I have written to them about this as it as unacceptable.
But i mean, Bitsamp has been on its game from the start, do you really think the situation is anything like Gox? I certainly have no doubt they have proper cold storage/security procedures etc. I am 1000 times more worried about them being overly-cautious due to their funding from big VC's and investors than any type of gox situation.

I am certainly not an expert on the topic, but I would love for some people who are to put together a good comparison of sidechains and treechains and their pros and cons. 
I am not sure if I totally understood it, but one of Peter Todd's criticisms was regarding the settlement of bitcoin back into the main chain from a side chain and how there is a lot of potential for attackers to kind of distort the sidechain which could alter the bitcoin that is "set aside" as a backing for each side chain. Sort of like, creating fake receipts for the gold in a bank's vault but rather compromising the side chain to do so. He also seemed pretty worried about the scaleability of side chains with regard to Merge-Minging, more specifically, whether or not miners will be incentivised enough to actually mine all of these side chains (and set up nodes for them?).
That being said, I am a laymen, and it would make sense he is biased towards his proposal. So, I am curious to hear from people who know more about this and debate it.

What is a full bubble pop? We already flashed down to basically the high of the last big increase in price ($266). MT Gox has been around since the beginning of price discovery really, so you could argue that they had Willy going as far back as you want. 
But, lets say all of this was actually proven true, would it change the security of the network? Would it change the number of developers working on bitcoin? Would it change the potential use cases that bitcoin can provide? Would it change the amount of Capital invested in hundreds of start-ups and those employed by them? Would it change the number merchants accepting bitcoin? Etc, etc. So, I really don't see how this evidence would affect the price as much as you claim, I could see it being used as a tactic to create panic and maybe successfully but when things cleared up the market would realize that nothing has changed, and if anything the system is more resilient/liquid now then it was before with out the bottle neck of MT Gox.

1 moonsuit ...I love your ambition, but be careful though, there are some savvy traders out there and this market is not easy. 
If you are going to do so, set aside a certain amount to trade that you are comfortable losing, it's easy to get into the mentality of risking more and more to cover your losses until before you know it everything is gone, or a lot more than you intended to risk. This is not meant to discourage you, just a word of caution. I speak from experience (in terms of risking a lot more than I originally intended to). 
Also, just remember, there are fees for every trade, so in reality if you are breaking even on a trade, you are really losing. Take this into account. Also, in terms of picking the trades correctly in your head--just know in practice it is sometimes harder to execute than you would imagine. If you are not quick enough to the trigger (since the market is so illiquid at this point in time) volatility and slippage can cost you. The market can move very fast on you, and just a tad of indecision can cost you a lot, as you will end up selling at the bottom of a movement or buying at the top.

Mathematically bogus? heh? I didn't really mean to insinuate anything mathematically, I just threw out a number, simply meant to demonstrate it's not about those who *already* have good banking or stable currencies, and I think we can agree there are a lot of them out there. 
And I am not saying they are ready to "jump on" most don't even know what bitcoin is, and may not be ready for it. Although there are some ready right now possibly in places like Argentina.

What can Litecoin do that Bitcoin can't do? I see it more as a compliment to bitcoin, that sort of acts as a hedge against btc transaction fees getting too high. Also, an alternate store of value, like silver. Could you implement scrypt on a side-chain? Seriously asking, I assume not but I'm ignorant on the topic. 
But yes I agree most alts aim to do that, but haven't really gotten any traction, aside from an initial pump and dump, as a good amount contain features that could be implemented in bitcoin.

If you wan't to invest in a commodity or asset (in this case the units of the ledger) you must buy them from someone else or produce them ideally at a cost under the market rate. That's how they work. But I guess cause you saw some people on reddit that you considered to be pressuring others to buy them, and that must make the concept a get rich scheme. Some people think chocolate will be hard to produce in the coming years, and pressure others into buying it i.e. chocolate is a get rich quick scheme. 
Yes this analogy leaves out the part that how the ledger works can be hard to understand, but some times it takes time to understand something before you invest in it. As opposed to telling people, invest now, research it later!! 
@_date: 2014-12-23 19:14:09
Yes I added it after, sorry about that, it needed to be addressed. I don't know much about the Iraqi Dinar, but I do know about bitcoin. And it seems you are classifying the bitcoin community as trying to force others to into investing in bitcoin, which couldn't be farther from my experience. Even if you think that's the avg type (which I disagree with) it has nothing to do with the underlying asset, nor its creation, or the intent of its creation. 
And further, you can take bitcoin the asset, and create a ponzi scheme with it, which has happened. But that has nothing to do with the open source code (units of the ledger) and the free market demand for them. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 03:19:57

I cant speak for the overall downtrend, but I have heard a few theories about the bearwhale which are pure speculation, one could be this:
Another could be a strategy of a whale (who had a lot of cash from selling throughout the last few months) to put up this huge wall on bitstamp, hoping to hold the market down with no one being able to eat it all up on one exchange. And in the mean time, he accumulates more or equal to 30k bitcoins under $300 on various exchanges across the world, and then he can use millions from the sale on bitstamp once the wall is fully eaten to fuel the next rally. Or heck, maybe he even helped buy part of his own wall after he accumulated enough--it helps confidence to see such a big wall get eaten rather than take it down. Who knows. 
Or, maybe it was just simply an early adopter who had a serious emergency and needed the cash immediately and was forced to cash out at a very low price, but really to me, it seems he could get his order filled in just as much time or less with out spooking the market and putting up smaller orders of say 5k at a time. But it's possible the emergency/inexperience caused him to panic and just try to get it sold.
Finally, maybe he just thinks its a good time to sell and buy back cheaper and is either totally wrong or the smartest trader in the room. 
Just my two satoshis.

Can we sticky this on the front page? It's a common misconception for those new to bitcoin these days. 
And I don't blame them, but what really gets me is when people are giving their supposed expert opinions about bitcoin and miss this point, it's sort of hilarious. A blockchain that is centralized, is basically a f***ing general ledger. They are effectively saying, we are going to re-invent this technology which is beneficial (faster, cheaper, and more secure) because it eliminates third-parties, by introducing a third party...like what? There is a reason they are referred to as peer-to-peer currencies. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:59:15
The way I see it, they are competing for two completely different markets. 
-Bitcoin aims to capture a portion of global remittances market (estimated to be $500 billion) by offering a cheaper, faster, and more secure alternative, how exactly does a domestic centralized company tap into this market and compete with Bitcoin?
-Bitcoin aims to be a store of value like gold or silver for those who have poorly issued currencies that continually lose purchasing power, bitcoin's mathematically ensured scarcity makes it a great contender to do this. Or a good alternitive in a crises if someone or some bank tries to cease your funds.  What does this have to do with Venmo? The precious metals market is valued in the trillions. 
-Bitcoin offers the many features of programmable money such as multi-signature transactions, smart contracts, and choosing your own level of transparancy and auditablility from completely anonymous (if done properly) to completely open on the blockchain. 
-Some other markets bitcoin hopes to tap into are, online gambling, micro-payments, and crowd-funding...sound like a reality for venmo? 
I could add much more, but aside from the lack of thoughtful responses here, it seems pretty obvious to me that these are two completely different animals. Bitcoin has the potential to replace a global trade. I used to think the same way as you about my friends and if they would use it etc...but personally I am a some-what privileged person living in the US, and your situation may or may not be similar, but whether or not bitcoin will succeed does not depend on people like us needing it, it depends on the right people building infastructure so the other 6 billion people that are underbanked in the world can use it for personal empowerment and economic freedom.

The way I see it, even if you are not a creditor of gox, you do not want 200k coins to be sold on the market right now especially considering that the money will likely take up to 10 years to reach customers and they will get an extremely small fraction of that amount. 
So I am not sure if you are implying this but, I don't see how it would be in anyone's interest, creditor or not, to downvote this. Personally, I would rather people get their share of coin back for now, even if they wish to immediately sell it for fiat (which I don't believe will happen as most are long on bitcoin) but at least this way they will get the proceeds and not lawyers who will eat away at the proceeds for years to come.

All valid points.


I think it will be a combination of raising education/awareness coupled with a significant improvement in user-interface for various products which would likely come from all of these new venture backed companies popping up. My prediction is hardware wallets will become much cheaper as well as easier to use. Multi-sig will be the standard with everything. 
And third-party services will be replacing addresses with usernames, I mean this is already sort of happening with ChangeTip, Coinbase, and others. I can tip someone through various platforms without using an address on changetip. I can send bitcoin to an email address using Coinbase. Albeit, this is obviously not being your own bank, but I think its a good intermediary step towards that. First we all used AOL, then we realized how much better the internet was.

It's not like they would force it upon anyone, it would be for interested merchants who wanted to allow people to buy things with their Litecoin. I agree that they should not just start adding tons of alt coins. Yes, this could serve to confuse people and would be a risk to credibility if the alt fails or is 51% attacked, but the network (with Litecoin) is pretty damn secure, and it is highly liquid as compared to any other alt. If other alts ever got to this level then they could consider them as well but it doesn't seem like that is coming any time soon. 
Right now Coinbase is losing business to GoCoin, who also partnered with PayPal. I'm not a huge fan of Paypal, but clearly there was a reason they included GoCoin in the mix as well. The way I see it, it would be a win for Coinbase, interested merchants, and users. Further, there is a high demand to buy litecoin as easily as you can with Coinbase or Circle, the same ease of purchase/use would be highly beneficial to Litecoin users as well. It's not like Litecoin is trying to eat Bitcoin's lunch anyway, it's more of a compliment and can help keep transaction fees low on both networks.

Lol no wonder your attitudes are what they are then. Anyone who has been around for all the ups and downs knows we are not seeing anything out of the ordinary. The fundamentals of the technology have not changed. Honestly, in terms of long term viability/adoption/development I would say we have had 10x more of that from November till now as opposed to from when btc was at $13 until November. 
The short term to medium term price of bitcoin has a mind of its own, the market is highly illiquid and volatile, price discovery is a process that happens over years--so I would chill out. If you let the price from week to week or even month to month dictate your attitudes/feelings--your own life will be highly volatile, your attitude seems to suggest you are in over your head here. If you really believe in bitcoin you would not be phased by what the uninformed think. 
Bitcoin right now (as an investment) is not for the faint of heart, if you are truly in it for the real implications of the technology then you should be more optimistic then ever right now. I almost can not believe how much shit has happened over the last year, it's ridiculously exciting *to me at least.*
@_date: 2014-11-10 15:23:46
Yes, but no where near the magnitude of post central banking. But ya, bitcoin does not solve world peace--humans will be humans.

@_date: 2014-12-17 20:20:43
Haha, it really does. I could care less. I really am excited, call me delusional all you want. Bitcoin is amazing to me, people have trouble stepping outside of the narrow lense of looking at how it has performed as an investment. I first started paying attention to bitcoin in early 2013, it's been a wild ride. 
I couldn't have imagined how fast things have moved. If the price was at $1000 many would agree with me, but to me that's totally the opposite of looking at things objectively. Ill take bitcoins chance of success right now (with the price being at $300) any day over it's chance of success 1 year ago at $1000.
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:48:37
That's an interesting thought...or is that the market cap is right and *the price per coin* is way off.  But I guess if you are deriving the "market cap" by multiplying coins that can potentially be spent by the current market rate--you are correct. Just tough to really know *for sure* how many are burned and how many are just sitting but might eventually be spent like satoshi's stash.
I do wonder though, if every big investor is buying based on the assumption that there are around 13 million in circulation, then we suddenly found out **for a fact** that there was like 50% missing or something--would that decrease or increase the price? I sort of think it would increase it.

Yes I am, a big part of what accounting firms do is provide auditing/attestation services, but yes it is technically true that an auditor is not neccesarily an accountant. So, what I really mean is that financial auditors or external auditors of accounting firms may be disrupted, and this is a big part of what accounting firms offer. They do many other things, do not get me wrong, and as I stated above I believe accountants will always be around just as banks or depository/lending institutions will be, but I personally see them having to adapt to a much lesser more efficient role.

If the transaction fees will be very small, how will this company make a profit for the services they are providing? Will they not have many costs to cover (as any other company does) such as labor and overhead?
How can we know this proposed centralized blockchain will be secure? Is it secure because they will use cryptography, and limited access with regard to who gets to see the ledger as a whole? Because Chase, Citibank, and every other bank already does this so I don't exactly see what benefit this proposal would have, or how it would be different from a traditional bank. Unless of course, anyone could participate by downloading a copy of the ledger and helping secure the network, but that would essentially be a company releasing an alt-coin.
Lastly, how would the currency be distributed? Or would this just simply be pegged to $--another payment mechanism no different than our existing ones.
I think what most people miss is that the blockchain in it of itself, is really not all that different from any other ledger. The speed, security, cheap cost, and openness all stem from its decentralization. So, to think some hot-shot company can some how "harness the blockchain technology" is pretty ridiculous, as its just a fricken ledger. I don't see how this company can improve upon what traditional banks/paypal/venmo do.

I never had coins on gox but they make some good points, it might take up to 10 years to get very little or basically none of your funds back, immediate liquidation would mean 200k plus coins going up for sale on the market (this is twice the amount that the bitcoin investment trust holds) and this money would not even be going to customers, this would go towards all the lawyer fee's and other fee's incurred in order to distribute what ever is left over, typically around 3% remains for customers according to the statistic quoted in the episode.

If bitcoin serves as a good alternative to some of the worst currencies in the world, that alone completely justifies its existence. Not to mention the tons of other benefits the payment system and programmable money in general have to offer. 
But I was commenting on his statement alone, sure our economy is fine in comparison to the others, but that's mostly because of the artificial demand created from the US$'s status as the world's reserve currency. But countries like China, Russia, and others are already looking for ways work around this. 
We also have made it appear as if our economy has been in a recovery when it really is not. First we bailed out all the big banks with TARP creating systemic risk for the whole economy, then we conjured up unthinkable amounts of cheap credit for these banking institutions to loan out at much higher interest rates to others. This hasn't created any new productive capacity or jobs or anything of the sort but rather has created asset bubbles all over the economy including the stock market. 
We have simply rewarded the same people that got us into this mess in the first place with the authority to continue gambling away our money at no risk to themselves. In free markets their should be a risk vs return relationship for enterprises, we are at a point where we have effectively eliminated that with regard to these institutions. It is only a matter of time before this giant debt bubble finally pops, and it when it does, I anticipate this dude will not have much to say.

There is also a responsibility/incentive for miners to leave the pool as well. No the community is not going to pay them but they may just ruin bitcoin and destroy their/and everyone else's monetary value.

Seriously contemplate what you are referring to, ask yourself what a centralized blockchain really is. A blockchain that is maintained by one entity as opposed to the consensus of miners, is simply a good old fasioned general ledger. 
Why wouldn't Chase want to have their own centralized blockchain you ask?! The answer is they already do lol that is how a bank works. Im posting on my phone but you can check my comment history, i wrote about this in another thread recently if you are interested. 
You either have distributed consensus through miners i.e bitcoin, or you have a central entity maintaining a ledger, i.e jpmorgan chase. With a central ledger you have all the costs to maintain it--labor, oh, costs of transferring to other ledgers worldwide through various archaic wire transfer systems, which i have nothing against, or you eliminate these costs through a decentralized network of computers. If we are being practical,
We must take into account the costs of acquiring bitcoin today which range depending on which exchange/method you use, but once you are in bitcoin the costs to move spots in the ledger is close to free.
To sum it up, banks have employees/oh to prevent double spending (sending the same money to two different parties) and bitcoin has the network of miners to prevent this. To suggest there is anything new or innovative about a centrally maintained ledger is a failure to understand the essence of what makes bitcoin work and gives it its benefits of faster, cheaper, and more secure.

That's pretty debatable, I would say it totally depends on the innovation or feature. Sure, things like the supply limit/confirmation time will not change, but other features certainly **can** be incorporated. Also, some features that can not be incorporated, can be implemented in layers above, or *potentially* with side chains or tree chains. 


Maybe, it would be foolish to discount the possibility, but you seem a little too sure of it for my comfort. The network effect can be a really tough thing to overcome.

Personally, I think the regulations should not be ignored and will potentially affect how bitcoin is used within america--to the detriment of anyone living here--but outside of that they're really not *that* important.
So, since we are the ones who fail to miss this crucial point that you always knew-due to our cognitive dissonance--and you do not suffer from such--would you mind offering up a prediction of within what time frame you believe bitcoin will fail? I am just curious. It would be nice to have it on record in case you might be wrong like all the rest who have written obituaries for bitcoin. Or is it just that you think bitcoin will not fail but simply be co-opted and molded by forces within government? Just trying to see where you are coming from.

Why am I delusional to think Ebay/Paypal would let users trade with bitcion if the CEO of Paypal has publicly advocated bitcoin on numerous occasions and basically said they are keeping a close eye on it? They are already working on a wallet that lets users store many digital currencies including bitcoin. 
Also, so what is the benefit to using Amazon coin over the WS coin that you claim is coming out? Or googles coin? Or Facebook's coin? Or JPmorgan's coin? They are not really coins at all they are payment systems disguising themselves as coins. Why will these payment systems be any better then glorified paypal's and what is it about one of them that will seperate themselves from the pack? 
If it is Amazoncoin that wins out over FB coin, will Overstock, Tigerdirect, New egg, and other competitors accept my amazoncoin? Why throw them a bone? If I want remitt some amazon coin to my relatives in other coutnries will there be liquid exchanges for them to convert to local currencies as is being worked on for bitcoin all over the world right now? 
Since these are centralized systems, can I create multi-signature transactions or unique escrow features or any other benefits of programmable money using amazoncoin or any other?

Personally, I am okay with considering/debating the effects of every change on the decentralized nature of bitcoin, I do not doubt that there are changes that need to be made that must sacrafice a bit of this to move forward, but I think such debates are neccessary even if they slow down the process of getting things done.

Right but they (major merchants) are still charged a flat rate? Interesting, if it is not changing based on volume, I could see either the merchant or bitpay getting screwed over if there is a really bad /good month in terms of that merchants volume, or if the rate is estimated poorly. But I guess this gives them a huge competitive advantage over coinbase, assuming that flat rate is not too high of course.

Guess what, if I pay you cucumbers for a product or service, that is income, and technically you are responsible to report the fair market value received as income to the IRS. But OMG what can you do? You only have cucumbers!? You fucking sell 10-20% of your cucumbers and you pay the IRS your taxes. 
I mean is that really so hard to understand? Are you really trying to argue that simply because vendors are still responsible for reporting their income in bitcoin--and converting a small amount into $ (once a year) to pay it--that is enough to deter the spread of this technology? (Which makes your life easier in like 10 gazillion other ways, but I'm sure you know all about that from your extensive research)
Anyway, if you believe that, that's fair, but it has nothing to do with the main thesis of your post that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme--of which you have provided no evidence to support.

Any troubles you are referring to I would imagine are related to closing accounts that involve the SALE of bitcoin from one user to another which introduces unique problems of determining whether or not the buyer receieved the coin and charebacks...my comment has nothing to do with this as I am talking about POTENTIALLY letting buyers use bitcoin to pay for goods. I didn't say anything about being able to use it right now with ebay or paypal so thats not really relevant to me.
And why does it have to be recent? Is this just a stipulation you threw in because you know that I am right but they haven't publicly said anythign in the last few months? I will not waste anymore time on this, here is an article I found with a quick google search  I'm not sure how recent it is--I'm sure its not within the last few months--but I'm also not sure where that came from or wtf it has to do with anything. If you are calling "negative actions" problems with using bitcoin on ebay right now that is nothing new, people were reporting stuff like that ever since people have been trying to use bitcoin on ebay, they do not officially support it yet duh...

Yup starts off with an emulation of wall street with people shouting trades...this sets the tone. Touches on the great use cases of bitcoin such as gambling, buying weapons, narco trafficing etc etc (sarcasm). They have to present a some-what positive side of things so they put a small caption in of Barry Silbert and others. Later, they interview some guy who talks about how the economists told him that bitcoin was a bubble and he believes them but still thinks he can make some money off of it. Hmmm, well if the economists told you something then it must be accurate right? They were totally on top of the real estate bubble and called that one way before it was too late...

Hey Alex, 
Although I am very much against Coin Validation, I would love to hear your side of things...would you mind explaining to us how white listing coins does not make some coins more legitimate then others? Or in other words, do you acknowledge that this would in effect destroy the fungibility of bitcoin? 
Do you care about bitcoin succeeding outside of the United States/realize that it is inevitable? What is your take on how major companies such as Dish Network, Expedia, Overstock, and the rest have no problem accepting bitcoin as it is today? To me it seems like bitcoin is succeeding just fine as is--more and more merchants are jumping on the bandwagon faster than ever etc etc.
Regulation is inevitable sure as bureaucrats need their control but the bitcoin protocol itself (as well as the demand to use it) seem to be chugging a long just fine regardless of that, not to mention we are talking basic AML/KYC laws necessary to convert from $ into bitcoin, why exactly would we ever possibly need anything extra once you are fully in bitcoin? After all bitcoin is digital cash, would you think it made sense to track every dollar bill's path? If so I have a great opening for you at the NSA. 
Would love to hear your thoughts. Take your time, but it would really be a bit revealing if your whole argument is that people misunderstand CV yet you do not feel a need to explain what we are missing.

The supply of coins on the exchanges, is the supply of coins on the exchanges--whether from miners, speculators, or anyone else. I don't see how the fact that 3600 of them may (theoretically) be from miners provides any evidence that trying to buy large amounts of coin would not push the price up in the process. It's not like you can get in touch with these miners directly and buy from them as the coins are spread out all over to various entities and may or may not be for sale. Also, isn't it true that newly created coins have to wait some time period before they can be spent?

I'm pretty sure he is talking about bitcoin in general, not a bitcoin business, not sure why you would assume the latter. 
OP--Coinbase.com and Circle.com are great for buying bitcoin if that is what you are looking to do. Look into how you want to secure them as others have mentioned. Trezor is great if you plan to invest in anything over 1 full bitcoin. Definitely take some time to research it and understand the risks and get comfortable with them before investing though.

So, bitcoin will fail because merchants and miners are dumping? Basically that's your whole argument? You seem very fair about things, and I respect your decision. And it very well may crash to the ground in a burning fire, but I think you are taking something insanely complex and deducing it down into comfortable boxes that work with you. Which is totally cool. I am just not so sure it's that simple. 
Those factors are important, but pretty temporary, but yes they certainly are affecting the **short term** price. But a lot of things affect that, I do not think you are claiming to understand the many variables that affect the day to day price, nor am I. At least I hope you are not, if so good luck, it's like the most unpredictable market there is. Who knows what will happen if an ETF is approved or if Ebay starts accepting bitcoin, or conversely if BTC-E were to get hacked? *But I think your post is more about whether or not bitcoin will succeed in the long term.*
I look at how far bitcoin has come since a year ago and personally I am amazed at the hundreds of startups/hundreds of millions of $ in VC investment, increasing liquidity (atms, # of exchanges worldwide, circle/coinbase in the US),  development (and developers some leaving established tech companies)/ applications popping up, cool experiments like at MIT or Islands trying to make closed btc economies, *insane growth of merchant acceptance (see below) , the tone of the media when covering it, the different applications of blockchain technology, etc etc and I am simply amazed. I can't even keep track of it all anymore.
Are we ready for mainstream acceptance right at this moment? No definitely not--no where near it. We need to get to a point where avg. joe can use and secure their bitcoin extremely easily. I think it will come. 
But personally I tend to focus on the rate of change toward that goal rather than how close we are to the destination. That's just how I see it, things are still very very early. If btc ever becomes ubiquitous--or is approaching that--as an investment it will be way too late. It very well may fail, don't get me wrong, but I'm not so sure you will be as happy as you think if bitcoin is worth a few thousand dollars in a few months lol but if so I really respect that. 
*Even while they are converting to $--the argument of having no place to spend bitcoin is dead, and once these places start paying their employees and suppliers in btc they will not convert everything. Will we get to that point? Maybe, maybe not. But as many of said its sort of a chicken and egg problem, you cant have user adoption with out merchant adoption and vice versa, one had to happen first and I think this way makes more sense. My bet is that user adoption will catch up the next 6-12 months. 
**TL;DR I don't think the future of bitcoin is as simple as your analysis**

I'm pretty sure Ethereum is more for contracts and things like this. Bitcoin is money, and has a huge first mover advantage in this respect. Microsoft, Paypal, Time, etc are accepting bitcoin. Ethereum isn't even a working product yet I'm pretty sure. I think you are underestimating 5 years of network effect. Bitcoin has 10's of thousands of developers working on it etc. The roots are being planted in countries with poor currencies. I think it would take a long time for Ethereum to get anywhere near as liquid as bitcoin. Further, bitcoin is by far the worlds most powerful computer network, its secure as fuck. It's battle tested. It's Anti-fragile.
Ethereum seems like a great concept, but there is tons of competition competing to do what it is doing. I think the main point you are missing, is that Ethereum can work great with bitcoin, if it wins out over a bitherium sidechain, counterparty, mastercoin, bitshares, colored coins, maidsafe, etc etc etc etc. 
Bitcoin has benefited from a virtuous cycle of gaining hashing power, which gained liquidity, which gained users, which gained merchants, which gained developers, and over and over again. Until eventually it has gotten to a point where there is hundreds of millions of Venture Capital that has been invested in companies working to make new products and services for it. Mature financial platforms are coming, we are eagerly awaiting an ETF, this liquidity would further the cycle even more. You are grossly underestimating how hard that is to do. Also there is so much value in the community, which I didn't even touch on. 
By the time this all happens for Ethereum, where will bitcoin be? Things move fast, currency is a language, and many people will be speaking bitcoin by then hopefully, I don't see how this new language will replace bitcoin, especially if it becomes the defacto method of payment for the internet and or international remittances. By the way, I'm pretty sure the only way to get some ether is to exchange bitcoin for it...

Well, that's true with the power of cryptographic solutions, we don't need any of this external regulation, so I guess as long as an exchange (btc bank?) disclosed the fact that they were not keeping 100% of reserves on hand in order to do x, y, and z and we could verify that through the blockchain, I guess I have no problem with that. Personally, I would only want to use exchanges that keep all customer deposits on hand down to the last satoshi, but if others want to use ones that did not and were aware of it that's fine too. 
There has been some debate as to if any form of fractional reserve is even possible or beneficial using bitcoin--as its supply is limited, but that is a separate conversation. I guess when you say BTC backed you mean like the same way gold used to back fiat for traditional banks? But ya, we really don't need any of these regulations we can do them through the blockchain.

I guess you could argue it went "parabolic" then, but really, considering that was already around 1.5x the previous all time high, I would say it had started already before that maybe around $150-$200


Meh, I remember Shopify, Word-press, and Virgin Galactic but I think those were coming when we were already in the midst of the rise...I would argue it had a lot more to do with a little country known as China. 


Oh yea? Has it sucked pretty much every month since? I guess you are referring strictly to the price--and you don't follow anything else about the space. Thus why you call it "shit", yes the price has consistently decreased since the big run-up, as it did after the run-up to $266 in March 2013--cool story hansel. How does this guy get on tv?

Does anyone? They are mystical creatures. Jk, but yes accountants provide many services not limited to but including attestation and taxation. In terms of taxation if the government is still around of course accountants will be needed, but in terms of attestation/assurance services I could easily see a big disruption here. A company would easily be able to track their own in-flows and out-flows as well as balances of assets, liablilities, and equity on a blockchain of some kind, and be able to generate reports for stakeholders to verify with out the need for an external auditor of any kind. Now, who would be preparing these reports and ensuring they are implemented correctly? Internal auditors. So, yes accountants will certainly be around in some capacity as banks will be, but IMO I can see a large bulk of the services they over-charge for could be diminished greatly.

Yes, merchant adoption is vastly outpacing consumer adoption, but one had to go first before the other, I think it's better this way and things will pick up soon enough for user adoption. It's really now--If you're a consumer there is much much more of a reason to use bitcoin now then there was 6 months ago. If you can remember pre-overstock and all the rest, the slogan from the MSM used to be: "Why would I ever use bitcoin, there is no where you can spend them! So what would I do with it?"

Ehh, well I would say that Excel and other accounting softwares such as Quicken make accountants live's much easier, but really the role of low level book keepers is actually being lessened because of excel and different accounting softwares that make it easier to keep the books. Many small business owners run the software themselves to keep track or pay much less than they used to got get a student to do it for them.

Yes which demonstrates the colossal misunderstanding he has of bitcoin. It's not uncommon among those first learning about it. But this dude is going on tv and is so sure of himself. 
It seems simple enough: "Oh well I like the cheaper/faster/more secure payment mechanism, but this volatile currency is not necessary." Except, it simply does not work like that, people need to provide the demand to use these scarce units of the ledger--thus providing them value--in order to be able to transfer value. Or you need a central authority to distribute the units and either help maintain their value through a monetary policy, or peg them to existing currencies, which is not any different than what we already have today.

I just sent them this support ticket: 
I am not sure if you have seen this thread or if the allegations in it are true but if not please check it out: 
As a longstanding, full verified customer, I hope this is not true as I have not received any notice from you that I would need to submit any more documentation. What angers me is not the process of submitting more documents or anything like that (although it is a bit shocking you would need more as i have already submitted plenty and I was totatlly under the impression that it was sufficinet to meet your standards) but the fact that if true, you are demanding this documentation upon a customers intention to withdraw money to their bank account. 
You can not have customers under the impression that they are fully verified and then hold their money hostage when they attempt to withdraw it, to me that is unnacceptable. So, in conclusion, I would like to know if I am truly a fully verified customer? Can you confirm this? If i sell some bitcoin for US$ and try to withdraw it will you request more information from me? As you would imagine, I (and I'm sure the majority of your other customers) would not like to learn about new requirements to get verified when we need our money the most, this is not right. So, I just want to know, if I decide to withdraw US$ or bitcoin of any amount from you will I need to go through any extra compliance measures to do so? Further, please help me complete them now so I don't have to have my money held hostage at a later date when I need it most.

Exactly what I was thinking--so the writer of this article read the regulations and thinks the worst part about them is that bitcoin exchanges will not be able to do fractional reserve banking? Are you kidding? That is like the one part that makes sense. C'mon. Does this guy know anything about bitcoin? I mean we can't know for sure--but fractional reserve banking--may have contributed to enabling the whole Mt. Gox fiasco in the first place.
Point out the fact that you need to register in order to create an alt-coin (which is really just communication protocol that uses math/cryptography). As if they have the right to demand me to get their permission to copy and paste the code of bitcoin with a change or two and post it online. Ridiculous. Point out the fact that third party wallet providers such as Blockchain, Mycelium, or Green Address would potentially have to identify customers and attempt to keep records of incoming/outgoing transactions. Point out that creating tip bots so people can send around a few bits to each other potentially requires registration. 
The whole "bitcoin exchanges are kind of like banks" notion came about simply because it is another party storing your money temporarily, to suggest that we would want (or that these exchanges aim to) operate like traditional banks would be utterly ridiculous and against the whole point of bitcoin. What I want from an exchange is simply to be able to buy some bitcoin, maybe trade a bit, and know that they will have it on hand for when I will inevitably will withdraw it (ideally using cryptographic solvency methods). I don't want any interest in exchange for them leveraging my money out many times over and gambling in a giant casino. Give me an f'n break. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:41:15


Well, think about it like this, if you wanted to get this much coin using exchanges you would certainly push the price up as you were buying, so considering opportunity costs, and assuming some investors believe in bitcoin in the long term or that a year or two from now the price will be higher than it is now, it would make sense to bid at or even above market. 
Given this information, and that all parties have not colluded, all it takes is one party to realize that some of the other parties might realize the same information as well to make it happen. 
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:44:08
Lol, of course I've set up a bank account before despite your presumption, I'm not sure why that is relevant in terms of figuring out better ways to bring bitcoin to the masses with out re-introducing the frictions of the legacy banking system. Of course this is easier than that. These ATM's are a good attempt at bringing bitcoin into the physical world--don't get me wrong, but personally, I would rather not go through the hassle. I'm not sure how I feel about bio-metrics they seem a little bit 1984 to me. I can see why others new to the landscape might potentially want to use these until many of the other "on-ramps" being worked on all over are implemented. But really, this kind of seems like more of a temporary solution to me, just my opinion. If it gets more people into bitcoin until we figure out better ways to go about this than great. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:56:51
I'm sorry if I am getting defensive, I just don't think it's up in the air.


They specifically reference the Open Assets Protocol which only has a working implementation using the bitcoin blockchain.  
Could you rework that and apply it to some other blockchain? Sure. But that's not what happened, if so they would mention it, and it would already be developed before announcing this to the mainstream press. I agree it's weird they did not specifically mention bitcoin, but that doesnt change that they mentioned the Open Assets Protocol. 
They are using colored coins on top of bitcoin for this experiment, if I'm wrong, please let me know when that comes out, I will personally give you $5 in bitcoin.

No. Its an open source technology, how could the units of ledger imply anything? That's out of their capability.


normal people don't understand?
Lol, no it doesnt. Thank you for proving my point again. See point 1.


Again, for the umteenth time, it's open source code, it can't "pressure" anyone. With regard to (few copies left?) maybe you are getting at the fact that the amount of units in the ledger are limited. 


No. See point 1. Open-source code can't "claim" anything. If Microsoft, Paypal, Time inc, etc want to associate **themselves with bitcoin** that is of their own fruition. It's not as if the code is saying "oh hey I'm associated with Microsoft, come invest in me"


No, absolutely not, again see point 1. It can't claim anything.

Speculating but I would assume it's not that easy to buy small amounts, or worth it. Also, while there is some verification with coinbase I would assume it's not as tough as the exchanges (b/c they are a broker). Could be wrong. 
Lastly, coinbase makes things easy for those who are not as tech-savy...you can send btc to an email as opposed to a btc address, etc. In the long term the whole point is to be your own bank and all that but I think it's a great intermediate step sort of like aol was to the internet. But eventually everyone will use the internet when we create better/easier ways to interact with it. I would not be surprised if there is a large demand in Europe (as we have seen in the US) for bitcoin that might be intimidated by a bid/ask spread and might simply want an easy way to get some coin.

Your insanely naive understanding of bitcoin is probably alluding to the fact that there are people who exist that treat it as such and try to get rich quick by investing in it...but oh man, your ignorance or refusal to acknowledge facts is painful. On another note, even if we were to assume you were right, why would you feel the need to warn others who did not have the capability to discern this themselves before investing their hard earned money into it?

I'm not sure about this if someone has just bought and **not** sold, regardless of if they move their coins out or not. I am admittedly ignorant on the topic, is their anyone more knowledgeable in this area? 
My gut feeling is that it would be illegal to force Coinbase to share records of people who only buy bitcoin from them...now if you have traded (bought and sold) then I could see them either forcing coinbase or you yourself (in an audit) to show exactly what you have done with your coins after you moved them out of coinbase, or in other words, prove that you have sent them where you are claiming (and not sold them for an unreported taxable gain on btc-e for example). 
@_date: 2014-07-20 05:17:46


Sorry--you are sort of right, I actually mean user adoption not consumer adoption. User adoption is much much more important in my opinion.
The point of bitcoin is not to make enhanced shopping, but it is nice that we can now use them at these places. I guess you define consumer adoption as people buying bitcoin solely to then use it for shopping. Sure, in a sense I agree with you that there's not much value in buying some bitcoin to then immediately use it at a merchant, but I don't really see consumer adoption as happening like that. 
I see it as people grasping how many things they can do with bitcoin in general that they could not do before, but also being able to spend it at a lot of places and hopefully get some discounts. I don't think people will buy bitcoin individually for each transaction, I see them as buying say a hundred or a few hundred dollars worth on coinbase to dip into when they want to buy something as its just easier than entering all the credit card information. I am not sure how you can not take these developments as an improvement compared to before as user, or even as a prospective user. 
Sure, you can give me the whole why should I use bitcoins if I have dollars which work perfectly fine argument, but I dont see how that equates to "if your a consumer there is really NO reason to use bitcoin." Maybe it does equate to, if your a consumer, and have the choice of buying bitcoin for your next transaction or using your credit card, there is not really much incentive to do so.  
A specific reason would be that merchants will eventually split the cost they save from not using credit cards with the consumer in the form of discounts, which I believe overstock and maybe 1-2 others (tiger direct) have done. Not sure how good the discounts are but they are something. Another would be that you would rather not risk giving out your cc information to another merchant who can potentially get hacked. 
There are also many other reasons to get some bitcoin as you probably know. Maybe you want to try out this cool tipping feature that only crypto can enable you to do. Maybe you want to email your friend money to pay him back. Maybe you want to speculate on its value (which is really much more powerful for other reasons outside of shopping, like remittances or the tons of other things that programmable money offers which i wont get into). Maybe you want to gamble or play poker which is very hard to do with fiat especially in the US. Maybe you want to send money to someone in another country. Maybe you want to watch some porn with out putting in your cc info lol. Idk. 
In terms of ~~consumer adoption~~ user adoption, which is more important but not what you referenced i know, I just don't think it will be only based on people in the US, but further, those who actually do buy it within the US will not solely be buying it to use for their next transaction. Btc is more than just a payment processor, i think consumer adoption will come when people want to just have a little bit of bitcoin to play around with (like $50-$100 worth even) some of which they may use for consumer transactions.

That's fair, and as I said miners should be abandoning as the rate approaches anywhere near 51% so I am not putting it all on them, but yes someone else could do it and that's why I think Peter Todd is right that we have to take this seriously and consider intoducing some changes to the protocol.

Education will be key in helping this process go smoothly. Technology is simply a tool that can be used for good or evil, as long as there are bad people in the world, tools will be used for nefarious purposes, this does not change the fact that tools are useful. And besides, bitcoin or not, the genie is out of the bottle, we can either push crypto-currencies into the dark side of things to solely be used for these purposes, or we can embrace how insanely important bitcoin is for empowering billions of people globally. To me the pros vastly outweigh the cons.

The way I see it, we are all under mass-surveillance whether we like it or not, while the fed, major corporations, and gov'ts operate under a veil of secrecy. The blockchain enables full transparency of all parties involved if they so choose, and with some (those mentioned above) that would actually be  a good thing. 
It also offers the *opportunity* for privacy for the individual user if done correctly. So, I am **cautiously** optimistic for a future where we can turn the tables and shine the light on those with the most power--who pose as if they *like* transparency when they don't--and help reinstill true privacy for the individual. I do though anticipate many bumps along the road, and it will not be easy.

Coinvalidation is like the antithesis of fungibility. It's whole purpose is to say: these coins are approved by us and are more legitimate--as opposed to all coins are equal and have no prior attachments regardless of where they have been. 
Also, dark wallet is awesome, but if only a small percentage of people use it (as well as any other privacy services), this small % of people will be perceived as the ones who "have something to hide" rather than those who give two shits about basic privacy.

Are you a day trader and if so, do you have any experience in it? You should be happy about the volatility and as mentions you would have had plenty of opportunities to get out of those buys on the spikes each time. *That is if you are day trading for short term profits.* I would be totally lieing if I claimed this was easy to time/accomplish, but if trading for profits is your aim you should have full knowledge of what a gamble this is and not kick and scream when it doesn't go your way.
If you really are an evangelist as you claim, and are not investing more than you can afford to lose, you should be very optimistic about all of those buys with a focus of years out. When bitcoin is at 3k+ per coin a year from now those will all be excellent buys.

...in maybe the top 10-20 countries with respect to strong banking systems or currencies--yes. I think ~~the problem here~~ what is missing here is that the avg person speculating in bitcoin is not one of the billions who need it most. If you live in the US, you and OP are totally right, there is really no need for bitcoin (from a consumer perspective) unless you are remitting money to relatives in another country. Maybe in the future there will be.
But, it's important to note, that those speculating in bitcoin, are providing an *extremely* important function of providing liquidity. If bitcoin is only useful for me for things like tipping, crowd-sourcing, donating etc (things avg joe might not care about at the moment) but I am helping provide liquidity for use-cases that affect real people who can benefit from bitcoin (not to mention their use helps appreciate the value of this scarce resource) then it's all cool with me.

Has the mainstream media or public as a whole ever said that to this point? When they are saying that--the bubble(s) will be over. It was more like bitcoin is a ponzi-scheme, then bitcoin is for drug dealers, then bitcoin is a mirage but maybe the concept of the blockchain will stick around...HOPEFULLY we will get to "bitcoin is the future of money" in the some-what near future. 
Also, I agree--security is absolutely no where near it needs to be, but part of that is opportunity for VC's and entrepreneurs and I don't know if they can solve it in one step, i think it will be a more of a natural progression while more people start using it--more and more convenient easier to use solutions will be coming out.

We still have a long way to go, but still I'm amazed.

Well said, he just seems like a great guy and is involved with bitcoin for the right reasons. He does so much good for bitcoin and I think sometimes it can be overshadowed by those nitpicking at his technical know-how. 
I mean to be fair, he did accept a position as Chief Security Officer, so he should at least have some base-line knowledge at an absolute minimum. But I also think the term bitcoin "security expert" was largely attributed to him from others realizing his great ability to explain **basic** bitcoin security practices etc, that may not mean he should be in charge of security for a company, I really don't know enough about the competency needed and whether he meets that. But to me, its not important.

@_date: 2014-07-16 20:31:48
Well, that's one way to think about it, and it's valid, but there are other factors to consider. Hopefully as time goes on, Bitcoin awareness/education/importance will spread to these countries, and some of the wealthier people in these countries (or others who are not solely interested in remittance) will want bitcoin for their own purposes of A. Avoiding Capital Controls, B. As a hedge against their own country's currency/as a store of value, and c. EVENTUALLY to use at local merchants. These other factors will hopefully even things out a bit. I don't know which of those will take hold in what order in which places, I am sure it will be different all over but sort of a natural process where 1 may take hold an re-enforce the others.
So, yes I agree--this early on--it's still sort of chicken and egg problem, but the whole concept of bitcoin has needed to overcome this concept and seems to be in the process of doing so naturally. For example: why would any people use bitcoin with out any merchants accepting it? Why would any merchants accept it unless there are any users? Yet, we are chugging along gradually gaining both, although over the past 6 months merchant adoption has been vastly outpacing consumer adoption, but I think we are all confident it will even out eventually. I am not sure there is anything we need to do as individuals other than get some popcorn and watch it all unfold over the next 5-10 years. I like the [Bitcoins in Botswana]( lady--she is awesome--i am sure gradually there will be more people/groups like her that will help get this process going in various places. So, is this a big ~~problem~~ hurdle to overcome? Yes, but in my opinion it is only temporary and like with every other problem in bitcoin it can also be viewed as an opportunity.
*Another thing that comes to mind: If such an imbalance exists where there is more sellers due to wanting to convert to local currencies--maybe that could be an opportunity to open up an exchange with multiple fiat currencies where people would be able to arbitrage this imbalance, creating a more efficient market--not sure how feasible this would be. Might be easier in some places than others.

Well, the simplest way I could put it is that when you download a bitcoin node and connect to the p2p network you are in a sense agreeing to follow "all the rules". Not every one who connects are actually attempting to "mine", but regardless, if you are connecting you must follow the rules. 
There are many rules, one of them being that when you succeed in solving a block, you must designate 25 bitcoin to an address of your own as a reward (this is called a "coinbase transaction"), 25 is what it is now, it used to be 50, but after a certain block number (which was known to everyone) miners knew to switch that number to 25, or else it would not be accepted by the rest of the network. 
The same thing will happen again at the next halving, what the actual number is of that block...I forget...but it is known to everyone...and if you succeed in solving that block, and send 25 bitcoin instead of 12.5...it will be rejected by the network.
Sort of make sense?
**TL;DR You can not connect and participate with the bitcoin network unless you are following the rules which are known to everyone as bitcoin is open-source, one of those rules is correctly following the supply function when solving or "mining" a block.**

I am calling it FUD because most of these exchanges stopping services, or shutting down all together, are doing so because of the general unclear atmosphere in China rather than any direct or clear regulatory guidance from the PBOC or any other institutions. If you claim you know that bitcoin is acually "banned" or just effectively "banned" or it will be totally legal and has a bright future you are simply lieing. What we do know is that the three most prominant exchanges have had clever work arounds through out this constant push and pull and are gearing up to become global exchanges even if we assume the worst. Want to give May 10 significance? Go for it, maybe it will end up being the "real" deadline, or maybe its fate will be the same as the previous two deadlines or the one that will follow this one. I would argue that you are contributing more to the FUD than I by giving these deadlines or exchange closures relevance. 
And yes I am lmao too at your statement that WS can simply just make their own coin! Ya and so can every big bank, Facebook, Amazon, and Google, the trouble is creating the platform that EVERYONE will use not just your own customers and creating enough incentives for enough people to mine so your coin is actually transactionally secure. Further, why would it help to introduce a centralized party into a coin, the benefits of bitcoin (free-ish transaction fees, faster transaction settlement times, programmable money, the ability to be as open or private as you want, etc) all stem from its decentralized open nature. 
I am not someone who thinks bitcoin is magical and can never die, and sure something better can come along before WS gets involved, or a major security flaw could be found, etc a lot of things can happen. Or maybe Ebay/Paypal will start letting their users trade with bitcoin. Who knows? What we do know is bitcoin was here long before China was ever involved and it's future is no where near as dependent on this constantly evolving short-term legal status in China as many would like to believe.

I attended an event held by Market Watch with him, Barry Silbert, and one other speaker, and he did admit or claim that he actually owns some bitcoin, it wasn't clear whether he had just purchased it or has had it all along or is simply saying it to hedge his anti-bitcoin public statements. This was in April I believe, it was after the mt gox debacle because I remember them talking about it and him referencing how the price went as low as $135 (completely missing the fact that it was only on mt gox), anyway I will try to find the video and provide you with it but I heard it live in person. 
His whole shpiel is that he claims he has never been against bitcoin but a lot of his students have lost money from it, and he believes that there are not enough people that talk about the RISKS of bitcoin, which I sort of agree with--but how he came up with that prediction I have absolutely no idea--not to mention the manner in which he was so eager to give it opening the NY State senate hearings.

Best investment of the last five years also...but yes the price took an absolute beating this year. In terms of an investment it should be looked at with a long term perspective, and an understanding that it can fail at any time, but if it succeeds these prices are a drop in the bucket. 
IMO bitcoins will either be worth thousands of dollars or they will fail. I could be wrong. At the moment it's demand comes mainly from speculative investment, if we ever reach a tipping point where average people start using bitcoin and we have some real practical use cases--there is only so much bitcoin out there--so the price would have to rise. 
Definitely do some research and feel comfortable with it before investing any significant amount of money. The truth is no one knows what the price will do next, but this type of decline is not out of character for bitcoin, I believe it once reached a peak of $30 and crashed all the way down to $2, it was probably one of the worst investments that year as well. But man oh man what I wouldn't do for some $30 bitcoin lol.

That may very well be true in the event of a catastrophe, but I am really saying more like--people use 3-4 major credit card companies--so to me--it is not crazy that more than one crypto networks can succeed, not to mention that litecoin blocks are solved much quicker so if you are looking for "lighter" quicker transactions maybe that's a reason to use litecoin. What would be cool is if tree chains or side chains succeeds and then it could be forked into one of those.

He needed an excuse as to why he lost hundreds of millions of dollars, and that was his scape goat. 
From a security perspective, that's great the industry as a whole is more prepared for that kind of an attack, from a publicity perspective it was not great at the time and totally fabricated (he was indicating this was why all the money was lost, which in reality was insignificant as recent reports have shown).

In comparison to Vagina coin or any other alt-coin out there? 
And what fraction would that be of the BTC buy-side on BTC-E out of curiosity?  Btc is king and is obviously much more liquid, but I am curious how much more. 
Sorry, you are right, "very liquid" is not a good description, but I mean within the context of the crypto-world. Even with btc, any large amounts will incur some slippage. It's pretty laughable though to try to say ltc is in the same ball park as any other alt-coin in terms of network security or liquidity, it is probably orders of magnitude greater in both. 
Anyway, I am not trying to equate bitcoin to litecoin in terms of progress, or anything of that nature, simply that it's not crazy for it to be in the conversation. Unless you want to make the same mistake that incumbents/big banks do about bitcoin. It has surpassed the hardest part of boot-strapping its network, and the only reason I think it was able to do so is because it represents a compliment to bitcoin. Maybe you think it's unnecessary which is fair, I don't, time will tell.

It seems that the plan is to use forensic accounting to determine exactly what happened to all of the coins and when, and then immidiately distribute the remaining coins based on a pro-rata basis to all creditors. They claim that this is their first order of business before any attempts to get the exchange up and running. 
They seem to be focused on the fact that the courts will determine these funds to be company assets rather than customer assets, and they would like to help get these funds back to the customers where they belong and then go from there.

Good to hear.
Unrelated but what ever happened to those other 600,000 coins? Here we are more than 6 months later, and there are still no updates with the investigation? Were they slowly siphoned out over the years due to poor security or what? If that was true, shouldn't Mark K. be in jail for running a ponzi scheme ever since? Instead of tweeting about his new businesses and such? I could see them withholding some info until the investigation is complete, but I see these tweets from Mark K and conclude that he must be somehow off the hook for all the *potential* fraud. It just doesn't add up to me, unless I'm missing something.

I think you might have initially misunderstood me, or I admittedly did not make myself clear enough. What I was pointing out that's obvious is that was essentially saying: no you are wrong, you can separate the blockchain from **Bitcoin**, look at all the other alt coins, they have succesfully done this i.e. litecoin , etc. So, I meant, yes of course, OP is actually commenting to the greater argument that you can't separate a crypto-currency from it's unit of account. That is what was obvious to me--obviously there are many alt coins with their own blockchains out there. 
So, I wasn't saying that "you can't separate a crypo-currency from it's unit of account" argument is obvious. But I do agree with you.

It puts a stamp of approval on the security of the network, many think bitcoin (or the blockchain itself i should say) can easily be hacked, obviously we know differently, but the fact that NASDAQ is willing to trust it is kind of a big deal. 
They also must be some what confident in bitcoin the unit of account as well--if it were to collapse in value the network would not be secure.

Agreed, my ah-ha moment was more use-case oriented but I think there was also shred of understanding the implications of a borderless currency. Transcending capital controls, potentially allowing billions of people to access liquidity and trade with the rest of the world, etc. 
Essentially, I agree the why bitcoin question can be answered in a very practical way that need not go into any political ideology, which is why I believe in it as a tool that people of all walks of life will simply find useful. 
But still, with out assuming bitcoin will replace all fiat currencies and allow us to reach some utopia, I think there is still a lot of real fascinating implications about how we can all interact with each other in ways that we previously couldn't, both in simple practical ways as well as more politically motivated ways. 
I wouldn't start off a conversation about bitcoin with someone by talking about it as a potential way for populations to escape collapsing currencies, but for all I know it can become a tool for that. Or for providing lending to very productive aspects of the globe that are very capable but simply don't have permission to participate. Remittances. Etc. But ya.

Ohhh so now that interest in the currency has been waning and the price has been dropping, NOW people are exploring these other uses. Oh okay, is that how history has went?

Don't see how that applies to my comment...are you implying that even if the market value of a bitcoin drops significantly--the network will still be secure enough for colored coin transactions representing large $ amounts simply because people will be generous enough to spend thousands of $ to mine for complete losses? 
That's just simply not true, sure some people will set up a node and eat the cost out of altruism but that's something totally different, mining would most certainly lose it's competitive nature if there was no economic incentive...
So it just doesn't work like that, sure I can color a coin and make it represent a huge $ value but that recipe will never succeed on a big scale if you can't trust the security of the network reliably.

If the price is $1 thus around 13 million $ market cap...and I'm a wealthy person looking to transact in bitcoin for an international business deal....let's say for 50 million $...my deal would simultaneously increase the market cap more than 3 fold then decrease it 3 fold...this complicates things...thus why bitcoin will necessarily be orders of magnitude more liquid (higher market cap) *if* it is to succeed.

Edit: Also, to the guy who made the video, you can research more and learn from people smarter than I but, the way you can trust that digital scarcity or the 21 million limit will remain is that bitcoin operates on distributed consensus. 
The rules are maintained by the majority of nodes who run the open-source software or bitcoin client. The supply function which is designed to cut in half on average every four years (it's really based on the number of blocks--see difficulty, proof of work, etc) is just one of the many rules. I'm sure others can give better explanations cause this one is pretty shitty.

They are just interesting to observe, it's tough to reliably use them to your advantage though like any other single concept in trading.

Ya, gov'ts are so organized, efficient, and on the same page as each other--I am sure they will all successfully orchestrate a coordinated response that kills bitcoin every where around the world. Because so far all of their individual reactions are totally the same from North Korea to the United States.
/sarcasm. 


What gives bitcoin it's value is us. Bitcoins are not inherently valubale in it of themselves, it is the network of users (and the protocol--which most effectively helps us communicate) that we give value. If we wanted, we could all designate that certain computer files have value, but really what would be the point? Blockchains are much better for trusting each other and preventing the copying of digital assets--but contrary to what you might believe--not all blockchains necessarily have value, and these regulations are not just about bitcoin they are about blockchains/crypto-currencies in general. 
What about a blockchain invented for preventing spam? Or for provable voting? These regulations cover all different types of blockchains unfortunately, of both financial and non-financial value. Read this post for a better understanding: 


Okay, and what is your point? That its easier to conceal money laundering through a computer file? Maybe that's true I don't know for sure especially considering transactions are published on a global ledger. But more importantly, it's also easier for terrorists to coordinate and do commerce using the internet in general, not to mention child pornography and all that--that doesn't mean the benefits do not outweigh the risks. 
This is the regulators problem to solve, and they are doing a terrible job at it right now. Eventually they will find a better balance that does not stifle innovation. For now, this will not kill bitcoin though. If it were actually the regulators who **ultimately** enabled innovation (were the end all be all) the world would be a much different place right now, but fortunately there are other factors at play. Many innovations had to overcome this process. Bitcoin will overcome in the long run. Regulators will feel pressure from politicians once they realize just how many jobs they are losing, and how ineffective some of their rules will be to enforce.

No I don't believe so because there is a set block known in advance when the last mining subsidy reward will be given, I'm pretty sure that is the subsequent block after the reward is 1 satoshi. Whether or not people decide to use smaller denominations should not have anything to do with this date that is already set in time.  
Even if we started using half-satoshis or something, the only rewards would be transaction fees after this set date in time.

A problem? Sure. A known one for years as well as many others, the cause for the loss of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins as we were led to believe? Nope.

All the implications of programmable money--micro-payments, crowdfunding, P2P lending, Multi-sig transactions, and  (meta-layers, colored coins, new prococols or bitcoin 2.0's). 
All the more general implications of blockchain technology and things I can not even imagine that become possible with a distributed consensus mechanism...Decentralized Autonomous Corporations...Namecoin and other niche use-cases...free trade like Dark Market.

Nope, because he is pointing out something obvious which is irrelevant. NASDAQ is in fact using bitcoin itself, and the overall point is that you can not create a crypto-currency without its own unit of account to incentivize mining. 
Yet NASDAQ claims they are using the bitcoin "technology" and all the MSM articles think they mean not bitcoin itself, which is absolutely false, we are all using both the bitcoin technology and "bitcoin" itself as they are inseparable, just like any other crypto-currency and it's own unit of account. It's not as if NASDAQ is using some other alt coin, then his point would be at least some-what related.

The market is pretty damn immature and illiquid, it is of course 1 reflection though. Certainly not the end all be all. 
Unless you think bitcoin reached its peak on all fronts at the end of 2013 (at $1200), and has steadily declined in development, venture capital, start-ups, hash-rate, merchants, applications, and users since. To me its quite the opposite. Which might suggest speculation fuels the rest, and they all reinforce each other, *eventually* creating large bubbles in price, followed by large retracements, as opposed to some 1 for 1 gradual, natural progression.

If that were the case, they would be hitting the major exchanges and thus potentially being linked to who ever took them (I assume you mean the 650k missing coins), which is why I doubt that's the case. 
Some think the fact that the recent police report which suggests fraud was involved (which lends credence to the fact that part of the last bubble was influenced by an attempt by insiders to cover up for past losses/hacks by buying up coins with potentially non existent US$ i.e. willy and marcus bots) may be contributing.
To me bitcoin is just being bitcoin, and we all like to attach narratives after. Eventually this downtrend will end. Good news or bad news hasn't really had a lasting effect on the markets in a long time. It used to be (a year or two ago) that an article could move the market, or someone sneezing, so to me it's a good thing. As long as the development, infrastructure, VC, hash-rate, merchants, etc keeps chugging along eventually user adoption will happen.

When I look at what's happened to the ltc ratio, to me it makes perfect sense.
With some doubting if bitcoin will ever rise again and if the party is over(not me)...who would want their money stuck in some derivative of btc. If it were to drop to say below $200 or even $100, many people would want what ever US$ they can get and fast. As long as such a drop remains in the picture, the ratio will not rise and probably will keep falling. 
Sort of represents people preparing for the worst. While some of us may see those type of drops as an opportunity to take advantage of peoples panic, others would see it as the nail in the coffin for crypto.
This doesn't really have much to do with the 2.0's or anything fundamental with ltc. Could be wrong. Ltc's place in the market is due to the cost to 51% attack it, something no other alt can compete with, they can only create features that can be cherry picked if there is a demand.

Yes, people did get overly excited about that, but the rest of your post pretty much has zero substance to me. I actually think I saw a stat that some of the oldest addresses are accumulating more coins as time goes on as opposed to vice versa. Some of them might be exchanges. Regardless, I doubt any of the early adopters who saw the price crash from $30 to $2 are shaking in their space boots right now. 
But even if they were, whats to say they haven't sold from $1200 all the way down till now? Why is the next potential crash any more "the early adopters cashing out" than this one? Bitcoin is not a hot potato, musical chairs, ponzi-scheme. I don't know what the price will do next, but for every seller there's a buyer, the price will find an equilibrium somewhere.

I'm not an expert either but I think they simply *could* short bitcoin (borrow bitcoin on margin and sell it, eventually covering lower) to make profits and drain US$ out. This does not require ever buying bitcoin in the first place.
But I would also assume, yes, at a certain point you risk things changing up on you when there is more money to be made by buying and pushing the price up, and thus "squeezing" the shorts, who would rush to cover. 
Just alluding to what I believe the article is talking about, but that doesn't mean there couldn't also be big funds who would like to be exposed to bitcoin long term who would be both acquiring as well as trading to improve their position. I suppose it depends which traders we are talking about, what % of volume they account for, and what their intentions are.

I thought we knew they had a separate cold storage wallet of 140,000 coins or so? Not to say we know for sure they have control over it, but that would be about a 12% loss at most. Less if they had other wallets we don't know about. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:17:40


now touching themselves in anticipation. And no I doubt a *major* failure is coming as they likely have less than 2-3% of their coins in their hot wallet.

Of course, I am not disputing that they must report certain types of transactions or anything that is specifically requested...I'm just not sure the IRS is saying provide us with your entire database of every transaction that any of your customers have conducted. This would include someone who simply uses coinbase to buy btc and sends it to his personal wallet, which I would think has nothing to do with the IRS as there is no tax effect in such a transaction. 
In other words, it would be like the IRS telling Citibank to provide every customer's transaction history...as opposed to special cases where someone is being audited, or certain thresholds like sending over 10k in a wire transfer or withdrawing that much.

You are being cute with semantics, yes. You will need a lot of hash power for it to be secure. Litecoin has succeeded in that regard. 
Moving the goal posts? Really? People are upvoting this shit? Ya obviously there are thousands of alt coins out there that have their own blockchains, was this *ever* debated? The real debate is whether or not there is any benefit to a **centrally managed blockchain.** 
Not whether or not Litecoin can work, it obviously fucking works. Anyone can replicate bitcoin, change a few parameters, and it will be the same shit, the tough part is gaining enough mining power for a secure network that costs a lot to attack.  My goal posts were never about bitcoin being the only crypto currency that can succeed.

Well, I think this could happen to some extent, but at the end of the day, bitcoin has the advantage of being a public ledger as opposed to gold. I am not an expert on the matter, but I would think the excess of paper contracts for gold being greater than the actual amount would likely have to do with the fact that many large banks, countries, etc, can claim to have x amount of gold in the vaults, and there is really no way to know if that's true, or if the gold they posses is real and not counterfeit. 
Where as with bitcoin, an etf, country, bank, etc would be able to say, we have this many contracts (or shares of an etf) that are backed by x amount of bitcoin, here is the proof in the blockchain. This would of course be dependent upon us demanding such proof and creating this type of standard.

@_date: 2015-01-04 17:57:13
I feel you. I really do, even if you didn't risk more than you can afford to lose, it can be tough to watch. Just try to keep things in check, and realize bitcoin is the fckn wild west, this is par for the course. 
Does that mean this is just one small bump in the road up to 10k bitcoins in 2015? No, absolutely not. No one knows wtf is gonna happen next, but if you have been following bitcoin for a while these type of insane fluctuations are nothing new. The market is immature and can move fast. Panic, fear, and greed are magnified, and usually are a bigger factor than any sort of ties to the natural progression of infrastructure, development, etc. Those things pay off in the long term. 
As long as the miners keep mining and everything keeps chugging along (price aside) bitcoin is still looking good, it's not time for some of the obituaries you will see out there. 
Try to manage your expectations a bit and things are a bit easier to handle. If it all goes to shit, to me the promise of bitcoin was worth my time and energy. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 16:05:22
That's fair, I don't claim to know exactly what happened over the years at mt gox, but I think it has become clear that hundreds of thousands of bitcoins were not lost because of Transaction Malleability. 
So, if what you are saying is true, what would I do in that situation? I have no idea, but not that. He threw the protocol under the bus when the reality of the situation is this insanely huge loss had nothing to do with it.
And i'm not actually critiquing his idea, just pointing at the irony of the situation. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 02:06:30
Interesting, I actually agree with this point totally, but I think litecoin has already climbed the first parts of this fence. 
Before you can even start to accomplish anything bitcoin has in the last year or two, you need a really secure network that costs a lot of money to 51% attack, you need some liquidity spread out over a bunch of big exchanges to help fuel speculation, and you need a merchant processor (gocoin who partnered with paypal). 
Then you hope that the there's enough speculation (increase in price) to attract venture capital, developers, merchants, and finally users (bitcoin is yet to do this).
Litecoin has a fuck of a lot more hurdles to jump, to get anywhere near bitcoin, but I think those were pretty tough to start. Maybe litecoin will never get there, but it sure as shit has a much better chance than xyz coin. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:12:57
I totally agree, it can only last for so long, any coins borrowed must eventually be bought back, and shorts would dry up eventually. I guess you are pointing out that eventually this process would be self-correcting and the article suggests this could somehow destroy the market. 
With regard to it not self-correcting, I don't know for sure, but I think he is speculating that if the process did not "self-correct" in time, it could be devastating towards miners who would go bankrupt at such low prices and turn their machines off. Possibly creating more panic as the hash rate dropped potentially influencing speculators to value bitcoin lower. Again, not saying *I* think this could or would happen, but I think that is what he is suggesting.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:39:56
You are. 
Edit: I know we have to be skeptical and demand more out of these exchanges, especially with the capabilities of bitcoin, but i'm sorry--bitstamp did not lose 650k coins or come close to anything of that nature. 97% are likely in CS. I will also be shocked if they don't reimburse anyone who may have suffered a loss from this.  Bitstamp has it's problems, but they are simply not Mt Gox or anything similar to it. That doesn't mean we should trust them, nor have to, but lets keep things in perspective.
Edit 2: okay lets go through this comment:


Who is complaining about withdrawels not working? I thought the problem was deposits.


My support tickets to them in the past have always been answered in a timely fashion, I also don't see people complaining about that? Further they just sent out an email to everyone. Further, they are likely working to fix the problem which affects everyone, as opposed to answering individual support tickets. 


Okay, fine, its vague. I'll give you that. For all we know they are still figuring it out and don't want to prematurely give false information. So they put out whats important for everyone to know: dont fricken deposit coins there.
Again, not a huge supporter of Bitstamp, but give me a break they are not Mt Gox last year teetering on collapse.

Because morons.


Possible? This is debatable, with the whole blockchain not bitcoin narrative , I think the real lens through which you should look at it is: what benefit a centrally managed blockchain would really provide over what we already have? Bitcoin's benefits stem from it's decentralized nature. Maybe there are some niche use cases that could benefit from some type of centrally managed blockchain over a regular ledger or database. It's yet to be seen, the burden of proof is on those who think this is both possible and beneficial. 
**But all of the above does not matter in this instance.** All of the last year or so this whole "blockchain not bitcoin narrative" has been the hot meme of the MSM, yet here we actually have NASDAQ deciding to use bitcoin's blockchain rather than creating their own...does this not further validate that bitcoin itself is the answer?  Yet it's being used to promote the above narrative, I think it all stems from NASDAQ's press release and the fact that it does not mention bitcoin itself, even though, it is in fact using bitcoin through colored coins. Still, you would think they would do a bit more research other than simply reading the press release.

I'm sorry but no. Yes it's down that much against bitcoin because bitcoin is king (likely always will be) and nothing comes close to it in terms of how much it has developed, venture capital, etc, out of a class of insanely risky assets--bitcoin is orders of magnitude less risky. 
But in terms of litecoin's fall from  being inevitable and this drop some how validating your opinion, really? It was around this low right before the last time it went to .05 (not to say that will ever happen again). 
Further, the only reason it has ever temporarily fallen out of 2nd is from hot scams such as paycoin, or aurora coin, or xyz coin, and centralized premined ripple which shouldn't even be listed on coinmarket cap.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:05:35


Not necessarily true at all, but again I won't fight you that all parties subsequently defending against this is a good thing, even though it had nothing to do with Mt Gox loss of hundreds of millions of $ worth of btc...
An exchange with the simplest of internal controls would realize something was up when their hot wallets were being withdrawn from at much greater rates than normal. 
@_date: 2015-01-28 17:24:43
The exchange is awesome, and i'm sure it will be regulated/licensed to the fullest extent possible, when it *becomes* possible. 
But I'm not sure why they used something as ambiguous as this as a selling point. On the other hand not sure how regulators can complain when it's on them to provide the steps necessary to get regulated/licensed, but I guess they are taking issue with the fact that coinbase is *claiming* to be fully regulated, not the fact that they are not.

I see this a threat to the same global remittances market bitcoin is fighting for, but I also think bitcoin is much more than that. A lot of its value comes from digital scarcity something which likely would not apply to facebook's currency or payment system or w.e you want to call it.

While I agree the comparison is in ways similar to that, you have these 5 guys and others debating these huge decisions and how to move forward, but I think the main difference is that even after all the debate and eventually some sort of consensus amongst this group, they must successfully convince the majority of the network to upgrade their software.
So ya, I see your point and all but I'm not so sure its so comparable to how the fed can make hundred billion $ loans to other countries with all of us avg citizens having absolutely no idea what they are doing. Not to mention how they are not audited (the fed) and all and all of these discussions are happening literally in front of everyone, and everyone is free to participate in the discussion, and ultimately upgrade the software if they run a full node, which is actually kind of cool.

In terms of value, not quite sure how you could make a case it's bad.

It will open people's eyes up from the same old narrative of bitcoin the currency which is used for bad things by bad people, they will begin to see more how it's really just a very useful tool that can be molded in a lot of different ways.

I actually happen to be a big fan of litecoin partly for that very reason...but you seem to be missing my point. I'm just emphasizing that when people try to make the "blockchain won't work without bitcoin" argument they are referring to the fact that decentralized crypto-currencies need their own unit of account to maintain the benefits they have. They are not saying bitcoin is the *only* blockchain that can succeed, whether they feel that is true or not, I don't.
Or in other words, it's not about bitcoin vs litecoin, the argument is talking about bitcoin vs ripple/steller/eris/fed coin or any of these concepts.

Not positive but I believe it is a reference to the fact that a transaction which happens on the blockchain will essentially provide a third entry that can corroborate the other two, and prove that party A did transact (and settle) with party B.
If party A buys a good from B, in double entry accounting they will be given an asset such as cash, and record revenue for it. Yet we can't really prove that B received the money from A, but if you can reference the transaction on the blockchain, then it's indisputable that A transacted with B.
You could not do this with cash, and if a cc was used this transaction could be reversed at a later date, where as on the blockchain settlement is irrevocable.
...how you would prove that party A is tied to a public address in a pseudonymous system...that i'm not sure, but I think as someone else said this would be more for legal contracts and such in which you wouldn't really have anonymous parties in the contract.

That's a ridiculous statement and I don't blame you in the slightest because you admittedly don't know much about bitcoin. And this is not me telling you to invest in it, or rather to hold on to what you have, but just want to give you an informed answer.
If you can afford the risk, and with your case maybe you can because this was money you didn't even realize you had in bitcoin, then there is still potential for 100x+ returns. The scenario is sort of binary in that it can easily fail as a concept and go to zero or close to that, but if it succeeds and we see some real use-cases determining demand as opposed to pure speculation, these prices would necessarily have to rise orders of magnitude. 
That might sound crazy to you, but its really sheer supply and demand, that said, if it all goes to shit you can totally lose your investment. Do some research, see how you feel about it's potential and go from there maybe. 
But I wouldn't solely assume the price will not rise simply because there was a bubble and huge retracement, many did the same when the price rose to $30 and crashed to $2....

@_date: 2015-04-30 19:05:42


What if I want to send my friend who uses Coinbase $10, i would have to send him the bitcoin, and coinbase would have to convert it to $ which would incur a small fee no? 
Don't see how it could work otherwise, they don't have a partnership with Coinbase as far as I understand, and coinbase is receiving btc not $, then is converting. For them to receive $ would necessitate some sort of bank transfer, as opposed to sending within the circle network, which is them just updating their internal ledger. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 19:40:25


Sure, they can also just put the same individuals who would be responsible for "mining" in charge of just manually updating a good old-fashioned general ledger. If in your example, there are only a few IBM rep's secretly running this new hash algo, they can also easily collude and make the ledger what ever they want it to be. I mean that likely wouldn't happen, as they'd be trusted to do their job, and you could have some internal controls to prevent wrong-doing, but it wouldn't be prevented because there is a blockchain as opposed to a ledger. 
So, my question is what advantage does that have over just designating a few trusted individuals to update balances in a regular ledger or database? 
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:15:39
I won't pretend to be nuanced in the tech. For me it comes down to the fact that it's not its own currency in it of itself, thus it's just another payment system like paypal. 
There's nothing wrong with that, it may be beneficial, I just don't think it should be compared to bitcoin or any other decentralized currency. The difference is in the reversibility of payments and incentives system. As long as you wait for a sufficient number of confirmations then you're payment can not be reversed, with stellar I'm sure there is a way to coerce someone into reversing a payment. 


Again I don't know how it works exactly but if you are saying it in a sense that it's as secure as paypal or something of that nature, then fine, you win. But as long as it's pegged to another currency, the payment can be reversed one way or another. This is not so with bitcoin, wait a few confirmations and that settlement is final, regardless of if someone can temporarily gain control of the network.

@_date: 2015-04-03 13:20:02


Meaning to make payments reversible? Okay. What's new about that? Or in other words, how do you define distributed but not open? 
If I have something like an appropriation budget or something of that nature, of which anyone can propose an expenditure, but say the CFO and internal auditor must sign off on...couldn't you call that a "distributed" ledger? Yet this has already existed for a long time, it's a just a regular database or ledger, that requires some internal controls to prevent fraud. 
Or I guess more relevant would be a cc company's database, which would require their own process of internal controls (w.e that would be, waiting a time period for the buyer to reverse the payment, sending him updated balances, giving only authorized parties access to make changes when appropriate, etc)
What advantage does the locking together of blocks using hashes provide if the designated authorized parties can collude (or even just be given permission) to make the ledger what they want it to be? 
My point is not that these characteristics are of no value to anyone i.e. reversible payments, but rather that I don't see how they are improved by some type of centrally managed blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 19:19:56
Great question, I'm not so sure they gain anything *by using bitcoin* in this specific regard. But the bitcoin community certainly gains from it. And maybe they'll gain users for providing this service. 
Maybe a better question is why wouldn't they have provided this from the start, or why hasn't Coinbase done the same? Maybe they will soon. It puts them on an equal playing field with Venmo, but unless im missing something, not as a result of bitcoin. 
They actually have more risk taking on the liability of fixing the value of bitcoin for these users, maybe they can make money off of that if they are good at managing the risk i'm not sure. Seems like Coinapults locks basically.

Pools have tried to double spend a bunch of times, people always catch it. If someone double spent your transaction you would notice and point it out. Miners would leave the pool.


Tbh I don't know much about stellar but I highly doubt that. The difference is that anyone can mine bitcoin, if it becomes too centralized, it will naturally adjust. If hashing power becomes too concentrated in pools, and you can take down some pools, the difficulty lowers and there's more incentive for others to mine.

Yes, in the same sense as Venmo as in you can withdraw that $ to your bank account or send it to someone else (who is signed up with Venmo).

Abolishing currency will constitute a noticeable change in many people’s lives and change often tends to be resisted.
**Currency use remains high among the poor and some older people.** (Buiter suggests that keeping low-denomination cash in circulation — nothing larger than $5 — might solve this.)
Central banks and governments would lose seigniorage revenue.
**Abolishing currency would inevitably be associated with a loss of privacy and create risks of excessive intrusion by the government.**
Switching exclusively to electronic payments may create new security and operational risks.
Buiter dismisses each of these concerns in turn, finishing with:
**In summary, we therefore conclude that the arguments against abolishing currency seem rather weak.**

That's like saying, if learning how to play poker to win money worked, then everyone would do it, and it would stop working. Not to say it's not true, because you are right to an extent. But if everyone was doing it, there would still be some that are better than others who would benefit in the long term. 
So, ya, you are right. But that doesn't mean it doesn't work, it just means it's a zero sum game. I'll take the best poker player at the table any day over one chosen at random, same with an experienced trader vs someone flipping a coin. On an individual trade or hand, the coin flip or random player might win, but given a long enough time period skill would win out.

Otherwise you are just recreating a bunch of centralized ledgers with trusted access, which is what we already have?

I'd be careful attributing exact reasons to price movements...some of what you mentioned might have been involved in the infinite web of cause and effect, but to think you have it all figured out...nope sorry. 
I can write 3 paragraphs citing reasons as to why the trend should have reversed at different points over the last 16 months, but the reality is that the fundamentals haven't been closely related to price movements at all. The market is highly illiquid, if a group of whales see weakness they can influence the market with out any ties to fundamental reasons whatsoever. Most of the time, real events can just serve as opportunities for whales to do what they would have done regardless.

Either more speculative demand from individuals or institutions (since inception this has been the primary influence), or more demand for practical use cases that are either improved by bitcoin, or were not possible before it existed. 
We may be on the brink of seeing some institutional demand, with new platforms that make it easy to gain exposure with out having to learn how to secure the bitcoin itself. But we can't really know if the demand is there until these platforms are actually operational. The price could drop to double digits before that happens for all we know.

With out knowing anything about stellar, let me ask you this...so if the company behind it is shut down, there will be enough incentive for people to become "trusted parties" as you called them and keep it running? 
If so, then that just sounds like an alt-coin, but from what I have heard that's not the case. I was under the impression you needed permission to become a "trusted party". If not, then ya its the same, but bitcoin is a lot more valuable due to it's first move advantage and network effect, and is thus much more secure.

I'm not asking you to do my research for me, my main point was about btc adoption by poker sites and why that not happening is not a forgone conclusion, I don't feel I need to do any research to validate that. If i was trying to prove that it *will* happen that's much harder. Maybe that's valueless to you.

Did I need to be condescended back to and need that experience? Lol, okay i guess so, two wrongs don't make right.


Yes because I thought you were the same person as OP, and your mind was set regardless of what I had to say, and it wasn't worth it or constructive for me to write anymore. I will respond to your comment now, and what I was mainly disagreeing with was the set-in-stone conclusion of the OP, not most of your points.


Umm, they were mostly rhetorical, and purposely condescending in response to the original comment, which okay, I regret. And in terms of doing the research I am someone who used to play tons of poker both online and real for a few years of my life, it wasn't like my job or main source of income or anything so I wouldn't call my self a professional, but there really isn't much you laid out that I haven't heard before, most of which are valid points. But as you might even agree (you are not OP) they are still evidence that support your opinion. I'm not even sure my opinion is all that different then yours for the most part. 
I just feel there is a very decent shot these big poker websites will adopt bitcoin as a funding mechanism as you may be overlooking some benefits it can provide for some people, not everyone is a professional poker player on these sites and may have very different opinions then you on the matter in terms of how frequently they would like to withdraw if doing so was much easier and smoother, not to mention that even people who are professional players may have a totally different strategy then you on bankroll management, how much they use of it each day, and what type of games they plat i.e. cash games, short tournaments, etc. These strategies and preferences may differentiate peoples desires to withdraw at different frequencies. Ill try to give you a better response above. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:15:36


I agree for the most part, but my point was more that bitcoins benefits also come from the fact that it's supply is limited as well as the fact that it's decentralized. Not really that a limited currency is something new, so ya, just look at gold its been around for ages. In other words, I think that aspect is essential, but yes it's not anything revolutionary. 
Sure, other alts have features like what you mentioned but they are yet to prove they can succeed, maybe that will change in the future idk. But there is much less incentive to mine a coin if you know your reward will be infinitely inflated. 
But really I think predictable is more important than the number of units. Dogecoin is an interesting example, I'm not quite sure it would continue to exist (with it's unlimited supply) if it wasn't able to be merge-mined with litecoin, but I won't pretend to be an expert in the matter.

Look you know more than me about how poker sites run, and how to describe risk, but are you really going to tell me there aren't tons of degenerate gamblers and other types of players in between the spectrum of degenerate gambler and professional poker (player who mitigates as much risk as possible) that contribute towards the rake or revenue stream for these sites? 


I'm sorry you feel my comments detract from the discussion, I don't feel that way about yours, I simply feel you are very knowledgeable in the subject and make valid points, but they do not prove your conclusion. You seem to assume every poker site's revenue is solely comprised of what professional poker players contribute, as someone who is not a professional and knows many people like myself that have contributed to this revenue, I don't agree. Feel free to point me to a survey or some statistic that can show how the revenue is broken down but even that is not a complete picture, the term "professional poker player" can mean something to you and something different to someone else. 
What do I mean by a smoother transaction? Well, when I used to play online poker back in the day it could take weeks or months to actually get money to your bank depending on the website, where you lived, and the method. So, with bitcoin you will have your money in 10 minutes, and can convert it to other currencies in a lot less time than mentioned above, thus smoother. But even with that being said, if we are strictly debating whether these poker sites will ever use bitcoin, we also can't rule out the possibility that bitcoin is eventually used for the vast majority of online commerce as a whole, in a world like this, there wouldn't be a need to even convert to other currencies and its even less frictionless. That is what I mean.


The math might not be hard, what is harder is where you draw the line between a "professional" an "aspiring professional" an "amateur" and a "degenerate gambler". And once again I am not talking about any bitcoin denominated poker sites. 
That's all I really have to say about it, I am not really learning much from this, we seem to be speaking on different terms as you would probably agree, sorry if you think i am detracting that is not my intent. I just don't think the picture is as black and white as you claim, I still would not be the least bit surprised if a year from now pokerstars or bovada or any of the other big ones allow bitcoin for deposits and withdrawals, or not. Time will tell.

Ah, seems you know this for a fact, must be nice to be all knowing. Couldn't it be possible other poker players have a different stance then you?


There may be some truth to this, but after all they do deal with risk for living. Is the risk so crazy if you withdraw your daily winnings using bitcoin and immediately convert it into $ using an exchange?


Are you implying there is zero risk in holding $ on one of these or any other online poker sites? Sure, I'll give you the exchange rate risk is much less with dollars compared to bitcoin, but that is only one type of risk


There may be or not be, but this is just a conclusion that in my opinion doesn't logically follow from the evidence you have provided. I'm not convinced.

@_date: 2015-03-26 15:36:01
I think you are both some-what correct. This is the debate that bitcoin enables. 
We always had the power to make money what ever we deem it, but it never happened because we couldn't be organized enough to make it scale. Money could not exist with out man's capacity to produce goods and services, it simply represents our willingness to trade our best efforts with one another for mutual benefit. 
We never needed the state to allow us to do so, and money existed long before the state, but many different collectives used different forms of ledgers or means of exchange. It dates back to tribe members killing a buffalo, and agreeing to exchange parts of it for future compensation through various means, this was tough to keep track of, but for the most part it worked. Now we have the power to all use the same ledger, universal money on such a grand scale was never really achievable with out the state. 
You could argue it already existed at such a scale with precious metals centuries ago, and that's sort of true, but its main bottle neck was the problem of mass, and paper currencies or receipt money was created to flow more freely and represent the physical gold. But in that we created banks and third parties to manage these receipts, and things got out of hand pretty quickly when corruptible individuals and organizations were put in charge maintaining what could be redeemed, and they created more receipts than the amount that backed them. And thus fractional reserve banking and eventually central banks were created, this might be a discussion for another time lol. 
But now money is literally free speech, there is not a thing anyone can do if i walk across the border with a private key in my head, etc. So can you blame all of these gov'ts for trying to regulate the conversion of bitcoin into various fiat currencies and keep what ever threads of control they have left? I mean it's not surprising, it's in their nature to do so, but as bitcoin itself becomes more and more universally accepted, their grips of control will likely whither as times goes on. 
Edit: And to directly address both of your points, it's like one of you is saying it's just information how can someone dare to attempt to stop it from flowing, and the other is responding well no that information represents money so it should be regulated, well that's debatable, from who's perspective? In modern times, gov'ts worry about bad things happening from anyone being able to exchange value with whomever at their own fruition, but in reality this capability always existed, just not at scale. So my perspective as an average citizen, my view is: do you really have the right to prevent me/us from doing what we were always capable of? We can just do it much easier now, and on a grand scale. They will see that as a threat, and i will see it as an opportunity that should vastly outweigh the threat.

There are plenty of well established financial figures who have done more or less just that. Some have quit their jobs and joined start-ups while others have joined the boards of bitcoin companies. The former CEO of the NYSE just joined Terra Exchange, Blythe Masters is getting involved with Digital Asset Holdings, etc.

Fair point, but this is only useful in a truly decentralized system. If there is one or only a few entities running a "blockchain" they can easily break this chain and make it w.e they want it to be by 51% attacking themselves. Which sort of hints at the question of what benefit a closed blockchain even has. 
Without open competition in mining the "chain" part isn't really that useful, the ledger is only immutable and indellible if it everyone and anyone can come to consensus on it thus preventing malicious actors from outpacing the network and changing history.

Someone please explain to me how these supposed ledger(s) controlled and maintained by central banks is any different then what we currently have now. 
Either everyone can mine to secure the network, or you have carefully vetted access to these ledgers authorized by trusted entities. I'm confused. Currency is already digital (for the most part) and exists as units on a ledger of banks, what makes bitcoin different is how it secures the network, it's limited supply, and the benefits which stem from that. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:28:02
Thanks. Haha ya, hey if they can make themselves more efficient and I'm wrong I'm all for it. But regardless, so long as they have different currencies/ledgers/systems interacting they will never be able to be as efficient as a totally open system, so bitcoin will have its place.
Not to mention their system would be full of censorship, and participants in it would need to be trusted, under-developed or war-torn nations' systems would likely still be left out, yet their citizens can use bitcoin if they have a simple dumb phone. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:43:16
They are dumping it into start-ups that will help bitcoin reach it's potential, they are building the infastructure. I'm sure some of the ceo's themselves are buying and already own bitcoin, but it wouldn't make much sense for the firms themselves to simply buy bitcoin and hope for the best. 
They are funding the evolution of it. If it all comes to frution, bitcoin is wildly succesful, and the price sky rockets, so to will the companie's valuations (that they are investing in).
Not to mention, as an individual looking to buy large amounts of bitcoin, the smartest strategy for you would be to quietly accumulate as much as possible with out anyone knowing and hope not to have an effect on the price. It's not as if it's smart to pay the spread and buy up the market, quite the contrary. But at a certain point if enough people are quietly accumulating the an inflection point will be reached.

Ya, I watched it the other day, it's great as are all of his videos. You can think of blocks as folders, data, etc it's all true and works. The point is that bitcoin is special due to the fact that we all manage the data as opposed to carefully trusted participants.

Again, this was sort of rhetorical and condescending, as his comment seemed to be a blanket statement with no evidence to support it, your comment has more substance. I am basically pointing out it in a tongue-in-cheek way (maybe it didn't come off like this) that yes they obviously do deal with risk for a living. And sure as you mention they aim to minimize that risk, but lets be real they have a huge appetite for risk if they are willing to keep their money on these shady websites in order to be able to perform, I don't knock it, there was a time when I used to play on these sites all the time as well. And you have to be very careful with how much money you keep on the site and for how long, and continually make sure the withdrawal methods are still operating smoothly and the company isn't about to shut down, etc. But if you wanted to play poker online, and reap its benefits, you had to deal with this risk. 
So, I was basically just saying anyone who plays tons of online poker is taking on huge risks in various forms, not just from the game of poker itself, but from the counterpartys, etc. You may say "WELL OKAY HOW DOES ADDING BITCOIN MITIGATE THIS RISK?" and that's fair, but my point is not that bitcoin solves all of this, but rather these people naturally already have big risk appetites if they are playing in the first place, to me it only makes sense that a certain % of them wouldn't mind taking on the additional exchange rate risk for small periods of time, hey even a small % may enjoy the extra risk/return. But isn't that making poker even more of gamble and less skill? Yes, but I am talking a small % and not everyone who plays online poker is a professional, there are tons who are amateurs or even just pure gamblers and poker is one of the many forms of gambling they do. 


Hmm, well i'm more referring to the blanket statement that it will not dominate the poker scene, from my view its not likely people will flock to bitcoin dominated poker sites, but actually that the top sites will offer bitcoin as a funding/withdrawal method in addition to their current methods, there is not a huge amount of downside to it. A few costs, but it may be worth a try for them if there is real demand to use a smoother method of transacting. There has been a bunch of rumors about one of the bigger ones I forget which one (maybe pokerstars?) that is already researching possibly using it, I think Johnny Chan is coming out with a new site if I remember correctly that will offer it, but I could be wrong. 


Okay, so again just another miscommunication, if anything I believe bitcoin has a shot being implemented with some of the bigger sites, or new sites that offer both methods side by side. Not really so much a bitcoin denominated site. Although I do think if bitcoin ever succeeds with other use-cases and gains a bigger use case, those sites could catch on as well, but I'm definitely not implying they are just going to steal all the current online players from the big sites as things are or anything like that.  


I didn't know there was only one way of being a poker pro, but sure I guess most of the professionals have very rigid risk management/bankroll management strategies they stick to at regularly scheduled intervals, but there may be some with less conservative strategies. But okay, let's assume every single professional withdraws at regularly scheduled intervals with no room for different circumstances of how much they won in a session, etc, and lets assume none of them choose an interval of every day, maybe if the withdrawal method was more instantaneous there could be more demand to actually withdraw every day. 
Further, this all assumes that everyone who plays online poker is a professional, and that's totally not true. There are many different types of players who play, all with different aversions to risk, and different desires in how frequently they might wish to withdraw.


You seem to have a picture in your mind of a certain type of player (professional) with a certain rigid schedule of withdrawal and set in stone risk management procedures. Okay, i'm sure there are plenty of those players out there, but they do not represent the whole market of online poker and not to mention the prospective market of new users who might play in the future. Your example seems like a good one, but it's very narrow in scope. I don't blame you if you just thought my whole argument was that professional poker player will all flock to using bitcoin, it is not, it is that we don't know if the industry as a whole could benefit from implementing bitcoin, maybe you believe you know, but personally i'm not so sure. I wouldn't be surprised at all if some of the top sites added it if and when bitcoin becomes more ubiquitous.

You could say the same thing about poker. I would say the people who are good at it are the ones who can make money in the long run, and manage their risk appropriately. Thus you can't really tell who will be "good" at poker until they have played for a long time, and proven they are actually "good" and not just lucky. 
Any poker player can make a really smart move, and catch a bad beat, but it wont hurt them in the long run if they know what they are doing. Same thing with making a bad trade. The best poker players or traders can predict high probability moves, and manage the risk well. The outcome of each individual move is irrelevant, if you are truly predicting with high probability, then you will benefit in the long run due to the law of large numbers.
I think the comparison is a good one, 90% of people who play poker suck, and can win on a given day or lose on a given day. If you are really good you can win or lose on any given day as well. But there has to be some reason players can make it through the field of thousands of players all the way to the final table, multiple times in their life.

Great question. First off, would it really be a "closed decentralized system" or is that really just another way of saying a centralized system. Or in other words access to the ledger is centralized. 
But I think you are getting at the fact that they would actually be mining blocks in this closed network. So, would that work? I would imagine, so long as they keep the network/ledger/mining algo secret enough, sure it would work. But the real question isn't really would that work or not, it's more about what actual benefit would that bring? It's an added layer of complexity. 
I won't pretend I know the intricacies of fedwire, swift, and interbank transfers, but I think the costs in both time and fees to complete transfers are due to the fact that settlement is between many different banks and systems that are not universal. Not to mention each one of these entities has costs to cover in the form of labor and overhead. 
So, if every central bank has it's own closed crypto system, I don't see why the costs to transfer value in between these systems would magically disappear. Unless of course they all used one system, and made it open to everyone, but now we have effectively recreated bitcoin. 
Further, what you are describing may not even be all that different from what central banks use, they all have clever crypography I'm sure to secure their ledger, and probably even process their transactions in batches, but they certainly don't have proof of work because that is the decentralized part of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:08:18
Thanks for your comment, I think I agree for the most part but this: 




sort of conflicts with this:


Unless you simply mean transparent only to the small number of central banks plugging into this. In other words you and I would not have access to this ledger. 
So, as I was saying in another comment, i don't think what you are describing is not possible, I only question what real advantages it would have over the current systems. I suppose if they didn't each have their own blockchain, and it was one *distributed* (I say that with a grain of salt) system then it could possibly be a bit more efficient then what they have. 
But even if we assume all the major central banks kicked some ass and were able to organize and collaborate to create this system, it would still be only open to the same carefully vetted participants as it is today, and these member banks would have the same requirements for their customers of having proper documentation, creditworthiness, etc. 
So in this theoretical system, I don't see how the billions of people with mismanaged central banks/poor or non-existent banking infrastructures will then magically gain access. It's not as if they can just use their dumb phone as they can with bitcoin, they need to be approved by someone to get involved at one layer or another. 
Would you agree?

Right, well they didn't actually "disappear" but rather you would say Mt Gox lost control over them at some point or another. It's widely debated when and how this happened, as they were not very transparent about their customer deposits. They had a lot of problems over the years, and many doubted their solvency and professionalism, yet back in the day they were basically the only place to buy bitcoins, things have changed a lot since then.
Hence the push in recent years to make exchanges prove that they have 100% of customer's btc on hand, which can be easily done if the exchange is willing. 
Basically, when you own a bitcoin what that really means is that only you know the "private key" or in other words, the password which enables you to move the bitcoins or spend them to another address. So, any bitcoins that were ever in the possesion of mt gox could not have "disappeared", but rather mt gox themselves lost the private keys which control them, or a hacker was able to gain access to them due to poor security measures, and send them to an address of which he/she controls.
Had mt gox kept with the standards that are being employed today by some of the better exchanges, the whole debacle couldn't have happened, because customers would be able to see that their coins are attached to a certain address on the public ledger, and mt gox could prove they have control over them. Since this was not the case (other than I believe the ceo moving *some coins* in 2011? 2012? to appease worried customers) some even doubt whether they had anywhere near 850,000 coins at the time they claimed to have suffered the loss, but rather they believe mt gox was in essence running a ponzi scheme trying to make up for earlier losses of btc in prior years.

Is your service targeting merchants or users? It seems plenty of merchants are increasingly accepting bitcoin, I'm not so sure they are being impeded by the anonymity of bitcoin. Don't they have customer information anyway when they ship them the goods? What would this contribute outside of adding another intermediary to keep a database of customer info that could potentially be hacked.

He recently said in an interview that litecoin can not succeed until bitcoin succeeds (obviously) and that one of the two main reasons he is working at coinbase is to convince them to accept litecoin *when it's ready.* And its obviously no where near ready yet, as bitcoin itself has a long way to go before it's mainstream. 
I think litecoin is in a separate category from all other alts, it has been able to sustain an incredible hash rate alongside bitcoin. And it's not as if that is detracting from bitcoin in any way. 
I totally agree with the substance of what Armstrong is saying though. He can still maintain that position and be okay with 1% or less of the alts surviving.

He literally argued the opposite of every pundit who usually says "oh the payment system/blockchain is great, but the currency is a joke" which makes no sense and he provided no evidence to back it up. Obviously both are necessary as the blockchain won't work with out incentives, but where is the substance in arguing for the currency but not the payment system.
This whole convo provided absolutley no value for me, the only reason i was watching was because it was Peter Thiel. Can we get rid of this ridiculous argument that bitcoin some how needs to take over the US $ or even fiat money altogether to be successful? Its utter bull shit.

Trading is, to an extent, a zero-sum game, when you consider this point, I have a hard time understanding how statistics can show that "TA" as a skill, does not work. If it works for small % of traders who have an edge, and the vast majority loses...is it "working" ?
In other words, you can say texas hold em is just pure gambling, but clearly there are players who have had decades long careers proving this wrong, if they represent the small % who it "works" for (who have an edge over the rest using skills in risk assesement, etc etc) is it fair to say that no one can be a skillful poker player?
I guess what I am getting at is, your blanket statement sounds spurious to me, I would gladly take the performance of a few experienced proven traders over my mom trying to trade any day of the week.
