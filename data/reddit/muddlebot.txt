The healthy level was more around $1k, it’s all been pump and hype since that point

A 22 year prediction is 22 years you get to come up with an excuse as to why it didn’t happen that way

That phrase is just the disclaimer scumbags use to put the blame on you.
When people say “only invest what you can afford to lose!” in crypto it’s the same as in a ponzi scheme - they want more people like you to buy in so they can cash out, but they don’t want the guilt of potentially leaving you holding the bag... so if they throw in that little disclaimer at the start they can walk away with your money and a clear conscience.
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:30:27
lol. Are you really going to blame “FUD” when it drops well below $10k? Was it “FUD” that also dropped it from $20k?
The only FUD surrounding btc was the fomo spread promoting it as the price was artificially pumped.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:13:52
Oh please... FUD doesn’t even apply to bitcoin. There’s only two types of bitcoin owners - those that believe in the tech and those that believe in the price. FUD has no effect on the first group and the second group have no business owning any bitcoin. If FUD bothers you then you’re part of group two.
Besides, what I say is the truth. Tether pumping started the same time bitcoin’s uncanny growth began, that much is fact.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:17:07
$300 billion market cap doesn’t mean $300 billion has been put into it.... its just a multiplication of today’s rate. $1.7 billion tether could have easily created the inflated value we see today by halting crashes and promoting surges... 
...and that’s just tether. You’re forgetting your evil nemesis fiat, which institutions print to suppress you. How much institutional money do you reckon is in crypto inflating it’s value... and how much of that do you reckon the banks and law makers are going to make you and everyone else pay back in your taxes and fees...?

Because if you fork the coin you admit it’s not worth anything. Btc grew in popularity due to fomo... the bs artists of the world spread the idea that it’s some immutable, scarce and desirable thing, when in reality it’s a pretty rubbish prototype of blockchain potential. Forking it would be like admitting that as well as opening the doorway to future forks and also making the coin too complicated for the average person to bother with.

You hodl because memes told you to hodl while the meme makers pump and dump the shit out of the ecosystem you’re supporting for them... and the “you only lose if you sell” mentality is another memester trick... you don’t have money until it’s deposited into your bank account brudda...
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:25:31
I’m part of the millenial generation and I have to agree with you. Millenials have been raised to believe their intelligent, important, unique, etc. without actually being so. Furthermore media has fried whatever little brains we have left... so now humanity’s future rests in the hands of people who think they’re the centre of the universe despite being incapable of doing anything for themselves.... and who’s entire thought process is dictated by social media feeds.
To make matters even worse, thanks to bitcoin we’ve discovered millenials are so dumb they can literally be sold a fraction of nothing for top dollar and they think they’ve scored a bargain. Morons :(
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:21:58
You miss the implications of what being bought in fiat means.
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:40:29
lol it’s all bs. Tether pumping kicked off and maintained the 2017 price rise... $1k was the real value of btc back then but that was when it was used for illicit activities.... since the pumping brought so much attention to btc the illicit crowd has mostly bailed to alts and so it’s real value would be much, much less... probably closer to $100 than $1000
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:15:03
Trolling me isn’t going to change reality
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:40:31
Men don’t give in to fomo or greed and buy into crypto in the first place. Let this be a lesson to you young one
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:02:43
It’s bought in fiat dude.... it’s just another toy for the 1% to play with the 99...
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:20:01
Crypto died with mt gox and was resurrected by dozens of schemers that saw the opportunity to get rich. If crypto was ever going to be an escape from the wagecuck it needed to be built around a fair distribution method and application as an actual currency rather than just another way to accumulate fiat wealth.
The future of crypto now lies in the hands of the banks, governments and companies that will build and devise their own applications for crypto/blockchain. Good job people

if you use a loan what do you think happens with the money? Do you think the entity you paid just keeps the money on the floor somewhere? They put it back in the bank...
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:33:19
Actually yes, the memes helped hype bitcoin and raised the price to $20k... the problem is though hype (and price manipulation) was all they had to offer and now that it’s run out bitcoin is falling back towards a more realistic value.
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:38:48
Because they either:
a) want to see their $100 investment turn into $1 million like promised or...
b) were the poor fools that bought in at $20k and have only been in crypto for a month 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:14:32
 When they say stuff like this they are just using peer pressure to try and edge those on the sidelines in... they know they need new money in for their investment to bounce back and this is all they can do
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:54:50
It ‘was’ really worth $1k back before the pumping, tether and social media hype/fomo created an enormous bubble... but that was because it was used for illicit activities. Thanks to it’s growth a lot of those illicit transactions have moved on to other coins, so it’s real value should be even less.... however we won’t see this value for quite a while as there will be a lot of stubborn and desperate people trying to keep their dying dreams alive...
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:25:12
People like jargon; they think they know something others don’t which makes them feel smart when everyone else is telling them they are making stupid decisions 
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:35:15
It wouldn’t have been more than $10 billion usd and a few billion tethers
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:10:07
lol you can’t put magic internet money in the toilet, that’s like trying to flush a fart
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:36:21
Those things don’t matter. Bitcoin died with mt gox and schemers revived it because they saw a way to make money by selling nothing at a premium price... many people fell for it and got burnt badly... and many more haven’t even realised how badly burnt they are yet. The only way it goes up is if schemers continue to pump it or the banks see potential to keep making money off an open market, but I don’t really see why they would
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:28:02
It’s going to take at least a week to get down that low
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:06:33
It’s funny you consider these people scumbags when they are the same people that tried to prevent you from losing money in the first place.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:31:15
You’re wrong. Memes are senseless distractions from critical thinking. At least this guy wants to see something productive occur in these space, that’s more than the btc devs have achieved in years
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:34:52
He probably got hooker dickrot years ago and his dick is pickling in a jar somewhere
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:38:21
Okay great well you sit their scrolling through your memes smart guy, I’m sure that’ll help
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:30:59
When people start using terms like ‘believe’ and ‘faith’ you know it’s total bullshit
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:43:27
Bitcoin ass payment method sounds like a quick way to make up for your losses
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:21:25
Nice
