2nd layer. Probably a bit less secure and decentralized, but if that ever bothers anyone they can just revert back to the base layer (bitcoin)

Im pretty down for some 6k btc

What but dan is such a nice guy he would never do such a thing! ��

I think so, at least on my page the last trade was at 9:50 (25 minutes ago) 
edit: its back up

Futures markets, alt coins, institutional investors... forget that fluff we need to get back to our roots. Memes are our ticket to the moon don't you forget it!! ��

Too centralised, santa need to be replaced by a doa
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:13:13
Yup I'd agree. However I think that will change with time. That's why people are buying it now right? Get in while its still relatively unused and spread it out towards mass adoption
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:00
But wait there's more! Buy now and get an additional 25% discount!

Not 100% since I don't know if each of these wallets represent an unique individual, but a good way to get a general estimate
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:55:41
Clearly I'm not smart enough to have conversation with you. Happy holidays :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:47:20
Yeah after I posted my comment, I noticed a bunch of other people had mentioned it as well. Just like everyone on here I'm hoping all these coins go through the roof, just make sure to only invest what you can afford to lose. Anyhow, congrats on the investment, and best of luck! ����
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:07:01
This is something easily fixed by smarter management by wallets. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:42:46
Doesn't surprise me, but I also don't think it's alright. It's too easy to be cynical 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:58:21
Personally the current utility of a Bitcoin just isn't there for me, so I feel like owning it is mainly speculative. I hope that in the near future having some Bitcoin will be legitimately useful in a way that makes the price I got it for seem like a discount. When it's fast, nearly free and widely accepted, due to scaling solutions becoming a reality and mass adoption I think it will be simply easier to use than cash, especially with improvements to wallets/front end tech. At that point the market price will hopefully be much higher than today, although unfortunately I don't have a specific estimate in mind in terms of price just yet, mainly.as I'm not sure how much the future will be in Bitcoin or alts, and how much time it will take to reach mass adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:40:00
Better yet check the guys Twitter and see he's obviously joking

Well you call him an idiot, state a bunch of false facts about Bitcoin, then call him stupid again, regardless of your opinion you kind of just being a dick. So yeah sorry for missing that " basic fact"

No money on GDAX.. HOW DO I BUY THE DIP T-T (jk I can use coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:33:03
Well at least you had 86k to throw at this? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:34:15
Not that you have a choice, but HODL! :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:31:09
Just hope the the fees aren't too much of a drag for those smaller purchases. Might not be worth the effort but GDAX can save a few bucks, especially for these smaller orders.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:34:17
For lots of people this is their first dip, and this one was definitely worse than the ones earlier this year
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:37:18
Wtf go back to buttcoin

Lalallala I can't hear you if I plug my ears and yell 'fud' a lot. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:37:35
I feel like a decent amount of liberal media are sort of against it, or at least skeptical. Which is a bit weird to me, but I could just be the massive presence of extremely libertarian/right wing who are super into Bitcoin.. I swear the strongest cases against crypto I see are from Twitter and Reddit users who are super pro-crypto and also batshit insane.. like the subset of Twitter that consists of crypto-traders who love ayn rand and swear by Paleo/carnivore diets
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:14:06
Don't think that's what shilling means...
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:47:51
Response 2, now that I reread your comment: Miners pay for electricity, and need to maximize revenue to make any sort of profits as the mining space is extremely competitive. Miners who are filling their own blocks with spam txs that have high fees are going to miss out on legit transactions which pay them money. Either that or other miners who win the block will include their 'spam' tx and take that fee money, meaning a large loss for that spamming miner. So if they don't play by the rules they will eventually run out of money.
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:11:10
To go full tin foil hat here, a state level actor could easily use as an attack this to justify a full crypto ban. I don't personally have any reason to think the images/links mentioned were done for this reason (more likely some sick bastard). Honestly if they could use btc's public nature to track down the wallet/individuals that posted this, that would be kind hilarious. Very doubtful that would be possible but still..
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:22:20
But for these file storage/hosting, the files are not publicly available. Maybe links exist to encrypted illegal  content, but in that case someone must also provide a key to unlock it. With the block chain, it's public- no encryption, anyone can access, with no way to delete it
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:26:12
You may think that the benefits outweigh the risks, but what about the average person? I'm worried about the effect this will have on adoption. A hard fork could remove it, but it's going to be a heated debate to say the least..
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:15:13
I think the overlap between bitcoin and spaceX fans is really awesome, I guess it may be an interest and age thing :) You bet I was watching that launch!
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:51:20
Its still in beta, I don't think anyone wants to see a headline 'millions of users funds lost due to exchanges use of unfinished software'
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:26:20
Fair and i was just giving an example why your theoretical spam attack wouldn't work, and why it would only inflate tx prices for a short period before they ran out of money
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:39:12
I'm scared I'll miss out on a big dip and then FOMO into a bull trap
@_date: 2018-03-21 08:17:55
If it hard forks once, what's to stop it from doing it again? Slippery slope sort of logic here. If I make a transaction, can I reverse it/ double spend by including really messed up stuff in the unlocking script? This.is a really tricky issue imo.. don't think there's a simple answer to this
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:22:08
51% attacks are a very serious issue. This is true for basically any crypto. If a single entity controls a majority of the miners/validators (for PoW, or PoS) you are going to have bigger issues than mining fees
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:31:48
Kinda like your refrigerator 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:00:53
You'll feel a lot better knowing you made your own decisions, which makes life way easier when crazy stuff like this dip happens. Even if you lose, if you go in with the mindset that its a calculated risk, and you are willing to lose a bit, its not nearly as scary as jumping in and vaguely hoping prices are going to just go up. Less regret when i can say "yeah it was a gamble, I sort of expected this to happen, better luck next time." Also if you feel good about the long term (which is going to based off personal research and beliefs), then this sort of stuff is like discount time :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:25:39
This is why I want to see price drop some more, and shake out all those dumb money weak hands

Except miners are decentralized, and miners don't set fees. When individuals generate transactions, they optionally include a fee. The size of that fee is up to the user. Miners simply listen for txs and chose to include them in their blocks, with preference for including txs that include larger fees. (I.e higher priority in the mempool)
If there are not enough txs with high fees (basic economics here, for example some users may refuse to pay $5, i.e. those trying to make small purchases) then miners can either include those txs that have the lower fees or mine blocks that are unfilled, which is equivalent to saying no to free money. While some miners may do this, they will be less profitable, so any miners who are economically motivated (and not a malicious actor) will accept the lower tx in their blocks. If a minority of miners colluded in this way, the network would be a bit less efficient and increase fees by a small amount but these miners would be collectively less profitable, since they are forgoing txs and basically making way less as a result. Other miners would make more profits since they have more txs to include  in their blocks, ensuring  full blocks, so honest miners would be more profitable. If a majority of miners colluded, you have bigger issues than tx fees.
@_date: 2018-02-13 01:52:49
Fees are a solution, if it becomes expensive to spam the network, the attacker will eventually run out of funds. Basic economics there
