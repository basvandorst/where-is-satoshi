Just enough to get me back on my feet and the rest would go into a trust account for my daughter.

that rarely helps... Plenty of news reports and people with lawyers. Most still don't get their money back. Plenty of news reports on that as well. I'm in Canada and i've seen them so..

One always wishes to have that happen to themselves, but i'm very glad it happens to others. Keeps my faith in humanity alive. Besides, not everyone can handle the struggle. I can.

haha yeah At least there's one silver lining in this

I'm poor and sleeping  at friends places for now. But i have started mining at nicehash and hope i can make enough this year to start playing the market and hopefully make something good out of it

I was a passenger in a vehicle that got t-boned by someone else running a stop sign.

Hell, a fraction of a bitcoin could save my life right about now. Word of advice, if you are the victim of a bad car accident that you're not at fault, make sure you have a good lawyer. I didn't.

get over yourself
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:52:33
you missed the part where i said get a good lawyer.

you may not be rich but you're behaving like one lol
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:24:50
i didn't say he was rich. I'm quite glad he can afford luxuries. I think everyone deserves luxuries. But he's behaving in a way i don't personally approve of
@_date: 2018-05-26 21:36:21
congrats.. you are now behaving like a rich asshole. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:27:50
I'm not dissing your success. I'm quite glad and encourage it. Everyone should have some success and enjoy some luxuries. It was your behavior i had an issue with. 
And with that said, Happy boating

i don't know, but if you're in the same situation im in, i'd say sell a few so you can eat a proper meal for the first time in a long while, and maybe hold on to most of it

im a week away from homelessness and wish i could find my very first wallet. When bitcoin first came out i have mined some and had like 20  bitcoins.. This would literally change my life
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:06:39
its been a goner for a long time. PC fried and the place that had my wallet changed to a different company. I'm not knowledgeable enough with bitcoins to do anything about it
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:35:42
Ive been homeless before a long time ago , i know how to survive it. I do appreciate the suggestion and think its a wonderful idea.
