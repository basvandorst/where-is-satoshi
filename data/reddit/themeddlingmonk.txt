initialisms only do you good if your reader knows what they mean. If it isn't in common usage write the whole thing out. It takes less work for you to that than to have everyone of your readers try to look it up.

Even if OP is 80, why does his age matter? I know a good number old folk that I wouldn't want take financial advice from.

The difficulty is changed every 2016 blocks. It is adjusted so that a block will be found every 10 minutes.

The mining difficulty is supposed to adjust to an influx of new hashing power. Bitcoins are supposed to be payed out to miners at a fixed rate.

I think (as stated somewhere else in this thread) that the point is that eventually if enough people are using Bitcoin then merchants would have to always trade their coins for cash. They could buy things they needed for their store or whatnot with coins.

It isn't a commodity like some sort of agricultural product or a mined metal. Things that have other values besides their value as currency. I may be confusing commodities and fiat vs nonfiat currencies.

I wouldn't use it to generate QR code for private keys. While I doubt the author wrote it with intent to steal bitcoin, you don't know what the server is logging. They have a windows binary that you can download at the link the posted below. That might be safer especially if you refuse the app network access.

That's what a lot of people have been using it for, but it isn't what it was created for and it won't last very long if it is all that it is used for. Bitcoins as a commodity is stupid because it has no inherent value. If Bitcoin is only a commodity it is destined to fail. Bitcoin as a currency has a potential for a great many things, such as getting away from using centralized banks as the OP suggested.

I'd buy a Tesla.
