Imagine if Satoshi's ultimate goal was to sucker super rich people into buying into tons of BTC then once they were in crash the value by dumping everything he had.

But an attacker don't have the public key. He has a double hash of the public key. My understanding is that quantum computers don't have an advantage in reversing a cryptographically secure hash.

Even the creator of LiteCoin says it's the "silver" to BitCoin's "gold". BTC is the 800 lb gorilla by fiat (pardon the pun).

Apologies for my ignorance, but what fundamentals would you be talking about?

Ha, he could change the world by suckering everyone into BTC and then dumping everything he has. That would be an ultimate fuck you by a spiritually enlighted person to a world obsessed with money. To the point where they worship and expend a huge amount of both human and terrestrial resources to support a tamper-proof (but energy hungry) digital creation. This could be a some sick science fiction plot that we're a part of!

There's a bit of a chicken/egg problem...you have to create the desired configuration before you run the GUI for the first time.
 thanks for that, I'm running the GUI version because I'm a newb and I couldn't get the CLI version to work.
