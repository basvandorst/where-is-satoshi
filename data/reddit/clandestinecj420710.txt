unfortunatley it is all greek to me.
I paid .0004+ tx fee on electrum for a .003 yransfer and it hasnt had one confirmation all day/last night.

i tried using accelerator and it says transaction does not exist. Did i lose my money?

how do you find the size of the transaction? and is there anyway i can unstuck this transaction i have on electrum. had been saying eithing 25 blocks all day now and i bumped fee up to .0004 something and its only a 45 dollar transaction. though the wallet says 41kb next to it.

So unless i spend 30 dollars or more it probably wont get confirmed for days? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:22:41
So it will go through eventually? I have patience. Just dont want to lose my money.
What about the other one that has a low fee then? Doesnt even give me an estimate for a confirmation, I imagine that will go through too? 
What sucks is that TX i sent you wont even pop up on pool.btc accelerator. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:42:37
would it even be worth making purchases from electrum wallet at this point in time with how the tx fees are? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:22:08
im confused
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:48:18
So I should probably hold off on purchases for a few days?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:34:00
i dont understand the sats per byte thing or how to determine it. wish there was a simple calculator
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:26:50
like an hour or two tops. could care less if it took a few honestly but i dont want to wait days
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:17:59
is it going to lose value more though?

If you can't beat em, join em.

you are in a dip it's only going to go up in the end. last year it was 700 bucks now it's 8000. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:34:04
Great point!

Oh yeah I forgot DHL sends you an invoice. Just say fuck it if it too much. You'll still get it delivered. They usually send an invoice after. This was years ago though.
