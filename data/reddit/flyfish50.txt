We played trivia last night and I thought the Bolivar was Bolivia’s currency. We lost.

Good resource. I noticed a lot of these want a small transaction unlike the bitcoin cash and gold forks. Has anyone claimed any of these others? There is a solid disclaimer on there to be careful,which is nice.

Yea I remember his solid gold credit card.

In San Fran? Not much. But it is about 50kg in twenties.

Funny, I was just doing exactly that. And I bought some more!!
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:34:08
No kidding. I was waiting for re-verification from Coinbase and kraken during the dip.

Why is genital jar capitalized? Makes it sound like a metal band. I had a good laugh at that tho.

Bitcoinbeginners is useful. I’m on there all the time. You’ll get less judgement, but take advice with a grain of salt. If you’re not American- that means don’t rely on it 100% sorry to sound pedantic.

My Dad and people I work with still laugh at me or think I'm crazy. They will be the first to point out when it dips. Ignore and buy the dip!

Don’t update! The new os is the devil. Of course you’ll get annoyed and do it anyway. Like all of us lemmings.

Bitaddress.org is a good place to generate an offline paper wallet. Save the website and it will work offline.  Keeps your private key extra safe. Trezor is a step up if you want to spend $100.

In Europe they use lower flight levels. Like down to FL060 is as low as I can remember at Heathrow.

I saw a few videos referencing that. Mine were in cold storage at the time. I think they address it on their website. I didn’t research it because it didn’t apply to my situation. I think you will still be able to claim them, though.

I’ll pull out when I retire in 30 years. And I’ll keep buying in the whole time, along with bonds and equities.

Good to know. I gave those people my social. ��

I'm only buying, not selling. If it goes to $300 again, I'm buying a metric shit load.

Is it pronounced heriss of her-ass? Fucking network news and their polished dialect.

You gotta buy the coins directly and not transfer fiat first. They will lock in your price when you hit "buy." It will be a small fee, but if you don't care, then go for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:10:34
That's what I'm doing. You can buy .00000001, but Coinbase charges a $1.49 fee, so that amount is not worth it. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:16:31
Indeed. Diversify. Especially when the rest are pretty cheap right now.

I like to fish, too. Walleye, perch, bass. Good luck.

I flubbed the deposit amounts. Format was wrong on the iPhone. 3x and now I can’t get verified again. I’m trying at about 50% because hodling is ok. Maybe it’s not such a bad thing.

How much carbon does it take to run a US mint? A lot, I’d imagine.

I use an iPad for Jepp charts, QRH checklists, and company manuals. Paperless cockpit. Pretty common.

You have a good point, but that's probably why it's 1/7 the value of BTC. Maybe it's a bargain now. Who the hell knows.

Yea, good quote. I’m always broke when everyone is fearful, so I can’t capitalize. Life is long, tho

well done, sir. $100,000 in 1 year.

Many of the guides are pretty bad. The youtube videos are annoying. I split it and posted on this thread. PM me with questions. It was a bit of a learning curve.

I did the same at about $650 a few days ago. I used Bittrex, but now I realize that you can't put fiat into Bittrex yet, so Kraken might be a better option. Here's what I learned:
1. Check the BCC block explorer with your pre fork public address to make sure you have BCC.
2. Transfer your BTC to a new BTC wallet, keeping the old wallet private key. It is now "empty" of BTC, but there is BCC hiding on there.
3. Open an Electron Cash (BCC) wallet for Bitcoin Cash with the empty private key.
3. Boom, you have $1000 worth of Bitcoin Cash. (assuming 1.0ish Bitcoins).
4. Either keep BCC or send it to Bittrex or Kraken and trade into the currency of your choosing.
5. Send it back to an offline wallet for hodling, or keep it on the exchange if you are going to try to *laugh* beat the market.
6. My fees were about $1.00 total for all of this. The transfers all took between 15 minutes to two hours.

I like the cut of your jib. But the government will find a way to get their greasy paws into this game. How long did it take them to start taxing amazon sales? 8-10 years? I'm picturing Cruz's sweaty rat face convincing some congressional panel that bitcoin needs a "bitcoin oversight committee" or decrying its use by sinners and dope fiends to justify taxing the anonymous transactions.
