Precisely.  I just transferred all my btc to gdax while I wait for Gemini confirmation.  And LTC to binance 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:40:19
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:34:40

This one?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:35:43
How much iota were you trying to withdraw?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:12:06
Likewise.  They did not prepare for coinbase to shit the bed with their clientele and have an army at their doorstep waiting to get in.  I’m on day 5 of verification, but I’ll gladly wait and trade on gdax in the meantime.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:44:55
Do you know anyone personally that owns btc?  Best thing would be to set up a wallet and have that person transfer you btc as you slowly pay him/her in cash.

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:12:20
That’s bone 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:30:52
I didn’t becasue coinbase is a fucking shit show and I haven’t been confirmed on Gemini yet.  Oh well.

need to have some signs of buying
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:50:16
Don’t. You’re fine.  As long as you haven’t been on an exchange or made a purchase of more than 10k.   I wouldn’t worry about it.

You do realize that tethers are used to purchase many crypto currencies, including BCash, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:09:53
Gemini is the 1st licensed bitcoin broker in USA...they seem very credible and have invested a lot of money in their infrastructure.  And the owners have a vested interest 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:07:07
A million dollars is jack shit for a hedge fund.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:25:59

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:15:11

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:39:45
what else are you going to do?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:20:27
Gdax is coinbase but you cant transfer LTC into gdax
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:07:29
butt hurt over that massive sell wall and inevitable bcash plummet, aye?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:16:45

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:16:30
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:33:15
Only thing I don’t like about binance is their BtC is always lower than any other exchange becasue they require all alt coin purchase in bitcoin and by doing that they limit your purchasing power.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:16:57

$8500 was never the price.  That was just coinbase mobile price that was frozen.

Cute chart.  The only problem is...bitcoin is not a stock (which is where that paradigm model was created for) and cannot be analyzed like one.  That’s what all these Wall Street and economic professor hacks don’t fucking get.

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:02:11
This is going to happen a lot.  The rise in bitcoin is going to make a lot of people uneasy.  It threatens their entire belief system.  Best to not feed the trolls and let them die.

Or you can read 700 other threads created on the same topic.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:21:55
Price moved while you were in the process.  But it's no secret.  Coinbase is a premium site with excellent security and interface. you're going to pay a little extra. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:02:32
It means it's being pumped to certain levels so it can be dumped.  I don't mean to fear monger but this is unprecedented movement.

Nah man.  You have the wrong guy.  
Same team here.  
And I'm not the one who's fear mongering.  Tether's shady persona/activity is causing it.  And I admire your ability to shrug it off and I certainly hope it's nothing.  But....sure seems there is something.

This is nuts.  I'm loving it but anyone concerned this is a pump?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:10:56
I'm kinda sick of Coinbase's spot price to be honest.  Buy price is higher than 95% of other exchanges and sell price always at the bottom.of the barrel.  They sure squeeze you for every penny they can get.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:33:44
All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:15:46
Thx.  Still curious as to why they don't present their volume.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:21:30
Obviously you don't want to buy at all time highs but if you think it's going to 10K and beyond.   Pull the trigger.   You're in the "dip"
