Sending money by mistake doesn't make it a gift. I think there may be legal options. If your bank accidentally credits your account with money, they can go after you for the funds.

Web design, branding work etc. Racked up a decent amount of BTC without ever spending a dime.

Thanks for the clear response. This is quite confusing and I got sucked into bitcoin because clients were paying me for design work in bitcoins. Now I'm hooked! Time to get educated!!
