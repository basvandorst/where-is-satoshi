no. you ask your HR office or whoever writes the checks to do it in BTC instead. then you have a conversation about it and then you get shotdown because adoption isn't at that point. but atleast you might've changed someone's mind about it and they start to adopt into btc. but dont go third party..you'll likely lose 10% on price and you're employer wont give a shit about crypto

only reason it's high is because the mental stress of possibly losing all of your 40% income instantly. what people dont realize that when it comes to actual investments, short term or long, is that it can take a mental toll if you put in too much and it immediately goes the opposite direction youd want. putting in what you can afford to lose is a good strategy to overcome this. if you can put in 40% of your income and no bat an eye when BTC is going down/up/down/down/etc then i applaud you lol. (i applaud myself for keeping what i have through 2017 till now tbh lol). now im just DCA small amounts
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:47:11
millionaire/billionaire rich, i doubt it. but to gain some big financial edge, i think so. it may be the best investment since you can literally buy $1 worth; unlike other investments that have a set price like a stock.

world hunger isn't a problem due to lack of. its a problem due to "if i can't sell this, ima just throw it away instead." most, if not all, places that produce food have enough to feed the world. but logistics and distribution might be lacking, and "ugly" looking food and produce gets thrown away. along with anything that doesn't sell in a quick enough time.

"Rich" means you've paid your housing, food, health, water, and still have money left over for anything you want; including additional investing/hobbies/vacations/etc. the amount you need to be rich changes depending on where you live and the average cost of living there. it also changes depending on the hobbies and interests of each person to be fulfilled. and yes the avg person can become rich even if all they have is $5 a week. especially if they started buying in around 2010-2011. can they do it now, who knows.

tl;dr - everyone who does TA has the same information as you do. there is no correct answer. even if you find an edge, it won work all the time. In respect to charts, crypto is the most untrustworthy and hard to read. so just DCA or hodl your position for a long time.

every market is speculation. homes. stocks. bonds. there is never a guarantee, just "safer" guarantees..
@_date: 2019-07-03 18:35:22
lets break this down. they're sending you a wallet to use (what they dont tell you is that they have the seed passphrase to unlock your wallet). if you have a miner, and you connect it to their wallet, anything you mine will be taken from you instantly because they'll be watching your funds. wallets done use standard website type passwords since the seed phrasing is exactly the same and wont change unless you get a different wallet. and to add to this, they want you to fund the wallet first before "allowing" you to mine. so you're basically giving them free btc.

should verify if its legit first. then go from there. lots of scammers around. might make you pay them instead of the actual IRS. and you shouldn't be getting targeted by the IRS unless it was a big amount.. like 10-20k in profits/exchanges.

Some stocks will pay dividends. But it wont be much unless you invest a lot. And unlike BTC, you have to buy and sell an entire stock. Amazon atm is roughly 2k per. Meanwhile,i can buy penny amounts of satoshi. Homes work in the same way that BTC speculation does, however you need to mortgage a home and if the neighborhood goes bad, well.. but i do agree on the original statement of putting too much $ into a single investment is too risky. Need to spread the rism around multiple things

i believe that strong means it is "deflating" less then the others? lol. not entirely sure tbh. or the value of the euro is more then the USD. like 1 EU is equal to 1.12 USD. so technically, you can buy more with 1 eu then with 1 usd; i believe thats what may make it stronger

did you try turning it off and on again?
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:40:25
as of right now, sure. but tomorrow we might get a stagnating upwards price. who wants to hodl for a 1% gain a year? but this is like 20 years from now or more when price stabalizes. it'll happen, but most people for now are accumulating. spend and rebuy, hodl as well for future purchases or use "hodl" in a cold storage instead of a savings account.
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:46:40
I know you dont see the downwards triangle and the pending price action waiting to happen right after it crosses. Not to mention any rsi or any volume indicators. Which is why trends only go so far. Theres also the fact that fundamentals effect btc alot. News cycles, country bans, all effect price in which TA doesnt account for. Trendlines are a small part of a big picture. I dont day trade crypto due to its volatility. Idk if you can do vwqp on crypti charts but thats been better indicator for me larely. But it only interprets daily price action
@_date: 2019-07-25 18:58:10
dont use the btc you have now though. buy some extra with fiat and use that. so you dont get rid of w/e position you currently hold
@_date: 2019-07-24 15:47:52
alot more places will offer BTC. but price will be higher so you'll be getting less then, then what you would at the current price.

starting= $5k. sell it for a total of 10k, or 5k in profits. put entire 10k back into btc at 20k, then sell at 3000 for 1500. ending= 3.5k loss. you would only owe if the initial 5k profit was made in a different year. but then if you say gained, then lost a different year, you can write up to 3k in net losses and carry the rest over to the next year. so it really depends on what year you made the gains/losses
@_date: 2019-07-24 13:58:44
dont look at price. look at its rate of return on a yearly/semi yearly rate. $100 with a return of 1000% is better then $100 with a return of 8%. so it really depends on how long you're looking to hold and what you see in the future of what you're buying/investing in. you shouldn't stop because it hits a certain price point. and we will see times that price falls, but look at the overall returns. price halvening in 2016 was at about 600. it hasn't gone sub 3k since then. we have another halvening  in 300 days and price may go higher then what you're cutting your buying off at and it may skyrocket again like it did during 2017. and then you'll be back buying until it reaches 150k then you'll stop and repeat. DCA until you dont need to convert fiat anymore
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:11:05

the 2008 collapse, from what i've seen, was due to the fact that banks were profiting from multiple sources. first, they were accepting any and all "home loans" regardless of credit checks. this led to higher profits in their stocks because they were "doing so damn well". and the housing bonds were also going up because they were being filled with bs home loans and such. but it all pretty much blew up in their face; but the big banks pretty much understood they were okay and most likely planned the bailout to happen. it was the banks that caused 08, and if we all started to use btc, we wouldn't need banks. (other factors do come into play but thats my jist of it). 
- people do need to pay for stuff. and cash/fiat is only king at this moment since mass adoption hasn't started yet. we'd use anything for collateral for things we need in dire times. at the moment its cash. tomorrow might be bitcoin. in places of massive hyper inflation their using btc or bartering goods/trade jobs for other goods/jobs like we used to prior to a cash system.
when the recession hits, i think everything will take a hit; even btc. but we'll probably still see it inflate in price compared to everything else

@_date: 2019-03-28 16:49:55
Alot of the over seas exchanges can be shady. 
Coinbase is usually the go to for new buyers since its interface is very clean and easy to use. However, theyve basically become untrustworthy after the bitcoin cash drop.
I'd recommend Gemini. Easy to use and also are the first exchange to have gotten insurance in case of a shutdown or loss of coins. I wouldn't recommend leaving too much $ in any exchange, but a couple hundred is okay. The bulk of your $ should be in a hardware wallet.

TA is to open markets as a weatherman is to weather. there is a lot of probability and changes to your original prediction as more and more information comes in. its never 100% or precise, but generally, its around a rough area of correct. can call a bottom of x and as more information comes in, slowly change. sometimes people can be $100-200 off; sometimes perfectly called. this is what TA does, it isn't an exact science, its constant input of new information along with past information to predict movements in the future as well as managing risk in case your extremely wrong.

we will see a huge push for crypto like currencies like Libra. alot of banks will try and establish their own as well. but that doesn't remove the banking system and it'll tumble just as fiat is tumbling as well. btc will continue as is, uninterrupted. we'll see more FUD involving said bank/govt backed cryptos but the greed and the lies will remain. the mass population might be more comfortable with cyrpto and slowly adopt to btc due to banks lying and such

Its 50/50 where price goes. TA and fundamentals can help determine where price may be headed. Its never 100%, but a 60-80% educated guess is better then 50%. Skilled traders use this to their advantage. They also have different plans that vary depending on what happens after entering a position. Increase size, exit trade, etc. TA isnt exact and it isnt law. It changes minute to minute, day to day, etc. Its all constant information that one watches and interprets. Thats why trading is so lucrative. Its difficult to master but it isnt an exact science..like many on here post. A good trader knows when their wrong and when to hold. Managing risk, sizing, and profits/losses. Its fun, but nowhere near exact. And it does help with probability. Just draw a couple lines and youll see.. trendlines are the simplest form of TA imo. Sometimes fib levels work, sometimes not. Its all math.

time travel, atleast going back in time with the same materials, is mathematically possible. physically though, near impossible with the technology we have; since everything you're trying to make go back in time must be given the same and equal force that it was first given. also, science is never ending. today it may be that the law of nature doens't allow for the same matter, but tomorrow we may find a way.

but the price of the Yuan is at 11 year lows. so it is important. so what you stated above makes no sense since you're saying money (Yuan) is important. chinese fiat trending at 11 year lows is pretty bad. especially with trade wars going on. we all see what happens when a currency gets too weak and becomes useless. not saying its going to happen, but 11 year low ins't a good sign that its healthy. and it may transfer over to people buying btc instead.

According to a Cambridge University study, there are from 2.9 to 5.8 million active bitcoin users. The study was done in 2017 and gathered survey data from nearly 150 cryptocurrency companies and individuals, and it covers 38 countries from five world regions.  At least 1,876 people are working full- time in the cryptocurrency industry, and the actual total figure is likely well above two thousand when large mining organizations and other organizations that did not provide headcount figures are added. Hence, we can expect the number of active users to be even higher in 2019.
Source:  .
6million people from 38 countries is probably a single digit figure.. so we're still in the extra early era of adoption. in 2017/2018, it was estimated about 1 in 4 Americans knew about BTC.

yea. a barter system most def. but itd more so be for other food or meat, not gold. unless there was a sign that the internet may come back on, idk. but if the new ruler of the towns believed gold was valuable, then i guess. only reason gold was what it was is due to kings/queens liking the jewelry. now its value is based more so in its use in tech

No. im saying food/water/shelter/medicalaid &gt; all sources of money. there would be no need for money. and if the internet went down, who are you going to sell gold to? who would even be buying it? like the peopel who own farms would be rich. and people in citiies, without google or the internet, wouldn't even know where the nearest farms are or where to go to get food. so without proper knowledge, once the food runs out in the supermarkets, how do they resupply? how do they know where to go? the truck drivers, how do they know what stores. alot of it is all automated and integrated onto the internet and uses data to keep in touch. so once thats gone, and if no one wrote anything on paper, it'll be extremely rough

hypothetically, the entire world would collapse for a couple of months. all trade between any and every country would collapse. all talks amongst countries would stop. we'd literally be in the dark ages and the farmers and crop growers would hold all the power since food and water would be the only necessity. towns would be overrun by looters; and such everyone would become a looter because who tf cares about money at that point. it would literally be fucking crazy. and btc would not exist..until we get a computer to run the code again and maybe we find/link before we went offline or we start a new chain. but a good 20% of the population would die due to shortages and small internal fighting between cities and people over resources.

btc is based on w/e you want to base it on. doing it in fiat is easiest. it can be worth 1 tree, or 7 dogs. but fiat is easier and more understandable. but 1btc=1btc. and exchanges dont set the price, the market does. the exchange only grants easy access to buyers/sellers. its a marketplace not a bank. if you dont move the majority of your cyrpto to private keys then you run the risk of losing it if the exchange goes down. i dont think it really helps with adoption and "winning"

@_date: 2019-08-16 18:20:22
i believe so. however, no one knows what future price will be, so its basically taking a guess and trying to get a good deal. like wanting to buy 1 BTC at 10k expecting it to hit 15k, but then if its at 9k at the end of the contract, you've basically lost 1k but the other person sold you that btc at 10k and made 1k.

im not moving anything. im telling you the root cause of the problem.  and yes, getting a raise or investing and making a certain percentage over inflation, you are 1: beating inflation and 2: making some extra income. this is the current mindset. but what do you do when hyper inflation hits? and when a recession/great depression hits? you got your cool 8% raise for next year but when your fiat is now devalued 20-50%, what then? its not goal posts, its root cause. its like taking medication for a headache while your cancer goes untreated

well do they? the ledger is public you know. you can see what wallets are active and inactive. and they dont keep the btc, they make money off of the fees..not hodling. and you have a fucking wallet provided and its shown on the PUBLIC LEDGER THAT ITS IN THAT WALLET, so they can't give out fake bitcoin. you'd need more then a massive supply of BTC to pull that off, not trading it back/forth. market sets itself. you're extremely paranoid and should speak with someone about that since everything is literally public.. why does anyone need to DCA at all. i can buy in bulk or none at all. or i can buy today, spend tomorrow. dont tell people what to do.
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:22:28
if you invest in stocks, then you understand that that too is purely a vessel for speculation. a company your investing in, in your hopes, puts out product or labor that in turn makes the company more valuable thus raising its stock price, and then making you richer. if a company starts to slip up and goes bankrupt, you're shares of that company can go to 0. where as with BTC, it doesn't produce or put out anything because it is the thing. it will always have value and its price is determined by demand and supply. supply is cut a 21mil and demand is growing due to uncertainty of governments to properly regulate fiat and also the immense bubble in government debts due to said fiat. if you believe in the tech, you dont have to worry. if you think its all bull, thats cool, but go read up on the tech and the advancement of it and where it could lead.

even if you, peronsally, have never spent a dime on fees at your bank and have never had to pay any interest on anything, your government is paying interest on money that was printed on thin air through a central bank with a debt tied to it. it will always have a debt tied to it and your country will need to print more so it can pay those debts, but it snowballs and at any point, if not careful, can turn into a avalanche of economic catastrophy. this is why we pay alot of peopel to balance interest rates and money supply. it isn't a direct at your bank fee that you pay, but all fiat has a debt and how do you pay back $1.05 when you only get $1 for every $1.05 you owe? its an endless cycle that was created to calm the economic storm a long time ago. and its close to failure once again, which is why we btc.

imo, its due to wage stagnation and inflation. most salaries never increase unless you move to a different job, and every year the buying power of USD goes down; im in the US. its sad that the working class has to "escape the rat race" since all companies and institutions need the working class to function. imagine if all the base line workers at amazon, or USPS, or mcdonalds just vanished.. the entire company would collapse. working class used to be empowered with a good minimum wage and worker unions. but now, its all pretty much gone and costs go up but wages dont. can definately cut some costs, but at the point of a mental breakdown cause eating out once a month or not doing anything but sleep on weekends is a weird dystopia to live in

oranges to apples. stocks aren't currencies. bitcoin isnt a stock or an investment. btc is a currency that is limited and impossible to reproduce. because of this, its price inflates unlike regular fiat which is deflationary. people invest more so to leverage against this deflation. ppl will continue to invest. and its a good thing to invest in companies that are doing good or that you believe in, because you want them to be more successful.

no. unless they took your money from your bank and gave you back nothing, then no. but even then, depending on where you live, there may be a time frame on when you can bring the case to court. but it seems that they just blocked your buy and you didn't attempt to buy again, so basically, take the L and start again now

taxed when you sell/trade it. so if you use some of it to buy a coffee its a taxable event since you traded it. or if you sell for fiat. if you just hodl you wont get taxed. you minimize the tax rate if you hodl for 1year or more. anything less and its hella taxed. this is US, not sure where you are

AND IF IT DOES REACH 100k by Dec 2020, you are guarenteed to buy BTC at the 100k strike price, so if its 101k, congrats your buying btc at 1000 under market price. you'll make more money buying bitcoin directly then a shit call option lol

market sets itself. exchanges do nothing regarding to price. they make it easier for a seller to find a buyer and a buyer to find a seller and adds in a 3rd party fee so none of the buyers/sellers get scammed. obviously, 3rd parties can sometimes now be trusted as well.. but price sets itself.

should definitely read up some more since you skipped almost everything in your life. Currency - a system of money in general use in a particular country. Cash - money in coins or notes, as distinct from checks, money orders, or credit. So currency is a system of money and cash is the physical representation of that currency. Money - a current medium of exchange in the form of coins and banknotes. you're literal debate is the difference between the pronunciation of tomato, since currency/money/cash is all synonymous to each other. money is currency/cash, and currency/cash is money. BTC is money/cash/currency that is recorded via a public and distributed ledger that tracks all movements of all btc in the system. because of its scarcity and inability to produce more then the 21m btc, its buying power goes up instead of down, like our traditional fiat since more btc can't be printed. its purchasing power goes up which is why alot of people use it as a store of wealth. but it can also be spent in satoshis, which allows it be currency/money/cash/etc. please go educate yourself before trying to teach others.

bitcoin didn't have exchanges till years after. and alot of start up exchanges were p2p in person, not OTC online like how they are done today. its ease of use but isn't necessary. and you can stop facebook and other companies because you can directly attack the entity. btc is anonymous and a single rig can keep it going. you cant ban it unless you ban the internet; and if you're tech savy you can still find a means of access. and IRS is only able to track btc due to KYC laws. so if youve never bought on a KYC exchange, its extremely difficult to track someone down; esp if someone uses multiple wallets and other crypto
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:58:18

UI is pretty bad still, but its doable enough in the mean time. yea, im waiting for the global adoption so i can spend, but hodl in the mean time. i think alot of ppl new to the space tend to forget what its actual use is for; since weve seen rising demand but the tech isn't able to scale at that pace

i think most ppl who hodl, me included, are waiting for when BTC is atleast as widely as accepted as paypal. hodl till you can buy btc using it. so not much so converting it back to fiat and buying using that, but using btc as a currency to buy stuff with; and you'll be able to buy more tomorrow then you do today

HOWEVER, we're getting fucking taxed to death and getting jammed with loan after loan while the people giving out loans aren't paying taxes; ie big pharma and tuition. so that is a form of theft to me (US). so we definitely need to fight for bigger tax breaks for the middle/lower class, higher taxes for corporations and less loopholes, and reorganizing the cost of public college/healthcare. but not paying taxes isn't the right way to go along

@_date: 2019-06-20 17:16:56
you're right that the price for the halvening is already priced in. but you're wrong in that when supply is halved (price doesn't change because of this), and demand stays the same or goes up, price then is carried up due to this. so: btc creation halves, demand goes up since theres less btc created as before, price goes up, fomo, less supply because more people hodling, more demand because of fomo and new pro-coiners, price spikes until demand lessens and theres more people selling then buying/using

its both. technicals help predict future price points and possible resistance levels.fundamentals like LN/btc updates and "crypto bans in xyz countries" can drive price in a set direction. have to use both to determine a good buy/sell price. you can trade using both, one or the other. nothing can predict future price accurately because no one knows the future

a long way is probably 10-15 years away.. or less. btc isn't going anywhere but up. but good UI is miles away, and even further is everyones overall understanding of how to be their own personal bank. atm, btc can't scale all transactions that a govt fiat can; BUT not saying we're not already on track and other stuff being developed for it to do so. adoption will probably come when UI is easier for an average joe. after that, scaling for all transactions would need to be set in place. once that happens, we might see a shift in public sentiment towards btc over fiat

i agree, the crypto market isn't rational, since its a baby. and most global markets are pretty rational and can be forecasted like the weather.

because there isn't 30 websites dedicated to each halvening and the exact block and potential date of said halvening and having about 85% of total supply already mined in circulation. big shock. not saying its going to keep price constant, but it isn't a shock, price is probably already being priced into the market as a whole and we'll see an upwards trend. but whats currently not factored is demand and fomo

it was. then price rose because adoption grew and demand with it. now, price is too high for most to use it at a smaller level so we're waiting on LN and other updates to get it up to par. notice how millions/billions are moving in single transactions; for basically pennies. with faster/cheaper transaction fees, it'll get back to cash for everyone. but right now, its mainly for whales to move without banking fees/international fees. hodl till then

price is rising because its working as intended and purchasing power is going up. it isn't because of any outside factor. plus theres the halvening and price may be factoring that in now since long time hodlers and others are rebuying.  we wont see another round of fomo for a while; but most likely after we break current ATH and a couple future ATH. if you start seeing BTC segments during daily televised shows like fox or something, be ready for the fomo.

the USD has lost roughly 2% a year since its creation. the only thing that happened with the gold standard is that it was "backed" by gold. now its "backed" by government promise. and yes, wage hasn't kept up with depreciation of the USD and prices are still rising even to keep with inflation. which is why its gotten too expensive to live in alot of areas in the US. stagnant wages, depreciating buying power, increase in prices all around for everything. the "raising minimum wage raises everything else" is a fallacy cause everything is already fucking raising but wages lol

the tech tracking and tech agencies doing that is more so that there's no govt legislation that stops them. so following you on the web is part of their business model since they can sell that information to other companies like marketers and such. iirc, state/fed agencies are barley looking into tech being able to do that

@_date: 2019-04-19 19:44:36
that wasn't objective at all. if he did, he'd know the intrinsic value is its ability to send money across the internet for low fees (when transactions aren't backed up). its also created using very little energy cost and unlike fiat, it isn't tied to a central bank or a central govt, and its cost inflationary and not deflationary. and the argument of "instrinsic value" goes to literally everything. Including gold, housing, stocks, etc. its only worth what someone else will pay; except those markets have hundreds of years beign built upon and trillions put into them that its a safer market; while btc is 10 years in an a couple bill put into it. who needs a third party and for what? LN will fix the scalability. it was literally created to do this after transactions were so backed up the fees were immensely high. segwit and LN both are growing/adopting and will fix that problem. and anyone can be a miner. and even 1 miner was left, the network still works and the creation of BTC would be immensely easy (created for such probability that some miners would enter/leave). 
the only thing he said that was correct is that the safety of ones coins is all up to the user lol.

not to mention alot of people who get paid good dividends just put the $ back into that company for more stock. basically rebuying stocks with that dividend and not selling until they actually need it or they pass it on to their family. and its actually extremely easy to buy/sell stocks and options, and forex. and fees are almost nill if you know a good broker/company. i pay 1.25 for every buy/sale lol. more $ to be made in the market as well compared to crypto. but the long hold/adoption is what im here for.

by the time its at 1mil, im assuming we're at full on adoption by major industries/corps/countries. and people will either be buying or just using it as a currency at that point. same can be said for all markets. as long as there is someone willing to buy at your price. which is why real estate is so high in cities vs smaller towns; people are still buying at extremely inflated prices. and gold is only going up..until we no longer want to use it as a store of value and sell it off to make things out of it instead.

to add onto this, when "money" is created, the main banks issue a debt onto the money. meaning, gocernments owe more then what is printed. insuring that the banks stay paid/have power. where as BTC, it doesnt have any debt tied onto it and it pays parts of that 1BTC to whoever mined it and also pays to those who keep transactions going.

itd be like you were looking to buy a business. and the business told you their making 1M in sales every year, and on the books they write that down too. but in actuality, they make 100k a year and forged the books to make themselves look more profitable. thats illegal. and a scam. and that is withholding information. now if you knew they were doing 100k, and believed you coudl turn it into a 1M company, then okay. but withholding that info is illegal/immoral. thats insider trading

its punishing companies from doing shady shit. its why its illegal in the market overall. imagine having a company declaring bankruptcy but the CEOs and share holders sell off the stock before announcement. making sure they profit while everyone else loses everything. or proping up a fake company, getting it traded on the market, then dissolving and selling off all the shares before people realize the company is another pets.com . insider trading is illegal for a reason. but in the crypto space, there isn't regulations against it. so yes, fuck CB and roger and anyone else who partook in that shit

its more so that when money is printed from the central banks, a debt is tied onto it. so if we print a billion, we (the govt) owes a billion and 1. but to get 1, we must print more, but then that 1 becomes 2 and so on, creating a spiral of forever debt and inflation (since more money printed is more money in the economy pool and the purchasing power goes way down). loans/debt aren't bad, but its when we can't pay back it is. and the ones printing the money know the system wont work forever, so we try and balance it as best as possible; until it collapses. its during this collapse that we'll see a huge switch into a new currency system.

no ones putting facts to the side. were arguing which of the 2 (Gold vs BTC) is a better store of value and a better currency. no one is saying anything against gold farming here. its just the storage/value were talking about. BTC is less impactful to the environment and easier to store and send. Gold is good for hardware and such, but we need to move off the gold standard and use it for computers and such, not store it in a vault

can you explain why it shouldnt be?
withholding pertinent information can dictate price. say if Google is going bankrupt but only a handful of shareholders are told about it. They sell at Google's current market price. Then after they take their profits, they announce the bankruptcy. Sending price spiraling. Then they short their own company. Everyone gets fukt except those handful of people. That's why insider trading is illegal. If everyone had known about the bankruptcy, then each individual is  on a level playing field and do what they please with the information given.

"a dollar produces a good which is then sold for more dollars" - fiat doesn't produce anything other then a means of payment for goods; which is good. cause how does one charge for non goods needed in society, like financial planning, medical research and such. 
"Now I understand the whole money is a medium of exchange, store of value, and a unit of account." fiat does no such thing except medium of exchange. it has 0 store of value which is why people invest in stocks or material goods to offset its 1-2% rate of decay due to inflation.
"However everyone mining bitcoin is not generating any goods to attain it." neither is using a printer to print money. and creating the Penny in USD is creation at a loss since it costs more to create a penny then its worth. it isn't about creating a good, BTC is the good lol.
"Your computer is burning through GPUs and high levels of energy to ‘mine’ bitcoins." energy consumption is actually very low. media bias and FUD make it seem like its alot but it isn't. and alot of good BTC farms offset cost of mining by the use of natural energy, like solar and wind.
"All the bitcoin ‘millionaires’ didn’t sell anything or do anything valuable to which someone would pay money for." the exact same can be said by people who bought into a company early and were given a percentage of a company, having done nothing else except pay into it. or people who find oil on their property and then sell to an oil company. someone's pay isn't equal nor should be looked at the work they actually put in.
"It’s like someone one day took dog shit and cat shit and mixed it together and said this is worth M O N E Y. So after several years, the dog and cat shit combo became popular, thanks to the internet. And wow! People suddenly started saying the dog and cat shit combo is now worth 20K." well yes, but no. if someone is willing to pay 20k for that, then by all means. theres paintings out there worth hundreds of millions or are priceless, but that doesn't mean everyone is going to pay that amount. like the jesus that appeared on the grilled cheese that sold on ebay for a couple thousand. but btc isnt that.
"This isn’t the same as gold because gold was the original universal currency. Everyone considered gold valuable since the discovery of it." this is literally what the cat/dog poop analogy you used is. gold is literally, in a sense, useless. great for computers and such, but it is literally useless as currency. the only reason it was is because someone in the higher class said it was so because of its looks and the jewelry they could make and considered it valuable. we can do the same thing to any mineral or rock found on earth. gold should be used a conductor not a means of value. the diamond is also useless. but the majority of all diamonds are kept in storage by huge conglomerates and they keep the price of the diamond high. if all those diamonds flooded the market, itd be almost useless except for medical supplies and diamond edge tools.

futures trading. 2 parties agree on selling/buying at a set price in the future. so we can agree that you sell me btc at 8k on Oct 15th. when the day comes, i buy at 8k no matter the market price. so you could get btc for extremely cheap or expensive depending on price. future trading is done with oil/crops/etc. and now btc.

btc is just 10 years old. the internet was born in 1983. then in 1990 they created the world wide web, using the basic internet, which we use today. we're not even close to mainstream adoption and we've already had segwit and LN. if you're not accumulating now, then dont whine about it when btc reaches several mill in another 10 years
@_date: 2019-09-11 13:46:36
everyone is making fun of you, but lets educate you instead.  "Money" is created out of thin air. we only use a paper currency because its alot easier to tie a value to something using currency rather then a barter system. before, the USD ( im in the US ) was backed by gold, now its backed by nothing. the fed govt is balancing printing as well as interest rates so that hyper inflation doesn't occur, inflation is going to happen regardless. now with BTC, it is being created out of thin air, but it doesn't need anything to "back it" because it is both the currency and the asset thats backing it. only a 21Mil supply, so its value goes up since its scarce and you cannot print anymore, unless you make an altcoin; but no one wants off brand cheap shit. so demand goes up with adoption, but supply stays stagnant; price then goes up. its trust comes from computers and no person/corporation doing any middle manning. its person 2 person. it cannot be copied/double printed (USD has alot of problems with people making fakes bills). it can also be transferred between countries without care because its done via internet, not ship transportation or a bank. there is no energy shortage, there is only refraining from natural resources; which alot of govt are being lobbied to do. wind/solar/etc, its an easy fix but your local politicans are being paid not to do so by big coal and oil fucks. the inflation bubble isn't in BTC, its in debt. which governments owe to the central banks. BTC is a big fuck you to the middle man, the banker. cut him out, then you have a currency that is created by energy and not printed out of air that has a debt tied to it. print with energy, expand the mining pool to everyday folks, switch to renewable resources, fuck the banks. this is btc.

there is no perfect currency, btc is as good as it gets in the mean time. mining is required so that the math gets done and btc and the blockchain keep moving ahead. the energy required to mine is easily offset with renewable resources. when btc has reached its 21M, miners will be paid by the fees required to transfer and add on to the new block; where right now its being paid in the new creation of btc. but by that time, in 100years or so, we should have mroe advanced compturs where mining wouldn't be controlled by any one group, but rather a small mining rig implanted everywhere so there is always fast transactions at a small fraction of the price. satoshi wrote the code after the crash caused by banks and the bailouts. its to kick out bankers and place the pwer of currency in the hands of the people, instead of central banks.

its not that its wrong, its that its the wrong economy. a HS diploma got you a union job with benefits and only 1 parent needed to work. if you wanted to be rich you needed a bachelors. now, you need a bachelors to just compete but the price of school is so high you basically drown in debt and unless you pay a very well paying job (not likely) you'll pay it off in 10-15 years and you wont mortage or be able to do much since you're credit would likely be fucked on how much you borrowed. community college to 1-2yrs of undergrad is the real life saver

whole article is wrong in many ways. forks dont do anything. and the only ones to gain traction are the ones that are "publicized" by roger or faketoshi guy; no one wants china-knock of btc. its price fell because we're still very early in adoption that any news can effect price. but if you look at year lows, we've been on a constant uptrend. and "encouraging spending" isnt the best/ideal way to think of things. it makes people spend money on things they dont need. tbh, the only reason people spend is because their buying power will lower tomorrow. with btc, buying power increases tomorrow (in 20-30yrs when its stable) so you dont need to spend on things that are unnecessary. different type of currency and different type of mind set; what it will do, no one knows since we've been on "spend now, think later" system for a good century. if your buying power grows by itself, the economy will be sustained without anyone needing to buy or circulate money; because your money grows by itself. once stable enough, it'll be a good 1-2% increase like how we experience a 1-2% decrease with our current fiat system. have to think differently and how it'll effect things. volatility is bad in currency, but btc is still an infant so its to be expected. look longterm, not today. the debt is caused by borrowing money from CENTRAL banks that add a debt to be repaid for money printed. thus created a never ending system of borrowing because you must create money to pay off that debt but then that added fiat to pay the debt gets a debt so its endless cycle of borrowing. with btc, because it gains value, would decrease and potentially, pay off the debt because its buying power increases, not decreases like fiat. and "Maybe if the entire world switched to BTC, the value of global debt would decline as it is mostly in USD" this statement shows you dont understand the global markets since the printing power of the banks can be paid in any currency but they take the one that they print mostly. just needs to be exchanged. iirc, the euro is stronger then the dollar, usd shouldnt be the go to in your comparisons. bailouts might still work the same, but we wouldnt need banks (atleast not how they are set up today.) the fees are a nuisance right now, but in the future, we might see a reduction or a change in the system of mining where its barely anything. again, idk how that'll go down but its not perfected yet. you're ending paragraph proves you're a fucking dumbass lol. "BTC is good for online purchases, especially illegal ones, offline illegal purchases as well." fucking jackass lol

10k is a good psyche level for people. i dont think it will trigger a fomo run, but it would definately get people re-interested in BTC. fomo would probably happen if we reached a new ATH and held above 20k

"would it matter to you whether people were paying with bitcoin in stores or not" . ughmm Yes. Thats the whole fucking point of this thing lol. what really matter is stores with recognition names. not bitcoinadopters.com or hodlrmerch.org . but AT&amp;T, to use crypto? thats a big step foward.

dont debate anyone that says X is the best. there is no best. all investments you can gain or lose. it depends on how well you manage that investment. a house you have to pay taxes, pay the mortgage, pay for repairs/etc. if you buy a stock, you better keep up to date with what the company is doing because the price may stagnate for a couple years or go down. no point in an investment for 5 years to see it gain 1%. same thing with BTC. except BTC is early. like buying into Apple when it was a couple guys in a garage or buying website URLs when the internet was just beginning. if someone says X is ALWAYS or THE BEST investment, they really dont know what their talking about since diversifying in the most markets as possible is the strategy to use, and adding btc o it is okay.

in 2017, they said up to 5k. then it reached 5k and they said up to 7k by december. can't really call any price really.. but if we can break 6k, then im sure we can reach 7.5 and beyond
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:10:05
no. you're not. but if you bought/sold using an exchange and your name is connected to the btc you sold; since btc is treated as a asset, just report it on your taxes to be safe. tbh, fuck the system, but just report it regardless on your taxes next year lol. if in the US.
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:58:50
he has no idea what he's talking about. if he did, he'd chart it. fibonocci levels are useful, but he has no end point to refer it to; meaning, you need a low and a high to stick the fib levels to get the .382 he's talking about. but we dont know the highest point of the rally. you can follow its retrace using fib levels, but you can't pinpoint when the top will top off using it; in most cases. and from what i can see, its not exactly useful atm since we've just broken out of a bear cycle

because no ones using it. the fact that it will be there and a sign that adoption is growing is good either way. even if they dont take the btc directly and just get it switched to fiat immediately, it has to start someplace, it has to start somehwere. we'll never get pure BTC transactions if we dont start atleast some process where integration and innovation will slowly start.

january of 2017, price was around 980-1000. its peak that year for the bullrun was around 19000. thats roughly 18-19x. you're likely extremely bearish in terms relative to btc price. in 2017, 5k was the ATH we were dreaming of, until it broke and we thought maybe 7-10.. it hit almost 20. that fomo is no joke. wouldn't doubt seeing mcafees price become reality sooner then he says tbh.

yea, fees always going to go up when theres a bunch of new money coming in and everyone is looking to buy. new tech isn't polished and finished overnight or a few years. look at how slowly the internet expanded. or how slowly the computer progressed into fitting in our pockets. takes time. takes innovation. takes a bunch of bullshit to happen and someone to come foward with a fix. could be LN, could be segwit added to all exchanges/wallets, could be something new. only time will tell. till then, just gotta deal with the fees

where do they sell it? how do they sell it? i dont know metal selling nor do i trade it. i dont know if its real or not. i dont know anything about this "bar" or how pure it is. it isn't that people wouldn't take the higher thing to sell, its they just dont know. and selling something that was just given to you isn't the first thing people think of; its more so in hindsight. and there is literally a market for everything you can possibly buy/see, not everyone knows and that's okay.

or maybe its being devalued by USDT and once that goes to shit we'll moon? no need to really worry about Tether tbh. we saw the same thing in 2017 and they said we're falling to 0 as well. only sucks for those who are holding Tether or are using the exchanges that use USDT as well.
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:10:09
btc reaches 100k+ by end of 2020/2021. no one can stfu about price hike. then fees are in the $100 range, then it falls 70% and settles around 30-50k. then we repeat this process again until someone figures out a way to keep fees down while price spikes up. doesn't matter if people hate it or love it, they'll come back and someday, we wont repeat this process

feel like it is kind of like an investment. in our current system, we invest so that we can hedge against inflation. but if our currency was BTC and the price would rise 1-2% yearly instead of decrease, feel like thered be more people just leaving their money liquid vs actually investing.
