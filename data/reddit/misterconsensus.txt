Yes and so now there is Ethereum but bitcoin maximalist call those all shitcoins not realizing that currency is not the only application of a blockchain based system and that the other crypto are not necessarily a competitor. This IS the evolution of Satoshi's technology that you are talking about. 
Ironically Bitcoin Cash is more orthodox than Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash has no segwit and has raized the blocksize limit just like was the original idea.
I think less then one decade is a little early to claim you have better ideas then Satoshi. Let's follow HIS idea and vision for a while. How about that?

I recently asked a homeless guy if he accepted Bitcoin and he looked at me with pity and gave me 10 bucks.

TCP/IP had to update from Ipv4 to Ipv6 and did so ontime, so the internet never stagnated. But bitcoin should have updated to 2 MB and the problems we had in 2017 would never have happened. LN is like ipv6 but the migration from Bitcoin in 2017 to LN was a bad experience for most users. I hope those users will give Bitcoin a second chance ... but the market can be very hard and punish weakness.

As long as we never forget that Bitmain is evil and tell every new person on this sub at least three times that Bitmain is evil. When they ask us but why are they evil then we can say: Everybody always says they are evil so they MUST be evil, don't you think?
