No surprises here. a good percentage of the bitcoin community are scammers. They probably see this scam and say "hey why didn't I think of this, this guy is a geany" and down vote it out of sight for their fellow scammer.

Right now bitcoin is like the monopoly game where everyone is trying to take control of different properties so they can build houses and hotels. Soon the game will conclude and there will be one big winner.

Oh you mean if they bought coins 4 months ago to bet on the superbowl? yeah possible, but I'm guessing the majority bought recently (weeks or days) to bet  on the superbowl. You see most gamblers like betting and then cashing out their winnings. They don't take home casino chips even though they are probably more stable than a risky volatile commodity. Betting with bitcoin is not the same as betting with fiat. If the bitcoin books converted bitcoin to fiat then that might help. Because at the end of the day cold hard  cash is still more stable than bitcoin. 
oh and this pretty much sums up my point. "currency pairs aren't too relevant for most people's daily lives, or those that live entirely within a single country/currency and have no overseas obligations."

Circle or Coinbase might be faster. You don't have to deal with a slow blockchain. I think If your friends have accounts at those sites you can send directly to them without using a blockchain. They also have fiat wallets so you can easily convert bitcoins to fiat and hold fiat instead.
pretty neat stuff.

I predict bitcoin will become more centralized and less transparent  in the coming years. Centralization can provide a more stable environment for bitcoin to grow like other well known payment systems. When block rewards decrease and fees become more important and there is only one or two large mining operations running the show (most likely split into subsidiary companies so hashing power remains split and gives a decentralized feel) because they can still squeeze a profit out is when bitcoin will really take off and succeed.  The settlement layers will be necessary and bring in large investors. One day the settlement layers on top of bitcoin , payment processors, mining operations and large holders of bitcoin might even be one company.  They will be able to set policy and truly control the flow and supply of bitcoin and with it bring stability like other centralized entities have done before them.
 It will be a exciting time for everyone involved even the share holders (bitcoin users).

Easier to use fiat books in most countries. You don't have to worry about the amount you bet losing value. Especially true for larger bets.  Who wants to lose hundreds of dollars on a bet before the event even takes place because the value of bitcoin dropped 20 dollars or more.

Is it true all bitcoiners will have a window of opportunity to double their coins when the hard fork happens? 
Because that would be hilariously funny to watch go down.

I'm guessing most buy coin a few days before an event to make sure they have the money ready and some bettors place bets days or weeks before an event to get better odds. 
So let me check bitcoin charts. Hmm if they bought somewhere between feb 3rd - 6th which i assume most did since the superbowl was on the 7th and cashed out right now they would be down about 30 bucks per coin. If they bought anytime last month they would be way, way down.

I think that is how bitcoin is intended to be used. Why would someone want to get paid in oil or paypal shares? Local currency is much more stable for day to day things.

bitcoin will see a nice supply increase after these coins are distributed and put back into circulation.

How are you suppose to sell when the bubble pops if you don't have your coins on an exchange? It takes 30 minutes for 3 confirmations...

This makes me want to buy bitcoin so I can help increase your wealth.
