hey thanks for the smelly tip lol :p
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:55:02
This could be true in practice if we can stop throwing pennies on creative/informativ/funny posts. I think $1 minimum will encourage them

A C++ developer buying a gun or two?? You're like the nerd version of Tupac
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:28:03
This. I read the whole thing and honestly have no idea what i just read,and i think i speak for a large group of people who are not *geeks*. You need to make a video or something
@_date: 2014-06-10 08:26:36

@_date: 2014-11-07 11:37:24

Most uncreative troll ever. Give it up already,even at trolling,you still suck.
@_date: 2014-11-13 08:39:17

@_date: 2014-05-26 10:29:58
Bitcoin noob question: Do people really tip here like in or tipping here in is just a myth?
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:10:27
How about back chain and front chain?
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:36:14
I don't have the slightest idea,i came here to learn about bitcoins from people who claim it to be the future of currency,yet they tend to get hostile and sometimes egocentric and self righteous. Some are really kind though i'll give you that. But they better be nice to newbies if they want bitcoin to succeed. Funny how they seem to hate other crypocurrency as well,they seem to be happy with other coin's failure not knowing they both share the same ambitions. Again,just some of the people here,not all.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:50:38
Enjoy your coffee and have a lovely day ahead
@_date: 2014-11-13 10:06:28

@_date: 2014-11-13 09:14:13
I share the same curiousity with you...can someone answer this?
@_date: 2014-11-07 08:58:56
Sorry i think "win" is not the proper word here. I mean which tip service has been used the most these past few day? Anyone has a stats?
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:31:44
Yeah i think since dogecoin's value is so low thats why they just practically throw it at people lol anyway i know people tip here as well 
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:19:59
Not the cock im referring to but ok lol :P How's your ~~cock~~ cake day going by the way? I hope i can tip you some bits but i dont have any on my account,but have a good one. Cheers!

@_date: 2014-11-13 14:02:09

There's some geniunely nice people on this subreddit but the sad fact is to be accepted here you need to participate on the circle jerk. If you're from another subreddit or crypto and came here to learn bitcoins you most likely will be called a troll,or wont get treated nicely. If you give out opinion that they don't like to hear,again you're a troll. This same people want bitcoin to be the future of currency but wont take nicely on newbies,and people who are having simple problems logging in to facebook,not everyone is a geek but everyone uses currency. If you want bitcoin to succeed *lead* and *teach*  *common* people about the system,rather than scare them away. Dont live up to the "circlejerk" stereotype of this subreddit and bitcoin itself. Bring the downvotes in,im ready.
