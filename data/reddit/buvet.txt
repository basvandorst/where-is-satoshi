I absolutely agree with you, the five years I've used BoA they have been great. What I'm saying is that it sucks that they are choosing to push out their smaller clients in what I view is a sleazy way of squeezing some money out of them before they go. I will be going to another bank because of this change.

Ok, I make a little over 30k a year, which is not great, but livable. I live in an expensive area and have had some emergency expenses come up, so I'm living paycheck to paycheck right now. For whatever reason, the company that I work for won't do direct deposit (I've asked). Bank of America is definitely the most convenient bank for me. I've been banking with them for the last five years. That said, it sucks that I'm going to have to cancel my account with them because I'm going through some hard times right now. 
One of the benefits of having a bank account, even if it's empty most of the time, is the ability to cash/deposit checks for free. It certainly does seem like I'm being punished for being in a worse financial situation than the clientele  they seem to want. I would much rather have Bank of America just say, "We're closing all accounts under this amount in 90 days, we want to serve a lower quantity but higher quality of account from here on out." But they're just being skeezy about it.

You're not wrong, I was unemployed for a month and a half recently and just got slapped with a surprise root canal haha. The rainy day fund is a little dry unfortunately

Because when you marry someone you love and respect you don't make major financial decisions without consulting them and taking their thoughts into consideration?
