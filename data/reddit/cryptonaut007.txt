I just watched meltdown and it is so depressing to see that powerful/rich people can just do what they want to do, because they won‘t end up in jail anyway.
That makes me sad.

I agree with you and I hope you are right. I, for example, love to travel, explore new places and organise my trips. So on the one hand I would love to work in a travel agency. On the other hand I am studying business and it is highly likely that I will earn at least double of the amount I would earn as a travel agent...
So I want to grow my wealth to be able to work as what I am dedicated to, I do not want to be lazy, that would be sooo boring.

You do not need a german based exchange. 
I started with Kraken because there it is possible to use Euro and in general I prefer exchanges over marketplaces.

The blockchain is a (decentralised) data base in a (distributed) network, that contains a continuously expanding log of transactions and their chronological order, which stands out which stands out due to the manipulation security in  form of solving the double-spending problem and the problem of the Byzantine generals.
