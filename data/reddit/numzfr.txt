From a pure benefit, getting more buyers in the game will help adoption and raise the market cap and then the price of BTC. But most people speaks about it just because they love it.

Anything works really, the easiest way to go is to use a website like coinbase, but they take a higher fee than most exchanges. Personnaly, I don't support coinbase anymore as there will be a fork and it seems like they support the "wrong" side of it.
You can also buy on exchange withtout bidding and asking, but using the market price, that's exactly what coinbase does.
Anyway, the bitcoin is a bit technical, and you'd better spend some time to understand how it works and how to secure your wallet before you decide to invest a decent amount of fiat money in it.

If you own your private key during the fork, you can get both coin, then sell 2x to anyone willing to buy it for you. 
Make sure to follow a tutorial from here to do so when the fork happens as there will be a scam fest.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:55:28

@_date: 2017-10-20 16:47:57
my point is simply that more and more people will jump in, driving the price way above what it is today, and that will work in an exponential way. 
You think about buying your first BTC now, and probably will, then more people like you will do the same.
Next year, big investement funds will jump in, and it will make the price blow to 5 digits if it didn't happen this year.
Right now, the price is surging because of the fork in 3 days, any BTC you own today will grant you same amount of BTG (the new coin from the fork), so I think it is the reason more people are rushing in right now.
Maybe, maybe, it ill dip after the fork, but TBH, you'd better start buying now because you never know if next dip will go lower than current price.
"But i don't know tho", don't take my word as pro investement, I didn't own any btc a month ago.
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:32:30
That's "estimated", and if that was true, how could miners even make money by confirming transactions?

If you hold BTC before the fork, you get both coins, as long as your control your private key. Then you can choose to sell coins on one chain or hold on both.
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:08:17

Not any wallet, one that allow you to control your private key, the others one are basically IOU. Paper wallet is good if you only want to store, hardware is good if you plan to spend some as it makes it easy and safe.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:07:43
If you research so much, you know that alts will heal after the fork, don't sell now, just hold everything that you got, and come back in few months.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:36:00
btw it's not a 1mb increase, it's up to 8mb with S2X, segwit can already goes up to 2mb even if that was never needed.

@_date: 2017-10-12 12:45:31
You can also move it to a wallet that don't support S2X if you believe the Core chain will be the one to survive, I used holytransactionas a web wallet before I got hardware wallet, it was really easy to use. Look at Electrum as well, it's a light wallet that let you control your private key on your computer, make sure to secure it, encrypt your wallet etc.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:05:01
you understand the cause, next search a bit about the effects please.
@_date: 2017-10-21 10:25:25
If you're buying using EUR, you do a SEPA on Kraken, then buy 1/2 right now, 1/2 at next low (max a week or right after BTG fork), then you move everything on a paper or hardware wallet (depending if you want to use some of your BTC soon - maybe to buy some alts), then come back in few months, years, and profit.
If you're buying USD, probably similar with another exchange. Just imho don't use coinbase or other 2-4% fee seller. Exchanges usually have fee around 0,2%.
(Paper and hardware wallets let you control your private key, which means control your bitcoin).

@_date: 2017-10-03 10:39:01
More money from whales, they are in for short term profit and probably undermine bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:41:27
I'm not here for short term, I'm young and can work to make money for short term, I'm here to fund and hold solid assets for the future.

The 4000€ wall did impact the BTC-USD around $4750, 'muricans wouldn't understand why there was resistance at a non-round number.
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:54:59
some people invested $100 few years ago and they have thousands, if not millions today. If bitcoin is 100k in 1-3 years, you'd have 2k$, probably more if you invested another $100 now and then.

There is no good way to vote on electronic when the vote is hidden, it needs to be recorded and public, but then it can be anonymized and only the voter has a private key to know which transaction is his, and make sure the vote went to the right counter.
There would still be a way to buy vote if voter can prove where his vote went, but at least the voting system can't be cheated, making it trustless and transparent, as one would expect from blockchain.

No it's not, S2X have blocks up to 8MB.

There is no guarantee the next dip will go lower than today's price. Don't invest all you have, invest what you can afford to loose - or to get locked for years.

there is no middle man, the transaction fee is to cover the cost of the blockchain, in theory anyone can confirm transactions and claim it the fee.
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:11:34
Yeah, they dropped the S2X and are now focusing on BCash, but the goal to take over Bitcoin hasn't changed.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:40:16
No it's not, I believe it will be $20k sometime next year.

That might take 1-3 hours during prime time, took me an hour yesterday evening for a transaction with max fee.

Fun thing, I live right in the middle of a first world country, but capitalism decided installing internet wasn't profitable enough, so I can only use 3G/LTE - which doesn't work in peak time about 4 months a year.
Also, in your price evaluation, remember than the blokchain is 150GB now, so you need 3 Bluerays, oh and who owns a Bluerays readers these days? Not me, even my DVD reader is unplugged for years, because I never use it.
Maybe we should be looking at light nodes that only need let's say the last 50-100 blocks and not entire Tx history?
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:39:00




I never said above 2MB, I said it can go UP TO 2MB BUT IT WAS NEVER NEEDED SO FAR.
As for evidence, go read the docs on Segwit you brainwashed fool.
The 8MB block is not needed, it's just an excuse to try to take control over Bitcoin, everybody understood it, everybody is going off it, it'll be left a Cashgrab like Bitcoin Gold.
When/if 8MB are needed, the consensus will go that way.

That's very weird, in French finance code, Bitcoin is considered as an asset, if you buy goods with it, you have to pay a tax on the profit made since what you paid as fiat to buy that bitcoin.
If you buy a bitcoin for 1k€, then buy a computer with that 1BTC worth 3k€, then you have to pay taxes on the 2k€ profit you made.

Just so you know, with Nicehash and that setup, it'll be a month to first payout, but it's nice for a first mining try. Else for easy of use there is a Vertcoin one click miner that should gives you equal if not better profit than Nicehash, and regular payouts. (check whattomine.com to see which coin is best for your hardware).
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:27:56
the benefit is adoption, as more and more people use it, and that lead the price up because the people that gets in needs to buy BTC, so they create more demand. Since the offer is limited, it raises the price.
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:39:43
not if a transaction fee is around 35k units.
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:59:31
That's all the irony of bitcoin now, you can't help but talk about Jamie or USD, while at the same time keep saying bitcoin will replace both of them.. oh wait did the Bitcoin reach a new ATH in USD ? I have to make a new post about the price in USD and brag how much Jamie is wrong!
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:42:54
The question is biased, and the way results are interpretated is biased too.
He's stacking S2X and Segwit+2MB blocks together to get majority behind S2X, when S2X is really up to 8MB blocks.
So YES to upgrade, but unknown to which upgrade. 1/3 S2X, 1/3 SW, 1/3 SW with 2MB blocks. That doesn't help at all. We could say that 2/3 vote against S2X according to this vote.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:41:54
Kraken is an exchange. 
It's easy, if you want to hold you move them to a wallet, for long term either hardware or paper, but it's strongly advised to use one which allow you to control your private key.
If you want to sell, you can do it from coinbase or kraken indeed.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:00:22
