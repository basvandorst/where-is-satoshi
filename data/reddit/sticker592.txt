The difference was caused by the available balance being calculated intermittently and the balance on the sell btc screen being calculated immediately. The other questions I still seek an answer for.

You can only connect one bank account as far as I can tell but it appears you can withdraw, change the bank and deposit immediately which other apps don't allow because of AML. The withdrawals come from the debit card and the deposits come from the routing and account number (ach). The Btc balance does not get used from debit card. You must sell it first. (I could not test it as I wasn't in the U.S. and the card only works in the U.S.)

I'm thinking about doing the exact same thing. How did it go?

Someone [reposted]( your reddit on [Yalls.org]( and made almost as much money as your node for people to see how much you made.

They loan your crypto to others for a higher interest. The KYC of them defeats my purpose for holding crypto, so even if they aren't a scam, I may just get my interest off of the safer starting bull market and forget about the interest on top of it.
