So my coinbase account sent me an email saying my identity has been verified but my account still shows as unverified. Is this normal or is it a bug?

The way I see it is you either have so little in that with fees you probably won't actualy save that much money or you have a lot in and it's a long term investment anyway.

You buy for 12. Sell at 10 and say okay I'll buy more at 8 then make my money back. Well then it starts going back up to 12 you just short changed yourself for no reason.

I think there is going to be another price jump when everyone gets their tax returns and decides to "double their money."
I'm hoping for a price dip when a lot of these people decide to sell to pay off christmas debts.

Um you can't use bitcoins to buy pizza anymore. You have to use fractions of a bitcoin to buy a pizza. Absolutely barbaric if you ask me.

I don't think he's panicking. Sounds like it just sucks to buy and then have it dip 5 minutes later.
It was at 16 for a few minutes this morning wish I would have put off buying. Not because I don't think its coming back up just because I would have gotten so much more by waiting a day.
