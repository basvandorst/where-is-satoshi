Can this technology finally enable completely autonomous smart contracts? Where the processing and even private keys (for funding, payouts, etc) are stored and processed in the cloud without any chance of alteration?
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:01:33
The first one that jumps out to me is the one I mentioned above... Autonomous smart contracts. 
You can write a contract and have it executed in the cloud, completely without human intervention. Payments can be received and sent per the rules of the contract, and no one can game the system or run off with the funds... They're in the possession of the contract itself. It holds the private keys and processes the funds in the network, and no one can see or alter the 'program' because of this technology. 
You could pay your mortgage to the smart contract, which would basically do what banks do now: act as middlemen between you and the lender. 
You could incorporate via a smart contract, with the contract handling who is on the board, who gets paid what, who owns what. 
Kickstarter could be completely automated.  Send your money to the contract, and if it hits the threshold, the project gets funded.  If not, the contract refunds everyone.
You could make a bet with your friends, and depending on the results, the smart contract pays the winner. 
All kinds of stuff that could replace the middlemen in the world... Escrow services, lawyers, bankers, etc.

Honestly it was a random idea in [another thread]( that suggested the idea of putting your QR code on your personalized card for convenience.  I liked the idea so I just jumped on my card's site to give it a shot myself.

If this one doesn't work, I'll try one with just the Bitcoin logo.  Just doing it all by trial and error.

@_date: 2014-04-27 17:18:14
That being somewhat true is also only somewhat true... ;) It's easier (and more profitable) to just charge everyone the 3% fee, so cash prices usually match the credit card price.  So we all pay the penalty, even if we don't use a credit card.
Hence folks wanting to use Bitcoin!  I think this is also why we see faster merchant adoption vs user adoption right now...  Merchants want to offer that 3% (or more) discount badly, to undercut the competition.
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:01:58
If everything really is 33% of the normal price, it would definitely be worth it to pay international shipping. An English version of the site would do you very well!

This is... Actually a really good idea!

Update: The QR code alone was denied.  Next I'll try just a Bitcoin logo.

ASICs are performing 99.999% of those calculations though... They can't do anything else. The other supercomputers can do any kind of useful calculations. 
That's like comparing tractors to F1 cars in terms of how many laps they can do around a track.

I didn't save it, but it was pretty much the same thing with a bitcoin logo in the center.
@_date: 2014-04-27 19:04:39
The number 1 retail giant isn't the best example though. To put it another way then, smaller companies would love to offer a 3% discount to get closer to being able to compete with giants like Walmart. 
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:11:31
Many times they are. Of course it's up to the merchant to offer the discount, but that's one of the reasons (mostly smaller) merchants are flocking to bitcoin faster than buyers are... They want anything that lets their prices compete with the bigger guys that can force their way into better pricing. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:10:14
You pay credit card fees every day...  Merchants are charged an extra, say 3% of a transaction every time they swipe your card, so they increase their prices by 3% to make up for it.  This is why many Bitcoin merchants offer 'discounts'...  Because they're no longer paying those fees when you use Bitcoin vs a credit card, so they don't charge it to you.
If you calculate an average of 3% of every credit card purchase you've ever made, you'll see that your 'rewards' don't come anywhere close to making up the difference.

They did cite copyright concerns, though I thought it was pretty darn abstract.

Along these lines, what about cash deposits at a bank branch, without meeting in person?  Safe?

They use the same credit-based checks that many loan and mortgage companies use.  If it's not working for you at Coinbase, it won't work elsewhere.  Best to check your credit at all three companies and correct everything.  Dispute anything that's incorrect or not yours.

Why not both? If we can code to have block size become dynamic like that, why not have max block size auto-scale depending on how full the previous blocks have been? Treat block size like difficulty, which autoscales based on demand. 
If blocks have been nearing capacity for a certain amount of time, raise the max block size. If they've been empty, lower it down. 
That way it scales with use, just like difficulty.
Let the market decide!

There's really no way to tell, but as someone who watched that climb down to the minute, personally I'd say the manipulation started way before $700. That could mean we're at the 'real' ATH now!

I bought at $120 but got greedy during the climb. I wanted a nice round $1200 before I sold, so I could say I made a 1000% profit. Peaked at $1167 before it crashed. :P

This.  A private blockchain is called a ledger... Banks already have those! I don't get the whole concept of a private blockchain (and something tells me banks don't either and just want to play copycat).
Are they running a blockchain on a network between multiple banks maybe, where all banks (and only banks) can participate? If it's just one company running it all, that defeats the entire purpose.

This is a very important point (and one that keeps me from rolling in grief that I didn't get involved earlier).  If we had all bought in at .004 cents, we would have spent it on things, and we would have slowly sold off along the way...  at $5, $10, $20, etc...  We wouldn't just sit on it while it was flying up in value by thousands of percents.
So while we would have benefited greatly, even if we got involved earlier most of us wouldn't be millionaires today.
At least that's what I keep telling myself.

Problem is you still haven't proven you're the owner of the wallet.  Different username.  If you can sign a message from the wallet stating that you're the owner, or post with the original username that this one is valid, then we're golden.  Otherwise we have to assume you're not the OP.

Can you sign a message from the address to prove that you're the same person as the original poster?
This is just an attempt to throw people off if you can't sign from the address or the original user doesn't say something about this user account.
Besides, if there's Unicode in the password, that's not 3 characters, that's technically 6.  It's two bytes per character.

Yes, paper wallets really are just for cold-storage.  Consider them one-time use.  After you use funds from a paper wallet, the rest of the wallet is sent to a change address that you control.  If you withdraw/spend from a paper wallet, you need to put the remaining balance into a new paper wallet.
After all... to spend it, you've had to enter the paper wallet's private key into an internet-facing computer.  That alone defeats the purpose of your paper wallet, since you want to create the private key on a machine that's never touched the internet.  Now that you've 'compromised' the original paper wallet, you want a new one anyway.

A 24/7 security detail (in *Russia*, for pete's sake) is pretty damn expensive...  Those Bitcoins are worth about 50k right now, that's probably just a few months of security, or a small percentage of his legal fees. His job probably covers his living expenses but not much else.

@_date: 2013-12-31 17:09:04
I mean something along the lines of 'If I use these inputs, here's a visual representation of the bytes required to send the total, and the associated fees for each piece'
Now that I talked (typed) it out, yeah this is something the wallet should be showing the user.  It would go a long way toward helping people realize that dust sites aren't always a good idea.

Keep in mind the majority of Bitcoin users are not investors...  They're young techies who have more than likely never traded on the stock market even once.  The gains over the last few months are too tempting... They could be putting their life savings into BTC, they might be putting money in that may have otherwise gone toward food.  The highs and lows have a much more profound effect on the average person than a seasoned (or even a novice) investor.
It's also why we see lots of people cashing out for Christmas...  These aren't investors cashing out, they're your average person who put $100 in and are now seeing $10,000.  A few hundred percent of gains is just too tempting for most folks, especially around this time of year.
I'm all for keeping it stickied; who knows, it might help someone.

Ok, I've got it running! I'm getting about 1 try per second per core, on an 8 core Xeon server.  8 instances running, divided evenly among the hex range.  Estimating the entire hex range to be tested in 23 days at this rate.
EDIT: Added a screenshot.  Tmux to the rescue!
EDIT 2: I've gotten anxious and just opened a CPU-intensive Amazon EC2 instance with another 8 cores, splitting the hex range that the first 8 are searching.  This one's moving even faster, maybe 1.5-2 tries a second per core:

If you look carefully, the username is different. Until either the original user says that the new user account is valid, or the new user account posts a signed message from the wallet stating that it's valid, we can't assume it isn't someone trying to throw us off the trail.

Electrum is a thin wallet client, it connects to an external relay server which has a copy of the blockchain, instead of you having to download the entire chain yourself.  That way you don't have to download the entire ~11GB chain.

Update:  If there's Unicode involved, this script isn't searching enough bytes but it's frankly not feasible to search twice as many bytes either. I've since shut down the EC2 instance since it's costing me $16 a day.  I'm still running things on 8 cores since I'm already paying for that server, though.  I think I'm going to limit the search to standard ASCII (20 - 126 instead of the script's current 0 - 256 search) in order to speed things up.  If nothing comes up from that, we can safely say that we're actually up against a 6-character password (since Unicode is two bytes per character).

Serious question...  If you're putting this USB drive into a safe for (potentially) years, what's the point of downloading the blockchain?

An an example, no one says 'MicroTorrent' or 'mu-Torrent' though, it's pronounced 'Yu-Torrent'.  u-bits would work from a pronunciation standpoint with me.
I don't like it from a functional standpoint though, nor do I really think the Satoshi valuation can work unless 1 Satoshi gets near the value of another mainstream currency's smallest denominator, say $0.01 USD (Wouldn't *that* be awesome for us early adopters).
I think we can all agree that there's an issue with mainstream adoption if we can't work out a simple to understand fractional naming convention though.

Change addresses are for anonymity purposes as well, though.  For example, in AureliusM's picture: 
5BTC was paid out, and the small change amount was returned to him.  But who's to say that he didn't make a small payment, and the 5BTC was the change? Or that he made two separate payments with no change? Change addresses help keep everything obfuscated.
