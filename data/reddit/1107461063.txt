Whats important is the block hash which needs to basically start with shit ton of zeros. Each nonce will do that only to that particular block

Because it's easy to claim science when you're actually doing pseudoscience. That word is just being thrown around like a thai hooker. 


I agree with you there. My point is people claim science while not adhering to the empirical scientific method. 


 if only you knew how bad things really are


Youtube is just a medium. like paper.  it's a means of communication. It's a way to exchange ideas. Nothing more. 


Sort of. First step would be to observe a natural phenomenon and then ask the question.  Good. So, what is the observed natural phenomenon when it comes to gravity?

@_date: 2019-07-24 16:33:35
That's like saying:
Im not well versed in economics but the Keynesian theory is generally accepted as the correct view of our economy and all of "our" models are based upon it. I'm sure if it didn't stand up to being peer reviewed and scrutiny from the whole economic community it wouldn't be accepted. What source disproves FIAT banking?
Listen.  E=MC2 isn’t even Einstein’s equation.  He was a literal cousin fucking patent clerk with no math background. His model doesn't even work out. To the point where you have to add 96% dark matter and dark energy. You might as well believe in the virgin birth. All bs. Scientific goboligook. Einstein was a fraud. Not only that, but he had not a single original thought
Curved space was thought of by Bernhard Riemann. Adding a 4th dimension that of time to geometry to create "space-time", by Hermann Minkowski. The idea that objects contract in proportion to the speed that which that they move, by George Francis, FitzGerald. The notion that the velocity of light in a vacuum was constant regardless of the motion of any object connected with the light ray by Hendrik Lorentz. Was he the first to bring up the impossibility of measuring light through the ether, after the Michelson Morly experiment null results? No! That was actually Henri Poincare. Did he even come up with the name relativity? NO! that was Poincare. How about no velocity can exceed the speed of light? Nope! Poincare! How about that whole clock business? you know, the "fact" that if you go at the speed of light, you age slower than if you stood on earth? NOPE That was actually Sir Joseph Larmor. Was he the one who came up with matter crinkles curved space? sorry to say no. That was actually William Kingdon Clifford. and that E=MC2 that you see people wear on their T shirt? J. J. Thomson came up with E = 3/4 MC2 and then later on our buddy Poincare came up with E=MC2 when he spoke to mass density in relation to energy density. He was if like Roger ver and Craig wright had a daemon child and he was born in the mid 1800s.

PUBLIC ADDRESS comes from the PUBLIC KEY  using cryptographic primitives.  Can't go the other way.
PUBLIC KEY, comes from  PRIVATE KEY using cryptographic primitives.  can't go the other way.
PRIVATE KEY is generated by essentially just flipping a coin 256 time then then adding some bits here an there, per standard.
If you flip a coin bunch of times, create a private key, and then from that get the public key, and from that generate a public address you can give that address to anyone and they can send money to it and you could be doing this in a cave with some paper. But all of this is done with the wallet software so you don't have to do any of this.
You can do in in python in  a few lines.
    import os, binascii, hashlib, base58, ecdsa
    def ripemd160(x):
        d = hashlib.new('ripemd160')
        d.update(x)
        return d
        
    for n in range(1):   # number of key pairs to generate`
    
        # generate private key , uncompressed WIF starts with "5"
        priv_key = os.urandom(32)
        fullkey = '80' + binascii.hexlify(priv_key).decode()
        sha256a = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(fullkey)).hexdigest()
        sha256b = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(sha256a)).hexdigest()
        WIF = base58.b58encode(binascii.unhexlify(fullkey+sha256b[:8]))
        
        # get public key , uncompressed address starts with "1"
        sk = ecdsa.SigningKey.from_string(priv_key, curve=ecdsa.SECP256k1)
        vk = sk.get_verifying_key()
        publ_key = '04' + binascii.hexlify(vk.to_string()).decode()
        hash160 = ripemd160(hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(publ_key)).digest()).digest()
        publ_addr_a = b"\x00" + hash160
        checksum = hashlib.sha256(hashlib.sha256(publ_addr_a).digest()).digest()[:4]
        publ_addr_b = base58.b58encode(publ_addr_a + checksum)
        i = n + 1
        print('Private Key    ', str(i) + ": " + WIF.decode())
        print("Bitcoin Address", str(i) + ": " + publ_addr_b.decode())
REMEMBER. THERE ARE NO COINS!!!
only keys and addresses. "coins" are numbers that are locked to your public address, and only your private key can unlock it and send it to another public address, which is spendable by the person who has the private key associated with that public address.

Correct. If you recall bunch of the words there are programs that try to brute force it. But will take a long time. Also, if you have the password set on your seed, then it will even be harder. You need the seed (words) and the password. You don't have to setup a password but it's a bad idea if you don't imo. The password is required if you wanna recover your seed on another device. The password is NOT local the the device. The 4 digit pin code is the only thing local to the device.

when bitcoin hits 100K they will claim a bubble. It will pop and it will be 50K and they will say bitcoin is now dead. at 50K they pat themselves on the back for not falling for the "ponzi" . Kek in its purest form! 
I've been in this space long enough to know that back then, in 2013 the idea of bitcoin being 1000 dollars was absolute lunacy. They would tell you that you are retarded to think bitcoin will ever go that high.  Now those same ass hats are claiming bitcoin is dead at 4K. i can't roll my eyes back enough.

wrong! I made sure I said the bitcoin blockchain is the most immutable database.  why? because it's backed by an ungodly amount of proof of work! thats what makes it immutable. if you wanna change a block from an hour ago, you would have to do THE WORK for like 6 blocks while fighting the rest of the network. NOT POSSIBLE.  your blockchain is just a database with some hashes! been around for decades.  it's not immutable.  do you understand? hopefully the SAT will drop for you sooner than later.

when miners create a candidate block, they give themselves 12.5 bitcoins to an address they created. This is part of the consensus rules. If you add more than 12, then it's not a valid block. all miners do this, but only the accepted block becomes part of the blockchain, so only that particular miner actually gets the 12.5 btc.  It is not usable however, until 100 blocks has passed in case of chain reorgs.  it's literally that simple.

This is the top of the pyramid. It's not aliens. Its not lizards. It's not Rothschild. Or Rockefellers. Those families  are the foot soldiers of the black nobility. 
Colonna, Massimo, Orsini, Ruspoli, Pallavicini, Theodoli, Sacchetti, Borghese, Odescalchi,  Boncompagni Savelli, Caetani,  Aldobrandini, Farnese, de madichi, etc. That's who run the show. Not the fucking Rothschild.
