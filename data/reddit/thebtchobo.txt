And how do I mine using middlecoin? Could my laptop do that? I have only a few valued possessions, and my laptop computer is one of them, so I would like to use that. Sometimes, I use computers at the internet cafes also, but I prefer my laptop, Windows does a good job of keeping my computer warm, which in turn keeps me warm.

I will be recording the show episodes when I receive donations. I am writing them now, and organizing the contents and trailers. It will be the world's first open source show for Reddit Bitcoiners and a Bitcoin Hobo featuring the purchases made with donations, and featuring the contributions of you. I will see it done. I am a person in need, of clothing, food and accommodation this Winter, and I am living in cultures where I do not speak the language, so it is very hard, but this project is something I am interested in, if only because the Bitcoin community seems to be strong and something I've never seen before. I still don't understand it, but it's something I want to understand and document with this show.

Good Question. Everywhere, but at this stage, I think that the links to the shows will only be listed here in the subreddit. You just have to join the Hobo Show subreddit at the address listed. I dont know how to do this so would appreciate your help or donations. For a small donation, a person can join, contribute and be part of the Hobo Show.

OK, Thank you. I will go to that subreddit and take a look around. I am totally new to all of this. For the proof, see below.

OK, I see now. Thank you.

Thank you for reminding me. It's open for other members to join. How does that work? I want to let the people in, for a small donation. Together they and I will build the Hobo Show. Once in, and when the episodes are up, they will have access to the links to the episodes.

OK Great. So how do I mine bitcoin with a computer? I don't have a desktop computer.
