The biggest risk in a bearish case in my opinion is ironically also one of Bitcoins biggest strengths in the energy committed to mining.  The oligopoly of hash power from so few mining farms paves the way for a 51% attack. I may not be up to date on the coding communities defenses against this though.
In any case it would appear net ongoing Bitcoin demand could, put crudely, drop 75% by 8 years time (2x halvings) and maintain a 1:1 inflation adjusted value ratio with the current price.
So, at a minimum this scenario would protect the purchasing power of your converted fiat savings by making them inflation resistant?
Bullish ��

Bear with me here, and as a pretext please I ask that you allow me to humor you with the load of shit im about to say:
Say for instance half the world puts all their savings into Bitcoin, it hits $1m practically overnight, causes mass panic in governments, US or China declare this as distributed financial terrorism and they decide to wage war on Bitcoin.
They then build enough mining farms and acheive 60% of all hash power. While I understand all nodes validate all transactions, would the above scenario allow the malicious actor to double spend and destabilise the network? What is the defense against that?
@_date: 2019-02-24 01:46:45

Chinese money pumping property prices is a myth. Poor economic policy is what has brought this to a head.
The introduction of neg gearing, constantly lowering interest rates and sub-prime lending is what has pumped the property market for the last 30 years. We've overleveraged these policies to the hills and now Australia backed itself into a corner of stagnation in the best case and recession if/when the panic sets in.
Every global occurrence of economic greed and mismanagement of this magnitude reinforces why Bitcoin is so important for the future of our families.

For those pushing the "my groceries will cost $9,999" argument, firstly hyperinflation generally does not happen to every currency simaltaneously.
Countries that mismanage their economies pick themselves off one by one when their dumpster fires gradually/inevitably get out of control.
Your local cash then loses all purchasing power, but your Bitcoin does not. 
This in itself does not increase Bitcoins global purchasing power, but when members of those individual economies are trying to figure out a way to preserve the value of their hard earned money where will they put it?

We already appear to be on that trajectory long term but no-one really knows when. I do know that when the selling is exhausted, when we hit that critical mass/equilibreum, the buying outweighs the selling, a halving or two if/when Bitcoin decides to boogie, it could happen pretty fast.

Every node should then be given a standard stake of influence in the network regardless of hashpower. That way individuals can have measurable network voting power to make it more distributed rather than concentrated in the mining farms.

@_date: 2019-02-23 06:37:47
That scenario has already played out.
There were 1,999? Bitcoin copies on Coinmarketcap in 2016/17.
They are not Bitcoin. Whats your point again?
@_date: 2019-02-23 04:38:53
This is meant to demonstrate how rare 1 Bitcoin is.
Let me try and explain why it matters for price:
Sellers are simply persons, companies, exchanges etc that invested in Bitcoin earlier and are now cashing out. Some are short term speculators cutting their losses after fomo'ing in at the peak and some are maybe long term holders taking profit. Or maybe a bit of both, you might have a long term holder cashing out because they feel the price is going lower...my point is that this is really all just noise in the long term. Youre either building or youre not.
Then you will have good news, bad news, governments telling you this will be the next reserve currency, or bluffing that they can/intend to outlaw Bitcoin and everything in between influencing speculators. Again, its just noise.
What matters is that say after all the noise there are net 10,000 genuine long term beleivers/builders still buying precious Bitcoin in 2019.
That means that every now and then, they use their fiat to buy a little more Bitcoin.
Even if no more long term builders/buyers join the fray over the next 8 years, the supply of new coins will be 75% less and the net long term demand roughly the same = higher price.
This is the Bitcoin policy that attracts builders (or should i coin the term buidlers).
If history repeats though, we will have a lot more new long term beleivers join Bitcoin once then next wave (after the sellers are exhausted) occurs. 
Do I make sense?
Someone proove me wrong I guess?

I am comparing Bitcoin vs Sydney property investment.
Isnt Negative gearing just an eoy tax deduction for  out of pocket expenses maintaining an investment property? 
If your property isnt appreciating in value, I consider those expenses to be a cashflow disruption and youre not really gaining any equity.

It's definately waaaay early but Lightning is taking off you know, like Lightning which is the right direction.
I'm starting to learn to zoom out, to see the benefits of Bitcoin. Having unconfiscatable, divisible, censorship resistant asset with a fixed/limited supply schedule that you can manage as an individual human being is empowering and has never before been possible. 
When you have events like 2008 and compare it to the way the "legitimate" fiat currencies are managed, I am glad we have Bitcoin.
