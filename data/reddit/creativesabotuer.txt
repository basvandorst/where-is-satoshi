Sounds neat, do post a how-to please. Spot on about LN nodes becoming defacto in personal computing devices, like phones, wallets  perhaps embedded biochips, cars(whatever form they take) not too sure about routers and TVs though.

What are your system specs?

I see how you're thinking about it, though for me, the device needs to have a interface likely to be used. Like a P.O.S at stores, retailers end up facing heavy transaction charges and long payment cycles from CC and payment networks for using card payments.

I think this is a epic moment, what a progressive and up leveling of the game by Wyoming! I'm off for a celebratory beer :)

Lovely post-rationalisation.
Dear friend, these are results of a system which sells to known behaviour. For, did you not have a choice to take the debt? For studies,  for the house, could there be other ways to think about it?
This current monetary system got us this far, perhaps it will not be the one to take it further, but it is of little value to belittle or berate it. 
Do you now think that smart/old money will simply suppress prices (with futures, cyclical trades, so many tricks learned from wall/main street) and buy in? Regulation is low, so it can definitely be happening. It happens in highly regulated markets, so it'll be criminal to assume it doesn't happen here.
The world has been going to hell and back for ages, and will probably keep doing so. Ask the french policemen currently considering which side they are on!
Bitcoin or fiat or _____ fill in the blank, what still works is, making good things happen and developing yourself. There are many people who have done a lot with less.
