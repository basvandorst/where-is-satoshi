We've already had the Bank of England openly discussing the idea of bypassing the entire commercial banking sector:
"I was really saying that if one imagined a very extreme example of a digital currency from the central bank, one that would gobble up and displace all these commercial bank deposits, we would end up with a particular kind of narrow banking structure. Essentially, you would have one enormous, nationalised narrow bank, and you and I would deposit at the central bank. We may hold some commercial bank deposits as well, but loans would then be funded in a rather different way, with more wholesale funding. As I say, the benefits of that might be that you end up with safer deposits."
And this with the stated objective of achieving those negative rates:
"If CBcoin were remunerated at the same rate as CB reserves, it would be interchangeable with reserves. And if the CB chose to replace cash with CBcoin, it could then charge a negative interest rate on deposits to bypass the dreaded zero lower bound, as considered by Kimball (2013) and Haldane (2015). In this scenario, the overall quantity of CB money would stay the same, only the composition of the CB liabilities would change."

Nobody wants to go comparing transaction size in bytes to fee amount and it's not reasonable to expect new users to be aware of the significance, but those two suggestions do a good job of suggesting a sensible fee and allowing you to adjust it.
If you're curious you can always check on  and some other sites.
Normally, your transaction won't be mined if the fee was zero, but there have been plenty of exceptions to that rule: 
If it's just a bit low, yeah just relax for 24 hours or so and it should be well confirmed.

I also find it hard to agree with Kaspersky on this.  Other incidents of blocking content and domains online have met some success, but not complete.
With something as sensitive as currency though, this touches on the authority and competence of central governments. And the Bitcoin protocol ensures that success would be even less limited than in the cases of torrents, a problem mainly solved by a better product offer, i.e. Netflix.
On the contrary, the countries which innovate most around the space will do well, which creates an economic pressure to be liberal around the technology.
The UK has been paying lip service to this, China has quietly been getting on with it.

From the Digital Assets site, this is the argument against Bitcoin:
"In theory, a shared, immutable ledger enables transparent, peer-to-peer, real-time settlement without the need for financial intermediaries. In reality, markets require known, reliable counterparties, rights of reversal and error correction, high levels of privacy and the operational benefits of net settlement in a system in which legal entities are responsible for the perfection of title to and legal standing of financial assets. Consequently, markets will continue to benefit from and require third party service providers to perform a variety of functions as they do today: from ensuring clean title, to enabling operational and balance sheet netting."
Actually Bitcoin does well by these benchmarks:  
- Blockchain publication lends itself to accurate counterparty risk management  
- m-of-n transactions and external data hooks allow for reversals  
- settlements and documents can be designed to meet the needs of national legal requirements
All very encouraging for Bitcoin, maybe not Digital Assets. For the investment worries, it looks like a simple no product, no money.

If you look at Star Xu's Sina Weibo account, you'll see there are questions and accusations, but almost no support.
We are hearing from the Chinese Bitcoin community, but we shouldn't expect people to communicate their concerns in English, especially if we're not prepared to make the equivalent effort.
There are many sweeping statements regarding China in these threads. There has long been an instinctive reciprocal mistrust between the bitcoin communities in the west and in China. I find it depressing and completely antithetical to the spirit of a global currency.
Times like these are an opportunity to develop mutual understanding but you have to create a space where Chinese people will be respected and engaged with as equals. Ask yourself is r/bitcoin really that?
Tldr: Star Xu doesn't represent China, bitcoin shouldn't lead to petty nationalism, take the chance to adopt a more nuanced worldview.

It's easy to criticize someone else, but apart from "allow everything" it's not as easy to come up with solutions. I understand the desire to keep a forum on-topic, and it's certainly not easy work.
Maybe Reddit's User Interface could be part of a solution for this.
The sidebar offers a place to show consideration for altcoins and developing soft or even hard forks.
Adding sections like this near the top would send a confident message, while allowing the forum contents to be focused on one thing.

I'm Damian, I was Product Manager (UX) at OKCoin at the time the company took over custody of bitcoin.com. I can confirm the OKCoin statement is delibrately misleading.
The intention of the CEO, Star Xu, was to use bitcoin.com to advertise OKCoin. I know this because he rejected my first wireframe and asked me to add 2 links to OKCoin, one on the homepage just below the navbar and another just a few hundred pixels down. I still have the wireframes. Xu's micromanagement of this project was among the reasons I left weeks later.
There was no plan for quality content at any point. No plan to add value to the bitcoin ecosystem. There was only a plan to advertise OKCoin.

Edit 2: I added a selection of the responses to the original 8btc post.
I can see from some of the posts I've read on various forums, there is a small but vocal part of the Chinese bitcoin community that feels this is an issue of having Chinese voices heard and not being excluded from the solution. 
One of the 8btc posters added a link to the github issue 50, but because Github use in China is limited, it might be interesting to create a Weibo hashtag or something to allow Chinese to more easily show support and show it's not an issue of the west imposing a solution on the Chinese community.

Just imagine a block chain used for medical 'transactions', which served as a reference for employers but wasn't available to the public. I don't think that would be a good blockchain, don't think it would make Bitcoin more popular. 
Insurance maybe is different. But given the premises of the report, it's fair not to be optimistic.

Bitcoin is neutral. Everyone chooses to participate and is treated indiscriminately by the network.
There is no guarantee that transparency would be equally distributed in these private "block chains", almost certainly the opposite.
That's the difference between a decentralized architecture and a distributed architecture, and the sense in which transparency can have negative consequences.
If you think transparency is good per se, don't be a hypocrite next time you play poker.

His English isn't an issue there, but just in case a reply to some of his posts from Luke Jr were sent in Chinese to his Weibo, and he didn't directly reply there either. He does engage with quite a few other Weibo users but you'll notice his Twitter feed contains very few replies.
I'd agree that he shows little sign of a will to compromise. His latest public posts are to reaffirm his support for BU and to repeat his slogan that 'big blocks must win'.
I think a more tangible representation of his red line is a refusal to scale Bitcoin through 2nd layers.  I'm curious as to whether Core actually rule out scaling in any other way, or simply say a secure means to do remains to be found.

Core must hard fork to change how PoW is calculated to have a chance of survival. Big blocks must win!

And changing that calculation is hard work. Big blocks must win!

I suggest that during a hard fork, people be cautious about buying coins on the small block chain. Because that chain's future existence has problems. What you buy might be like a warrant days away from expiration.
对普通用户而言，在硬分叉阶段，最安全的措施就是什么都不要动。把历史性的价格决战，留给对于风险有承受能力、对于形势有（自我认为的）清晰认知的人吧！ ​​​

This would be an appealing image to present in China, although given the decisive strategic advantage of Taobao was zero-fee listings, difficult to reconcile with the role of miners as fee-collectors. Taobao were the underdogs and Bitmain are dominant. But his point about strategy and code quality being competing factors may resonate with Chinese who take pride in Taobao's success.
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:34:23


This is true but maybe not the whole truth. He has refused all public direct contact so far, but it's fair to say he's communicating in his own way, he knows he has the ear of the devs who participate in Core and he's aware of their responses to his statements.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:00:21


This is a little harsh. The arguments in this paper are convincing, but neither of us have as much at stake as Bitmain. It's hardly surprising they're hesitant to embrace a leap into the unknown at this point.


But the best solution for this isn't to downgrade the hashing power underpinning the network. With a few admirable exceptions in the mining space, Bitcoin companies in Western countries have focussed more on retail, exchanges, gambling and funds. China has focussed on mining and exchanges, partly due to legislation there. And now they have the most advanced mining company by far.
I think in future they'll have a rival or two. For now, maybe they do get some support but I'm sure they're also wondering why nobody can touch them.
@_date: 2016-01-19 12:24:52
You are confusing distributed and decentralized, and the report explicitly states, as I quoted, "For government applications, ‘permissioned’ ledgers are likely to be more appealing than Bitcoin’s unpermissioned model."
Parliament doesn't legislate based on YouTube videos. It rejects, notes or adopts recommendations contained in reports by arms-length bodies such as these, and generally implements them in a politically expedient manner.
@_date: 2016-01-19 11:58:44
This is completely inaccurate. Read first, comment second.
"But this report is not about Bitcoin."
"The first difficulty in communication is the strong association of block chain technology with Bitcoin."
"A particular term that can cause confusion is ‘distributed’, which can lead to the misconception that because something is distributed there is therefore no overall controlling authority or owner."
"For government applications, ‘permissioned’ ledgers are likely to be more appealing than Bitcoin’s unpermissioned model"
This is just the latest attempt to hijack Bitcoin. The transparency of the Bitcoin Blockchain in hands like these will lead to nothing but trouble.

I'm afraid there were no direct responses. This post from a few hours later may not be coincidental, so I'll include it just in case:


There’s no saviour, no supreme emperor. BU is an open-source community in a process of continuous improvement, it has consistently remained true to its grassroots support. Bitmain stands resolutely on the side of BU, progressively raising the quality of the software.

@_date: 2017-03-21 22:28:26
It's precisely because I think the situation is pretty serious that I think it's better to choose words carefully.
The mining situation is delicate. The industry lends itself to centralisation, the supply chain has become dominated by China and the business environment in China is very competitive. Bitmain openly state their desire to rival the big players in finance there - Alipay and Wechat. Their expectations for on-chain scaling without 2nd layer protocols are tied to that ambition.
If they could be assured their strong position leaves them a fair shot at playing part of something on that scale, I wonder if the threat to 51% wouldn't subside. Ultimately there may be other ways to deal with those threats but it would be nice to come out of this with Bitmain and its hashing power as part of the ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:45:45
All good, I think the point is well made.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:27:53
He's not a miner, no. He did post a comment in the other thread explaining his view a bit more, I posted a link to it just below / above.


The use of the term 手续费 in the original article may be a catch-all for block rewards and miner fees, to make it a more accessible read. That's not super clear at the moment.


My impression is Bitmain want a network that can rival Alipay / Wechat wallet asap. See Jihan's Weibo post from today: 
And they seem to view bigger blocks as the only acceptable way to achieve it, the unacceptable alternative being Lightning Network somehow capturing all the fees on a 2nd layer protocol.
Nobody's actually asking Jihan which parts of the article he agreed with when he posted it, maybe that would help clear things up too.
@_date: 2016-01-22 01:32:14
Chinese miners have often said they want a solution on the existing blockchain, and you can also see in jtoomim's conversation regarding his talks in China, they insisted he submit a PR to Core in the first instance, so they are acting in line with the statements.
It's no secret they want a solution on Core. They have also said they'd like to, in a reasonable and secure manner, expand block size over time, and support for SegWit is high.

- It caused Jihan Wu's response to focus on correcting the error caused by the sensationalised title;
- It caused a Core dev to have to correct his statement below.
- It means attention is diverted from the more important question:   exactly what elements of the post did Jihan Wu agree with as he decided to post it to Weibo?

Here's a pretty new thread on 8btc about this: 
You'll see there's one guy who mentions MtGox, he's a bit worried that although customer service have been nice to him, he's starting to wonder how much is really true.
Not much concern though, given the hold up. If there were concerns around liquidity / solvency, everyone could have withdrawn in RMB and caused a run, but they haven't.

At the end there is a note with further explanation:
"Why 90% CPU consensus?
Because some miners do not belong to public pools (individuals or private pools), it’s difficult for this group to express their wishes.
Excluding this silent CPU and asking for 90% consensus is equivalent to asking for 95% consensus among all public pools."

This was a bit odd. The man who spoke at 6:43 follows the CCTV voice saying there's no certainty technology will be secure.
He says, "if I bought a lot of bitcoins and I suddenly noticed a 'spirit'* appeared, and suddenly there existed twice as many bitcoins, the bitcoins in my hand wouldn't be worth anything, would they? This doubt is always at the back of your mind."
The other speakers are all from the industry and reasonable, he comes off as relatively odd.

This goes against the grain of events in China.
- Ongoing support for 'controlling the means of production'
- Clarification that use of bitcoin as currency was banned
- Announcement that the government was working on its own cryptocurrency
Nothing suggests that there's a space for Bitcoin wallet services within the China market.
The most likely explanation I can think of is that merchants in China may be allowed to accept bitcoin payments from overseas, which would then be converted into CNY, as an attempt to counter the threat OpenBazaar etc. pose to traditional Yuan-denominated B2B sales.

I'll have a go at presenting some counter-arguments.
Bitmain also play a huge role in securing the network, and operate in an area where centralisation is inherent to the design of the protocol.


- Marcus Streng, Genesis Mining: 
Jihan Wu's position was made clear in a NYT article last year:






The current situation was predicted in 2010:


- Theymos, October 01, 2010, 04:12:31 PM, 
In the same thread, Satoshi replied but didn't object to this or express any concern.
Most significantly, Bitmain operate in a business where they stand to lose if they get too big. The counter-balance to the inherent centralisation is network trust. They show their commitment to the value of the network by holding coins:


Aside from Bitmain's holdings, the personal holdings of Jihan Wu and Ketuan Zhan were most recently estimated at 100,000 BTC and 60,000 BTC respectively - 
That represents a lot of commitment to the future health of the network.

- recent bull market following difficult period
- brief history of Bitcoin
- fixed cap / scarcity
- halvening (减半)
- use as currency in China / rest of world
- CN govt restrictions / influence on price
- alternative use cases: investment / risks

- deflationary currency
- China's share of global trading volume / risk
Overall impression is it's a gentle warning to the average Chinese to exercise caution.

I haven't seen any progress recently, but there were a few papers on central bank coins.
In the RSCoin proposal, a central bank controls the money supply and 'mintettes' play the role of banks today as well as preventing double spending:   
In the CBDC proposal, they consider fixed nominal value as well as price targeting, leading to zero inflation:  
Also related, some Australian deputies just mentioned holding bitcoin at the RBA and using it to conduct traditional inflation-targeting market operations:  
Although I know most bitcoin users wouldn't be too keen on these proposals, the BoE considered the ability of individuals / companies to hold crypto accounts directly at the central bank as a means of negating the moral hazard in banking implicit in a too-big-to-fail situation.
As a more direct response to OP, mass adoption.

I'm not qualified to answer that well, but the statement no. 289 referred to, where bitcoin is defined as a virtual commodity which can be exchanged and traded but cannot rival the domestic hegemony of the Renminbi, seems to contain the relevant provisions. No change, just a reminder in the face of increased volumes and volatility, and a reminder to keep the books in order. No cause for alarm whatsoever.

This is in line with the approach taken so far, which is to have prominent warnings to deter reckless investments going wrong at times of high volatility. They do the same in other areas that attract retail investors, with a view to economic stability.
The arguments used aren't really technical because that wouldn't appeal to the target audience, hence the focus on tulips and hackers. At the same time, they've just provided a good bit more regulatory certainty and trading volumes aren't that high anyway.

These 'features' strike me as the reason they're interested in the first place, without them it'd be surprising if they'd proceed. The ability to implement negative rates must be particularly attractive just now, but except China nobody seems to be pushing ahead very quickly so it would be too late anyway.
Cash and debit seems preferable then, but CB crypto could be better than digital-only fiat like the Swedish proposal.
I'd like to see a Bitcoin-based altcoin with a coin supply responsive to economic conditions, just to test out the competing economic theories, though as a global currency it might face problems similar to the Euro's. I'm a bit disappointed by mainstream economic theory's unwillingness to put itself to the test with a crypto implementation.

This is the debate mentioned by  here:  
Here's a quick summary of the show, too long to do subtitles:
- Main theme is, what is currency exactly?
- History of money, from sea shells through metals to paper money (for easy taxation) to digital currency. Each step represents progress in civilisation;
- The most recent step forward is "virtual currency", such as Bitcoin, Litecoin or Dogecoin.
**Economist Xuanfeng Lang**
- Given the 123% YoY price rise, and recent investigations of exchanges, he'll look at the pros and cons of Bitcoin; 
-  Price growth is explosive, compares it on YoY terms with gold, CNY, Shanghai Stock Exchange, Shenzhen second hand real estate (13.5%), but that doesn't mean people should go invest;
- 50% of the first 13m coins are held by 950 people, 80% of all coins are held by early investors. Early investors buy high volumes at low prices, late investors buy low volumes at high prices - this makes it a Ponzi scheme;
- To attract new entrants: 24h trading creates inflated trading volumes. Higher search engine results lead to higher prices, showing how rumours lead to price spikes. Marketing mBTC units gives the impression of holding more.
- Shows risks with the pump and dump of Quarkcoin, Zetacoin, Litecoin. Greater fool analogy. Recommends not investing.
**CUFE Professor Wang Fuzhong**
- First and foremost Bitcoin is an investment asset that has always increased in value, and it's a currency of genuine significance.
- Currency is what people accept as value, it doesn't require government backing, which is a relatively new concept. People trust Bitcoin's math and tech. It's proved it's utility in cross-border transactions.
- He's asked how can the number of coins be controlled, and what makes Bitcoin different. Describes founding principles as distributed memory, cryptography and consensus, which together make it extremely secure - never been hacked.
- The reason central banks everywhere are researching cryptocurrency is a presents a huge challenge for them.
- Bitcoin isn't anonymous, every transaction can be traced.
- Governments are unable to shut down Bitcoin. The only thing under investigation is the exchange network.
That's enough, I hope, to show that it was a fairly balanced debate and the discussion was open and informed.
Edit: thanks so much for the gold, much appreciated.

This is in line with the other press releases on the subject.
Edit: To add, this is exactly what was suggested in the previous press releases, where they said they would take steps to better understand the exchanges. Now they're doing exactly that. This is a huge market over-reaction to something we already knew was going to happen in some form or another.

Interesting concluding paragraph, suggests a move away from attempts to tarnish Bitcoin by association with criminality:
"Decentralized currencies arose because people wanted to transact in a digital world without having to ask permission. The extent to which this facilitates criminal activity depends entirely on the prevalence of criminal activity in the real world. Maybe that’s a problem that needs to be addressed outside the monetary system."

A related problem is that retailers will often sell their bitcoins within the day, so you can have a consumer exchanging USD for BTC, and the retailer then exchanging BTC for USD. It makes no sense.
If the retailer were able to pay their suppliers in BTC though, they'd be able to hold a greater amount and the BTC transaction would start to make sense. But given China's dominance in manufacturing and the legal situation around accepting BTC for goods there, this is unlikely. Added to this is the relatively small number of major logistics companies, none of whom accept bitcoin.
So perhaps the most valuable projects for bitcoins as medium of exchange are those where as much of the supply chain as possible is denominated in BTC.

The platform was pressed to inspect details of their own business and implement measures to ensure it is returned to order, as per the relevant statutory legislation.
According to statement from the People’s Bank of China, Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory Commission, China Insurance Regulatory Commission on the prevention of risk pertaining to Bitcoin (No. 289, 2013), Bitcoin is designated as a virtual commodity, and does not possess the payment and enforceability properties of currency, does not hold a legal status equal to currency, cannot and should not circulate as currency in the marketplace. Institutional and individual investors should view virtual commodities and virtual currencies appropriately, invest rationally, bear all risks themselves, maintain the security of their assets and establish a correct and proper view of currency and investments."

It seems since you're effectively taking a short position with the intention of closing it out in the near future, it might actually be more prudent to use futures / swap contracts with some leverage to balance counterparty risk and the benefit of easy stop-loss orders.
This is part of the argument for those contracts, that they remove speculation from the underlying asset and contribute to decreasing volatility in the spot price. If you agree with the logic, by using them you'd be making that contribution yourself.

Each lost coin affects the value of each unit of a deflationary currency. The degree of scarcity is directly affected.
For example, if you buy a bitcoin, you take a position on whether or not you think Satoshi's coins will move. Personally, I tend to think not, but if I'm wrong I've overpaid for my coins.
It would be useful if a person could tag UTXOs as beyond control on a block explorer, although obviously they couldn't prove it. Aside from the price issue, after a certain point, they would also provide an opportunity for ethical hacking.

Thanks for your reply. It's interesting because there's no central authority to designate a right way of approaching it, and each private company generally occupies one part of the landscape so it's often left up to the user to put the pieces together.
If you take an approach from block explorer to wallets to exchange and possibly a node, you have quite a range of service providers along the way and that's a good thing too. I can see how a percentage of people get lost each step of the way but I'm sure we could do more to make all the avenues ahead clear.

China wants to develop its capacity in chip manufacturing. The US and its allies are trying to prevent it. See for example:
The best-placed company to compete with the industry leaders would be Foxconn:
"The choice of chip type is crucial. There's no way that Foxconn can compete with Qualcomm in communications chips, nor could it take on Intel or Samsung in processors. However, there's a huge market for the little-known yet high-demand chips called application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, and application-specific standard products, or ASSPs."
So it's possible these companies are operating at a short-term loss, with high-level support and / or in the hopes of an eventual takeover.

I would be very wary of the mixed messages the current government is sending regarding Bitcoin - given the quantity of discourse regarding the creation of a business community around it, it's odd to say the least that no effort appears to have been made to persuade banks in which the same government is a major investor to actually service bitcoin companies.

Where's a good place to read about the game-theoretical implications of a UASF?
My ideal is an outcome that maintains the combination of Core devs and high levels of hashing power underlying the network. In that case, it'd be good if any pool could signal support for Segwit if / when it becomes visibly inevitable.

@_date: 2016-02-12 18:51:35
Agree with u/paperraincoat. China also has the particularity of bitcoin not being allowed for transactions and yet it has maintained a stake in the network by focusing on its macro strengths, manufacturing and low commodity prices, through individuals taking extremely high-risk positions that have yet to pay off for them as much as they have for those of us on the other end of transactions.
You can either do something about the fundamental reasons why other countries can't compete in certain areas of the infrastructure, or bide your time and stick to mastering those areas in which you have a chance. Good projects like Trezor are proof of this. There are plenty of barriers to global participation in mining pools to remove. You could work on PoS and other alternative consensus techniques. 
The fact that more people aren't working on these things indicates they're probably more confident than you in the overall security of the network.

3/ Hard forks are somewhat similar to a presidential election - having one every week would be too disruptive, but once every four years...  
4/ Probably a good way to ensure forward progress

I'm not an academic at all, but if it's useful:


This disparity was caused by the existence of a no-fee model on Chinese exchanges. When this was removed as part of the recent measures taken by the PBoC, trading volume collapsed on those exchanges. The drop was only partly compensated for by increases on other trading platforms and marketplaces.
The high volumes during no-fee trading on Chinese exchanges were mainly bot-driven. These bots had no extra information to trade on as a result of the zero-fee policy and so they mainly exacerbated trends. This means the contribution of derivative products to stability was offset by the consequences of the zero-fee / bot combination.
Since that's now almost irrelevant, your conclusion that "it is fair to assume that China is the most significant external factor that will influence Bitcoin's volatility" may be worth revisiting.


For the same reasons as above, this may be worth revisiting as well.


There seems to be an implicit assumption that in order to "satisfy the criteria of being a currency", Bitcoin should only be a currency. But it functions similarly to a commodity as well. You may miss some relevant conclusions if your characterisation of Bitcoin is pointed towards your thesis. For example, if a free-floating Yuan were to lose value, Bitcoin would behave differently to other national fiat currencies in response.


Bitcoin's fiat price volatility could decrease while technical constraints meant mass adoption threatened decentralisation, or some other factor could interfere with the causality here. Maybe worth a bit of caution on that level when discussing mass adoption.

It would be helpful to draw attention to existing public / private investment in cryptocurrency / blockchain research, to gain signatories from government agencies and private sector participants.
It would be encouraging to show more clearly these are classic techniques LEAs are well experienced in tackling, by pointing to successful prosecutions against those engaged in similar activities.
It would add emotional impact to provide evidence of the fragility of those who are most commonly impacted and point to human stories of victims of similar activities.

Well, Bitsquare is solving the decentralised fiat / crypto puzzle, but people who trade on sites like finex need fast transactions and more advanced order types, at the very least all these: 
These are the two problems that haven't been solved that explain the continued success of centralised trading platforms.

If you like bitcoin, I'm sure you appreciate deposit guarantee schemes use game theory to increase stability in the banking system.
They were introduced after the bank runs that led to the Great Depression, but over time there has been some "innovation" in pricing risk and they have become smaller in relation to bank liabilities. If they do their job well, they prevent shocks. If a shock happens, don't count on them and if possible have some bitcoin.

They were managing the Bitfinex segregated wallets at the time of the BTC120,000 theft.
Their CEO confirmed all my doubts the other day in a WhaleClub interview:

They're telling you if you aren't the only one in possession of your private keys, then you can't be said to truly control your bitcoins.
If you use a Blockchain.com wallet service, you won't achieve this level of control. If you want to buy research chemicals and do so within a few transactions of your Circle purchase, don't count on that account remaining open indefinitely.
You can create your own cold wallet offline via  transfer some over to a GreenAddress or Copay wallet and use this for daily transactions.

I'm concerned that this is to be implemented in partnership with BitGo; it looks like it would require a segregated wallet setup too.

Not mentioned in yesterday's thread but relevant is the reward structure for the bitcoin.com pool, which pays out 110% of the block reward and makes its money by keeping the remainder of the transaction fees.

The UK government took Blockchain.info on their fintech trip to SE Asia, invited the same company to speak to a parliamentary committee about cryptocurrency and continue to try to brand London as a fintech destination.
Meanwhile, they have a 73% stake in RBS and still around 10% of Lloyds, and neither bank will commit to providing business banking services to bitcoin companies.

The suggestion is that, in the event of negative interest rates being applied to savings directly, measures like this make it inconvenient to hold cash when you're supposed to be out spending.
This is much bigger news for Bitcoin than the latest who's SN story.

Thanks, I'll look again at BIP 149. I hadn't realised it was directly in response to those concerns.

"If they are the arbiters of transactions, there is no need for mining, and thus no need for a blockchain, per se." - Erik Voorhees  
"Distributed ledger technology does have the potential to be disruptive of certain business models. But it has at least as much potential to be enormously empowering of existing business models" - Blythe Masters  
These two often discuss the same issues, from differing perspectives. Her company is called Digital Assets, he's the original innovator in digital assets. If they had a debate, I'd definitely watch.
I feel like the future of Bitcoin will be somewhere between their visions of it.

The Deputy Governor of the Bank of England has been taking questions so far:
- They're looking at a non-fractional centrally-banked token with direct accounts for individuals at the Bank;
- They don't have an alternative to PoW;
- They'll require identity to access their blockchain;
- One Lord is concerned about terrorism and dragons, another is a director of a bank and is concerned about savings.
Now it's the academics and private sector.

I worked with him at OKCoin. He's been behaving very oddly for a long time now.
I did use Binance once in the past, but I wouldn't think of it these days.
Edit: Someone asked by PM how he'd changed:
I never knew him very well but he talked like he was a bit of a cypherpunk back in the day.
He met with Vitalik in Shanghai a while before Binance, I suppose to discuss ERC20, then he went into billionaire mode.
His actions that I've taken as big red flags recently are:
- Binance uses the KYC/AML systems required by the Chinese Communist Party when closing down exchanges there;
- The partnership with Justin Sun and related pump and dumps;
- His doing publicity with Bobby Lee, despite what he'd said about the latter in the past;
- The announcement of an odd children's charity with Jihan Wu, which looks more like an accounting exercise;
- The announcement of a fund for hodlonaut's legal fees, a month after one was already established by Elizabeth Stark to great success;
- And now this 'hack' and surrounding controversy.
Maybe there's an innocent explanation, but the list just keeps getting longer.

The actual quote, in response to whether "the prospect of a digital currency is, in your view, some way off?", was:


So this is referring not just to the creation of a centralised cryptocurrency, but also major reform of the banking sector and its relationship with the central bank. Even the suggestion of all that seems quite significant, but nobody in attendance picked up on it.
At another point he mentioned they knew they would require a centralised service accessible on proof of national identity, but they don't know what the technology would look like or what consensus mechanism the blockchain would use, so it still sounds like early days.
The BoE deputy governor seemed very aware of the existential questions posed by Bitcoin, but neither he nor any of the guests afterwards, nor any of the Lords, were too clear about how centralised blockchains would work or be helpful.
The company providing some kind of blockchain for welfare payments tracking was called GovCoin (yes it was), not much online presence.
