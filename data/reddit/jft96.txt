I actually have no dogecoins, nor I have ever owned dogecoins. Also, what exact pun are you talking about? I am clearly missing it.

 Yeah, embarrassed yourself.

Then I guess it paid of for you... But, I still have an opinion that it was pointless.

Resistant to wild inflation? This couldn't be more far from truth...
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:48:09


 What? You realize that you wrecked more worth device than the one you got now. I certainly don't see point of this, but OK.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:13:25
They take too big fees in my opinion, but of course they are gonna take some fees for internet banking, transaction fees and withdrawals...
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:11:43
Where could I buy like 0.05 BTC (don't have more money), I just set up blockhain wallet?? Can someone tell me, still relatively new to BTC, and hopefully they could rise even more?
@_date: 2013-12-08 23:25:18
are you being serious?
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:16:18
maybe, but you certainly have ignorance and lack of intelligence in your country...
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:04:10
Yeah, I just opened a wallet few days ago, and I am seriously thinking of buying some bitcoins. I can't buy it a lot unfortunately, but I could at least afford about $60 worth of bitcoins... Sky is the limit for bitcoins I hope!!
@_date: 2013-11-30 11:34:59
Hehehe Janez!!! U redu je...
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:13:45
how much BTCs do you have, just out of curiosity you don't have to answer?
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:01:54
the worst thing is that I wanted to buy them when they were $650, and now they are around $1150 and I still have NO bitcoins at all. I thought that at least someone on Reddit could easily sell me, since these BTCs are really hard to buy for some fucking reason...
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:53:13
croatia, Europe
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:53:51
you think that bitcoin price will decrease?
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:43:47
I will, thanks :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:14:13
nah, you didn't :(

@_date: 2013-11-28 13:58:30
What about mt.Gox, do they sell BTCs, and how reliable are they?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:47:59
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:49:59
Is there anyone on reddit who sells bitcoins reliably and quickly? I just want to buy like 0.07 BTCs
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:39:19
yeah, I just searched that I want to buy bitcoins in my area (around $70 worth of BTCs), and I got NO search results. Only two possible ways for me to buy are two offers, which have payment method of some OKPay which I don't really have. I can only pay with Paypal or direct bank transfer... HELP someone :)
I wanted to buy them 3 days ago when they were $750, and now they are $1000, I don't want to see them getting to like $1500 with knowing that I didn't even tried to buy at least small amount of BTCs
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:20:48
I am trying to find some easy way to buy few BTCs without too much verifications that I need to handle by buying through mt.gox and all those crap... No need to pity me, just I am getting jealous when I see how BTC is every day getting bigger by $100 and I still don't have any...
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:32:58
yeah, I guess I need to open OKPay account for that. Don't even have an idea if they are reputable and how much time will it take me. I am only interested in buying around $60-$70 worth of BTCs. Nothing much...
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:45:23
Yeah, I did for WHOLE country (not living in a big country BTW)... Only 2 available options and it is OKPay which I don't have, and I really don't want to set it up...
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:57:16
then how could I SIMPLY buy this kind of small amount of BTCs... I can pay through direct bank transfer also... I seriously thought someone could sell me on BITCOIN subreddit at least 0.07 BTCs
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:15:17
ok, I am still relatively new to BTCs... COuld you explain me why does someone's area of living matters?
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:30:25
There are 2 but there only payment method is OKPay, and I don't have that, never heard of it even. I currently don't have no bitcoins in wallet, but I would be keen just to buy some small portion of it, something like 0.07 BTCs... If anyone reputable on reddit could sell me it would be great...
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:23:07
yeah, that's too long process since I am not planning to buy MANY BTCs, I just want to buy BTCs worth around $80, and since probably many people on this subreddit have many bitcoins, I thought someone could sell me like 0.07 BTCs...
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:23:19
thanks man, but you really didn't have to! I don't even understand on how to transfer this mbtc but I will find out....
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:07:43
then how should I buy these small amount of BTCs?
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:36:39
This is the same question as: Can money buy happiness? 
No it can't, but if you are unhappy it is better to cry in a Ferrari, then in a dirty subway... Money (bitcoins) can't buy you happiness, but lack of it could certainly get you unhappiness...
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:34:43
Well that escalated quickly :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:54:55
Still new to BTCs, but why are they so hard to buy??? I thought their main purpose would be to simplify buying through online or whatever. Buying BTCs is really hard... 
Do I need to verify myself through btc-e???
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:35:42
yeah, but their is basically no one even nearly close in my area in localbitcoins.com... 3 people in my country, but no one in my city. I seriously thought that BTCs would be easier to buy...
@_date: 2013-11-30 09:53:29
aaaaaaaaaaarghhh I told in post that I can't... NO AVAILABLE OFFERS IN MY AREA!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:56:15
Congrats man, if only I was smarter one year ago when I first heard for Bitcoins...
