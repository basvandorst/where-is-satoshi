I am sorry but there was never a happy ending to the bitcoin story for everyone. The price went up because many people put money in. And price goes down when you take money out. There was always going to be a few winners and a lot of losers. The only way for bitcoin to end well for everyone who "invested" in it was if it became the world's currency. But it did not even come close to doing that. I am not sure what kind of universe you guys were imagining where everyone buys low and everyone sells high and everyone becomes rich...

I went to great length to explain about why a bank or a factory stock is different than something that does nothing that people pour money into. But you don't want to bother with logic, you already made up your mind.

It does not matter how high "your investment" goes as long as you do not sell it to get that money. You guys are just putting money in, watching a graph move around, and extremely few of you make any money at all, the majority just loses...Because the profits of the few are the losses of the masses, that is how a Pyramid scheme works...

Invest in a bank as in purchase bank stocks. Banks loan money to people, who use that money to build factories, buy cars to go to work etc and pay back interest. It does not matter how high or low it goes, bitcoin is not producing money, any money you make is someone else's money that he lost without benefit. You might as well all of you put your money in a spinning wheel and randomly redistribute it... Both cases are exactly the same, no value was created, some got more money than they put in and some got less money...

You are looking at it wrong, no one knows what the top of the market is, never feel bad about a sale for profit. Nothing other than sheer luck is what gets people to sell at a peak...

I am not suggesting people sell low. I am suggesting people don't play this game at all... and invest in something real like a bank or a factory...
