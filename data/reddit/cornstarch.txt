How do people purchase small amounts of bitcoin like that? Do they buy it from random people at market value or are they buying it from exchanges and paying the fees for each transaction ?

I'm confused, is this to support trump?

Why do they want their own digital currency rather than just using bitcoin?

I figured having the paper wallet locked up in combination with having the bread wallet would be a pretty sound solution. I feel that my iPhone is pretty secure and if it was ever lost it could be remotely wiped. much like a hardware wallet right?

I'm confused - the breadwallet app issues me a 12 word pass phrase. How would this be any different? Thanks

I used bitaddress.org. Do you consider that a secure option?

in this thread there is people saying it will end in 2040 and others saying 2140. How come such a varying opinion?

blockchain.info has the twelve word phrase back up as well, but that doesn't make a lot of sense to me because I imagine blockchain the company would have to be still up and running for the backup phrase to do anything wouldn't it?

Eventually down the road when I do want to spend the funds, how would I do that? Import the private keys into blockchain or some other wallet?

Andreas really pushes the micro transaction argument and how fees are "fractions of a penny" but it seems like every transaction I do costs me 4-7 cents. Is he wrong or what is going on?

what a time to be alive!
@_date: 2016-09-29 00:18:02
So is this going to be a separate crypto currency, or will this be implemented behind the scenes for us regular folk using bitcoin?

If I'm just holding on to my bitcoins and not using them for every day purchase, is a hardware wallet really more secure than a paper wallet? What if the hardware wallet breaks?

Where do you buy coins on a monthly basis so that the fees don't gouge you?

Just for my own knowledge, if his coins were stored on a cold wallet, would he have avoided this issue?
