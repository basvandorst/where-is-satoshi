I know that. Purse *is* technically the owner of this address, and the coins I sent should have immediatly been used to fund my order and my balance should be close to zero by now, with my ordered processed. The problem is that none of this happened. They didn't record the fact that I sent the funds. My dashboard still shows "waiting for payment", thus my unrest.
I could perfectly understand if they told me they met some technical issue during the processing of my transaction, *if only they took a look at support requests* their customers send.

Well no. Like I said in my post, I first contacted support 6 days ago, corresponding to 4 business days, which is more than enough to at least let me know that the problem was being taken into account.


It has resolved now. My coins have finally arrived in escrow and my order is currently processing so I guess it's OK. It's just a pity that I had to hail them publicly to get their attention.
Anyway, thanks all for your responses.

That's what I thought at first, that my funds were being moved by Purse themselves to a cold storage. But I sent my bitcoin as a payment for an active order, so it should have ended up in my hot wallet, which isn't the case.

No, but I've connected to my Purse account from different computers (home, work, mobile) with different web browsers and checked that the Bitcoin address displayed for my escrow wallet remained the same. It is, so this kind of attack is unlikely, unless Purse website itself has been hacked.
