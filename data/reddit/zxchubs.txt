I guess not a complete scam but it leans toward centralization

Better to use segwit chain

Hey mate, start with Coinbase! Just make sure you are aware of the fees... Once you’ve setup your Coinbase account, you’ve got access to GDAX as well. You can transfer your BTC from Coinbase to GDAX (check google or youtube) for no fee then send to your wallet for free as well.

I guess this is a good time for merchants and store to accept and embrace bitcoin payments
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:01:41
Alright, we’ll watch... then?

Gdax, Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:21:20
That should be a nice tool to monitor P&amp;L. I’ll check and download after work. Thanks mate.

I understand your point and we are all here already. I guess, a better thing to do is to educate everyone who comes aboard on the technology. It’s disruptive but that’s what creates its value. An investor should be understand bitcoin and blockchain as well, not just a speculator. I believe in the vision of what this technology can bring, not only in banking and finance, but change among all industries. Imagine an banks wanted to operate and think as a tech company now. Andreas A’s talk recently reflects it.
Better for noobs to read Satoshi’s whitepaper. This group has a lot of good resources to be frank to start.

Yeah, there is mbtc and satoshi
1 mbtc = 0.001 btc
1 sat = 0.00000001 btc

Cheers to that! They’re paid media.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:28:33
Amen to that!

Btcmarket should work
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:58:17
You can use coinjar or localbitcoin to sell.

Here’s my satoshi,
1. Read references about bitcoin. I started here which includes Satoshi’s whitepaper, bitcoin.org.
2. If you’re investing, know the risks. That’s why you need to understand bitcoin and the technology.
3. Setup a bitcoin wallet. I started with Blockchain but there are lots of fantastic wallets like Mycellium.
4. You can start buying bitcoin in Coinbase. But once you boughy some, it’s better to transfer your bitcoin to your wallet.
5. Hodl and read more about bitcoin and its use.

Earlier, I’m using wallet from blockchain.info since it can hold both my btc and eth. I’m satisfied with it until I move to Ledger Nano S. Moving to a hardware wallet is a safe and sound decision.
