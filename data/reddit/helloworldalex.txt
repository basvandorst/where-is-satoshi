Most of the people my age (31) or in their 20s don't really get it yet. I've been into it for years, but only bought my first batch a couple months ago. It will catch on fast. 
We are [here](

I'll bet you 1 bitcoin that this will exist and that I can film myself getting a ride in one by 2030. Probably about 5 years before that, but I'm trying to be cautious. 
EDIT: I just downloaded the lazooz app (see current top comment) and it looks like I'll beat my time by about 14 years.

That was a great read! You remind me of me.

Take out Uber's cut, price drops another 20% or so. Run it on electricity from solar panels, price drops another 10% or so. Remove the driver entirely, we are talking about a taxi costing &lt;10% of what an Uber costs today, i.e. cheaper than a bus ticket. :)

I can sell you one of those for a mere 20 BTC

I haven't lost anything that I know of. It might have gone down a couple bucks. The point isn't investment. That isn't exciting, there are a million things you could invest in. What is exciting to me is the ability to buy instantly, store value for free, and not have to support the status quo of debt, wage slavery etc.

|the Bitcoin Foundation has been a net benefit, and Cody Wilson is an embarrassing spokesperson for Bitcoin
debatable, not really a counterpoint to anything he said. Also Bitcoin doesn't have "spokespeople." Anyone who wants to can weigh in. I personally am hugely grateful to have his voice

What if we created a twitterbot that tweets him positive bitcoin news daily... mwahaha!

If only they could pay their bills in Bitcoin... Sounds like an opportunity. Assuming you mean electric bills, maybe Solar City could be convinced to take it? I wouldn't hold my breath as far as more traditional electric companies though.

I knew someone on here would have said what I wanted to express. Well said. I don't get how Buffet wouldn't see that US dollars are no different...

Thats exactly what I've been looking for. An intro to the blockchain course that *is* technical, and covers the programming behind it. Or, I'd love a curated list of good courses (math, cryptography, algorithms etc) to work my way through that would lead me towards really understanding the technology. Maybe even prepare me to create a crypto currency. Anyone?
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:44:45
thanks! Yeah I can code, but mostly just web dev stuff mostly so far. I'm excited to get into more.
@_date: 2015-05-27 19:45:43
That's amazing!
@_date: 2014-10-23 01:04:57
Woah really? Thanks! I haven't been there for a while.

YES! Decentralized Uber is the future! 
Just the useful tool, no one taking a cut.
Taxi drivers make all the money. 
Then are replaced by self-driving cars.
Then it costs very very little to move about.
Then I no longer have to take the bus ftw.

I love this but that text shadow eeewwwwgghhh.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:20:04
Thanks! I can't believe how simple it is to do this. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:15:53
I'd love to get in on this! I learned the basics yesterday so my few cents didn't expire. I'm so excited. To the future!

Hi Ryan, 
I've been thinking about this kind of thing a lot. You definitely think about this similarly as I, especially with the plan being to get paid to develop, and than dissolve the company so it become 'of the people.' Yes yes and yes! This is a new model to be excited about.
I think your idea has real potential and is in the right direction. I have a couple ideas myself I've pitched around. I thought I'd share:
To my eyes the next big thing after OpenBaazar could be a Uber or Airbnb type app. (an ENORMOUS project, yes). Uber, while it eliminates the barrier of entry for people (which is great) also creates a vast powerful hierarchical structure. THE TAXI COMPANY. Which seems like a great opportunity. Mimic them, and create the taxi company of the people. Bitcoin payments, distributed app, proof of existence and blockchain tracked rating system. A cheap tool becomes a free tool. Everyone switches over. Drivers get paid what they are worth, and experience no exploitation of labor. It becomes a tool, like a pencil. Sounds like the future to me. 
Another idea might be doing something like what Puddle.com is doing. Borrower centered crowd-based lending using Bitcoin and proof of  existence instead of Paypal and Facebook. (What they are doing is amazing, it just sucks that they have to use Paypal and Facebook until we build it with our new superior tools)
I'd love to hear your thoughts on these ideas. Best of luck on this new phase in your life! If you are in the Bay Area, I'd love to buy you coffee.
