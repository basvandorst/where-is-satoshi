Interesting, but estimating confirmation time in minutes instead of blocks elapsed is a bad idea IMO, you can't predict mining luck (or absence of luck).

p2sh or pay to script hash is a bitcoin transaction type allowing for complex transactions such as multisignatures. See [here]( for more information.

In France, we have [« la maison du Bitcoin »](
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:26:18
Currently Bitcoin does not support more than 3 signatures in a multisig script , see : [BIP 11](
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:13:36
And there's also wallet services like GreenAddress.it and Copay.io that greatly increase p2sh and multisig use.
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:30:52
For those who don’t know what a p2sh address is, here’s a real nice explanation from [original here](

Creator of [p2sh.info]( here, I have the numbers you are looking for (and they’ll be included on a v2 version of the website that’s in developement).
For the month of October 2014.
* Number of transactions per second : 0.89
* Number of outputs per second : 2.79
* Number of inputs per second : 2,51

55-60% of transactions don't use the old default fee policy of 10k sat/kB anymore, and it has been growing in the last few months.

For a very long time, people thought the Internet was just a fad/useless. We don't need to prove to anyone that it works just like you don't need to prove the Internet works.
@_date: 2016-06-15 08:32:45
3 decimal places is way overkill for this kind of estimations. There's not a *huge* difference in confirmation time between 40 and 50 sat/B.

Not true, the Bank of England is a public organisation for example.

I am not convinced that the market (as in people owning, using and trading bitcoins) took an explicit position on the blocksize debate. &gt;90% of users follow whatever the reference implementation is and it happens to be Core.
Node operators (!= market unfortunately) are following Core though.

Hence the for now. Plus, from now on, softforks will use BIP-9 signalling.


Sorry missed that one. But in any case, if people really want to put stuff in the blockchain, coinbase inputs and OP_RETURN are way better than bogus addresses.

You can see an aggregation of most public fee estimation [here]( with estimates for 1, 3 and 6 blocks.

Using the Blockchain wallet over TOR will redirect you to the .onion website since it provides way better security for TOR users.

The bank may have done the right thing in questioning the origin of the payment, but completely fucked up when keeping his money for 2 more months after he sent them the proof of its origin.

What's the difference between a 2MB HF (as in current block size cap that'll disappear with Segwit) and a "2 MB of current witness-included-in-txid (anyone-can-malleate) transactions" HF? There must be one since you make it but I don't see it. Care to explain?
@_date: 2016-06-09 15:29:49


Indeed, and I never said that. The issue is that it is very hard to "vote with your feet" due to network effects.
By nature, Bitcoin requires consensus ; the market can't be fundamentally split between competing and incompatible implementations like it can be with Chrome/Firefox/etc.. for browsers.
If a part of the market uses software that changes consensus rules, it is not part of the market anymore. Therefore the market will always follow the reference implementation.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:32:05
Should be fixed now.
@_date: 2016-06-09 20:04:40


The market should decide, but I don't think it did so. It chose the "don't care" option. 
It'd be better that every time there's a proposal for a new improvement, an opposite version is also be created. Then we'll see what is the market's position. Core shouldn't be the anti-BIP109 or anti-XThin choice. It should be the consensus.
As Slush's polls showed, most people (even miners!) either don't care/don't vote.
@_date: 2016-06-04 18:05:39


I don't see where you read that from the tweet. Segwit will be available sometime this year hopefully.
The main issue is that a lot of code has to be changed for it to be widely used, much more than for P2SH IMO. For example, nor BitcoinJS and BitcoinJ latest releases fully support segwit yet.

You may want to read the fine lines before making such claims.  and

0.00012430 BTC is exactly 55 satoshis per byte for a 226B transaction (most common size)

Block version 536870914 is 0x20000002 in hexadecimal which is what SegWit supporting blocks will advertise after the next retarget.

Block version 536870914 is 0x20000002 hexadecimal, which is what signals SegWit support.

Block versions didn't use to have to be interpreted in hex to make sense for most of Bitcoin's history (was 1, then 2, 3 and 4).

Coinbase has way more BTC than that, same for Xapo.

1. You still have legal recourses depending on your country. Stealing goods and money (even bitcoins) is illegal. You can use escrow services to reduce these risks
2. You can't be 100% sure an unconfirmed transaction will confirm. Depending on the goods' value, you can decide to take the risk and accept 0-conf transactions or wait for one or more transactions.
3. Excluding major security issues and cryptographic primitives compromission, Bitcoin can run as is indefinitely as long as there is nodes. As for the code updates, it's described [here](
4. Miners receive more than $1.5M a day in new bitcoins [source]( If this incentive wasn't enough to keep them mining, the network would face very long confirmation times for less than 2016 blocks and then continue when mining difficulty adjusts. However, if any miner was to put their equipement back online, they'd control more than 50% of the network and would be able to cause major disruption. But all of this is **highly** implausible. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 17:21:03
They totally miss the point of Bitcoin by associating it with the current banking system. Sure, a fiat cashless society is alienating, but a crypto based society is empowering.

You should also measure bytes/s since that's the hard limit (1MB/10min).
@_date: 2016-05-08 20:49:20
2: In the great majority of cases, waiting a few seconds and seeing the transaction appear on an external source is enough as it means it propagated through the network. You still have to watch out for RBF (replace by fee) transactions but they use a special flag. Using a payment processor (BitPay, etc...) will shield you from double spends as they take the risks but will cost you a small fee.
4: There's [~10 big mining pools]( some of them composed of hundred of individuals (AntPool, slush, ...) , others being a single company (BitFury).

You are speaking of adresses, wallets are sets of adresses. You should maybe focus on more specificly chosen adresses than just random ones in order to make structures visibles. Even with 100k random adresses, I doubt you will find something else than a very sparce graph.
