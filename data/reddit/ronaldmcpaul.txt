Thanks! Just reviewing his profile I see a lot of mentions of delis, could be foreign born Jew... I feel like I'm floundering a little bit right. Haha

Really? It makes more sense to me to get diagnosed by a psychologist.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:01:15
HOORAY!! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 23:27:46
I think you guys mean *psychologist.*

hmmm his/her without checking profile:
*One could imagine him/her being from* Sweden/Norway/Denmark/Holland --&amp;gt; *and he/she could have* learned German before learning English. I understand that it's usually a choice for students in those areas (but English is usually the defacto second language to learn anywhere in the world), so he/she is probably from a region with two 'native languages.' Also an area that emphasizes higher education (enough so that getting a math degree wouldn't be too terribly uncommon).
Maybe from Hong Kong or a region of China and learned Mandarin before English. But those are more like dialects...He/she said "math" and not "maths" which can suggest being from area of British English/influence however is currently in DC.
I'd put my money on India or Sri Lanka or Malaysia or Indonesia,  places which for starters have a lot of people, which helps my odds, but again have a 2nd language that makes more sense to learn than English out of necessity.

One possible weakness:
The speaker says that you have to start with a commodity. Bitcoins make up a system of digital accounting and a transfer protocol. This makes it a commodity, no?
@_date: 2012-07-08 22:18:06
Awesome, I was just trying to find out about this.

Interesting. Do you think that, that applies here in that that author does not support his claims?
@_date: 2012-07-01 05:05:14
Yes, perhaps better to stay away. I don't think anyone hates Bitcoin in there...just a lot of economics nerds. :)

That was my thought! I x-posted to r/anarcho-capitalism and there is a [pretty good discussion going on their now](
Basically, there may be a minor commodity qualification for bitcoin [see: "Unique Use-Value?"](

Don't get me wrong, I love buying and using Bitcoins but they always go to this black box that is never reflected in my financial aps.

I'm no expert, but alternatively, they may just be acting proactively because they know that lump sum transactions of that size may alert the attention of the feds. I'm curious if the bankers made any more mention of why they were asking.
In any case, props to OP for not disclosing anything before getting a chance to gather more information.

Hey, my intrigued friend hasn't used bitcoins and wants to know if she can get breakfast tacos in Austin. Know of a hot spot? Food is a great way to spread currency Methinks :-)

Dear Winklevoss twins,
You're doing bitcoin wrong.
@_date: 2013-01-10 10:47:55
Interesting. So an e-wallet could be automatic.

Too bad it's basically pointless to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-06-03 22:59:31
Also if the price happens to suddenly drop after your unsolicited financial advice, there will be a lot of angry Turks who hate Bitcoin, and you.
