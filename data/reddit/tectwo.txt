Electrum is apparently the wallet of choice around here. I'm about to move my BTC to it. Gotta do some practices of recovering it from the master key before I transfer it all over.

I use Gemini and it never reached 17K.

If you did anything by bank transfer, it has to clear. My deposit that I made last Tuesday cleared yesterday, almost a full week. Usually it advises that it could take up to 5 working days.

I'm new, 3 weeks, and I notice that there are a lot of people asking why their transactions haven't been confirmed, or for the skinny on Segwit. Being supportive is nice and all but we shouldn't be enabling repetitive, easily researched posts.
A rule on asking why transactions aren't being confirmed, if only temporary, would be welcome, I believe.

What people will pay is what it's worth, though, no?

It's already falling now, -$300 in 24 hours. Keep watching and buy when it starts going up again ASAP. I bought for the first time last week so take my advice lightly lol.

Oh, that's where I went wrong :(

Gemini is going into maintenance tomorrow, I'm scared I'll miss the lowest point!

Good advice, I put $1000 in 2 weeks ago. I'm not buying anymore for a few weeks. But I still like to imagine what I could be earning if I did buy more... or do I regret that? Maybe I'll buy more.

Just think how much you'll have in 10 years when BTC is at $200,000.

$4652 on my alerts and as soon as I check, it's already back up to $4731. I'm not buying any but it's still making me nervous!!
