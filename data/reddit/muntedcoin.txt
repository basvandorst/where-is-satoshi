And I mean that more as a general thing that applies to everyone.  Bitcoin needs each and every one of us to put our time, energy, and brain power into furthering the cause.

As you said, you can just check the blockchain to confirm the money is there.  You can list the addresses on your offline machine to make sure it's right.
Otherwise, if you really just want to "see" a balance there, create a watch-only wallet.  Go to Wallet -&gt; Master Public Key.  Use that MPK to create a watch-only wallet on your online machine.  It's safe as it doesn't have any ability to generate the private keys.

Yes, exchange some of your other currency into bitcoins.  AKA buying them.

It's going to be up to the savvyness of the consumer.  Now that the community have suffered many losses from third parties (the most significant obviously being Mt Gox), the golden rule of "if you don't own the keys, you don't own any bitcoin" is firmly planted in peoples minds.  And luckily we don't have to suffer the inconveniences of "stuffing cash under your mattress" - we actually have perfectly secure and convenient viable options that allow us to be our own bank.
Hopefully people don't forget this too quickly and start becoming complacent again.

I think a really killer app would be anything that allows users to *earn* bitcoins.  People spend hours visiting faucets just to make a few Satoshis.. imagine how crazy they would go for something where they could actually earn a living from it.  I'm thinking about stuff like uber, peer to peer renting, airtasker etc.
It's not quite an answer to your question, but just throwing it out there.

I suggest you try coinbase for your first experience.   It will take a while for you to get verified, but at least they're reliable and then you'll own some Bitcoin and your journey will begin.

10 minutes to get into a block.
If a father is sending $100 overseas to his kid back home, I don't think the kid has to worry about their own dad trying to double spend agains them.  Hopefully you get what I am trying to say.
They can immediately start to spend the money (yes, transactions with an unconfirmed parent will still relay and work fine).

If you think $500 per coin is too high, then definitely don't get into mining.  It will cost you more than $500 per coin to mine them.

Regarding 'what are bitcoins' - in reality, the only tangible thing that exists in the Bitcoin system is the Blockchain.  The blockchain is essentially a database (currently 20GB in size, stored on the computer of anyone who runs a Bitcoin full node) which tells everyone the balances of each address.  So, if someone sends you 0.1 bitcoins, really what happened was that a record was added to the database, deducting 0.1 from their address and adding 0.1 to yours.  This is a simplified explanation of course.
For your 2nd question - there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.  The idea of fractional reserve banking is that some institution may allow people to deposit bitcoins to them, and then promise them back (exactly like a bank takes your money, and promises that you'll be able to withdraw it whenever you want from an ATM).  There is nothing stopping a company from overpromising for coins that they don't actually have, if users are silly enough to trust them.  So in a fractional reserve system, there might be more than 21 million coins that people believe they own, but in reality there can only ever be 21 million coins.  Fractional Reserve is not really such a problem in Bitcoin, because we've worked around it with technology that can prove a companys reserves.  The general principal in Bitcoin is that we remove the need for trust.  If something can be proven mathematically, we don't need to trust someone's word.

Because if you could generate an address collision, bitcoin would be entirely insecure.  It's like asking, why couldn't someone guess your private key and steal your money?  If you really believe miracles can happen, then turn on your CPU and start trying to mine blocks.. at 20 Mhash you'd have 20 million chances per second of finding 25 BTC!  Only thing is, the maths says it will take you over 10 million years on average to find a block.
Well guess what?  It would take you ~10^21 times longer to generate a collision with a blockchain address.  So you'll sooner mine all bitcoins in existence with your CPU than find a collision.
Re drawbacks of electrum - the main thing is privacy.  The server you connect to will know your IP address and which bitcoin addresses you are interested in, plus they will know all transactions you send.  Not a big deal if you're not worried about spying, or you trust the server operator.

No one can possibly be as dumb as GHash.

That is true.  A malleability attack could mean a different txid gets confirmed, making the child tx invalid.  Some sources of malleability have been patched, but not all.  However, in practice there are not any widespread malleability attacks happening.

edit: That fee is fine, but the reason it isn't confirming is probably because you have a dust output (1 satoshi) which bitcoin core will reject.
You need to learn more about the blockchain.  There's no "limbo".  Money is either spent or unspent.  In this case, your money is still unspent.  The thing stopping you from spending it again is your wallet software which prevents you from attempting a double spend, and also the software ran by your peers will store your first tx in their mempool and won't relay any attempted double spend.  You just need to wait for it to fade from their mempools if you want to attempt another spend, or get a mining pool to include a 2nd tx in a block.

For any bitcoin I spend, I buy back double that amount.  That's just how I roll.
@_date: 2014-08-08 22:10:44
And privacy.  I imagine that some people might want to be private about their weird fetishes, so with Bitcoin, since it is trustless, they don't have to hand over their name, just the money.

If the max block size is limited, then miners would prioritise by fee-per-kilobyte.
But I do hope that the change would still allow miners to still have a minimum fee policy of their choice.

Use a CoinJoin-based mixer.  Dark Wallet will provide a trustless mixer (no trusting third parties to return your money, since it's all done decentralized and on the blockchain).
Blockchain.info also have a mixer, sharedcoin.com, but I've heard the implementation isn't very good so doesn't really protect privacy much.

Pretty much.  But they're not actually broadcasting "instructions" per se.  They're broadcasting this "Invertible Bloom Lookup Table" which is a crazy-ass data structure that seems capable of allowing two parties to determine the difference between two sets, using only enough space to hold the differences, even though those differences aren't known to either party.
So, imagine that you and I each had our own list of 1 million hashes.  We know that our lists are mostly the same, but there may be up to 10 differences (eg. you could have some hashes that I don't, or I could have ones you don't).  However, we don't know what those differences are.
I want to somehow communicate to you the full contents of my list.  In this case, I create this IBLT structure, which is roughly the size of 10 hashes, then send it to you, and you can use that data to magically work out the differences, and re-build my list.
