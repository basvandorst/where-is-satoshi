If Roger Ver came out and spent one of Satoshi's Bitcoins, would you move your support to Bcash?  I probably would, I might even stop calling it Bcash.

I say launch a bunch of bitcoins into orbit and "lose" them.  Someday cleaning up orbital junk will be like mining.

Yea, my 2nd job is kind of freaking out because they don't have any work for me.  I should be worried, but my little slice of magic internet money is making me complacent.

Congrats man.  With gains like that I'd sell it all, but you have some balls hodling.  I hope it keeps going up and you become a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:33:28
Yea, I'd be freaking out if I were you though.  Do you have a gun?
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:13:58
to make it tank further so they could make a cheap buy?  (New at this, sorry)

What about confirmation time?  I know DASH has a good solution, but bitcoin isn't the most reliable at that kind of thing?
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:12:59
That was always the main part of my plan if I ever got money.  I'd get a big place and turn it into a hangout for people like me.  Like a giant workshop full of tools and cnc machines, a hackerspace to end all hackerspaces...

Ffs... The family I know that had this happen is full of the strongest people I know.  I don't know if you have to be strong to survive it, or if it makes you that way, but damn, I don't think I'd have survived.
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:56:19
Hey presto, bitcoin survives again.
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:27:36
Super modern for sure, and even if they chip you can fix them.  They're taking a lot of our business lately.  Did Dave Chappelle's house in translucent granite with underlighting.  Cool as hell.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:20:32
Have any of them ever been real?  Are there any good examples of people finding massive bitcoin caches they lost years ago?
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:24:52
What's it like?
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:49:38
I was, thanx.  Good luck!
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:03:50
This sounds like bait to bring more people into the thread.  It's sure working on me.

Mexican cartel checks out.  I know a family that was in witness protection.  They talked about shootouts on the freeway and attempted breakins all the time.  I always thought it was BS for years, but they have some newspapers framed that tell enough of the story that I'm pretty sure most of it happened.  I don't know how people live like that. (all parties are out in the open now, not breaking any trust mentioning it in an obscure way.)
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:39:46
Oh, I didn't mean it like that...  I'm just here for the ride.  Shit like this is what I fantasize about.  Just... winning in a rigged game, it's the stuff dreams are made of.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:48:00
Why would people buy if someone suddenly had millions in bitcoin?  Wouldn't you just sell if you believed somebody was about to dump?
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:34:53
Love 3d printing.  The point would be to have a whole ton of people use the stuff too.  Teach me what they know and make cool shit.  That's the life.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:10:49
How many?  Still just the 60?
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:46:34
Well shit
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:19:41
They chip, read consumer reports.  Way too much maintenance.
@_date: 2017-10-20 10:06:39
I understood the technology and knew about the process behind creating them, but I didn't get the economic side of them (still don't tbh).  Bought some coin once or twice, but only exactly enough to buy something.  Now hodling, but I won't pretend I know why.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:55:50
Followed for followup post.  Don't let me down, I'm hooked.
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:07:30
Newbie here, I think buying now is a bet that the fork is going to fall through in some way.  The expectation is that it will go down if the fork goes through and go up if the fork is abandoned.

Hit me up if you need granite countertops, can get you a deal.  There's no better time to start thinking about your dream kitchen.
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:36:42
That was pretty much what I was doing I think, but it's good to know it's not a totally sub-optimal strategy.
@_date: 2017-10-18 03:29:23
Yea, I'm not telling anyone that I've picked up a bitcoin habit (first purchase yesterday).  Bought a fuckton of darkcoin a few years back, but just used it to pay for a VPN and didn't hodl any.  The regret is real.  Now I'm going into work early and staying late so I can earn enough to buy a whole bitcoin before it goes where I can't follow.
