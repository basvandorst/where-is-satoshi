But how do you avoid scams and chargebacks on p2p system such as localbitcoins? You sell bitcoins and then person says to his bank/paypal oooowie someone hacked my account and bought bitcoin with it.  This is what keeps me from using p2p. Don't know if im paranoid.
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:28:57
Pretty crap article tbh. You assume every country will ban bitcoin (no idea why u talk only about it, instead of crypto as a whole). Thats like insane assumption. Seems like you are just fishing for clicks.
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:09:20
Yep. He said sellers reasoning was he is from us and cant trade on bitifinex. Normal guy would go to other exchange. Something is really shady. If under market value means 20% off, then its obvious its money laundering.

I wouldn't recommend putting life assets into crypto. Only put as much as you can afford to  lose. Anyways they are swamped, it will be resolved eventually.

@_date: 2017-12-28 12:13:11
He was obsessed with checking his balance as he said, so I guess he had them on his phone or whatever. Logically this checks out if the story is in fact true.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:34:28
Wait, bitstamp got back at you so quickly? My verification is still pending :) Also kraken will get an upgrade soon.

I'm actually sorry that you can;t trust your family.
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:26:48
Sure, but the pairs op given as clues might not be in seed. Who knows. There are a lot of bip39 words in that picture.
@_date: 2018-05-31 07:14:49


the clue is 00212121 not 212020
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:36:42
You need to be pretty dumb if you take that 50k bet with coef 1.5x. Buying bitcoin itself would make it 6x at this moment.
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:00:02
Yeah story.. It's like writing a poem that someone else wrote. Where is the puzzle part. If he connects words, because they sound nice together and tell a story, it's gonna be just a guessing game. So far I wasn't able to connect almost anything that I could say yep that's a pair 100%.  I could open 1000's of wallets that's not hard. Pick 23 words from picture , run script to give option for last one, if any valid words are in the picture, you take it and  open it. That's just bruteforcing.
@_date: 2018-05-24 22:54:10
Is it broken english or you figured that sentence out from the picture. Are you saying that pairs point to other stuff and are not part of seed?
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:42:25
Yeah, I have all special things colored (years, z=... and such) single letters. Some things do catch an eye. Like  3 out of 8 items in bibliography are referenced to twice while the other 5 only once. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 02:33:46
Guess not
@_date: 2018-05-23 00:31:20
I was making the point it is pointless to brag about opening 10 wallets, cause you can brute force valid mnemonics all day long, but that flew right over your head.
@_date: 2018-05-11 20:12:42
When the the kind of quantum tech comes that cant brute force things, the counter measures come. I don't work on bitcoin so i cant tell what they are looking at. Current quantum computers are not capable of that, current quantum computers are used more on optimization problems and dont beat regular pcs at everything.
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:41:21
Is this phrase in the picture?
@_date: 2018-05-31 08:33:52
It's not a viable path, since it is solvable with paper version too. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:04:47
What about lambda, just interesting or op gave clue referring to it?
@_date: 2018-05-20 22:08:57
settle for 50% of the prize. Boy you are funny.
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:41:37
I bet op just thought of a poem from mnemonic words that rhymes for him and now we have to guess it. Not much of a puzzle. The more I look at it the more I think it's some random thing like that and not actually a puzzle.
@_date: 2018-05-22 15:28:38
so is everything else. he marked it as a clue, thats why im asking
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:43:06
Don't be silly.  Quantum counter-measures. It's not like only one side of technology is evolving. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 23:00:18


I stopped on this question, its not yes/no question. I fill out them to help out, but get really pissed off when you waste time. If this was undergrad i would be more lenient, but its for masters? Haha

public key = (private key) * G
It cant be eliptic curve. If you needed to solve it you would need to know private key(yay) or public key(doubt it).  And finally pick correct value of G.

Can you tell us how you got the virus? Cautionary tale for others.
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:52:18
Regarding "Strange word hes on the top left corner of the Bitcoin logo". It's evident that OP removed special characters before making cloud word. So "hes" is simply "he's".
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:45:31
Let me tell you this way. Don't you think if he removed a password then there is no point to finding it? There is nothing after you find seed + password, because it would be pointless to remove password if it was still needed for something else.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:54:06
Yeah, no chill this time. The n-th survey that broke camels back.

How you went from here to there?
@_date: 2018-05-22 07:42:26
It's not reversed there is 257 in source which OP used   and puzzled is not hacked, funds are still available. You reason that you removed the characters, but still think hes is strange word (written in your article), go figure.
@_date: 2018-05-11 19:51:14
It doesn't confirm anything though. You can inspect an element and change the text before taking screenshot. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:19:08
Well you described pretty much what the heard thinks and I myself thought about same things too. But nobody cracked it yet.  I'm also trying to derive clues from picture to see how OP thinks.   
For example "Think in pairs", haven't seen anything that would even indicate that. I see word "Pair" at top left, but it's just there I couldn't connect it with "Think in pairs". 
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:18:38
Interesting choice, I have no luck with "Lost trancation cost almost users", makes no sense at all. Got any ideas on this one?
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:34:01
He sent cents to the puzzle fund and got change back into his wallet (but different address), it's a single transaction. That's how it works.

You are calling bitcoin as  bitcoin core in this picture. Only bcash puppets call it that way. So no wonder it is received negatively and why even bitcoin portrayed as shitty van?

It creates new address for every new transactions and they are reusable. Same private key has tons of different addresses. I think misconception that private key is a key of single address is what cost him.

All you did is post link to youtube video. That's just claiming ad revenue from someone elses work. Thats fine though, since your websites community might find it when otherwise they would not, BUT when you link something at reddit, link the source.

Its not an exchange. If everyone would be allowed to bet on 1 btc it would be another exchange.

Getting half is more than fair. He would have 0 since he was sitting on his side of clues for long time without going anywhere. It was his decision to share his clues.

Oh yes. Half of a bitcoin, not half. Should have received half.

@_date: 2013-04-09 14:42:46
Invest only if you can allow yourself to lose everything. High risk, high profit. Since bitcoins are skyrocketing I am sure it will attract some unnecessary attention.
