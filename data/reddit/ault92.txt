I'm starting to think it might be partly due to people cashing out from Nicehash through Coinbase/GDAX.
Especially as it dropped quite a bit on GDAX at about daily payout time.

Segwit is more like 1.6-1.7x, but the Segwit2x agreement involved a doubling of block size also.
Personally, I have all my bitcoins on a Segwit address though.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:39:24
It's because my BTC are currently in Armory, and over time this has decided to use multiple addresses (each time I made a transaction it seems it cycled the btc to a new address).
This means that the transaction of all my BTC to the new ledger address has 8 inputs, making it stupidly expensive.

Sorry, mining altcoins and exchanging for BTC, previously via Nicehash, now via MiningPoolHub.

As I mentioned elsewhere on the thread, my native rule was too far down the list so was superceded by an "any" rule and my node wasn't listening. I've changed this now.
I don't see how it is expensive though, it's 160gb of HDD space (that's as much as a scrap HDD from my drawer would hold) and worst case, from what others are saying, 250gb of bandwidth (costs me nothing).

The NN stuff is an American thing and I'm afraid you are one country, not the world ;) it might of course make it harder for Americans to run full nodes.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:09:05
Is it? 8mb blocks (which BCH is not hitting) would be what, 410GB/year. My whole full node currently takes up 160GB.
At that rate, I would be running a full node at home for at least the next 10 years, assuming no HDDs added to my machine, and I would expect that by that time HDD space will have come down in cost.
Anyone that wants to run a full node, with 8mb blocks, can buy 10 years worth of block storage space for $75:
Yeah, my gran probably isn't going to run one, but I think I would rather pay $75 once per 10 yeaes than $40 per transaction.
I'm not saying Segwit is bad or LN is bad... but why not all three? And certainly block size increases could help in the time we're waiting for LN.

UK here, I did just try to sign up but it's asking me for way more info than I'm happy to give - e.g. profession, passport and passport number, etc.
With all this KYC/AML I might as well just use fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:59:36
Yeah, I guess that makes some sense, you must be running some relatively major node I guess? I mean, I wouldn't even know how to increase my node's bandwidth usage 50 times from it's current 5GB a month as per the image I added to the above post.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:13:31
I have a similar issue, seemingly because armory likes to use different recieving addresses every time and each time I send some coin somewhere, send the rest of the contents of that address to a new one?
I now have coin in like 7 different addresses (on one wallet) and it's completely prohibitive to move it to my ledger nano s.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:13:29
34GB is 410GB divided by 12, or the monthly figure that would be taken up to download 8mb blocks. The figure you were saying "holy shit" to.
If you are downloading a full copy of the chain, it's currently 160GB.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:11:16
I have one of these as of today, the issue is that I don't want to pay the $140 transaction fee to move my BTC to it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:11:27
So, my current usage of 5GB up and down is an average of 15kbps - i.e. less than 1/3rd of a 56k modem can deliver.
Your usage of 250GB/month, is effectively 761kbps or 0.76mbit all month.
Even if we hit 8x that (which would be 56tx/second, or about half as many tx as paypal currently handle) my usage would go to 120kbps (less than an ISDN2 line) and yours would go to 6.088mbit (which seems a lot, but I would still run a full node even with that).
56tx/second still isn't much though, for bitcoin to truly take off, we need larger blocks as well as segwit, LN, etc. I don't believe any one of those is enough.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:57:52
If your ISP isn't happy with 34GB/month, then you are on quite a limited plan I guess, I mean, that's only ~15.5 hours of 1080p netflix a month, or about 30 mins a day.
I think it's likely there are more people able to run a full node at 410GB/year or 34GB/month than there are that have the BTC to be able to afford to have a load of LN channels open with different people, or be able to run an LN hub...
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:54:11
Ah, I'm in fact an idiot, my NAT rule was too far down the list and below the "catch all" entry I was using for something else, so inbound traffic was not reaching my full node.
As such I'm an idiot, but on the plus side, this conversation made me check so was worthwhile :) I will wait and see how much bandwidth it uses!
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:33:06
I mean, I guess instead of fractional reserve fiat with nothing backing it, or a gold standard, you could have a bitcoin standard?
That is, all fiat is backed by a certain amount of treasury held btc?
I guess that the detractors would argue that's what lightning will end up being...
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:21:24
I'm running core, I have incoming connections allowed in the settings, and I have set a NAT rule for port 8333 on my firewall.
Am I missing something? This guide would suggest not:
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:36:05
True, but that's kind of to be expected. The only reason bitcoin is the most successful crypto is that it's the first crypto. Others do things better, be it faster confirmations, less ASIC friendly algos, smart contracts, etc.
BCH is a clone of bitcoin that throws away the only strength of bitcoin.
I do think that if you say, increased btc to 4mb blocks with segwit, it would be such a significant increase in capacity that even BTC would not be hitting it for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:19:58
It's not that simple though is it?
Paper wallet does not allow you to use an exchange. Miners are trapped with coins in online pool wallets due to minimum payouts and high transaction fees, etc.
Personally, I had about 0.08BTC mined in my NH wallet, waiting for 0.15BTC to payout to minimise fees.
If they are gone, that's £750 or so. I obviously have the rest of my BTC in a safer place, where I control the keys, but that's still not a small loss.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:34:29
34GB a month is a lot of bandwidth?
That's 15 hours of netflix 1080p streaming a month. It's nothing.
And that assumes full size 8mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:43:35
I've sent it with 61sat/b on a punt. If it gets there in a couple of weeks, great.
In the meantime I am playing with LTC and ETH on my Ledger. I hope there is eventually a solution for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:05:39
We have pretty decent competition here in the UK, I can choose from probably 50+ unlimited ISPs, but yes I guess your ability to run a node does depend on an unlimited data plan.
Of course, even the bitcoin blockchain is growing by 5gb/month, so will still have issues on that logic I guess?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:34:37
There seem to be quite a few ways to reduce the bandwidth or HDD use (or both)
Like yourself I work in IT, and have an unlimited cable connection in the UK (400/22). As for you, "wife acceptance factor" is a strong influence on what I do IT wise at home. It sounds more like you need to cap the bandwidth use of bitcoin-core or limit the total number of connections, perhaps with QoS at the router?
I now have a second node running in a datacentre on a 1gbit link (a work server), but I'm not yet feeling any impact from my home node.
Even if we don't go to 8mb, then the "2x" part of Segwit2x should be happening, but seems to have vanished.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:26:04
I wonder how long the network would take just to get through all the transactions from everyone sending their BTC from their legacy wallets to their new Segwit wallets...
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:31:25
For my part I have UPNP off as I consider it a security risk, I was looking at inbound 8333 for my node (which is what I have the NAT rule allowing).
As I mentioned in that post, the total bandwidth that I can't account for from one application (Sabnzbd) is only 140 ish GB this month, and I've watched a lot of Plex remotely, and the Sabnzbd bandwidth is only for the last 25 days.
But yes, I can see that it would use an amount more than the raw block size would suggest. 50x seems high to me? But I guess I'm no expert!
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:50:02
That doesn't make much sense, the entire chain is 160GB, so for some reason you are uploading the whole chain somewhere 1.5x a month?
If each block is 1mbyte, and there is 1 block per 10 mins, then there are 6 * 24 * 30 = 4320MB of new blocks a month. Where are you getting 250GB from?!
My home server that runs my node used, according to my firewall, used 325GB up *and* down in November, but that includes running Plex, Sonarr, Deluge, Sabnzbd, etc.
Sabnzbd alone is up to 318GB this month, and there has been 464GB of traffic from that server in the last 30 days (I can't interrogate Sab for last 30d or firewall for december until december is over) so that only leaves 146GB of other usage (probably mostly torrents) that could POSSIBLY be apportioned to the BTC node.
EDIT: Port 8333 (which should be bitcoin node traffic) has used 5GB in the last month.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:42:04
So, I mined (from about July) to address A in armory.
Since then, I have bought a few things (mostly GPUs for more mining) and it seems each time I send BTC it sends the contents of A to two addresses, the merchant and B, B being another address in the Armory wallet. Each transaction used a new "B".
This has happened several times, and I now have BTC in 7 addresses in the same armory wallet.
My new Ledger wallet is Segwit, but I don't think the armory ones are (they start with 1).
Moving the BTC to my new wallet is therefore a ~1500byte transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:42:05
Supposedly LN and Segwit solve everything long term, but LN is not ready, so we need a short term solution. Increasing the block size sounds ideal then!
@_date: 2018-06-03 23:18:55
Thanks I guess. As I said I did manage to make the payment in the end. I get some of your logic, people being inept and sending bch to a btc address etc must cause issues, but I wish there was some sort of advanced mode where it just gave me an address to send to, as I have done many times before.
It doesn't help that this change isn't that well communicated. I got to the final screen with the QR code and was looking for the link that used to be there to send the payment manually.
I then plugged a webcam in that I had to dig out of the loft to try to scan the QR code into the ledger app (obviously that didn't work), before copying the link into notepad hoping I would find a wallet address.
It all became a massive saga, and I now know I hate electrum, but I feel like there was more chance of me messing up and losing coins going through this process of juggling wallets than there was on the old process.
@_date: 2018-06-04 07:37:33
I get your point, I do, but show me another computer parts retailer in the UK I can use bitcoin with that uses another payment processor.
OcUK don't even take bitcoin anymore, Scan insist on Bitpay, Aria insist on Bitpay, end of list.
@_date: 2018-06-04 05:34:48
Thanks, you are amazing!!!!
@_date: 2018-06-03 22:23:46
I'm not. I'm using a ledger nano s as a wallet. I was using the ledger app to manage it but to pay the retailer via bitpay I now need to use a bip70 wallet because arbitrary reasons.
Two of these are electrum and mycelium. Electrum was not working properly on my main pc (15 mins+ freezes between actions) but I managed to make the payment from my ledger nano with electrum using my fiancée's laptop in the end.

You're not comparing apples to apples. That's a gross oversimplification. It's like saying a sailboat is faster than all the cars on the planet combined because none of them can go very fast on water.
You still wouldn't use a sailboat on the highway, just as humans can't do complex maths as fast as a pocket calculator.

Not that I'm stalking you (I'm totally stalking you) and I know this is probably the wrong place for suggestions, but a free trial (time limited, or limited to 1gb) would probably do wonders for you to spread word of mouth, let people get a small taste and run some pretty benchmarks...
