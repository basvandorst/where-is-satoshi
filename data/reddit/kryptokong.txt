This is fucking amazing. We are the new elite.

Interesting perspective, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:50:10
Congrats and yeah I wouldn't put it off based on reaching some arbitrary net worth, do it while you can. 
I've been thinking of doing the same for a while, but I've been putting it off because I don't have a GF at the moment, and I don't want to travel the world alone. Also, I don't want to just proposition some random girl, I'm paranoid that I will only be able to get gold diggers now...fuck.

They were pretty much against BTC before the split, pumping Ethereum for months and bashing BTC daily. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:28:38
Fuck that. I will literally give up citizenship and leave the U.S. if they institute some absurd tax rate on BTC owners.

Knowing absolutely nothing about Japan or real estate, what happened?

Once it becomes mainstream it will settle at an equilibrium price and fluctuate in a much tighter range than the volatility now. Look up the S-curve technological adoption graph. It looks the same as a bubble for the first part, but it doesn't crash, it stabilizes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:07:24
He is smoking some good, good logarthmic exponential S-curve adoption. In other words, see you at 100k in 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:49:30
Have you seen Going Clear? If we create enough hassle and legal trouble for the IRS we could probably pressure them into making BTC tax exempt. This is something serious, like if BTC goes to 10k, 50k, etc, we will have enough to try this if we wanted to

Step out of your liberal echo chamber and bathe in the glory of the god emperor.

Congrats dude :)

A lot of people keep their coins on exchanges thus not increasing the # of wallets. I have several friends who each have just a few hundred dollars worth of BTC but they keep it on coinbase. Actual number of users at this point is probably a lot higher.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:48:53
I don't see your point in any of these comments. BTC arguably already has more utility than gold, are you saying it is somehow going to go away? Even if Bitcoin stays exactly the same as it is right now, there will be increasing demand and a higher price. If it upgrades or improves, even better. If you are saying that Bitcoin has no use, then you are just a troll. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:45:53
I love what you are doing especially the focus on privacy. This is the best mobile wallet I've used.

He's just a megalomaniac and wants to be Satoshi 2.0. Its fucking pathetic
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:04:30
I just used it for purchasing gold, watches, and jewelry. For larger purchases the transaction fees don't matter because its such a small percent
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:09:02
What environmental impact is that? The only "waste" produced by Bitcoin mining is heat. This could probably even be captured and harvested in some useful way. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:34:31
We need to create the Church of Satoshi and demand tax exempt status ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:12:55
Some people are, some people aren't. I do both, I bought christmas presents with BTC this year, but I also just buy it to speculate/trade/invest in. Also, the darknet uses it for drugs and the online gambling industry is starting to use it for deposits/withdrawals
@_date: 2017-09-06 05:57:46
So? Why does it matter if they use Bitpay, this is still a way for BTC hodlers to spend their coins without having the hassle of converting to FIAT first.
@_date: 2017-09-30 15:07:46
If by crash you mean "drop a couple thousand than head to $10,000 a few weeks later" then yes.

They are buying oil with yuan, backed by gold. Yuan isnt going anywhere
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:41:48
Yes it does, lmfao. The fee is a percentage of the size of the order. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:11:41
Because the issuance is not controlled by governmemt or an entity, it is controlled by an algorithm and uncorruptible. No one is decreeing anything about BTC because no one entity controls it.
Whether it has intrinsic value or not is debatable, but it is definitely not FIAT
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:46:58
That's why I said government or entity. But its semantics, in reality it doesn't matter as government and central banks work hand in hand.

We are talking about a buy/sell on Bitfinex. Not a bitcoin transaction on the blockchain.

Dude, you clearly do not understand what fractional reserve banking is. It is literally how new money is created. That is part of the definition. Watch this video for a simple explanation:
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:00:48
You are correct, taxes only apply when selling. But buying goods with BTC with a Shift card is considered selling because you are "selling" the BTC for the goods. So for tax purposes buying something in a store with BTC is considered the same as selling that BTC for fiat on an exchange
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:25:04
I'm glad for you, but honestly when posts like this start popping up I start to think we are at the top of a bubble....only time will tell.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:11:10
Associating bitcoin with "antifa" commie protesters is not a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 06:50:52
90%+ of money is numbers in a computer. My whole point is that fractional reserve is a scam because most of that money doesn't actually exist. If just a small percentage of bank account holders want to withdraw their money, *the entire system collapses*


I FUCKING KNOW.
This is what I am trying to say, fractional reserve would never work with BTC because with BTC it is easily verifiable whether the bank actually has the coins, and you can see if they are just running a bucket shop where deposits are not 1:1
I may have calculated something in my example incorrectly, possibly why you are not getting it. Let me rewrite.
Person 1 has 10 BTC and deposits it into a bank with reserve ratio 10%.
Bank lends 9 BTC to Person 2.
Person 2 deposits 9 BTC into bank with 10% reserve ratio.
Bank lends 8.1 BTC to Person 3
Now Person 1 logs into their account and sees a balance of 10 BTC, Person 2 logs into their account and sees a balance of 9 BTC, person 3 logs into their account and sees a balance of 8.1 BTC. 
This works with fiat because they are just numbers on a scree, it doesn't work with BTC because Person 1 will see that his 10 BTC are not actually there, only 1
@_date: 2017-10-02 03:01:58
That's not fractional reserve banking then, that's a term deposit. 
Fractional reserve is when you deposit money into a normal checking/savings account and the bank loans it out while you still have access to it, essentially creating new money
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:40:27
What lol? The bid wall was dumped into to open a margin short.
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:55:03
Once you go down the rabbit hole you cannot come out. The truth cannot be unseen. Satoshi's prophecy is playing out 
@_date: 2017-10-02 00:51:46
Fractional reserve creates new money because the money the bank lends out is re-deposited into the banking system and re-lent. This creates money out of thin air, it wouldn't work with bitcoin.
Deposit 10 BTC
Bank lends 9 keeps 1 (10%)
Borrower deposits the 9 that they borrowed
Bank lends 8.1 and keeps .9 (10%)
That 10 BTC is now 18.1 BTC  in the banking system. There is now more debt than actual BTC. This is how most Fiat money is created, not through the fed buying treasury bonds. It doesn't work with BTC becuase you can't create BTC out of thin air.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:52:39
Dont even go down that road, seriously. Alts are essentially gambling
@_date: 2017-10-02 02:49:09
What happens if the depositor to Bank 1 wants to withdraw their 10 BTC and the depositor to bank 2 wants to withdraw their 9 BTC at the same time?
This is my point, the banks don't actually have more than 10 BTC yet fractional reserve has created more than 10 BTC in the accounts. This is why you cannot have fractional reserve with BTC.

I disagree with OP, the earlier the better. This technology is not going away and being exposed to it at a young age (even if he doesn't fully understand it) is a good thing.
