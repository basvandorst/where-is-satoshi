I really have much worse things to worry about atm. These people still have the power, everything is unstable because these people want it to bee unstable, it's not by chance, is by design. They know what they're doing, and yes, it's not in our interest only to theirs. So unless people will get our on the streets and do something, en mass, there's no use to think anything will change. It's still going according to their plan. In fact, crypt is playing into their hands and it's hilarious how you peeps can't see that. Crypto is THE way to a cashless society. Etc, etc. Don't worry, they will not lose.

 Try edging. Preventing yourself from cumming has a lot to do with a specific muscle (I forget the name of it) and if you edge you're essentially working that muscle out. Also male keagles are totally a thing (to an extent). You work that muscle out and you'll be lasting longer in no time. On top of that a lot of my buddies use what they call a "mental playlist" where you think of things that turn you off a little while you're going at it. Try it out dog.

Yes, well, I thought you were a bit brighter to conclude on your own that they don't plan such a big and obvious change from one dat to the next. They have to make it seem like a positive while it's really not. Etc etc. Come on people.

Do you every find yourself getting upset with yourself for not doing something, not because you actually WANT to do it but because it feels like it’s the right thing to do?
That is kind of vague. Lemme give you an example: me and my dad aren’t super close. He had an affair, it broke apart the family, blah blah you get it. But a lot of times I feel bad because of my apathy towards building a relationship with him. We’re fine now, but I have no real desire to be closer to him. But I always feel bad because I imagine how he must feel being emotionally removed from his children and I feel like the “right” thing to do is to just be a perfect daughter and be close with him. I feel more distress at my inability to do the “right” thing than I actually do at the situation.
Does this ring true for any 1’s? Or is this more of a 9 thing?

 There are loads of Tilapia farms in Indonesia so yea i think its strange they are using a lower value fish like carp when they could be getting extra profit from doubling as a fish farm. I'm sure there is some reason why they aren't but i have no idea what it could be. 
 I mean if you are a farmer and you do this you could easily have a small tilapia farm for this purpose, bring them to the rice paddies, have them shit all over the place and then eat the big ones, put the small ones back in their tank for the winter. I'm sure hes not just going to his local crick to pull out some goldfish

Very well. Using crypto to make profit is really the opposite of what bitcoin is supposed or claimed to be. Hey, I want to see it win but I'll incredibly sceptic if it overthrowing a system that has been hold strong for many years and has very very very influential people and means behind it. For anything to truly change we need much more than just a internet coin.
