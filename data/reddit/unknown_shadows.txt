Ok, cool, got it. If only there was a way to ensure the sender could no longer use it... Say an escrow until recipient has moved into their wallet. Just seems like theres an idea here to get around all the fee nonsense.

Yes I am looking into that. NY and BTC don't seem to like each other too much. If I have 75-100k to buy BTC and I do so via an individual - that does not automatically imply money laundering. I was just under the impression that there were more people / companies who could do this in a day or so. There is no way I could have my account and limit in any exchange to such a level I could do this by Monday.

Its in a bank now - the problem with exchanges is to get to this limit would take a month minimum. Maybe its just related to NY, but I have not found any exchange that would get you to this level in the next 30 days - never mind 3.

BTC ATM are generally $3000 per day, per phone+per id, if you are doing it in the maxes aka 1 transaction. Even doing the non-max, non-id route you are then at 799 per transaction and again 3000 a day.

Yes, BitLicense in NY causes a lot of expenses for "vendors", which trickles down to the buyers.

This is obviously showing naiviety on my part, but why would you not touch a 75k for less then $70 per BTC? Would you not just be making a killing?

Actually... there are 4 different BTC ATM providers in the tri-state area. I suppose one could do the max on each and be able to get around 12k in BTC a day getting you to the target in 5 days - still faster then getting any exchange to get you to the 75-150k limits. Granted youd be driving all day essentially and getting pulled over may involve some very interesting questions and answers ;)
