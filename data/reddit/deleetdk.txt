The author is comparing the wrong two scenarios. He is comparing pre-CC scenario:
1. Get paid in $
2. Buy stuff with $
With the transition to CC-economy scenario:
1. Get paid in $
2. Buy CC with $
3. Buy stuff with CC
Now, the second step above creates an additional price which is a problem. This he is right about. Some companies offer a discount when users use ฿ which helps get through the transition.
However, the future CC-economy scenario is this:
1. Get paid in CC
2. Buy stuff with CC
This scenario is clearly better than the first one. The middle one is just a transition scenario.

I don't have the relevant coding abilities (python only). I was complaining about the general phenomenon of programmers making stuff user-unfriendly. Command line there, 5 dependencies there, editing system variables, compiling, .... Average people just look at this and give up. Even advanced users often don't bother. If Bitcoin needs average and advanced people to mine to avoid 51% attacks, then user-friendly software must be made.
As another person below suggested. Make a prize pool for someone (or a group) to make this software available. If it is so important for Bitcoin, then bitcoin holders have some self-interest in putting money in it and so does Bitcoin organizations.

Knowing something about the escort market, bitcoin is very well suited for this thing. For two reasons: 1) No charge backs, 2) privacy/anonymity. The first happens when the partner of the buyer finds out and cancels the payment with the bank. For this reason, most escorts only take cash. The second is important because in some areas, the work is illegal to do or buy (e.g. Sweden, US). The anonymity protects against oppression from the state. As as added benefit, it also protects against snooping partners.
I predict for these reasons that bitcoin will be very popular among sex workers, even though that they are mostly women (women are less interested in technology). I will certainly try to help them set it up.

Clearly, having two different systems for possessives is not very smart. (Nouns and pronouns are both noun phrases, in linguistics). Other languages do not generally have two different ways to assign genitive /s/ in writing for nouns and pronouns.
In Danish, "he" is "han", genitive form is "hans". For nouns, to add genetive /s/ is just to add &lt;s&gt; in the spelling. E.g. &lt;Emil&gt;→&lt;Emils bil&gt; (Emil's car).

It's an old version of WAIS, german version. Since the highest score was 143, the ceiling cannot be less than that. But usually, the ceiling is not very high on standard tests. Perhaps 145 or 150. The ceiling for converting SAT to IQ is about 140-145. The ceiling for Advanced Raven's is 140.
It is possible to find out by acquiring the now very old instruction manuals for the text. They should have information about the ceiling.

Modafinil works less well the higher IQ of the person. This makes it not very useful for high-IQ people, which would be a lot of transhumanists.
Cf. Randall, Delia C., John M. Shneerson, and Sandra E. File. "Cognitive effects of modafinil in student volunteers may depend on IQ." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 82.1 (2005): 133-139.

It might work for those kind of situations. Presumably those tests on students were done with wakeful volunteers, not sleepy ones. If high-IQ sleepy people are like average-IQ wakeful people, then modafinil should work. In theory. Much more science needs to be done in this area.

Possibly. It is known that intelligence and Reaction Time measures (and the like) correlate much stronger in low scoring samples than high scoring samples. Perhaps it is due to some ceiling effect.
This can be avoided by using more sophisticated RT tests. E.g. increasing the difficulty of the odd man out tests by introducing more lights.
Etc. There is a paucity of research in this area!

Make a scalable liquid democracy system using the bitcoin protocol.

Presumably it belongs here since PPs are Bitcoin friendly. At least, Falkvinge promotes them and so do we (PPDK).
