Ayn Rand, is that you?

I'm impressed at how you so closely captured the Ayn Rand phrasing as well, unless Libertarians are really good at regurgitating Ayn Rand and you just are a good mimic of them.  (I wouldn't know; I just can't waste my time with the really retarded ones.)

Moot question.  An actual billionaire knows how to maximize their political influence using their money.  They'd give money to someone who's ideologically predisposed to taxation as long as that someone "made" them more money with favorable ~~tax holes~~legislation.

Plus, there are transactional losses once the wallets froze.

How does Walmart plan to do that outside of the US?  Do you really think Walmart is ubiquitous overseas?

That's because technology moves to fast to allow monopolies to exist in a damaging form for an extended period of time.  The last big "monopoly" that the DOJ pursued was Microsoft.  And it wasn't the DOJ that brought Microsoft "down to size"; technology (internet, search, mobile) made Microsoft's monopoly position in desktop computing irrelevant.
That's not to say that antitrust law is obsolete.  It was critical in keeping IBM from monopolizing the computer industry.  And the DOJ definitely broke up Ma Bell a decade before IBM.  They should apply antitrust law against the banking industry.  There's definitely cartel activity setting LIBOR rates.

Then *she* would have to figure out a way to exchange BTC for local currency, *in a foreign country* unfamiliar to her.
Apparently, he gave the BTC to a friend living in the same foreign country as the girlfriend.  The friend *knew* where he could get BTC exchanged, and then delivered the local cash to the girlfriend.
The bitcoin still helped, because it was the only way to quickly get money to her overseas.

OP said nothing about it in his original post.  But I was still able to figure out why he didn't send her the bitcoins directly, when you posed your question.

A strange country, like the US of A?

1)  You labor under the delusion that all economic problems can be fixed by application of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
2)  No, the accused company must be defined as a monopoly, in order to be subject to the provisions of the trustbusting legislation.
3)  Every example I've cited were actually being prosecuted by the DOJ.  Only Ma Bell got broken up.  But that happened in the 1970's, not ancient history.
