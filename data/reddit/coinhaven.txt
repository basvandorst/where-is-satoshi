The bitcoin foundation was viable because bitcoin value appreciated a lot. Back when it got donations they weren't worth much but over time the value appreciated.
It's just like how the forum has hundreds of thousands of dollars in funds that Theymos is now laundering through that "forum software development" front.
People are selfish. We've seen this with other open source projects as well. OpenSSL, GnuPGP, WordPress even. It's only when you have corporate backing that there is enough funding. Sponsored developers like the ones that work on the Linux kernel.

If it's too complicated then that's because you are messing around with private keys, redemption scripts and other low level shit. Let the computer handle all that for you. Use a multisig wallet like electrum.

You'd have to be a masochist to do it when you can just memorize the 12-13 word mnemonic to a deterministic wallet instead. Download electrum and get ready to be amazed!

9/10 times it's hard to buy because people go about it the wrong way. They think they can buy with CC/paypal because that's what they've been using for all their online shopping all these years. But bitcoin is new and the old ways won't work.
You are trying to buy from foreign sites. You should look for local sites and businesses in the phillipines. Look for other e-currencies and you'll find the people that deal in bitcoin too. If you still can't figure it out ask dabs on bitcointalk forum or ask in the thread for phillipines there:

If we are talking profits then its usually the smaller operations that are making profits. The largers VC funded ones are more interested in growing their business at this stage. 
So blockchain.info makes plenty of money for its owners and I bet the satoshi labs is making money. Apart from that you've got various mining equipment manufactuers as well as mining farms that are making money.

@_date: 2015-04-02 01:27:22
Your suggestion does not make sense. I can't understand it.
Just so you know if something doesn't cost money or effort it doesn't have value. Mining was cheap in the past and anyone could do it. As a result bitcoin did not have much value. When more and more people learned that bitcoin mining was like free money they started getting into it and competition intensified. That pushed up the cost of generating new bitcoins and the value of all bitcoins as well. The only way you could keep mining cheap is if you did it artificially which you can't in a decentralized system with no one in charge and no restrictions on participation.

Most of the major contributors are employed by companies and get paid for the work they do.
Generally people contribute to open source software because they use the software and want a feature included in it or a bug fixed i.e. they have an itch to scratch. Some contribute because they enjoy it. It's like a puzzle to solve. These non-financial motivations exist but if you want someone to do it day in day out you need to pay him.

Yes it's a single seed stored in your trezor and all the address specific private keys are derived from that seed. For all intents and purposes it's a single extended private key.


If one device is compromised you don't lose all your bitcoins. The hacker would have to compromise multiple devices because you need to sign each transaction using multiple keys each of which is on a different device. It's like 2FA.
Oh and you can also have joint wallets with this where multiple people have to sign the transaction to spend the bitcoins. 
Escrow wallets are also possible where two mutually distrustful parties + one escrow agent/mediator create a 2 of 3 wallet. Only if both buyer and seller sign a transaction can bitcoins sent to the wallet be spent. If there is a dispute the escrow agent can arbitrate and if need be spend with one of the other two parties.

There is a developer who asked for donations but he didn't get enough:
Donations will never be enough because people are selfish and don't donate enough. It's called tragedy of the commons.  
Developers also don't like it because they want financial security and taxes are a problem as well when it comes to receiving donations from random people.

You can do an initial validation by simply contacting them and asking them whether they accept bitcoin. Apart from that rely on your users reporting businesses that don't accept bitcoin but are listed on your site. This is called reactive moderation and you simply add a report button next to each listing which people can click to bring it to your attention. You can see this on reddit too.

A) I think they are joking around
B) If you keep listening he is asked what use it is if you can't buy anything with it. He doesn't point out the increasing merchant adoption. No mention of microsoft, dell, overstock etc. None of that. I don't think he knows enough about bitcoin to be making predictions about its price.
Edit: oh god listening further he refers to the blockchain as an intermediary and says that they (as in blockchain) have information about the identities of buyers and sellers. This guy has no idea how bitcoin works! This is total bullshit. First thing you learn about bitcoin is that its decentralized and there are no intermediaries.

Bitaddress is for end users. For mass private key generation you will want something much more efficient. See this thread:


What does this mean? You clearly don't understand how bitcoin works. Sending to an address doesn't tell you anything about the security of that address.
You can't send 1 satoshi either. The smallest amount you can send is 5430 satoshis. It's an anti-spam restriction.
@_date: 2015-03-30 14:53:52
No need to store it in the blockchain. That just adds to blockchain bloat. If the sender knows about you and your offer then they also know your website and you can publish the encrypted secret there.
If you store it in the blockchain then the sender might or might not discover it. He'd need to know to look for it and he'd need custom software to find it. Not worth the hassle IMO.
If you know the sender you can also contact him and ask him to sign a message containing his pgp public key with his address' private key. Signing messages with address private keys is more widely support among bitcoin wallets. You can then email him the secret encrypted with his pgp key.

That makes no sense. What are they verifying? That you sent bitcoin to a random address? It doesn't mean anything. It doesn't prove you have the private key corresponding to that address. It doesn't prove that *anybody* has a private key corresponding to that address:

Cheques weren't invented in England in the 1700s. They are much older than that:
"The ancient Romans are believed[7] to have used an early form of cheque known as praescriptiones in the 1st century BC.
Muslim traders are known to have used the cheque or ṣakk system since the time of Harun al-Rashid (9th century) of the Abbasid Caliphate.[8] Transporting a paper saqq was more secure than transporting money. In the 9th century, a merchant in country A could cash a saqq drawn on his bank in country B.[9]"
The word itself is derived from Arabic. 
This is just the latest example of white people denying history to suit their purposes.

Bitcoin transactions are public so you could setup a script on your webserver that periodically monitors transactions to an address and then reacts to that.
The question is how are you going to release the information so that only the sender can see it? It would be better to get people to sign up, give them a unique address and if they send the correct amount you reveal the secret to them.
If you don't want to do all that then there is another option but it won't work with every wallet. Electrum supports message encryption and decryption using bitcoin key pairs. So you could publish a message on your site that is encrypted with the sender's public key which you grabbed from the blockchain. Only he can decrypt it using his private key and electrum software.

Skrill and paypal are considered reversible payment methods. Most will not take paypal but a few will take skrill because it is harder to reverse. 
You can buy via skrill on the forums. shdvb, deadley and maidak are the only reputable traders that deal in it. You should have no trouble finding their threads here:

Electrum doesn't use bip39 word list. 
As long as you have a copy of the software you can use any wallet. In most cases you don't even need a locally archived copy because it's out there on the internet. I mean github, wallet project site, other users' hard drives and even linux distro repositories in the near future (electrum 1.9.8 is in debian wheezy backports. 2.0? Maybe the debian stable version after jessie or jessie backports).
I would go with electrum because it supports offline wallets too.

The thing is DNSSEC has the potential to make CAs obsolete so it's interesting that a CA should be drafting a DNS standard for the future. You see they are not exactly a neutral party. If they manage to make it too complicated - sabotage it - maybe it won't be used and CAs can continue to mint money.

The bootstrap torrent is obsolete and should not be used with bitcoin core 0.1


It's already a problem because there are only some 6k nodes out there and most are in the US and Europe. That number will keep going down and eventually bitcoin will become centralized with just a few full nodes in the whole world.


They want to remove transactions that have already been spent or are unspendable and only keep the unspent transactions. The full blockchain will only be held at a few archival nodes.

No that's not correct. It can support all sorts of payment systems. They just give two examples of ACH and BTC. 
"Payment Network Selector field that indicates which payment

It's too volatile. It pays no interest. It is inflationary. There is no guarantee what its value will be in the near future much less distant future. When terrorists start to use it governments will crackdown. The open ledger means you can't hide your wealth and fungibility is at risk too.
Meanwhile US interest rates are going to rise soon so the dollar is strengthening. It's much easier to move dollars across borders and you don't have to worry about a 30% fall in the value while you do it.
