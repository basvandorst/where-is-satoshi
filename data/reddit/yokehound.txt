Ars has a slightly older demographic of readers. Kids investing everything they have, people putting life savings into BTC, is stupid and they have the experience to see it.
They don't hate bitcoin or the blockchain, far from it, they see the current mania for what it is.

It's cause they've seen huge amounts of fraud from stolen cards being used to buy crypto, money they can't recover and have to write off. Seems reasonable. You can always transfer fiat instead of using cc.

The new code *allows* banks/cc issuers to make additional charges, by considering a crypto purchase to be a cash advance. I would imagine this won't fly in the EU with the new regulations, but you never know. By defining it as a cash advance there.ay be some silly loophole.

Have a look at their Twitter. The Reddit army has already arrived. Not at all cringy comments
