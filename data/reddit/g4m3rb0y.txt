lol 5k? You just showed them they should not accept bitcoin, good job.
@_date: 2014-05-27 13:29:14
Not again this open letter bullshit.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:17:00
Professor Bitcorn was right after all.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:33:35
It's actually good news.
@_date: 2014-10-22 12:23:18
So your conversation partner doesn't even know what traditional bits are.
"Yes, it is secure. It uses modern 256 bit encryption."
"What are bits? What is encryption?"
Way better conversation. Facepalm. 
Don't talk autistic to non-techy people and you will NEVER have this conversation.

Correction, the protocol is based on **satoshis**.
00000000.00000001 = 1 satoshi	(1 s or 1 sat)  
00000000.00000010 = 10 satoshi	(10 s or 10 sat) 
00000000.00000100 = 100 satoshi	(100 s or 100 sat) 
00000000.00001000 = 1 kilo-satoshi	(1 ks or 1 ksat) 
00000000.00010000 = 10 kilo-satoshi	(10 ks or 10 ksat) 
00000000.00100000 = 100 kilo-satoshi	(100 ks or 100 ksat)
00000000.01000000 = 1 mega-satoshi	(1 Ms or 1 Msat)
00000000.10000000 = 10 mega-satoshi	(10 Ms or 10 Msat)
00000001.00000000 = 100 mega-satoshi	(100 Ms or 100 Msat)
00000010.00000000 = 1 giga-satoshi	(1 Gs or 1 Gsat)
00000100.00000000 = 10 giga-satoshi	(10 Gs or 10 Gsat)
00001000.00000000 = 100 giga-satoshi	(100 Gs or 100 Gsat)
00010000.00000000 = 1 terasatoshi	(1 Ts or 1 Tsat)
00100000.00000000 = 10 tera-satoshi	(10 Ts or 10 Tsat)
01000000.00000000 = 100 tera-satoshi	(100 Ts or 100 Tsat)
10000000.00000000 = 1 peta-satoshi	(1 Ps or 1 Psat)

Dat logic. Why would anyone buy a 350$ bitcoin? There are early adopters who bought at &lt; 1$.
@_date: 2014-12-25 02:56:59
lol $3.
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:46:57
Wow you are retarded. My conversation example was in case you don't call it bitcoin bits of course. Your conversation is still fucked up.
Now i know why you came up with this example in the first place. Try to be less autistic.
@_date: 2014-09-30 13:43:13
I think you are delusional. 5k is no demand for amazon. Try again with 100k minimum.
@_date: 2014-05-25 17:14:14
TL;DR: The late 2013 bubble was fake/not real. Don't expect another one.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:12:44
Hahaha, dude you are delusional. 
3. The superior "altcoin" could be revolutionary in the core structure. You can't just patch everything. And patching takes a loooong time. If the altcoin is considered superior to bitcoin it's already too late and everyone changed anyway. -&gt; have fun with single digits
4. Even if a fatal bug gets patched it would result in a complete loss of confidence 
-&gt; have fun with single digits
5. The "satoshi entity" and probably other people can crash the market for years if they like. -&gt; have fun with single digits
A rise is more likely than winning lottery but surely not inevitable.
@_date: 2014-10-31 11:36:44
so... it's actually good news?
@_date: 2014-11-13 09:27:44
SI system? I thought 2264.54 bits = 283.0675 bytes!
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:47:09
Or the best thing: creating a fake bubble to get mainstream attention.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:57:20
Just wait a few weeks.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:13:39


Cringe. I wouldn't store more than 20$ on this security mess. One wrong app download and a rootkit drains your wallet. Have fun.


This is not a secure standard. Playstore apps are not safe. Especially if bitcoin becomes more popular and malware attacks get more rewarding.

How exactly is this different from standard buyable ingame currency in pay to win games? You just don't need a decentralized currency for a game. It just looks fitting on first sight but actually doesn't solve anything. Most game companies actually try the opposite: prevent player selling/buying ingame currency for real money. Most people don't like pay to win games.

Bitcoin is not quick if not already set up. Paypal is much less hassle.
@_date: 2015-03-11 02:32:35
This already happened to people who bought bitcoin &lt; 1$. But Bitcoin is already 5 years old. Thats not new for a technology in the 21th century.
@_date: 2015-03-22 03:42:42
If it was my wedding i would uninvite you. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:05:35
Why is this a milestone? Almost no one wants gambling in games. It's causing too much legal issues. It is and will stay niche for games. Bitcoin doesn't add much to gaming.
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:18:56
I'm with you. 'Dramatic increase'.... this is buttcoin material.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:02:25
BREAKING: i downvoted this post
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:55:07
What is this? I hope you are trolling. Why would you borrow money to invest (rather speculate) in bitcoin. Yes, there's a good chance you will lose a lot. It's basically gambling.
@_date: 2015-03-13 19:30:23
Gambling in games doesn't need bitcoin. No one does it because of legal issues. That's the point. All bitcoin can be is another purchase option for games.
@_date: 2015-03-11 02:42:48
If you knew anything about software development you would realize just because bitcoin is updateable doesn't mean it will get the best possible updates. You can't make big changes in an existing userbase. That's way easier with new software. Room enough for a better coin to take over.
@_date: 2015-02-02 04:08:35
How does this post get any upvotes? This is just a terrible idea.
1. It's online gambling and would bring huuuuge legal issues. Thats why no game does it.
2. This can be way easier done with ingame money. For example Blizzard and Steam already have real money wallets. 
Just another problem bitcoin can't fix.
@_date: 2015-02-17 05:39:23
They even include *"unused"* Cortex-M3 processors in the hdd controller which apparently do *nothing*.
If this doesn't smell fishy...
