They want you to bounce in your home or certain designated places.

Might as well put Tres Commas up on your wall, there Russ.

I had brussels sprouts with dinner last night. I'm expecting the same.

I wrote a bot to take the emotion out of it. I'm content with 2-3% gains. They add up. The bot is responsible for a 60% increase in BTC over four months. It will be sad on September 12 when I have to move to binance.us (or something else completely) and I'm limited in what I can trade. :(

That's emotional trading. If you can't keep emotion out, then you shouldn't trade. You've gotta be a financially ruthless Ferengi with the ice cold nerves of a Vulcan to make it trading.

Look up technical indicators first. Bollinger bands, relative strength index, moving average convergence/divergence, etc. Learn how to use them.
Binance has an api. They will give you trading data in real time via websockets for all the trading pairs. Up to 500 "klines", or candlesticks.
They also provide a list of rules for each trading pair.
My workflow goes like this: make a list of pairs. Get websockets data for each trading pair. Listen for buy signals (using chosen indicators) and make a buy when the signal trips. Then listen for sell signals on that pair. 
If you're familiar with Node, npm has a binance api wrapper and a technical indicators library.

Folks buy and sell event tickets via third party vendors like stub hub to hide illicit transactions. A fictional transaction to encapsulate the real transaction. We should shut down ticketed events. All of them.
