8 wallets claimed so far. 22 wallets and 1.775 BTC still up for grabs

It doesn't work like that. Hacking the twitter account has nothing to do with the bitcoin wallet or bitcoins. You can register your twitter account so that people can verify the person they are sending to if they know their Twitter account. Example seansoutpost is verified to the seansoutpost twitter account.

Some excellent suggestion. We'll run this by the whole team tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:44:47
Thanks for the feedback! 
* Strange, we have no problem getting it to work on the standard android browser. Tried it on 3 different devices
* We'll look into why it doesn't work on Android Firerfox
* Please explain what you mean about the brainwallet feature not working
@_date: 2014-08-07 21:35:09
By request we just added a settings tab and feature to select from 21 different currencies. Let us know how else we can improve RushWallet.

Create your own instant fundraiser or a payment request at  
In less than 1 minute you can create a wallet, create a fundraising campaign, and share the link with others via facebook, Twitter or anywhere else you choose.

Are you in china?? :)
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:50:56
This is a known issue. We are looking into it.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:46:20
Exactly! You can even import it into [Kryptokit]( and work with the same wallet (as long as its not a password protected RushWallet)
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:45:50
Its a Javascript wallet :) - require javascript to work.
@_date: 2014-08-09 18:18:19
Nothing. Get yours quick!
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:44:49
Thanks Conrad. Glad you like it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 00:57:51
Unfortunately the password has to be chosen before the wallet is created as it becomes encrypted in the URL. Just create a new one with with a password and move the coins over. heck create 10 news ones if you want :)
@_date: 2014-08-07 16:39:13
Thanks for pointing that out. Correcting now!
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:46:02
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:27:13
Bitaddress.org is not a wallet. Rushwallet is a wallet with send and receive functions. Two completely different animals.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:59:09
* We are right now pushing live a settings tab with the option to change the currencies. Ask and ye shall receive :)
* We agree that a larger QR code should be an option and are working on that as we speak.

Here's a link to the Sean's Outpost fundraiser. The meters been moving up today!
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:48:35
We've been working closely with the [OneName.io]( team. It's been a great relationship thus far!
@_date: 2014-08-07 22:30:58
Done! 21 different currencies have been added.
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:44:39
  Since its decentralized it will take a few hours for the name to register on the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:39:45
Check the password box before you generate the wallet. It will then prompt you for a password after you colour the icon..
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:58:37
Thanks so much.... yes, Decentral is the bomb!
@_date: 2014-08-07 23:24:03
Sure! Here's a link to the logo.

RushWallet is more secure than InstaWallet in two specific ways:
* Funds are stored client side, not server-side.
* The private key is stored in the URL after the hashtag. By HTTP standards, that part of the URL is not sent to the server when you make a request; it remains purely client-side, so the server never sees what any of the private keys are.
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:47:07
Exactly. Think of it as a quick easy instant wallet with optional extra security.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:53:02
Awesome! Thanks guys!
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:12:06
In your rushwallet URL grab everything past the # (hashtag). This code can be imported into another wallet like Kryptokit or blockchain.info using the "import brainwallet" feature. We will be creating tutorials for this feature very soon.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:14:49

Anthony from KryptoKit / Rushwallet here. Let's get ot the bottom of this. Do you use skype? I'll pm you my skype contact info and email address and we're try to figure out what happened.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:25:53
We've got some interesting tricks up our sleeve...stay tuned.

1. The balance should be dynamically updating.
3. I'll take this to the team and see what we can do.
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:04:41
Fixed. thanks for seeing that.
@_date: 2014-08-07 18:22:52
There is a banner prompt to bookmark that appears right after you create your wallet. It disappears after 7 seconds. There is also a warning if you try to leave the page instructing the user to bookmark the wallet....and of course its in the instructions page to ensure you bookmark. Unfortunately, a call up dialogue is not possible. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 14:40:04
It should be dynamically updating. We'll look into it.
@_date: 2014-08-09 16:35:25
Read up on OneName. Its really cool, decentralized, and you can link to verifiable accounts like Twitter.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:11:47
We agree. Additional currencies will be added very soon.
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:50:53
Add an encrypted password to the URL is you want added security. For me I trust my PC and the way we designed Rushwallet, and don't want to have to enter a password on my hot wallet. We've given the user the option.
@_date: 2014-08-07 17:38:36
We're going to work on getting [onename.io]( more widely accepted.
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:26:20
Good job Trace!
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:09:46
Thanks for trying out RushWallet and for using Kryptokit. 
1. We don't require confirmations. Similar to Blockchain.info. 
2. Our devs will check into adding this.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:10:25
Nope, even in Google chrome nothing past the # ever leaves the address bar.
@_date: 2014-08-10 14:58:50
We'll be adding it in KryptoKit shortly.
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:17:15
Like passwords, brainwallets can be extremely secure if used correctly. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:29:39
Also there is a progress bar so that you can track how much has been funded and how many people have contributed.

@_date: 2014-08-08 01:02:08
We are an easy instant wallet that adds security features should you choose to deploy them. We have no intention of making the default to be password enabled as there are plenty of wallets you can choose from that work that way.
@_date: 2014-08-09 18:09:52

With OneName you can receive BTC with an address from your favorite wallet OR use our web wallet where your password encrypts your private keys. Your username is like a domain name - it's on a decentralized namespace and so you can transfer it anywhere you want.Your username and bitcoin address are linked in a public data store, so users of any wallet supporting "pay by username" can send bitcoins right to your name.

As I'm sure everyone knows private browsing is always an option, as is clearing the browser history if this is a concern. 
Keep in mind the goal of this project is to provide a fast, instant and simple wallet; some might even use the word "disposable". Use it, empty it, move on. If you want to keep it for a longer term then be smart and don't leave a trail on your local machine.

Thanks for the compliment. If you were to check the code you would see that the keys are generated client side and not sent to any servers.
@_date: 2013-05-28 17:55:22
Your showing a very specific code that is commonly used.
Our code was developed before Carbonwallet was released. In fact, We've never even looked at their code. So no, we did not take anything from CarbonWallet.

Hash tags in the URL are only visible client side and are not indexed. Unlike Instawallet we do not hold any of the coins and secret keys are generated client side and never sent to a server.
@_date: 2013-05-27 14:18:22
We recommend bookmarking or saving the URL as the first step when you land on the site. We would also recommend NOT adding a "messed-up" string after the hash-sign if your planning on using the current Bitcoin address for the purpose it's intended to be used for.
Making any manual change in the URL will create a new wallet address upon refresh.

lol I totally agree with what you're saying. The beta stamp definitely looks out of place and I think should be further left and centered better. I'll address that with the team. As for the location of the miner's fee statement I'll bring that up as well. Thanks for your input. Greatly appreciated!
