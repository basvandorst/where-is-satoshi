Do you go to restaurants to order food and then ask the waiter scrape it in the garbage? No right, because you want to eat the food. Would you invite friends and family to a restaurant, and offer to pay knowing that they like to order food and then ask the waiter to scrape it in the garbage? No right, because you don't want to waste food or your money. It's not because you're stingy, it's because it would be wasteful. It's the same as watching someone draw a big ass cloud and exhale like it's a vape.  
    
Like I said originally, there are other ways to enjoy weed that aren't smoking it, you could eat it or drink it in a tea, both of which are just as viable as smoking and neither of which makes waste.

I wish I had 1 BTC. But hey, 0.1 BTC = 0.1 BTC too right?

I care. Stop wasting my shit. Go eat some edibles or drink some tea if you can't smoke.

I was talking about my weed. Obviously Elon Musk could fuck the whole drug game up, Escobar style if he wanted to.

I've been DCAing since 16,000. It's looking less like a joy ride and [more like this.](

It's dips all the way down.

~~Yeah, but that's *inflation*. Deflation would be you lending me 1 BTC, and me giving you back 0.8 BTC (20% interest) when it came time to pay.~~ 
 
I'm tired and an idiot. I conflated interest and inflation.  
  
My point still stands though, that when it came time to pay back it'd be less than the value of the 1 BTC that you lent me, which benefits me. How much less I pay is dependent on the amount of deflation.

Being able to purchase more things is worse for the economy?

And your father smells of elderberries.

But why? On the one hand it won't affect anyone, but on the other it doesn't solve any issues.  
  
Do criminals, gangs, and terrorists not have access to banks and credit cards?

You should probably get around to restocking the shelves before management shows up.

From Investopedia: 
 
Moneyness is a description of a derivative relating its strike price to the price of its underlying asset. Moneyness describes the intrinsic value of an option in its current state. The term moneyness is most commonly used with put and call options and is an indicator as to whether the option would make money were it exercised immediately. Moneyness can be measured in respect to the underlying stock or other asset's current/spot price or its future price.
In English - Moneyness is the difference between a derivative, ex: stocks, current price and its prospective price. A higher moneyness indicates that it's prospective price will be further (either negative or positive) away from the current price.
