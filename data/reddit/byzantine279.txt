Not a very useful graph.  What would be more useful is to include what the average income is in unadjusted dollars along side this.  You'll see that while the PP of the dollar has gone down that is simply because there are more of them.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:36:09
It's best not to think too hard about that.
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:27:15
A 97% drop in the value of the dollar is meaningless if people still have equal or greater* purchasing power, that is part of the point of fiat money.
*this is the reality.
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:45:52
Yes, which would be a problem is people had static income.  They do not.  You will find income rose at the same rate or faster than inflation reduces the value of the dollar, meaning the purchasing power of the average person went up.  And since currency is merely a way to facilitate trade its "value" is irrelevant as long as it continues to serve that purpose.
@_date: 2014-07-31 04:28:54
That's the point, they are trying to make it seem like the dollar lost most of it's value because it is a fiat currency, not because of natural inflation over the course of 2 centuries.

When did I claim to be a genius?
You just have to not be an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:32:54
Uhhh. No one.  NO ONE.  Has been able to do that with any long term success.  A monkey is just as good as the best stock broker.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:27:49
...are you stupid?
Of course its a stock market.  If anything its a stock market with *less* actual substance behind it (ie none).
All nonessential markets behave in roughly the same way.  Why would crypto be any different?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:41:12
Except you have a billion players to research.  Oh, and the vast majority of the data you find is incomplete or just plain wrong.  And you have no means of figuring out which data it is.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:45:13
This isnt uncharted. Thats my entire point. This is playing out like every other new speculative market in human history. And like every new speculative market in human history it is going to fall apart and cause great damage to the economy as it does so.
Otherwise, crypto is no different than commodity backed currency, so yes, we have seen a world where it and fiat have coexisted and competed.
Fiat won.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:31:14
Nah, the analogy just got taken too literally by you guys.  It's rather amusing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:35:24
Well, I suspect they are.  Its just the amount of input data required is so far beyond our ability to process it might as well be impossible.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:20:23


Or they are true believers^tm
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:29:56
Yeah.  It's always interesting when people think it's the other guy doing it, when their foot is so deep you can see it coming out their ass.
I don't really care what the vote is - this is a sub for people to hype a coin, of course they are going to take bad news about it poorly.
I made a simple statement of fact - in stocks research has been done:  Random choice consistently performed identically to the supposedly best brokers over the long term.  Stocks are simply a market, so lessons learned there can trivially be applied to crypto currencies.  Ergo, performance is unpredictable.  Anyone who did well just got plain lucky or are cheating (ie running a scam or information they are not supposed to have.)
Markets are predictable in some sense, but they are impossible to time correctly with any accuracy, making it pointless in practice.  The current crypto market is pretty much like the 1920's stock market.  And everyone knows how that ended.  No one can provide a compelling reason this isn't going to end the same way, for similar reasons.  The problem, of course, is that figuring out when its the real crash and when it's just part of the ride?  Impossible to do in advance.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:36:00
Nah, governments are legally obligated to accept that paper as payment for debts.  That is meaningful, since governments are supposed to be the only ones who can physically threaten you into payment.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:38:32
Yep.  Seeing broad trends isn't too hard:  Crypto is behaving pretty similarly to the 1920's stock market.  Including lots of instant millionaires.
We all know how *that* ended.
Problem is guessing when it's going to stop bouncing and start falling for good isn't predictable.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:25:02
not quite.  Gold has uses in electronics, and it looks pretty.  That may not seem important, but the lack of ease of showing off you have X bitcoins pretty much renders it inferior to gold as a commodity.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:25:51
Also if your stock account gets hacked into the transactions can be reversed as fraud.
If your keys get stolen you are shit out of luck.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:32:05
And all the analysis in the world wont help you when you get matched with different players.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:21:36
I think my brain just died.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:39:59
Frankly that applies to all crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:57:38
And here we have the gamblers fallacy in full display.
Of course I am oversimplifying some - stocks are related to companies and will go up/down accordingly with major accouncements they make.
Crypto does not have that relation, so its the system Im simplifying stocks to behave like.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:28:11
Okay, analogy has gone too far:
With poker there actually is an element of skill involved, but in stocks there isn't.  Year over year there *isn't* the same people doing the best.  Everyone performs roughly average over the long run.
@_date: 2018-02-05 00:48:34


No, that is only one formulation of the fallacy. The fallacy is better stated as the idea that past performance changes the probability of future performance.
For example, a roullette wheel landing black 23 times in a row.  The fallacy is that it is now due to land on red.  It does not require anyone to have actually bet.
Similarly the recent performance of a stock has little bearing on what it will do next.


That is what scientific studies have done.  It turns out all of that is no more accurate than random chance.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:29:02
I was just choosing not to engage.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:30:11
Except we have plenty of evidence for dozens of different markets that past behavior is not indicative of future performance.
You are going: “well, it didnt rain last week. Therefore it will never rain again.”  While the rest of us are going: “uhhh thats not how that works...”
Tha pattern for markets is that the pattern is unpredictable and inconsistent.  That is all.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:59:01
None of that is actually different so... im not sure of your point.
The speculative markets that bring the whole thing down are only a fraction of the economy and hence worth considering separately.
Crypto didnt inflate the bubble.  It IS the bubble.
As to your last paragraph... that has nothing to do with fiat currency. And thinking it does is foolish, you are trying to assign blame to the method of purchase.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:42:28
Lol. Yep. Im the one with no idea whats going on because I state a simple fact.
Long term market behavior is unpredictable. You will not consistently be able to beat a random monkey.
