This is genius. Although I’ll a HODLER well past 1 BTC = 1 Lambo.

Good luck HODLER!

I don't see how it doesn't.
Much better reserve currency then the USD.

Yep, its call good business not something we normally see from politicians
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:46:38

Far from upset Warren, in fact if you found this technology revolutionary I'd be worried - time has proven that picking disruptive tech not to be your thing.

FYI Byteball have another one coming up too. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:51:43

Every little bit of bitcoin today, becomes a BIG bit of Bitcoin one day in the future. Congrats to you. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:36:23
I'd do it then man, it's better to jump on in then sit on the sidelines waiting for the drop that might never come. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:34:49
YES. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:56:27
Yes, lets me save you some time and say if you're planning on using a hardware wallet Ledger Nano S is one of the best. 
And if you plan to buy online try coinbase. (Not sure if they service your country although it's worth checking out.) 
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:52:18
Ledger. Easy decision. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:50:47
Good for you - never to late. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:51:57
Oh it's a serious question - dude. HODL. And go work your ass off to get more. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:38:24
Viabtc.com is accepting trading for BCH for BTC, although you'll have to wait 20 confirmations for the withdrawal of your BTC once converted. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:54:52
Double down. It's a heck load of fun. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:58:39
This is an attack on bitcoin. We have survived all previous attacks and this one will be no different. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 13:09:03
Common, lets not be silly now.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:03:16
Buy and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:48:37
And sir, I'm sure you're the type of person living in their moms basement pissed that they didn't invest enough into Bitcoin, if any. 
So now you're just hoping for it to all blow up in everyone's faces. 
IT WONT. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:25:32
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:31:42
Buy a Ledger wallet and you can use changelly. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:24:35
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 09:01:37
It's personal preference. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:05:12
If your not planning to trade or sell anytime soon take your funds off the exchange and put into an offline wallet then just HODL on while the shit show blows over. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:49:25
If you're asking the question - you probably should. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:22:48
We understand what you mean, all good man. Yes - it's normal. You'll pay a premium to purchase BTC, it's a sign of a great currency - and you'll be able to sell it at a premium also when the time comes, depending on market conditions. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:36:15
Be sure that you've set up two factor authentication wherever you can coindesk, email ect, it's not ideal although it should be fine until your Ledger arrives if you have tight security with your passwords.
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:25:14
"You don't want to spend your golden years being poor and miserable." - that's why he invested in BITCOIN. 
I'd say he's very wise.

And you got it. More moon to come for the patience. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 00:25:02
Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:02:05
I am saying parties within the Bitcoin community believe they know the best way to scale - i.e Segwit or 8mb blocks ect. 
Although we can't agree on the best way to scale a the main chain, so they end up forking and creating uncertainty within the space. We have a governance issue. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:36:10

Nothing. Just HODL your coins for offline. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:32:28
No thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:02:39
I can appreciate the enthusiasm - although these are getting annoying now dude. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:48:06
Buy a Nano Ledger S. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:24:17

@_date: 2018-06-21 23:14:12
Dude looks amazing. 
Great job.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:53:53
ALWAYS HODL. Never seen someone regret hodling. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:01:46
This is truly fucked up. I think you have a gambling problem man. I hope you got the lesson, and things turn around for you. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 22:37:33
What you call "gambling", I call investing. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 13:49:28
Localbitcoins.com - bitcoin was designed to be P2P - this way you'll be able to get the BTC you want without all the restrictions. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 03:09:45
And we just broke $4100.
@_date: 2018-06-19 22:59:28
Volatility moves in both directions- so have to disagree. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:13:14
Yep, doubters are what giver believers opportunity to win. If everyone believed the opportunity would be gone...
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:40:24
Not even 1% of the population are in the crypto markets - back yourself and go all in. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:23:39
Agreed - it's getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 11:21:13
If your nervous you're more then likely over extended. 
Rebalance it and enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:07:30

@_date: 2017-11-20 06:03:33
You just made HISTORY friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:16:06
Buy and HODL. Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:07:34
Legitimatises Bitcoin even more. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:40:43
Interesting, sounds like something Luke would say!
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:30:04
It’s a thing - congrats HODLER. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:51:11
Congrats dude. You're 15 and found Bitcoin - invest away. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 11:29:50
Nah. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:33:51
Small amounts today could be big amounts in the future - congrats HODLER. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:37:45
Great interview - thanks for sharing. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:40:44

@_date: 2017-11-29 00:07:50
Legendary - thank you kind sir! 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:18:46
Plenty of upside to come. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:31:04
Find someone who wants to buy your BTC And sell it to them. A good place to start is localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:09:03
Is it happening again?
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:49:38
GENTLEMAN. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:05:58
Thanks for posting. Glad I came across this. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:25:42

@_date: 2017-09-07 12:00:25
Be careful advertising this. 
Edit: and welcome! 
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:41:18
Thanks for sharing with the community. Good for the noobs. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:31:16
I recommend for everyone to own at least some BTC. When the bubble pops in weeks, months or years they will most flow back into proven coins like Bitcoin. This coin has proven it can hold value and grow over long periods of time. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:35:22
Take your coins offline using a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 11:20:28
Your best bet is to start moving your money into cash, and buying as you can withdrawal on localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:26:22
Again, will kindly disagree. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:28:33
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:24:40
What a load of nonsense - that's 30 seconds I'll never get back.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:40:44
No. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:58:34
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:29:11
The price moves in cycles - right now where consolidation mode while we refuel then you'll see it shoot off again due to adoption, network effect ect...
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:38:51
I upvoted. Seemed like a fair call.

@_date: 2017-09-07 09:44:32
No, thank you. Took a look at your post history and it looks like you're already convinced it's going to drop.   
@_date: 2017-09-07 04:45:46
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:28:20

@_date: 2017-09-02 12:22:44
Nah, that was the dip.
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:44:09
lel. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:32:28
They take you BTC and give you back a fraction of it, and call it "mining" - it's a scam. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:12:26
Power to you good sir! You understand bitcoin, you've already won. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:43:36
Yes, best time to buy is when uncertainty is in the air. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:39:54
Great hodling with you, gotta do what you've gotta do. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 00:28:41
No. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 04:04:05
Why? You only lose money when you sell... If you've been involved in these markets for any substantial amount of time you'll know that this kind of volatility happens each time we break another thousand. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:25:26
Great, thank you sir!
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:45:58
Buy. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:30:42
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:15:46
You must be new here. Welcome to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:40:53
Be careful, some people i.e 'domain brokers' might tell you to let it go because they may have an opportunity for it - if you believe in it, keep it. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:19:54
Fair call - good for others to know also. 
In response to your questions, it does come down to privacy for lots of buyers.
I know a few people that buy on the exchanges then sell on LBC for a tidy profit. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:55:27
Look at the history of these accounts talking about the price dropping - fudsters creating uncertainty so you sell. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:46:57
Yes, this is pretty normal. You'll usually pay a premium for Bitcoin. Congrats on your investments so far. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 02:05:42
ETFs are for the masses.
@_date: 2017-09-08 01:05:48
When I doubt, scam. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 23:47:54
A conspiracy theory if I've ever seen one. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:09:38
This is great, thanks for creating.
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:13:04
PayPal transactions are reversible, your Bitcoin transactions are not. Be careful. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:59:29
Head over to the r/shapeshiftio and prove your case to them - if this is truthful, I wish you the best. I wish this on no honest individual.

@_date: 2018-07-23 04:25:11

This is how they roll.

Do decentralized exchanges plan to have Fiat-to-Crypto pairs? 
Or is it just Crypto-to-Crypto?
I am trying to figure out if decentralized exchanges lead to the extinction of centralized exchanges.

Apple? Or just android. Looks great.

Treat no exchange as trustworthy.

Take note newbies. We have a HODLER.

You're in good hands with the Ledger team.

Not willing to click on a random link. What's your concern?

The open market where we can start trading - right nows it's just futures on a few exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:53:00
And yes, they support signing. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:14:26
We are still in the early days of adoption.

Get cash from ATM ~&gt; Go to localbitcoins.com ~&gt; buy bitcoin and HODL. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 01:38:46
Local Bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:29:37
Yep - standard. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:19:53
If you're asking if you should sell, you don't really understand Bitcoin - do further research. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:03:43
Dead set LEGEND.

Yep, I emailed them when I received my 2nd one. I reacted very similarly to you - although the video above made sense and put me at ease.

Dear ViaBTC users,
As August 1st is coming near, we are about to witness a significant moment in Bitcoin history. After three years of debating on Bitcoin scaling, three of the proposals are gaining the majority support from the community: BIP 91 (SegWit2x), BIP 148 (UASF) and Bitcoin ABC (UAHF).
ViaBTC has already made precautions for these possibilities. We support SegWit2x under New York Agreement, in the meanwhile we have released 148/ETH, BCC/CNY and BCC/BTC trading pairs on June 8th and July 22nd to prepare for BIP 148 (UASF) and Bitcoin ABC (UAHF).
For the upcoming BTC forking period, ViaBTC will continue to provide maximum protection for customer assets and try our best to meet all users’ demands for deposit and withdrawal. The arrangements are as follows:
1. 148 Allocation
At 00:00 1st August 2017 (UTC Time), ViaBTC will take a “snapshot” of every user’s BTC balance at the time. On the basis of “snapshot”, we will allocate 1 “148” for 1 BTC, 1 “148” for 1 “BTC_FROZEN2” and exchange 1 BTC_FROZEN1 back to 1 BTC. Meanwhile, we will close the trading of “BTC” into 1 “148” and 1 “BTC_FROZEN1”.
148/ETH trading pair is available if you wish to buy or sell 148.
2. BCC Allocation
At 00:00 1st August 2017 (UTC Time), ViaBTC will take a “snapshot” of every user’s BTC balance at the time. On the basis of “snapshot”, we will allocate 1 “BCC” for 1 BTC and exchange 1 BTC_FROZEN2 back to 1 BTC. Meanwhile, we will close the trading of “BTC” into “BCC” and “BTC_FROZEN2”.
BCC/CNY and BCC/BTC trading pairs are available if you wish to buy or sell BCC.
3. BCC Deposit and Withdrawal
To prevent possible rollback and replay attack, ViaBTC will suspend withdrawals of BTC an hour before and after the 148/BCC forking, at:
1) 23:00 31st July to 01:00 1st August 2017 (UTC Time)
2) 11:20 - 13:20 1st August 2017 (UTC Time)
During the periods, BTC withdrawals will be suspended but deposits are available. All other cryptocurrency will not be affected on deposit and withdrawal.
4. If New Fork Fails To Survive
After 00:00 15th August 2017 (UTC Time), if the BIP148 split chain cannot last, it will be considered failed. We will then cancel the “148/ETH” trading pair and all your “148” assets will be erased from your account.
After 00:00 15th August 2017 (UTC Time), if the BitcoinABC split chain cannot last, it will be considered failed. We will then cancel the “BCC/CNY” and “BCC/BTC” trading pairs and all your “BCC” assets will be erased from your account.
5. Risks Warning
During BTC forking, BTC, BCC and 148 trading and prices may fluctuate drastically due to market uncertainty. We suggest all users consider your risk tolerance before participating in any trading.
If BTC scaling plan fails to execute, you will face the risk of losing all 148 and BCC assets. Please make precautions for these potential risks.
If you don’t know how to handle these technical issues in the process of BTC forking, you might encounter replay attacks and therefore risk losing asset. In this case, we suggest you deposit your BTC in ViaBTC exchange and we will guarantee 100% safety of all your assets with ViaBTC.
Please feel free to drop an email to support if you have any questions.
ViaBTC reserves the rights of final explanation for this statement.

Post in r/ledgerwallet -they have great support. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:31:07
r/btc are pro BCC, not so much this sub. I subscribe to both to get a clear picture on the overall sediment of happenings.

Focus on working and buying coins. Don't waste precious time with mining opportunities, they will mostly screw you.
