Yes the grammar and way of writing is similar too. The dots at the end of each phrase, without missing a single one.  The use of question marks/exclamation marks without space before.  And those simleys :)

Why buying so much in one row?  Looks strange
@_date: 2016-08-15 20:53:56
It is working on my side
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:29:34
So should I buy more xbt or ether ? 
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:51:54
That would be too easy for them to launder the coins. Knowing that a hacker can launder the stolen coins in that {easy}  way will definitely attract more people to steal . And this will not be reviewed as a positive thing for the crypto currency world

So can I have my face picture on the ledger ? That would be interesting

On the internet , we basically can't trust anyone.  That's what I learnt from past mistakes {got scammed $600. While trying to invest in bitcoin in 2013-2014}
At that time, I was blind in trusting another person behind his computer. That's why now I went for an exchanger. 
The best for you is to acquire the basic knowledge around cryptocurrency first especially bitcoin since you want to invest in it.  Best of luck ��

Oh God.  I did enter my account details on this phishing site.  Fortunately I did notice the 1 on it and was suspicious to change my password and 2FA immediately ��

It is actually more secure to download the source and run it on a local machine without access to internet to generate the address. A hacker can always logs in your pass phrase and address if the bitaddress site is compromised

Boy you got a lot of luck buying at $24
You are today sad because you sold at around $5K. This is your ego for more talking for you.
You got in and made a load of cash. Alone with this you should be happy! 
To everyone, don’t let your ego for profits ruin you. Be happy for what you have gained

Guess who bought btc at 1100$ and invested it immediately in ICN, so no big loss
@_date: 2017-01-07 10:14:53
Chinese Yuan increased against the USD. Chinese people was selling. China count 95% of total BTC i think

That is theeee risk of investing. You should accept it if you lose.
Sadly everyone went once in the same boat as you. Don’t invest money that you cannot afford to lose.
