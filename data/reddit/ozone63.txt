Only because they didn't register as a futures commission, which requires audits and paperwork.
They didn't want to comply with those regulations,  so instead they had to comply with the regulations that prevented them from having a cold wallet. I see that as them avoiding one regulatory structure because it would require audits and money, and then consequently subjecting themselves to another regulatory structure that left coins vulnerable to attack.
Obviously the right decision was not made to jump through the necessary hoops to register as a futures commission.

Wat. How does that have anything to do with bitcoin? The banks didnt *steal* anyones money in a way BTC would have prevented. A whole fuck load of people were manipulated into thinking they could afford homes that they couldnt, and then those toxic mortagages were bundled and traded until the whole thing collapsed on itself.
How in the hell does bitcoin prevent someone from taking out a loan larger than they can afford, and defaulting? How does deregulation prevent predatory lending and trading of assets they cannot evaluate? Thats how that shit fucking happened in thr first place. 
This is just low effort, "people dont trust the banks!!" And somehow thats an argument for bitcoin no matter the premise.

This is not THE use case for bitcoin, guys. Jesus christ. Only Libertarian fanatics think that bitcoin totally usurps all fiat currency everywhere around the world. It fucking sucks in this use case anyway. People cannot make everyday transactions with confirm times and fees. It is NOT a currency for circulation. How about you be fucking realistic?  
*Maybe* when lightning network is implemented, *maybe* large coorporations build on Bitcoin, and then *maybe* we see mass adoption. Slow the fuck up. Zimbabweans bought a tiny amount of bitcoin that they cant even use as a currency. Calm the fuck down.

I think maybe it's easy for them to forget what it's like to be new to this, because they've been part of this community for so long. I hate to generalize, but I often see one of these two attitudes from experienced users here:
1) They don't think it's that complicated/intimidating for the general user, probably because they've put way more time than they realize into educating themselves about bitcoin (maybe because they have been around to watch it grow and learn along the way).
2) They do recognize that it's complicated/intimidating, and feel like normal people aren't capable of handling it. A lot of "Normal people will fuck it up" type comments.
I think the second attitude is totally OK to have, but you have to realize that you're going to discourage adoption if you have a condescending attitude about it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:34:48
You're not wrong at all, but anything other than "It will go up exponentially forever and Usurp all fiat currency around the world" will be downvoted.
Suggesting an asset that has increased 2500% over the past 2 years *is in a bubble* also garners downvotes.
I hold a decent amount of Bitcoin, but there is no way this isnt a huge bubble. Utility has not changed at all. People entering now are excited about bitcoin because of the price. That is it.
Everyone knows random friends/family asking about crypto now. The "new", "dumb" money got here a while ago. Bitcoin bought me a house, so it will owe me nothing if it goes to zero dollars and my holdings are worthless. That said, I am still tempted to take the rest of my profit from this madness.
@_date: 2015-07-20 00:53:49
I had read quite a bit about how bitcoin works in the past, but when circle gave out $5.00 to sign up a couple of months ago, I actually did it. I think that it would require a lot more for people completely unfamiliar with it, though.
Now I have spent hours and hours educating myself about bitcoin, security, the different services that are available, etc, and have put some money into it. So the incentive obviously worked for me, at that price point.
@_date: 2015-07-15 15:23:07
I'm experiencing that right now. I'm very new to bitcoin, and have had to read for hours and hours about how it works, storing keys in wallets, security, different services, etc. I've enjoyed learning about it in detail.
But you guys(at least the bitcoin community here) have made me so nervous, that I thought about exchanging my bitcoin and never buying another one. And I'm not some person where this tech is over my head. I understand why security is so important and the risks associated with storage (I've read quite thoroughly into it), but with so many options and the countless comments saying that "normal people will fuck it up", it's really really off putting. I feel like if it was off putting to me, it will be very off putting to people in general.
But now that I have a pretty good grasp around the whole thing, you know what? I don't see anything wrong with using circle..... at least for anything up to a couple thousand dollars worth of coin.
I understand that i dont control the keys, but they're insured, most of the coins are in cold storage, 2FA and multisig are standard, and most of all its easy.
I'm totally convinced that you need a centralized service like circle to have any chance at mass adoption. There's a reason most people don't hoard their cash/assets and personally manage their security. It may not be smarter, but it sure is easier and what people are used to.

How do you think they are making those purchases now?  Smh.This isnt a huge market, man. You're missing the forest for the trees.
What you mean to say is "When Bitcoin acceptance is ubiquitous enough that even 13 year olds want to use it to make transactions, adoption will be on the rise and price should follow".
You're acting like 13 year olds allownace money is going to push the price up (thats actually exactly what you said), which is absolutely ridiculous.

Or because bitcoin is literally incapable of being used as an everyday currency in its current form.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:33:09


No, it hasn't changed at all, and that is the problem. The network is so backed up that fees are $5-$15 per transaction, and confirmation times are hours to days.
Point is, most coffee shops/bars that take bitcoin accept zero confirmation payments. They just wait until the transaction hits the mempool (almost instantly) and then trust the buyer isn't going to double spend the money. 
Sooooo BTC cannot be used for the entire reason it was created (A trustless network to verify transactions) 
So the fanatics here expect everyone to pay a $5-$15 fee on something they want to buy, and THEN they expect the merchant to *trust* that I am not a bad actor and will not rip him off.
Clearly, this is retarded.
@_date: 2017-05-29 20:35:06
This was from an exchange to one of my hot wallets (I use to pay for my VPN and other miscellaneous things), and those 7 inputs are all multisig addresses. So you're right, the size was large, but I actually didn't know what the size was going to be before I sent it (you set the fee beforehand, and I guess the exchange just gives you what they give you?).
Also, I would anticipate the bitcoin transactions all having larger numbers of inputs (and size) timeline into infinity. Some transactions decrease the entropy (like mine shown takes 7 inputs, down to 2), but I think more complexity is created than destroyed. 
So yeah, should have attached a $16 fee. That's not outrageous or anything. We don't have anything to be angry about at all.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:46:01
I understand what that means, buddy. It came from an exchange and those 7 inputs are multisig addresses, so that's why the size is so large. I did not know the size before I entered the fee (the exchange just gives you what they give you I guess). I didn't "Make 10x the size transaction with only 5x the fee, what did you expect". 
Regardless, it is still totally unacceptable. 
I don't care what you do. Make some more BTC purchases at $10 fees, whatever you want to do. Have a good time.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:32:24

Wew, yeah man. What an opportunity they are missing out on. Right now they are using cash, which is accepted everywhere and between all groups of their friends, when they COULD BE using crypto, which is accepted nowhere!
Plus, since they dont have bank accounts, they cant cash out the crypto for something useful! 
WHAT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. This was the perfect use case, I cannot believe I hadnt thought of it before.

Yes there is a fee for that, and the fees are HUGE right now. It makes it completely unusable.

Bitcoin is worse than the traditional banking system now.

I'm not all that hopeful that it happens any time soon.
Miners are being greedy as fuck, and as long as us assholes continue to throw thousands of dollars per bitcoin at the market, what incentive is there for a change?
It makes me extremely frustrated, and I just do not understand a reason to be super optimistic about the current situation. It pisses me off when people are blindly ecstatic about BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-29 22:24:11
Ah, so you're saying I should have paid a $16 fee. Which is true, if I wanted it included in the next 6 blocks.
It demonstrates how ridiculous the fees and transaction times are.
That is acceptable to you? $16 fees to send $300?
This isn't worth talking about to you? You just want to stick your head in the sand? You don't care that Bitcoin wont change, and clearly is becoming the worse option for the service it was created for?
I don't get it. Everyone with BTC should be pissed off about this.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:22:08


Oh yes, this is way more fucking convenient than the traditional banking system. Where do bars sign up for this bullshit? 
Congratulations, you solved 0 problems, and created 2 more.
Absolutely delusional.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:10:17
You don't understand how this works apparently.
The merchant gives you the beer when the transaction *hits the mempool*, which is almost instantaneous. 
You can double spend that money, and fuck the merchant out of the payment if he doesn't wait for confirmations. And given that confirmations have been taking DAYS (unless you attach a $10+ fee to it), that is a big problem.
So not sure what your point is. Cool. The merchant is at risk using bitcoin. The exact thing bitcoin was supposed to do, it can't: Create a trustless network for verifying transactions.
You're saying, Ehhhh, just trust the guy. Accept the transaction without confirms.
Why the hell would you use Bitcoin then? Zero fucking sense to use Bitcoin for anything at this point.
@_date: 2017-05-29 19:55:17


THAT'S WHAT BITCOIN WAS GOING TO SOLVE. Oh my god, man. lmao.


We all understand that. Jesus christ man. That is not the argument.


Then why use bitcoin?? A trustless network to verify transactions, and you don't wait for confirmations. Literally defeats the entire purpose.


I pay for my VPN every month, buy amazon gift cards, etc. I get a "paid" receipt when it hits the mempool, but am not credited until the transaction receives confirmations. 
I use bitcoin as little as possible. I don't want to use it. Why would I want to pay $10 fees and wait days for confirms?
I know how a bitcoin transaction works. You don't seem to understand that merchants not waiting for confirms defeats the entire purpose, and puts them at risk to double spends (or zero fee transactions, that literally never get picked up and put in a block).
But whatever man, drink the kool aid. I use bitcoin, and it sucks ass to use. It's not even an argument at this point. BTC needs to change or get replaced.

Volatility and yada yada.
Bitcoin literally cannot be used widespread as a currency to replace fiat. Fees and transaction times are too large of a problem.
So you can say the typical "Volatility and government control", but truth is even without those 2 things it's literally not feasible in its current state anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:18:50
So what you're saying is, it's not any better than what we have now. Got it. "It's just a part of doing business!". What about when I sit at the bar and run up a 150 dollar tab? Am I going to sit there for 3 days waiting for confirmations, or are you just going to "Trust" that i'm being honest. Cause, ya know, the vast majority of people are honest, so this is acceptable risk. **You know, kind of one of the things BTC was "supposed to solve"**. A trustless network verifying transactions, but that isnt important to you people anymore I guess.
Dude. Why can you people not admit there are problems right in front of your faces?
I need a way to transfer money anywhere in the world, with a network that verifies transactions that doesnt rely on trust, with reasonable fees and fast transaction times. There is demand for that.
Bitcoin is NOT that. It is fucking NOTHING it promised to be.
It is so frustrating. Use the network dude. After 3 or 4 transactions, you'll be thinking "yeap, this is fucking stupid. How about I use one of the 10 alternatives instead". 
It needs to be fixed. Now. Or it will die.

So wait.... so NOW the argument is that we go back to the way of doing things in the early 90's when people paid with checks, so that we can accommodate bitcoin transactions.
Jesus fucking christ man. I am out. There is no dealing with you people. BTC was supposed to solve all of these problems you are mentioning, and it plain DOES NOT. The mental gymnastics are unbelievable. I'm honestly astounded at you right now.
And yada yada, this is temporary and all that. I've been hearing that for years, and everyone who owns bitcoin should be as frustrated as I am right now. It is total bullshit.
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:35:09
Dude. Transaction fees and confirm times have made bitcoin literally unusable. When was the last time you made a transaction through the network?
And paypal? How about Eth, Monero, Zcash, etc?
Bitcoin doesnt want to change, so it will be replaced. It's too late,  the miners have fucked around long enough being greedy, so no scaling solution has been made. Others learned from BTC's mistakes and fixed them.

Just because you can't fucking do it doesn't mean it is impossible. I'm willing to bet you gave it a go, lost your fucking ass, and rather than say you are personally incapable, you have to jump to it's literally impossible. If can't do something, it MUST BE impossible. How arrogant.
