I was unable to provide the necessary KYC documents to GLBSE when they went down so lost 30 something coins!

TBH it was only worth a few hundred dollars back then and would've cost me more than that to fly home and sort out my documents. Still plays on my mind sometimes though, but what-ifs and if-onlys are a waste of time really.

The one on top is just an extra one that won't be used, made for this photo only ;) They're just public addresses on the outside anyway.

In 2013 I put aside a small amount of coin for a number of family members. That amount is no longer so small - not life changing but not insignificant. So these wallets are now in the post to my home country and will be funded once I know they've arrived safely. Each steel coaster has the seed phrase etched on it and is then sealed in an envelope and then laminated. I had limited resources to make anything where I am but am quite pleased with the end result. Initially I purchased a stamping set and was trying to stamp some steel tags but had much more success using the etching pen. Hopefully they'll clear customs and reach home by Christmas!

It's literally public knowledge that this is their address as it was shared through their own Twitter account as such! Took my 20 seconds on Google to work that out.

Close, Dharamkot is the next village over. I'm getting 4g across most of the area this season and most restaurants have reasonable wifi.
