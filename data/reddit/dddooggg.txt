You mean users mean jack shit since POW Hashes are what matters.

Character assassination. Nice one Rolling Stone. The guy fucked up but smearing him over a silly video he made about apple quiche years ago is intellectually offensive.

That's a ridiculous attitude. You have the stewardship of a highly valuable domain name for the Bitcoin community and industry. You have failed miserably. This website has been up for ages. It's fine if you want to keep it as your own for-profit operation, but there's no excuse to let Bitcoin look like some 2000 dot com scam and just wave your hand to the community when somebody asks you what's up.

You're obviously being the victim of a brigade from our friends over at youknowwhere. Thank you for posting this and spreading the word.

That's actually a very good point. I would fund the bounty for such a project. :)

Oh that's right, the market, the invisible hand, the fairy with a top hat.
See how the free market fixed global warming, pollution, health care.
Leaving everything to "the market" is just institutionalising dementia.

You're just mad your narrative just got rekt by simple facts collected in a post. BitFinex support is laughable and earthtrader just proved it. All you have is some generic PR corporate buzz pitch drivel. oh and don't click the button twice in a row ok???

Sorry but markets are not perfectly efficient as you assume them to be and in reality people taking their money "to another coin" would be a gigantic clusterfuck. If markets behaved as you so naively describe then the whole world would already be using Bitcoin then.

WTF dude, so what we get after months of silence is some kind of seemingly alcohol-fueled depressive cryptic rant. Is Joel bipolar? Get your front-end sorted and we could have a crypto kickstarter. Surely it can't be that hard.

Ok dude. Since the agent in question is not a prosecutor in the case, no problem then.

Lol. sure mate. Ross is a victim, he was played by the FBI to pretend to be DPR. I am so sorry but a US federal agent being a liar does not mean Ross is not DPR. Sorry to burst your bubble.
