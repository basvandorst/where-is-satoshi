An opinion, written as fact, and then posted in an echo chamber. Interesting exercise.
Buying bitcoin over the counter, shorting, then dumping that bitcoin on the market, so collapsing the price. Repeat over and over, until bitcoin's price remains below mining costs. Would this be possible?

Dumpy Trumpy is provoking global warfare, currently against China, Europe, and Iran, possibly under Putin's instructions. This is an opportunity for Bitcoin to show it's superiority over the dollar and gold during a global war.

Bitcoin is only superior because PoW. Once PoS is as secure, the environmnetal destruction caused by Bitcoin becomes pointless.

Decentralise the cryptomarket away from Bitcoin being the main fiat onramp. Work towards 1600+ altcoins as  fiat onramps also, so if governments want to attack Bitcoin, they have to attack all other cryptos individually at the same time.

How long will a project keep the best development team once the individuals of this team realise they are assisting Central Banks through Bitcoin centralisation.

Oil drilling and new exploration is subsidised by printing endless fiat, and so decreases fiat purchasing power. Everyone that holds fiat are funding countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran. 
End fiat and no one will source oil at an energy loss. No oil, no mining. No mining, no minerals for building PoW Miners. No Bitcoin blockchain.
In a post fiat world, holding physical silver is more logical than holding private keys of an extinct blockchain.  
@_date: 2018-07-06 12:10:25
Demand for precious metals isn't fixed. It seems fixed through paper derivatives being dumped on the market. This way the masses don't panic, even when the two largest economies are waring and the collateral damage will effect all global trade negatively.
No such thing as a free market when endless fiat can dump value on all safe haven assets. Bitcoin should be rising rapidly in value right now. Yet it's not.
