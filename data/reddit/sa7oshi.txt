Can I get some data suggesting who the economic majority supports?
@_date: 2017-03-06 13:50:11
It does, 1.7 MB on average judging by the current transactions.
It also allows for 4MB of spam for 1/4 the cost.

Considering bitcoin is standing still the length of the road does not matter. Slow and steady wins the race.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:53:56
Could it be because of the way this sub is "moderated"?
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:32:20
Basically by buying btc-u tokens you are betting that unlimited will fork **AND** that core won't change to stay on that chain. This is why Jihan considers it unfair and he's right.

My point is miners don't want to destroy confidence in the network because their hardware will be worth nothing then, so you won't see this happen.
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:08:53
Bitcoin unlimited is not against lightning network. It is hover against limiting the block size for the purpose of forcing users to second layer solutions. 
All it does is give miners the power to decide the block size without developer intervention, that is all. Whether this is good or bad is debatable but it's intended purpose is not to do everything on chain.

You are wrong, we can and it would be a soft fork like segwit is.

If you throw out test blocks before you have &gt;50% support they are just going to get orphaned. 
The miners have the biggest stake in the future of btc, if you hold bitcoin you can sell quckly but getting rid of mining hardware is not that easy. 
Mining is a long term investment so I trust miners to do what is right for the network. If I didn't trust miners I would have never bought btc.

I don't mean people using bitcoin for whatever purpose, I despise what luke is advocating.
I mean purposefully creating transactions with inflated signature data  for the sole purpose of filling up the chain. Segwit data get's a 75% discount on fees for reasons I don't understand, allowing a malicious person to fill out 4mb blocks for a little bit over 1mb worth of transaction fees.

I watched it all. Didn't see the part about support for B U.

We don't need to massively scale with blocksize increases but having none is suicidal.
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:56:35
How about a definition that can be used to decide which is the real bitcoin in a fork situation?
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:20:42
Anyone care to provide a alternative definition of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:28:32


Oh oh I know. Why don't we raise the blocksize to reduce fees in the immediate term and stop raising it when layer 2 solutions are ready and being used. Eh eh?

He's saying it would take 60 years for all people on earth to open 1 LN channel once in their lives. Doesn't even take into account that closing a channel is also a on-chain transaction.

Because if you are a competent engineer that disagrees you get pushed away, silenced. Try to fight that and this sub will do it's best to smear your reputation.

Quite sure he's talking about Satoshi and Gavin who were the first bitcoin developers who's vision for bitcoin gets dismissed here and is the vision for bitcoin cash.
Bitcoin thought leaders now believe in high transaction fees for the sake of cheap nodes which I find ridiculous. Bitcoin is secure enough with miners and big companies **all over the world** running nodes. It doesn't need average joe to do it. Average joe should use svp wallets and find uses for bitcoin.

JJ does this talk and now Todd and Core &lt;redacted&gt; are all crying about not posting attack vendors before they are patched.... oh the hilarity

I would count Matt as Blockstream seeing how he co-founded the company:

Did you read the comment? 


Obviously Eric believes that segwit2x has the economic support. Here are some numbers for economic support:
If you enable weighting you can see that less than 1% of companies explicitly reject segwit2x.

great counterargument
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:15:40
Silly question. Like:
Why would people need stocks when we already have dollars?
@_date: 2017-09-05 05:19:22
Yes, yes I am. Gavin, Satoshi, me and usually big blockers want big blocks to avoid huge fees. Why do you think big blockers want big blocks?
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:29:47
Are you suggesting people like Greg Maxwell and Peter Todd didn't want a fee market to develop? I can prove otherwise if you like?

So just to be clear core developers are not an entity when becoming  one is decided by a small group of people with commit access (must have 1 commit in bitcoin core to be a core developer) but the miners are when anyone can become a miner?
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:52:35






@_date: 2017-09-12 13:21:27
Who are the people with commit access though? They decide which commits see the light of day.
