Segwit is a soft fork

[Segregated Witness]( is an optional, backwards compatible soft fork within the Bitcoin mainnet that increases the number of transactions per block. Thereby increasing confirmation speed while decreasing transaction fees.
This is accomplished by segregating the signature data (“witness” data) and Merkle tree data (sender/receiver data) of individual transactions into separate data structures. 
Hence the name “Segregated Witness.”
The result is a relative block size increase from 1 MB to 1.8 MB (this increase does not count toward the traditional block size limit of 1 MB).
Activation of the segwit soft fork is optional and backwards compatible with all previous versions of the Bitcoin code. Users who have activated segwit can still send and receive Bitcoin to and from users who yet to do so. 
However, the relative block size increase is only realized when sending from one segwit enabled address to another.

They tend to lock accounts they believe are engaging in illegal activity or may have been compromised and their customer service is slow but their fees are low and they offer BCH.
