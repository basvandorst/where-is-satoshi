I never intended to get rich off of cryptos or bitcoin. It is a hobby site devoted to this emerging asset class. I'm a professional investor specializing in another area, but I do think my experience carries over across asset classes. I've also held bitcoins since 2013 and definitely not someone who ever laughed at Bitcoin. Sorry for the misunderstanding.

I agree. But the media is so focused on how much Bitcoin dropped from its all-time-highs and thinking that 40% is a huge number for Bitcoin. It just ain't so.

Too many young people posting memes. 
1980: Computers are a miracle (about 4 years after Apple formed)
1990: Recession sucks, but this internet thing is pretty interesting. Look, a browser. 
2000: Let's overthrow the old economy, everything will go online!!!!!!!!
2010: Capitalism is dead.
2017: Let's over throw the old economy, Bitcoin is going over $100K!!!!!!!!!!!
2020: Capitalism is dead

As someone who has some market experience dealing with the Chinese government, I think you are way underestimating their influence. They can certainly exert control over HK, and mainland capital flows. A few technically sophisticated people in the mainland will figure it out, but most retail investors won't bother with it. And you need to consider merchant adoption. If the Chinese government declares war, say bye-bye to cryptos seeing any merchant adoption in China. China has already moved to a cashless society, driven by Tencent and Alibaba, so the only use use for cryptos in China is to transfer capital abroad (i.e. bypass capital flows regulation). Obviously the Chinese government will react aggressively to that.

If I have to guess: first the weak hands will get wiped out, then they will complain, then regulators will crack down, frauds will be uncovered, people will get arrested, cryptos will continue to get pressured until all of these negative headlines washes out, then we can continue on the path of recovery. This is a big brush fire that is laying the foundations for the future. Just my 2 cents.

I think innovation using blockchain will benefit the entire ecosystem. There will certainly be a lot of cross fertilization going on.

Why is anyone listening to this guy? Didn't he call a bottom a month ago?

People don't get that banks have the right to refuse to lend you money for any activity. Credit cards are revolving lines of credit. Its just common risk management practice to reign in credit when the borrower is using it for highly speculative investments.

Hey guys, thanks for the up vote. I wrote the article and would be happy to take questions or discuss. Thanks!

That’s not my intention. Any other feedback or suggested topic to cover? Thanks!

I sold a month ago. You know, you can always buy back when the chart stops free falling. I'm waiting for it to find a real support level and start to trend up again. That's when people will get excited again and start pouring money in. The problem is that the massive loss of capital by small "investors" will likely trigger investigations, scandals and more regulation. I expect more negative headline in the near term.
