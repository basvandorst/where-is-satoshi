The real point I was trying to make was the circle jerk part which I've mysteriously seen nobody talking about in this comment section.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:27:28
Also I hope you're kidding and understand my point, because if you don't see what's wrong with everyone in a group agreeing with each other then you're just plain stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:34:07
Also I don't believe in any currency but if I did I'd rather believe in one backed up by a currupt government then one that would no longer exists if there was a CME that hit earth in the wrong way, also I do see the slight hypocritacy in that.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:04:25
So what, that doesn't do anything to my argument
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:01:41
I'm not disagreeing in the slightest I fully agree man it sure if fun a step up is when you like have a twink friend to get in the middle and be the cum dumpster.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:07:18
Well only literal circle jerks they can be fun, unless you have that one friend with a huge cock and you can't concentrate and finish and then after it's over everyone calls you a fag.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:30:03
And what does that have to do with you knowing about Bitcoin in 2013, because thats what you said and I'm not seeing the connections there.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:08:00
Well I mean that in 2013 I thought it was to late.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:04:42
I agree
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:25:33
Good point m8
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:43:53
Well you should probably start by teaching some of your budies some proper grammar, my man.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:37:33
Why not just invest in a new company the profit will be much higher.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:19:39
What housing crash, specificly, are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:35:50
You're only proving my point more and more.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:18:23
Maybe a little
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:39:41
If the us could cause reverse inflation for like 20 year or so I think theyd be able to bring back the backed up by gold thing they used to have before the 70s and then I'd trust it again, well at least more.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:47:33
I would like to make a point about an earlier comment, yes the currencies of the world aren't normally backed up by things but that doesn't mean the answer is to just created another system where its also not backed up by any other than faith that other people will still want to get it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:09:34
Here's some I think will be interesting, who here cares about the topic of net neutrality.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:40:58
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:13:48
By too late I meant that it's so pricy that a normal person isn't going to by into Bitcoin now when they could have back when that friend was telling them about this cool new currency that you can buy into and see it rise but now that you've seen it go up people see it as something that has come, and has now gone but I know it hasn't I'm not a noob and I wasn't attacking anyone.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:24:03
I feel like anyone who puts all thier befiefs in something are extremely, and I don't use this word often, retarded in every sense of the word. I am not certain btc will fail but I think it probably will if it continues on and becomes the top currency like most believe I don't care good for all you prophets
 we have here.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:07:20
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:59:03
I would like everyone in this comment section to say when they learned about Bitcoin and bought into it that will probably explain what I meant by "too late".
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:07:00
I don't think it's a big deal about when you learned about it really I think it's more important when you put money into it, also I've known about it for longer than any post so far so keep the circle jerk coming.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:51:24
Yep that sure I'd fun just kinda sucks you gotten do it with other people I wish there was a way I could do it myself because then I wouldn't have to look at everyone else. If you don't get it I'm make fun of the metaphorical circle jerk people.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:28:19
I don't use currency bud.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:08:54
Not really, how are you?
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:17:30
That's not what I meant I meant I was and am to poor to be investing my money into shit.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:59:49
Also that's to this comment section you have proven my point about the circle jerk.
