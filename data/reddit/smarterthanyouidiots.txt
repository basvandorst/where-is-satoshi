——— economics cannot be viewed by only one of its components. It must be viewed in a bigger scenario. Bitcoin is somehow harming the health of a country's economy. Why? Bitcoin uses  decentralized currency system. It will lose the functionality of centralized banking system which kickstart more profitable and income generating investment that will lead to livelihood of many people.

It is  not about scaling issue dude. The chart is right. Let me explain, at first people is getting to know bitcoin and then it spreads out like a fire. Then, it is exhausted and becomes a dust. So, how can we expect that it will continue to go up when people's real money is limited? Who will give the higher price when no one else can afford it. They will say it will reach 2,000  usd. Who will buy it? No one because not everyone is billionnaires right? The truth is the money earned from this is from the loss of some people hard  earned. Think twice.

You cannot say secure if someone can see your key. This is visible at the backend and SQL tables. It can be decrypt as it can be encrypt.

Citizens of the world, banking system is very important in a country's economy. They gathers people's money savings to be invested into more profitable businesses that Leads to more jobs and livelihood for many people to survive.
If people will stop putting their money in the banks because they will keep it in their virtual wallet (where actually their paper bills are in the hands of anonymous person to be used for whatever he can as he pleases) there will be no fund for the new income generating or Livelihood projects for the people. The result will be unemployment, poverty and starvation. Think twice before jumping in to put your trust into this new bitcoin services.
