I hope that Tether understands the importance of consistency in the way they operate.
And what this rephrasing of their definition of transparency really means for them.
  
What makes me even more curious is the news from yesterday that Tether [re-opened]( their Fiat deposits/witdrawals for new users.
In late 2017 I noticed that it wasn't possible to make an official Tether account, so you couldn't deposit fiat or withdrawal Tethers into fiat.
For months Tether showed the message on their sign up page that is was "temporarily" not possible to sign up for a Tether account.
What I'm curious about is why now?
Tether [says](
"Now, thanks to stronger banking as a result of our new relationship with Deltec, Tether is able to return to its original vision of having a wallet for creating and redeeming directly on its own platform without having to rely on a third party. This update allows the immediate withdrawal of Tether to fiat (1:1), with the ability to acquire coming soon."
This could be true, but timing and Tether go hand in hand the past has shown. And now when the crypto market is at his weakest the effect of this has yet to be seen.
They also said:
"... and with alternative stablecoins entering the market, Tether has maintained its stablecoin market domination, but naturally differentiated, with heavy adoption amongst professional investors."
What I also noticed is the quick rise of certain alternative stablecoins these last few weeks and it's in Tether's interest to hold on to the domination that they already have. I won't expect that Bitfinex will ever add a stablecoin pair that isn't related to Tether.
