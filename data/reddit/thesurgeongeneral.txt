I feel like $700 = 1btc would be prime time for myself. Maybe even $1k if I fall into some cash

Thanks for that! Sadly I need to learn much more + reformat my comp with a legit version of windows before I even create a wallet in case my comp. has been compromised with anything malicious.

Def not trolling. It's just my personal decision. It's probably a bad one but it's mind none the less. I just couldn't see my self pumping $9000 into something intangible atm. But who knows what the future holds.

Your replies have just sent me down the rabbit hole.... might just be on board after a few more information videos.

holy shit.... guess I'm not playing the Witcher 3 this weekend. lol, Thanks a bunch!

This is true. Perhaps I'll look into it. Did just get a raise. Maybe allocating that into bitcoin would be a wise move.

He said "I don't even care" over 5 times in the first 30 seconds of speaking.... 
Something tells me he cares... a lot.

When I hear communism I think North Korea. 
When I hear people defend communism I giggle.

Isn't this how regular money  works except that it's been around so long that the spikes are slower-ish?
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:39:38
The federal reserve is NOT owned, governed, controlled, cooped. etc, by the government.   
The federal reserve is a private / independent central bank and its monetary  policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government.

Want some side step with your side step? 
Because this time we've side stepped your side step with a side step.

If someone asks you for money in the form of a loan. At what point are they ever able to give / take power away from you?
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:01:11
The correlation you're drawing between capitalism and government isn't accurate. And that's okay. Just don't bring it up in public. Or just change your perspective.

Read all the rules and hit the post button!
@_date: 2019-05-07 01:22:42
lol oh ya? 
The point was the loaner of said money always has the power.

Why not both? 
You seem to think that government is uninfluenced. And/or has all the power. I'm telling you the bank has this power and manifests said power through the federal reserve. 
The government doesn't secretly control it (they wish they did) wouldn't be worrying about debts if they did.
It's all good. A simple google search does the trick.
(Does the government own the federal reserve?) 
Boom. Infinite sources on why they don't. Yet no one seems to be referring to your personal view. Crazy how that works. Prolly all part of the conspiracy though.
This is the part where you either A. Move the goal post B. Delete comment. C. Admit you're wrong. Admittedly, I'm betting big on option  B imho.

Analogies are best used through simple &amp; universal topics. Just for futures sake. 


Whoa wait a minute. That's the opposite of what you've been saying. Now you're agreeing with me. 


I agree.

As if you actually thought that was a real statistic. .. well maybe...
I'm so over this convo lol We're on the same side, but arguing over minutia. Banks / federal reserve = bad. Whether or not it's run by the government (it isn't) , doesn't change much of anything.
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:24:23
I too like to side step objective facts when arguing.

It's an empirical fact documented to death.
Please show me your proof that the government controls the federal reserve.
I find it SUPER ironic that you see me as the "sheep" in this convo considering the plethora of conspiracy theories surrounding the federal reserve and it's secrecy / privacy.
I feel like you may have misspoke / misinterpreted something and now you've come too far to admit being wrong so you're turning the topic into some sort of intro to linux 101 in order to seem superior. Which is needless to say   
SUPER fukn cringe.
