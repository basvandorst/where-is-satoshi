Also (unless this was explained to me wrong) verifying blocks doesn't become more difficult as more bitcoin are mined, but as the hash rate of the network increases (usually by having more miners connect to the network). This way you'll always have a new block roughly every 10 minutes.

"Why use bitcoin these days? ... It's volatile"
It's always been volatile.
"Value is [dropping] for some time now"
From €215 to €230 in the last month. Volatile, but not dropping to the ground in the slightest.
"Exchanges are playground for dirty manipulative speculation"
Like all other currencies? Though the more people adopt a currency the less it's possible to manipulate it (unless you announce on world wide TV that the value will drop.  Because then people will believe that, sell and cause the dip in value themselves).
But honestly, why use bitcoin these days? For the same reason as in those days; it has the potential to become this amazing world wide thing and the more people use it the closer we are to that.

Due to the way how btc works. In order to spend then, you need to prove you have them (wallet software does this for you).
Say I got 1 BTC from someone. There is now a transaction on the blockchain saying my address has received 1 BTC. If I now spend 1 BTC the wallet attaches that transaction to this new one as proof (which marks that old transaction as 'spend').
Or in a slightly more complicated example. You got 0.5 BTC twice and spend 0.75 BTC. Both old transactions are added by your wallet software, now you have 1 BTC outgoing, but only 0.75 BTC goes to someone else. So another transaction is added; 0.25 BTC to yourself (this new transaction is of course 'unspend').
So as long as your wallet software uses &gt;1 year old transactions as proof, the check can be done by simply looking at the transaction itself.

Only skimmed the article but I noticed this;
“There are two elements here: the blockchain technology itself [and the] bitcoin the currency,”
Not really. The blockchain doesn't get new entries and thus doesn't work without bitcoin and bitcoin can't function without the blockchain.
In practice they're the same thing. The wonderful extra things like Proof of Existence are available in the blockchain through bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:37:23
Those transactions will all be available, but in order to prove those wallets, or specifically addresses (as you can have a single wallet client create multiple addresses) are yours you may have to create new transactions with each in between address.
Much more inconvenient for you, but still irrefutable proof that these coins are as old as you say they are and haven't changed hands.

It's difficult by design. Proof of work.
The network need to solve 1 block every 10 minutes on average.
If there were only 2 computers in The network, each with 1 hash every 2 minutes, the difficulty had to be extremely low so that it'll only take (on average) 10 guesses.
With the millions of computers performing trillions of hashes per second, difficulty had to be pretty high. Again, so that, on average, it takes 10 minutes to solve a block.
@_date: 2015-12-14 14:10:07
Good point actually. I believe the difficulty is adjusted (roughly) every 2 weeks (or every 2016 blocks)?
Admittedly, every currency gets problems if suddenly the majority of people stop using it, but this particular problem is cryptocurrency specific.

If you have a wallet app on your phone you don't need to send them anywhere. Use the app to pay with bitcoins.
Coinbase is an exchange so (even if bitcoin's idea wasn't that it's decentralized and no reliance on banks and the like) you want to keep as few bitcoins in their wallets as possible.
@_date: 2015-08-28 18:19:39
Not per se. A single flaw in their API or website and everyone loses their bitcoins. You can actually add pen and paper security to your own. A company might be forced to surrender all bitcoins (or just yours) by the government.
And, the whole idea is to be independent from financial institutions like banks; be the owner of your own money. With bitcoin you can, because you don't need the bank's services to wire money to someone.
In the end, security wise, nothing is perfect. But I prefer bitcoin's trustless system as it's objectively a better one.

It's true that it's a lot easier to spend bitcoin if your income was already in bitcoin, but that's true for everything. I'm not spending much ¥ because I'd have to get them first to then spend them, but it still happens.
That the CEO got tricked sucks, but as they explain in the article itself; this is just like cash. And many of the countries I've visited are pretty cash heavy.

Ah I see. Yeah then, while using only the blockchain, you can't connect the two wallets, you hardly 'anomynize' your BTC.
I've only seen one bitcoin ATM, it's one in Amsterdam near me by Lamassu. Theirs don't have cameras and there's no verification step (in fact, in looking this up, seems like a lot of the Dutch ATMs are by Lamassu and require no IDing).

Not at all. Say I can buy 1 loaf of bread with 1 satoshi. Next we all agree on an update that allows us to go to 0.1 satoshi. How would this be a problem?
I'd still need 10 mini-satoshi or 1 satoshi for the loaf of bread. Nothing is lost.

And here I thought the "free parking" and "railroad" house rules were questionable..
Why would you ever agree on not buying anything on the first round? Also, loans? For what reason do you think you can turn your property back-side-forward?
Strangely enough, I knew that railroad rule was a house rule, but that was because we decided before each session if we'd use it or not. That the bank is supposed to auction a property off if someone landed on it and didn't buy it however.. Learned many things today.

Depends on a few things. Who is investing, what is understanding?
If 'investing' is everyone that uses it, probably not too many. Though a lot of the maths involved is already used in online banking, just to a lesser degree (just for verification and to set up the secure connection).
If understanding is just things like knowing what a hash is than maybe quite a lot of people 'understand' the maths involved.
Actually, the maths involved isn't hard per se. When your private key is used with other things to create your signature for that transaction it's a relative simple set of rules that you follow. When you check a signature it's a relative simple set of rules that the signature has to adhere to. When 'miners' try to solve a block, they're literally just trying every random string of characters the PC can think of.
The concepts used have been around for quite a while and have been used before, this particular combination happens to create a robust and secure decentralized ledger system.

I think we can all agree that it's those regulations that stopped bitcoin from becoming easily adoptable and wide spread in the first place. So he's just talking out of his ass here.
Then he talks about the mistakes made with bitcoin as if this was somehow bitcoin's fault, again, ass talk.
But the rest of the article doesn't actually tell me why it's time to buy bitcoin. In fact, he concludes with bitcoin has had a rough ride and we know nothing of the future of bitcoin so it might remain a wild ride...
Am I missing something from this article?
@_date: 2015-02-16 02:00:27
This ignores Bitcoin mining, a surprisingly boring and (depending on your perspective) temporal thing.


In essence, Bitcoin is a ledger system. A decentralized, public ledger. It keeps track of every single (Bitcoin) transaction that ever was. To explain this, let's assume you have 2 wallets and neither have enough to buy what you want.
The thing costs 15 BTC, you have Wallet A with 7 BTC and Wallet B with 10 BTC. So you decide to transfer everything from Wallet A to Wallet B. To do this, you have to prove to the network that you can actually pay for the transaction.
The software of Wallet A finds all transactions it can to fulfil the 7 BTC requirement and finds a 1 BTC, a 3 BTC, a 2 BTC and another 1 BTC transaction all going from someone to Wallet A. Together with the transaction to send 7 BTC from Wallet A to Wallet B and your signature this is presented to the network.
The network sees that you have the 7 BTC required and marks the 4 transactions used as proof as 'spend'. Then, 1 to a few confirmations later, 17 BTC is in Wallet B.
Now let's look at the next situation. You have 17 BTC (in the form of an earlier 10 BTC transaction to Wallet B and the 7 BTC transaction from just now) in Wallet B. You enter 15 BTC to be paid and your wallet software starts looking. But it only finds the 10 BTC and 7 BTC transactions, too much. So it does the following; it provides those two transactions as proof, but instead of one 15 BTC to the store, there's a second 2 BTC transaction from Wallet B to Wallet B. It get's signed and the network checks.
Since you provided a total of 17 BTC as proof and are spending a total of 17 BTC, this checks out and the provided proof transactions are marked as spend. 15 BTC goes to the store and 2 BTC is send back to Wallet B.
Say you've decided to buy something else for 2 BTC, your wallet software can point towards the 'change' transaction (17 BTC - 15 BTC = 2 BTC as change) to prove you have 2 BTC. That then would be marked as 'spend' and you 'have 0 BTC in Wallet B'.


The Bitcoins are hidden in plain sight, in the ledger of the Bitcoin network. They are the unspend transactions that every public address has.

Isn't the idea of Bitcoin that you don't store your bitcoins with someone else?
It's like buying a DIY kit and then going to a professional with it... Your missing the point (though the professional is probably more reliable). I'm have a bit of trouble feeling sympathy for the unfortunate people who got robbed.
Leave only small amounts of bitcoin on accounts that you don't control yourself.
@_date: 2016-05-22 09:06:57
To explain; For every transaction you make you have to prove you have the bitcoin to pay for it. To do this you grab a previous incoming transaction, use the full amount and give yourself the change.
Example: You have a transaction where your mom gives you 2 btc. Now you want to spend 1 on pizza, do you make a new transaction where you add the previous as proof. In this new transaction 1 btc goes to the pizzeria and 1 btc is send back to you.
This way the next time you want to spend 1 btc you can prove you have it by pointing to that transaction.

If you give me that string of characters I have a copy of your private key; your signature. I can then 'prove' to the network that I am you and start spending your Bitcoins. Easiest would be to create a transaction from your wallet to mine, effectively stealing your Bitcoin.

Not a program, a protocol. You can program your own bitcoin wallet program. Your own node. Etc.
And while an individual's PC or program may be hacked, the entire network is a lot harder.
The idea of Bitcoin is that it's distributed, not one part is in control, but all of them are together. So you need to control a significant portion of the entire network to do malicious things to the network instead of to just one person's wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:57:09
You can't steal Bitcoin, what you can steal however, is your private key. This long 'random' string of characters is used to prove that you are who you claim you are. It's (for the purpose of this explanation) your digital signature.
So when this is from your own bitcoin wallet, someone gained access to your PC, found your wallet file (which was probably not encrypted) and extracted your key from it.
When this is from a website that allows you to store bitcoin, obviously they were hacked. Access was gained to their database (or maybe active memory, I'm sure someone can explain the intricacies of hot wallets and the like better than me) and gained the private key this way.
Lastly, maybe you stored a paper wallet somewhere and it was stolen there.
All answers boil down to this; someone besides you now has your private key for that particular wallet.

I can only go by the preview provided by Amazon, but this book looks disappointing.
He goes to a convention to learn more about Bitcoin and learns of 'enthusiasts' of (in his words) bitcoin instead. Missing the point of his own journey.
He calls Satoshi brilliant and then says he conjures money from thin air like a rabbit from a hat. Not realizing that things start small and need to grow.
Somehow the concept of proof of work is too complex for 8 year olds. All the while talking about the beauty of Satoshi's work.
I think the author did try to understand, but never managed to look past his own bias (again going on the first two chapters provided by Amazon) and ended up producing a lacking and condescending book.
