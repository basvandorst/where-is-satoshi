Too little too late

My thoughts exactly, many adults don't even have 10k saved up... either he has a rich family or he earned it himself (less likely)

Well just for info buying dips is actually the best way to make profit and gain more BTC.

They don't have HQ it's a fake address look yesterday's post about someone going there
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:45:43
Good luck !!!

Yea mate I don't care since when you've been hodling, doesn't mean anything in this context except your personal gains, good on you. The matter of the fact is Bitcoin has never been this popular or recieved this high amount of popularity. It also hasn't seen more than ~50% drops since it gained that traction. And there have never been more Alts to trade with Bitcoin as a sub-currency to the dollar. All of these help bitcoin to have lower % drops. Comparing BTC from pre-2014 (and even after) to btc in 2017 especially 2nd half of 2017 isn't quite the same. It's like comparing a mouse to an elephant and saying they both eat the same amount of food. If you're waiting for an 80% drop you probably won't be buying anytime soon unless some catastrophic news come out.

Can't find it sorry :/ maybe someone else can link it
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:27:53
No BTC will not drop 80-90% keep on dreaming. Max 30-40% is what you can hope for. But it's pretty stable over 15k atm.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:52:22
Thank you for doing this. Incredibly generous, spreading a good message for Crypto as a whole :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:53:42
A wild newcomer has been spotted 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:08:30
Lost* ffs
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:15:15
It may not ever rise up, but that is extremely unlikely and even less likely after a dip. That's why it's the best time to buy because after the dip ends the prices usually goes up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:30
RemindMe! 100 days
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:50:29
Tell me how the price will drop by 80-90% to 3400/1700 usd by this logic ?
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:17:58
True, reminds me of that picture of two guys climbing a pyramid with 90  degree tall steps (like walls) one struggles and sweats while the other one uses money to make steps out of money amongst the tall walls between steps to get to the top easier.

Well I found out about bitcoin a few weeks ago, and after hours of research I decided I am not going to divide my savings into stocks (was thinking about buying Samsung mostly as a long term investment), but rather bought into Bitcoin as I think it's  better for the longterm. I mean look at how many people are against it and it just keeps on growing. Also in the time Samsung's stocks double in value Bitcoin will probably 4x or even more ... I mean the road to 10k,25k,50k doesn't seem impossible or far away. The thousands of daily articles and attention that is increasing every day aren't looking to stop anytime soon either. At the end of the day though, as many investments are I took the high risk high reward path :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:21:08
I can login, not sure if I can purchase though 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:48:17
I meant -600$ as in price per 1BTC I bought 0.14, as much as my savings allowed :) And yea I didn't lose, the ones who lost are the ones panic selling when it dips lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:33:20
Cheers mate
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:27
I'd suggest just waiting for the issue to be resolved, it even says the support is getting too many requests :/
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:45:41
Me too I only had money for .1 but the satoshis were in my wallet after 3 minutes :D
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:21:20
Lol celebrating 38% to 40% after falling from 70%
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:37:59
I am currently taking the most difficult highschool in my country (gymnasium) maintaining good grades while doing Photoshop part-time and exercising regularly 4-5 times a week running/going to the gym so I don't really have any time left to do another part-time job, but that is good advice, appreciate it :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:03:28
I don't regret anything as I never had a computer untill a few years back I barely knew what the internet was so I consider myself quite lucky to find out about BTC at this time.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:31:00
Thanks man I hope yours too :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:23:04
If you dig the tech then why don't your do a bit of research on Nano ?
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:10:16
I wish but it isn't looking likely :/
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:58:08
That is correct :)
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:02:58
Read the FAQ, BTC is Money ;)
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:50:41
Eh I know I put all my money into it already, however I'm not putting my health at risk because of it. Just not worth it even if I would earn a billion, health&amp;family 1st. I haven't been sick for a year now as well, when previously when I was a skinny lazy guy I was sick all the time. Not quitting exercising for another part-time job is what I'm trying to say, I don't think I would be able to handle it anyways without exercising. I do fully agree that you have to put something up close to the top of your priority list if you want to succeed in it though.
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:31:10
True :D
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:51:38
I know but the thing that blows my mind is you could get 1BTC with a crappy laptop pretty easily in the early days of BTC :)
