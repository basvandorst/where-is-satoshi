@_date: 2018-01-25 23:08:07

@_date: 2018-01-05 12:25:18
It’s closing in on 16k. Once it has consolidated above 16k it will go at the next hurdle.
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:46:26

Yeah between Monday and Wednesday 
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:11:20
No. Different sellers will provide it as a payment option. U just choose it as payment method eg. Buying a coffee or anything. Other sites will offer lightning transfers to people etc. Etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:09:39
I’m Ready folks. May satoshi be with you.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:26:13

Great. Now how long til every business can implement lightning with his?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:47:53
It’s a secondary layer to btc. No new coin. It will make transactions almost instant and free again.
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:14:25
Good read. I would guesstimate that Bitcoin reaches 1 Tril market cap around end of 2019.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:51:12
Wow this dude gets it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:00:41
Bitonic.nl I heard is super fast 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:10:34
Where do I find such chart?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:13:31
Coinbase has higher fees.
1,5% vs 0,25
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:52:32
I don’t mind 
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:26:38
Gdax sell wall at 18k is only 300btc now
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:18:18
That’s great! I love Bitcoin and I love this! To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:57:58
Don’t change a running system. Don’t go to Ltc unless it has shown constant growth similar to bitcoin over longer time period. Bitcoin is king for now and will attract most investment for some more time.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:12:13
Sell walls are big sell orders at a certain price, like let’s say 1000 btc at a price of 18k. So for the price to pass 18k it would have to buy through 1000btc which takes a while and ensures the price stays below 18k at least for some time.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:40:06
Boatloads huh 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:14:38
Kraken is good for low fees. Takes a couple of days to set up though. If u want it fast go to coin desk but u pay more especially for credit card.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:45:52
No. The sender will pay fee. Right guys? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:21:49
Well transaction fee will be higher when he transfers from coinbase instead of gdax or not?
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:49:16
Yeah it was hitting the 18k wall for a week
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:07:03
Yes until we hit more than 1% adoption we are very early adopters.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:10:04
Don’t sell. HODL with us to the moon my friend or count yourself among the thousands of fallen eternally regretting their early demise.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:42:20
Lol they scared
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:49:22
Hodl 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:22:19
Yo. I also made my dad invest 5k. Lol. I think I made him hodl a lil longer but he wants out too. Maybe I should do the same as you if he does.
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:06:01
So the banks are working again in Europe after 4 days break I expect a fiat deposit today as I think thousands of others do. Expect a bit of influx and volume today.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:25:41
Oh OK then �� 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:03:28
This is a bot 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:50:37
We’re back to that now
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:48:48
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:45:53
Voting system! 100%
Imagine being able to vote on every issue yourself from your phone, no more politicians no more parties, not like that, no more big money funding presidential campaigns.liquid direct democracy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:03:36
Ok thanks. Why is the price fluctuating now on Coinbase even though it’s not being traded ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:37:56
They secretly opened their platform for bcash and misteriously word got out beforehand so some whales was buying in anticipating a rise in price and making lots of schmoney 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:45:39
Why at 9am
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:21:48
Gotta work on your faith in game brohnson.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:38:09
Nice bro. 30k by tomorrow seems a bit illusionary though lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:34:37
+ 256 Satoshi 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:59:30
What happens when bch /btc starts trading because the price is already so much lower...what will happen to the buy and sell orders at the higher price?
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:23:59
Yes it's worth it mucho
@_date: 2018-09-11 10:41:23
Not with that attitude 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:43:17
It dropped to 2.5k
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:27:49
What you guys think of Tom Lee and Metcalfe’s law explaining 94% of bitcoins price curve?
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:52:26
That means Coinbase too?
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:53:53
I will buy one 1HuquHb1KS6db6zpPrKxGQNwuXbLkS2owA
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:56:40
Kraken has low fees but it takes a while to get verified and bank transfers also take a while, so just buy there now, it will be worth it because your returns will make up for the waiting when u buy now.
@_date: 2018-09-06 11:49:46
I like how the mouth doesn’t get bigger on zooming in but even smaller still
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:16:43
Guys, coinbase is adopting segwit in a few weeks, lightning main net hit 500 nodes and growing exponentially doesn’t that mean that Bitcoin is going back to being fast and cheap? This itself should make the next wave bigger right?
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:33:07
Yea. Well from coinbase 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:36:27
We’re there
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:16:08
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:09:11
I will sing a song for you if you donate btc to me
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:18:37
Not only that but also to give the force of hodling to the newbies that are easily shaken. When we stand strong in the storm we shine the light of true hodling and empower others thereby creating the miracle of the green candles. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:15:18
Happy Valentine’s Day Bitcoin. Thank you for your nice gift. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 09:23:58
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:55:51
Im thinking euros.
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:09:15
Who would have thought that Bitcoin could recover from a 70% drop after it has only done that a couple of times before?
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:10:16
Fourth time is the Charme I hope
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:06:50
Volume is high and increasing though.
