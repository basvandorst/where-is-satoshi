I don't doubt that crypto has some utility snd will  be  useful  soon, the question is about its value. Right now, the largest crypto is useless as a medium of exchange for sums less than thousands of dollars.
I believe in the tech, but it is certainly over valued. I'd say more than 70 or 80 percent of the fiat value of crypto is there purely because it goes up in value. If it stops going up in value it loses its primary utility and so causes panic.

If the market crashed entirely, and you had an ounce of gold, at least you have an ounce of gold. Make a necklace, a ring, or some electronics. it's a nice item. Can we say the same of BTC? The market crashes, and all you have is a private key.

I'm comparing to apple purely to illustrate how inflated it is.

In December it hit 750 billion. Which is comparable to the largest companies in the world.

The debate in my mind has always been, 'when is this gonna pop'. I've known it's a bubble all along, but you can make money in a bubble. Do we *really* think that bitcoin is worth $18,000……? On what grounds is it worth that? The only reason people want it is because it goes up in value. It doesn't have any utility outside of very niche use cases.
Crytpto has a future, but it has been inflated for a long time. It's like dot com, the people hailing it as the future of everything were right, but a lot of people lost a lot of money in the initial excitement.

Great. Now we only have to solve the huge price upswings and people might buy coffee with it. Why buy a coffee for $3 of BTC if by next week that same amount of BTC is worth $4…?

But you don't have 100,000,000 USD in the bank do you ? USD is relatively stable and very spendable. If you have that much in BTC it can drop to nothing in a couple of weels. It's only utility is that it goes up in value.

A tiny market? Have you seen the proposed value of all the crypto available right now? It's bigger than Apple. Sometimes you need to step outside of your immediate circle to get a fresh perspective. You're thinking about it purely as a medium of exchange, in which case you're right, it's hardly got a market share at all. But its primary use right now is as a 'hodl' investment, ie, it's being bought purely because it increases in value. When that use case dries up, people panic. Did you buy your coins purely so you can exchange value for things easily and without government interference ? Or did you get them because you expect they will rise in value? Which of those two camps do you think most people fall into?
For the argument that crypto replaces fiat, for that to be so, it needs to stabilise in value of it's impossible for it to become a useful medium of exchange. Absent that single utility, what is it for?
Perhaps the best argument I can think of is, it's a long term storage of value. Which is fine. We may get to a point where bitcoin becomes like the Amazon S3 of value, at which point it's price will stabilise. But with all the competition it faces, there's no reason to think that any of 'it' will continue to increase in value, because guess what, despite their being a BTC cap, there's an endless supply of blockchain space. The cap is arbitrary, and any slack will be taken up with cheaper competition.

Yes it's called intrinsic value. For all the throwing round of ideology in here there's some pretty basic misunderstanding. BTC is the means to get wealth. Not the wealth itself.
If it crashes (like the Zimbabwean economy did) it becomes worthless. It has no intrinsic value. Exactly like Fiat money.
If I invested it in a house, and then the housing market crashes, even though I lose 'value' on the house, at least I have a house.
The difference in intrinsic value is usually the difference in price. Hence an ounce of gold is $1300 and a house is $130,000.

I think you made the very point I am making. It's over valued. You said it your self.
