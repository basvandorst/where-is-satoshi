I totally agree with you. Even further, I think that for this kind of "Mass adoption" service to really take off, an all free business model is the most suited. Like tweeter, reddit, snapchat the "free" effect is nowdays very valuable.

Oh ok, so you'd send an OTP code, for each withdraw, in order to accept to do your part in the transaction signature ?

It says that Amazon.com accepts Bitcoin for payment which, as far as I know, is not the case... yet
@_date: 2014-03-04 01:36:27
It.

I got it now, clever

From what I understand so far is that it looks a bit like an eBay for Bitcoins only, although eBay does alllow selling your coins as well (without the escrow part). 
I have some questions : as the escrow in the transaction, what are the constraints you impose on it ? Is the medium of payment is up to the buyer and/or seller ? Could you elaborate on the verification procedures you're gona follow when sellers claim not receiving the funds, or when payment cancellations occure after you validated the transaction for example ?

If anyone knows what direction the price will he'd be trading himself, not giving advice in here

Actually that was a joke. Blurry text as any blurry image is lost data

Be careful, I saw in movies that techies are able to rebuild data from blurry images...

But Blockchain.info also does provide two factors auth

It does really look like eBay to me, with an exchange suit on it (ie. buy and sell order book), and with the escrow service (which eBay will quickly follow). But I like the taste of innovation through the multisig/twoAuthPerTransaction. I wish you to get your way before it becomes standard though

I like your logic and pragmatism. When I see how one's opinion and hopes about digital decentralized currencies can fluctuate after becoming a Bitcoin owner, I can't help to think about the snowball effet that could have the entrance of some powerful people in the game.

Any old Android smartphone, reset to factory, with the App Bither and no connectivity. It's cheap (even free as everyone has an old Android laying around), easy to use and understand, and does not need to connect to a computer whatsoever as the transactions to sign as well as the signed transactions are transferred via QR codes to and from the same Bither App installed on your main, unsecure, smartphone.

Well there's no explicit law neither about stealing Bitcoins yet, although wanting a free market does not include accepting this

The taped paper message says "For larger trades please contact ...". What's the trade limit with the ATM then ?
Edit: Btw I don't think the machine looks ghetto at all, I kinda love the yellow simplistic design, however That taped paper does not give it a very professional and secure image, specially to newcomers

Any idea on why they did not ?
@_date: 2017-03-02 13:20:36
Any idea why ChangeTip did not take off ?
I mean, from an observer point of view (I never actually tried it), this looks like a killer usage of bitcoin. In today's world, where millions of people live in a tight relationship with their virtual social networks, posts, videos, tutorials, reviews, vlogs, content creation, and, comments... It feels like a perfect pair between those two usages.
I'm very surprised not to see prefixed/suffixed emojis everywhere today

Yeah $239... I don't get it neither, specially when I can get a brand new Galaxy ACE for 49€ on Amazon or equivalent, clean it, install some simple handmade wallet, deactivate all means of connectivity, repackage it, sell this for 99€ and ship thousands of those internationally for free.
However, the PR is impressive, the will seams in the good direction, the free international shipping shines well, and the name... KeepKey. Very fine idea. It could do the trick. Nice work.

As a big EUROPEAN consumer, I tend to apprehend the shipping part of a purchase, specially when shipped from the US. The echo of the "free-shipping-all-included-we-take-care-of-everything" message in a consumer subconscient is heavy for a sale to success. It also helps the company/brand image. It shines

What about a kind of small low cost smartphone with no 3g, no wifi, a low cost tactile screen and a low cost camera to hold your private keys.
You would scan public addresses you want to send bitcoins to, the device would sign the transaction with whichever wallet of yours you want and then displays the QR code of the signed transaction on the screen.
It has no security flaw, the payer doesn't even need to have an internet connection (imagine buying some vegetables in a market during a trip in some exotic location). You could of course back your private key(s) up with a pen/paper or a passphrase or whatever that does not need the device to be connected at anytime to a computer.
I made a from an old Android phone that you could buy now on eBay for 40$. Cheap, easy to use and unbreakable security.

OMG I don't know if their list of "Recent transactions" is exhaustive or not, but if it is, looking at the transactions' timestamps is really depressing. Their service is neat though

The perfect cold storage device :
What about a kind of small low cost smartphone device with no 3g, no wifi, a low cost tactile screen and a low cost camera to hold your private keys.
You would scan the QR code of the address you want to send bitcoins to, the device would sign the transaction with whichever wallet of yours you want, and then display the QR code of the signed transaction on the screen. Any smartphone with an internet connection scanning this QR code automatically sends the transaction... done.
It has no security flaw (Neither has Trezor, but here, with no cable wathoever, the zero-flaw security is "visible/obvious"). The buyer doesn't even need to have an internet connection (imagine buying some vegetables in a market during a trip in some exotic location). You could of course back your private key(s) up with a pen/paper or a passphrase or whatever that does not need the device to be connected at anytime to a computer.
I bought an old Android phone for 40$ on eBay and made that work in less than a day using javascript. Cheap, easy to use and unbreakable security.
I don't know if $1.5M is enought to start this kinda hardware business but for some company already in the place with easy access to those old and cheap smarphone components that could be a smart path to take.
