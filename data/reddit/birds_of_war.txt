Segwit was shoved down the community's throat under the guise of Segwit2x is coming later.  Pretty clear now that a blocksize increase is never coming.  If you can't see the writing on the wall at this point you are beyond help.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:52:11
Average fee is approaching $30, and is even higher in the latest blocks.  Am I exaggerating? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 19:33:27
That's not how it works...
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:15:38
Yeah i figured most on here would be libertarian leaning at least 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:33:42
this DEFINITELY happened
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:04:32
Fuck off with your euros you scared me 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:41:29
Poloniex has a good writeup on the risks, can't link I'm on mobile 
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:45:08
Not really the "war" it's just people who bought only to get the payout.  Happens to stocks on ex-dividend dates as well
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:42:05
are you FUCKING US Mike?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:31:26
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:46:59
getting your bank account approved takes a lot of time with them yeah
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:47:39
So that's awful and all but... uh...
How do I sell my Reddit account?
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:26:42
@_date: 2017-08-03 04:09:36
What exchange did you manage to dump on and what did you pull in?
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:42:17
Lol fuck jack Dorsey 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:44:01
yeah they do
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:31:33
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:22:31
I'm lending on poloniex too, on purpose.  Interest rates have been insane... have all my bitcoins out at a 2.7% average daily rate.
Imo that guaranteed profit beats having to race against everybody else to dump bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:35:38
Well it was for the last few days lol.  Under normal circumstances you can get .05-.1% for bitcoin.  Still very good
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:22:51
was there a news catalyst?  Can't find anything
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:21:24
@_date: 2017-08-03 03:38:13
It was insanity... closed some at 4.9%/day.  Still have most of them open too.  Not sure if the borrowers are holding until its clear whats happening with bch or if poloniex shenanigans is stopping them from closing.
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:06:24
nice try Bitfinex shill
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:04:48
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:43:51
I know it drops the value of the dividend.  Problem is there is no clearly defined value for BCH yet
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:57:34
just use gemini dude
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:23:09
Touched the max of 5% at points 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:24:23
there isn't an analogue for the S&amp;P 500 right now... it would simply be an aggregate of the dollar value of the top coins by market cap.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:29:52
I just lent out on Polo at retarded rates through the fork.  Also lent out some on bitfinex where they distributed BCH to lenders
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:31:12
yeah but I didn't see any red flags in there.  Did you catch any?
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:27:24
I respect how Bitfinex handled it too
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:22:49
Took a week for me 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:26:17
I'm sure bitfinex will once the dust settles 
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:34:08
don't fuck us Mike
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:23:01
Anybody who cares about anonymity already uses monero anyway 
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:34:31
I was able to dump on Bitfinex at $400
@_date: 2017-08-19 22:44:18
Gemini customer support is very responsive, sure they have an answer for you if you open a ticket 
@_date: 2017-08-25 21:18:02
This website is the internet capital of strawman arguments  
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:33:55
hahaha this is an underrated point, could very well be it
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:30:43
This is a good point actually... they aren't scared of a run because they won't let it happen lol
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:39:53
enough of these articles jesus christ
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:42:59
Meh 5% ain't shit 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:28:37
the S&amp;P 500 isn't an exchange...
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:54:08
 nice
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:18:40
If bch funding market is juicy on bitfinex I'll hold and lend.  Otherwise I'm dumping 
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:15:54
lol refusing to increase the blocksize = we are under attack
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:16:53
I don't think you know what premined means
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:06:47
jesus christ LISTEN TO YOURSELVES
People want a bigger blocksize!  This isn't a god damn conspiracy.  They are realizing Blockstream will never allow a blocksize increase, and acting accordingly.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:01:21
you've had a bit too much to think
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:31:16
Still less than the amount of USD there would be :)
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:22:29
Interesting, I've thought about it this way too.  Could end up in a spot where bitcoin becomes the electronic form of gold while something like Litecoin becomes digital cash.
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:17:00
For sure, you could argue that over-encouragement of investment caused the last financial crisis in a way 
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:20:26
I've got all of my bitcoin lent out at an average of 2.5% per day right now.  Keep the bitcoin cash, you filthy animals 
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:36:02
WE CAME.
WE SAW.
HE DIED.
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:30:39
Certainly.  I think the more effective argument can be made for a smaller incentive to invest your money vs. save it.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:33:54
sure but that doesn't mean their instantaneous calculation is wrong
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:11:16
Not clear that the increased growth is due to going truly fiat though.  The shift happens to coincide with the early stages of Moore's law, for example.
And defining economic health in terms of GDP is a fiat boondoggle anyway.
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:17:44
Yes it does seem very difficult to deploy correctly 
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:28:26
Yes it did feel very hand-wavy in the moment.  My best argument was that American currency wasn't truly fiat until the 1970s, and we did just fine before that.
@_date: 2017-07-31 22:02:47
Compounding bro 
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:54:13
Are you familiar with Nassim Taleb?  He discusses this in Antifragile as well.  Attempts to bring about artificial stability to naturally oscillating systems exacerbates the downturns.
@_date: 2017-07-12 01:25:24
I was thinking of a hypothetical situation where bitcoin is THE currency.  But it seems more likely to have another crypto fill that role as ebilever mentioned.
It would be interesting to have an inflationary cryptocurrency paired with bitcoin as a store of value takeover the global economy in the future.  You might still have merchants offering discounts for bitcoin in this case since it would only be marginally less convenient than accepting the inflationary currency.  
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:15:36
Yeah Ive got the bot set up for me, it's great
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:25:34
Yeah I have some luck lending BTS for significant rates, but any other alts have terrible lending markets. Even ETH and LTC
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:15:37
If you get a legit, paid-for VPN I wouldn't be worried about that.  One of those sketchy free ones then maybe though
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:26:10
I end up with more bitcoins than I would have just holding.  That's all I care about
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:24:21
You tried using a VPN?
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:15:52
I've got the lending bot working for me and all my loans are for 2-10 days.  Plus I plan on HODLing anyway.
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:39:48
Bitshares is the only one I've had luck lending out.  The rest are shit
