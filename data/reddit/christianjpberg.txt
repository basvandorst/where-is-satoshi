Q3 2019
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:19:17
DTH is a Ethereum ERC20 &amp; ERC223 Token. You can own a Zone by stakeing DTH. A Zone is constantly beeing auctioned thus only people that intend to use it can own it. Its pretty cool.
There is no fees and Dether will become open source soon. Dether is not only an App but also an Crypto2Cash Protocol. Any Business or Dapp can register Sellers/Buyers on the Map and earn 1% Fee on their Trade.
Dether is completely decentralized and is running only on Smart Contracts and IPFS/Swarm and the progressive WebApp cannot be censored.

[dether.io]( $DTH is much better. They are even Listed on Bitfinex/Ethfinex. Its a Cash2Crypto Protocol and noone is able to censor their progressive web app. Its open source, without fees and every dapp can register crypto buyers and sellers on the map while earning a 1% fee for the dappdeveloper. You can list ANY Token or Stablecoin yourself.
