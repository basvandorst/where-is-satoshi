what if we need all of it (sw,lightning,sidechains, ..., AND reasonably increased blocksize), and the longer we wait with a HF the more impossible it becomes (more users, more diverse software running on nodes etc). see the problem there?

That seems very suboptimal. Many packagers prefer this file as it contains things like manpages in the contrib directory. Even debian apparently builds its packages from it ([this]( has the same hash like [this](
    % sha256sum *.gz
    852581d21716b74e0539f7fd2f9c17f5506f1c21c5cec6642b0286823ba97193  bitcoin_0.13.0.orig.tar.gz

I see you already created an issue some time ago for missing files in the release tarball:  If there is no special reason for this, like license problems or something, maybe it would make sense to include atleast contrib/debian in the signed tarball. Then packagers can use this one instead.
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:40:37
Agreed, but I guess you mean ECDSA, I don't think bitcoin itself uses RSA, maybe some wallets use it though.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:04:28
The most simple wallet would be a paper wallet, this is just one address and a privatekey.
A wallet software/app can have many addresses and also does other management things, like calculating the correct transaction fee.
@_date: 2016-08-18 21:22:41
I also had a tx take a few hours today, wallet used was electrum with dynamic fees set to 110% :(
Your fee was probably on the lower end (compared to other transactions at the moment), it will just take longer then.
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:03:48
Is there a way to verify this tarball:  it seems there is no signature. I know I can verify the 0.13.0 git tag, but that does not work with this download. And the [source tarball in the signed release]( is a different one, because it is missing the contrib/debian folder.
@_date: 2016-08-26 21:37:32
There are a few more here: 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:53:05
Coinbase has the privatekey which controls "your" bitcoin. So in that sense you have just a promise of coinbase to pay you x amount of BTC. That does not have to be bad, depends on why you have them there.
If you try to ride the waves and buy/sell often it makes sense to have them there. Or if you receive coins for some product you sell and you regulary cash out to USD on coinbase for example.
Coinbase also has a [Multisig Vault]( where you get one of the privatekeys, but ofc this key needs to be protected and stored very safe (that is the hard part). 
If it is bigger amount and or longterm storage [Trezor]( or [Ledger]( hardwarewallet is a very good option. So far I have never heard of coins stolen from a hardware wallet, so I think this is the best option today.
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:23:47
I would not use a brainwallet, especially after watching this yesterday: 
You could also use something like electrum coldstorage, that is what I used until I bought a Trezor:  - the good thing with this is that you generate one seed, which works different to a standard brainwallet and is harder to bruteforce, and you can sign transactions offline, and you can have a watchonly wallet on your daily system to receive payments/broadcast the offline signed transactions.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:03:37
I don't think they were lying on the website. Seems to me that some people backtracked somehow (I think after it became clear that not everyone would be onboard).
 For example this bitfury tweet: 
 later they were against it...
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:46:44
Nope. Most wallets are HD wallets, that means when you set them up you write down a 12 or 24 word string, with this you can always restore the wallet on a new phone. Same with hardware wallets like Trezor/Ledger they also can be restored like this if the device fails for whatever reason.

I run a public electrum server on a shitty server which often has high diskio and becomes slow. Would use some of the money to upgrade to a beefy machine with ssd and would keep that running for a few years :D
@_date: 2016-04-13 14:42:33
That is true that they are incentivised to upgrade first, but I said for "full effect" everything has to be updated.
Yes all "fullnodes" have to upgrade, even if some do not upgrade, they will get a warning from their bitcoin client like: "Warning: We do not appear to fully agree with our peers! You may need to upgrade, or other nodes may need to upgrade." - So I don't think it is such a big problem as it may seem. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 03:25:19
Not raising the blocksize in a timely manner (like a year ago) probably costed hundreds of millions in marketcap. I can't proof it but I think if for example bip101 would have been adopted price would be higher now and ethereum rally would have been much smaller.
I just hope current path (segwit) makes up for it in the longterm, but I am sceptical to say the least.
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:21:02
Blocksize limit and actual blocksize are different things. It would have taken years to fill 20MB with transactions (like the current 1MB took years to fill up).
We never can be 100% sure, but it is likely that we could process this blocksize in the future (without needing a datacenter).
@_date: 2016-04-02 02:13:02
Most small miners use pools anyway, so depends on what bw the pools can handle. If block is too big there is also risk of orphan blocks, so I don't think it is that easy.
Also blocksize is the smallest centralisation force in mining. Much bigger force is cheap electricity / availability of asic chips.
@_date: 2016-04-13 15:13:12
Nah call me what you want lol, I don't care. I just think this fear is overblown. We have to do it anyway at a point (**if** bitcoin keeps growing, it will need bigger MAX_BLOCK_SIZE, even with segwit, schnorr sigs, lightning) - at least that is my understanding of the situation.
There are gametheoretic things at play here. For example, the miners would only pump out new version blocks in a serious amount if most nodes support it. I think what gavin wrote here is correct:  - risk of real fracture is low imho.
Right now even dogecoin has 10 times of bitcoin transaction capacity, this is undesirable for me as BTC holder. So we have to do something quick in my (idiot) opinion.

Don't use that site OP, it looks like a scam, see [here]( :(
@_date: 2016-04-13 15:58:51
Hmm isn't that what I said. From bitcoin POV there are only nodes and miners. Miners would only generate different version blocks (in meaningful amount) if enough nodes support it. User and exchanges are obv. all connected to these nodes. The miners only finalize things.
If they do this without majority support that would crash bitcoins value (shortterm, may recover) and pretty sure we would have an emergency hardfork to change POW (code for that already exists). So the miners would be left with warehouses full of useless hardware.
@_date: 2016-04-13 15:43:53
But what is consensus exactly, everyone 100% agreeing for a change will not be possible. Changing protocol rules seem very very hard as we see right now (which is good otherwise bitcoin would be horribly broken).
But if the [Economic majority]( decides to install a version of bitcoin which causes a hardfork,  then the Economic Minority will have to deal with it.
@_date: 2016-04-13 03:55:28
There is a huge difference, for full effect of segwit capacity increase everything has to upgrade (android wallets, electrum servers/wallets, every bitcoin support library, blockexplorers... and so on).
 (Blocksize) Hardfork only needs to upgrade a few thousand fullnodes rest keeps working without needing changes.

Maybe on a very slow device (raspberry), normal consumer hardware should be able to reindex in a day or less. Took me 5 hours the last time, but that was 6 months or so ago.

BTC has blocks like that too, example:  is full but only contains 199 transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:56:31
txindex should make sync a little bit slower, but is needed for stuff like electrum server. To speed up you can raise dbcache (but after sync make sure you shut down cleanly, there is an annoying bug else at next startup with high dbcache values: 
For me it never took longer than 24 hours, the later stages mostly depend on cpu / disk speed.

That seems about what bitcoin core currently gives for confirmation in the next 2 blocks:

@_date: 2016-04-19 21:43:25
Maybe bip101 wasn't optimal but blocks would only fill up if there is demand (current 1MB took years to fill), so I don't see why it "wouldn't even be functioning right now". Maybe years down the line it would have caused problems, who knows. Don't get me wrong I am not opposed to segwit (I even run a testnet node for it), but I still think we should have just hardfork raised the blocksize itself.

It seems the expiry was 72 hours but has been changed to 2 weeks for some [technical reason]( But even then it is not guaranteed that the transaction goes away, not all nodes might obey this rule and keep rebroadcasting the tx.

It is a different form of RBF what they are doing. The RBF in electrum and on the standard bitcoin fullnodes is opt-in RBF where it marks the transaction, so it will be allowed to replace. Some miners (not sure which, I only read about f2pool doing this?) run patched fullnodes that allow other RBF forms where the first transaction does not need to be marked for this to work. The problem is getting your transaction relayed to them, when the rest of the network is mostly not accepting this.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:24:32
And they have a point, they have low fees. Other altcoin shills are also on it already.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:31:30
Likely true, but afaik with bitpay merchants can choose to retain some percent of the purchases in BTC (if they want to).

SSD is faster (especially the initial sync) and makes sense for some applications but it also runs just fine here with good old HDD.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:25:38
It would help somewhat if everyone uses it, but right now its effect seems minimal. My segwit transaction with over 13 USD fee is still not confirming. (I can RBF it higher if it needs to be but it sucks. Don't want to donate to miners, they earn enough right now...) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:18:38
They might have looked at avg fees which indeed spiked close to 20$ a short time ago...: 
And bitpay taking a extra hefty "network fee" surely did not help things.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:11:22
You can only use RBF to bump the fee if the intial transaction was already marked RBF...
If your transaction has a change output you can use "child pays for parent" to increase the fee, but it will be expensive (fee needs to cover 2 transactions). And for this you need to upgrade Electrum to a newer version, I think this exists only in 2.8.2+, if it is available for your transaction there should be an option after you right click the transaction in the history tab.
@_date: 2015-12-08 02:04:19

@_date: 2017-12-17 23:02:04
Hmm, I once had an unconfirmed transaction that disappeared after around 2 weeks from my electrum wallet, so it was possible to respend it. But it is not guaranteed to work like this, because apparently there are nodes on the network which just happily keep rebroadcasting old transactions. So it might work or not after 2 weeks.
Also I've read there are some miners who accept double spends with higher fee under certain conditions, but you somehow would need to relay the transaction to them. Afaik f2pool does this, but to use this here:  you need a referral code.
@_date: 2015-12-22 23:50:19

If you want to do this often it would maybe be a good idea to just register with an exchange, bitstamp or kraken etc.

You can check here if your node is reachable from the outside, if not you have to open port 8333 in your router:  - at the bottom where it says "check node"
Sometimes it can get stuck if your blockchain gets corrupted somehow, if you have incomming connections it is better, but only outgoing should still be enough to get you syncing.
Maybe shut it down and start again and see if it works. If nothing helps you can try to run it with the -reindex argument, but reindexing will take many hours to complete (depends mostly on cpu speed) :(

I like his idea even if it lacks technical details or does not confirm to your BIP standards. Would not be so bad to have options like -bipxzy, if they all have high enough activation targets it is unlikely we will end up with many different chains.

I don't think it bans tor nodes by default, it deprioritizes them when there is a dos attack or something, it can also be turned off with a config option (disableipprio=1) but it would have been better if this would be opt-in not opt-out.
Also I think most big block supporters don't want bitcoinxt, they want something to get merged into bitcoin-core. I don't even care anymore if it is bip 100,101 or 102, just something to buy us some time until overlay networks are there and we can avoid fees getting too high in the meantime.

The thing is that investors and bitcoin holders need to be damn sure this system can keep growing in the meantime, until sw and other improvements come along. This is not only a technical problem, but also a psychological one.
Implementing for example bip202 would probably still work fine today without IBLT and weak blocks, even if it is not optimal. The current situation is very dangerous, likely even more dangerous than just doing a planned hardfork...
@_date: 2015-12-22 22:26:06
I feel like this too, also fully agree with what you said in another comment:


Most users seem to want bigger blocks, chinese miners [said they would be fine with 8mb]( other bitcoin companies [said they would be fine with bip101]( 
If coredevs don't want to do that decision, please make it a user configurable option so we can run bitcoind with a commandline argument like -bip202 or -bip101.
Segwit and co seems nice, but it is questionable if they will arrive in time, and even then it seems we need bigger blocks anyway. May as well go for it now.
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:15:08

Exactly, look where deepbit is now... I see this as a temporary problem, other ASIC producers like friedcat and companies like spondoolie are about to push out some serious hashpower. In a few months ghash.io will have a hard time keeping 20 or 30% of the network hashrate.

At least here in europe data caps are uncommon for home connections, but is normal for mobile connections (LTE). If bigger blocks you could also limit maxconnections or maybe even close port 8333, you don't need to serve others if you don't have the bandwidth imho (but node without port open is still valueable to the network and relays transactions/blocks between the outgoing connected peers, also individual copy of the blockchain is always a good thing).
The node on my desktop has 100 Mbit down/ 40 up with not caps, I don't even notice it running, bandwidth and cpu usage seems minimal. Also running a node on my 5 EUR/Month dedicated server (cheapest I could find lol, kimsufi ks1, serves me well for years now), but it only uses small percentage of my bandwidth/cpu as well, so I started to seed (opensource) torrents again :)  
It is all very relative to your POV, I can kinda understand if your connection has a cap etc, but then is the question if bitcoin needs to be designed around connections with data caps. I think many could serve the chain just fine with 8MB blocks :/ Even the chinese miners behind great firewall once had this agreement that they would be ok with 8MB (back in 2015).
@_date: 2016-01-22 22:47:32
It is also a psychological problem, because bitcoin is perceived as capped, it can only grow a certain amount until blocks are constantly full. This is at best holding back investments or worse makes people divest.
I've already seen OG bitcoiners, who don't recommend bitcoin so much anymore at the moment because of this! Example (from bitcointalk):

Hmm, I shutdown my desktop when I sleep, I guess because of that my number of connections is lower (mostly 20-30), but port is open, and at least afaik there is no throttling from ISP.
But I know from my other node which runs 24/7, that it can hit like 1TB/Month, with between 80-100 connections. Not really small amount, but also not huge for a 100 Mbit/s connection.
I guess you are from the U.S. maybe, it seems data caps are pretty common there, as said here in europe it is more common for mobile connections. Here is an overview for Germany, for DSL/Cable: [without data cap]( [with data cap]( you can see luckily there are many more without, but now that I looked it up there are still more with cap then I thought :/

Was it working with previous versions? You could try downgrading to an older release, like 2.6.1, to see if there is something broken in the latest update: 
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:59:54
But bitcoin core is not a great wallet if you don't run it 24/7 (example: you did not use it for a few days then you want to pay a bitpay invoice that is valid for 15 minutes, good luck). Also no support for hardware wallets / mnemonics. I think this is the main reason many don't run a fullnode, not because they have no resources for it.
@_date: 2016-01-28 01:17:10
Sure there is a size where huge part of the nodes would not be able to keep up. But I am convinced that the system itself would work fine without a hard MAX_BLOCK_SIZE. Miners have great interest that the block propagates fast which means they will keep the size as small as possible, else they get orphans. 
I think we have to get together some experts in game theory, economics and computer scientists to figure this one out.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:05:42
I am worried too, but at the same time maybe this is how bitcoin will govern itself, economic forces at work. To me it seems it are mostly the miners who want bigger blocks (remember they wanted bip100), the block reward is about to be reduced and will cut the profits in half (if price stays the same). So they will need to get as many fee paying tx as possible in the blockchain. Of course bitpay and coinbase also want to make sure that there can be user growth without waiting for more complex things like lightning and so on.


Maybe that is the problem, bitcoin-core should not have control. It is only the reference implementation that everyone voluntarily runs. It was also always said to arguments like "bitcoin will be the myspace of cryptocurrency", that it is opensource, if altcoin xyz implements a killer feature, we can just add this if many people agree - so it has to be able to adapt somehow. I think at this point the best would be for the core-devs to wake up, to what the miners, merchants and users want and maybe just merge the bitcoin-classic patch when it is ready.
I see that from a pure technical pov the blocksize needs to be small, so blocks propagate fast and people can run this on a raspberry, but from an economic pov it needs to be as big as possible. 
Maybe this all totally wrong, I read walls of text here everyday and try to reevaluate but I am still leaning towards raising it up, so we can be sure there is enough space until all the other improvements are ready.

I agree mostly, but 1MB was an aribitrary chosen limit. There should probably be some limit, but it should be based on a free market. There are always costs, so tx will never be super cheap or free (miners/pools also have harddrive, bandwidth costs etc).
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:51:00

Then miners very likely will keep mining 1MB blocks. Afaik all the BU miners use EB1/AD6 so they only create/accept 1MB blocks for now (well except the bitcoin.com accident lol...)

@_date: 2016-03-02 21:32:52
You should still receive it at coinbase when confirmed, usually it shows you a fresh address but the old ones still work.
The problem seems to be that blockchain.info uses a static fee of 0.0001 which is not good. Most wallets today use dynamic fees, they check the network situation first. For example right now to get included in the next 6 blocks, you need to pay:
    $ bitcoin-cli estimatefee 6
    0.00032426
Which is more then 3 times your fee...
should really fix this, see also this github issue: 
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:14:32
Hmm in 2012 he wrote this: (way down at the end of this article:  would love to know why he changed his mind to stay with 1MB blocks:




@_date: 2016-01-19 01:56:09
There is discussion since a long time to raise the [blocksize limit]( ( Bitcoin has a hardcoded blocksize limit of 1MB every 10 minutes, which means there can only be a certain amount of transactions )
To change the 1MB blocksize limit itself you need to do a [hardfork]( which will split the blockchain in two parts (old 1MB chain and the chain with bigger blocks). The old software will not be compatible with the bigger blocks and would ignore them as invalid. That is why the bitcoin-core devs want to avoid this as much as possible, also it has various sideeffects like increased bandwidth usage.
Multiple proposals were discussed to do this but in the end the [bitcoin-core developers decided]( to go with something called [segregated witness]( first - mostly because it can be done as a [softfork]( and it fixes something called [transaction malleability]( - with this the blockdata gets split into transaction and signature, and if I understand it correctly one part will go into the 1MB block and another into an external data structure. This will first allow for around 1.6MB usable space and later when more multisignature transactions happen will be equivalent to 2MB or a little bit more.
It seems bitcoin-core devs want to raise the blocksize limit itself too, but they first want other improvements which will make this easier and more safe for slow internet connections, but there is no clear date or plan when this will happen - which is why now big parts of the bitcoin community are not happy with this - right now bitcoin can only grow a certain amount until there is no more space, this is a horrible [psychological effect]( because bitcoin holders, companies and miners need to be sure there is enough room for growth.
Now another software called "bitcoin classic" is developed which would raise the blocksize limit to 2MB in a hardfork, and many companies and miners are lining up and said they would support this new software. It would start creating bigger blocks after 750 out of 1000 blocks have been mined with this new software (but there are still discussions about this value, some want it to go up to 950 out of 1000 blocks), until that happens it will be compatible with the current 1MB blockchain.
There is still a chance that a solution will be found, but in case a hardfork really happens there will be a lot of uncertainty around this, so the exchange price could take a hit. 
 
In optimal case most fullnodes upgrade the software and the 1MB chain is quickly abandoned, because there is no mining, no exchange to sell, no liquidity. Worst case is some people refuse to upgrade and we end up in chaos with 2 blockchains. But I am somewhat positive that would not last long, because people will be attracted to the side with the [most economic support](

I would agree if this would be something like changing the 10 min blocktime, or smoothing out the blockreward over time. But the hardfork to increase blocksize is already in the roadmap, OP is just asking to put a concrete timeframe on it:
From  :
Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.
Also the inventor himself said we can just raise it later if needed, so it should be a no-brainer, the whole situation is pretty bizzare.

Hmm not sure about exchanges with altcoins.
Yes minority chain, and yes I hope it goes down in a voluntary way without forcing anyone.
I just hope the smart guys find a solution with that everyone can live, current situation is super annoying, every topic turns into blocksize discussion.
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:35:18
Even if the blocklimit would get completely removed, there is still a protocol message limit of 32 MB max. So it would never even come close to VISA transaction numbers, BUT does that mean it should be the total opposite of it?
If userbase keeps growing, then even with segwit and lightning deployed we will need bigger blocksize anyway. I am also a longterm holder but I am very worried about the current state of things lately.
Another thing is the psychological effect it has, the uncertainity when and how exactly we will scale it up holds back investments. We are still in a critical adoption phase imho, so we should do anything possible to keep fees low and users happy. There are thousands other coins just waiting to eat our lunch.
Ofc increases have to be reasonable so that still many many people will be able to run a node. But it has to increase and it has to sooner than later imho :/
@_date: 2016-03-07 04:47:36
You can:
- Wait until it finished syncing, depends on your internet and cpu speed, best case is around 4 hours, worst case may be days.
- If the transaction is already confirmed (check on  for example) download [Electrum]( (a lightweight wallet) create a new wallet (WRITE DOWN THE SEED), then sweep the privatekey* (Inside Electrum: Wallet-&gt; Private Keys -&gt; Sweep) - that creates a new transaction from the bitcoin-core address to an electrum address.
Or, in case you need it even faster.
- Start [Electrum]( Screen pops up that asks to restore/create a new wallet, select restore wallet or import keys -&gt; click next -&gt; enter privatekey* -&gt; click next, choose a password or leave empty, click next, Now you would have an electrum wallet with only this address and you can instantly spend it or whatever. 
But method 3 is not recommended, option 2 is "safer", but the most safest thing is to do nothing if you got the time just wait for the sync to finish.
In case you go with option 3 - it is better to have a real electrum wallet, where you write down the seed words for backup and you automatically have multiple addresses, so after done spending the funds please create a real electrum wallet.
*You can get the privatekey in bitcoin-core, by going to Help-&gt;Debug, then Console, there you enter `dumpprivkey YOURBITCOINADDRESSHERE`, it should output a string of characters which you need to keep secret, that is the privatekey, copy paste it into electrum.
*This assumes you only have used one address in bitcoin-core and there is no password set, else it is a little bit more complicated.*

I only know that the coinbase ceo said they will [follow the longest valid chain (which has economic majority)](

@_date: 2016-01-30 20:46:28


I am not so sure about this, the roadmap contains multiple mentions of increasing the blocksize later (flexcap, 2/4/8 rescaled to segwit). It does not explicitly mention a hardfork but that is the only way this can be archived afaik(?) If so there was agreement on this already. Was ACKed by many people including theymos :)
**They just need to put a timeframe on it, and I think it would _greatly_ defuse the current situation :(**


incentive-aligned dynamic block size controls based on allowing miners
to produce larger blocks at some cost. These proposals help preserve
the alignment of incentives between miners and general node operators,
and prevent defection between the miners from undermining the fee
market behavior that will eventually fund security. I think that right
now capacity is high enough and the needed capacity is low enough that
we don't immediately need these proposals, but they will be critically
important long term. I'm planning to help out and drive towards a more
concrete direction out of these proposals in the following months.

I perceive the current situation as very risky. Even if nothing happens forkwise it at least damages bitcoin's reputation with all the drama.
So just adding a timeframe would be less risky imho. I just don't understand it lol.
@_date: 2017-03-26 11:14:24
Sure I think they could check for some more things, but right now per default they don't afaik (electrum seems to have a setting now where you can set a manual checkpoint). Just found it unfair to bash on breadwallet here :)

- I don't know about BIPs but [jtoomin said]( he will open pull requests to bitcoin-core for major changes. Many people think we need both, bigger blocks and segregated witness. The hardfork course in core's roadmap is very vague, if they would add a clear path for increasing MAX_BLOCK_SIZE it would make many people happy and we would not have this drama all the time. Especially as it now seems this [could also be done as a softfork](
- If your 2MB block DDoS attack problem is because exhausting sigops, then it seems to me this can be easily defended against, see [gavins commit](
- Pretty sure most people can still run nodes at home, even with 2 or 4 MB blocksize, I think there is a range where this is still possible until too many nodes would drop out, it will not be suddenly centralized with 2MB blocks. (Also MAX_BLOCK_SIZE != actual blocksize, maybe miners will keep them much smaller?)
- Can't answer this.
- Pretty sure they would be open to add it, looks like most people like segregated witness and confidential transactions here: 
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:10:42
Gavin did some testing with large blocks, but it seems he only tested on his macbook and a chunkhost vps: 
jtoomin also did some tests for his presentation at scaling hongkong: 
It showed that not only is bandwidth important but also slow cpu can cause problems. (but maybe results will be better in reality now, because 0.12 has libsecp256k1, he did his tests with bitcoinxt testnet)
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:45:21
Well, data also showed that it is not only depended on bandwidth but also depends greatly on cpu speed (my server was the mega shitty overloaded intel atom server from france in his data). Someone should redo these tests with 0.12 which has faster validation, maybe the results would be different. Spamming was not so much a problem in the past (until this "stresstest").

@_date: 2017-03-25 09:44:56
Well, there would be an easy solution if it is only about code quality: Just have option for bigger base blocksize in bitcoin-core.
But as this is not going to happen, people are forced to run other software if they don't agree with the current direction. Too bad.
@_date: 2016-01-28 04:11:24
Allright I am not a programmer, so it is maybe pointless to argue with a dev here, but if I understand it correctly: If MAX_BLOCK_SIZE would not exist, like before satoshi put it in to stop some kind of huge block dos, there is still a maximal protocol message size, which seems to limit blocks to 32 MB (  )
That is still far from the point, where only one operator can run a fullnode, so it still would be decentralized imho.
@_date: 2016-01-31 03:05:18
Yes the roadmap is very good, but I wish they would put a timeframe on increasing the blocksize. Would greatly help to ease the current situation imho... 
Another problem I see is hardfork is hard (duh) so if userbase keeps growing  in the future, this may get really problematic, even now leads to big drama :).
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:29:52
Then you have been lucky that there wasn't much traffic. Few days ago i had to pay over 40 cent for a 226 bytes tx. Or the fee estimation of wallets is seriously broken. Seems the mempool is also not so crowed at the moment: 
@_date: 2017-03-23 02:11:07


It was the exact opposite imho, the statement caused much of the price drop. It introduced more uncertainty, because it made it sound like a contenious fork is imminent, which is not true in my opinion.
Miners get paid in BTC why would the force a fork, makes no financial sense, if fork happens it is still many months away. Everyone needs to chill :)
@_date: 2016-01-29 23:21:20

Cool thanks for the link, interesting read.
@_date: 2016-03-07 20:44:09
TBH I don't see it next month. Segwit is still on a seperate testnet (segnet3) and they want to do a segnet4 soon. One would expect it to come to the "real" bitcoin testnet first before it gets deployed to mainnet.
Even core's own GUI [does currently not display transaction amounts correctly]( I guess it needs to look up something in the witness data for this.
@_date: 2016-03-08 23:20:47
I kind of agree, but what worries me is how mining will be paid for later. Something will have to make up for the shrinking block reward, to me it always made sense to have huge amount of tx with smallish fee to make up for it (like the current fee, not higher, if it is too high people go elsewhere). Maybe if most transactions happen on lightning with high fee settlement tx only on chain will work too, but who knows.
Still think conservative raises which take into account global average internetspeed and things like this should be fine. There must be a sweet spot between everyone can run it on raspberry and datacenter supernodes. I am not technical enough for this, but maybe it is possible that nodes do some bw measurements and report that to the miners to calculate optimal blocksize or something.
@_date: 2016-01-24 17:16:48
They aren't. Atleast coinbase, bitstamp and btcc wants bigger blocks too from what I read.

Maybe 8MB would be suboptimal right now, but I still think it would work somehow. Also maxsize != actual blocksize, 8MB would hopefully take years to fill up.
Imho this should have been fixed years ago, with some dynamic mechanism which scales it up and down as needed. Like this: 
@_date: 2017-03-27 18:50:19
Nothing wrong with it, just wanted to point out that getting a 5 cent fee tx mined is pretty uncommon nowadays. Right now I have a 224 byte tx, sent almost 3 hours ago, with 0.000301 fee (was default fee slider setting in electrum "within 5 blocks") and it has not a single confirmation yet, and there have been 7 blocks now. just annoying -_- 
Edit: CPFP for the win, bumped the fee after 5 hours and then it quickly confirmed.

Can you explain what you mean with "garbage"? Could segwit maybe combined with a [2MB softfork]( This would hopefully take time to fillup, in the meantime a real solution could be implemented with a possible hardfork later but well planned (bitpay adaptive etc).
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:16:30
But you can create small (or empty) blocks even today, so that theory does not make much sense to me.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:02:28
Yeah I don't know, then do it as softfork, maybe [this here]( combined with segwit somehow. No one cares how, but it seems many people want more blockspace asap.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:03:34
No it is fine for now imho. It is only that if there are suddenly different chains (like in a fork) breadwallet will follow the one with the most hashrate, which is normally a good thing. If that happens and for whatever reason you don't want to follow the most hashrate , then you need to use your backup seed with another wallet that supports this (I think the wallet "multibit" can connect to a local running bitcoin-core fullnode and should be compatible with the breadwallet seed). 
@_date: 2016-01-04 01:49:48
The coins are already sitting there waiting, you can look at them with a blockexplorer like  if you want. But if you haven't done so please make a backup of your wallet file (File-&gt;Backup wallet) to a safe place (usbstick etc).
Now to use the coins with bitcoin-core it needs to download and process the whole blockchain, currently my bitcoin folder is 63GB big. If you have enough diskspace and your internet and computer is fast it should finish this in under 24 hours usually. So the best thing would be just to wait it out.
But if it is really urgent you could also export the private key of the address in question and use that in any other client (there are light clients which do not download the whole blockchain, for example  and on android wallets like mycelium, iphone: breadwallet)  &lt;- please note the warning on that page, the safest thing is to wait for bitcoin-core to sync
@_date: 2016-06-24 17:42:44
The trezor is like a small mini computer, it never shares the privatekeys with the device it is connected to. Instead it communicates with a special message protocol, if you pay with your trezor it receives an unsigned transaction from the wallet software you use (mytrezor,electrum, mycelium etc), then displays stuff for you to confirm. If you click ok it signs the transaction with the privatekey on the trezor itself and then communicates the signed transaction back to the wallet software. So it is very different from a normal usb stick :)

bitcoin-core changed those type of transactions to non-standard around that time, because people were abusing it to modify transaction ids (malleability). So now transactions need to have the low-S value, while earlier it didn't matter if it was high or low, else they don't get relayed by nodes.

Apparently adjustable fees have been introduced with multibit classic 0.5.19. So I would suggest you upgrade to that (I guess you have an even older version), then use a higher fee value.

Sure but then you get most likely no confirmations. In the past you could send old coins without fee, but this is [disabled per default since bitcoin-core 0.12](  and it was only reserved for a small amount of the total blocksize. So basicly you always would need to pay a fee.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:09:42
Increasing blocksize is not temporary. If you argue like that then segwit is also only a one trick pony (can only be done once). Ofc you can't keep increasing it to infinity, but resonable size in regards to todays technology should be fine (There was this study which suggests 4MB would be fine today). We could also use the increased space more efficient later (schnorr signatures etc).

Do you have a link or some proof that he tried to "bribe" chinese miners to run Classic. I follow everything pretty closely here on both subreddits but have never heard of this.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:28:40
The study was also done some time in the past, with faster validation since 0.12 and things like compactblocks or xthin blocks things may look very different now. To me it still suggests that 1MB is a suboptimal value right now.
Also one of the authors is Christian Decker, he said in this [arcticle](  That, of course you quickly get to natural limits by increasing the blocksize (latency and so on), but he also said that he calculated the breakdown point in 2012 to be around 13,5 MB and that today with things like the relaynetwork it is probaly higher. He also said that he thinks, 2 or 4 maybe even 8 MB could be possible today.
Edit: I think we need a combination of things like segwit, ligtning and also bigger blocksize. Else I don't see the whole thing working longterm.

Hmm I don't use multibit wallet myself. But there 2 different multibit, classic and HD. But if you now have 2 multibit "classic", then you should be able to open your old wallet with File-&gt;Open wallet.
According to this  it makes automatic backups which should be in the old multibit folder. Hope that helps you. It seems multibit also has a support you can contact (support AT keepkey.com).

Check out electrum: 
Bitcoin-Core can also do offline signing but it is more complicated: 
If you really want to create the whole transaction by hand etc you need to be very careful, thats how people ended up with paying 100+ BTC transaction fees in the past. 


The last address looks like their change address, and they probably intended to send 301.44158 back to themselves instead of 101.44158. Whoops
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:05:29
imho: We need to keep fees as low as possible for as long as possible. 1. To be competitive (remember there are like ~1000 other coins, paypal and so on, else they will cut more and more into our marketcap) and 2. In case value ever stabilizes that we can onboard poor people from india africa and so on (else one tx fee will be more than they make in a day)
The easiest way to accomplish this is a combination of segwit, bigger blocks AND things like the lightning network. (of course it has to be carefully done to not endanger decentralization too much, but it has to scale up as much as safely possible!)
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:21:48
I still think fees actually have to go down over time, at least denominated in BTC/per tx, otherwise high prices will not be sustainable (e.g. bitcoin becomes world currency, 1 satoshi = 1USD, makes no sense to have a 50000 satoshi Fee).
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:23:44
Who knows, price seems to have gone up a lot since the NY Agreement, so seems the market likes the prospect of scaling in multiple ways (segwit + legacy blocksize increase, best of both worlds), so I think the price might go down some if miners pull out of 2x.
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:11:21
BTC, but you pay a fee everytime you spent, they have a "Debit Card Exchange Rate" that is a few percent (around ~3 for my last payments) lower than the USD price it shows at the top banner. It's still cool as long as BTC goes up in value lol, but I think this fact is a bit hidden.

Yesterday was bad, wanted to rent a vps, cost 3.99 USD, only option was monthly billing. +1,50 USD bitpay network fee(wtf?) + 1.69 USD "low" mycelium fee (~170 sat/byte), didn't confirm after over 10 hours, did CPFP it for another 3 USD or so.
While at the same time I saw some 60 sat/byte tx confirm, total bullshit, don't understand why miners are including 60 sat/byte tx while mine sits there unconfirmed for half a day (and it was small tx 1 input, 2 outputs), do they prefer some transaction for a reason other than fees? Found that strange.

Bitcoin can only process a limited amount of transactions every 10 minutes. So miners include the transactions that pay most fee which results in people bidding for the limited transactional space. You can see fee estimates here:

Unfortunate that not more normal people run 2x nodes, but I think having many nodes kinda makes sense. It needs to possibly serve millions of SPV wallets, each node by default has 125 max connections.

I think the problem is the output of 0.00000141 BTC, bitcoin has something called "dust limit" which seems to be 546 Satoshi right now. So if I understand it correctly there is a high chance that this transaction will never confirm.
Safest thing is to wait, afaik blockchain.info drops unconfirmed transactions after a day or two, it should become available then.
If you don't want to wait you could try to import the privatekey of the address 1MSHgWDsDWNT9sN2xe3yiZ9aNzFffGyjBe into another wallet to make your transaction (mycelium, electrum etc etc)
There is a good chance that would work, because I don't even see the transaction on 2 nodes here, so you can doublespend it easily :)
*(But be sure you understand what you are doing, this has some risks: 
@_date: 2016-02-19 03:45:46
If it is not urgent the safest is to just wait it out (if your network/computer is not super slow that should not take longer than a day or so), your bitcoin is fine, the wallet just doesn't know about it yet until it has processed that point in the blockchain. Also make a backup of your wallet (File-&gt;Backup), just in case :)
As someone else mentioned you could also export the privatekey but that is not really recommended thing to do.
@_date: 2016-02-19 00:22:30
Pretty good overall, but some additional info:
Peter said there was no longterm plan for classic. It seems the unofficial plan is to have another hardfork later with most likely a dynamic scaling (like what bitpay's stephen pair suggested): 
Also he said there was no testing done with bip109, this is true, but the code is mostly the same like bip101 (minus the growing blocksize), which was running on testnet for some time, and there was no real problem afaik.
If the only real problem is the 75% activation, then core should release its own patch with 95-99% activation, which can be enabled with a commandline switch, -vote2mb  for example. :)

If it's weeks already the transactions will most likely never confirm.
If your wallet is bitcoin core/bitcoin-qt you can remove unconfirmed transactions from your wallet with the commandline option: `-zapwallettxes` (available since version 0.9.0 - this option will remove transactions from the wallet, then rescans the blockchain to rebuild transaction history)
If your wallet is multibit, it also has an option to reset the blockchain, which also should remove unconfirmed transactions: 
Always make a backup of your wallet first, just in case.

It is noteworthy that the inventor of bitcoin, satoshi, said we can just raise the blocksize limit later no problem: 
^ This is why many people are upset right now, imho
- bitcoin-core wants to deploy something called segregated-witness first, which will not touch the blocksize limit itself but results in around 1.7 MB of usable block space. And at a later stage they want to raise the blocksize limit itself when they are 1000% sure it will not cause other problems (but so far no date for this was specified).
- bitcoin-classic thinks this is too overconservative and they want to change this hardcoded limit  asap to 2 MB (in that case everyone would have to upgrade his software, else there is a risk that the blockchain breaks up into 2 parts). They think seg-wit is untested and will maybe not be enough because blocks are already pretty full. They think transaction fees could get to high and backlogs would lead to bad user experience
Edit: Bigger blocks use more bandwidth, but saying the big blockers want a datacenter only bitcoin is very oversimplified FUD imho. Internet access seems to get faster all the time, so reasonable increases should be ok. But even today most reachable fullnodes seem to be in datacenters or on cable connections.
Edit2: Also I think the bitcoin-core devs are very scared to change the blocksize limit itself, because it would be a hardfork, this has never been done except in an emergency situation, so it seems they want to avoid this as much as possible. The bitcoin-classic guys think it is not such a big deal and want to risk it.

Hmm the problem in the first place is that blockchain.info should not allow transactions with such small outputs, it only leads to confusion and bad user experience.
You can see at other blockexplorers, that your address still contains the BTC:
The very small transaction gets not accepted by most nodes in the network, but blockchain.info thinks it is totally legit so it does not let you send -_-
You can just wait (I read that it will take like 2-3 days, after that blockchain.info removes the unconfirmed tx) or use another wallet like I said above (electrum,mycelium) and import the privatekey :(
**Edit**: Ok here is what you can do if it can't wait until it gets removed by itself.
Follow the steps in [this link, but replace step 10,11,12 with below:](
**10** -  Download  and create a new wallet (**IMPORTANT: !!! WRITE DOWN THE SEED WORDS !!!**)
**11** - In Electrum go to Wallet-&gt;Private Keys-&gt;Sweep -&gt; enter your privatekey from address 1MSH....
**12** - Electrum now creates a transaction from your old address to an adress in the electrum wallet, wait for a confirmation, your funds should be available in Electrum now.
If that worked you don't need blockchain.info anymore lol :)
@_date: 2016-02-19 06:31:28
It is not recommended because handling the private keys is the job of the wallet program. If you "sweeped" it into another wallet it is fine (creates a new transaction to an address controlled by the wallet).
But some wallets also allow "import" privatekeys, then you can be in a weird state where an address is valid in multiple wallets, that is usually not a good idea :) 
For example you import your privatekey from computer A in your secure wallet on another computer B. Now computer A gets compromised by a hacker, he now also has access to the bitcoin address you imported on your secure computer B.
It can also lead to unexpected problems with backups, if you know about these risks it is fine, but most people don't.

@_date: 2016-02-11 18:39:17
Then what is the hold up, get a date/timeframe for a hardfork into the roadmap. I already tried here:  , even Luke-Jr tried to get something in there (f2ddba8):  but so far - *crickets* :)
If you guys are awesome you get a date in there for a flexcap.
Also I think all that fear about "contentious" hardfork is so overblown, the miners will only
activate a fork if majority of fullnodes support bigger blocks, else nothing will happen, they don't want to kill the golden goose. Maybe core should embrace classic and see what "sticks" first, if majority of nodes support 2MB before segwit is rolled out, maybe it is not so stupid to do this first then, if not not.
@_date: 2016-02-21 10:35:03
There are services that can do that too, for example I know about  (can do paypal payments, EUR sepa transfers, also has a debit card) and  (can do send/receive!

Transaction fees will rise, in extreme cases maybe pricing out some people. If blocks are constantly full it leads to backlogs, bad user experience if it takes many hours to get into a block. Also real risk that value will overflow to somewhere else, altcoins for example.

I agree but it needs more improvements in regard to wallet use. Regular backups suck (keypool) and there is no support for hardware wallets. Also it needs some kind of SPV mode so it works before it is completly synced.

The iso file on the ledger site is a live linux system, after you boot from it, it is separated from your normal operating system. Once the wallet has been intialized by this you should be fine.

Fee is on the lower end with current network condition (last blocks I see on blockchain info were all like 999kb...) it will probably go through but will take 4 hours or maybe longer - Otherwise the transaction looks fine to me.
Edit: I don't see the transaction ID on my node, also not on blockexplorer.com hmm, but if it shows up on blockchain info it can't be so wrong. Maybe try doublespend with higher fee.

Maybe the xapo card:  good thing about this one is that the card balance is in BTC and if you buy something it gets converted to USD/EUR as needed.

Check if your transaction id is still visible on various blockexplorers:
If not you can sweep the privatekeys in electrum without problem. Otherwise you can still try, but it can fail if the electrum server connected to has the transaction floating around in its mempool.


If you doublespend you use the same coins, but in a new transaction:

They have a iso file which can be put on usb stick or burned on cd, you can boot your computer with this and use it to initialize the wallet:

Make sure the electrum server you connected to is up to date (the dot in the right bottom corner needs to be green, if it is red or orange click it and try a different server). You can also look up your transaction on a blockexplorer, right click the transaction and choose "view on blockexplorer".
If the fee was too low there is not much you can do because it is set by the sender, in this case localbitcoins.

This thing needs a flexcap asap, from my POV it can increase/decrease very conservative so decentralization will not get lost on the way. But I don't think a static limit will work longterm.
@_date: 2016-09-24 21:01:24
Sorry to be this guy, I am sick of this topic too, but blocksize limit is not the same as the actual blocksize, it took years to (almost) fill the current limit, don't see why this would be different with a bigger limit.  If we would have reasonable increases, like for example 8MB right now maybe, or a flexible limit, this does not mean you need a google datacenter to run a node. We would lose some raspberry pi or cheap vps nodes, but maybe this is a tradeoff that has to be done. Most people would not even run a node with 100kb blocks, because they are as lazy as it gets, so they use mycelium and so on, that's just how it is.
In Germany, [Telekom and Nokia has already tested 1 Terrabit/s over existing fiber connections]( They are also doing things like "super vectoring" which will allow speeds up to 250 Mbit/s for existing vdsl customers, planed for roll out in 2018. So blocks would have to get realllly huge to end up on "datacenter only" nodes. I think this fear is mostly unfounded, as it looks like global available bandwidth still is growing nicely overall.
Imho: too small is bad, too big is bad, we need to find the value in between that makes the most sense in relation to transaction fees and bandwidth :(

@_date: 2017-09-30 01:01:51
okay, but you actually don't need to serve other nodes if you don't have the bandwidth to do that. Keeping up with the chain to validate yourself does not need much bandwidth (blockstream has rented satellite transponders that do max 64 kbit/s). 
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:22:07
The NY Agreement did not happen because of UASF, it was because they need a bitcoin that scales because they pay gazillion in tx fees and waste resources on costumer support.
At first the result was not compatible with UASF at all, they wanted to deploy segwit2x independent from current core nodes, but this after many pages of discussions on github got changed to use bip91 instead which was compatible with the already deployed segwit bitcoin-core nodes. 
But this still wasn't compatible with UASF nodes because it had a different time frame for the activation, only later jameshilliard figured out a way to make it activate faster so it can happen earlier. Only at this point the miners accepted this because it was the least disruptive way forward and it became compatible with UASF. So UASF may have speed this process up but wasn't the cause.

No just wait, it will likely get some opt-in replay protection that can be used to split coins. Electrum will work with both chains, it depends which server you are connected to and what fullnode they are running.

Segwit is a softfork, in the past such things have been activated by miners via something called BIP9, where 95% of the miners need to agree to a change. 
Segwit alone only ever reached around 30% for months and stagnated there. Companies like coinbase and bitpay and miners got together and agreed to activate segwit, but only if the blocksize gets increased in a hardfork later (because they think segwit alone is not enough to support new users and keep transaction reliable / fees reasonable). This the "New York Agreement", that created segwit2x, it quickly got enough support to activate segwit and includes a hardfork 2x increase 3 months after segwit has been activated (in november).
The main bitcoin-core developers and people in this subreddit are salty now and not happy with that, because a hardfork is a radical change in the system and makes the blockchain incompatible with old versions, also bigger blocks result in more diskspace/bandwidth usage which they don't like. That is why some  now call it an attack.
Depends on PoV I guess, but imho bitcoin is a voluntary system where every participant can run the software he wants, that includes miners and the companies that agreed to run the segwit2x software.
Maybe also worth noting is that this agreement was only neccessary, because there was another failed agreement called the "Hong Kong Agreement" last year, where some prominent bitcoin-core developers agreed with the miners to support a 2MB hardfork increase, if there is enough community support, together with segwit. But that kinda fizzled out and the 2MB part was discarded. If that meeting did not happen miners would have likely installed a 2MB blocksize increase via BIP109 (bitcoin classic) back then already (it was just getting real traction as the HK Agreement was made, which included the sentence "We will only run Bitcoin Core-compatible consensus systems, eventually containing both SegWit and the hard-fork, in production, for the foreseeable future.", so most miners stopped using bitcoin classic at this point).
Its complicated and annoying lol.

Try a node restart, if that doesn't help "addnode" a few bitcoin cash nodes, maybe this will get it going again:
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:14:01
Do you really believe this? Segwit has a theoretical maximum of close to 4MB, but even if everyone uses segwit with todays transaction patterns it will be around 2 MB blocks (guesses are between 1.7 and 2.2 MB). 2x doubles this, which will put the realworld max around 4 MB. This is very much technical possible while still most people can run a node at home.

It seems you have to dump the wallet backup to get to the recovery seed, then it can be imported in a BCC wallet.

Edit: This is if you use the schildbach android wallet, might be different with other wallets.
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:50:02
Bitcoin Cash is something completely different, some of us wanted bigger blocks and segwit, not a minority fork that only has one.
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:32:04
You can also run a node with low bandwidth. I still think if someone lives in rural somewhere, he does not has to serve hundred other peers. Just receiving blocks does not take much bandwidth (right now only a few kbyte/s), and you can still verify blockhashes with other nodes.
It just needs some kind of balance between cost of node and cost of transaction. Because if they are priced out from transacting what will be the reason for them to run a node.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:11:00
the segwit2x-dev branch is based on 0.15, and it also has the new per-txout stuff. Not sure what these bugs should be he mentions lol. But the problem seems not to be rebasing it.
@_date: 2017-10-01 22:07:33
Yes but the service bit has nothing to do with the blocks. That is what a node tells another node when it connects.
What I tried to say was the other way around, for example my node has 100 mbit/s flatrate. I think it should be possible for new users, that go likely with the default choice 0.15, to download the blockchain from me. Until mid november they are 100% compatible, just seems like a waste to disconnect me so early.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:10:00
btc, if it really gains majority miners and does not get punished by holders. Old chain can find a new ticker.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:41:21
This is not disguising 2x blocks. It is an _optional_ switch that can disable the NODE_SEGWIT2X service bit. It still defaults to not hiding. Just some of us disagree that our btc1 node needs to be disconnected months in advance (they work perfectly fine until mid november). With this option enabled new bootstrapping 0.15.x nodes can do initial blockchain download from btc1 nodes. In any case they will become incompatible after the fork because the first block after fork needs to be bigger than what core nodes accept.
The assumption for no replay protection until now was that +90% of the miners signal support for 2x. If that really happens with so much hashrate then it becomes very unsafe (and slow) to transact on the legacy chain. But it seems they will add optional replay protection, so if someone wants to split coins he can easily do it:














from here: 
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:43:48
Not only that, you also pay a second "network fee" to bitpay, which is also pretty high (at least with low value orders they do this now.).  So if your pizza is 20 EUR, you pay bitcoin fee, + the extra bitpay "network fee". You see that on the invoice if you click the arrow besides your bill value, then it exapands and becomes visible, they auto add that to your bill... I always liked bitpay but this is complete bullshit to pay double fee.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:18:14
With node restart I just mean to close the software and start it again (the good old turn it off and on again lol).
If you want to try addnode, find a node from the list in the bitnodes link, for example 95.80.44.100:8333 is an bitcoin abc node.
Then in the node software click help -&gt; debugwindow, then select the console tab and enter:
    
    addnode 95.80.44.100:8333 onetry
 That will try to connect to this node, one time. You can repeat this step multiple times with different ip addresses if you want, and in the tab "peers" you can see if you are connected to this peer now.
I am not sure if it works, it shouldn't be needed to do this, but might be worth a try.

It's better to have coins in your own wallet anyway in all cases. But if this results in 2 chains, my guess it they will handle it similar to the bitcoin cash splitoff, they likely allow you to withdraw on both chains.

Not sure about the exact reasons, but seems this idea has been discarded.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:14:54
Most big blockers prefer a combination of reasonable blocksize increases and offchain scaling. The lightning whitepaper also says it eventually needs bigger blocksizes at global scale. So a more realistic longterm goal (in a far future) would be maybe 100 MB or so (if not less). Not giga or terrabyte.

It does not ever need 1 PB blocks. LN can work together with bigger blocks, so we likely need sizes much less than that.

@_date: 2018-07-06 20:04:41
Yeah but with bitpay you pay the fee two times, one time it is added to your purchase amount (and last time I paid a bitpay invoice in my browser window, the extra fee was even hidden under a dropdown button, in the screenshot here it clearly shows at least) and you pay the miner fee from your wallet.

Those apps are kinda shady, but they are around for years now, so I risked it on an old smartphone.

You can fill in the amount so the person who sends only scans the qrcode and he just have to click send, so he does not have to manually type it.

Multiple reasons:
1. Your transaction depends on [two]( [inputs]( that have not confirmed yet

Most wallets should support bip70, if you really want you can of course decode the payment request, someone made a python tool for this:

Funny how this gets downvoted, scammers vote manipulating? Hope most users check the url first :(
@_date: 2017-05-18 01:56:15
And you know why, because none of the alts have the problem that blocks are too small, they have almost no transactions. And I would guess 99% of the coins listed implemented segwit because they wanted to have a reason to get pumped, not because they are interested in the technicals behind it.

Paypal will probably add some nice markup to bitcoin payments to rip us all off:

If you wrote down the seed you can just restore your wallet (always write it down!!).
Did you buy something for [0.01000255 a few days ago]( If so I would say the 2.2BTC is a change transaction. If not I would guess you got hacked and the hacker is a troll and added his address as watchonly to your wallet... :(
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:14:58
It is for testing mostly right now, but actually there are like ~10 nodes on mainnet.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:55:34
I am not sure, it kinda seems like expected behaviour to me. If bip91 locks in it does not accept non-segwit blocks, that is needed to reach the 95% threshold to activate segwit.
Miners need to add some btc1 peers and they are fine imho.
Also would surprise me if we see many non segwit blocks once bip91 has locked in, but I guess we find out soon...

Please, there are surely altcoin guys who spread bullshit, or try to cause more chaos so they can have their shit pumped. But some big blockers have been around for a long time and hold BTC, why would they want to destroy it, please be logical.
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:13:39
Bitcoin only has limited capacity and the last days there are a lot of transactions going on, likely other transactions are paying a higher fee, so miners include them first :/
If electrum shows the address in yellow it means it is a [change address]( this is an address from your own wallet. But this is good news it means you could use "CPFP" (Child pays for parent) to bump up your fee, if you have the newest electrum version (2.8.2 right now), it should be available if you right click your transaction in the history tab, at least this worked for me the last time I had a stuck transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-28 00:14:45
Afaik they agreed to activate segwit because they also agreed in a [meeting]( to further increase blocksize if necessary.


@_date: 2015-11-29 15:55:50
Yes that is correct, all addresses can be derived from the seed.
In reality the seed looks like a long random string like:
It just gets translated into words so it can be easier written down etc. The software has some algorithm which gets that random string again from the seed words if you have to restore your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 22:56:09
Miners seem to hold bitcoin too. Not 100% sure the label is correct but here is f2pool wallet with 10000 BTC 
Bitmain also:  that address there has 23000 BTC and if you google it really seems to be related to bitmain.
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:48:41
Bitfury is listed as supporter of the NY Agreement thing, so maybe the effect of 2x segwit isn't as bad as a plain blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-05-21 02:46:18
It's good that you have no problem. My transactions also always worked fine. But it seems there are people who have problems, and I don't think all of them are "trolls". For example read this thread here: 
If something like this happens it can be highly annoying. Maybe they are just using shitty wallets, I don't know. :(
@_date: 2017-07-09 03:19:22
segwit is kinda strange in that regard it allows a max of 4MB blocks, but this can only happen with blocks that are full with very heavy multisignature transactions. With the type of transactions we currently see on the network the estimates are more like between 1.7 and 2.1 MB and this extra space becomes available over time as people move to use segwit addresses, it is not instant.
@_date: 2016-05-24 12:40:56
Would not help much imho. They would just fill warehouses with gpu miners, see this screenshot about some altcoin mining op:
 
@_date: 2017-07-17 00:35:41
I doubt we see many bip91 blocks tomorrow, the timeline was to do testing first and start signaling on 21th July.
@_date: 2017-05-31 02:48:48


Pretty sure this is the one from cornell, one of the authors himself said the results are outdated, network has grown faster and software more efficient: 
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:51:42
Blocksize increases were always "kick the can" proposals, nothing wrong with this imho to temporary gain more space that can be later used in a more efficient way.
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:50:45
Yeah sorry about that. Maybe I misunderstood it somehow, it appeared like you were thinking segwit alone would keep doubling blocksize. Seems there are other things which will get deployed on top of segwit for more effective usage, you probably meant this.
@_date: 2017-07-08 23:51:52


segwit2x does this in my eyes, its worst case block is 8MB (segwit alone 4MB), but that can only be reached with special crafted blocks, it will be more like around ~4MB maximum. That size can still be handled by many home connections or nodes on TOR network imho.
Here is a blocksize simulator, if you plug in 4MB it does not look so crazy: 
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:03:50
You never know if your comment goes through or not, I posted a [reply]( to a 2 week old post earlier today and it does not show up (you can click my username than it shows up in that list). I guess automod removes posts based on certain keywords/subredditlinks, very untransparent.

Most of the current seednodes are controlled by blockstream, or very close people

If it does not fix itself after closing and reopen multiple times, you can try the "repair wallet" option:

A default Electrum seed is not compatible with a mycelium seed, Electrum has a slightly different seed format. Also it is not the best idea to share a seed on multiple devices imho, you then have multiple points where someone could steal the seed. 
*(But there is a way around this if you really want, when you create a new wallet with Electrum: select "restore a wallet", at the bottom select "hardware wallet", then select "Keepkey" or "Trezor", and select "Restore Electrum wallet from device seed words", enter mycelium seed, leave passphrase empty - that should work)*
Best is still to create a normal electrum wallet, write down the seed - then send the bitcoins in a normal transaction from mycelium to electrum.
@_date: 2016-05-27 16:04:30
Also had a tx yesterday took like 4 hours for first confirmation.
Was send with mycelium "normal" fee. I guess you need to wait it out :(

 here are some user reviews, some of the more mature user account reviews are mixed:


So, i can say this service isn't scam and they sell cheap amazon gift code, but customer service is really bad and they really slow to process customer's order.
I once bought an amazon.de code from  worked fine and almost instantly -  so I can recommend that.
It seems  also has amazon codes.
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:41:51
Hmm thanks for your post. I know about the roadmap, but I did not know that for example Schnorr sigs are apparently very efficient ([here]( it says could bring up to 40% more capaticity for regular tx, even more for multisig), I was thinking it brings a few percent only or something. Maybe we also have some kind of information deficit between the different groups :/
Guess I have to read up some more about MAST etc.


I hope this is true, because it sometimes does not feel like it :)
@_date: 2016-07-23 22:45:16
Lol he did not make this up, the people from the "[hongkong agreement]( promised a HF code to the miners. If this is adopted or not is another question.
Segwit will help, but is also already delayed, it was expected in april/may, and it will probably be another few months from now, because it seems not to be in 0.13.0 (only testnet), seems segwit on mainnet will come with 0.13.1. And you can do the segwit blocksize effect only once afaik. So we need to find a solution for later now.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:35:26
Electrum servers get the data from the running bitcoind:
    $bitcoin-cli estimatefee 2
    0.00383219
The result is displayed in BTC/KB so it still shows ~380 satoshi/byte which is quite high. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 01:02:44
 (it was earlier called coinimal) can do BTC-&gt; Skrill
Or localbitcoins, but you need to research the trading partner, that he has good ratings etc 
Also always google services which you have never used for reviews etc, there are many scammers in the bitcoin world who happily will take your bitcoin for nothing in return :/
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:47:30
afaik electrum by default uses a different seed format which is not compatible with multibit hd and other bip39 wallets, I always thought that sucks lol. If you really want to work around this and use electrum, I think you can use restore hardware wallet trezor/keepkey and then choose "Restore Electrum wallet from device seed words". (because those devices are bip39 wallets, this should work in theory ~~but I have not tested it~~... Edit: This works fine with a seed from "mycelium" android wallet :D) 
But I would really try the "repair wallet" option first which I posted above somewhere, maybe this will fix your problem already.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:24:22
Because the devs of the legacy client always were against hardforks (The NY Agreement includes a 2MB hardfork soon after segwit). Imho some of them only agreed to the Hong Kong agreement in 2016 for politcal reasons to stop bip109 from succeeding.
@_date: 2016-07-23 23:38:08
Yeah, depends on the definition of "released". Someone who says he was at the meeting had the impression release in the context means pull request submitted and code available for review: 
It also says


As segwit is already live on testnet, should this not already have started, I have not seen a github with work in this regard so far.
@_date: 2016-07-04 22:51:35
I have "Dynamic fees" checkbox ticked and fee multiplier set to 110% that works fine for me so far. With the dynamic fee setting it queries the electrum server for correct fee. This should be much better than a static amount.
@_date: 2015-02-07 04:10:53
There is also coincola.com (has multisig escrow) and stuff like openbazar is coming.
@_date: 2016-07-09 11:12:48
It seems the address where your coins went, has sent 35 BTC to the exchange "btc-e.com" ~~a few days ago~~ yesterday. 
That is a point where an investigation could start. Also you need to find out how this could happen, maybe your computer has malware or something.
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:52:46


WAT, segwit is a one time thing. As more wallets support it it gets more useful, but it does not continue to double the blocksize.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:28:16
0.0001 is too low, will probably not confirm. :(
If you are lucky your transaction has a change output back to you, then you can right click your transaction in the history tab and increase the fee with the option "Child pays for parent". But you need at least Electrum Version 2.8.2 for it to work, and it only works if you have a change output other wise the option is not available. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:29:14
No seems about right, there are over 7000 bitcoin nodes that have port 8333 open (and more behind firewalls), but only like ~450 are BIP148 nodes. Hashrate for it also seems tiny (and if nothing goes very wrong the miners will activate segwit soon via bip91, so it is unnecessary anyway).
@_date: 2016-07-20 18:55:34
Not sure if this still works, see other comment. But the homepage says [here]( (this also lists other methods, sepa deposit is free for example): 


Also [here]( it says:

I have both and the cards come from the same issuer in gibraltar... :)
Main difference is with the Xapo you hold your card balance in bitcoin, if you buy something it gets converted on the fly - with bitwala you convert to fiat at the moment you load the card. 
And fees, bitwala has a small card loading fee (0.5%, minimum fee 1EUR) but then spending is free. Xapo has no loading fee, but they take a small fee from every purchase (this fact is a bit hidden: 
Despite the fee on every purchase I like the xapo card more, because holding balance in bitcoin.

Also possible it took coinbase some time to broadcast the transaction. I remember in the past I read about a few cases with bitpay invoices timing out because of this...
@_date: 2016-07-08 07:52:33
I downvoted your submission because there was already a earlier post about it: 
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:36:14
If I Interpret the google translate correctly, the poster says there was a meeting between chinese miners where they concluded to support a hardfork. If this is correct this is more than a random post, but is definitly unconfirmed speculation so far.
As you said the miners can't force it alone, that would be like suicide. It's more like they can propose something (like everyone else can) and the rest of the ecosystem can voluntary adopt it until it reaches economic majority (but where that point is is not really defined :&amp;), or they don't and the current rules stay in place.

It's the software behind an agreement of 80% of the mining hashrate and some major bitcoin companies:
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:16:45
Or merge BIP91, that would also work, right?
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:31:01
Or merge segwit2x, it might take 2 weeks longer but you get segwit w/ miners and without risk of splitting bitcoin up. But whatever 
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:16:30
There is a testnet prerelease in github / bitpay (not sure I am allowed to link this here...). They will likely use the current pullrequest to the github you linked, maybe with some small changes.
Seems they have some internal communication (slack maybe?). We will see on June 16 if they come up with something useful.
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:59:01
I read the blogpost as an emergency plan in case there is indeed a second chain with BIP148 that has just enough hash power that there is a probability of it reorging the mainchain later.
@_date: 2017-06-11 11:16:42
Makes sense, we should at least switch to mBTC for now. But my fear is that high transaction fees will be a bigger problem then.
Imagine we price in bits and someone buys 10000 bits on an exchange, he tries to transfer to his wallet...and 1000 bits are gone for tx fee :/. I think fees denominated in bitcoin have to actually go down for this to work longtime...
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:10:21
Imho segwit alone will not help much, say in best case it cuts fees in half, then they are still too high. Imho it was a big mistake of the core developers not to listen to Gavin 2 years ago (you can argue that bip101 was too much maybe, but still).
@_date: 2013-12-18 13:19:38
Sure why not, sell some if it is too risky for you right now. Your money, you can do whatever the fuck you want :)

Is it even legal for Ripple Labs to issue XRPs? It is a U.S. Company and XRP is traded like a security, could not the S.E.C. show up any moment?
