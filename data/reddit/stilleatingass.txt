I got confirmed! Go check yours!

Same right here man, a transaction for about $120 worked and took about 20 minutes. Just tried again with about 600 and it's been like that for about 4 hours.

Mine went through, check it now!
@_date: 2016-08-16 05:19:53
Mine just updated, you should go check yours out :)
@_date: 2016-08-16 08:10:34
Yeah, that's true. About 4 hours after the initial transaction, it has updated. Not worried anymore!
@_date: 2016-08-16 02:23:38
:) I'm not too worried honestly. If it doesn't clear by tomorrow then I'm definitely going to inquire.

Don't know what that guy posted but I can post proof of the confirmation of the wire transfer sent, and emails between support and I if needed.
I had no desire to badmouth gemini until I was treated this poorly.

Basically I bought bitcoin through gemini and the site is buggy and said that I created an order to sell the coin that doesnt pop up in my dashboard. No worries, I'd email support and they'd fix it.
Everything was smooth up until trying to pull the coins to a different wallet.
Nope. I even had a support guy named shane tell me that it was fixed and it wasnt.

The problem was that I deposited money and then bought the coin, which I have emails for that confirms this and dashboard confirms it. My account got bugged with an order to sell all my bitcoin when I was trying to move the coins to the other wallet. I know for a fact I hit withdraw and not sell, which irritates me.
