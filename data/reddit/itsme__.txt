Can we stream this somewhere? I'm not a college football fan but I'd watch this for sure.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:10:23
Indeed. They literally write some of the worst legislation for some of the worst politicians (dem and repub).
@_date: 2014-08-29 15:56:16
Great point.

Looks photoshoped. Anyone look up the address?
@_date: 2014-10-28 09:07:45
Of course it was a fraud. Who do you think the bear whale was?
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:08:57
We should certainly be working harder to fire every politician who denies scientific evidence. 
Funny thing about science is that you don't get to have "beliefs".

What country are you in?
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:47:29
hmm yeah good theory, I could see that.
@_date: 2014-08-21 06:27:48
Yes, this is silly. It is great that overstock accepts Bitcoin, and even better that they keep some of their assets in BTC. That doesn't make the store better than Amazon. It is quite simply not as good as Amazon. 
It is better if you only want to pay with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:46:17
I totally agree with this.
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:44:48


You must not be reading enough... of Luke-Jr. If you were, you would realize that "objectively" these are DoS attacks and that "there is unanimous agreement among Bitcoin experts that it is a good idea".
Can't argue with that.

A dog could own Bitcoin, as long as he is the only one with access to the private key.
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:34:31
He is a terrible person, and a cancer on Bitcoin. The fact that he has any kind of control over issues like this should be terrifying to all of us.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:24:03
I'm sure he used his smartphone to tweet that to the entire world via the internet. All gifts from God, of course.

Good questions, definitely worth an upvote.


No, it works well. One suggestion: make sure you use some form of 2 factor authorization with Blockchain.info. If you don't have a yubikey, use google auth or even SMS. Blockchain.info has all the best options. 


Yes, exactly right. Unless of course Blockchain.info somehow sweeps all the coins from the addresses who's private keys are on their servers... but they are an open company and that almost certainly would never happen. As long as you have the private key, you can use the address.


Your instinct is correct, there is no need to backup your wallets unless you add additional addresses (or of course if you somehow lose your existing backups). Make sure you keep them in a safe place, and encrypted.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:07:38
100% because of the influence of fossil fuel corps and other major polluters. They know they can muddy the waters enough to give the republicans enough cover to prevent doing anything about it.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:01:11
haha no kidding... 80+ comments... +1 point! 
@_date: 2014-08-28 03:41:52
Funny you should pick that number, personally for each 100 I've created two laminated paper wallets, plus an encrypted SD card, and put them in three separate safety deposit boxes that only my wife and I have access to. There are no copies at my home or anywhere else. Of course the wallets were made with a computer that has never been and never will be online in any way. 
I have never tested any of my offline addresses, so I am trusting that Armory didn't make a mistake, and neither did I. IMHO once you send anything from an address it is no longer a secure offline addy, even if you do an offline transaction with software like Armory.
The only way I could really lose my BTC and other assets (I also hold some LTC and a crapload of NCM in my boxes) would be the government or bank somehow seizing my boxes and stealing my Bitcoins, which is unlikely because I pay my taxes like clockwork and operate a legitimate business. 
Basically I am trusting the banks not to steal my coins, which when I think about it, is not the hottest idea. For a hardcore paranoid wanting even more security, you could use your own hidden, obviously fireproof, safe(s) at home or elsewhere. Although then you are open to a home invasion type robbery, which I think is more of a risk in this day in age than the banks shutting down and taking the security boxes.

For now. 
This Pancake dude and everyone else should sell what paycoins they have now before they become a pennycoin(tm).
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:21:08
Sorry for you personally and I sincerely hope it doesn't hurt too badly but everyone who lost money to this obvious scam has to blame themselves.
It was clear from jump street that this was a ripoff. As soon as you read that he lied about his Amazon partnership you should have bolted. Not to mention the "guarantee" of manipulating the market to maintain a $20 floor for a new pre-mined altcoin.

I agree that this is the dumbest shit ever. I had a payment with a 15 minute countdown that required 2 confirmations. It didn't make it, I had to email the site admins who had to email bitpay.
This isn't a problem with bitcoin, just a stupid setup by the billing companies.
@_date: 2015-01-12 04:32:50
Maybe worry about fixing bitcointalk.org before reddit! They aren't sitting on tens of millions of the community's dollars to do it!!!
@_date: 2015-01-08 04:35:06
What surprises me is how many of them there are.
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:51:30
I'll settle for Mark Karpeles. He stole hundreds of millions of dollars. 
GAW/Paycoin scam is way smaller, and way more creative.
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:23:58
Everything Google related is stalker-ish, I don't see why this would be any different. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:09:41
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:42:48
$20 floor and the lies about Amazon etc are the only reasons 99% of us have even heard of Paycoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:15:30
I guess we are just supposed to ignore this blatant fraud.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:32:16


...can't. tell. if. joking. or. serious.
Ever heard of anarchy? 
Real anarchy I mean, not overprivileged children screaming at meter maids.

What is Sarutobi?
@_date: 2015-01-08 12:28:18
...because as soon as miners start deciding who owns which coins, they all become worthless.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:29:58
Not everyone who uses Bitcoin is a 16 year old neckbeard "libertarian". It is actually amazing technology and has a number of positive real world advantages.

His name is ~~Robert Paulson~~ Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto.

I got in at 13, so it still feels pretty fucking good to me.
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:27:00
I can't believe anyone is investing in this guy's scams after he has been proven lying about having a relationship with Amazon and others.
Of course, people kept putting money into Mt Gox for about a year after it was shown to be an obvious scam, so I shouldn't be that surprised.
@_date: 2015-01-08 03:41:58
Yeah really. Still up almost 300% from when I first bought in.
@_date: 2015-01-08 11:42:05
It is like a cult. 
I read the thread about him (Garza) canceling his promised Q and A today... most people were unironically saying things like 'great! Smart move. Spend your time developing the services instead of answering crazy questions!'. 
I'm not joking. 
The 'umm maybe it's not a great time for you to be backing out of more promises' type comments were the minority. 
Word has it that us skeptics are only asking questions because we don't know how amazing Garza is and how much he cares about paycoin succeeding.
It's one thing to get conned, but it's pretty sad when people don't realize it AFTER it's happened. It's not just a few people either. I guess they are either desperate or in denial. I can't imagine all of them are sock puppets. After all, someone is still paying ~$4 for a worthless pre-mined altcoin that no one is ever going to use for anything.

No link to the evoorhees post? You bastards are going to make me work for five seconds?

...and the drug dealers killing eachother/fighting over territory, which is most of what gang violence is! 
On these markets they seem to have to compete using customer service and good products. The escrow system also prevents against scams and bad drugs. I am not a hard drug user (more of a drunk), but I tend to think these markets are great for society overall.

Well when you first buy a miner (or mining contract), it makes enough of a return that if you don't understand how much the difficulty rate is going to increase, it looks like it is going to be possible.
Say you buy a miner for 50btc, when you first start mining it may earn 1-2btc/day or some such, so it seems like there's a possibility you will make a positive ROI.
Then, as Pancake described, it drops off fast. So you may make 30BTC back in your first six weeks, but then you can mine for the next five years and it won't come close to making back the other 20btc.
It sounds like Garza/GAW took advantage of those types of low-information mining enthusiasts, and convinced them that they could make up their loses with his miracle guaranteed floor coin.

Really?
