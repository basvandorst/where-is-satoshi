I visited the D a few weeks ago and wasn't that impressed with how Bitcoin promotion was visible at the hotel. The only thing I noticed was the obscure sign and Bitcoin ATM I used near the side gift shop. A lady gave a glance over at the machine with a curious look.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:08:09
Positive news for Bitcoin which is becoming cash equivalent.
@_date: 2016-08-01 01:43:49
Hodl on Mr Byrne!
@_date: 2016-08-16 20:05:52
Good sign for Bitcoin in Russia 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:00:45
Nice looking Bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2016-08-02 14:30:44
Awesome. One more "step" towards Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:00:13
@_date: 2016-08-17 03:23:34
Buy it from miners over time.
@_date: 2016-08-19 15:02:03
India can skip credit/debit cards and go straight to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:06:55
Yeah. I hear Japan is gearing up for Bitcoin spending at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
@_date: 2016-04-03 01:28:36
I haven't been there but I'm planning to go after seeing the great reviews of the place. I also think hostels are great places to put Bitcoin ATMs with the exposure to young international travelers.
@_date: 2016-08-01 02:58:52
Awesome news! I hope more Bitcoin trading instruments come online in the next few months/years.
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:19:08
Don't forget the Brave browser and maybe something big from 21. Also the positive effects of the halvening haven't blossomed yet.
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:12:29
I wish more bars would accept Bitcoin. I hate ordering a drink in a crowded bar and having to wait for my credit card to clear or fumbling around for cash and waiting for change to get back. Meanwhile some impatient dudes are waiting to get their order in after you.
@_date: 2016-04-25 01:34:10
I hold Bitcoin directly but there are a lot lot new people that will become interested soon which is why I can't wait until the COIN ETF arrives (which I think will be this year). This will make it easier for a lot of people
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:01:35
Not to mention Bitcoin sitting in unused wallets that could get forgotten. I have a few wallets like changetip and Bitcoin debit cards with small numbers of satoshis sitting in unused accounts. Multiply that by a number of users and that could add up. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:29:17
Simple hint: Don't trust women!
@_date: 2016-04-27 02:35:09
This is big. Why wouldn't the government want to use Bitcoin for payments over other options. We need to encourage these politicians to support Bitcoin. The more people understand they less they are likely to fear it.
@_date: 2016-04-26 03:12:55
This is perfect for a business like steam. I could see this making a big worldwide impact.
@_date: 2016-04-24 17:20:13
Bitseed is exactly what I was looking into. Seems incredibly easy and inexpensive for a nontechnical guy that hodls bitcoin like myself.
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:20:11
Bitcoin seems ideal for any data for sale/rent that needs to be downloaded or streamed.
@_date: 2016-04-27 02:36:15
This can be huge but would take a culture shift of the way Japanese use currency.
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:16:04
What the incentive for bitfury if the fees for each title are 5-10 cents? Unless I'm interpreting this wrong. Maybe that's just the fee to put it on the Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:18:52
Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:16:35
$7B is so tiny in the financial world. So much more gains to be made for a world currency! All it needs is time. 
@_date: 2016-04-26 03:16:46
Huge vote of confidence in Bitcoin by Japan!
@_date: 2016-04-27 02:46:17
Good news. I'm in California and love my shift card. I just hate needing a high balance for fuel purchases. Is that normal?
@_date: 2016-04-27 02:43:28
This further legitimizes Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:00:16
I don't know why everyone thinks WU getting involved is bad. I think it's great and a vote of confidence in Bitcoin. This is the way Bitcoin gets to the mainstream (and to the moon).
@_date: 2016-04-24 00:27:55
Thanks all with your responses. I think I will finally join the node network
@_date: 2016-04-03 01:30:46
This gives alot of credibility to Bitcoin. I hope to see the success of the governments accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:21:26
We need to make it easier for kids to have Bitcoin wallets. They are the future of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-04-24 20:56:04
All we need is one major country to accept Bitcoin on par with cash and it will legitimize Bitcoin in a huge way. Surprising that this is the same place as Mt. Gox. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:47:30
How much would the COIN ETF increase Bitcoin price if it were to come out this year (in your opinion)?
@_date: 2016-04-25 02:22:00
Any guesses to how much this will affect bitcoins price?
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:06:56
December was an exciting time. Wake up and make the big bucks $$$. Hard to sleep with all the excitement. Like waiting for Christmas Day to open your presents. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 12:49:05
Uphold supports Bitcoin too! Great news.
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:19:07
Yup. Adoption grows bigger everyday. This train can't be stopped! I wish I could fast forward five years.
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:43:36
This is why the winklevoss ETF is needed pronto! 
@_date: 2015-12-09 11:50:38
Wow! Good to see Bitcoin use in North Korea!
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:41:04
Baby steps. Baby steps. This is great news and a vote of confidence.
@_date: 2015-12-09 02:45:44
Bingo. And with each day there is greater and greater adoption.
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:52:44
Nice compromise. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-09-04 20:12:47
I hope the Bitcoin candies are a permanent part of Walmart products. This is an underrated piece of marketing exposure for the bitcoin brand imo.  
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:35:25
I personally would like to see prepaid Bitcoin gift cards on store racks or for online purchase. Like what Bitit is doing. I would love to hand these out as gifts in place of gift cards.
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:55:14
This is great. I could see this situated among gift cards at stores and gas stations. Increased visibility helps adoption. I would consider giving these as gifts to coworkers, friends and family.
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:24:41
This is a good sign. We know it hasn't been rejected by now at least.
@_date: 2016-03-08 06:17:36
Openbazaar hopefully soon.
@_date: 2016-03-29 02:00:46
Wow! No Mt. Gox reference or anything negative. The tides have turned for the better.
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:56:27
With more adoption there should be higher prices especially with the deflationary nature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:31:34
This is how we get Bitcoin to the moon. Convert some of the gold investors into Bitcoin. Even a small percentage will be needed.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:33:00
I can't wait until all you need is Bitcoin for world travel.
@_date: 2016-03-08 05:54:50
We should push more gold companies to take Bitcoin payments. If gold holders divest only 1% into Bitcoin then each Bitcoin would be worth $3500!
@_date: 2016-03-19 05:27:14
Do you see Japan making Bitcoin a currency and using it in all the stores in the near future?
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:27:31
Looks beautiful and a good sign to see a Bitcoin ATM openly in Russia.
@_date: 2016-03-19 15:48:41
Nice. $2000 in 5 years. I'll take that.  It the final price will be higher because these numbers are JUST from gambling. Factor in sales transactions, hodling, remittance etc. and this number is way higher!
@_date: 2016-03-29 03:07:23
Good luck! I may attend. I hope you encourage using the Bitcoin blockchain!
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:15:03
Looks like the credit card companies might be warming up to digital currencies?! Positive news.
@_date: 2016-03-08 06:22:09
This is huge. Adoption really has a chance to flourish in SA.
@_date: 2016-03-27 04:04:46
I wish Bitcoin could get just 1% of the value of gold.
@_date: 2016-03-08 06:02:47
When Bitcoin goes to the moon this will be mine too!
@_date: 2016-03-29 02:53:37
I would be thrilled with just a tenfold increase. 
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:25:26
More ways to spend bitcoins is a win in my books!
@_date: 2016-03-27 00:21:36
Does anybody think that illegal drugs will ever be sold on it like silk road?
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:29:55
This is underrated and great news. Putting BTC among other national currencies further "legitimes" Bitcoin and puts more trust in it. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 05:00:31
That’s a great idea. I’m just an average joe without those technical skills though.
@_date: 2016-06-25 06:55:10
I know Bitcoin is going to be mainstream when I saw a positive Bitcoin article as the top news story on my USA Today news app.
@_date: 2016-06-03 05:13:17
Wow! Great video. We need more pro Bitcoin blockchain interviews from respected finance folks. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 01:06:19
I usually ask a question "do you take Bitcoin" via Twitter every few days to companies including Amazon. I'm sure if the Bitcoin community would do this as well it may pursuade them to look into accepting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-13 23:45:25
I can't wait until the COIN ETF!!! Let's get it done Winklevoss twins!
@_date: 2016-06-23 04:08:43
Last time I checked they hired an ETF expert to help them get this approved 
@_date: 2016-06-01 02:03:59
Nice. This will bring Bitcoin into the big leagues.
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:26:26
I hope they helped them find someone else to buy from and not totally shut them out!
@_date: 2016-06-25 06:57:07
Front and center on USA Today as well!!
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:54:08
Agreed! Can't wait until Bitcoin is a respected asset on Wall Street.
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:54:19
Wow. Colombia is a big country. Good news!
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:53:15
Does anybody know why Satoshi chose 21 million as the finite number? Why not 20 million or 22 million for arguments sake?
@_date: 2016-06-22 03:52:40
Cool! You gotta learn to walk before you run.
@_date: 2016-06-23 04:13:43
I'm still not sure what's in it for both sides and what this is leading to
@_date: 2016-06-04 03:35:44
I would love to see this replicated in every other country!
@_date: 2016-06-25 02:34:56
If the COIN ETF was here, it would be easier to get these Bitcoins indirectly.
@_date: 2016-06-04 20:14:33
I am holding (hodling) until at least 2020. That will be the third halving. By then the halving will decrease supply to 6.25 Bitcoin per block reward (the next halving will supply 12.5 per block) about every 10 minutes. In essence, the release of bitcoins will get tighter while demand should be higher causing increased prices.
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:15:36
Great news! More adoption opportunities!
@_date: 2016-06-22 03:56:30
Great work guys! Let's please get that $COIN ETF now!!
@_date: 2016-06-06 01:07:02
Buying Bitcoin is like buying the Internet.
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:52:57
Or use Bitwage?
@_date: 2016-06-28 01:16:58
Yeah. wow! Even I'm not that bullish and he's a Bitcoin insider
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:32:41
Are you talking about the SHIFT card from Coinbase? does that work overseas? I am using the SHIFT card but waiting until they get the chip card. There are a few places it won't work that require the chip. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:56:39
Just imagine a year from now! Articles like this give Bitcoin visibility and credibility in people's eyes.
@_date: 2016-06-09 01:48:08
Check out the Coindesk app.
@_date: 2016-06-01 02:00:35
Nice! So they sent this email to all their customers?! How many is that?
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:25:03
I see. So bitwage can save time by going directly to a different wallet than Coinbase. I use Coinbase as my hot wallet since I use it with the Shift Card but this is good to know if I want to save Bitcoin somewhere else. Thanks for the info!
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:48:23
Please do!!!!
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:09:34
Bitcoins itinerary 
Start: Earth
End: Moon
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:34:18
That's great news and makes sense. It's the 2020 olympics but I can wait until then. People are already using digital money when they swipe their cards and use online services. It will just take time to wean people into btc. This is a great way to do it if they are indeed trying to get people into btc and not just use their own bank digital currency.
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:55:54
Volume usually precedes price.
@_date: 2016-06-16 00:25:13
Global expansion by November 2017. Currently testing in the Philippines.
Good article from Coindesk. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:43:57
My how the tides have changed in bitcoins favor. Give this ecosystem a few years to develop and bitcoin will flourish!
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:52:53
Awesome! This is how Bitcoin becomes "mainstream". I hope we can get more positive articles in a major paper such as USA today!
@_date: 2016-06-07 00:51:50
I agree. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. If adoption happens, people will desire 1 Bitcoin even if it's thousands of dollars and there will be a "price" where people will be willing to sell. I know I have my price in my mind.
@_date: 2016-06-12 23:33:37
Looks like BIT-X is now Coinsbank. 
@_date: 2016-06-25 23:35:02
I just came from Taiwan on vacation and can vouch that family mart is everywhere. Can bitcoin be used for purchases there?
@_date: 2016-06-05 04:53:50
Japan is making Bitcoin on par with the Yen. Other countries will likely follow this lead. The next few years should be interesting!
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:14:37
I got in late to the game but have my share of bitcoin now. I always at least mention to my friends and family so that if/when I get rich I won't feel guilty. All of them have no interest but I will be the one to tell them "I told you!" in the future and won't feel the need to share my bounty.
@_date: 2016-06-08 02:14:41
Wait until strippers have Bitcoin qr codes on their body. Just what we need for mainstream adoption. lol
@_date: 2017-01-17 16:35:24
Haha. I was going to say that to me "the stock market is like legalized gambling."
@_date: 2016-06-03 01:23:21
Congratulations. I think this is great for adoption. Do you have any plans to expand to other countries? Perhaps SE Asia?
@_date: 2016-06-03 01:00:37
I would love to see this but imho Bitcoin might be seen as a threat to money exchangers. If Bitcoin were popular, money exchange might not be needed. You would just use Bitcoin in every country. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 01:03:35
I used my first Bitcoin ATM at the D Casino in Vegas last weekend. Agreed that it was very easy to use but of course costs more than Bitcoin exchanges. Great visibility though. I noticed one lady examining the machine as she walked past it.
@_date: 2016-06-07 05:14:22
Seem a lot of those companies are out of business now? I haven't heard of some of this companies. Outrageous predictions at the time which got me excited back then.
@_date: 2017-01-17 23:18:52
Seems like it. I'd hate to get scammed.
@_date: 2016-06-03 05:15:23
Yup. He looks very "locked in" during the presentation! Great work on Andreas part (as usual)!
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:16:00
I have to say it. "Two Weeks!!!"
@_date: 2017-01-16 22:10:26
This is how Bitcoin gains credibility in the finance world.
@_date: 2016-06-04 00:43:45
This is such an underrated fact about Bitcoin. Serious investors (i.e. Whales) should take note. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 11:12:51
And Bitcoin is still going UP!
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:42:16
This is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 18:17:49
Nice work!!
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:12:11
Does this gas station accept Bitcoin for gas at the pumps?
@_date: 2017-01-01 12:45:46
Fortune favors the bold! Your young enough to recover if something goes bad (but it most likely won't). You'll also regret more things that you don't do than those you do in life.
@_date: 2016-06-19 21:38:25
Could anybody please summarize in English what was said in this news segment? Was it positive or negative in general?
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:18:27
You can order from bitseed.com. I did and it was super easy for a computer novice. It's plug and play.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:46:19
@_date: 2016-11-14 20:17:22
I hope Satoshi applies for the job!
@_date: 2016-11-12 22:29:54
And what about the other ETF with the SEC review?
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:47:07
We should all ask and show interest in using Bitcoin on the Airbnb CEO's Twitter thread!
@_date: 2016-06-20 05:39:55
I love you site but where is Spain and why is there inconsistent updated dates for each country? Seems some get updated weekly and some every two weeks. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 16:47:02
Yeah. I just asked my friend after his trip to Tokyo last month if he noticed Bitcoin around. He had a picture of this billboard in his Shibuya Crossing photos but he only really noticed a Bitcoin ATM in one of the stores. Kinda disappointing news considering Bitcoin is legal there.
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:57:12
Yeah, I remember this time last year. $6000 Bitcoin would have us jumping in the air celebrating. Now it feels like a kick in the nuts. lol.
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:27:16
Does futures trading increase the price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:53:16
What area of the airport is that. Seems like the arrival/baggage claim area?
@_date: 2016-11-14 16:45:34
That actually a great idea! 
@_date: 2016-11-12 13:23:37
Thanks for the info! Will the central bank use Bitcoin in any way?
@_date: 2016-11-13 19:25:49
How close are we to this realty coming to fruition? Btw, great work so far!
@_date: 2016-12-26 10:12:37
Just 1% of the gold market puts Bitcoin at $3500+!
@_date: 2018-06-30 20:55:40
Haha. Looks like she is trying to cover up. Maybe thought you were a perv? jk
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:07:53
From the Coinstar website:
”With nearly 20,000 kiosks worldwide, Coinstar kiosks are easy to find and use. In fact, 90% of the U.S. population lives within five miles of one. Each year, Coinstar processes 43 billion coins, helping customers turn their loose change into cash, a NO FEE eGift card, or a charity donation.”
Huge news IMHO!
@_date: 2016-12-21 20:25:38
Great point! I'm happy where Bitcoin is at in this place in time. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 02:46:36
Does anyone know “why” this is happening?
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:54:03
From Coinstar: “With nearly 20,000 kiosks worldwide, Coinstar kiosks are easy to find and use. In fact, 90% of the U.S. population lives within five miles of one.”
Huge IMHO!
@_date: 2019-02-16 01:55:26
This is a huge step IMHO. Not only do you have governments working with Bitcoin but this could be the catalyst for other countries using Bitcoin for international trades. Baby steps.
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:58:18
Awesome! I wonder if people will pressure the grocery stores to accept people’s newly acquired Bitcoins! Anyways, good exposure regardless. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 12:08:19
I wish more Currency Exchange places had Bitcoin ATMs or traded Bitcoin for Fiat. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:20:31
Alright, this is crazy guys!!!
@_date: 2016-09-07 03:09:13
Great news!!
@_date: 2016-09-03 06:29:13
Nice work!
@_date: 2016-09-07 16:01:10
Yes. Please get some photos and more info about this machine.
@_date: 2016-10-05 18:56:12
I will continue to HODL!!
@_date: 2016-10-14 19:43:15
As bullish as I am on Bitcoin, I don't think this is the right place to get this kind of advice. With that said, you and only you (unless you have a spouse) should make that decision IMO.
@_date: 2016-10-05 19:04:00
I wonder what their incentive or motivation is for doing this. To be cool?
In any case I'm ecstatic. Redbull CAN make Bitcoin cool for the youthful future bitcoiners.
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:03:31
This should really help the adoption of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 12:27:32
And openbazaar is going active this month!
@_date: 2015-11-30 03:47:56
Perhaps. But I believe it's just a matter of time until a country does.
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:21:04
Yup. THREE years is a long time to wait. But they're already filthy rich and don't even need to work.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:30:24
Awesome work! Much respect and thanks!
@_date: 2015-11-26 17:50:39
Best way to support Bitcoin is for them to help increase the adoption and price of Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:32:00
So much good new these days. I like!!!
@_date: 2015-11-20 01:30:02
I'll be one rich mofo!
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:45:37
Ouch $1000?! Openbazaar can't come soon enough
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:42:28
Nice! Brazil, India, China is what we need to get on board the Bitcoin train! Such big populations!
@_date: 2015-11-21 01:19:56
I'm getting one but I think the $10 fee for the card could be lower.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:18:58
I can't wait until this is implemented!
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:34:50
Awesome avenue for mainstreaming Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:52:38
I can't wait to see the price when I wake up in the morning!
@_date: 2015-11-03 10:49:10
Translation please??!
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:25:46
He's asking for a bailout like the banks did. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 11:11:55
Yeah, this is the biggest thing I'm looking forward to. Openbazaar is another thing and coming out this month.
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:48:27
Imagine when the COIN ETF is active someday!!
@_date: 2015-11-06 04:36:39
Thank you for helping with Bitcoin adoption!
@_date: 2015-11-29 07:01:53
I think this would be a great way to reduce the supply of btc and drive up the price of Bitcoin. People would have to have about a $1000 worth of Bitcoin to pay their rent...I used to wait until the last day to pay my rent. This would be so convenient as well. 
@_date: 2016-05-15 03:21:14
India has huge potential for Bitcoin if regulations are favorable!
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:49:32
Cool. Can't wait to get one. Glad you left room on the screen for when Bitcoin goes to the moon. I want to see those digits fill out the left side of the screen. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 04:29:28
No, I meant if Bitcoin took a bigger share of the gold market. Even 1% would mean $3,500 a Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:32:12
Doesn't this help the COIN ETFs chances of getting approved soon as well? I really hope so!
@_date: 2015-11-16 01:25:42
Can anyone provide a list of gambling site that DONT accept Bitcoin? I'm a non-gambler but would like to email these site and encourage them to do so. This and gold markets are areas where Bitcoin could flourish IMHO.
@_date: 2016-05-24 00:50:49
Why isn't there a ETN in America? Seems a lot easier to accomplish than an ETF.
@_date: 2016-05-10 02:43:11
We should celebrate by burning bitcoins! I will help decrease supply permanently!
@_date: 2015-10-31 14:17:53
Silk Road version 2 (decentralized this time)
@_date: 2016-05-23 19:25:01
Just 1% of the gold market would be about $3,500 a Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-05-23 04:35:36
Good luck!
@_date: 2016-05-29 23:30:29
And PayPal just submitted a patent for a Bitcoin wallet!
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:22:31
What is the price of Bitcoin as the 6th largest reserve currency?
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:32:43
I can't wait to see when things are switched and Bitcoin becomes the main account and fiat becomes the "other account"!
@_date: 2015-11-08 20:37:59
Imagine just capturing a fraction of 1% of the gold market
@_date: 2016-10-04 16:06:56
Wow! Bigtime endorsement from a billionaire hedge fund manager.
@_date: 2015-11-29 19:36:26
Good luck with your venture! I would love to see at least one country (no matter how small) to adopt Bitcoin as their currency or used commonly. 
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:51:13
Good point but I think we'll solve that problem in the future!
@_date: 2016-05-27 03:51:47
Could potentially speed up some Bitcoin transactions?!
@_date: 2016-05-10 03:02:42
They should take Bitcoin donations!
@_date: 2016-05-27 05:21:01
Continuation of their original application from November 2014. Hence the Bitcoin, litecoin &amp; dogecoin I presume.
@_date: 2015-11-03 04:54:04
The COIN ETF can't come soon enough!
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:44:03
Can't wait. Let's get this Bitcoin train churning!
@_date: 2016-05-27 03:53:30
That would be my best guess. Although there seems to be a lot of other positive news as well.
@_date: 2016-05-12 04:13:20
Baby steps towards mainstreaming Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-05-03 18:39:42
How much do you think this will drive up the price of Bitcoin in the short and long term?
@_date: 2016-05-27 00:59:14
That's a long and expensive cable!
@_date: 2015-11-09 05:29:55
If Bitcoin just took 1% of the $7 trillion gold market......
@_date: 2016-05-12 02:31:13
Wait until Japan legalizes Bitcoin. Watch the dominoes fall!
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:44:31
The tides are turning to Bitcoins favor in a very fast way!
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:36:16
Good news. Baby steps towards mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 04:10:57
I think so too but I'll still be celebrating!
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:54:01
I dream we get to this valuation!
@_date: 2016-05-27 03:50:24
They probably submitted this a long time ago
@_date: 2015-10-30 02:20:25
God job! I hope you get the opportunity to write many more Bitcoin articles. Thanks you
@_date: 2016-05-16 03:36:49
I bought a few Bitcoin for friends and family that I am hodling until Bitcoin goes to the moon. I'm hoping that 1 Bitcoin will be worth $10k+ and will be a good gift.
@_date: 2016-05-16 03:33:33
The next halving is when I hope a lot of us are filthy rich!
@_date: 2016-05-11 23:56:29
Id say it will come out late this year. Q4. The winklevoss twins likely know it will be approved at some point or they would have given up.
@_date: 2016-05-28 01:01:21
Can't wait!!
@_date: 2016-05-16 03:47:31
Great work. I think you guys are underrated in your help in getting Bitcoin adopted mainstream.
@_date: 2016-05-12 02:59:03
I hope when you buy, you hodl!
@_date: 2016-05-11 23:54:33
Contact a big Bitcoin mining company and try to buy it directly. This way it won't pump up the price for you. I hope your legit though. I could care less about a temporary pump in price myself since I'm a long term hodler.
@_date: 2015-10-25 18:18:46
Yes, this would be great for Bitcoin. Changetip should get on this!
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:14:28
Yeah. It's a mararathon not a sprint and a good "first step"!
@_date: 2016-05-16 03:46:04
I heard smartphones can be bought for $5? Maybe preload these phones with Bitcoin wallets filled with satoshis or help subsidize these phones.
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:35:35
Why not create a similar site that uses Bitcoin and can't be shut down?
@_date: 2015-11-30 02:10:28
I don't see why a small country wouldn't take a chance and implement Bitcoin. They would have first mover advantage while Bitcoin is still "cheap". A country taking Bitcoin would legitimize it. Best of luck!
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:36:55
I just watched it too. Just getting people used to hearing "Bitcoin" will get it moving towards mainstream adoption. It makes seem less like "funny money" IMO.
@_date: 2016-05-05 04:23:26
What do we say to the God of To The Moon? Not today
@_date: 2016-05-26 18:43:19
Bitcoin is GLOBAL. Either join in or get lost in the dust. Japan already made Bitcoin on par with the Yen. Other countries will follow.
@_date: 2016-05-10 02:45:37
Bitpay is killing it everyday!
@_date: 2016-05-12 01:07:19
Nice vote of confidence in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-05-27 05:24:56
I thought the micropayments were due to start around now?
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:00:25
I know it's blockchain agnostic but are they planning to use the Bitcoin blockchain for now?
@_date: 2016-05-30 10:37:29
Not bad for a place where Bitcoin is almost illegal.
@_date: 2016-05-30 21:54:53
I can't wait until more Bitcoin derivatives come online. Likely by the end of the year!
@_date: 2016-05-12 01:27:20
They want to tax it!
@_date: 2015-10-25 18:11:04
Yes, now is a great time to buy. Supply is decreasing and demand is increasing. The law of economics says the price will increase in the future.
@_date: 2015-10-15 05:16:00
I like the part about preloading smartphones with fractions of bitcoins. I thought the same thing. Imagine how fast adoption could happen.
@_date: 2016-05-28 01:02:59
Cool! Now how do we get the other 99.99999999% of goldbugs buying Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:01:39
Nice work! I saw your original post asking them to add it about two weeks ago. I do believe you were instrumental in making this happen (and happen fast). Again, great work. We need to to do the same with other retailers.
@_date: 2015-11-01 17:33:38
And preload these free smartphones with a few satoshis! Even $5 worth of Bitcoin in each phone. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 04:59:00
Yeah, thats what I meant (the next halving in 2020). Bitcoin will either be big or be dying off imo. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 02:54:36
We just need a small fraction of the gold market and we'd be rich!
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:03:51
Translation please?
@_date: 2016-05-21 15:48:28
Thanks for this insight. Russia is such a huge market for Bitcoin and I'd hate to see a ban. One thing that interests me about adoption there is the tremendous growth of interest on the localbitcoin charts.
@_date: 2016-05-10 03:01:50
"Make Bitcoin great again!" Donald Trump
@_date: 2016-05-15 03:20:23
Offer to setup some Bitcoin wallets and send satoshis to newbies!
@_date: 2015-11-03 10:57:55
Approximately $2500 by my estimation. The market cap of PayPal 
@_date: 2016-05-30 21:57:04
Let's work on evening out that ratio!!
@_date: 2015-11-03 22:39:25
Awesome! What a huge vote of confidence. This shows that USAA believes in Bitcoin (and not dash or nxt etc. but Bitcoin) and that this will last. 
@_date: 2016-05-13 17:40:14
The failure of R3 would be one the greatest things to happen for Bitcoin IMHO.
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:22:23
Even more impressive if converted to Zimabwe dollars!
@_date: 2015-10-20 00:15:17
Exactly. Just preload these phones with $5 worth of bitcoins. Adoption would ensue!
@_date: 2015-10-30 23:00:27
Why don't we just go after and advertise on gold marketplaces? If we capture just 1% of this market it would make a lot of people here rich!
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:08:02
Justifying watching porn to support your investment in Bitcoin. I like it.
@_date: 2015-10-31 04:18:25
Nice way of spreading adoption of Bitcoin with customers!
@_date: 2016-05-13 02:03:28
These twins are billionaires. They'll get r done!
@_date: 2016-05-25 02:09:37
Why not both??
@_date: 2016-05-06 03:44:05
My guess....Waiting for the SEC to feel comfortable with approval. The SEC has little to gain and a lot to lose riskwise. I feel it will get approved sometime late this year though. The twins are still pushing for approval so there must be a good chance in the near future. Winklevoss - I know you read Reddit, so I want to say "lets do this"!
@_date: 2015-10-31 14:14:57
You can donate bitcoins on their website! I did
@_date: 2015-10-12 00:25:31
My first post ever on Reddit. I've been following these threads for about two years slowly watching adoption grow. I am locked and loaded with my btc and hodling for a few years. I agree that localbitcoin volume is the best measure of adoption. It's great that adoption is growing and "decentralized" among various countries in the world.
@_date: 2016-07-31 00:12:58
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:50:57
Yeah. I worry that there may be some immature and bad comments made by redditors. The risk of getting unknown comments might not be worth it. I wouldn't mind Pro-Bitcoin professionals commenting though.
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:00:14
ALOT more people know about Bitcoin and have more access to buy it! We could be in for an even bigger rise than 2012!
@_date: 2016-07-20 03:56:56
Maybe it's been lost?
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:06:59
Is this guy known for going to Starbucks and getting Frappuccino's? I see so many comments about it. 
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:44:02
Glad there is more filings (i.e. action). I speculate this ETF will be approved by the end of the year, if not next month, I hope!
@_date: 2016-07-01 23:13:48
This is great news. While it doesn't guarantee that the ETF will be approved, it does put pressure on the SEC to make a decision or kick the can down the road again and again. This way it forces action on the SEC's part and places the ball in their court. Let's cut the twins some slack. At least their trying to make this ETF happen (which is not easy with such a new and different asset class)
@_date: 2016-07-10 01:15:50
Yes, if history repeats itself from the 2012 halvening, we are in for a BIG ride. I expect this to happen around Thanksgiving.
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:25:35
I'll take that! Will history repeat itself?
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:06:01
This is awesome. I hope this kind of news spreads across the world. We need to make it easy and cheap for people to access and buy bitcoins! Visibility about Bitcoin is always good too!
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:08:39
Yup. I googled pictures. Actually looks decent, healthy and something I might pay for in a restaurant. A lot of side dishes. Rice, vegetables, brothy soups.
@_date: 2016-07-10 18:33:19
I think this is great. They will be placing these in high traffic areas. i.e Major transit stops and major hotels.
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:34:08
I'm sure they're reading this with a huge grin on their face though!
Thank you twins!!
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:55:49
I'd hate to see Silk Road references.
@_date: 2016-07-02 03:00:07
Brad is a genius with the exchange he started. 
@_date: 2016-07-13 18:04:47
We need to get these Hollywood producers/directors/actors aware and even interested in Bitcoin. Hopefully in the future there will be more Bitcoin visibility on movies and shows. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:38:33
Yeah, I liken it to going to 7-11. It may cost slightly more than the supermarket but its alot more convenient sometimes. More options is good.
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:50:56
Mr. Voorhees. I'm mainly bitcoin but this is a cool feature as well
@_date: 2016-07-16 00:54:53
I understand what your saying. If there's a "problem" it would be with the merchants and the fees they have to pay to process payments as well as the "wait" for payments to settle back into accounts. Bitcoin can obviously help with this. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:53:47
I'll take $3000 in two months!! No complaints here! lol
@_date: 2016-07-30 20:06:14
Man, I hope so!
@_date: 2016-07-17 02:50:05
That's what I'm talking about! Getting big money on onboard.
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:03:23
I think the effects take a few months to take affect. The decreased supply finally catches up with the demand and drives the price up!
@_date: 2016-07-19 02:47:44
Bicoin is only a $10.6B asset. It's so microscopic for a global investment.
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:06:56
As long as there aren't negative comments this is a good thing. iMO it's a lot better to not have negative comments rather than to have positive comments. 
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:43:18
I heard that Japan wants to feature Bitcoin in time for the 2020 summer Olympics?
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:32:57
Nice. The rise after the last halvening happened a few months later. This might get approved at just the same time!! Time for me to get a stronger seat belt for the ride to the moon!
@_date: 2016-07-02 16:10:29
Maybe I'm not understanding, but doesn't your BTC automatically move to your CB hot wallet when you withdraw from your Vault wallet which enables you to do your test? 
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:07:01
This will eventually lead to banks trusting and using Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-07-29 01:40:20
Probably BTC and ETH
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:58:09
Nice! lol
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:18:59
Find out how to sell them newly minted bitcoins outside of exchanges to limit slippage. A whale buying 1000's of bitcoin on an exchange would drive the price up (which I would actually like)
@_date: 2016-07-10 05:44:10
Interesting. I wonder what the deal is here or if this will delay potential approval.
@_date: 2016-07-17 02:39:03
Baby steps....
@_date: 2016-07-19 02:39:19
The Bitcoin halvening will have the biggest impact. Don't forget the Bitcoin ETFs approvals which I anticipate happening by the end of the year. But the Bitcoin halvening will have the biggest impact because a lot of coins are bought from miners. Once the supply dries up the big buyers will be forced to buy coins on exchanges and drive the price up. Here's a good explanation.
@_date: 2016-07-28 02:23:00
How close is this until it's fully implemented and used by everyone?
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:38:51
Each day Bitcoin survives it gains people's confidence. Gold has proven itself for thousands of years. As much as I wish Bitcoin can replace that trust, I don't see that happening in the near future.
@_date: 2016-07-24 04:38:31
$2000-$10,000 a Bitcoin if the COIN ETF is approved?! 
I'll take it!
@_date: 2016-07-14 03:26:38
@_date: 2016-07-16 17:32:45
How much will these Bitcoin ETF affect the price of Bitcoin the currency? Are we talking $1000's increase?
@_date: 2016-07-28 06:41:24
I don't have any suggestions but thanks for spreading the word and good luck! I think you are on the right track.
@_date: 2016-07-02 02:53:51
Yup. When big Wall Street money gets into Bitcoin then it's "to the moon"
@_date: 2016-07-12 06:02:58
Same here! Time to get some Alts switched back to the king of all coins.
@_date: 2015-11-16 04:39:38
Thx. Yeah, fandual and draftkings would be perfect for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-07-27 01:06:17
My question is how much does the Bitcoin ETF's increase the price of Bitcoin if/when they are approved?
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:21:58
I think the SEC is more worried about addressing negative comments. I work in government and negative comments are taken seriously. They have a lot more weight than positive comments. Basically, government is looking for reasons to say "no". 
@_date: 2016-07-19 03:25:15
I'm all in on Bitcoin but I'm assuming investing.com is a major investing website. Great news!
@_date: 2016-07-26 01:29:50
So "What is Bitcoin?". To be clear. Mainstream is knocking!
@_date: 2016-07-13 16:02:05
Nice. A trezor is pretty much a bank in your pocket.

Here's the official online SEC comment form for the COIN ETF.
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:49:39
So is there less incentive for me to host a bitcoin node in this situation?
@_date: 2016-07-14 03:20:03
Yup. When we make it big in Bitcoin, I'm getting one of those toilets in every bathroom of my mansion.
@_date: 2016-07-01 20:00:56
Yeah, seems like a nontechnical degree in which you can learn by self study.
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:28:39
"We're the SEC and our favorite game is Kick the Can!!"
Probably the farther they can kick the can is like a monster homerun in baseball.
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:30:06
Thanks for sharing this link! I'll keep an eye on it. At least the first comment is positive!
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:28:56
So was this solely due to the halvening? Or was there other factors at play? If it was due to halvening, I think history will repeat itself. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 17:37:17
Can one get a job in the digital currency industry from getting this degree? I might be interested if there is a payoff but I have a undergraduate degree that is an unrelated discipline and have no experience in this field. I know a CS or computer related major would probably be more beneficial.

I spent two weeks in Japan and was amazed at how little they eat. Simple side dishes we have in America were full meals there. Such as side rice dishes, bread, soups etc. A few months of this will definitely make you lose weight. Not to mention you have less options of eating high calorie cheat meals such as McDonald's, KFC etc. at every corner. 
@_date: 2016-07-20 03:54:28
Maybe it's been lost?
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:20:02
The good news is we have TWO etf applications in review right now. The other one being on the NYSE.
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:41:26
Well the SEC has been reviewing this for 3 years. I hope they know what their decision is unless they're just trying to buy time.
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:53:17
Good for him/her! I hope that's me someday!
@_date: 2016-07-13 22:55:55
This was just answered from the Brave founder..
   In alpha test now (some non-Brave users on board). We will open it up to beta soon, August time frame, grow from there.
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:24:02
Wow! This could pay off big for Bitcoin in the future. Getting the young bucks on board with Bitcoin can change the growth in a positive way.
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:15:02
Get that girl a Bitcoin! She can retire at high school graduation and never need to work.
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:38:09
Yes, but was the price increase primarily caused by the effects of the halvening? I say yes.
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:50:38
Man. That COIN ETF can't come soon enough! Let go twins and SEC!
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:56:47
Way too complex and technical for me to understand but it sounds good for bitcoin. lol

Everyone please post POSITIVE comments for the SEC if you do!
@_date: 2016-07-12 03:28:53
Japan is becoming a big player. Bitcoin will be on par with the Yen as a currency!
@_date: 2016-07-16 00:04:55
So much grey area for Bitcoin. Is it a currency? A commodity? It's not a "physical" item yet it has value and requires a money transmitter license. I love Bitcoin but the legality is not black and white.
@_date: 2016-07-10 18:30:09
Alot of big funds won't touch OTC stocks.
@_date: 2016-07-19 01:13:04
Keep both eyes on Bitcoin and hodl it with a Kung Fu Grip!!
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:58:16
Any guesses on how much the Bitcoin price will be when the ETFs are approved?
@_date: 2016-07-14 16:25:40
That's what gives me faith that Bitcoin is going grow big soon. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 11:44:16
Nice work! This is exactly where we need bitcoin ATMs. At all major airports across the world.

Agreed. I'm thinking of letting our Pro-Bitcoin evangelists know.
@_date: 2016-07-10 18:31:51
I think this could be a great second source of income for people and businesses. Similar to local bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-07-16 01:06:13
Wow. So if you bet 1 Bitcoin at a gambling site then that gives Coinbase permission to freeze an account with 100+ bitcoins? (For arguments sake)
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:29:35
Preach! I can wait! That penant in the charts is looking good for a breakout.
@_date: 2016-07-03 01:36:06
This is great! The twin have a chance to have the COIN ETF approved in a month and a half! Not saying it will but a decision will be made by then.
@_date: 2016-05-05 04:25:12
When you play the game of Bitcoin, you hodl or you die!
@_date: 2016-07-11 00:30:02
The COIN ETF has a lot more regulations from the SEC. GBTC is sold over the counter with penny stocks. This is why the COIN ETF is taking so long for approval.
@_date: 2016-07-14 06:11:58
I'm sure they're worried about Steemit.
@_date: 2016-07-04 23:07:38
Irrevelent now but I see ALOT of potential. Just gaining a fraction of some of these markets would make Bitcoin soar.
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:03:05
If only we could go back to this date in time! Looks like a crypto buffet and I'm hungry.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:56:57
I can relate. I've been telling friends and family for years and I either got silence or eye rolls which really bothered me. Now they feel like they missed the boat. I guess most of the public is scared to take risks. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:52:38
Vinny for the win!
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:20:26
Do you know if VPNs help with this?
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:49:14
Send your coins to another wallet, then to an exchange or gambling site to avoid being tracked. This kind of tracking made me want to get away from Coinbase. I buy coins there but move it to another wallet.
@_date: 2016-07-20 03:52:19
Yeah. As long as they are willing to pay the fees.
@_date: 2016-05-21 16:03:43
Is there a way this can be translated in English?
@_date: 2016-07-12 02:30:09
No guts no glory!! 
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:34:39
dry and constipated?
@_date: 2016-07-12 05:31:12
Bitcoin ETF in a couple of months. I have hope!
@_date: 2016-07-16 00:11:08
I've thought about this and maybe setting up a Bitcoin ATM at a farmers market/flea market. If anything to just get visibility about Bitcoin and get people curious and used to seeing it. I think putting signs or advertisements in newspapers/magazines would also be beneficial (especially in some gold publications). Just grabbing 1% of the gold market would mean $3500+ a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:19:03
Hahaha. I like it!
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:39:16
I hit my quota. Now I spend my time watching new development and hoping for more adoption. I guess this will all just take time.
@_date: 2016-07-31 05:49:31
@_date: 2016-05-28 01:40:49
I see it more like graduation. The benefits may not happen as soon as you get the diploma but the long term benefits can be huge.
@_date: 2016-07-08 04:39:13
Remind me to sell right before $8,500. lol
@_date: 2016-07-01 22:46:57
Good point. Not to mention the "learn by doing" approach is ALOT cheaper!
@_date: 2016-07-15 01:14:14
Thanks for all you do Andreas!
@_date: 2016-07-16 18:12:13
I suggest bitmixer.io. Make sure it's that exact address.
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:33:07
How does this work?
@_date: 2016-07-07 00:46:41
What is the forecast price for Bitcoin assuming these numbers?
A March 2015 report, “The Future of Cryptocurrency: Bitcoin &amp; Altcoin Impact &amp; Opportunities 2015-2019,” states that the number of active Bitcoin users “will reach 4.7 million by the end of 2019, up from just over 1.3 million last year."
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:58:45
$3000 will be the big milestone for the media to highlight which will push Bitcoin even higher from exposure. Love it!
@_date: 2016-07-12 06:04:42
Is there anything we can do to help, like make a public comment supporting this approval?
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:14:08
Hahaha. Up vote to that!
@_date: 2016-07-14 15:15:55
I wish I knew as well. I would love to make a positive comment but I'm just the average Bitcoin hodler here.
