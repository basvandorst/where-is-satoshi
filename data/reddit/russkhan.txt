Thanks, that's my first Bitcoins!

My other reply looks pretty unhelpful to your question. I was on my phone and actually thought you were replying to my comments in a different part of the thread where I had already mentioned the AES encryption of the KeePass database. 
Using KeePass does put all of your passwords in one place, which creates a single point of failure, as you pointed out. But it is encrypted with 256 bit AES, which is discussed in the article I linked in my other reply to you. The encryption is very secure, to the best of my knowledge. 
The major weakness is that you could lose access to the database in case of a hard disk failure or something similar. For this, I recommend a good back up policy. I recommend that anyway, even if you don't use KeePass. Put your KeePass database on a USB key, back it up to the cloud, and back it up along with the rest of your hard drive. This is a very important database and you don't want to lose it.

I didn't claim to understand it, I claimed to be puzzled. I'm interested, if you care to explain.

[This article from the folks who make 1Password]( is one of the better ones I've found on the subject of AES security.

1password is a password manager, Lastpass is a password manager service. 
Personally I recommend [KeePass]( an open source password manager.

I haven't quite figured out what this colored coin thing is, but count me in!
@_date: 2014-10-13 08:19:50
What's this about?
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:59:26
There are a bunch of extensions for it that all help with versatility. 
I'm not sure what you mean by host your own server. It's a simple database and an app that opens the database. You can put the database on your own server and use the app to access it, if that's what you mean. I keep mine in a dropbox folder, which allows me to get it from my phone, tablet, and any computers I use.

It is known.

I pronounce it doje-coin, but I'm probably wrong.

I'm guessing this is over, but here I am, just in case it's not.

I'll start using Bing when it gives me a bitcoin for doing a search.

I didn't realize this sub was popular among newborns. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:24:48
Just be sure to follow good back up policies.
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:55:05
Let me know when they're up to one bitcoin per search. that's my minimum.
@_date: 2014-12-10 05:05:35
Me too! Gimme!

If they were in the same country, OP probably wouldn't have brought up currency conversion.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say with the bit about making 1 plus 1 becoming 3, but AFAIK they don't need to change the math, they just need to throw enough processing power at it to crack the crypto. And I believe they have access to incredible amounts of processing power.

It's pretty puzzling. hover over the username (or click if yuou don't have RES) it says "User not found". But this must have happened after his last post in this thread, which was after the one saying he deleted the account. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:02:56
Because Thailand. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 16:42:12
I haven't really researched 1Password, but it should be an encrypted database, which if done right is very secure. 
I use KeePass and trust the 256 bit AES encryption and the open source nature of the program.

I accept Dwolla in my little business. I have a client who asked to pay by Paypal. I dislike Paypal and Dwolla had lower fees so I offered that option. So far only one client pays that way. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 04:56:29
Ha! Agreed.

No thanks. I don't mind that I'm out of the loop about the interesting ads.

This is the first time I've seen it.
