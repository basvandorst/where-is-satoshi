Who cares? It's bringing them to the sub. It's putting a foot in the door that otherwise wouldn't be there.  Some people take interest in something after they are brought there for another reason. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for making websites, finding a giveaway, and eventually reading enough to join the community. I understand that you are new and excited here, but your opinions are off par ad half your comments are flat out wrong or bad advice. Chill out on advice when you don't know what the fuck you are talking about at all.

Hows the conversation going

You are mislead in your marketing techniques. And wrong.

A vision for a completely free service where good will is the only thing powering the site. Sounds sustainable.
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:56:03
why are you reviewing services you havent used.  Misleading AF
@_date: 2019-11-30 18:58:54
Yup, it wouldn't be a bad idea, since tech and online design overlap, could imagine a good % of their userbase hold crypto

Bitcoin Beginners?  Been here since 2014. Ran multiple successful bitcoin businesses / websites since then.  Just wondering why you think a question of how to spend bitcoin in a certain place is for a beginner?  Because that's a dumbass assumption and you're wrong, this sub is for Bitcoin discussion, not memes and news.  Fucking idiot.

Did you write that review -
*- Trading interface looks very optimal for the ease of trading. It gives me a good feeling to start buying and selling here*
Doesn't USE THE EXCHANGE ONCE, SUGGESTS OTHERS USE IT.  WHAT A TRUSTWORTHY REVIEW SITE.
*-However, only certain countries have the option of using a payment card to deposit funds, and their respective fees are really expensive.*
\*All these comments and reviews are written by the same person.  And, well, nobody really cares about global access, they do care about access in their specific region. This is a comment added by the guy who wrote this article (you).  And not well done at all.
*- There support to the customers is very helpful. The FAQ page has almost every information about the exchange and solutions for most of the prolems that users may encounter.*
Clearly written by someone who has never traded on the exchange they are writing a review on, that's sad. Great advice.

Bro, that deserved a few more periods and less commas.  Thank you for writing me an essay.  Why you so angry.

They do have measurement of their experiences.  And there is a lot to it. Have you heard of the butt brush effect?  Consumer overload?  There's a bunch of theories that describe how our consumer behavior changes due to the setting, and options available.  A bitcoin option could have reduced other donations for sure.  To find out why or how, there's a lot more digging to do, but the correlation could 100% exist.  Maybe wikipedia's main donation stream was coming from a brand / business / entity that is threatened by the future of crypto.  There is so many influences, who knows what the correlation could be, but at the end of the day, if they put bitcoin up, and bitcoin donations weren't doing it, as well as, other donations down... Yeah, there's a reason.  
And Wikipedia has some smart people in charge, I can imagine they understand exactly what they are doing, and why they removed it, even though half the people in here who use Bitcoin and chirp all day probably aren't bothering to donate, or have any want to donate in any context.

Man you guys are super awesome.  The support for companies that basically have brought bitcoin to the value it is today is basically non existent.  Remember Bitcoin Bowl?  Which one of you were supporting Bitcoin then?  I can honestly go through countless examples of how they have brought bitcoin to the hands of those who otherwise wouldn't have any interest at all.  
The biggest college football bowl on Boxing day watched by how many people?  Thank BitPay for that.  These guys have changed the game for Bitcoin, and essentially brought a big % of it's value, and all you people do is sit in here and constantly talk shit about them.  Y'all can fuck yourselves TBH. Constructive feedback is one thing, sitting here talking shit and doing nothing to add to the ecosystem day after day after day is another. 
Fuck off.  What have you done lately for Bitcoin?  Risk millions on marketing to the masses?  Or did you just have a conversation with your Grandma to change the world?

Still going

You sound super angry bro.  Did you just walk through your life in that paragraph? You should consult some help maybe.  But actually, to think you know me, through a comment, and write like 200 words on who I am and how i act, really shows that you think you know a little more than you actually know.  Less words more actions, you clueless, assuming, dumb ass, bitch.
@_date: 2019-12-08 07:52:02
Fuck you're dumb.  Keep biting the hand that feeds your bitch ass.
