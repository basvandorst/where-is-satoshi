Gotcha, thank you for this explanation.  I did find out that Coinbase has a USD Wallet that seems like it might serve this purpose.  But I'm a little wary of their site as I've heard some stories of accounts being locked down without clear reason.

Blockchain technology means something specific, but like many other technologies it can be implemented and built upon in different ways.

I feel like this is comparing apples to oranges.  BitTorrent users do not have email addresses, or really any way for a company to directly contact them.  Anyone can become a BitTorrent user by simply installing software on their computer.  How are these companies planning to "tap into" BitTorrent users?  I don't really understand how this comparison is meaningful.
