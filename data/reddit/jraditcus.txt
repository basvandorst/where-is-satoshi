You’ll be looking back that you had the chance to buy at 10k and wish you had. Hindsight’s a bitch. If that $500 isn’t gonna put you in a bind, lock it in for the ride.

DCA is usually always the best option unless you cheat and have insider info. Then you can be like Martha and knit some sweaters in prison....

Just thought I’d give fair warning before I put my money into battle
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:22:26
Haha, no fomo here. I’ll watch the bag holders cash out as people think it’s a straight trajectory to the top.

But he won’t  because he watched the last rise and fall. He is in it despite price as am I. He fully understands what is taking place. He’s not a moon boy like half the people fomo’ing in right now talking about lambos. It’s a financial revolution.

There has to be a way. I would call them. If that was a thing they shouldn’t have allowed you to open an account in the first place. Don’t sweat it though. You let that money ride until your 18 you’ll likely have a very nice nest egg waiting for you:)

Can I get some of those shrooms?
@_date: 2019-06-22 15:53:01
Likely yes, but theoretically what if? The more scarce it gets, the more the price rises, the more fomo kicks in, the more institutions buy, the more important it becomes, the cycle continues. What happens when people really began seeing the evolution its going to bring? Sure it will drop, weak hands/whales, blah blah blah... but what if it doesn’t?

Or Facebooks announcement kicked some side-liners into gear and realized maybe they should get into Bitcoin before this space blows up. I know Libra is not really crypto but I think it’s a large signal to the direction companies and markets are moving into. Maybe some companies are hedging bets and buying Bitcoin on the sly, would not surprise me. No way huge corporations are gonna let FB get in there and own the digital space without fighting for it. How best to fight than to hoard the new digital gold.

It’s cause your debit card got declined. Most banks won’t let you purchase crypto’s.

I did this in 2017. I was chicken shit and only put in 3k, out of 80k profit. Bought in literally 2 weeks before it exploded to 20k. I cashed out at the top. It was my first exposure to bitcoin and trading. I paid off student loans and credit cards. I was young enough to gamble, had I put all 80k, my life would have been different today. Yet had I lost 80k and hodl’d myself down to the $3500 range, I would be living in my parents basement with my wife and two kids. Be wise, invest a chunk but pay debts first, have a 3-6 month basic bill emergency fund and invest the rest. Bitcoin is great but don’t put all your cash in one spot. One massive whale could cash in and leave you holding bags for a long time. Someday bitcoin will be worth 6 figures, but how long can you hold out if it retraces and leaves you broke with your balls up in your throat?

100% agree. It’s why I closed out my bank accounts. No one tells me how I can and can’t spend the money I earned.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:17:36
But theoretically, what if it didn’t?
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:25:04
Wise words, I never invest money I can’t afford to lose. That being said, no one likes losing. Profits are nice but I’m in it because I see the change Bitcoin is bringing to the world and I want to be part of it.

$20 bucks when I was 16 was like $1,000 to a working adult. Big props to you for being so young and forward thinking about the future and investing. Your gonna do well for yourself in life.
@_date: 2019-06-22 04:32:41
Does it really matter if I get in now or at 12 or 20k when Bitcoin will be 500k someday?
@_date: 2019-06-22 05:30:58
Hasn’t always been a false pump by tether? That and fomo. Whales profit, sell, cause panic and us plebs buy it up, asking for another beating.

He’s a Vengeful dick. He only decreases his price after you put your money in.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:25:57
I remember that feeling all to well. I was one of those back in the day who sold my house and bought bitcoin, right before the massive bull run if 2017. Risky, made money, don’t want that feeling again though.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:14:45
Right? The idea behind what’s taking place is much more valuable than price action. Just imagine if owing just a small fraction of a Bitcoin now put you in the top 1% in the future. The revolution is incredible. It’s unstoppable. Sure we will see cycles until we don’t and it’s more widely owned and dispersed. It would be like finding a pile of gold before it had much value and just hanging onto it. I’m in this to change my families future. I don’t care about catching highs and lows. Long term, this will change the world as we know it.
