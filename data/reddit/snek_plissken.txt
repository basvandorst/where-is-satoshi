I think i did trigger Automoderator, actually. I had to message a mod because my comment above wasn't showing, even after 4 hours. I understand it's an automated thing to keep spam away, and I can see how some people may interpret that as "being banned".

This would also be the case if someone from posted news about Openbazaar accepting B C H on this subreddit (I'm afraid to type that becasue I know it would trigger AutoModerator).
Sorry, but you're proving anything, you're just fueling the hate.
The other sub is about *CH and considers BTC an altcoin, this sub is about BTC and considers *CH an altcoin. If you see that, it's pretty normal for each sub to downvote posts about altcoins.

No, you're not wrong. That subreddit is bcash shill heaven. They're also lurking around here, spreading FUD and downvoting inconvenient things.

My wife has to live with MS, and since we live in a country where the public health system and research are underfunded, and the authorities just don't care, our only hope are the outside MS organizations and research, who are actively testing and researching new treatments.

you know you're asking for it, right?
You're on a subreddit that supports bitcoin, gee I wonder what the sentiment is :)
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:45:36
If you buy bitcoin to get rich, you're gonna have a bad time... What if bitcoin goes back to $7000 in a year? What if it never dips again?
People who usually invest in BTC believe in it, in the technology, that it's the future of internet money. People like you will panic the second the price goes below their entry point and sell at a loss.
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:05:31
Can you at least read the subreddit description? It's on the right, under the "Submit a new text post" button you pressed to write this shitpost ------------&gt;

Bitcoin drops 5% after being up 900% this year =&gt; "dark times"

There will always be ups and downs and no one really knows what happens and for how long. I just know that BTC is just getting started and this is not the end. This is not the first attack on BTC and will not be the last.
The moment I've invested in BTC I told myself that the fiat I've put in, is already gone. In the unlikely event that BTC drops down to $300 I'll be fine with it, because I firmly believe that crypto is the future, and BTC really is the internet's gold. Keeping that mindset helps me to deal with all these 'bumps' and not lose hope. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:41:54
what gives money its value? It's the same thing.
hint: it's trust. trust that the thing you're buying has value.
When you buy BTC, you're basically transfering trust from fiat to BTC. 
Doing that, trust in BTC increases. More people buying, more trust invested in BTC =&gt; bigger BTC value.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:16:04
well, I wasn't talking about you specifically, sorry if I made that impression.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:42:05
Welcome to the roller coaster. Enjoy your front seat. Some of us have been here for a while. Keep in mind that while the climb to $7000 is nice and the wind is cool, we'll also have bumps to $6300, drops to $4900 and people crying. Maybe a close encounter with $0, no one really knows for sure! Just keep yourself strapped in and enjoy the ride! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:08:04
yeah, altcoin = BCH. Used the "altcoin" term to avoid being muted by AutoModerator. Because of all the chaos, making a post with "BCH" in it will make it hidden by default and a mod will need to approve it.

We're just deluded because he's just "promoting other coins". No way his posts are an "attack" /s
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:24:47
That's it, man. Game over, man. Game over!
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:19:52
Going to another token's community and shitting on it because yours is better is not "promoting your coin", it's actually "shitting on that coin and on that community".
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:48:37
Because people supporting coin A don't normally invade a community for coin B and shit on everything. That was the point of my post.
Also the timing for this is pretty weird to say the least. Uncertainy with the 2x fork, pumping of BCH, BTC drops 5% and suddenly you have an army of people shitposting on /new and on every recent thread in this subreddit.

@_date: 2017-11-29 14:45:52
That means that you don't need to trust a central authority to send your money to a third party.
But BTC itself is a storage of value, which is meaningless if people don't trust it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:19:40


You somehow made this whole thread even weirder (for me as a non-english native speaker at least)

There is no 'too late' to buy. Bitcoin is just starting to enter mass adoption realm.
Also, don't buy 'as much as possible'. No one knows what will happen tomorrow (no one knew we we'll hit $7000 today). No one will know what will happen next week, next month, next year, etc.  It's all hopes and speculation.
Buy as much as you're comfortable with. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose and you should be fine.  
Buy, store in a safe place and forget about it for a year. Or better yet, make a habit and buy a small amount (again, as much as you're comfortable of losing) each week.

OMG it dropped $300 after gaining $4000 in the last month, it's all over!!!1
Seriously: close the charts and reddit and stop thinking about it. Come back in 1-2 months. You can thank me later.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:06:48
1. Don't trade more than you afford to lose.
2. Close the charts and forget you bought bitcoin for a couple of months.

Nah dude, it's my fault. 
I bought at $4200 then, BAM, $4050!
I bought again at $4000 and, BAM, $3850.
If you guys want a $3500 price I can buy again now...

1. User visits your online shop
2. He puts items in the cart then clicks on checkout
3. He fills a form, entering his delivery address and contact info, then clicks Submit
4. The shop registers the order, delivery and contact info, generates a bitcoin address and QR for it, assigns the address to the user's order, then displays the QR/Address to the user.
5. User scans the QR and sends the required amount to that Address.
6. Once a few confirmations come in, the order is marked as 'paid' and you can process it.

The first thing you need to solo mine bitcoin is a time machine. That way, you can go back to 2010-2011 when you could actually do it and actually get "coins in a single day".
 if you're really curious. Input your hardware, click "calculate".
If you really want to mine that, the easiest way is to download nicehash from the website above, and start mining. You will need to set a wallet address where you receive your coins in the nicehash app

BCH is doing 20k transactions/day, while BTC is doing 220k transactions/day.
But BCH is the one that's "usable"? Can't argue with that logic.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:30:23
Exactly. The other sub is filled with "ShopName is accepting BCH" and "Adoption!" posts, but that's not reflecting actual transaction rate. Their transaction/day rate is actually lower now than January this year... It feels like no one is actually "adopting" BCH, if you do a bit of research.

Dude, take it from someone who also lost money. If you invested in bitcoin, you're in for the long run. Don't expect fast and huge returns. The time for that has long since passed.
I bought 2 BTC when it was ~$1100. A friend recommended ETH, so I bought 50 ETH with my 2 BTC when ETH was $40. I watched ETH charts like a madman and when I saw that ETH started loosing ground in front of BTC I panicked and I sold my 50ETH for about 1.6 BTC. I'm not sure if I remember the numbers correctly, but I remember clear as day that I sold my ETH at a 0.4 BTC loss. A $400 loss. 
Like you, I panicked. Like you I told myself that it was payment for my own stupidity. An expensive lesson. 
Since then, I made a habbit of buying small amounts of BTC regularly. I buy $100 worth of bitcoins every few week, or every few days when there's volatilty, like now. I bought at $2700, at $2600, at $2200, and I'm going to buy more at $1500 if it reaches that price. In fact, I WANT it to reach $1500 so I can get more bang for my $100.
So my advice to you would be to learn your lesson. Learn to invest responsably. Learn about [dollar cost averaging]( to reduce risks.
As a sidenote, you know how much 50 ETH are worth today? $15000. Or about 6.5 BTC.
edit: corrected some numbers.
