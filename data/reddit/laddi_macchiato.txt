Doing your taxes will be a complete nightmare. You will have to register every single purchase and calculate the capital gain/loss on that.

Fake price created by Spoofy and unbacked Tethers:
Bitfinex is going to collapse soon, and it is going to be MtGox all over again

True, but a lot of the recent rally was caused by BTC being bought with Tethers (USDT). If it turns out that these Tethers were not backed by actual USD (which they aren't), people are going to realize that the price is that high mostly because of hot air. This might cause some serious panic selling, and nobody knows just how far the price will drop then.

Nobody wants to lend their BTC right now, because they would not receive any Bitcoin Cash then.

Could you explain why not please?

China please

Just hold, think about the long term potential. If the price goes up to 10000, you will be very unhappy about selling early

It depends on which country you are in. If you have a bank account within the EU, I would recommend bitcoin.de.
I don't know which one would be good for other countries, but I read good things about Kraken and Gemini before

I did not try to withdraw cash from cex.io, but I had very bad experiences with them before. You could convert your fiat currency to BTC and send them to a different exchange to cash out. I hope this helps!
