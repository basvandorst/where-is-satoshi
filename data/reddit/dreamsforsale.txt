It is always easy to judge trends in hindsight.
You will lose in the end trying to time the swings a volatile market. It has been proven statistically, again and again.

Wow, really? You mean if someone had perfect powers of timing in a volatile market they would make more money? You don't say!

That's not necessarily true. And what does it matter to Steve now anyway?

Regardless of the stated laws, no one in their right mind would give up their US citizenship when becoming dual. Unless you are afraid of the tax liability, I suppose.

I'm still right in saying it was not the "worst possible time" to buy.
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:23:12
Jeez, what have you been doing for the past few years? Why did you wait so long?
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:08:10
What an idiotic statement to make. The most recent "worst possible time" would be at the peak...$5k.

Yeah but who the hell wants to get involved with that? Having your name on mafia "favor" lists is not exactly a position a US ex-pat (or anyone) would want to be in.

It is fun for awhile if you are young and unattached, and you can learn a hell of a lot about the world. But many people who try this lifestyle burn out after awhile and settle somewhere. It's always good to have a backup plan and enough disposal funds if and when you get tired of being itinerant.

If we're *really* going to talk about bad decision-making...because of Steve's idiotic resistance to modern healthcare, he's been gone 7 years and Ronald (who was 20 years older than Steve) is still kicking.
So, who do you think got the last laugh?

Very very hard to residency there, and it has a very expensive COL. Good luck with that.

You realize that "clearance sale" implies a discount on a product that is being discontinued for good?

The biggest is probably the ability to come back to the US for employment at any time (or work for a US corp). Also, the US passport is still arguably the most valuable travel document in the world and practically guarantees easy entry into any country (minus a couple you probably wouldn't want to visit anyway...).
It's an enormous advantage that many many people spend their lives trying to obtain. Personally, I think you'd be foolish to give it up if you don't really have to.

Hey, come on now, some of those thinkpieces are written by people in Greenpoint and Bushwick too.
