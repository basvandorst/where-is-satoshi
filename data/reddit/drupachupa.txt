Idk about big huge miners that since got involved.  All I know is that before bitcoin was huge, when you could still mine a lot from home, very smart and connected folks knew the potential.  There is more but I can only speak to my experience and what I know.  Very smart connected folks knew it would inflate as it did.  They may or may not have other connections to other movements.

Yeah I’d rather get long at 9250 instead of now, if possible.  Then again who knows?  Just play it as it unfolds.  I’d buy now only if bitstamp breaks 14600 now.

Are we at “return to normal”? If so....

That’s good brother. Sadly others have put their family’s futures on the line, and if the musical chairs stop here, their “investment” enriched earlier adopters. “Greater fools theory”

Nobody gives a fuck about you or your lambo dreams, brother.  Btc could recover and rally to new highs or maybe it won’t. You have no control over that outcome and if anyone told you that btc always goes up guaranteed they are guilty of either malice or incompetence.

Sadly, money and power are still central to the science of modern day attraction.  This isn’t likely to change with   In fact it looks ready to sell off over 4000 points.
Bitcoin doesn’t improve social dynamics that cause “depression” and “suicide”.  Instead, unnatural hierarchies instilled into evolved apes gives people time to contemplate and act on suicide.

Just putting it out there, I’d get bullish if 14600 gets taken out on bitstamp.  Otherwise I’d watch out for a sell off to low 9000’s from here.

That’s great for them but no guarantee it’ll work going forward. In fact the climate seems different now. Wall Street involved, everyone knows about bitcoin. Not clear there will be the acceleration of capital influx needed to keep the party moving forward.
Never know when the bear hits and it looks uncertain here. I’m looking for 10k to hold on bitstamp.
