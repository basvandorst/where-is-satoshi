No matter how much of a reputation someone has built, cryptocurrencies are built upon the idea of decentralization. Massively large pools threaten this idea. It only takes two shady operators with over 25% of the network each to cause some major problems. Two points of failure is pretty ridiculous for something that is supposed to be decentralized. I honestly don't follow BTC mining too closely, so if BTCG is truly down to under 20% then sure, why not. Join up.

Oh, I completely agree. MSE is a total POS. 


Although this I'm not completely in agreement with. A file extension only tells the OS what program to open it with by default; I can still run a .jpg as an executable from cmd via 'start' (on Windows). Additionally, on NTFS file systems, you can hide malicious code within any file via alternate data streams (ADS). File extensions should never be used (exclusively) to determine if a file is safe or not.

That doesn't really mean much. If the signatures it's using are massively out of date, it'll still hog a ton of resources combing your system for malware, but it's not going to find anything it doesn't have a signature for.

Sapphires are far and away the best brand I've used outside reference cards. They had one bad batch during the height of the mining craze, but outside that, they've outlasted and outperformed my Gigabytes, MSIs, and PowerColors by far.
