I believe that isn't your seed phrase, but some sort of encoded walletid+password.  is the recovery link but I don't think it has worked since they migrated the site and broke a bunch of the underlying stuff, but the proper js files should be around on their git repo.

Paypal has plenty of competition. Square, Stripe, Venmo, Popmoney, Zelle, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Visa Checkout, Masterpass, Samsung Pay all compete with them in some specific sector or more broadly here in the United States. If Paypal was able to somehow shut down a competitor with government help in an artificial way, I'm not sure which company it was. I mean, they bought Braintree and Venmo, but both are still operating.

Paypal actively tries to close accounts of people they suspect of trading crypto on their account, so good luck with anyone who isn't in it for the short run.

There are a few sites that offer different ideas of how to visualize these things:
That said, most of these places don't have enough metadata to really make analysis interesting.

If you're talking about literally maintaining the system, you're looking for those who actually work on the code, from pull requests to maintaining documentation. [Those can be found here, of course](
There are also a lot of people who don't directly contribute to the codebase but work to improve the ecosystem, be it developing apps that can leverage the coin/blockchain in some way, or providing ways for people to understand and use the technology in some way. This goes all the way to people who host full nodes or Electrum servers or whatnot, since no coin can survive without a community that supports it.

The question is "anonymous to who". You can always use a registered agent to start a Delaware or Nevada LLC, have it own another entity which then opens a bank account where you can allow cash deposits.

Gotta get around those currency controls. The post-recession housing boom in the US was given a huge boost by Chinese grey money going into real estate.

Newegg takes bitcoins. I've also used it with Expedia while traveling and CheapoAir.com does it too.

Just because a lot of people break a particular law doesn't mean that it's not being regulated, and also copyright laws are enforced entirely separately from the FCC, because copyright violations depend on private causes of action from the holders in order to bring claims under the Lanham Act, which generally only involve civil penalties except in very limited cases, the FCC can directly enforce with the power of administrative law directly, not to mention that right now courts give administrative agencies almost unlimited deference in interpreting their own regulations.
This would be very malignant if they decide to butt in, definitely not something to hand-wave away.

I wouldn't be too quick to call whatever they're doing as "questionable" out front mostly because holding Renminbi is really a bit like holding balance on a gift card. It has limited transferrable value, is artificially inflated or deflated as the government see fits, with incredibly tight currency controls, particularly when it comes to conversion into hard foreign currency, to the point where it's literally true for most people with any sort of wealth that if they don't actively find a way to circumvent these controls and somehow get the money out of the country and into something with a bit actual value, then it's like they never made the money in the first place. The government tends to act arbitrarily and capriciously and there's pretty much 0 due process, and the government routinely targets people over petty personal issues between officials and the people, and sometimes entirely to assert the party's power, and most of the really rich people in the country at some point either end up making a run for it or end up in prison for the rest of their life over some flimsy sounding case with 0 public transparency. In many ways it's outwardly the perfect modern fascist state in that the government is able to assert its powers fully and convince most with few assets that dissent is entirely futile, corruption is routine and expected, and big brother is always watching, and of course the police department controls passports and foreign governments have played along like supplicants by enforcing almost uniformly stringent visa rules on its nationals. The government rules with a mix of nationalistic indoctrination since childhood (in elementary school, 'thought correctness' is literally a mandatory course) and selling a mix of paternal absolutism and open worship of materialism.
Under these circumstances, pretty much anyone with any sort of money is perpetually looking for ways to "launder" the money out, launder in quotes because usually the term denotes dirty money, but in China it wouldn't matter: dirty, clean, it's all monopoly money until you can move it out. It used to be that buying up real estate either domestic or foreign was a great way to shift money. Some bought foreign citizenship/immigration status (EB-5 visas in the US, nations like Nauru and Antigua sold citizenships outright, European nations always welcomed investments), but with increasing nationalism around the world, that avenue is increasingly limited, so crypto seems like a great way to actually have something of value that keeps its value more or less whether in Shanghai or Singapore. And a great reason why the government is trying to control it, of course.
I mean, I get it, there's a language barrier, cultural barrier, and sometimes what they do looks really sketchy, but I just feel like if any of us are stuck in the same oppressive regime with the same farcical methods to control even what we can do with our own money, hell, I'd go all in on some shitcoin if I can since it'll still be worth more outside of China than those red bills with Chairman Mao on it.

If by freeze you mean "hold it and force you to sue them to get it back", yeah.

That makes zero sense. That "same agenda" is the same agenda that all people in free societies share - of self-interest and following forces of the market. Giant corporations have shareholders and customers as well and those drive the profit principle. You are also free to not engage in transactions with them, and indeed if you don't agree with what they do, the only way you can really express it as a free person is to refrain from engaging it in the market instead of forcing a situation where they must do business with you. To somehow demand that actors in the marketplace must entertain a viewpoint, in spite of what it had decided based on market conditions, simply because that market condition is applicable to every actor in one field, now that's some seriously statist shit, yo.

Sure, but you can't buy just 1 gram for that price, since there's going to be a 5-10-whatever weight minimum and corresponding shipping. If you're happy buying bulk then that's cool, but people buying 50 doses of MDMA at once aren't really in the same market as people buying 1-2 doses at a time.

Eh, DNM always had inflated prices and generally inconsistent quality control. If someone has 0 or close to 0 sources for something, then it works out pretty well, but as a marketplace the value wasn't really always there.
Besides, everyone knew that where the real money was was in selling shitty fraud-related e-books anyway.
