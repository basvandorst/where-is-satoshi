And at least one of the developers can't stay off Reddit ;)
It is interesting to see all the competition cropping up; it can only do good for the Bitcoin and Poker worlds. Players have more venues to pick from, we all compete with each other to give you guys better promotions/rake/software, and everyone wins. It hasn't been like that since the Poker boom in early 2000.
Just be careful guys; some of these sites get into it not realizing the whole picture. Some don't secure their server and/or coin storage process well enough, some don't realize the overhead/work involved in managing the site, and others still may be quick to run away with player funds when anything goes south.
Everyone I refer to our site, I personally recommend that they withdraw their funds if they're not playing with it; unnecessarily trusting a third party with your coin longer than you have to is typically a bad idea. I user the same rule for exchanges (I skirted by only losing a very minimal amount when Bitfloor was hacked because of this). I'd hope everyone has the same sense at all the other sites they might play/use as well.
It's obvious that Bitcoin and online gaming are a perfect match. Players can buy and sell Bitcoin at their local exchange way faster than they ever could deposit/withdrawal traditionally; if it weren't for the variance in Bitcoin to local currency value, I think just about all of Poker would have moved over to it. Not all gamblers want to gamble while they gamble ;)
