Yes that what I figure. Plus I would be investing and helping in a new way we could live in the future, wich sounds interesting to me.

What I want to do though, is to put all in one place so that if I win big, then I win the jackpot, and if I loose everything, well, I loose everything. 
I dont have THAT MUCH to put in either,  Id be able to get 2.7 ETH coin  or 0.3 BTC Coin.  Ideally, Id like to just put the money, and let it sit there until next year Id come back and see whats going on with it.  no ? is that a bad idea ?

(dont mind the deleted message, it was the wrong message I deleted ) 
I didnt have any money extra to put in investment. And to boot, Iv just heard of Crypto currency about a month ago. ( Was planning to invest in marijuana before )  Now I just achieved my goal of having extra money to invest in something. 
Im making my decision now.  ( Thinking of putting it all in Ethereum or Bitcoin )

Cmon now, just because some people are trying to invest for the first time of their life do not mean they are fools. It only means they want to start gambling their money like anyone else.  With time comes experience in every single side of life.
