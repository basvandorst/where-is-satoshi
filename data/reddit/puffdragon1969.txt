I don’t really understand how Futures work. So any help is appreciated. From what I understand today at 4pm London time is when the first wave of CME future contracts close. At that time the price of bitcoin will determine who wins and loses, the guy going long or the guy going short. 
I’m assuming there is one standard “strike price” for all of the bitcoin futures expiring today. Is that true or is each contract and price decided by just the 2 people entering into it, in which each contract would have its own price which would determine who wins. 
Any help, I’m a newb!!!

For those of us rooting for bitcoin where do we need the price to be above by 4pm? 11am PST

Here’s the deal...if they don’t get it it’s because they have a block and aren’t willing to get it. In the eyes of the general population at 10k Bitcoin is worth half of what it was worth. The Fomo with the general public won’t kick in until we go past the old ath and get to around $25k. At that time friends &amp; family will start to ask you about it. Let them come to you. I finally decided to stop telling people about it and just let things unfold.  They are going to think your nuts and get angry if you keep going on and on about things.  There’s a reason why most people won’t ever be financially independent and that’s ok.

Set a buy limit on GDax that doesn’t expire until filled or cancelled by you. It buys for you automatically when price hits your given number. Easy to do.

Right on brother, or sister. I think Bitcoin represents Hope for many of us. I was inspired by your post.

I’ve been trying to read the Bible more so my rule is before I check the price I read the verse of the day. Needles to say I’ve learned a lot of bible verses as I read one about 30 times a day.

I have not. I’m waiting for more feedback to validate making the purchase. Someone said it was a scam on this thread and I’m curious as to why thy think so.

I’m new to mining. I’m open to either side. Why do you think it’s a scam.?

I’m thinking about making the purchase. Is roughly $8k for the minimum purchase of 5 units. 
I’ve been ripped off though by a purchase from a Chinese company before. That was completely unrelated to bitcoin. But I’m still a bit nervous. Looking for any feedback.

Ok wait... at what time do we eat the marshmallow.  BTC is inherently volatile.  I wish I would have eaten the marshmallow at 20k and then bought more marshmallows at 3.5k. I have hodl’d through without flinching and believe that the next big run up well beyond 20k is coming but at some point we must eat the damn marshmallow

Since I first got into Bitcoin I’ve always said this thing could go to zero and if so I’m prepared to ride it straight into the ground.  I didn’t invest in Bitcoin to get to first or second base. It was and still is a swing for the fences for me. I’ll either ride this thing beyond the moon or straight into the ground. Those are the only options for me personally.

8k is chump change for bitcoin. I’ll hodl until we get closer to 100k. I think it will go well beyond 100k but that is my sell point.
