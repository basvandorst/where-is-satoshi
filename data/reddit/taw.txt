You mean to somebody else's website? That sounds like an extremely horrible idea.

How do I do that? If I run it on old machine, it will probably just freeze for next month while trying to catch up on blockchain, then run out of diskspace before it finishes. Is `wallet.dat` not enough? That's supposed to be the only file needed to be backed up if I understand correctly.

Because if people can't run nodes directly, they need regular accounts at various account providers, and that can be traced.

If it's impossible for people to run own nodes, pretty much all advantages of bitcoin are already lost.

Archival nodes wouldn't help at all - with volume so many orders of magnitude higher even recent blocks would be completely unfeasible to process on a typical computer.
Once the only way to run a node is to have a server farm of custom hardware, it will also be easy for government to subpoena all node operators.

Bitcoin cannot scale to this volume of transactions for technical reasons.
And even if it could, the only real major use where bitcoin has big advantage over alternatives is for buying drugs and other illegal objects (digital objects like kiddie porn would probably work even better, but that's even more obscure than SilkRoad), and even that is too complicated for an average junkie, so even 1% of drug market for bitcoin is extremely optimistic.

Kim Dotcom believed that as well, didn't work for him either.
TPB might have survived *so far*, but for each 1 surviving TPB there were 99 failed file sharing websites, and TPB sacrifices a lot to survive.
And not one government made any attacks on TPB. A bunch of private companies did, and they were surprisingly successful, forcing a lot of ISPs to implement open-ended filtering systems which will see a lot more abuse in the future. If governments wanted to destroy TPB, it's really easy to do so by going after users and cutting their Internet access in some kind of 3 strikes law - bittorrent provides no safety to the users.

I'm sure they were making similar arguments at Altavista and Livejournal.
Network effects are real, but somehow alternatives keep popping up, and some of them end up winning.
Your stylized history of P2P is mostly wrong - there were hundreds of such systems, and pretty much all of them had open source clients, alternative servers in case official ones shut down etc. Many were also far better at finding really obscure stuff and bittorrent truly sucks at that.
For that matter Bittorrent should be easier to attack legally than some of the systems like Direct Connect - search is totally centralized, trackers were centralized until recently, IPs of downloaders are all in the open etc. - it's really amazing how TPB was able to tell copyright holders to go fuck themselves repeatedly over the years. It was a case of higher download speeds winning over everything else.
