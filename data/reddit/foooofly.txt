What's the solution? Another service, keep trying (when/how often?), other?

Been trying since Sunday. On their status page it says it's fixed. It's not. They're losing a lot of money from enthusiastic newbs.

I have a slight bit of paranoia about firehosing my ID onto a ton of services because I have a house purchase coming up next year. But that's my own risk/reward problem to deal with. Thanks for the input.

How long?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:02:36
Thanks, this was this week?

I was able to get email verification sorted out on Saturday night, FWIW. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:39:58
Yep, been at it since yesterday morning. Will keep trying periodically.
Was mostly posting for 'down for everyone or just me?' kinda thing.

No go, they claim my bank won't talk to them (Capital One). Thanks anyway.

(Noob). Would like to buy it with a credit card because I'm nervous about linking up with a checking account right now--will need to underwrite a mortgage in a few months and I need my checking to be spotless. Unfortunately I'm one of the poor idjits who came late and now can't get verified on coinbase.
Anyway, my point being, I would be spending money I had, just using a different payment method (and paying off the CC without carrying a balance). 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:06:56
Thanks. They're looking like the next on the list for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:53
That's already a thing.

And for verifying your ID.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:09:15
Check the whole post--iOS isn't working either.
(Taking photos of my DL and myself in good light with an iPhone 7.)
(For what it's worth the photos I tried to upload from my PC were also taken with my iPhone 7. Blurriness isn't an issue.)

I'm talking about the actual picture/document upload process. What do you mean you had to 'order an ID'?
