I've changed my alerts from $1000 increments to $5000, as I keep having to raise it so fast  each time I set it.

This seems to be asked everyday on here, either from Canadians or just anyone. This is not my site but it gives a great step by step. The part about using GDAX to save on withdrawal fees is at the bottom.

Here's a little tip to avoid the 4% transfer fee out of Coinbase. You go to gdax.com and log in using your Coinbase credentials. Then at the top right beside your name click on accounts. Click the down arrow and deposit all your coins from your Coinbase account into your GDAX account. Then after that click the up arrow, and choose to withdraw to LTC Address then enter your LTC wallet address for the wallet of your choice. You may need to supply a second piece of ID for verification if you can't get to the account step. Good luck!

With my approximate 4 weeks in the market here's my opinion on the matter. Not too sure? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:50:08
This exactly.

To buy or not to buy, that is the question?
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:30:08
Pretty ballsy move to put faith that it would stay high, or else they DGAF.

I use bread wallet on my iPhone.  Seems to do the trick until my Ledger Nano S comes in.

Stewart with the last laugh.

This guy is super fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:34:23
This guy is pretty good too!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:39:48
Does this only work for US citizens?

Pretty sure you can deposit on any of the trading platform for free with your pre-existing wallet with crypto currency in it. That would just be the down arrow portion and deposit from wallet.

But don't forget about it or you won't be revisiting any calls or messages!

Yeah man totally, bought today at $10,600CAD. Literally any time after I buy is your window for short-term dip gainz... 
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:22:41
Thank you, I'm a n00b (first purchase today) and I'm thankful for posts like these. These are posts and information that will help grow BTC and make it more appealing to everyday folk. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:29:48
From the impression I got from the commercial it was more so the entire focus of the episode. I'm going to guess they don't actually get to cash out though, due to some wacky zany obstacles!
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:19:32
Reading all the "I fucked up so bad" threads really motivated me to get in and as fast as I could. I only own fractions of a BTC but now I have my foot in the door and only account funding wait times are slowing me down. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:42:30
Christmas price strategy or a sign of higher BTC prices?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:35:57
QuadrigaCX if your Canadian. If you made a gain from when you bought the coin then yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:35:12
How did this all work out? Did they eventually work with you or did you have to find another bank?
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:45:04
I signed up and verified my account to make my first purchase within 20 minutes. It's just the limit that sucks, as well as the fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:28:44
Wait, so reverse mortgaging my house to buy this dip was not a solid move?!

Tesla is all about pushing the envelope, they should accept BTC.

You go to gdax.com and log in using your Coinbase credentials. Then at the top right beside your name click on accounts. Click the down arrow and deposit all your coins ( either BTC/LTC/ETH) from your Coinbase account into your GDAX account. Then after that click the up arrow, and choose to withdraw those transferred coins to a wallet of your choice. You may need to supply a second piece of ID for verification if you can't get to the account step. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:08:01
Thanks! I am trying to educate myself as best as I can, I'm anxiously waiting my larger account to be verified so I can really start to get some footing in the LTC market. 100 is the short term goal.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:54:36
This is a very good question that I am also wondering the answers to.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:06:18
From how I read it, it's any amount at all. You are taxed at your current income tax bracket, but only 50% of the gains are taxed (you made $500CAD from buy to sell, $250 of it is added to you personal income and taxed accordingly). I have not heard about doing anything with crypto from within a TFSA. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:20:06
Depends on the gains realized. Google your provincial + federal tax rate for your income. If cashing it all out right now bumps you up either cash only enough to keep you in your bracket, or load up on RRSP's but I'm no financial advisor so take this with a grain of salt.
