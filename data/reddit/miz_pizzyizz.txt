Wow this scammer is a total loser. Going after folks who get food to hungry people is lowest of the low. ffs, what a pos.
OP, thanks for all you do in this community and your local community. I learned about you through Will and send some coin when i can. No one should have to go hungry. Respect :)

My ma had an elderly friend from the UK who OFTEN used the phrase "touch wood." Only person i ever heard use the phrase so i looked it up and discovered it's used mainly in the UK, NZ, and OZ. Iirc "Knock on wood" is used almost exclusively in the U.S.

Since "coinbase" sent it to an email address they don't have, it looked more than a little sketchy. Love the "kind regards" since someone who frequently uses that phrase has recently ripped off a lot of crypto from "investors"
