So would everybody else in the entire world. You've just discovered the absolute bare minimum principle of trading.

True, that's one aspect that wasn't involved in the NYSE incident.

Why would he assume it's a joke? Simply ask for a source or information about it, but don't just assume because it's something you don't know about that it's a joke.

It was related to the speed and quick microtransactions of bots, bogging down the trades of real humans, which is exactly what's been happening to bitcoin today (or at least in the speculation of the OP image and the initial comment I replied to).

...they have crashed though. They caused a *massive* crash years ago that people still cannot understand or figure out why it happened.

edit 2: That was a segment from a Full episode, and it looks like that specific segment was taken down. The Full episode is here if anyone is interested:

For assuming it was a joke, sure. A higher post than his has the source for people seeking insight into the NYSE crash so no need to dip down any further anyways.

Here's a good podcast supported by NPR about it:

Shit, I thought it was just me that couldn't stream it at the moment. If you can find it somewhere else I would highly encourage it, Radio Lab show is beyond good, and the insight/interviews about the crash are amazing to listen to. I knew bots ran the stock exchange but wow, it's so much more deep and complex than I had originally imagined.
Sure, BitCoin bots aren't as sophisticated, but it's a really good lesson to learn and apply to BTC and the possibility of what's been happening today.
edit: I had just downloaded that episode no more than a month ago too :(
edit 2: It's a segment from THIS full episode. Guess they took down that separate segment. If you're still interested:

There was no system crash in the NYSE. The system was shutdown automatically *because* of how quick bots were selling. The algorithms were competing with each other and losing millions of dollars for "some reason", which kicked in the automatic shutdown of the system.
