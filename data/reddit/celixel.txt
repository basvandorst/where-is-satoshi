Same. I don't think the money is even worth the actual story that this guy is putting together in the first place. Get them in total grief and then gift them the private keys for Christmas, fucking genius. You should defo record their reactions

My god, you are a FUCKING GENIUS.

True. The blame's on you if you give a string of random words to someone who isn't even tech-savvy and expect them to understand what the potential value/loss means.

Oh just shut up and take my compliment!

Congratulations to the one of the slowest, most centralised cryptos in the world! If they don't sort this shit out, all of its rise will depend on noob investors who don't know much about crypto currency or blockchain.

To the person who said I was 'chemically dependent'. I wouldn't call 0.08g of ketamine dissolved in a cup of tea every 4 or 5 days a problem so in this case I have no issue being chemically dependent. As it stands I take around 0.06g every week now. It assists me in thinking more clearly about something other than the past, with enjoyable side-effects and no issues the next morning. I advise you to go and do some research.

Get little nano-cameras and stick them to the inside of the cards

You clearly can.

I do not understand why this comment has been downvoted.

You truly are a good person, by the way. I hope you grow old and live happily.

I'm so happy to see this. Microdosing ketamine has genuinely changed my life.
