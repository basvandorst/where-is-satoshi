Not surprising. He's the president of the USA, his wealth and power rests on the dollar (which he recently hinted about further devaluating).
First they ignore you, check.
Then they laugh at you, check.
Then they fight you, check.
Then you win.
A HUGE number of people just got introduced to the word "bitcoin", because the president (who's Donald Trump) tweeted about it.
We are living in interesting times for sure.

Nobody knows. Nobody can seriously say. Bitcoin is an unprecedented disruptive technology. The upside and potential is fucking HUGE tho.
The million figures are hard to imagine (just like $100 was once hard to imagine, or $1000 ... 10.000 was utopia, science fiction).
However, +100k should be very reachable within one (or two) halvings. One Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class A trades for $320,579 as this is written ... the day bitcoin comes close to this (if it ever does) there will be some serious economic earthquakes and continental driftings under way, globally.
History in the making, exciting times. We'll see how it plays out.
Welcome to the blockchain. Things are about to change.

With the heavy ath volume of the last three months it's more likely that one (or more) big institutional investers are loading up atm. Or some other entity like a central bank or a country even.
All theory, of course. But this heavy sustained volume is most likely not generated by single individual hodlers out of their bedrooms.

I'm kinda torn on bakkt. Yes, institutional money coming in might push price. Maybe a lot. Yes, aside of price the libertarian idea of bitcoin as freedom of choice, permissionless network of trust and so on needs bakkt and etfs like a second anus hole.
Will it, with enough money coming in, prohibit potential price manipulation that's possible on a small(er) crypto market? Will it open the doors for potential much larger forms of price manipulation, save enough bitcoins would be acquired?
Will bitcoin price only and/or mainly follow institutional money once enough comes in? And if so, is this a good or a bad thing?
What do you think?

It's true tho. 
You can put an few bucks into bitcoin as, say, a teenager and watch your bucks double, drop to half their value (lol) double again, triple, drop again ... if you keep reading and watching the action you'll learn about bull runs and bear markets, inflation and deflation, dca, different investment theories and strategies, the fed, the gold standard, libertarian market theories and so on ... simply by osmosis, by you sticking around, watching the price, reading news and having some skin in the game.

Valid arguments. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:24:54
While that's a libertarian sentiment that's understandable (and factually true) in many ways you probably don't really want Fiat to die asap or go down in a crash as this would likely mean civil unrest, blood in the streets, starving people, smashed supermarket windows, your parents, grandparents and loved ones losing all their life savings, their personal security and so on ...
Look what the internet did to the music industry. It killed the old, bloated, corrupt version of it but the music industry still exists. It ignored (first stage), denied (second stage), fought tooth and claw (third stage) and then had to adapt to the disruptive technology or perish (fourth stage). 
Now you have streaming, vevo, spotify etc. It will likely go down a similar road with bitcoin (and other cryptos) and the conventional fiat banking system. We are still at ignore stage, pretty much. They don't even deny yet for the most part. In the end, the old fiat banking model will die and adapt but bitcoin/crypto only seems a libertarian dream from our perspective imo.

mining costs - not relevant unless you're a miner
exchange fees - do research, use cheapest
scams - don't be stupid
frauds - don't be stupid
damaged or lost keys - don't be careless
whale manipulation - hodl
As long as supply is finite and demand constant or growing, price will go up in the long run. These
variables are in place right now. Hodl.

Jan/Feb 2019 is going to be interesting. If the mt.gox money meets the traditional low of bitcoin at the beginning of the year (chinese new year theory) there might be a unique opportunity to buy whole coins once more. 
Depends how price will develop for the rest of the year tho (possible bakkt push).
We'll see. 
@_date: 2019-07-08 07:56:53
You mean under.
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:06:40
@_date: 2018-09-15 10:57:59
You tell me. Say as a 18 yr old you found out about bitcoin in 2012. You put 100 bucks in. You didn't start to mine, seemed to complicated at the time (you regret this now). You bought them off an early exchange and paid, say, 0,25% fee to transfer it to your bitcoin core wallet. 
You found some site claiming to send you 2 bitcoins back for each bitcoin you send there - seemed fishy, didn't fall for it.
You found some supposed faucet service claiming to make you rich if you enter email and personal data - seemed fishy, didn't fall for it.
You saved your privat keys offline and backed them up in multiple versions because you read not your keys not your bitcoins.
Price fluctuated wildly over the years, some claim this is whale manipulation. But you never sold. 
Now it's 2018. Have you lost money? Or have you made money?
@_date: 2018-09-21 19:23:30
@_date: 2018-09-28 00:39:03
Daily transactions are slowly rising since July, for what it's worth. Nodes are up too. Google trends for bitcoin still low tho. 
Now bakkt will be interesting, will it push the price and how much. I think about 1-3k, then a possible dump in jan/feb 2019.
We'll see.
@_date: 2018-09-17 04:28:34

@_date: 2018-09-02 19:17:12
Price won't increase infinitely of course, because nothing does. But 6-8k is nothing. Also 20k is nothing in the long run. There is _huge_ room for growth. 
Think the difference 2013 to today (5 yrs). Then today to 2023.
Also do not focuse on price alone. don't invest more that you can afford to lose and all that, of course. 
Bitcoin is a disruptive unprecedented technology. 
The future is going to be very exciting, one way or another.

@_date: 2018-09-08 21:04:00
now _that's_ some realtalk.
@_date: 2018-09-12 17:15:15
I think so too. 
There may be possible black swan events for price (say someone throwing lare quantities of 100.000s bitcoins on the market, like this alleged dark web wallet moving or proof coming out of theter being fishy) and possible black swan events for bitcoin as a technology (at this point probably only the cryptographic algorithm being broken or something of this nature).
But it's objectively clear that interest and demand in bitcoin is growing constantly and nowhere _near_ two years ago. Look at the number of listening nodes, look at the daily transactions, look even at the numbers of this subreddit lol ... then we have lightning, scaling debate done, next halving to come, bakkt, etf discussions, millenials coming into positions to earn, save and invest ...
As long as supply is finite and demand constant or growing, price will go up in the long run. How soon or how fast or how high nobody can seriously say. 
But as it is now, these variables are in place. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 10:42:26
So it goes.
@_date: 2018-09-11 16:36:14
Actually this price predictions might very well be true lol ... bakkt could push the price at the end of the year tho. Emphasis on _could_.
@_date: 2018-09-19 18:12:32
just hodl.
@_date: 2018-09-02 15:04:20
Because supply is finite and demand constant to growing. As long as those variables keep in place, price will go up.
@_date: 2018-09-21 23:33:03
True test will be jan/feb 2019 when chinese new year theory meets potential mt.gox money or fud thereafter. If that can't break 6000 people might feel safe.
And maybe that's _just_ when it will tank -- to spring up again with one of these incredible heartbeat bounces we had two days ago. That's the beauty of bitcoin. Whenever you think you've figured something out for sure it jumps in a fuck-you-direction.

Propz for the effort and the willingness to learn.
@_date: 2018-09-18 11:52:55

I too know people like this. No online banking, not even a cell phone (very few and very 'excentric' ones, but still). On the other hand, how many grandmas are now sending pictures of their grandchildren around via whatsapp?
And millenials and the generation after (gen Z) is just native with this shit. It has been around since they were born. 
So who knows. In a couple of generations kids might laugh at the idea of an common "bank" where you pay to have your money stored which loses value all the time and can be taken away from you by the government anytime ... "That's nuts" they gonna say. "Why did you do it?"
"Well", you'll say, "There really was no alternative. Until ..."

@_date: 2018-09-16 16:59:01
Save any unexpected events like 100.000s coins being thrown on the market I think anticipation and or effect of bakkt might push the price another 1-2k at the end of the year until it flattens again to 6-7kish territory, maybe even lower in early 2019 (chinese new year theory).
At the same time I feel a lot of people are sitting on the fence waiting if price will ever drop to 3-5k territory again so that they can jump in buying whole coins once more.
Then sometime between 2019-2021 in anticipation or effect of the halving the next bull run will go off in the stratosphere of around 100k per coin, plus minus.
This profound ta is based on a feeling in my balls which I will never eat on live television, no matter the price of bitcoin, or bircoin.

Why downvotes, it's true. Bitcoin was conceived as a currency, not as a speculative asset.
That it's treated as a speculative asset right now is due to the fact that it's still fcking YOUNG and nobody knows in which direction this technology will go. 
Only it appears clear for all with eyes to see and a mind to think that it's impact gonna be HUGE in some way or another. 
Now you could say blockchain not bitcoin and even this would be a valid argument. But in terms of decentralisation there is STILL no other alt even remotly close to bitcoin.
And while bitcoin (and certain alts) are fascinating for a multitude of reasons BESIDES decentralisation (deflationary, pseudonymous, permissionless, open source, open borders, micro-payments-possible ... and on and on), the decentralisation is what establishes trust in the network, not in people or governments or institutions.
For people always can be corrupted through greed and fear, but the technology of the network as a tool can't be corrupted as such, only through people.
As long as nobody owns it, it will be free.

Depends on your time perspective. You are looking at this from the ath. Zoom out AT LEAST two years: nodes up, daily transactions up, price exploded, fork and scaling debate done (for now), dominance up, lightning ... nothing but upsides.
Zoom out five years: INSANE upsides.

Propz for your balls for going all in. That's a bold move. See, nobody knows. In five years (if you hodl) you might laugh at the newbs coming on saying 'this bear market at 45k is killing me, will it ever go back to +100k?? was it the same back THEN?"
On the other hand, nobody knows. Bitcoin is still completely wild west. We are out at the frontiers of an unprecedented technology. 
On the other hand, without people believing in the vision + tech and (also) putting their money in, price would still be around 3$ or it would have died off long ago.
So propz.

Also some sort of 2fA for sending bitcoin should be integrated with wallet use for wider audiences. So that if you are being stupid and someone gets your seed/private key, he can't move any bitcoin without an extra password ore some TAN-like code or something.

If you consciously hodl'd through the dark winter of bitcoin from 2013-2016 you deserve every penny of your wealth, imo.
Let alone if you found out about it, saw the value, got in and bought + hodl'd from 2011 (!) onwards.

Trying to time the market seems futile to me. If you have a lot of money in it's probably inevitable (since we're all human). But time in the market beats timing the market, +100000000 with bitcoin in the last 9 years.
So put in perspective AT LEAST a two year time period and focus on more telling things (signal over noise): nodes up, daily transactions up, fork and great scaling debate done (for now), alts going down, bitcoin dominance going up, next halving to come ...
YES if you went all in or with a lot of money in at the ath that's tough as blood right now. But zoom out and try to catch the big picture. 
Nothing but upsides compared to two years ago. INSANE upsides compared to five years ago.

Interesting question, but there was no bull run in 2015(?) Unless you consider the v e r y   v e r y  slow recovering of the price as the beginning of the bull run in 2017?

So it begins. Negative rates for private depositors. Pretty soon this is going to be standard, don't you think? The way things are going this will *have* to be standard sooner or later.
2008 started a new economical era, only very few people seem aware of it. The old system got exposed for it's insane fragility and almost collapsed as the house of cards it is. 
At the same time, the alternative to the old system was born. That's why we are here today, in this subreddit. Because we believe in this alternative.

@_date: 2019-11-29 18:59:42
Those are great news.
Sure, keeping bitcoin at a bank kind of defeats the purpose for us in this sub here, but that's a major step towards mainstream adoption.
All the older people who can't or won't learn about downloading a wallet, getting an account at some exchange etc., they all can buy now. Also, if this shit gets standard, there won't be any hassle no longer with frozen accounts or concerned questions because of buying bitcoin and so on. And since Germany is one of the worlds leading economies, other countries will be motivated to follow course.
Clever German banks, they choose to embrace instead of fighting the inevitable.
Also complements the upcoming halving just in time. The future is going to *very* interesting, one way or the other.

Judging by the activity in the bitcoin subs we are in capitulation phase for sure. Meanwhile, price keeps slowly and steadily climbing since december.
If bitcoin does what we believe it'll do, the people accumulating and dca'ing right now will be very happy about 1,5 years from now.
We'll see.

2017 was still important tho. For my money, going from 1k-10k was much more unbelievable than anything else. After that, literally everything is possible wrt to price. 2017 put that on the map.

While price hovers around 4k relatively stable it seems, judging the activity in the bitcoin subs, that we've finally reached capitulation phase for everybody who's not a true believer in bitcoin.
All the people who fomod in at the last hype cycle are long gone, having (most likely) sold at a loss. Even the trolls don't come around anymore, calling everyone a bag holder and making snarky remarks. Where have they gone?
Meanwhile the next halving dawns on the horizon. First litecoin, we'll see the impact that'll have. Actually we see it already. Then finally next year, the big B.
Only silent clever hodlers around now, watching lightning grow and prosper, dca'ing, knowing now is the bullshit free time to accumulate.
We are living in exciting times wrt bitcoin, even if it doesn't look like it if you focus on price only.

If it's one of your investment properties and your financial safety does not depend on it this is actually a (bold but) great move to push adoption and awareness.
@_date: 2019-11-13 19:16:25
We can guess that this in some form will probably be the future of "banks": Custodial services that hold insured bitcoin and fiat (as long as fiat exists) together or pegged together to hedge inflation or whatever.
This of course defeats the purpose of bitcoin and his highly dubious to begin with (nacho keys), but since many people probably won't be willing or able to go through the learning process of getting their own wallet and securing their own keys, there's probably going to be a rather large target audience for this kind of thing if mass adoption occurs in any form.
At least as a transitory period until buying and storing bitcoin becomes so easy that every grandma is able to do it on their phone with literally one click.

If bitcoin keeps doing what it has been doing the last 10 years it will catapult to 10-15 x the last ath, then crush down about 80%.
This would generate very high numbers this time.
Historically the bull run to the next ath started about six months after the halving.
We'll see how it plays out.

Tho holding bitcoin at a fucking bank (of all places) kind of defeats the purpose and is highly dubious (nacho keys), it probably would be a huge step toward adoption at this point.
In the not to far future "banks" might be forced to hold (only?some?) bitcoin if they even want to keep existing.

I think a lot of people are waiting and watching if the price ever drops to 2-3k territory again to then jump in and buy whole coins once more. I don't see any major hodl-exodus, even if the price should drop. 
Paradoxically that might be, among other things, what prevents the price from dropping below 6k ... a huge number of people waiting and ready to buy.

It's great news.
Keeping bitcoin at a bank defeats the purpose for us in this sub here, but that's a major step towards mainstream adoption.
All the older people who can't or won't learn about downloading a wallet, getting an account at some exchange etc., they all can buy now. Also, if this shit gets standard, there won't be any hassle no longer with frozen accounts or concerned questions because of buying bitcoin and so on. And since Germany is one of the worlds leading economies, other countries will be motivated to follow course.
They choose to embrace instead of fighting the inevitable.
Also complements the upcoming halving just in time. The future is going to very interesting, one way or the other.

Well, ironically the bank could take your 100k away pretty fast, you only do not realize it until it happens. 
If you are not trolling and your concern is legit, you don't have to put 100% of your money into bitcoin and go hail mary all in. Why not dca a small percentage of your saving money on a wallet of your choice. Keep reading and learn slowly and steadily how this works, don't panic mode like dark net evil bots and hackers can take my bitcoin any second!!! 
That's not how this shit works. Keep your private keys private aka own them yourself, don't throw money at shady shit and you'll be fine.

@_date: 2018-10-19 23:09:52
While this might even be rational reasoning you, like many people, appear to ignore the halvings to come. 
Even with interest in bitcoin simply staying constant the increasing scarcity will pump the price ... that alone should be enough but it's a self feeding circle: institutional money coming in (bakkt), people discovering bitcoin as a hedge against inflation even with tiny amounts of money, borderless, permissionless, not owned by any single entity ... while _simultaneously_ getting scarcer all the time.
There is no crisis in economy needed and the shift in public awareness is only a matter of time, save any black swan events for the network itself.
Just buy, hold and wait. No 5 billion ico ads needed. Sooner or later people might not only talk about bitcoin at birthday parties, they'll pay the whole damn party with bitcoin.

In this version of the future human beings would still be in control of the a.i. ... so since robots don't work to generate profit for themselves, you could theoretically make them work for humans and use the generated profit for ubi (which would be needed since there wouldn't be enough jobs anymore that required human beings).
And since bitcoin is the harder money (harder vs. softer money theory, see Saifedan Ammous), everything would happen on the blockchain.

Numbers don't lie. It's also better for your psychological health. 
It teaches you patience, endurance and discipline. If you decide to dca regularly as long as the fundamentals of bitcoin are in place (new blocks every ten minutes, fixed cap of 21 million ...) you don't have to (overly) worry about price.
If you can manage to do this you'll stay clear of fomo urges and panic sells. You'll have less sleepless nights and less manic days.

I love bitcoin and believe it's going to change the world in ways we can't even imagine yet but personally I think the  safe-haven-theory is to early for the mass of people. It's still way to fringe and percieved as weird internet shit by most people.
If a major recession would be in full force now, bitcoin price is likely to tank. Maybe not as bad as stocks and bonds, but still.
On or two halvings in the future things might look way different tho. 
It's all speculation at this point. We'll see.

Nobody can tell. It would be the first recession since the invention of bitcoin. Some believe in the save-haven-theory, that like gold people will go to bitcoin to preserve their wealth. People who are hodlers already certainly will do this, keeping the larger picture in mind.
But bitcoin is still to fringe for the masses and percieved as weird internet shit. If the stock and bond markets are tanking, bitcoin price is likely to tank too at this point imo. Maybe not as bad, but as as people need to cash out on their assets to pay for rent, food and gas, there will be little room to throw money at something that's percieved as a highly speculative investment (by the genral public, that is) like bitcoin.
Two or three halvings in the future tho this might look completely different.

The more you look into the nature of (fiat)money, the history of it, the current state of it; the absurder (and scarier) it gets.


This is certainly true. You don't notice your monetary system as long as it's "working".
@_date: 2019-10-01 19:48:37
First of all, though many indicators point towards a coming recession (inverted yield curves, qe ...) nobody can say for sure if and when this will happen.
Secondly, bitcoin was created as an alternative to fiat and conventional banking and you are asking these question in a bitcoin forum. Still, going "all in" on bitcoin right now because you fear a coming recession is a very *very* risky move that nobody can seriously recommend, not even here. 
Use your own caution. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dca'ing and diversifying, even if you love bitcoin like many of us.

@_date: 2019-10-06 09:38:28
Solid points, I think along these lines too.
1. 
2. No expert on this, but I think you are right, p2p music sharing is dead because of streaming, spotify and the like. The industry adapted. Why pull down shit inconveniently on your hard drive if you have everything you want in the world on your phone via streaming? For effectively outlawing bitcoin the whole world (or large parts thereof) would have to work in synchronicity, which seems very unlikely. I rather see certain countries or governments trying to tax it to death at the fiat on- and off-ramps.
3. Solid points, but I think you have to factor greed into this. Once your brother in law, neighbour, nephew, colleague from accounting etc. suddenly quits his job and starts to world travel or buys a nice condo while you are sitting at your hated 9 to 5 and you'll hear the magic word ('bitcoin') popping up more and more around real people in your immediate environment, people on a large scale will have a powerful urge to look into this shit. Greed will take over apathy. Add to this more and more easier ways to exchange fiat to bitcoin on your phone (cashapp etc.) and at some point it will snowball.

Solid points. 
One could argue that these excesses are ath global debt, quantitative easing and companies buying back their own stock in a highly inflated market bubble. And probably other shit I can't think of right now.
Agree tho that no single trigger has appeared yet to speak of like in say 2007/2008.

Those tipping bots are the shit imo. I envision a future where they are easy to use and applicable on all (social) media through the net; twitter, fb, youtube, tumblr, what have you.
That in one stroke would kill the need for steemit (lol) and push major adoption because say you barely know bitcoin, have heard about it on the media but don't give a fuck. Now you write a funny youtube comment or whatever and forget about it. Suddenly you get a notification, congrats, ride_the_LN has tipped you 10.000 sats.
You go, what is this and do a quick research (since getting flashy free shit triggers the greed factor in human psychology) and boom you are one step further on the learning curve what bitcoin is, lightning etc. You realize holy fuck, this is or could be REAL MONEY.
I can see a future where sats are being moved easily, immediately and with no boundaries whatsoever all throughout the net via lightning every second. Once that is in place, it really will be 'the currency of the net'.

We don't. Nobody does.
We have ten years of history to look back to tho: Bull run to ath, crash to about 80% from ath, bear period, halving, bull period, run to new ath 10-15x the previous one, crash to about 80% from new ath, bear period, halving ... rinse and repeat.
Past performance is no guarantee for the future tho. Bitcoin is an unprecedented disruptive technology. Literally anything can happen.

Could very well be. If the logarithmic chart (100k ath) and bitcoins history (- 80/85% from ath) remain true it should rather be a bottom between 15k-20k somewhere.

Most people don't give a shit how the economy works (you don't notice your monetary system until it stops working) live paycheck to paycheck, don't want or can't learn about inflation, the fed, the gold standard etc.
Also, the dollar has been around since before you were born, bitcoin is still *young as fuck* and before bitcoin there really was no alternative to fiat.

This correlates nicely with the famous "Lambo Effect" in bitcoin:
The Lambo Effect is a concept that the future expectancy of existance of some perishable thing like a Lambo for the hodler is proportional to the amount of time spent hodling, so that every additional period of hodling implies a higher probability of Lambo.

We for sure seem to be entering very strange times. 
Negative interests on credits and zero to negative interest on savings further incentivizes the debt spiral. Fiat is being printed endlessly out of thin air by the centralized banking system to support this house of cards, until it crashes, as it ultimately must (?) When will the crash come? How bad will it get?
Meanwhile there is bitcoin. For the first time in human history there is an alternative to the financial system being forced on to you since you were born. You can take your financial sovereignity in your own hands, you can read and learn about it, face the risks, enter uncharted territory. How many will do this? How many will be forced to do this by a changing fiat economy in one way or another?
Interesting times ahead.
@_date: 2019-02-22 20:44:39

Don't try to convince anyone. Either they get it and get in on it by themselves, or they won't.
Also, don't talk about bitcoin ~~too much~~ at all. Should it do what most of us believe it will, you might be in for some nasty surprises if everybody knows you as "the bitcoin guy" who preached about.

Haven't read the whitepaper but isn't the plan something like you and I hang out on fb, you're like send me 50 bucks bro, I go sure bro and with one click via messenger or whatever it arrives in your wallet? Instantly or at least much faster than paypal?
If so, that would be a lot easier than using paypal.

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. If 10% is more than you can afford, don't invest it.
Nobody knows where this is going. Bitcoin is an unprecedented disruptive technology. We can look at other unprecedented disruptive technologies like the internet and make educated guesses. Still, nobody knows.
Your 10% could be gone one day. Or they could make you rich one day.

Banks will be forced to hold bitcoin if they don't want to go out of business. See Germany, where this is starting at this moment.
There will always be people who will be unwilling/unable to get a a wallet themselves, secure a private key etc. Also fiat likely will keep existing for the foreseeable future in some form or other.
However, we have a viable option now to fractional reserve fiat banking, which didn't exist before bitcoin. Thus, we've entered a new economic paradigm, something which few people seem aware of yet, globally speaking.
Also disagree that 'before 2018 it looked like Bitcoin was going to take over the world in only a few years'. Too narrow a time frame. Maybe during the bull run of 2017, but during the long winter of 2013-2016 nothing looked like taking over the world. It looked more like the opposite, at least wrt price.

Sadly he doesn't get bitcoin. You can just tell he hasn't read and learnt enough about what bitcoin is to really grasp it's implications.
It's the case with many smart people and so called experts of the former (economic) paradigms. Sometimes I feel like, motherfucker, if you just put in an honest unbiased effort, read a couple of books and and browsed fucking *this subreddit* for a year, you would know more of what you are talking about. But then, everybody has to live and learn at his own pace.

Everybody has at least heard about bitcoin by now. Almost nobody understands and few are really interested. The understanding part is forgivable, you have to invest a considerable amount of time to read and learn about the history of money among many things (economics, game theory, tech ...) to appreciate that bitcoin is an unprecedented technology, completely unique in the history of mankind.
The hardest form of money ever created.

It's a good idea if you are a libertarian who loves the idea of the freedom that bitcoin provides. It's also a good idea as long as price is going up.
If the price crashes, you might lose money that you would have needed in case of an emergency.
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider dca'ing, diversifying in different assets and keeping some cash reserves for emergencies.

Cant't really compare. As for average roi the last 10 years, bitcoin beat everything.
But bitcoin is an unprecedented disruptive technology that started a new economic era. Only few people are aware of it yet, globally speaking. For the first time since the abolishment of the gold standard, there is a viable alternative now to fractional reserve fiat banking. And also a borderless permissionless new asset class that's open to everybody and anybody at any time, all you need is a phone. Not saying stocks are done now (lol), but that (potentially) includes a much larger target audience than the stock market.

There have been frequent reports of people getting their bank accounts frozen when they bought bitcoin. It depends on the country you live in and your bank though. Others have no problem.
With banks increasingly (being forced or choosing to) adopting bitcoin in the near future (see Germany) hopefully this is going to be a thing of the past soon.
If you want to avoid the hassle right now it's probably a smart move to get a cheap or ideally free second bank account and handle all your bitcoin stuff from there.

Nobody can honestly say. Depends on the financial crisis too, when it happens, where etc.

You never have to go all in, you never have to go all out. Walk the middle way, motherfucker, as ancient wisdom tells us.
It all depends on your circumstances. If you are a hardcore libertarian fed hating bitcoin maximalist then you never have to trade back to fiat again and can hope for maximum adoption.
If you have bills to pay, mortage, car, student loan, alimony etc. ... then a bull run could help you out of your debt by changing to fiat.
Either way, best way to respond to a bull run is to lean back in your chair, light a cohiba and smile.

Don't preach. 
Either they get it on their own, or they won't. At worst, if bitcoin does what we believe it will, you'll be remembered as The Bitcoin Guy by some *close friend* that doesn't turn out to be that much of a *friend* but still close enough to remember your preaching.
Hyperinflation hasn't happened in the west in our lifetime. It's hard for people to imagine that the dollar might go down. The dollar is everything - your rent, your debt, your job, food for your family, world economy. Obscure and probably shady "internet money" should save us all? Worse, nobody understands this shit. They hacked my email once so I had to get a new one with the pw 12345asdf, now I gotta shoot my holy dollars into this unknown internet void? You gotta be crazy!!
Still, I hope *if* the bitcoin revolution comes to every home, that it will be as silent and bloodless as possible. Like most people I don't want to see family poor, confused friends without money, smashed supermarket windows, riots in the streets ... all that.
I'd help out anybody I can with everything I have to avoid that.

Who knows. Let's wait through early 2019 (chinese new year theory) to see how price will develop.
If it stays stable, that would actually be equally awesome. If it goes up, nuff said. If it goes down, opportunity to buy.
Nothing but upside :)
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:21:59
One of the best so far lol
@_date: 2018-11-05 20:09:48
It's undeniable that daily transactions are increasing while price remains stable, whatever that means.
Whether that's really evidence of otc transactions, bakkt (?), a bull run to come or whatever, nobody can really say.
It can only be a good sign tho, imo. The opposite (less and less transactions) wouldn't be so good.

In the end, nobody knows. All about bitcoin is uncharted territory. It's an unprecedented disruptive technology.
We can look back at 10 years of history tho and see the following pattern: about 6 months after a halving price peaks at 10-15x the last ath, then drops about 80% during a period of "bear market" (quotes because whether that's a bear or not depends on your perspective, market entry etc.). 
Past performance does not predict the future. Should this pattern hold tho, we'd reach very high numbers around 2020-2021 this time.

You always have to factor in fomo, fud, hype, sentiment, bullshit ... to get an objective (as much as that's possible) outlook on bitcoins development zoom out _at least_ two years, focus on tech (lightning, segwit), number of nodes, daily transactions etc ... then the old _don't invest more than you can afford to lose_ and you'll stay calm and collect through hype cycles and the up and down of price fluctuation.

That's an important point I think: You gotta be young enough to _get_ the value and usability of Bitcoin in technical/digital terms yet you gotta be old enough to have income/money to invest and the ability to think longterm which must place the broad average of hodlers and true bitcoin believers in the age range of say about 27-45 or so. 
It took the internet roughly 15-20 years to reach the average Grandma who is now sending pics of their grandchildren via whatsapp. Bitcoin is now entering it's 10th year of existence. 
While getting scarcer all the time and while the kids of today, for whom throwing 'digital coins' around is as native as texting will enter the workforce and earn money to save and invest.
The coming years will stay exciting, one way or the other.
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:50:24

Depends on what you mean by fail wrt Bitcoin.
Price crashes? That happens regularly.
Price crashes very much? That happens regularly.
Not getting adopted as international currency? Already is.
Not getting adopted as international currency by every grandmother to buy their groceries with? Arguably, yes that would be a fail. Bitcoin would still exist tho, and grow in tech an price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time.
Large number of coins being thrown on the market by whoever? Price would crash, Bitcon would still exist and grow in tech and price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time.
Another alt takes over wrt price/adoption? Arguably, yes that would be a fail. Still no other alt in sight at this point wrt decentralization, network effect, lindy effect and fixed market supply that could match Bitcoins now +10 year history. Also, Bitcon would still exist and grow in tech and price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time.
Another alt comes out of the left field with improved tech (faster transactions or whatever) rising to wide adoption? Bitcoin would still exist exist and grow in tech and price (most likely) while getting scarcer all the time - and whatever tech improvements make this (or any alt) more optimal than Bitcoin can (most likely) be implemented with 2nd or 3rd layer tech into Bitcoin.
A Black Swan event kills the network, say the cryptographic algorithm being broken/cracked, quantum computing etc.? Yes, this would be a fail, actually the only real fail that could be considered as such imo. Didn't happen as of yet tho. Should it happen, we'll see what happens.

Bitcoin is an emerging technology in an emerging market. Thus the volatility. Once it's stable for a long time (think decades) it will be used as a currency more regularly and globally than now. 
But some water gonna run down the river until then.

Interesting reasoning lol
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:29:43
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:42:22
That might be a real sentiment in the not too far future.
@_date: 2019-01-12 10:26:11
Store of value and transfer of value is already in place. Money too, tho it's true that this is hampered through volatility atm. If you believe in the tech, see the longterm vision and _don't invest more than you can afford to lose_, daily price action aka volatility won't faze you.
You don't have to sell house, car, wife and life to go hail mary all in on bitcoin, by the way. If you are serious, why not invest some fuck you money/couple of bucks that you can afford and watch how it evolves while you keep reading and informing yourself about Bitcoin?

@_date: 2019-09-03 08:32:17
100k ... nothing will have to crumble for that, imo. One Berkshire Hathaway stock a trades for 300k at the moment.
The day bitcoin will come close and/or passes that we will write true history in my book. 
It'll simply mean that bitcoin will be as established as a store of value and that people will withdraw money from other assets and put it into bitcoin.
With a one million bitcoin things might look different, but then who knows. Plenty other assets will exist just like now. That's simply the nature of the market. If bitcoin "succeeds" aka global mainstream adoption happens, it might become a universal unit of account to measure all other assets against it.
At this point, almost everybody will have and work with bitcoin in some form, just like almost everybody has a phone in 2019 and uses the internet in some form. It will simply be a part of daily life, so integrated and easy to use that you don't even think about it anymore and your grandparents are using it by pressing one big button.
@_date: 2019-09-07 08:38:28
People thought like this even in 2011/2012. 
Meanwhile if they would educate themselves they would learn that getting in now would still make them early adopters.

Possible, but I have a hard time believing that. Most people probably have *heard* about bitcoin now in some form due to news coverage. 
But people actually *understanding* bitcoin enough to buy and hold some, that's gotta be around 1-2% globally, if that.

Agree. Also when not focusing on the present day/price too much but putting in context at least a two year window: nodes up, transactions up, general awareness up, development up (lightning, segwit), daily transactions up, hashrate up, great scaling debate and fork done (at least for now), next halving to come ...
Everything in the green. YES if you went with too much or all in at ath that's still tough as nails, but you gotta put all this in long term perspective. 
Bitcoin is here to stay, save some unforseeable black swan event.

"The reason "standard wallets" are deterministic wallets with seeds is that early Bitcoin users experienced a lot of Bitcoin loss through negligence - failure to backup their keys properly. Bitcoin loss through key theft was (still is) virtually non-existent"
Thx for the info, didn't know that.

True, but factoring in the halvings price will go up even if demand stays the same. And the way it looks now, the trend is the opposite. Demand is growing.

That way, keep your seed and your transaction pw seperat. Someone needs to get both to be able to do something.

Bitcoin is the only decentralized coin without a governing board/company/person ... it is a protocol and a network of trust that can't be changed, inflated or forked without _voluntary consensus of the majority of users_ (miners, nodes, market, hodlers ...) 
That's what makes bitcoin unique in the world today, unique in the history of money, unique in the history of mankind and unique among all other cryptos.
As long as no other alt comes along to fulfill these criteria, bitcoin will reign. As it has done in the past 9 years without a single day off.

By bitcoin having no ceo.


Only one of them is bitcoin, no matter how many forks.


Possible that there is manipulation going on, since it's a very small market. Nobody knows tho how much of this is _really_ going on and how much is conspiracy. The market is small because the majority of coins are hodl'd, hence the daily price action is misleading. 


Don't leave your coins on exchanges.




Just hodl the real bitcoin.


Don't leave your coins on exchanges.


The current bitcoin market is small compared to worldwide economy. It will (most likely) not stay like that in the future. Nobody controls bitcoin, nobody decides the direction. Everybody is free to fork. There is only one bitcoin. Just buy and hodl this one and you'll be fine.

See, this is the kind of shit that gets me excited when I witness it. Sure the price is down like hell and the market is bleeding but if you zoom out for once from the daily price action and focus on wonderful tech like this simple (?) little bot, the future appears mindblowing.
Once something like this hits say twitter in a fun, easygoing, usable and practical way, shit is going to be OVER: lightning will explode, everyone will read up how to set up a node, people will be tipping people left and right, bitcoin will be in WIDE WIDE mainstream focus through simple usability ...
It's stuff like this that makes bitcoin what it is: a technology that is going to change the world as we know it.

Also the reddit bot works as a wallet (sort of?). If someone tips you, the sats are stored on your reddit account/bot ... you can tip them further to other people or withdraw if you have a lightning wallet or node set up (if I understand it correctly).

We are approx. one year away from the next halving. Bitcoins historical pattern from the last 10 years predicts that we are in the beginning of a bull phase now, that will peak approx. 12 months after the halving at 10-15x the previous ath.
This would create very high numbers this time.
Past performance does not guarantee the future tho. Use your own caution. Don't invest more than you can afford. Consider dca'ing.
Good luck!

I think, despite the 'dark times' right now with being 80% down from the last ath, 2017 was one of the most important years in bitcoins history. 
It brought unprecedented mainstream attention, showed long time hodlers that there was indeed justified hope after the apocalyptic gox meltdown and the dark winter of 2013-2016. 
If you hodled through that, you'll hodl through everything.

You don't think about your monetary system as long as it "works".
The dollar has been around since before our birth. Most people don't give a shit about inflation, economics etc. as long as the current lifestyle consisting of entertainment, tech and bling is affordable out of debt. Everybody is doing it.
Bitcoin (the tech) is hard to understand for the average person, just like the internet (the tech) is. Why bitcoin works or why it has value is even harder to understand since it spreads over multiple fields; game theory, economics, tech, code ... etc.
Be glad. We are still early, very very early. We are witnessing history in the making. We truly are.

Possible, but then without specifics, it's impossible to argue or judge your reasoning. Like his main argument in this talk is against central banking and the negative consequences thereof.
You could argue that his speech is aimed ("cherry picked") in this direction, which could be true. Do you think he is missing an objective overview because of his personal involvment with crypto/bitcoin? So what inferences or leaps of logic does he specifically make? Is central banking always bad? If yes, why? If no, why not? Are there positive aspects about the current system? If yes, which? If no, why not? Is the system inherently flawed like he (AA) argues? If yes, do you share his reasoning? If no, what is he missing?

Many people have learnt this lesson exactly this hard way and many will in the future.
You can avoid all this shit if you simply don't trip if the price flashes either upwards or downwards. It's hard and tripping is human, so we all do it. 
But if you can keep your head (when all about you are losing theirs), learn from history, stay calm and don't panic, you'll win in the long run.
Read up upon the fundamentals of bitcoin, learn, make your own conscious decisions and opinions, try to understand.  Consider dca'ing, don't invest more than you can afford, don't let greed take over, stay calm, don't fomo in or out no matter the price. 
Good luck.

People focus on the 80% loss because historically, that has been bitcoins price cycle (save the +90%  drop in 2011) ... bottoming out at around 80% of the previous ath, then rising back up to unseen heights.
But sure, it COULD go lower. Nothing is set in stone with bitcoin. It could also skyrocket to +800% tomorrow.

True, but it ain't that easy. The rich text message was sent trough the server while you had your regular wallet open and tried to send btc (if I understand it correctly) - it popped up while using your wallet.
That method is nasty. Sure, it _should_ make you skeptical. Sure, you _should_ see the weird source of the download. Sure, you _should_ always verify.
Still, nasty shit. I can see people/noobs falling for this.

Bakkt may come in January and influence shit, or it won't. Proof of Keys will come in January and influence shit, or it won't. Price will go up, price will go down. McAfee will glance at his wiener. The death of bitcoin will be declared on reddit and elswhere. People will try to shill people. Other people will keep working on amazing shit for the network.
Price will flow up and down, like a river, going it's way. Like one of these ancient Chinese paintings. People with yellow hats sitting next to it, unfazed by the tide.

I woke up today and felt like rolling back the blockchain. Sadly, this isn't possible with bitcoin. I immediately dumped everything and jumped onto some other coins.
@_date: 2018-12-21 12:09:00
The way to use bitcoin is to acquire it and then watch balance and charts with glazed over eyes while whispering _precious_ until you pass out, every day.

Couple of days til Proof of Keys, what do you think will happen? I think a mini pump because it's the first. If it gets established as a regular Bitcoin Independence Day and grows I can see amazing things for the network, hodlers and price coming out of it.
@_date: 2019-05-12 09:03:59
Dafuq, people tipped you with bitcoin in *2011*?? Those must have been hardcore nerds/early believers.
@_date: 2019-05-11 09:22:49
If in doubt, become spiderman.

@_date: 2019-05-12 12:13:56
But how did they tip you back then? Did you have a wallet?

I'd like to see everybody get more freedom and happiness through bitcoin but you've earned it especially since you've been strictly bullish and positive around here forever now and through some dark times.
If bitcoin really does what we believe it will do I'll pop a cold beer and cheer you one.

@_date: 2018-12-28 17:37:58
Well written, imo. 
tldr: 2 coinceivable possibilities to inflate Bitcoin: 1. Bug. 2. Fork. Both about as likely as lightning striking your dickhole (paraphrased in my words).

Bitcoin is remarkably within it's historical pattern so far. Ath (2017), crash to about 80-85% from ath (2018), then entering bull phase and slow buildup approximately one year before the next halving. That's were we appear to be right now.

You have to be young enough to 'get' bitcoin aka grasp the tech at least rudimentarily yet old enough to have/make money to invest, which probably puts the average bitcoin enthusiast in an age bracket of say 18-45ish, generally leaning more in the younger direction.
So, no big surprise here. Propz, millenials.
