I stand corrected!

I never went with lamassu. Going with some skyhook units. They're open source and have a pretty passionate team behind them. Plus their units are very affordable, but sometimes that means the quality can be questionable. We'll see once I get going. This machine only accepts fiat, it doesn't dispense any.
So, I can just tie an exchange site into the ATM? This will allow people to withdraw Bitcoins from this online wallet, I just need to keep a large enough float in there. Do I have that right?

I don't get why so many people are hating on Max? I love this guy, he's taught me much. He's stance on fracking, his support of the BRICS, his constant promoting of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies as well as his site StartJoin which is quite a brilliant little platform for crowdfunding when you look into it. Max gets an A+ from me. Screw all you haters.

Well, I live in Vancouver BC, which is the Bitcoin capital of Canada, maybe even the world at this point. My first Skyhook ATM just arrive yesterday with 2 more scheduled to show up this fall. I hope to have 10 by the end of this year. 
Another company is already well ahead of me and has 30 ready to launch here in the city and else where in BC. 60 merchants in Metro Vancouver have already started accepting Bitcoin. This includes tattoo parlours, coffee shops, pubs and restaurants, local charities, etc. 
If you want to feel the Bitcoin buzz then move to Vancouver. It's everywhere!

Good one dude. You've got it. The noob in me can't figure out how to send the tip over reddit though. What's your wallet address? I'll just zap it over to you.
@_date: 2014-05-19 06:54:23
So what are you supposed to do with the fiat that's deposited into the ATM....?
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:01:33
May I ask what your source of info for this is? 
@_date: 2014-07-13 20:10:25
Haha I love that show, but with all due respect, I'm not going to kibosh an idea because comical satire tells me to. Realistically, the self created currency their depicting in this show is not tied to the global economy what so ever (it's not even crypto) so I think this is a little different.
The reason why I've posted this inquiry is in fact to look for answers. I'm just curious to hear what ideas are being thrown around out there about this because surely, I'm not the first one to visit this thought.
Now, obviously getting the schools and arena repaired is going to take a very strong effort from the community, I'm not saying that it isn't. But I think if you can start small, build up some confidence with Bitcoin, people may start to venture in that direction.
I was reading some posts from a merchant in Australia who owns their own chai tea business who has been accepting Bitcoin for just over a year. They switched over because of the money they could save from charge backs and debit/credit fees by offering their customers a discount on their product if they paid with Bitcoin. A year later and this merchant is now processing 40% of his transactions through Bitcoin. The amount of money he is saving is unparalleled and he is now able to leverage even MORE discounts towards the Bitcoin community. 
This is what helped inspire this post. If you can get a good chunk of townsfolk to start processing Bitcoin and they all agreed to help fund some community projects from the extra revenue generated, what is it that they couldn't do, really? All they need to do is try and keep as much money in the town as they could. Offering discounts with Bitcoin is a good start.  
They could help fund various social projects, especially if you got the municipal government involved. Bitcoin's price continues to grow too. We're seeing 10 fortune 500 companies gearing up to install Bitcoin payment options into their networks this fall which will undoubtedly cause Bitcoin to soar and finally complete it's mainstream status. Any merchant who has already adopted Bitcoin at this point will be in the drivers seat.
Anyways, back to my original thought. I don't necessarily believe this is a bad idea. I think with a little bit of head thumping, this could very well get off the ground. So let's try and discuss how that's practical.
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:05:48
Hmmm I guess so. You'd think they would have this thing stapled all over the internet by now, downloadable through a small payment of Bitcoins. 
I suppose the waiting game continues.
@_date: 2014-07-11 08:46:24
Look towards StartJOIN for some crowd funding! Lot's of success there! &gt;

How much is the exchange fee for buying Bitcoins on this site?

Probably not. Apple is a joke. Yes, they've set the ball in motion as far as smart phones go. But they wont let you expand too far outside of the apple 'world' with this new pick and choose approach.

Circle needs to hurry up and come to canada! 
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:13:02
Ok, I'm from Vancouver BC, so I hope you have a know how around Canadian jurisdictions. All I really need to know is how to figure out what my fees will be per month (service fees, maintenance fees, rental fees, etc.) I can't seem to find anything to compare with so as it stands, I can't tell if this is a money making idea or not. 
Judging from how the machine in Van operates, they need to supply their ATM with 300K per month, a chaperone who sits near by in order to educate new Bitcoin users for $12 an hour but also keeps vultures from setting up shop and trying to offer a lower exchange rate. A 7% service fee seems to be the standard for operating one of these things which equates to around 20K per month to cover all expenses? Again, all of this is 2nd hand information.

I've written an article for Crypto-Biza-Magazine, and am personally acquainted with the man who owns it. I never received a penny for my article. All they did was offer to put my Bitcoin address at the bottom of the article to receive tips. 
The drive, the sweat and the passion being put into this thing is outstanding and very inspirational. They've only released two issues so far. Give them a break, they just got here.
@_date: 2014-07-14 19:09:53
These are all very good ideas so far! Just so you guys know I'm going to wait a few hours before I decide

He may or may not have listed a few inquiries in his OP lol
@_date: 2014-07-04 01:44:16
So you don't believe that we're in the midst of a financial and economic revolution? Do me a favour and find me a financial system that has lasted longer than a century and a half without a rebellion. This monetary system is done. The jig is up. There are just far too many people in poverty, the gap too wide between the super rich and the middle class, far too much corruption and scandals that the house of cards is finally collapsing. What do you not trust about Bitcoin? Do you feel that it is being controlled or manipulated somehow? How are we all being setup? I'm very curious

I sent Skyhook an email asking them about the possibility of having to develop my own software. Here is their reply:
"You won't need to write software unless you decide you want to develop a plug-in for the admin, which is completely possible.
You will need to host the host the admin software on a server (or server as a service provider website) which will require you to enter commands into a terminal. The good news is we've created step-by-step instructions to guide you through the process.
Once hosted, the admin interface is quite friendly"

These guys sure take their time accepting join requests for this group. Any chance you could give them a nudge for me?
@_date: 2014-05-14 07:57:09
So how do I avoid needing a bank account? What am I supposed to do with all of the fiat deposited into the ATM machine?
@_date: 2014-08-16 19:34:56
Have you come across his crypto bullion he's been promoting on StartJoin? 3 pledges and he's sold out each one within hours. I don't think Maxcoin is going anywhere. But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:25:14
This is great. Financial scandals, political corruption, black government projects, cover ups, false flags, you name it, all can now be crowd funded wide open with Bitcoin. This is absolutely a brilliant idea IMO.
@_date: 2014-05-18 23:25:19
Have fun opening an account with a bank that will let you exchange crypto currencies through them. I'm having a hard time! BMO seems to be the best bet if you're living in Canada.
@_date: 2014-05-15 00:51:53
I appreciate the homework you've done on this subject. Sounds like the US has their hands full with getting these things off the ground. Thanks for your advice though, a lot of this applies to what I need to do in order to get going. Much thanks my friend :) 
@_date: 2014-07-04 00:58:03
You shouldn't blanket hate all politicians dude. My best friends mom is a political figure and she's a beautiful person with a very strong set of values who wants nothing more than to help people through politics. That being said, I'm going to assume that these people could very well just be as genuine. And even if they aren't, they've probably recognized how absolute crypto-currencies are and instead of fighting them with useless regulations and laws, they're embracing them and staying ahead of the game. After all, the blockchain could very easily be our new form of government some day.

Show everyone how to open up a wallet, set aside some bitcoins (a few $ worth) and send it to a student or two and have them pass it around the class. Hands on experiences are usually the most enlightening, at least to me that's the case. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:08:42
2015 is the year of the Bitcoin!
But it could also be 2016....
Maybe 2017 as well....

I'm still exploring that option, but I figured that if I can get this puppy working then I'll be saving myself 7k. I would like to exchange it, but the team at Project Skyhook has gone into hiding. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:04:21
I have read some other operators having the same issue, but was resolved once they upgraded from 0.76 to 0.78. But I'm already using 0.78 so it's got to be something else. Also, thank you for taking the time in helping me figure this one out. I really appreciate it. Take your time though, there is no rush.
