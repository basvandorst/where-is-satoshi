While it would be instantly profitable to dump $72 million in bitcoin, it would be more profitable to dump a little here and there.
It feels as if most of the drop was from people cashing out in fear of losing their coin.

I think we're just spitting out redundancy now...

I was logged into gox trying to make trades when it peaked and crashed. Reports show an averaged top value.
Actual peak was close to 1400.

I guess it's just a matter of perspective.

It's sad...but people don't realize that we're all still early adopters to bitcoin.
I remember a day when bitcoin crossed the 1 cent mark to the 2 cent mark.
I remember a day when bitcoin hit 380 and then a day after where it hit 40.
I remember a day when bitcoin hit 1400 and another day after where it hit 200.
I'm still not a millionaire.
Some day we will look back and be all "it's too bad I didn't buy in when it was under 10k"

Yeah, I hope to live long enough to see it reach mining for transaction fee's alone.
Even if civilization survives long enough for technology to progress beyond bitcoin it's nostalgic value would still hold weight.
