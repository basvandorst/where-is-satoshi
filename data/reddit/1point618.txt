Will this be a forced update for all Holiday Inn hotels, or an optional update, if it is rolled out?
How do you pay the deposit on the room? (Most hotels require a CC so that if you break anything, they can charge after the fact. How is HI dealing with this?)
What does success look like for this pilot? Simply that no one is scammed and it's not too hard? Or are they looking at increasing revenue numbers? Or at least hitting and sustaining a minimum ongoing BTC revenue?
Sorry I'm asking here, there are precious little details posted anywhere about this and I'm really curious.

Miners make more money right now by being a part of ghash.io than they do mining in any other way. 
Who can say what will happen in the future? Bitcoin might die without a 51% attack. Bitcoin might survive one with no issue.

Bingo. For these people, it is in their economic self-interest to mine on ghash. 
In addition, making the same amount of money on p2pool requires doing a lot more work than making money on ghash. Thus ghash wins again in terms of economic self-interest.

You're comparing apples to oranges. We were talking about the microeconomic effects of deflation on a single market. This was _your constraint_, remember? "Things that are good for merchants." Macroeconomic factors such as debt owed by the US _to other markets_ only matters if you can show that they had a direct effect on the microeconomic issues that we are talking about.


You just gave a 150 year time span. I assure you that the US wasn't the largest creditor in the world for most of it.
Furthermore, credit and debt don't work like you seem to think they do. We can and usually do both owe other countries and have countries that owe us. At no point in its history (except for a year in the early 1800s) has the US not been in debt. 
Finally, none of this really matters to the discussion at hand, which is "is deflation good for merchants?" Which it is not. 


If you think that this country has been run into the ground, then you aren't paying attention. Spend some time traveling. It will be enlightening.

This whole thing is my new favorite example of why objectivism fails.
When people act only in their own self interest and there are no other rules, society becomes destabilized.
In order for "everyone act only in your own self interest" to work, there need to be rules, incentives, and punishments ensuring that individual self interest and society's interests align.
As this example shows, in the real world personal profit and societal stability rarely align. Individuals profit more in the short term when they are a part of the biggest pool. Thus more people move towards the biggest pools.
Which is bad for Bitcoin.

In a world where the bitcoin price moves percent points daily, even "spending all of your bitcoin every pay period" does not prevent exposure to price volatility.

No problem. I just wish I could be helpful by having a good solution for you rather than pooh-poohing all the others. But no, it's not simple or risk-free at all.
If you really want to go the BTC route, your best bet might be to find someone you trust who wants a lot of BTC and sell the BTC directly to them, off-exchange. Or if you do use Vault of Satoshi, contact the owners first. You'll be one of their biggest customers, so they can probably drop your fees and work with you to make sure everything goes smoothly. Your account being a 10% increase in monthly trade volume means that you represent a 10% increase in their monthly revenue. Use that leverage to your advantage.
But to be clear, I have no idea whether this would be illegal or not, nor the tax implications, nor the implications of the sanctions. The "ask a lawyer" thing is not trying to scare you off, just admitting that I don't know and that it's a large enough sum of money that you'll want to cover those bases.

I really don't understand what you're trying to get at. You keep saying that using ints to store these values means converting back and forth to floating point numbers. Why would you do that? You lose all the benefits of using an int if you do, and it's 100% unnecessary.

You're right, cloud services are less centralized than mainframes were, but gmail (for instance) is more centralized than email used to be, when people would host email clients and even servers on their machines. There are efficiencies in centralization, just as there is robustness in decentralization. "Centralized" and "decentralized" will always be overly simplistic terms, because the world is messy and often takes the middle path between our conceptual dichotomies.
This isn't about that, though. 
I'm sorry that you're upset, that was never my intention. I honestly thought we were agreeing on the larger point even while disagreeing on the particulars, and if I came off as hostile or unkind, I apologize. 
My offer still stands, now or in the future. I talk to someone and it's very useful. Feeling angry all the time isn't fun, but it's really hard to disentangle from that feeling when we hide it from ourselves, or pretend that we like it, or pretend that it's actually another feeling.

That's totally why people think marriage is about love. There's definitely not be literature for centuries about marriage as an institution of love. Shakespeare definitely never wrote about lovers getting married to consummate their love. Frank Sinatra never sang about love leading to marriage. 
None of those things happened. None of them have any bearing one why people associate marriage as a logical conclusion of a loving relationship, nor love necessary for marriage.
It's only because of the modern gay rights movement.

No, having a thing run correctly should be a programmer's first priority. You're the one losing the forrest (user and business goals) for the trees (startupy programmer frameworks). 
When it comes to financial applications, having math work out perfectly, 100% of the time, no matter what, is the only definition of running correctly. Otherwise you'll pull a Gox and the numbers your pushing between database values won't actually be representative of the money you have in your bank account.

I know. It's crazy. This isn't like a hard problem or a difficult concept or anything. 
The way you know whether to use an int or a float is not "does it have a decimal place?", but "do I care more about accuracy or the size of the set of all possible numbers I can represent". When it comes to money, the choice is clearly that you care more about accuracy.

What's more, "sexy tech" will make merchants more money than a slight reduction of fees will.
If I'm a merchant, I'd much rather a payment system that makes it as easy as possible for people to spend money with me, even if that payment system costs me slightly more than alternatives. Why? Because a 1% increase in my margins is nice, but there's a small marginal return on it. Whereas I can much more easily grow my business by getting more people to buy my products. 
Thus, good user experience design ("sexy tech") is revenue-generating and profit-generating. More so than a tiny increase in margin is.

Thanks. I hope it's helpful to the OP—although I just noticed that it's another 0-day account which hasn't even bothered replying to this thread once. We sure get a lot of those here. 


In theory. Arbitrage in BTC-land doesn't happen very efficiently, and seeing the top 4 exchanges trading at a consistent $10 spread is the normal state of affairs. 
Also, selling it over a week means that you'll have to deal with bitcoin's volatility. Over the past week, Vault of Satoshi's highest trade was $560/BTC, and lowest was $515/BTC. That's an 8% variance over the week, and that's a pretty calm week on the exchange. Within the past few months, there have been multiple weeks with a 14-16% variance. 
Even ignoring exchange fees, that would be a tough sell for most businesses. Better than not getting the money at all, sure. But it's a lot of work and time and risk to make it happen. 


From what I can tell, global bitcoin/fiat exchange is on the order of 25,000 BTC per day. 80k CAD is a drop in the bucket, so there's that at least.
Vaguely related, it's surprisingly hard to find any good global volume numbers. I had to go to bitcoin charts, calculate average daily volume by dividing the last week's volume by 7 separately for each exchange, and then guestimate the volume at the littler guys. 
There are automated charts to slice and compare BTC price across any number of exchanges a thousand ways to Tuesday, but even finding basic trade volume numbers is rather difficult.
It's also worth mentioning to the OP that Russia is under economic sanctions right now, and part of the reason that money transfer is difficult could be _legal_ ones. I'd highly recommend contacting a lawyer before doing this, both to make sure that you're declaring taxes properly and to make sure that accepting this money in this way doesn't accidentally put you on the wrong side of the law.

Whatever people code it to do.
It's pretty trivial to write a contract that collects donations, and then sends those donations to another entity on the Ethereum network once a certain threshold has been reached. Bam, the base kickstarter functionality in several lines of code. It can even take donations in BTC, Doge, or whatever, instead of Ether—the Ether only needs to get sent as a sort of "running fee", which gets paid to the computers on the network that actually run the code. 
Contracts are full and complete agents on the Ethereum network. They can do anything a human could on the network. So pretty much they're building a distributed economic network of simple Artificial Intelligences that can speak to each other and pay each other to run.

Just because a number is represented by people with a decimal place, doesn't mean that number should be represented by computers as a floating point number. 
For numbers that require 100% accuracy and aren't arbitrarily divisible, such as numbers representing money, you should just use an int and then add the decimal to the correct place in the UI. If you use a float, then you're sacrificing something you need (accuracy) for something that you don't need (arbitrary precision). 
BTC isn't arbitrarily precise. It's specifically precise. You cannot divide a satoshi. And thus it is best represented as an int.

Hey One question. In English, "a few" usually means "a small but significant number", whereas "few" usually means "a small and insignificant number".

Those are your words. The words that I am replying to. Paypal is not irrelevant, which you very well know, because it is the competition to changetip.


No, says the entire field of economic history, not to mention lean startup methodology and user experience design.
Innovation (defined as the wide-scale adoption of new technologies) is not an easy or simple process. The "if you build it, they will come" mantra almost always works out poorly for the builders. 
Invention is, by comparison, rather easy. Large businesses project manage invention all the time. We know about when and how well new inventions will be established if we just crank away at them. 
Driving user adoption, on the other hand, is a very difficult process. You have to not just build an invention that solves problems for individuals and opens up new avenues of economic efficiency for society, but you also have to convince individuals _en masse_ to change their behavior. 
This takes marketing, politics, sales, and more. It takes understanding the _human_ factors that go into technological adoption. At the end of the day, no technology succeeds without humans. These are creative fields which see some degree of process but which are ever-changing. Solutions have to fit the specific technology, consumer market, legal framework, etc.. 
A good example of innovation vs. invention is Edison vs. Tesla. We all know the popular geek narrative, that Tesla was a lone genius whose work was suppressed by the evil, profit-hungry Edison. But really, the difference was one of innovation. Both men were greatly inventive, but only one of them cared to focus on marketing, user adoption, working with governments, and building a business. It's telling that the one major "success" that Tesla did have was the one where he engaged with Edison on his own turf, taking the AC/DC battle to local governments and the courts. 
But at the end of the day, Tesla the inventors legacy is a yet-to-be-built museum crowdfunded by a webcomic author, while Edison's legacy is one of the oldest, largest, and most inventive consumer companies in the US.
If you'd like to learn more, I'd highly recommend [_The Lever of Riches_ by Joel Mokyr]( He uses historical examples from Europe, the Americas, and China to develop a historical narrative and theory of technological and economic progress (aka, innovation) that helps explain why certain technologies see adoption, as well as why certain societies see more technological innovation than others. And if you're interested in the latter question, [_Why Nations Fail_ by Acemoglu and Robinson]( is a very enjoyable read.

Not for business, it's not. Investment and so-called frivolous spending is what drives the economy. It's why merchants can exist. 


Maybe good for consumers. Definitely bad for merchants.


Interest rates aren't the biggest problem (although they are one, and while they adjust they don't do so in a way that's good for people trying to get loans). 
The issue for merchants is that while the amount of money they bring in gets smaller and smaller (that is, the products they sell cost less and less because deflation), the loan stays the exact same size. Thus, it becomes very difficult to ever pay off the loan. Startup capital thus becomes incredibly hard to come by. 


It doesn't matter what causes deflation, it's the effects on society that count. And those are the same regardless of the cause.


Yes, and they realized that, and they have never done it again. Just because someone makes a mistake doesn't mean they can't learn from it, and just because an institution has fucked up doesn't mean that the response is to completely get rid of that institution.

Those are dangerous, and lead to situations such as this one, where you think that because when we represent BTC in writing we use a decimal point, that thus BTC is best represented by a floating point number. This is mixing up the high-level representation of BTC (decimal points) for the low-level implementation (indivisible satoshis).
And yes, if you look at what I wrote, you will see that not only do I perfectly understand what low-level means, I'm advocating that you begin to think at a lower level, because if you don't you're going to end up writing bad code in this case.

Money shouldn't be represented by float numbers, though.
Float numbers are not precise. You can start with 1 thing, do nothing but add and subtract it to itself, and end up with slightly more or slightly less than 1 thing. And these errors compound. 
This is unacceptable behavior when your problem's domain is money. When the problem's domain is money, the computer's domain _becomes your problem_.
You're getting caught up because the formatting we use on USD, BTC, etc., seems to point them being floating point numbers. They're not, however, they're integers—we just arbitrarily add a decimal place to make them more easily human readable. 
Thus, the best way to actually deal with these kinds of numbers is to treat them as integers at the smallest possible division point, and then just add the decimal place in in the UI.

What does this even mean? Early majority? Majority of what? Compared to what? Is this like saying that getting 10 people out of a hundred to vote for something is an early majority? Because in the world I live in, that's a clear minority.


This is so astoundingly incorrect. 
If this were true, then Go Cross Campus would have been a resounding success. 
If this were true, then startups would focus all their energy on acquiring college users.
If this were true, then no one would use twitter.
The truth is that college students are a very bad predictor of the tech ecosystem because they don't tend to spend money on technology. Any startup whose business model relies on consumers giving them money will crash and burn if they go after the college market. 
The one place this has held true, the only one I know of at least, is Facebook. But Facebook was a special case: it requires a high network density to be useful for any individual once it's mature. A social network without any of your friends on it is worthless. So they were lucky in that they (1) when they were immature, they fulfilled a need specific to college students (connecting with others on campus) in a way that allowed them to achieve high network densities quickly, and (2) did a very good job of growing with their user base in order to quickly become useful for non-college students.

That's not how technological change works. Technological innovation only happens insomuch as people are willing and able to adopt a technology. There are plenty of instances of technologies that would have been changed society _not_ gaining widespread use and thus _not_ changing society. 
Things like "bitcoin ah-ha moments" point to it being more likely to gain some sort of acceptance and thus change society, but it's by no means a given and if you dismiss those who "aren't willing do adapt" and that bucket of people is large enough, then you're the one who is going to be out of lockstep, not them.

Arguing it isn't good because it hasn't matured yet should be a reason for people to work to make it better, not to defend it because it isn't mature yet.
The internet didn't magically become better when more people used it. Roads didn't magically get paved once enough people were using cars. It took vast amounts of manpower and money to build the infrastructure to a point that people wanted to use them.
Yes, you have found bitcoin's disruption point, the vector along which adoption starts because it does one thing better than all the other things on the market. But that alone isn't enough for disruption—the technology has to be continuously getting better and better and better in order to do more and more things that the entrenched players do.
The problem with bitcoin is that this isn't a technological problem. It's a [slow idea]( one that takes more than building a solid product and letting people use it. You need to build an entire infrastructure around the product, a people-focused system that lets users _use_ bitcoin in a way they can't now. 
It's a lot of hard work, but it must be done for continued adoption of cryptocurrencies. That's why saying "when this gets rolling they won't need to convert" is somewhat dishonest—it's up to the current users to get the ball rolling, to get everything to the point where we don't have to convert. It's that infrastructure that is going to convince the general public that they can use bitcoin. 
It won't just magically happen because enough people are using bitcoin. You have to build an entire financial system and economy in order for them to come. Not just a technology.

Just be careful: buying that much BTC in one go is likely to drive up the price of BTC on their exchange, and selling it in one go is likely to drive down the price on your exchange. The order books on these things are pretty thin, particularly Vault of Satoshi (which a number of people are recommending you use). If you were to drop 60k CAD worth of BTC on VoS right now, you'd increase its 24 hr trading volume by 200%, and increase the 7 day volume by 25%. So that means that even if you slowly converted those 115 BTC to CAD over the course of a week, you'd constitute over 1/5th of the trading volume for that week. 
Also, everyone here is suggesting the Russians use BTC-e. While this exchange has been operating fine for a while, it bears mentioning that the people running it are completely anonymous, are based in an undisclosed location (people speculate somewhere in Eastern Europe / Russia), don't communicate with the outside world, and have never been audited by an outside entity. So for this to work, you have to convince your clients to trust this shadowy organization with 2 million rubles a month. At least they have a much higher trading volume, about 5000 BTC / day (compared to Vault of Satoshi's 50 BTC / day). 
edit: I just realized that I did all my calculations with 60k CAD, not 80k. So selling that on Vault of Satoshi in one day would increase their trading volume by 300%, selling it in one week would increase their volume by over a third. Even selling it slowly over the entire month, you alone would increase their volume by 10%.

A/B tests are not designed to test such a thing, so no that's not taken into consideration.
However, it should be pointed out that they gain the same amount of traffic regardless of where they put the "pay with bitcoin" button, so if they make more money per visitor with it hidden away, then it's still in their best interest to (1) "accept" bitcoin through some back channel while (2) making the payment landing page as optimized as possible.


Read the study again. It _was_ on the payment page, and when it was they were making much less money than when it wasn't. 
When they moved it off the landing page, they (1) got all the benefits of accepting bitcoin while (2) not having the downside of having too many payment options on the landing page.

That's exactly the problem! In criminal proceedings, both sides have a right to know what the other side is going to bring into court as evidence. It gets presented to the public in a dramatic fashion, but you're not allowed to sit on your evidence/testimony/etc without telling the other side what that evidence/testimony will be.
The court's reasoning behind upholding the government's position is quite readable.
tl;dr: You can't call witnesses at the last minute and refuse to say what they're going to testify about. Especially expert witnesses. The court has told the defense this multiple times and given them more time to prepare statements on the witnesses, and they haven't done it even so. So the prosecution, whose case rests tomorrow, will have no chance to respond to the testimony of these expert witnesses. 
Now, this rule goes both ways, but the prosecution has upheld their end of the bargain months in advance, and its days in advance and the defense still refuses to give any indication to either the court or prosecution what the witnesses are going to say, what their opinions are, etc.. The court is honestly flabbergasted by the behavior of the defense, isn't happy with the situation, and tried to find ways around it, but it's just way too of a cut and dry case of the defense attempting to ambush the prosecution. This isn't allowed. Thus, motion upheld.
