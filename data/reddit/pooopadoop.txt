Sell your btc for usd and use usd to pay your bills...... super secret hidden trick.
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:00:28
Btc isn’t peer to peer.... the transactions need to be validated by others.
Me giving my friend a $20 bill is peer to peer.
@_date: 2018-12-07 15:27:01
Dumb money scoffed at $3k last year, dumb money thinks $20k next year is possible.
@_date: 2018-12-17 13:34:09
No there isn’t.

The way you are speaking of CEOs, you are referring to CEOs who are employees not employers...
Businesses owners have a risk premium.... employees don’t.
Investments have a risk of loss, kinda weird how you are having a difficult time acknowledging this.

US workers make more now than they did in the 70s even adjusted for inflation.... 
We are wasting time talking with each other so I’m not going keep at it with you.

You paid money to take a course on bitcoin......?

“Growth redistribution”
Wtf is growth redistribution.... you mean stealing the product from productive people to give to unproductive people?
You know who makes that argument...? Weak, in-effective people who don’t want to take responsibility for their own actions and decisions.
People making no money will also be making no money in the future, that is truly a useless metric to point to and be basing an argument from.
Like I said before, you are a waste of time to continue on with.
Good luck being a miserable weak hand.
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:08:15
Why does it “have to” reach a new ATH?
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:04:24
I see this one is also going to be a waste of my time, cheers buddy.

HODLERs will be forced to sell to pay their bills during the upcoming recession.

Funny how bubbles look similiar

Stores of value don’t routinely lose 85% of their value.

The biggest flaw to any btc long thesis is the simple fact that btc is replicatable. Any developer can create another bitcoin on another blockchain.... in fact this is already occurring. There is no moat. Every altcoin that comes on line devalues your bitcoin as it is indirect inflation.
There is no comparison to gold as gold isn’t replicatable.
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:19:08
Looks like you are going to be parted with your money.
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:49:17
Because bitcoin is poo.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:08:42
Are you going to admit that you would have let him pay you 1 btc if he lost while at the same time knowing full well you had no intention of paying if you lost?
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:34:12
Lol okay dude. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:28:47
That’s an ambiguous term.
Has its use, popularity, and value peaked and currently declining..... absolutely.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:17:52
Blockchain is the internet, bitcoin is AOL.
You can have blockchain without bitcoin, you can’t have bitcoin without the blockchain. 
A developer can straight up replicate bitcoin in another blockchain..... this is why bitcoin has no intrinsic value.

Might as well cash out and take the $150 and go to the casino... that will be more fun.

I need to show you pay stubs to prove the basic concept that business owners have a risk premium...?
I get to go home at the end of the day knowing that at worst, I get fired. I design/manage multi million dollar infrastructure projects, if I screw up I could cost my employer millions and the worst that happens to me is I would have to look for a new job.... that kind of risk imbalance is why employers get a risk premium on my time. That’s the case with essentially every employer employee relationship. 
You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and realize how toxic your attitude is.... there’s a reason you are not achieving what you want in life, and it has nothing to do with “exploitive employers”.
If you want proof that wages have been steadily increasing (even adjusted for inflation) here’s the proof.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:22:43
Meanwhile in the land of real economic statistics....
Real wages for Americans have been increasing steadily.
I’d suggest not relying on shit tier political fluff for your economic research.
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:15:31
Because it was a bubble...?
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:13:35
If he thought btc was going to kill MasterCard he would follow the profits and invest in bitcoin.... so no, that’s not why he doesn’t like bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:24:06
Lol.... how’s that store of value coming?
*checks prices*
Yup, still down 85% from last years high.

*What if your friend is using one of those currency checking pens manufactured in China?*
That doesn’t make the cash transaction not peer to peer... and I’ve never had anyone do this in real life
*What if your friend is looking up the current paper security features of the $20 published by the U.S. government website?*
That doesn’t make the cash transaction not peer to peer... and I’ve never had anyone do this in real life
*What if you need to check that the $20 wasn't inflated (yet again) to make sure you don't actually need to pay them $25 instead?*
That doesn’t make the cash transaction not peer to peer... and I’ve never had anyone do this in real life
*What if you need to verify that this $20 isn't a high-resolution photocopy?*
That doesn’t make the cash transaction not peer to peer... and I’ve never had anyone do this in real life
*What if you need to check if the currency hasn't completely destabilized like in Venezuela?*
That doesn’t make the cash transaction not peer to peer... and I’ve never had anyone do this in real life
*What if the $20 came from a bank ATM that may freeze your account?*
That doesn’t make the cash transaction not peer to peer...
*There's always validation and external dependencies. The question is how much is under the control by powerful people using their power and politics for personal gain, versus something that doesn't depend on trust?*
Transferring a bitcoin to a peer is only possible if it’s validated by others on the blockchain network. It is not peer to peer
Me giving a friend a $20 bill requires no one else in the process.... it is peer to peer.
@_date: 2018-12-07 06:25:28
You mean low income people continue making low incomes....?
By definition.... they are making low income which tend not to rise, by definition of the concept of low income.
Using that instead of the median or mean income is pants on the head retarded.
lol I don’t even feel bad that you are losing your shirt in a bubble market, you would have found failure in just about anything you tried.

“In order to earn money you need to exploit and spoil employees of the true value of their work....”
I earn money as an employee and my employer is not exploiting me.
Their is a risk to owning a company, most companies created have gone bankrupt... there is a risk premium that employers have that is entirely reasonable and quite dramatic and ditzy to call “exploitive”.
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:24:02
Why tho
