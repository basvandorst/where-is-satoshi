Here in Mexico you can see that we are in bubble. People are borrowing money from the bank to buy Bitcoin, using the credit card to get some cash from the ATM and then buying with that cash some BTC. The fees are fucking high!!! I'm sure this is happening in other countries, usually less informed people who wants to get rich quickly...

Here in Mexico we removed 3 zeros to our currency a few years ago. Is a simple solution.

Cant install it. After I download the files from 21.co it ask me to connect the pi with a usb to serial cable, already did that and still ask me the same. Any idea what to do next?

Thanks for your comment. I hope I can test your software in my raspberry pi, I want to buy a bitcoin 21 but unfortunately you don't ship to Mexico yet. Any timeframe when you plan to do it?
