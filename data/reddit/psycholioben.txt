There is honestly no reason for ether to try to balance between decentralized  and not like it’s doing now.  It might as well be centralized as it would already be difficult and expensive to audit the history. I think eos is more promising because it won’t try to balance.

Considering LN is trustless and can be routed anywhere around the world,  anonymous “black market” hubs are possible.  Regulating LN with KYC would be about as effective as regulating the main chain.  
Edit: Now that I’ve listened to the entire podcast I think you misheard him.  He said that it would be impossible to regulate KYC because everyone with a wallet would essentially be a “hub” and transmitter, and if they tried the hubs would simply move out of the country.  He also said it is unlikely giant hubs would exist because this would require them to have a lot of money in hot wallets opening them to hacks.

Ok, maybe you’re a bit slow, so I’ll explain.
Bitcoin has value as a decentralized trustless ledger (“bitcoin” can be synonymous with the currency, the ledger, and the network).  Just like the internet which derives value from its network *and* its practical application, replicating bitcoin would derive less value because it doesn’t have the same network.

The first and foremost reason why bitcoin is valuable is because it is decentralized.  If cheap and fast transactions are all you care about, Visa etc accomplish this just fine.  Bitcoin is decentralized, secure, and has the largest network and greatest brand.  Beyond this it is open-source and updatable. 
Cheap and fast transactions come second and only once security and decentralization are upheld. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:16:20
I’m interested to see how it plays out.  They will begin as a federated sidechain pegged to the price of bitcoin, so as not to compete with bitcoin and to also make cheap fast transactions.  They have claimed they eventually want to make the sidechain decentralized yet still pegged but I have no idea how they will accomplish this. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:23:00
Bitcoin 2.0 wouldn’t have the same network.

@_date: 2018-01-04 14:00:14
I agree, people are speculating and looking for increases.  Many alts are compromising decentralization and security in order to process more transactions, when Visa could simply accomplish the same thing if all you want is speed and affordability.  The network effect is the most important part of a decentralized open-source updatable currency.

MySpace and Facebook are companies.  Bitcoin is an open-source, consensus based network. 
Like you said cryptos would be an awful store of value if everyone just switched to a different one all the time, and being a store of value is not backwards compatible with being a medium of exchange.  If something is a bad store of value it is inherently a bad medium of exchange, but not vice-versa.  
Considering bitcoin can be updated, is open-source and consensus based, there is no reason to constantly switch to new networks anytime one claims to do something slightly better.  It would make commerce cumbersome and decrease the utility. 
Or maybe you’re here to argue against cryptos all together?

Bank fraud was more common when your bank account number was written on all your checks that people used more often.  Now people use debit cards which are only better in that they can be changed without having to completely change your account.  Still common for people to steal the debit card information.  Only recently have they started using encryption with the chip readers

@_date: 2017-08-20 23:19:01
I'm sorry the quotations didn't suffice, but I don't believe in "intrinsic" value.  I'm honestly surprised that Schiff brings it up so often being an Austrian economist.  There is only subjective value.
For example, gold may be very good at reflecting radiation, but perhaps there is a method of arranging a cheaper metal to accomplish the same thing, or perhaps reflecting radiation isn't necessary to very many people.  The gold doesn't have intrinsic value, only intrinsic properties that people currently find useful.
Saving people money on fees and removing many third-party middle men are intrinsic properties of bitcoin, these directly relate to a utility value only because it is very clear that most people will probably find these properties valuable.

There is very little that Bitcoin can't do or couldn't be updated to do compared with other cryptocurrencies.  An environment where the dominant cryptocurrency is based on relatively minor differences, ones that could possibly be integrated, is an unstable surface for use as a currency, which is at least one of the functions of the blockchains, if not the dominant function. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 23:36:30
There is a very big difference between fiat currencies and decentralized cryptocurrencies.  Fiat currencies are centrally controlled by competing governments.  Buying multiple currencies is a hedge against each governments' control over the currencies, but bitcoin is a network; there is not centralized control.  Having competing blockchains is like having competing internets.  There will be competing protocols but there will likely be a standard network.

I don't think this is something that people will need convincing of; it will naturally occur.

A predictable and constant deflation is not a disincentive to spend once more people are in (the market cap is still less than 0.1% of the economy, so price swings are high).  According to Austrian school economics, the opposite of central banking economics, a predictable rate of deflation (roughly on par with birthrate and liquidity) is conducive to sustainable and prosperous markets.  I mean think about it, is it better to have numbers on a screen or things and services?  The more the price rises the more incentive you have to buy things.

We are still very early.  As adoption continues volatility drops.  Holding currencies, even gold, has historically been a less valuable investment than the economy. (Depending on timing of course, but generally)
Besides I still use bitcoin but I’m much more conservative with my spending habits.  I think a deflationary currency encourages wiser investments and consumption.

I want to accept it for my business if there are any losses I’ll take the hit but I don’t exactly have people knocking the doors down to pay with crypto as it is so I’d really just like to be able to advertise it and stay ahead of the curve. 
Btw I work with relatively high volume low ticket items so if it works say 80% of the time I’ll be happy to give that 20% discount to LN pioneers as a way to test the network.

That would be injecting fiat into the economy which would contribute to inflation.  Unless they did this in small quantities insignificant enough to prop up the government, they could only do this if they were bailing out of fiat before the rest of the economy knew.  This would end in hyperinflation and chaos very quickly.  I don’t think it’s a likely scenario because many of those people would lose their power if this happened; they’re more methodical than that.  I think it’s much more likely they integrate it into a more involved tax system to accumulate.

Haha with crypto the shoeboys were first.  
A decentralized scarce currency matters to them more.  
Institutions and accredited investors are mad they couldn’t get in on it before it hit the public.

Non-mining nodes aren’t necessary for the network, but they are necessary to validate and audit the blockchain without trusting a third party.  This is paramount to decentralization.

It’s called immutability and the precedent has been set for a slippery slope.
I hear Vitalik is a communist;  not the kind of person I would give the power to determine who deserves what money.  
Really I wouldn’t give anyone that ability without a proper trial.  And then the money should be retrieved in a proper manner not a hard fork.

Networks don’t typically work the way companies do in a market.  First mover advantage for a network is much much more significant than it is for a company.  Bitcoin is a network.  It is the most secure because it has focus on decentralization and it is the largest with the the most infrastructure built on it. 
Blockchains are valuable as a network.  Networks by definition are interconnected which alts are not.  The block chain will only continue being valuable as it becomes more interconnected not less.  Just like the internet in the beginning there were many different “better” protocols competing,  but we settled on one because networks derive their value in interconnectivity.

I believe the stock market would better function on blockchain too. If RSKs sidechain works this could potentially increase the total market cap of bitcoins network even higher.

Lowering interest rates is how they pump up the economy and make it appear as though there is growth.  Taking this away would diminish their power and make the economy recede back to its normal levels.
I think it’s more likely they try to accumulate bitcoin and gold and/or fighting it as best they can.

First it’s synonymous with printing money. More money in the economy makes it feel like it’s booming until inflation hits; it’s like a high from a drug, it isn’t sustainable. 
Second people are incentivized to spend money on investments to get out of the depreciating dollar, therefore boosting the stock market etc.

Don’t confuse regulation with government action.  There are plenty of ways markets self regulate, which are clearly valuable to the consumer.
Sometimes government gets it right, but I’m sure any positive thing the government does would be done better by the market.

People price things in terms of fiat because it is the easiest way to describe purchasing power to the common person.

If we break 93, I’ve got an upside around 98, with another dip back to 9ish.  Then if we can break out of 98 again, I’ve got an upside target around 12.

Exactly, if bitcoin is obsoletable the question becomes whether crypto actually has any value at all
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:47:28
No, it's a network between everyone with channels open.  So anyone else who has a channel open with the vendor plus whoever they have channels open with etc, effectively connecting the whole economy through one open channel between you and some vendor. 
@_date: 2019-09-10 04:47:50
And if it is objectively better why wouldn’t the bitcoin network just adopt the changes without anyone having to switch ledgers?

The federal reserve prints money and loans it to subsidiary banks at low interest rates this is where banks get most of the money they loan out and why they give such small rates. 
Low interest rates and printing money go hand in hand.

I imagine a world where the stock market moves to blockchains and sidechains, cutting out the middleman and saving costs, with more transparency, and less risk.  I want to know if Bitcoin will be able to tap into this market as well as the currency market.
