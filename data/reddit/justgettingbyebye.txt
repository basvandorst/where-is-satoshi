For a subreddit that keeps preaching that bitcoin is a long term play, it sure gets flustered by short term movements. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:25:13
Bitcoin is popular Bc I'm told they can be redeemed for lambos.

Except everyone here is hodling. If everyone hodls instead of spending, then what's the point of accepting? If most people don't use credit cards, then what's the incentive for a store to take a 3% fee for credit card using customers? Hodls preaching that spending Bitcoin is better than cash, but y'all using cash instead of btc.

I wonder if aliens want us to mine for gold. Earth is basically an extraterrestrial colony for some alien empire.

Yes, there a lot of poor people in Venezuela. Doesn't mean there aren't any rich people either. They control the wealth there. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:14:13
If you use btc, do you need to pay taxes on the gain at exchange?
@_date: 2018-04-01 20:37:32
But does anyone actually pay with it? 
@_date: 2018-04-07 07:51:31

Yall need to see the bigger picture. Draw a line from 0 to the all time high. I didn't take quantum physics in hs, but the trend line is still pointing to the moon. Lambo up Boyz! Steph may not have believed in the moon landings in the past, but he sure will believe this ride! 
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:29:47
No need to withdraw if you think bitcoin is the future. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:17:08
