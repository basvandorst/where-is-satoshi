How does this relate to the question?
* Is it that the creators have to be motivated by dominating another currency to implement new features?
* Is it the fear of failure?
* Is it the the accomplishment of being better than another team? 
Why is the idea of competition important? If they dominate and win, why is that different than what the Banks did? And if the goal is to compete for domination and suppremacy, what is to stop the victor from imposing new restrictions if they become the only choice?
And if your argument is the varried choices are what drive innovation, than how is the fragmented marketplace better for the end user?

Why do you think the suppliers (the producers and coders behind Crypto currencies) need competition to make these improvements?
I may be content, you could always ask.

Why do you feel people need to feel competitive to make these improvements?

It's not about wanting something better. It's your main premise that competition is the seed of innovation... Why do you think that competition is better? Why must someone be motivated by besting someone else to create something better?
Now just we are clear. I don't know the right answer.

What is it about compeition that good *specifically* for you?

If you take away money from this whole story. And we look at Greece from the point of view of contributions to the world, what are they up to?

Why do you think freedom is equal to capitalism?
@_date: 2016-02-04 12:43:40
But what happens when the opposing party has more than you? Is that party more free?
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:34:48
What is freedom for you?
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:15:43
loserkids: do you think capitalism is freedom?
@_date: 2016-02-22 13:00:43
Because it's aberrant behaviour to steal something like that.

You can't

I think you are being fooled to believe... Once again that the solution to being oppressed is creating another tool which can be used to oppress you. Bitcoin is not going to save the corrupt institutions. These institutions are corrupt because people think enslaving others to afford them more leisure will give them happiness... Will Bitcoin curb this behavior?
Do you believe that by enslaving others and having all this free time to do nothing will give you happiness? Do you idolize the rich who enslave you?

You ever hear of the Tullip economy of the Netherlands?

We should have a "doomsday" coin who's value is directly tied to people believing that Bitcoin is a risky/overvalued liability.

Is centralization the problem? Lets imagine a city which has one water treatment plant. The treatment plant is having technical problems and the water is not drinkable until the issue is resolved. What is the solution?

If money was less important to people would the problem persist?
@_date: 2016-07-11 11:32:40
It's a bit challenging, because a lot of the comments to me are suspicious... How many people want to get rich off of Bitcoin?

What you describe sounds like it would be relavent in ancient Rome.
