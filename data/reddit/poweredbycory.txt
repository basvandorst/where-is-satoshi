I agree. Good advice and he obviously doesn't understand the leverage that sum of money could provide. 
Source: Am 25 year old making $50k/year - have $22k in my savings, put 12% into 401k a year, own my car out right and have no debt. I grew up with a step mother who owned a small business that grossed 25-50 million in sales yearly (sold it in 2016 for a fat stack of cash). She leverages money like nobodies business. I watched her take $250k and double/triple it multiple times. 
Watched her Buy a $500k lakehouse ($200k down), have other peoples money pay the mortgage (renting it to other wealthy families). Pay the shit off with my friends parents money (renters), renovate it and sell it for $125k more then what she bought it for. All while having a vacation home on the water that was about 3 hours away. We had it for 5 years and used it 1-2 a month. she basically spent $300k to own a dope 5 bedroom lake house then turn around and sell it for $625k for a net profit of $325k.
Its crazy what can be done when you are in the position to 1. leverage larger sums of money 2.Take risks 3.Understand specifically how you intend on profiting. My father ended up divorcing my step mother over money. He saw it all as greed or the need to be flashy or impress. Ended up causing fights over... well I guess all the money... I never understood it. My step mother just thinks like a business person 24/7, I believe she may have ended up being one of my biggest influences, even beyond my dad or mom. I don't think id have the mindset to have the money I do now if it wasn't for her.
I hope I one day can build some wealth. I understand there is little chance for me to end up making the kind of income shes able to, and even less of a chance to build the net worth she has. But maybe just maybe I can reach 6 figures yearly and I can have my own smaller leverage oppurtunies.  
There is always the dream though. 3 cars, two houses and plenty of $$ left over every month. Must be nice!
