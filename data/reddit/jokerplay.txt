Do anyone feel that Bitstamp move to suspend is a bit over reactive/weird? (I know this is a good thing for customer protection) I can only see two reason. Tons of user got tricked and/or they leaked their customer's email. And to do the first you must have the latter?

What about an evil big entity targeting multiple specific big pool's owners? Isn't that very possible since there's less than 10 big pools? Miners only option would be solo-mining.

Maybe he is a douchebag in real life.
But response to a unexpected event like this is a norm and not rude. Sure he can be more friendly and get cookie points by giving him the answer he wants and invite him for a cup of tea. Business has to be professional, you dont offer give any answer carelessly. You don't give special treatment either. This is like running over to your local mayor or governor asking can he plow the snow in your street by tonight after they made a PSA that they are trying their best to plow the entire city.
I'm not justifying MTGox service but the response he gave to this guy. I'm also a MTGox user.

This is why i think tourist shops(small or big), hotels should start accepting bitcoin. No need to deal with currency exchange or credit card acceptance.

You might also want to backup (with encryption) the 2fa code (screenshot) .

well it's a way out for the criminal to "safely" get the 500 BTC and not have a bounty for the rest of his life

Might be able to if there's a Bitcoin ATM machine nearby :)

Do you use any chrome extension/add-ons?

There are. Stocks are bought by Bitcoins and dividends are Bitcoins. Kinda cool. So what happens then?
Example:

Threaten the owner's life to take control over their pool and do bad things. The big evil entity doesn't exactly need to create a pool, but have the capability to control pool's owner(by force). Of course this is theoretical but if any evil-doer(US Gov? Dr. Evil?) want to fuck things up, this is probably the best way.

Investment is risky. Sometimes people get "unlucky" and doesn't experience loss or fear from their investment. And when loss finally hits, they will be be panicing or it will be too late.

What about the taxation in this scenario where BTC is the only currency in play?
- Farmer sold an egg to a boy for 1 BTC
- Farmer buy lemonade from boy for .5BTC
How much dollars do they exactly pay for their taxes?

Do they have any interest on buying stuff online? (Unfortunately  there's few mainstream online store accepting bitcoins) When I was a kid, I always have to ask my dad for his credit card to order stuff.

Does it work on your desktop browsers? If so, then it's probably Safari 6 blocking third party cookies.

How about offering gift card via Bitcoin/LiteCoin online?
Cryptocurrency is relatively new and no one is prepared to bring their laptop to use it in store. Post some poster saying visit .com to buy GC with your BTC and LTC.
@_date: 2013-06-03 20:13:36
Can switch to mine LTC instead.

I'm suprised PayPal havent freeze BFL yet with all these complains.

Remember, this is just a simple heuristic of detecting potential "danger" levels. What can stop from someone creating 2 popular pools? 
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:03:51
Sounds more like an economic paper with the content you are putting. If you want to add more CS, talk about the crypto behind it.
For general source, source all newspaper and news video(youtube of major new's outlet) article about bitcoin.

So if JP Morgan decides to sue and its patent/stance somehow holds. How will they sue Bitcoin, since no one really owns it.

it's rare but probable. imagine the creator is the only who can be trusted. if he decide to ship out the software via usb, an evil mailman/neighbor can alter the software before it gets to your hand.
this is just an extreme case the producer want to avoid.

Do you always logout immediately after you finish using your mtgox account?
@_date: 2013-09-17 12:32:59
Mind if you can contact the original OP  for more contact info beside his forum contact? I'm in the same boat unable to PM him, since new account cannot do it.
Or you can share the info?

Although it might be free or cheap to the users, it will cost money to the content provider.

I'm open for debates but she didn't really answer anything and every time she opens her mouth she go off-topic and make unconvincing weak statements.

Can one avoid tax directly if the owner spend his bitcoin on goods including giftcard? If so, this is a win-win option.
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:44:08
this is the correct way for bitcoin to grow as a currency :)

If one know they can cause a flash crash(assuming the crash wont be long term or permanent), cant they utilize this power to sell on high and buy on low ?
@_date: 2013-06-03 23:43:28
Yeah it fluctuates. For the past weeks it was usually more profitable to mine LTC. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:18:10
You can imagine a higher level. If he cant afford to buy a necessity in cash, he will use his whatever fund(BTC) he have left. 
If he can afford to pay in fiat but feel like buying via BTC, he can convert his fiat to BTC. 
@_date: 2013-09-13 17:42:24
I'm also surprised some know about it :)
