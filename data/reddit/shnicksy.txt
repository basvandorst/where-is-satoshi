Man I hope not. I was thinking 3 but 1 is definitely possible. I don’t have much now just like .2 but I think I’ll just sit on this and only add a whole one or two if it does go for 1 range

Debating. I think a huge drop is still coming before it really goes up.

Some guy drove a car and then some other guy sat in some room?

Blockchain - no need to pay for a wallet
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:56:07
What were you thinking?
@_date: 2018-06-25 16:29:35
It’s telling us to sell?
@_date: 2018-03-13 20:33:40
Lol these guys are pretty seriously worried about their privacy. Coinbase has been great for me. Coinsquare is my new go to though because you can buy more at once and it’s simple.

There is no such thing as an expert
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:56:53
Blockchain has been easy and great for me
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:30:15
It’s way down right now. Check into it and see how you feel. For me it’s a knockoff of the real deal Bitcoin and I think the inventor, Charlie Lee is an idiot

@_date: 2018-03-04 21:53:10
Too much of a guessing game. Stick with the proven Bitcoin/Ethereum 
@_date: 2018-02-25 01:00:15
Never heard of it
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:51:59
Honestly wouldn’t bother. Bitcoin is the way to go. If anything else, Ethereum. Unless you’re investing $1,000 + I wouldn’t look anywhere else
@_date: 2018-03-12 12:56:40
Need to be flexible. Rural is the way to go. You’ll find it if you want it. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:13:15
I’ve played around with a few of the exchanges. Though the minimum is annoying, Coinbase is better than any others. I wouldn’t waste my time elsewhere given what you are looking to do. Just buy it with them and send it to your wallet (I’d recommend Blockchain) and you’re on your way. You can mess around getting verified on another exchange for if you want to sell years down the road 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:22:59
I feel it. Moving stuff around a bunch. Gold, silver and Bitcoin/Ether/Litecoin. At some point common sense has to come into play no matter how many “analysts” say the economy is strong and the bull market will continue potentially for years

Just needs to go to the moon one time and then it can do whatever the heck it wants to do. Get Daddy rich!!!!!

@_date: 2018-04-09 00:32:34
Jeeeeeeeeeeeesus! That is an incredible find. Thank you. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:46:05
I lost my mind at first too. Check out Coinsquare. It’s straight forward, quick and easy to get verified. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:56:50

Why so shady?
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:00:48
It’s just really, really creepy and weird. Raises questions about the OP
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:32:23
Be creative. Be original.

Absolutely do not invest in anything if you’ve got those kind of stipulations
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:10:54
I absolutely thought you were trolling saying imagine Bitcoin goes to zero today. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:45:47
Why do you think it would include Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:55:08
Well that’s fair! Lol

I don’t think social security was but it may have changed in the last year 
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:11:51
We went off track. My original post was to the buddy who needed to buy without ID. Check out his profile. Shady as hell. Someone like that shouldn’t be allowed to be sneaking around. That’s why there are laws. But then you started acting even shadier so I’m curious why you are so paranoid? Or are you just a hardcore Bitcoin bible thumper?
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:54:29
Yep he’s thumpin lol
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:23:15
Oh wow lol
@_date: 2018-04-05 22:49:20
Only way to out do the original post and you did it. You have to live as you. Damn
