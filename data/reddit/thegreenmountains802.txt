well you just let us know you have no idea why people post r/murderedbywords ill give you a hint its not a critique on analogy's, and its when some one rips another person apart for being an idiot. but why expect a dolt like you to pick up on a super easy concept... click on the sub and you'll get an idea
i feel like I'm taking crazy pills and the amount of retards in this thread are surprisingly high 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:52:24

@_date: 2018-04-24 21:03:34
im amazed at how little critical thinking some people can have
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:08:52
notice how its you with the downvotes? that's because you're the  simpleton and not picking up on a simple concept.
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:38:41

im actually working with my Lawyer right now on getting him for fraud for selling me BCH when he advertised bitcoin.. the law looks pretty fucking clear to. I hope many more do this also just to fuck him and show you can fraud people. i want to make a point regulations or not you cant fraud people Roger Ver
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:32:02
yes this is fraud and I'v already talked to my lawyer... this is 100% fraud in america. I'm going to see what I can do to sue him. You cant tell me you selling me bitcoin then sell me Bcash.. regulations or not thats called fraud!
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:29:43
right but what they are doing here is called fraud and illegal
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:22:50
high enough to see no one agreed with you and everyone thinks your a dolt
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:19:48
Fuck off trump lies more then any person i have ever seen in my fucking life, and its over shit that's provable in seconds and no reason to lie about. He cant help him self that's what narcissism does to the human mind.

its not about regulation its illegal to deceive the person into thinking they are buying a different product then the one you are selling.
also the fact that cryptos are taxed the way they are shows the SEC would very much care about this.
@_date: 2018-04-24 21:44:07
if you did it with the intent of making me think i was buying a sandwich and knew the whole time you would be selling me a hot dog then yes that is fraud... its a frivolous fraud that wouldn't go to court but by definition that is also fraud. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:23:48
being upset is ok... but literally defrauding people because of it is not... it doesn't matter what you believe is better this is 100% fraud and should be an easy case.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:43:23
let me break this down for you a little more... think... who holds the patent on the fucking tomato? that's right no body but if I tell you I'm selling you 400 tomatoes and then send you 400 onions that's not allowed. But if I used the name tomatoes to list my onions with the intent of making you think you would receive tomatoes knowing i will send you something that is not tomatoes that's called fraud.
its not about regulation its illegal to deceive the person into thinking they are buying a different product then you are selling.

doesn't matter whats better or not hes fucking deceiving people into buying his shit coin by telling them its bitcoin... this is fraud and I'm actually going to go buy some "bitcoin" on his sight so I can sue him when he sells me bitcoins instead.. regulated or not fraud is fraud. and its time for me to put some money to use.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:56:34
your wrong.. this pic is centralization of bitcoin... one dude Roger Ver has enough power that he can do this stuff to manipulate the whole of bitcoin its self an project his power to make people think bitcoincash is bitcoin the real bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:33:50
no... no it isnt, I dont give a shit if you think its better or not but its not the real bitcoin, bitcoin is the real bitcoin. And after talking to my lawyer I'm going on to Rogers site to buy what he is selling as bitcoin and when he sells me bcash instead of Bitcoin like he advertised I'm going to sue him for fraud. the US laws are clear on this and its 100% fraud to tell people you are selling them bitcoin and sell them a different crypto. it doesn't matter what regulations are in the industry but fraud is fraud.

lol wut? Patents have nothing to do with this.. let me break this down for you a little more... think... who holds the patent on the fucking tomato? that's right no body but if I tell you I'm selling you 400 tomatoes and then send you 400 onions that's not allowed. But if I used the name tomatoes to list my onions with the intent of making you think you would receive tomatoes knowing i will send you something that is not tomatoes that's called fraud.

also you're an idiot... lets use chairs then. I cant advertise that i'm selling chairs and when you order chairs I send you tables instead knowing the whole time that I called them chairs with the goal of getting you to think you were buying a chair and not a table. There is no patent on the chair and its not a regulated product yet that is still fraud. do i need to dumb it down more for you bud? Because Im tired of breaking this simple concept down for a dolt on my phone.
