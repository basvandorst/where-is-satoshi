Won me over. Good luck tomorrow, I'm hoping you and your team can save bitcoin.

What coins are you using now?

So are you saying that bitcoin core supporters want bitcoin to be used as an investment while bcash supporters want bcash to be used as a viable currency?
Is bitcoin's current best use a store of wealth / investment? I don't see it being a good way to make payments, send money, or be used as a currency because of the current transaction times and fees. The lightning upgrade seems to be a long way away too.
I don't like Roger Ver from what I've heard about him, but I have to ask what is bitcoin really good for these days? I'm not trying to stir up FUD, but some intelligent, open discussion would be great.

You're just jelly because you'll NEVER own and roll in a sweet pair of heelys. NEVER EVER IN YOUR LIFE!
Go ahead and try to prove me wrong.

You do you homie. Enjoy your heelys and fuck the salty haters who wish they could

What's your relation to Tony Stark?

Solid answer, thank you.

Which wallets do you recommend that let you set custom fees? Are we talking mobile or PC?

Roger sucks, but there is always more than 1 reason for anything including price drops. Bitcoin is unusable right now while mainstream attention is growing. We can only hope lightning gets implemented before the public realizes how broken Bitcoin is

I honestly have bitcoin but no bitcoin cash because I joined late. Can someone please explain to me how current bitcoin is better/more usable than bcash? It seems to me that bcash is currently faster and cheaper to use, but I may be mistaken.

If your shipping and handling fees is a large percentage or higher than the cost of the product, why do you do it?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:32:06
You are right there is nothing wrong with charging high fees for services if people are willing to pay for them. What I don't understand is why companies such as factom would use Bitcoin with its current fees and times rather than anything else.
My point is that Bitcoin is gaining more mainstream attention and more new users. What do you believe is Bitcoin's best use case for these newcomers?
Due to current fees and transaction times, Bitcoin is not feasible as currency to be used at retail or sending payments to friends or family. So what is Bitcoin's best use for average Joes and newcomers? It's starting to look like it's a good vehicle for speculation

A source for my anecdote? Nope, was this meant for the poster above?

I haven't been to Taiwan yet, but I've been all over China, including Shanghai and Beijing and almost no one speaks English at all in the general population. The colleagues I had to work with, definitely did not have better English than many Americans.

I feel pretty tired about these Venezuela posts. Everyone in Venezuela right now would prefer to have USD over Bitcoin right now!
Almost no one in Venezuela can use bitcoin right now, they want USD. Why is crypto propaganda using Venezuela as a case study? Its demonstrating USD being more accepted/usable than bitcoin!

In all honesty, which is more usable and accepted in Venezuela right now: Bitcoin or USD?
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:59:56
So why would anyone in Venezuela want Bitcoin over USD right now?

I believe you are mistaken, btc and bch run on different networks

Are you aware of how laws and politics work? Of course they wouldn't try to pass a law to jail all bitcoin owners. 
But they would definitely pass a law generic and vague enough to give them the power to fight growing cryptocurrencies to protect the us dollar. This is that

If I use paper wallets, am I technically using block chain.info?
