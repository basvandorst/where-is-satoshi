Even if we all agree taxation is theft, what's the alternative?  A completely voluntary system?  I can't help but be very skeptical that would work, even for a minimalist government that only consists of military, police, firefighters, and courts.  People are loathe to pay taxes as it is, now you tell them "You don't have to pay, but it would be nice for the country if you did."

Well said, it's not you can't invest in both crypto and passive index funds.

Not surprising, though isn't Vanguard planning to use blockchain to improve their index tracking?

I'm curious, what's the purpose of moving your coins from GDAX to Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:05:48
While I can see why they'd take their chances with Bitcoin over Bolivar, why is it a better option than converting to USD?  Yes, there's inflation like with any fiat but it's at a steady 2-3% a year.  Bitcoin could crash 50% in a few days, 20% in a few hours and no matter how bullish you feel about Bitcoin longterm I don't think you'd want that kind of short term volatility if you can barely afford food.  Also, wouldn't dollars be a lot more widely accepted in the country?

True, but I'd argue there's a difference between spending dollars on pizza and being totally unaware of Bitcoin's existence like most people were back in 2011 and actually having Bitcoin in 2011 and spending it on pizza.  With that being said, "If only I'd kept my Bitcoin" regrets are silly when I doubt even its biggest proponents in 2011 were predicting this explosion in 2017 would happen.  Everyone's a genius and everything's obvious in hindsight.

Ugh, it's been a week since I transferred bitcoin from GDAX to Gatehub.  Emailed support and got an automated reply saying that in rare cases transfers can take a few hours.  Well, that's not very reassuring.

Big Bang Theory recently had an episode featuring Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:40:32
I should've clarified, my capital losses are in stocks and bonds.  My gains are in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:48:03
I'm only transferring some bitcoin to Gatehub because I wanna buy some XRP with it and XRP's not available on GDAX.  As someone who doesn't know much about trading GDAX wasn't that hard to figure out.  I think avoiding Coinbase's 1.49% fees (each time you buy AND sell!) is worth the extra hassle of learning about how limit orders work, but if you don't then I'd just stick with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:19:45
I'm guessing support hasn't been any help.  Do they ever do more than automated replies?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:55:54
Hey, thanks for mentioning the Delta app. It's exactly what I've been looking for in terms of tracking and tax purposes.

Fair enough, you could be right that there are more people who could give you an in depth explanation about WoW than bitcoin.  But I was talking about simple recognition, not active engagement.  I still think there are more people who have heard of bitcoin but have never bought it and don't know anything about it, vs those who have heard of WoW but have never played it and don't know anything about it.  I admit this is just a hunch, nothing more.
I'm curious, surely there are some more objective sources?  Like public polls, google search trends, etc?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:51:38
While he's saying it in a douchy way I don't think he's wrong (that if $100 is a significant amount of money that would cause you considerable pain if you lost it, then you shouldn't invest it in bitcoin, or any single investment for that matter).

What would be an example of giving away interest in a non-charitable way?

This makes me curious about how Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, etc access their billions in stock. I'm assuming it's way more elaborate than a simple username/password.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:37:22
That may be true, but South Park has done plenty of episodes on niche topics, for example World of Warcraft and Magic the Gathering.  I'd say bitcoin is far more recognized by the general public than WoW and MtG ever were.

As someone who sold at 15k worried about the futures market this hurts.  Lesson learned - HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:03:02
Holy shit, bitcoin was only $1-30 throughout 2011.  If you don't mind me asking, how many did you mine and are you still holding them?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:42:39
Is it a valid concern that Ripple owns over 60% of XRP and could seriously devalue XRP if it started selling a big chunk?  This is a common reason I've heard people give for not buying.

I'm curious, what do Muslims in the US do regarding loans and savings accounts?  I assume it's also not allowed to receive interest.

So what's the best thing to do if Charlie got criticized for selling all his LTC while Vitalik gets criticized for holding his ETH?  Seems like a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation.

Does Bitcoin tend to thrive during periods of unrest for traditional assets, like what is going on now with new tariffs, devaluing of the yuan, markets having a really bad past few days, etc?

How recent was this?  I sent coins from coinbase to nano s without any fees a few weeks ago.

"Ps never tell anyone how much crypto you have!"
Why is this common advice for crypto but not traditional investments like ETFs, stocks, options, etc?  If you go to other investing forums you'll see people posting screenshots of their exact positions all the time, revealing their brokerage as well.
@_date: 2019-04-18 16:33:16
Thanks, that makes sense.  Would you say that's the double edged sword of decentralization (more freedom and accessibility but less security)?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:55:30
But are there actually examples of governments that were/are completely voluntarily by their citizens?  Even 1800s America had tariffs, which citizens indirectly had to pay for through increased prices in goods.  You may argue that's not as bad as an income tax, but it's still coercive.
