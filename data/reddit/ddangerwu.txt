hey all, I made a short vid about the analogy that Andreas M. Antonopoulos uses for describing different actors in crypto. My goal is to spread crypto to more people who have  heard about it but is discouraged by the technicalities. Hopefully my videos can bring knowledge to the general public. please give me any feedback!
