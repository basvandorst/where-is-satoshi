Kraken, Kraken customer support SCAM! Kraken SCAM! Kraken customer support phone number's are all scammers. They stole $40,000 from me!!! San Fransisco California
*Author of original report: Kraken crypto bitcoin EXCHANGE SCAM!
Ripoff Report
on the Internet.
I used Kraken for trading Bitcoin and built $7,000 into over $20,000 over a few months. When I tried to withdraw funds and move money I was scammed by their employees, them and possible ex employee scammers. 
This is a company that supposedly made billions last year with a captiol B. They get you frustrated by having no phone support at all and denying every bank wire request and any other type of request to withdraw you're money.
I finally googled "Kraken customer support phone number" There are at least 10 800's.
They said they could help me and got into my account and immediatly moved all my bitcoin to them then bought more bitcoin with my money and transferred it to them. 
Kraken said sorry they could not help me. REALLY!! "Sorry but someone has gained access to your account without your permission" This is what they told me. 
So your platform got compromised and you say "sorry" and not restore it. 
 
This company already got hacked in 2015 and they do not care. 
DO NOT PUT YOUR MONEY WITH THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. IT IS A GREAT RISK. THEY STOLE OVER $40,000 FROM ME. THEY ARE A SCAM!! PLEASE TAKE THIS WARNING AND DON'T LOSE YOUR SAVING OR RETIREMENT OR ANYTHING FOR THAT MATTER. 
 
Please spread the word about this scam and this rip-off company.
