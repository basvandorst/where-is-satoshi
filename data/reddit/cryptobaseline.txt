@_date: 2016-08-02 23:07:53
they'll go through liquidation. they are out of control now.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:17:21
So let's hurt the bitcoin network because "bitfinex".
The best solution here is to create a non-reversible blockchain in what-ever situation. Reversing the blockchain should be always impossible.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:33:22
no you can't now.
@_date: 2016-08-31 21:24:52
we need 3 gavin confirmations 
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:55:02
No. I used to think they are the best regulated wallet out there until I had a serious incident: Their wallet generated a wrong address.
I had to wait for 3 months to get refunded (the amount was small, wonder if it was bigger) and did go by multiple social media sites to grab their attention.
They are, indeed, one of the worst bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:02:35
I'd be more worried in accessing any funds actually.
@_date: 2016-08-20 22:40:53
whats your site?
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:52:12
how are you going to refund users? USDs? ETHs? Did you buy the 191k back?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:15:17
hmm unless the price moves 20-30%. I bought on margin @ $600.
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:56:38
when can I withdraw for fuck sake?
@_date: 2016-08-17 12:34:10
That's not really my question. If the history of the transactions is not saved/verified; how do we know if the blockchain is not compromised?
@_date: 2016-08-17 11:39:34

I lost a good amount (at least for me. more than 10btc) on this saga. I'm interested in any collaborative effort that takes Bitfinex to bankruptcy. Please ping me if you are creating such a group or need help in forming one.
@_date: 2016-08-17 10:14:40


That seems to only care about the total number of bitcoins in existence. How do we know that the transaction was spent by its real owner?
@_date: 2016-08-26 12:06:25
This is the worst bitcoin explanation so far.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:43:44

I have 14btc as I'm trading though.

@_date: 2016-08-06 18:06:22
This is bullshit. I want numbers. How in hell generalizing the loss across all assets will net a 36% haircut? Did they lose all of their BTCs?
Basically, they have BTC/USD/LTC/ETH. 36% seems really like the max of what they should have in BTC.
So Zane, you lost all of your BTC, huh?

@_date: 2015-12-12 03:02:41
Good thing about coinbase is that you can link it to a wallet. You can put a small amount in that wallet (say $500) so that even if something goes wrong you don't lose your coins.
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:04:27

I'm not worried about "MyTrezor" tracking. I might be using the Trezor to handle transactions but not to store bitcoins.

No it's not. 
Please stop propagating wrong data. Bitfinex has much more volume than these two combined and that's not counting the chinese exchanges.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:40:01
If you've been following, you'll know it's not the perfect capacity. Some chinese miners have been voicing concerns with 1MB blocks on the HK conference.

I'm interested on this too. Please keep us update and provide more details.
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:20:39
Proof or it didn't happen. Personally, I don't believe that someone who got into bitcoin because of drugs, will leave bitcoin after the silkroad. he'll probably look for other similar markets. And given the exposure bitcoin got when it went to $1,000 a piece, it's very unlikely he didn't hear about it.
calling bs on this.
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:08:14
I did speak with one of the co-founders. They are planning to be a "consulting" company. Look, for example, at WordPress. They have an open source product but they are a billion dollar company. Redhat is another example too.
So, yes, anybody can do WordPress Dev/Services. But they have an edge since they built the product. But the point is, they are building an open system.

We don't celebrate Xmas here. So it was really accidental!
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:37:50
Why do we need 8Mb now? We are doing "just" fine with 1Megabyte. Also, the last conference has showed that increasing the block size is not the ultimate solution. Seg Witnesses, ILBT, Lightening, Sidechains.. there are many ways to make bitcoin scale than changing a number.
@_date: 2015-12-23 16:13:30
I agree. I'd like that blockstream get lightening up and running but I don't agree that they have special integration within Core. This is like Coinbase having special treatment because they just labelled themselves "Open Source". But we are still a lot away from that. Wait and See.
@_date: 2015-12-11 10:08:26
I'm happy they don't.
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:22:19
I just bought it to see if it can be useful. If you want to cold store bitcoins, nothing beat a very simple setup: Brainwallet on an air-gapped machine + pre-created tx to your trezor or coinbase account. The txs can be safely stored in emails, dropbox, etc.. unencrypted. You have instant access to your coins + the safety of basic setup.
Here is the long version: 
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:10:04
I mean it could be possible. If you have time and coding skills, you can hack a chrome extension for it!
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:59:42


How'd that work?
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:26:11
The software update was as easy as clicking on the trezor buttons. I don't think you can predict 2-3 years to come in bitcoin land. Let alone 10 years.
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:28:58
I'm not going to use for cold storage. I just bought it to try it out.
@_date: 2015-12-20 15:22:17
But it's SUNDAY!
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:57:59
given that 70% of bitcoins are mined, holders are more influential than miners. They can move the price anywhere they want.
@_date: 2015-12-19 19:37:46
Just curious to know. How many BTC did you receive before they started asking questions? 1, 10, 100, 1000?

If you have lots of BTC and need a fail-proof solution, here is mine: 
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:05:58
it's not a civil right to use coinbase. Most sites have a license that grant them kicking your ass any time and WITHOUT a specified reason. I'm only worried about access to the funds.
@_date: 2015-12-11 02:07:36
No the difficulty rise because the hash rate rise (not the price).
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:25:15
I ordered it the day before yesterday. I'm in North-Africa, so it was quick. It went through Germany and France before getting here.
@_date: 2015-12-20 10:46:06
Why not? Bitcoiners giving full control of bitcoins to coinbase means that they have delegated "full control" to them and thus they are eligible to vote on their behalf. I have a coinbase account and I think it's reasonable if coinbase would vote on my behalf.

@_date: 2015-12-03 10:20:56
You are here assuming that "holders" are in favour of BIP101. I'm not, and I'm probably holding much more than the average "holder" and long time investor.
You'll need to backup your claims with what users/holders want. 
So far exchanges/wallets want BIP101
Miners want BIP100
Personally, I want a solution that makes both miners and exchanges happy, keep transactions low fee as they are now (or lower), and is merged in the main/single bitcoin core (not a la bitcoin xt)
@_date: 2015-12-22 17:18:44
@ I had a short talk with Mark on the Scaling Bitcoin conference. The technology they are building is open source. He said they think they'll monetize it through consulting. My guess is that the number of people who will make money out of lightening (if it worked) and the money they'll make is probably much more than what Blockstream will make from "consulting".
Mark is trying to honestly (imo) move bitcoin forward. He has a vision and he is working on it. ( let me know if I'm wrong somewhere ). He thinks bitcoin can't scale on the main chain given how difficult it is to support hundreds of millions of txs/day with the current tech.
He thinks (and said) that companies like Coinbase shouldn't exist. It makes sense if bitcoin becomes a settlement layer. You need a wallet to put "money/currency" and not "blockchain settlement tokens".
He wants to get Lightening working to make his vision come true. The problem, I guess, is that this conflicts with guys like Coinbase and people who want to scale on the main chain so that they can run their businesses too.
Mark is winning (imo) for two reasons: 1. His tech doesn't require a hard fork or controversial changes. Just some OP_Codes and soft-fork changes to Bitcoin Core. 2. His tech won't scale "on bitcoin". It scales "off bitcoin". So once he gets the changes on Bitcoin core, he can start deploying his tech (lightening, sidechains).
Following that logic, a block size increase is not in the best interest of Mark. It'd help to have 1. higher fees on the mainchain and 2. more decentralization to make Lightening a good medium for making transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-26 21:00:58
I'm not sure I understand your question. Trezor and paper wallets are not the same thing.
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:38:35
How do you know that? It's possible that current owners don't sell their BTC even at $10K and there is a shortage of supply. It's really complicated to measure such a thing.
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:36:56
They want bigger blocks. Everybody does. But they want to make sure that they can propagate and handle them.
@_date: 2017-02-26 14:25:42
what does it take to make a bitcoin core version (git fork) that has seg wit activated by default?
@_date: 2017-02-26 23:19:36

@_date: 2017-02-22 00:59:11
you should look at the bring side of it: reducing utxo!

use an "entropied" enough passphrase?
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:51:14
its segwit but instead of having the witness (signature) out of the blockchain he is taking the whole tx out. been wondering why core didnt do that in the first place.
@_date: 2016-03-27 23:17:09
1. POS doesn't stop inflation.
2. POS is still not released yet and not guaranteed to work.
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:10:17
They are not spending much :D Cheap guys!
@_date: 2016-03-11 16:32:59
The network can support 250k txs with 0.05$ fee just fine. The recent attacks have showed that. Currently, the network is processing 180k txs/day. So we have enough room for growth.
Once Seg.Wit is widely deployed, we'll have a capacity of around 400k tx / day. It'll require bitcoin usage to more than double in order to reach number. This is quite possible but remember that tx fees are still $0.05 only.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:17:16
you didn't answer my question. what protections do you have against chargebacks? (I guess this is why no one wants to trade bitcoin for PayPal).
@_date: 2016-03-26 09:11:37
0.66$ in fees only. Which means you can re-construct all these input and still have 2.7$
( price for two txs)
@_date: 2016-01-31 15:02:13
is this an interview question? Why are you asking this?
@_date: 2016-03-09 20:28:54
I actually suspect the other way around. Coinbase used to do lots of mixing and "partitioning of coins". Now they are probably using any inputs they have to create a couple outputs. They are more efficient. You didn't notice that before because they prepare inputs beforehand.
However, this shows how expensive it is for coinbase to provide such a service for "free". If it costs them $0.5/tx and they handle 5k txs a day, that's $2.5k for txs alone. A raising tx cost will mean much higher fee for them and eventually no way they can provide this service for free anymore killing one of their advantages.
That's probably why coinbase, circle and xapo are pushing aggressively for lower fees and bigger block size.
@_date: 2016-03-08 07:40:28
Raised most capital? 21inc
Has more users? blockchain.info
Largest volume? Bitfinex
Best product? Not sure about this. But it is not coinbase, they might have the best interface though.
@_date: 2016-03-08 09:15:37
Same happened to me. Never used them again.
PS: They don't alert you about the limit until you try to send. Good luck!
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:21:04
This is bullshit. Coinbase had a bug that LOST me money and they still don't answer support...
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:38:00
Coinbase benefits from centralization. If you can't run a full-node (or even SPV), you'll need to use a third-party service (a la coinbase) to make transactions happen.
Coinbase wants bitcoin to grow B2B. Fullnodes will be in massive datacenters.
Blockstream wants bitcoin to grow P2P. Full nodes still can be run by users.
@_date: 2016-03-22 22:41:19
whats the tx?
@_date: 2016-03-22 12:01:57
i see. so it's not really bitcoin to paypal but more mastercard to paypal.
any plans to support Tunisia? I'm looking to get one.
@_date: 2017-02-13 10:16:10


So... are you telling me you have a good chance this saturday evening?
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:00:30
How are you going to handle chargebacks?
@_date: 2016-01-29 06:56:06


Can you back up your claim?
@_date: 2016-03-22 14:06:14
I meant it's not like sending PayPal money to someone. You are withdrawing to your card. You can already do that with Advcash.
Get in touch with me if you need any help regarding Tunisian authorities.
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:03:28
your fee is low. Your tx has lots of inputs.
@_date: 2016-01-30 08:42:32
Sure but right now miners makes 95% of their profit from block reward, not from fees. So they are fine sticking with a 1MB (or even empty) block.
@_date: 2016-03-29 22:29:38
-1. I use bitcoin for domains, email (fast mail), hosting, vpn, backup service, donations.
I never used it to buy drugs, but that's because I don't do drugs.

Here are a couple things I don't like in this blog post (and why I don't respect the guy anymore):
1. He is attacking some core devs. By saying that some core devs don't want on-chain scaling, he is attacking them imo. Core devs did huge work for bitcoin and they are far from evil.
2. He thinks everybody else is wrong, and he is right. Well, this is possible with the general populace. But we are talking here about other experimented core devs. eg. he says 75% is the right trigger while everybody is pushing for 95% and goes on to explain why 75% is right despite no clear evidence of that
@_date: 2016-03-09 08:50:13
I don't think so. Their exchange volume is now 1k+ bitcoin a day. Still not huge but much better than the few hundreds it used to do. It improved a LOT. Don't forget that it is only accessible to some US states and not world-wide.
Today it "volumed" around 1,800 which is around 1/3 of coinbase volume. If it carries its slow and consistent growth it'll be a top exchange before 2017.
@_date: 2016-03-08 08:19:56
something I learned recently: it takes 2 hours for ETH confirmation of deposit. Too much for the 10sec blocks!
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:09:48
Stop the BS. You are doing a 1 year only timeframe. Here is the full timeframe: 
Fees were more expensives in USD despite the number of tx being much less than today's
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:01:59
Here is a transaction I just made and it was included in the exact next block.
Hint to the guy doing the stress test (because I hate the phrase "spam txs"): Next time use high fees to see how this plays out.
@_date: 2016-03-09 11:45:11
this is wrong comparison. you should compare gemini to USD exchanges volumes and I don't count chinese volumes. coinbase in that regard will be the third most-volumed exchange.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:26:54
developer centralization? what the fuck does that mean?

I don't agree with Luke. I also think he is the wrong person to lead an open source project especially like bitcoin. But that doesn't discount his huge contributions to the bitcoin project.

@_date: 2016-01-24 14:44:41
So we need a BTC vote. People sign with their BTC and vote. Miners, Developers, Companies should, sorry, MUST do what holders say.
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:30:20
This is why I think Core is the most competent team to lead bitcoin. There is a lot of room for growth technically. It's better that fees raises, txs get stuck for a few months and maybe a year than launch a half-assed operation that messes things even more.
Bitcoin Core need a Community Manager and a *competent* PR team.
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:19:24
Users can setup a copay or mycelium wallet and get started easily with bitcoin. Coinbase offer a valuable service but without centralization they can be disrupted very easily and will have a hard time holding any btc assets.
coinbase covers the tx fees for now. But that won't probably last forever.
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:37:34
This is bullshit. We are @ 9k txs in the mempool now. The attack was not even solid enough (low fees and short period of time)

It's about the governance of bitcoin development. Brian and Gavin and Jeff wants to take the gov. of bitcoin core from the core developers (majority).
Since they are the minority (3 devs if you count Hearn who left), they tried to make people think that people should also have a say in the development process.
People should not have any opinion on the development process. The supply of bitcoin? yes, certainly. But not technical details.
I remember one time, a person (women but who cares) suggested to put a red light in the middle of a highway so that people can activate it and cross the highway.
Imagine giving people the power to take such decisions.
Why would we have specialist anyway then. Let's also blockchain the bitcoin client.

very hard to know since:
1. one person can have more than one address.
2. one person can have circle, coinbase, blockchain... accounts
3. an address might belong to an exchange which bitcoins might belong to thousands of users.

@_date: 2016-06-18 18:03:19
I tried it and here is my opinion:
1. It's not as safe as promoted. The keys are generated on the browser. If it is compromised, you are already compromised before you even started. So their security can never beat a Hardware wallet like Trezor.
2. They say they hold an encrypted version of your key, and decrypt it on the browser. You have to TRUST them for doing what they say they do. Might as well hold your coins on the regular vault if you are doing so.
3. I once had a problem with the multi-sign vault. It generated a wrong address and I sent money that never got there. I was refunded months later by the coinbase support team. But again, it's not as secure as you think it is and you might still have to deal with the coinbase support. (and write reddit posts to get their attention).
TL;DR: Get a fucking trezor.

unless all outputs are lost that won't happen. you can divide almost indefinitely and instead of having 0.00006btc, maybe use 60satoshis and millisatoshis and then we have microsatoshi as a new unit (call it usc) and divide that again.

or here is an idea:
you have an email address (or collection of email addresses) and everytime you receive an email, you get an amount of Bitcoins (let's say 0.000001) to your address. Obviously, this should run on lightening.
Then you use the proceeds to send emails. To get started, you deposit $5 or something like that, which gets you 5,000 emails to send.
This cut SPAM. For newsletters, you need to approve these email senders by adding their BTC address (or public key) to your whitelist.

I can see this being supper useful in determining the amount of "active" capital in bitcoin. Though a long-term holder can shuffle money around with no intention to sell, but this is not a frequent behavior.

Miners should start to charge for UTXO. If you are sending small change to an output, you should pay higher fees. If you are assembling lots of inputs into a single output, you should get a fee reduction.
Miners are only thinking about the short-term if they charge for fee/kb.

This, with pruning, can make full nodes possible again. You basically start an SPV node; and sync as much as you can. Maybe it'll take a whole year (you cap it), but at the end you are working toward decentralizations.

I have thought about something similar but that would require a trust from a miner/several miners: You can use Hashes and verify the data hashed. However, once you broadcast the transaction, anybody can spend your transaction.
So you'll need a miner to include it for you, and trust him to do so.
Maybe this can come up with a special/increased fee. For example, a service that enables to connect people who wants to do these transactions with honest miners. Users will pay higher transactions fees (say 10-20$ instead of a few cents)

@_date: 2016-11-17 13:23:02
The butthurt is very strong on this one.
Many companies were/are doomed because bitcoin didn't have the illusionary big bubble they thought it would. Companies like Coinbase and Circle spent lots of money that they'll never get back.
Let's take circle. They took $136m in venture capital to create a very simple and basic wallet with a Buy/Sell option (banks/credit cards).
Heck, they are not even in the business of supporting everyone with their credit cards (mine didn't work there). They also, certainly, have a "few" million users. Coinbase only has 4.8million.
When bitcoin didn't payout; and in the case of these companies it needs to go to 500million users and 2trillion$ market cap so that they can payout their investors billions of $ of exit money; they simply started to pivot.
These companies are very toxic to bitcoin right now. They are trying to pivot and some of them are trying to pivot bitcoin at the expense of risking privacy, decentralization and stability.

That might have some truth to it. But rest assured, the other camp is more VC powered than blockstream. Coinbase (and other walllets) are leading it. A big block size will prevent people from running a full node and will make using bitcoin more painful.
What's more useful to the average bitcoin user? A better full-node wallet that gives him control OR giving control of his bitcoins to a third-party service a la coinbase.
There is a conflict of interest here. Mainly between blockstream and coinbase.
I'll pick blockstream any time of the day.
@_date: 2016-02-20 21:01:08

Simple. Because Gavin can't get wide consensus. At first, they claimed that most users want this change. Turned out that most devs are against them, the miners are not guaranteed to change and users are likely not on their side too.
Their next attempt will be to fork at 51%

you can do it on multiple smaller txs.
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:31:05
Think about it for a second:
Coinbase is building a closed product company. Their success depends on the number of users, not the success of bitcoin. If coinbase has 100million users, they can switch to their own crypto and kick bitcoin forever. Or maybe make a crypto between the big X companies and bank: Circle, Coinbase, Xapo, Bitpay... Coinbase want to scale fast at the EXPENSE of bitcoin to grow, as a company.
Blockstream is building an open source product. Their success, as a company, depends on the success of their product. The success of their product will result in the success of bitcoin, as it is built on top of it.

imo the number of nodes speak best to the classic coup case.
If classic was legit, then we'll see classic node numbers replace core numbers.

The chart clearly shows that classic nodes are new to the network. Anybody who didn't believe this is a coup until now has stupidly clear evidence in front of him.

1. if you add a passphrase, your seed is at least as good as your passphrase.

That doesn't address my question which is: Could the P2SH soft-fork have provoked a fork on the network is there was a minority of miners mining on a chain that doesn't support P2SH?

okay, according to coinmap:

That's 16% yearly growth. So yes, it has really stalled (or it's not booming as of now)
@_date: 2016-09-24 08:44:14
I don't think it matters. Different companies/groups will use different solutions. For example, I imagine in the future, exchanges and wallets might collide to use a Payment channel specific to them. Wallets then might use another payment channel with Bitpay for example, etc... So an online wallet will manage these payment channels for you.
And maybe you'll use a "Major" payment channel that connects you to other payment channels.
@_date: 2016-09-23 17:37:44
Were a split (fork) possible on the previous hard-fork (the P2SH one for example)?
@_date: 2016-09-23 12:48:10


Doesn't this make SegWit a hardfork instead of a softfork. Since if a minority miners mine a non-valid post-SegWit block (but valid pre-SegWit), they'll essentially fork from the network?

This is a giant slap in the face to the unlimited/classic team. Also holding a 5-7% hash rate is dangerous for them since they can get forked out of the chain. I suspect this will push more miners to leave them.
@_date: 2015-11-10 21:26:19
maybe I didn't explain myself better. Bitcoin is better if we don't increase the block size. If we want to handle 1billion transactions daily, that will take 4Gb per block I guess. which is not practical.
But given that we don't have a ready solution now, and the number of transactions is increasing, it might be wise to increase the size of the block to handle the current load.

This doesn't look like a professional answer for a potential customer. But I have a few remarks:
1. You mentioned that there is no AML/KYC for small amounts. So do debit cards. I use advcash and they have $2500 with no verification required.
2. There is something called "virtual credit card". It's very easy to get with advcash. again, no verification required.
Now here are my questions:
1. Should I wait in the store for confirmations? If not, how do you mitigate the risk of double spend?
2. A part from the "decentralized" exchange, how different is it (from a customer perspective) to the competitor I mentioned.
@_date: 2016-10-04 17:16:52
megaupload had like $200m of income at its peak. So it's valuation (at that TIME) was probably in the $1bn+. $100 seems spot on for me.
@_date: 2015-11-29 06:41:18


Exactly. Bitcoin transactions can be easily double spent with a simple script like coinb.in. Now. IMO, RBF should be enabled by default. People must know that transactions are not final until they hit the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:07:13
I know I might come as an asshat. But your whole argument is useless. This is not what I signed up for. People who are holding BTC, are holding it mainly for the 21million cap.
So no. This can't be changed. And if there is a technical problem that requires a fix, it shouldn't be modifying the total cap.
@_date: 2015-11-29 06:38:47
Bitcoin transactions are double-spent with this Core patch or without. I really think RBF should be their by default. Bitcoin transaction should be considered final only if they hit the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-10-21 17:32:34

I was on a plane when the Malaysian (if I recall correctly) plane crashed. I heard the news on the plane. When we landed (3-4 hours later) in Dubai, we got newspapers while we exited the plane.

Lots of criticism for what 21co is offering. I think you guys don't get the idea.
1. Bank wants an employee to get started and experiment on the blockchain. Employee cost $150k per year. That's around $500/day. If the 21co save him one day of work, then it already paid for its price and made a profit of $200.
2. You are a specialized crypto contractor that charges $200/hour. 21co saves you 4hours of work. It already paid for it and and made more profit.
3. You are a broke guy and your account balance has $500. 21co doesn't make sense, but you are not on their target market. And that's fine.

The USA is not representative of the average gov. in this world. Neither is the UK. They are financial centres and world powers.

Hi Luke, since you answered my question, I want to challenge your opinion.
I know that you are not censoring these guys because they are on the gambling industry but because they are doing LOTS of small transactions.
But here is the point. Do you want Bitcoin to be for everyone, or just for your own point of view? Bitcoin for everyone means that everyone sees bitcoin as he thinks it suits his needs. This means I see it as a store of value. Someone sees it as speculation. Someone else as money laundering.
The developers should not have an opinion on that. They should provide the tool. The miners pick what to filter, and the user pick how to reward these miners on their efforts.
So as a developer you should stay as unbiased as possible. Let the miners add spam filtering themselves.

@_date: 2015-11-09 13:00:10
Okay, here is my opinion (feedback and critics welcome):
1. I think the block size should not be bigger. However, I agree that we raise it to 2MB or 4MB so that people using bitcoins don't get large delays or higher fees.
2. Sidechains/Lightening Networks/Bitcoin NG. I think this is the right path to scaling bitcoins. Maybe multiple solutions built on top of bitcoin? Then each company (like Coinbase or Xapo) can chose on which stack to operate.
3. Side-altcurrencies. Why is this a bad idea? Why not have altcoins pegged to bitcoin. IMO, it'll help keep the network decentralized and encourage small miners.
@_date: 2016-05-09 09:13:29
They are pretty safe if you know what you are doing.
Here is an experiment that I did to see how close are brain wallet miners to hacking my brain wallet
The first transaction is a single word (5 characters) and got eaten almost immediately.
The second transaction is the same word plus a number (6 chars). Took a few months.
The third transaction adds a single char. It's still there :)
So I'm not here suggesting you do a 7 char brain wallet. But a lengthy one that has enough random factors (few words + separation chars + your email + your bank account or tax id number) will be impossible to crack.
I was holding over 100BTC for several months in a brainwallet before I got my trezor.
