if you believe in cryptos, yes, exchange at least some of your fiat money into some good cryptos.
I am glad for any real money i still get for my fiat trash.
The US Dollar might crash (even further) under Trumps stupidity and all fiats with it. Fear that, sceptics ;)

really hope you are right, for all the people arround the world who live on usd, but i just cant imagine the usa solving any problems in the coming years, since they first need to get this crossbreed, between dagobert duck and the pig from the simpsons movie, out of the white house again, then they need to fix their democracy, education, health care.. plenty to-dos on the list, before they could do anything for me in europe ;)

if you would understand, why fiat is so weak and cryptos so strong, you would never gamble on such a website. just get the currency you want, and never ever buy more than you can afford.
Real Markets! instead of some jerks, gambling for their own wealth, risking all others futures, in their crazy wallstreet casinos.

imagine how stupid you would feel, if you would have wasted any money on some thousand bitcoins and now only be millionaire... what poor idiots that are.. xD
Let me tell you where you find idiots: in the withe house, in all politics and in the fiat-gambling banks with there shitty bets on crap.
Crypto wins anyway :)

obama seems to be an honest person, with no obvious egoistic interest, unlike trump, who already ruined the lifes of thousands of americans and people over the world, with his greed and stupidness. look him up, he is a evil person, he doesnt care for anyone but himself.
really great choice, as if you wanted the whole world to either hate you or feel pitty for you. And in a few years, everyone will say, that whatever this maniac did, was not the fault of the american people, but he was elected, in your democratic system. You have no idea, in what sort of trouble you got yourselfs in, with this president. would you elect adolf hitler too, if he came back to be born in america? he also tried to make his country great again.. so why not, right? you are so far off the tracks..
Your currency is toilet paper to me.

Trump resuscitates something??!! Thanks for making me laugh buddy xD
Since my childhood i am wondering if there is some sort of highly efficient anti-intelligence program going on in the us.. now i know it must be true ;)
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:08:59
thats true, but i think the way eth works is still much, much better than fiat.
ofc i am not trusting on any coin yet, to survive all ages, but i know it's crypto currencies, that will make the race. I simply try to have some of any good crypto currency and stay on top of the news, some swing trading here and there, but mainly i feel like rescuing my money from a sinking ship :p
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:52:57
How big are the chances for that in your opinion?
I would like to see, how more people in america and over the world could afford food and healthcare, but i just dont see that coming for them.
I cant help it, i just feel unsave with usd, started with trumps election.. lost the last bit of trust in the usa. i never trusted the euro.. actually i dont trust any fiat anymore ^^ so my descission is made: i use crypto currencies and i am happy with it :)

i know, electricity is far from perfect, but burning oil and digging for gold doesnt help it at all. And we really need electricity, i think very few people could denie that, but we dont really need more gold than we have and we would not need the oil, if we had more electricity.
new technologies is what i want, thats why i say yes to crypto currencies and no to fiat. Yes to renewable energie, no to oil. Yes to the nice guy with the healthy tin, no to the new one, that looks and behaves like dudley dursley ;)

Thank you for sharing this Story.
I have no doubt about the truth of your words. But besides that, it would not be a far fetched or unrealistic story anyway.
I did not realise what crypto currencies really are, until now. Its simply the replacement for an old, weared out, crappy system, that made millions of good and innocent people suffer for the past decades until present.
I hope, that one day, you can buy some run down banks and make beautiful and secure homes for anyone you like ;)
Seriously, I wish all the best for you and your family.

or maybe it hits 3000 next week, but agreed, bitcoin is not going down anymore, these drops are nothing but opportunities, for the ones who still have too much of the old - soon to be worthless - fiat-money.
Enjoy the ride.

i know, it seems obvious, how the btc/usd ralley is gonna play out. but who cares what its worth in usd, i measure my account values in btc and eth. these are the real refrences to me atm, fiat money will be worthless anyways, until the day comes when i start spending this money, so why would i care? humanity has real money again, and its even better than gold and silver coins, we didnt have that for a hundred years, i am celebrating :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:20:32
consider the human lifes &amp; global resources of true value, that are still willingly destroyed, for mining gold and oil.

i don't think anyone here has a million bitcoins ;)
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:24:36
thats is exactly rigtht. there is still time to get out.

you name it "million dollar bitcoin".. what you want is the (2-3) million dollars, you may believe in crypto currencies or not, but obviously you just want to become rich without doing much for it. are people stupid enough to make you millionaire, just for setting up a cheap website, based on a poor idea of advertisment? its worth a try. good luck. 
oh wow you even write there: "Your link to your site will stay there for at least 5 years!" .. xD wow you are so genorous.. you actually support the people, who are supposed to make you rich, for 5 whole years! and then you get some other millions xD at least you take some time to check your website on your laptop, at your beach in the bahamas ;)

well if 99.some % of people would die in such a tragody, then there should be enough paper-money for the survivers.. they really thought ahead.
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:27:42
and how exactly would you improve crypto currency technology?
