why is trading (see  occurring on bitstamp while nobody can login?
@_date: 2014-07-05 10:10:50
Only the "no banks" philosophy of bitcoin is important besides of the impossibility to create money in the bitcoin economy, and just NOT the low fee's. The low fee's are only interresting when you make international transactions. Here in the Netherlands is electronic money transfer to every person in the Netherlands very easy, almost instant and for free when you have a bankaccount (which cost you about €15 a year) It is also for free to transfer money to an foreign bankaccount to allmost all countries in Europe.

Why think bad of them? Are there exchanges without difficult verification prcesses? I think it's concerning a small group of low volume traders who are early adopters because new customers and all high volume traders are allready verified.

I have calculated that about 5% from all bitcoin-qt client downloads is used for a full node. The rest  of the downloads are probably first time users who quit bitcoin-qt after several days downloading the blockchain :-)

As a newby is looking for information about Bitcoin and he googled "bitcoin" he is directed to sites (like wikipedia) which still gives bitcoin-qt client as first option.  I think every beginner starts with bitcoin-qt and quits after two days and then switch to a different wallet like mulitibit or something.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:03:38
I wanted to know if the growth in the number of users increases or decreases in a particular country. Overall, the number of users is constantly increasing, but is the increase constant or increasing or decreasing? 
I have made a number of graphs created from the data of downloads bitcoin-qt per country . I have token a number of countries that are constantly in the Top25, and have investigated the weeks 41-52/2013 and week 1-3/2014  
I know it is not entirely representative, but it probably indicates a trend. 
In [chart0]( we see the absolute number of downloads. Of course, we see a large peak for all countries, but especially for China and the USA, by the China "bubble " around week 48 after which it goes back rapidly.
However, when we put the number of downloads from each country versus the population of that country,  we get [chart2]( We see that other countries have relatively much more downloads than China and the USA.
If we filter the "China hype" out of the data, we get [chart3](
It can be concluded that the increase in most countries is constant linear while the Dutch market seems saturated and bitcoin in Sweden is "booming" at this time.
@_date: 2014-09-25 16:45:38
It's even more then one million times. I believe 1.9 million times. Is it to overload the bitcoin network?

It's a scam. They are only interessted in your data (adress and so on) to sell it.
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:27:57
If you have made a backup when you had 3 bitcoins then you have also the backup for your 43 btc. It's the same backup. An backup of your Multibit wallet is only your private adress and have nothing to do with your amount of btc in that adress.

@_date: 2014-04-18 20:45:18
It is very simple. Your small buy order is made through three small sell orders. Bitstamp did not divide your buy order but the sellers did that. The difference in fees is caused by rounding. 
"We kindly ask our users to take note on Bitstamp's policy regarding fee calculation. As our fees are calculated to two decimal places, all fees which might exceed this limitation are rounded up. The rounding up is executed in such a way, that the second decimal digit is always one digit value higher than it was before the rounding up. For example; a fee of 0.111 will be charged as 0.12."
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:55:03
It's because you placed a small order with fees in the $0.01 region. With a big order you don't have that problem and is the fee normal 0.5%.
Bitstamp has this fee structure to prevent misuse of the rounding feature.  Because otherwise it is possible to split up your order in a dozen small orders with a fee smaller then $0.005 and so paying nothing.

I live in the countryside with a adsl connection of 1Mb/s and my computer is a 5 year old Dell, so I stopped with Bitcoin-QT because of excessive bandwidth and CPU time use. I think full nodes should receive a portion of the fees to stimulate the use of a full node.

It is no clone of bitcoin to get rich in a fast way like most of the altcoins. Ofcourse it is based on Blockchain technology but with other properties. So Gulden lack the problems wherewith bitcoin now suffers. Gulden has a good development team. With Delta Gulden has a solution against 51% attaks and soon (Summer 2016) Gulden will improve the security with Prime.  Prime is all about blockchain security to prevent double spends and give merchants blockchain-grade insurance. On top of that Prime will integrate instant confirmations which will make Gulden so incredibly fast which will make Gulden perfect for daily use.

You 'd think the Chinese would be avoided Bitcoin after all the difficulties. But the opposite is true. In the ranking of downloading the bitcoin-qt client china is still in second place. The number of downloads increases the last few days of 2060 on Dec. 15 to 2807 at Dec. 18.

Conclusion: 
*There is still much work to do for the Bitcoin enthusiast. Penetration is in common very low. 
*In scandinavian countries Bitcoin is most accepted.
* United States has the most downloaders but in penetration degree is it ranked 11th.
*China has still a lousy penetration rate of 0.03%, rank 39.
