Yeah I thought he was alright, except about mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:13:17
Yeah, he was dead wrong about mining. Other that he had some clear points and seemed pretty reasonable. He just doesn't get WHY bitcoin. He doesn't get the desire for trustless and peer to peer. So he thinks it's all fake and speculative.

Hal Finney had plenty of time to arrange for.the access to his stash and said he sold them to make his end of life more comfortable. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:48:15
If he made the wallets, he could have kept the ability to.spend them.  If he's in bad shape first thing to do is to.make sure the coins are still there and move them to.a new wallet you control. As far as "taint" you should be fine.

Where do they get this bitcoin liquidity from? Who buys it?

Then the two swing back and forth until one becomes the "real" bitcoin and the other fails.  I would probably gamble on Gavin's plan by selling 10% of my holdings on the "small block" fork. Then I'd just wait. Whichever way it settled I'd just use that client. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 17:02:46
I think that's a great service/fee, as long as you're ready to handle the fact that people will sign up, wait, then dump in 1000s of dollars when there's a price spike. How do you plan to deal with high volume during times of high volatility?
Edit: whoops. Dollars only, no depositing bitcoins. Got it.

Oh, thanks. I'm guilty of skimming and reading the comments on this one.
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:24:28
I feel like the people who say Hal Finney is Satoshi haven't read the messages back and forth between them. He would have had the skills but the personality doesn't match. 
Hal Finney always came off as enthusiastic, curious, totally matches the face value narrative that Satoshi presented an idea and Hal jumped on it, gave it a fair shake and came back to jump on board and get excited. 
It doesn't seem like Finney would have burned all those coins instead of giving a larger portion to his family.  He just didn't seem like a prickly secretive person like Satoshi. More a tinkerer.  
Maybe someone who actually knew him would think differently.

I guess my sticking point that its a fact that he authored the paper. Even if her quote is accurate, he didn't admit authorship. Its not surprising he knew about it, his interests coincide with bitcoin enough that he could have dabbled with it at any point. 
If he received a shitstorm of attention in his quiet life and denies being THE S.N. of  bitcoin, where does the burden of proof lie? Would he have to prove he didn't write it, or would Newsweek have to prove he did?
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:43:16

This is my opinion: If that's your entire exposure, you're better off holding bitcoin itself instead of bitcoin stocks. By buying bitcoin, you're both investing in it and funding all companies in the space by propping the price. Once you feel exposed enough to bitcoin, that's the time to balance by taking some $$ out or investing in specific companies.

Most people using Ubuntu can download an installer too (maybe not compile from source) I've ended up with problems in virtual box because the Ubuntu ppa was way old.

An example: I have money in bitcoin that I received from someone who knows my identity, or from a public address. (Say a tip from an article.)
I want to use that money to donate to a gay rights group but my family is fundamentalist. Maybe I want to buy porn, or donate to a group that has politics my coworkers don't agree with. These are things that aren't illegal but make it worth having a tumbled wallet, especially as block chain analysis is developed further. Even separating my identity from my purchases so I don't get targeted by marketing is a possibility in the future.

Coinbase is not the most tolerant of companies when it comes to proving things about your money.  Setting up a paper wallet and keeping most of it there would be good. In case they freeze you. Better yet, take payment right to a wallet like mycelium, and use the paper for savings.

If Europe kept trucking after the plague I dont think society would shut down without the internet or computers. 
Bitcoins are durable in terms of long term storage. There are some ways they are more durable or secure than gold. For instance, in a WW2 situation, an army cant loot all of a citys bitcoins. 
There are other ways they are less durable, if worldwide computer communication gets messed up or an unforeseen problem causes something in the core design to stop working as intended.

That's where startups like bitpay come in.  They convert to USD at checkout, or a percentage you decide.  So, if I'm a business owner I obviously cant afford to risk having a price fluctuation waste my margins or my ability to pay my employees, but I can have 90% of the transaction turned into USD immediatly and leave the profit as BTC, or as Steam, NewEgg, ThinkGeek, etc would want to do, it can all go straight to USD.

It could have been a PR tactic. She is Director of PR for the Bitcoin Foundation. I'm on my phone and dont want to spell her name wrong.  She was very noticeable the whole time.

It's static info, but has two NFC patches.  One is public, facing out, and is intended for things like a bitcoin address, non sensitive info, maybe a business card. The other is smaller, meant to only be readable right next to it. It is meant to be worn on the inside of your hand and can hold things like an NFC unlock code for your phone or your door or your car. I don't see it being useful for sending bitcoin, but sure cool for receiving.

There are whole hosting companies set up to handle guild/ Eve Online Corp teamspeaks. Bitcoins great for that because you can pay dues into a wallet without anyone having to  put a card down. One feature that I think would drive that advantage is the ability for a number of people to be able to start the server, but only one or two administrate it. That would help form small coops. I would use this to take some load off of my server. For instance, I host a Minecraft server, but any of my friends who wants to mess around can start it up from a web interface.

The idea of having some kind of escrow in case you steal or lose funds seems good to me. Having it automatically be $500k or more whether you're serving 30 people or 20,000 is stupid and makes a horrible barrier to entry.

Hey that's where I was when I first bought bitcoin (because I thought it was awesome, I didn't think I'd make money). Its hard to save when you don't have excess money, because the tiny interest you get from the bank is nothing when youre lucky to put away a couple hundred a month. That's why things like bitcoin, no lose lotteries (popular abroad not allowed in the US) and stocks can make it more fun to save. Risk can be appealing in moderation.  *edit mistype
@_date: 2013-11-05 14:37:40
Pretty hard to do. The protocol says that if you can sign it its yours to spend. Even if a wallet has a limit, all malware has to do is grab the private key and make a new transaction itself.

After saying I had no interest in them, I bought one at about $20. It's energy efficient, which was the only reason I never GPU mined.

The purpose of shared send is to obfuscate who you sent the coins to. You send to a shared address on blockchain.info  It then sends the same amount to your recipient from another address.

Also it sounds like they are equating cleaning coins with money laundering. It's data hygiene. In a system where everything is transparent you have to be able to disassociate purchases from each other for basic privacy. Otherwise companies and government will be linking your financial data/id/browsing history. Bad. Bad bad bad bad. Money laundering is about hiding or disguising income. We are not obligated to provide anyone with a record of what we buy and where, unless I'm confused about the laws.  (USA, but I think this applies elsewhere too)

Yeah fraud is fraud, those businesses move millions every day. The logic with the bond is that they can't ghost with all of it. 
What really makes no sense, and purely serves the monopoly, is any sense of scale. You can't handle 10k a day and have a bond in scale with that (in the states that need it) plus you need to register by state and federally and do a ton of paperwork. Also, those laws being used to go after people moving money for their own communities or families are all about controlling money. 
I agree that it serves a monopoly, but I do think there are some kernels of consumer protection in there.

If you're holding large amounts, the worry right now would be an agency or bank freezing coinbases accounts and/or servers. I trust and use coinbase, but VCs can't protect against a change in the legal winds.

Well, unless you're changing money every day then the bank fees will probably be much less than the volatility of bitcoin over your trip. So you'll probably either make or lose money. It would be more fun with bitcoin, you can meet people from localbitcoins and ask about the bitcoin scene.

Also note that USB drives use wear leveling (may have the name wrong) and are very likely to keep data intact long after it is deleted. Because its solid state they use each part of the memory evenly rather than write over the beginning of the stick over and over. More cause for encrypted volumes. Or destroying the USB drive later. 
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:20:23
Some of those laws are really in place for consumer protection. You see the problem we have had with scams here in bitcoinland. The immigrant banking/unbanking industry is just as rife with predators. Look at check cashing businesses. Part of not letting anyone set up a booth with "I'll get your money to Mexico for $.25!" signs is about making sure that a screw up or bankruptcy won't make a lot of laborors money disappear. That said, the requirements are outdated and insanely overbearing. They refect a time when a company had to have a massive amount of money, because wealth couldn't move digitally. The western unions and the money grams don't want the law to evolve to show that a small player can move funds safely. I agree the laws are holding a monopoly. Maybe there needs to be recognition of micro-remitter status with reporting but no astronomical bond requirement.
 Anyway, no license is needed to send money yourself, only to do it on behalf of a third party. What we really need to do is create user friendly bitcoin interfaces so that people can do it themselves and send those dinosaurs with their billions in fees crumbling to dust.

From the end of FinCen's 3-18-2013 Guidence about Virtual Currencies:
"A person must exchange the currency of two or more countries to be considered a dealer in foreign exchange. Virtual currency does not meet the criteria to be considered a currency under the BSA, because it is not legal tender."
There is a difference between being accountable for value for gains and taxes and being regulated as a currency. A lot of rules could apply that bitcoin don't fit.

The chance of this being a clever beg post IS non zero, so don't give him the BTC he's not asking for. If this is legit, it would be good to identify what caused it.  It doesn't feel possible that anything automated could do it, but it seems like searching for a bitcoin client to flag a machine and keylogging a few days to go in manually later is possible.  If you see something like $password45782&amp; on a keylog, it stands out.

Just want to second that. Ive used your store for one major purchase and was very happy with the customer service and price. However, the browsing was so difficult I was shopping with two screens, comparing products on another site and then searching the model numbers on yours to see if you carried them.
