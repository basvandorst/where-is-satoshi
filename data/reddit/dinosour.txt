It bothers me that many people are so desperate to make a quick buck by purchasing GoxCoin at it's lowest despite knowing full well that they're ruining Bitcoin's integrity and potentially scamming their customers.
Stop using MTGox. Don't fucking cry when you get scammed because you're ruining it for us all by relying on one exchange and the whole market is suffering because of it.

Yeah, how dare they guarantee you actually receive BTC when you pay for it. Unlike a certain Gox...

Or it could further damage Bitcoin's reputation. People should be advised of the pitfalls in putting all your eggs in one shoddy basket.

The volatile price of Bitcoin is the price you pay especially when dealing with Coinbase. You are stuck with that transaction.
Personally, I opened a VISA card just to get their instant buys so I could make my micropayments instantly and not have to worry about price change.

Not sure if you understand how insolvency/bankruptcy works but I don't imagine anyone will pay to buy their debt.

This is the worst scam I've heard of as of yet and I have student loans...

Stupid people think they can make a quick buck on a second-rate exchange which may or may not work, but they're perpetuating reliance on an exchange that is effectively crashing the Bitcoin market.

Like GOX?
This is you right now:

This 1 million times. Everybody needs to stop using MTGox- which is sad because there are so many greedy pisswads that are going to use this as an opportunity to buy Bitcoin at a very low price. These are the same people that will bitch and whine when they discover they've been scammed. MTGox should not be relied on as a US-centered exchange and the fact that they're processing a handful of transactions does not redeem them from their shady business ethics.
At this point I wouldn't touch MTGox with a 10-foot pole and neither should any of you. If you fall for their trap and get scammed it's your own fault.

Because they have shitty business practices where they make significant changes to their service that they barely announce in two sentences in the middle of a huge blog post.
And also because they have Comcast-level of shit support and they frequently ignore tickets in spite of users that spend thousands of dollars a year there.

Yes, imagine that your stock is Bitcoin and your portfolio is your wallet.

It is not going to crash. If anything the speculation is going to convince a bunch of uneasy-minded holders to sell so that those who caused the speculation can re-buy at a lower price before it stabilizes past the 1k range.
If you were unconvinced at any other time: now is the last time you can buy before it costs you more than at least 1,000USD/1 Bitcoin. Now is absolutely not the time to sell.
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:52:27
I'm inclined to agree. Anyone who sells their Bitcoins today will be a victim of panic and speculation as it won't take long for it to stabilize past the 1k range.

I agree with you. Bitcoin is has made it very efficient for us to pay our accountholders because although technical it reduces some of the fear and hassle of dealing with PayPal or other payment providers. I know that I want to see Bitcoin secured as a viable online payment method so I am glad that we were able to experiment and use Bitcoin successfully.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:55:47
You fell for speculation, so what. Buy again and don't sell.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:18:44
Not unless you can variable the price of the products depending on the price of bitcoins.
