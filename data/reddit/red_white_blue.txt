I agree 100x with this sentiment. Don't pretend to be a 'we' when you're a 'you'. It's so obvious it's cringeworthy, not to mention dishonest and actually counterproductive to growing a returning client-base.
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:29:42
lol. No one likes business. Everyone loves individuals. This isn't the dot com bubble.

I'd give him the exact opposite advice. There's nothing more offputting than looking at business portfolio knowing full-well that they use the word 'we' constantly to appear professional and successful when it's clear that they are just an individual. It's really, really obvious and kind of cringeworthy.
Many creatives market themselves as individuals because that's who people like to interactive with. People like people; not faceless businesses. Individuals are concrete and personal whereas businesses without a face are trustless and ephemeral. 
Acting as a professional individual online; with a real name and a real face - will get you much further than pretending to be a business with more than one member of staff for the sheer sake of 'using *we* makes us look successful and bigger than we really are'.

Clients trust contractors that don't lie from the get-go. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 17:56:08
At some point at another your client will realise that you are an individual and that will be more damaging than anything - even if it isn't obvious from the start. You would have to go to great lengths to keep a client from suspecting you are really just one guy - great lengths for no 'pay off' seeing as the days when the majority would rather deal with a big business than an individual ended about a decade ago.
As a freelancer; ideally you want your clientele to be businesses as opposed to individuals (it pays far better, better scope for returning work, more interesting work, more security). Businesses are both more likely to see through your farce *and* more willing to work with individuals, who they can contract out on a freelance basis. They literally couldn't give a shit if you're *just one guy* as long as you're capable of the work they need. 
The only people 'being a business' would impress are the individuals that no one really wants to work with anyway; the 15-year olds who want a gaming blog, the out of touch mum with a 'hobby business', etc... These clients will never return anyway because they only need a one-fix wonder (and they will also complain about prices, avoid paying you, expect unrealistic turnarounds...).

If it crashes again I doubt it would permanently damage its reputation. So many people are ready to buy in hard if/when it does crash again, and in that consequence it will further strengthen peoples belief in BTC's longevity when it springs back into growth again.

I recommend against the miner. I'm not the most informed about mining but the word on the grapevine is that you'll see a better ROI by using the money you'd spend on a miner and just buy BTC outright (because of the increasing difficulty). 
Bitcointalk.org is the most active Bitcoin community I urge you to get involved with the learn more (literally, so so useful). 
 will take you through the first steps in creating a wallet, giving you your first Bitcoins (about 20pence worth) and then letting you make your first transaction (donating about 10pence to charity). It will also create a Blockchain wallet for you which will send you a verification email at the end of the tutorial. (Blockchain is considered by most to be the most secure/trusted online wallet).
I've heard a lot of good and bad about MT.Gox, so can't speak for them. But if you're looking to buy your first Bitcoins I really recommend localbitcoins.com - they provide results based on your location and you can read extensive feedback about each seller before you decide deal with them (how quickly they will release the coins is something i usually consider; some do this immediately whilst others take a day or two, which isn't necessarily an issue but keeps you out of that horrible 'limbo' of uncertainty as to whether you'll ever see the coins you just paid for.
