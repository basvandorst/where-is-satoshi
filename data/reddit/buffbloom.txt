These ups and downs are fun to ride and I just keep buying every week. Sometimes it's on sale, sometimes it's full price. Anything sub 10 is basically a fire sale

Any suggestions on a LN wallet? I've never used it.

Thanks for posting this

You think trump pays for anything? He'd probably just steal it if he thought that he could get away with it.

Thanks for posting about it.  I was trying to use Eclair but it was giving me trouble but Blue Wallet was very simple and so so fast.

Only the Canadian side of the falls is worth visiting.  Niagara Falls, NY is a surprisingly run down and shitty city with so much lost potential.

I set up a lightning wallet with the eclair app and I can't figure out how to connect the the LN tip bot to withdraw any tips. I know that I need to connect to a node and I tried to copy/paste the node address from the lnbot's info page but eclair told me that it was the wrong format. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

If you're willing to be patient with your buying, you'll get more BTC for your Dollar using Coinbase Pro.  The downfall is that you have to wait for deposits to clear.

$500 in 15 minutes seems significant enough to call it a giant dip just because of the quickness.  In the big picture, it's a nothing dip.

I love when I get busy on the weekend and don't check the price as often but I see a slow rise. Makes me feel warm inside.
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:29:35
Blue Wallet for Android was the easiest for me to figure out to receive.  I'm sure sending is just as easy.

The point is, is in the future that car is going to cost 2 btc (or whatever it is when we get there). Bitcoin in the future of finance and you won't even think of the dollar when making purchases. Just hodl and wait.

I'm thinking it'd be nice to be testing 11k right now. Or at least during the weekend.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:16:41
Was that just one massive dump earlier?  Did anyone catch how much was moved?
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:31:20
Yeah.  How much did your bowels move?  We must know!

Buy buy buy buy buy!! What a unannounced sale!
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:36:21
I feel personally targeted.
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:45:28
Snuck in an extra $50 deposit on Coinbase pro to take advantage of this sale we have going on.

Any digital asset, including money in banks, is pretty much just 1s and 0s.
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:26:59
Well, you made that easy and painless.
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:49:33
Can they dispute it if it's sent as a gift (friends &amp; family) option?
@_date: 2019-08-10 15:48:56
Woke up to a giant red candle and cat puke throughout the house.... I see you, Saturday.  You're still not going to ruin my mood.  Up, up, and away!
@_date: 2019-09-02 17:11:30
Oh that was a nice few seconds above 10k.  It's only a matter of time now
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:27:30
Coinbase Pro's price is all over the place.  Hundreds of dollars off from Kraken, sometimes higher, sometimes lower.

**From Coinbase:**










Not sure if this changes much for anyone but I just got this email.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:08:20
Does it have to be automatic?  I deposit $25 into Coinbase Pro every Friday and when I get the e-mail that the money is in my account I just buy immediately, regardless of price.  It's not automatic, but it's pretty damn simple.
With CashApp, you end up paying $100 or more than the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro.

There is not an actual paper dollar (coin, etc) for every USD.

Upvote the daily!  It's not sticky today.

Maybe I was misinterpreting a few of the posts within the last hour.  Forgive me, English is my first language.
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:46:38
Don't care... Just bought more.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:46:48
I just started watching a few different dudes on YouTube that break down the price with charts and news.  It's still a lot of mumbo jumbo to me and I'm pretty sure they're all just guessing but have no idea if things are going up or going down.  Still, my point, I feel like I've learned a bit and suggest this as an option to learn a bit more.

Upvote the daily so I can find it easily!!

Are people complaining about *only* being up 7½% in the last 24 hours just because it dropped $100 an hour ago?
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:48:53
Anyone freaking out needs to look at the 1 day chart and look how high we still are from Friday. Yesterday's movement was too weird to make any sense so if you weren't suspecting some pullback then you should worry about your instincts.

How did that dude raise twice as much money in 2012 than he has in any other election since 1996?

**Anderson Cooper:** Why would people have trust in something that is just numbers and letters? It doesn't have anything backing it up.
**Neha Narula:** I think to answer that question, you really have to go back to sorta the roots of money and what is money. The reason that the $5 bill in my wallet has value is because I know you'll take it from me for something. I can buy a sandwich from you with that $5 bill.
**Anderson Cooper:** So it has value because people believe in it?
**Neha Narula:** Exactly. And that's it. That's really it.
What do they think currency currently is?

Before the whole reorg talk, I was thinking that this was all an advertising ploy for Binance to boast about their insurance fund.
