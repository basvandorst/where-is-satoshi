Hodling's all you can do because the fees are too high to use it.  It will become a playtoy for the ultra rich, which hopefully will be us :-)
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:34:49
This is the current problem with BTC, it's gotten too popular, and miner fees are exorbitant ($15+), so moving a small sums is no longer worth it. Try an alt-coin instead. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:28:29
I ran into the same issue, albeit smaller scale, on Coinbase. Issue seemed to be that they won't hold your cash. With Coinbase everything was an ACH transaction, so buys and sells were all intimately tied to the ability to conduct the ACH, which has the limits. (I'm in a state where GDAX isn't allowed, so I can't speak to limits there).
I moved to Gemini, as they will maintain a cash balance in your account, so you can buy or sell larger amounts than you are allowed to transfer at any one time. But I've never exercised a larger withdraw from Gemini, so I don't know the limits imposed there. Their ACH input restrictions are low ($500), but bank wires have higher limits. 
So I as well would love to hear anyone relate an experiences with larger withdraws from Gemini. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:34:40
Yeah, a usable exchange, but with issues (like all of them), but also willing to screw you over if given the chance.  
A couple months back they kept their SmartCash wallet offline past the deadline where you needed to have possession of your coins to collect the monthly reward. They kept the reward.  Not much different than Bittrex holding people's Neo and not crediting them the Gas. 
And their interface is painfully slow if you're trying to access it from an Android device, so use a desktop. 
You can get second level access to increase the daily withdraw limit from 5k NZ-dollars to 50k, but you need to upload a copy of DL and pic of yourself.

Import your Jaxx private key into Coinomi. Coinomi let's you specify the fee.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:54:53
It's had a different feel since it bounced off of $20k and then failed to hold $17k on the recovery. Despite an influx of new people into the market (exchanges disabling new accounts due to the massive influx) there seemingly are no buyers. I had thought alts were eating bitcoins lunch due to sky-high fees, but that's not the case anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:46:06
My reasons to hold were tax delay or minimization. But yes, if you think this is going to drop fast and hard, then don't let taxes stop you from exiting. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:20:15
I hate to break the news to you, but I've been having an affair with bitcoin for the last year and a half. 
That's right Mr. Limpy, your bitcoin is a two-timing whore! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:08:05
My purpose was just to illuminate a problem with the currency, one it used not to have. Used to be everyone wanted it to replace worthless fiat. It can't do that now.  It's not even acknowledged as a problem. If Bitcoin had worked like this in 2009, it would have never amounted to anything valuable. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:10:26
Like the rest of us. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:04:04
Try Afterburner (written by the Samourai wallet people) from the Android app store. It's suppose to enable you to add to the fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:11:15
I transferred from a non-segwit wallet to segwit Nano S. No problems. Perfectly safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:23:34
There was a time not long ago where people used to talk about bitcoin replacing the need for the Fed and banks. How does that happen now? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:18:39
Yeah, at this point, that does seem to be the only avenue for a trustless currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:23:14
I don't see that. Maybe you're right, but there are plenty of reasons to hold assets until early 2018 rather than ditch them now. For example, (1) to delay taxes on gains until Apr 2019 versus 2018;  (2) benefit from lower tax rate on 2018 income from new tax law (assuming you are in the US); (3) holding longer potentially turns assets into long-term capital gains, rather than short term. 
Basically, there could be reasons to accelerate the obligations of taxes into this year, but I see reasons why that wouldn't be the case as well. 
Always willing to learn, so please correct as needed. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:49:59
Coinomi allows for paper wallet sweep, but not importing. Sweeping isn't "using your paper wallet" so much as "transferring from your paper wallet". If you want to access and transact off the paper wallet's private key, what's a good app for this? 
I realize no one recommends importing paper wallets, but sweeping incurs a transaction, and at $30 per transaction, it's prohibitive if the wallet has a smaller sum on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:46:39
Finally they'll own an appreciating asset!

Not trying to FUD. Lightning sounds great, but what about the regulatory considerations. I don't know if this article is all completely true, but it does sound like something the government would do, or already has.

It's the +25% days that spook me. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:56:22
Jaxx does that. No delineation between the "standard" fee levels. I went to Coinoni because it was actually flexible. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:42:42
This is correct.  First 30 of the month are free.  Bitcoin purchase fees are reasonable too, lower than the miner fees of late. How they stay in business I can't figure out (please don't tell me they lose money on each transaction but make it up in volume :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:33:23
Or they'll convince the politicians to tax the bitcoin investors to pay for the bank bailouts. Either way they'll end up with the money. They always do. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:57:33
Long time holder, like entry under $1000? Or in at $7500 and looking for some gains and a pullback?

Same here. Only coins I regret are the ones I sold. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:07:22
You could try Afterburner on the Playstore. Suppose to be able to add fees to stuck transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:34:04
I agree with bitn0d3 in that bitcoin is in flux now. This started as a payment scheme (solving the double spend problem that plagued easily-replicatable digital assets), but it has morphed from there due to its scarcity. Now everyone talks about store-of-value, but it's hard to see how it continues as a store-of-value if its value is lessened by the inability to transact with it. I'm not sure what happens to the price when this thing losses mass adoption. Maybe the price increases as it becomes an instrument only for the rich. Our maybe the price tanks as it's doing now. Definitely a state of flux. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:02:41
Yes. Wish I knew when it will end. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:13:35
Not exactly living up to your name there,  Mr. Ass.
@_date: 2017-08-31 07:02:35
Yes, everyone's posting 10sat/b transactions going through, but if you want to guarantee that the transaction goes through on the very next block, then you need to hedge your fee higher. Just tonight I bought some coin on Gemini and sent it to Bittrex. Gemini still doesn't charge the customer a separate transfer fee, but I looked up the transaction on blockchain.info and it carried a 423sat/b fee with it.  Certainly Gemini could have paid less, even bitcoinfees.21.co is recommending "only" 360sat/b, but Gemini wanted to guarantee a prompt transfer or else they get service tickets opened up.  
So yes, you can pay a lot less and maybe not even have to wait longer for the transaction to get through, but no doubt Coinbase is just passing along the added cost to guarantee that this happens. 
@_date: 2019-08-26 23:46:34
You really ought to maintain your own private keys, but if you're just not comfortable with that, store it in an exchange, like Coinbase. Storing on an exchange is not a good solution, but it is infinitely better than someone you really don't know. 
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:42:54
Yes, do this, migrate to Coinomi. You just have get used to setting the fees yourself in the settings menu. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:26:23
Bitcoin Afterburner on the Play store. I haven't actually used it yet, but adding to tx fees is what it claims to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:21:22
Maybe this doesn't apply to you, but in the US the tax consequences of taking the gain and then jumping back in do not make financial sense unless it's a large drop in price. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:35:39
Must be incomplete documentation, or they were booted out of Oregon after initially being active there. I'm in the same boat, in MN. Sucks as the fees are so much lower on GDAX.

You're looking at weekly-averaged data there. Of course you're not going to see the dips. Real dips that you should take advantage of don't last a week long, they tend to close up pretty fast, so use limit orders to lie in wait.

@_date: 2017-11-21 04:07:36
I agree. We're all dependent on mass adoption to increase demand to lift the price. And mass adoption isn't going to flourish at $2-$5 tx costs, even for larger purchases. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:02:29
With the caveat that that wallet needs to support the new coin before you move your coins off of that wallet. 
Else you have to be willing to export the private key of that wallet into another new-coin supporting wallet with the same type key.

Really?  BCH isn't simply an asset with zero basis? I have to pretend I got cash?  And then, I suppose, pay capital gains on the difference when I finally sell? 
One last question.  Are you left to enter all exchange transaction data, or can you import a spreadsheet that was downloaded from the exchange? Thx
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:56:35
I gave it some thought, but the tax liabilities in the US don't make it a strategy likely to pay off (to anyone other than the government).  You have to account for the ~20% loss in taxes, and the loss of any B2X revenue from having sold pre-split.  
Best to follow the conventional wisdom and hodl. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:55:51
Block mining has been slow. Instead of blocks every 10min, they've been mining about every half hour.  Review the chart for details.

@_date: 2017-11-16 01:12:25
Not true. Coinbase is fine, with great documentation as well, but thru are 6x the price of Gemini, when using their standard client or mobile app. Try GDAX (if allowed in your state) if you want Gemini-like fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:40:28
A wallet that let's you set the specific transaction fee is an absolute must.

Yeah, if you zoom in you can see the top and bottom of the "sticks".  Not obvious zoomed out on a handheld. 
Anyway, so what's the beef?  Often the "corrections" return to the previous cycle's high. That's your opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:08:59
Exactly - a huge pain in the ass when trading currencies.  
The IRS has easy-to-find information on this, it's just painful to read since non of it tilts the taxpayer's way. You can almost just ask yourself, "How could they REALLY screw me"? The answer to that will be correct.

Backing up the truck, slowly as it continues to make lower lows with staged limit orders.  Whether I hit the actual low won't matter a year from now. I view this as an opportunity I may not get again.
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:19:38
This is exactly why I ditched Jaxx. It supposedly allows for three graded  levels of tx fees (fast, medium, slow), but many times the slow fee was not significantly different than the medium fee, which itself was 4x too high. It was an unnecessarily costly wallet to use. So I moved to Coinomi which allows for complete user control over the applied fee, albeit an awkward method of setting the fee for each transaction. 
@_date: 2019-04-28 20:37:37
To a degree. But recall the 2017 price spike that brought usage so high it lead to near $50 fees, producing an unusable currency. And fees don't have to go anywhere near that to limit utility. 1MB per 10mins may not be enough to allow BC to be used the world over, even with LN.
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:01:52
More like one and a half years. If the halvening doesn't cause the price to start to rise, then I doubt anything will.  
(Ok, except maybe China or India getting back in).
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:50:32
I fully agree. I had hoped the price stability would slowly encourage its use as a currency, which it was intended to be. Unfortunately I really believe that period of ultra high fees permanently destroyed its being broadly accepted for that. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:53:30
I agree. Why would I use a monetary instrument to purchase a product when that monetary instrument appreciates approx 60% a year?  I'll use dollars that are worth less every year as our government prints more and more. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:55:59
All the more hot for you if you've got an extra $1k of Bitcoin profit in your pocket!  
OP - yes, should work, if the price is stable enough, and these moments, it aint. Why risk the time delay. They can send you the bitcoin as soon as they buy it and avoid the risk that the price will drop in the interim. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:21:03
That's really the sum of it, isn't it. 
Either you're going to split them yourself (get a couple full-mode wallets and some untainted (new block reward coins - 100 blocks later) to mix together so that only one species comes out of a purifying transaction) or you're going to get a service, corporate based or an independent benevolent developer, to do the heavy lifting. It all comes down to your risk aversion for each option. 
For me, I'm leaning towards trusting Coinbase as they have a billion dollar rep to protect. They claim availability in two days.  Others may choose differently. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:12:35
Wait.  Billions whiped off of BTC because of a hardfork of BCH?  Can anyone even think of a mechanism of why that would happen?

@_date: 2017-09-13 23:34:07
Studying the detailed mechanics of cryptocurrencies sounds like a great idea since this is a new and growing market. Whether Bitcoin or some other government-issued cryptocurrency eventually become the new medium, a digital asset will eventually dominate. Knowing all about the underlying mechanics will prepare you for a livelihood in some aspect of the field.

Kudos to you for wanting to learn. Too much to type out, you'll learn in time, by doing. 
First off, you'll need to get a wallet - no problem if you have a smartphone. 
And you'll need to get some coin - problem if you're not over 18, as you can't enter into a legal agreement with a registered exchange, Gemini and Coinbase are most popular in the US. So you'll need a parent's help, or perhaps Local Bitcoins, but I've never used them so you'll need to look them up on the web. 
Welcome aboard. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 00:45:24
Gemini is the cheapest I know, but if you need larger cash transfers, then you'll need to wire it in. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:19:01
Interesting....it must mean something.
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:35:33
Sure, as long as the transaction/exchange fees aren't chewing away a  significant percentage of your investment. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:17:03
Coinbase and Gemini are the most popular $ exchanges, and very trustworthy. But both are the same with regards to the need for identifying information for higher spend limits. Advantages/disadvantages to each, so best to research exactly what you're looking for in terms of spend/sell limits, cash transfer limits and commission costs. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:39:11
Yeah, you're right. I just noticed that my Jaxx wallet lists it as unconfirmed. And it doesn't show in a block yet, so it's just from the mempool. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 03:22:47
I've had very fast transfers off of Gemini as well. But HOW does that happen?  With blocks written, on average, every ten minutes, can it be that I am so lucky that I often submit transactions just as the blocks are mined?  Why does it rarely actually take over 5 minutes for the transaction to post? (Unless it's coming out of Coinbase - then it's hours).
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:55:39
It does that for me too on my phone. Works on the desktop version, however.

The usual. Transmission through an African prince who needs your assistance and will pay you handsomely.
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:24:39
It's good. Thorough yet simple. 
Still, I'd modify that section at the beginning entitled Cheap Transactions. It ain't true now, and if the miners have any say, it won't be true in the future. 
Also, near the end you have a sentence: "If you look at the slope of the line recently, its nowhere near as steep as it got in the last spike two spikes." 
I think you have one extra "spike" in there. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:34:36
Is there anything that stops a miner from simply opting to mine empty blocks rather than including transactions?  Is it only the transaction fee that encourages them to add the transactions? 
@_date: 2017-06-15 04:36:14
I found the easiest way to do this was to import the paper wallet into Jaxx on my phone, and then to transfer from there. YMMV.
