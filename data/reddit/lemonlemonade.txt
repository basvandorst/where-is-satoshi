We're at $~~125~~ 115 USD on Bitstamp. Crazy.

Except not. Bitstamp is on Cloudflare and still had serious problems.

Cool, thanks! :) Timezones are confusing.

But you still can prove you were at the store with that person at X:XX time and also sent bitcoins at that exact same time, right? And you can prove you own the address who sent it. Still doesn't help a heck of a lot i guess though.
Best of luck with it!

Huh, exactly the same notice (with style and all) as instawallet. Didn't know they are the same guys.

Bought at 229. Only one though, luckily, but some of my profit i so carefully made last few weeks went poof.
Interesting almost all the exchanges are having trouble. Bitcoinity has almost no feed updates for the last hour for most exchanges.

Also, some more info from the wiki:
Since Bitcoin addresses are basically random numbers, it is possible, although extremely unlikely, for two people to independently generate the same address. This is called a collision. If this happens, then both the original owner of the address and the colliding owner could spend money sent to that address. It would not be possible for the colliding person to spend the original owner's entire wallet (or vice versa). If you were to intentionally try to make a collision, it would currently take 2^107 times longer to generate a colliding Bitcoin address than to generate a block. As long as the signing and hashing algorithms remain cryptographically strong, it will likely always be more profitable to collect generations and transaction fees than to try to create collisions.

And that's still true. But those *encrypted* keys are now stolen.
If you have a weak password and those keys are encrypted with that weak password then it's easy to crack them. If you have a very, very strong password there probably is nothing to worry about.

This is really cool. How is it these universities can do this for free though? Reminds me a bit about Khan. Please note I have no idea how educational systems work.

Bitstamp ~~$109~~ $97.11.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:22:46
Of course. Everywhere (all the exchanges) i know of. Just enter the amount and buy them.

Looks real *real* nice, but unfortunately gives an error (blob-error-thngy) as soon as I press the print button in Safari. Is this a known thing?

First post, tumblr url, looks legit.
@_date: 2013-03-31 11:41:57

You must be thinking about NVC?
