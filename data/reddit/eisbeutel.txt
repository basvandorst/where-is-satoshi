any progress here? still wanting some :D
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:34:27
still in the process of collecting more information. 
Seems like there's not really a problem in bip39, electrums approach just has more functionality (like different languages for the words)

exactly my way of thinking! it more convinient to use a hardware wallet, but not really more secure long-time. I suppose I'll get used to a tiered approach. little coin in mobile smartphone app for daily use, a hardware wallet for more coin that feeds the smartphone app and a paper wallet that only gets funds send into it for longterm storage.

they look great, but could you create some without the text? sadly it looks shitty with text on my iphone SE:
would look better if the text wouln't collide with the watch.

If you wait much longer it will be 7$ instead of 7k$
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:20:34
please, keep your sarcasm for or other shitsubs :)
Just wanted to play the worst-case scenario in my head to think about every possibility. Better safe than sorry I guess!

so ledger uses bip39, right. Therefore, I have to hope that in 20 years bip39 is still the used standard. If it's not I have to find some legacy wallet software that used it and try to recover there....
not exactly my definition of bullet-proof security, as already the creators of electrum use something different from bip39 as they believe it not to be as secure as possible...

really interested in the moon and the rollercoaster guy with an Iphone 5S / Iphone SE (same screen) as base :) thank you very much!
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:22:47
thats the answer I needed, thanks! I'll look into the bip39 function then.

can you still log into coinbase? are transfers to a different bitcoin wallet possible? if so, transfer the funds to a wallet you own and look for a buyer, I dunno if  is a thing in Nepal, you could try it there
