Ehh how much for the cliffsnotes?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:36:13
This could happen. Or it could shoot up to 20k overnight. Making absolutely baseless predictions like these is dumb.

If we go back to the pre-Christmas crash when all cryptos tanked together like this, they all bounced back together too. It might stop at $10k/BTC, it might go lower, but I'm almost positive it will bounce back. People have been saying the bottom will drop out since forever. I've panic sold enough to know this too shall pass.

Looking at these comments it's funny how it's just history repeating. Go back and read the threads from the pre-Christmas crash. It's the same shit. Nothing has popped. Don't panic sell. Get off reddit and chill out for a few days. Thank me later.

Nobody knows. Do what you gotta do.

If you have a USD account, I don't know why you would transfer directly from BTC to bank account. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the fees are lower if you transfer to USD first.

Oh no! It's going down to the ATH from a week ago! Calm your tits and HODL.

The trendline for LTC usually follows BTC, with the only distinction being when LTC falls, it usually falls more, percentage-wise.

I wouldn't be surprised if it takes a week or more. Chill out.

[Some helpful phone numbers lol](

Saw it go all the way down to $12.8k.

I'm pretty sure they incorporate the 1.49% (higher if credit card) fee into their buy/sell prices. That's why they're higher and lower, respectively.

BCH being at $7.5k when on other exchanges it was still around $3k should have been enough of a clue NOT to place that buy order...
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:16:39
Yeah I'm gonna say that's still your fault...
- GDAX brings in a new crypto unexpectedly and allows USD trading immediately
- It spikes to obscene values not seen on other exchanges, seemingly instantly
Red flags fucking everywhere. I wouldn't have even touched someone else touching that with a 10 foot pole.

I appreciate honesty lol

Coinbase's fees get automatically added to the buy price.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:50:39
I'm still able to buy on GDAX...
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:48:08
Right there with you... I feel like a damn fool.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:08
It's not just BTC, all cryptos just took a huge shit today.
Edit: fine not Ripple
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:52:07
Aww. Ok.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:14:26
lol k
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:39:00
Let's say it crashes to sub-$1k before it recovers. Better to get in at $1k than $12k...
