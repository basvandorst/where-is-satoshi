it would be 1 btc = 1 usd and it would be pointless  
edit: maybe not the 1 to 1 but it would be pointless

like i said in my comment. yes they would need to exchange. but since they are a big company with investors i think they can do the exchange with themselves. like i originally said

no problem. Ive done multiple purchases and I remember having the same question
@_date: 2014-01-02 17:24:27
Now that changes things up. the price would be low but i definitely see it more than 1 USD or 1 EURO. Since bitcoin is backend by acceptance/community/(an ideal), the more you have of these the more its worth.
@_date: 2014-01-03 16:32:41
they probably have Fiat and Bitcoin and do the exchange within themselves to give to you. while also buying either form of currency they need to continue the business. i doubt they actually take your currency and put it in an exchange. that seems risky
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:47:50
i'd laugh if you missed

oh my fault. i suck at reading
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:56:14
you get the price you ordered it at the time of ordering. so last week when you ordered thats the price, so yes $802.

Yeah it's going down and might go down to where we started. But to be awesome it's nice to see bitcoin act like a real market and a double top also means a new ceiling to break. Always ask yourself: Am I an Investor or a Trader? This always helps me eliminate the emotions.

in that case i could bring this post to also note that this is a large BITCOIN transaction, which sadly enough isnt a normal large transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:28:40
the company/organization that would act as your bank doesn't have to be transparent. theres no way to inforce such a policy. plus this entity would have to make money in order to keep providing the service so now you just brought in additional fees, another reason people want bitcoins and not banks.

soo if i were to make bitcoin paper money to represent that you have X bitcoins. eventually people could just inflate with that paper money being PRINTED off. the cycle WILL repeat if you set it up to

could be completely wrong here, but I think the (.com) is the actually wallet running and for use. (.org) is the project so others can contribute and help out.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:07:45
i dont really think india will effect anything mainly because there was no upward response when they were showing activity there. rupee doesnt hold much value compared to china's 50% activity toward bitcoin. As for "china dude" its not big enough or comparable enough to their original impact they had with their banking situation
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:27:32
I hold BTC (why: well its the most popular), LTC (why: its kind of my first coin that i got into), and DOGE (why: keeps me sane with its good attitude community)
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:32:23
if you are buying coins just focus on bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:16:59
I use coinbase, hence i do ACH. I have Chase. large transactions (10k+) equals a large transaction for bitcoin. I really dont know how to say this any better. buying bitcoin is new and special to banks. Buying a million dollar manison is like w/e but buying bitcoin in general you will be looked at.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:00:34
why because we went down 1% in the last 2 hours?
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:35:38
yeah i just hold my coins right now. I buy occasionally, on coinbase, but mainly I mine, so i end up with different coins depending on which has the best exchange rate to BTC

@_date: 2013-12-26 20:50:13
but the fact that its a newish coin and pools are that established it comes down to "luck" of finding the blocks

if you print of paper money to be backed by bitcoin i can inflate the money just printing more. thats how it works with gold being backed by usd. we dont have vouchers like it originally started off like. i understand that bitcoin is infinite but if you are just talking about printing off paper representations of bitcoin than that is not infinite  
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:08:33
yeah its weird all the chase problems im seeing, when i've had no issues with coinbase myself (i have chase)

nope, not that i know for positive 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:12:42
soo the system where if would start off being backed wouldnt move in a way like it is now where dollars arent really backed by gold? why would you think things would be different because we just changed what our paper money is backed by. we mind as well just replace gold with bitcoins literally so our USD and EURO are just backed by bitcoins instead
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:08:36
you do realize that bringing banks into bitcoins defeats the purpose of bitcoins

if looks like a joke and smells like a joke its probably a..., what?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:55:12
well it really depends on your believes/strategy. if you want to "invest" money I would say yes but you have to believe it will go up, for whatever reasons you have. This is known as being "long". so people will say, "I'm long bitcoin" being they are in it for years(2+).  
Now if you are short thats where it gets tricky because hype, news and everything else matters.  
but what it really comes down to is do you want the coin or do you want to sell for fiat. if you are long price never matters. if you are short than you need to do more research to figure out what is going to bring you more money.  
Note: im long bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:13:12
yeah im right there with you about my mentality with BTC. Can never be to safe
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:51:01
lol just wouldn't work out

I dont mine bitcoin. I mine other altcoins then trade for bitcoin. yeah bitcoin is not really worth mining unless you can offer to dish out for ASICs

yeah thats actually what im currently mining.

lol but honestly i see it as any other market so sure

soooo you posted on reddit telling people to sell because you have a hunch/guess. in that case... Buy its going to 10k a coin, dont miss out
@_date: 2013-12-20 13:09:40
I feel its hard to say that bitcoin crashes in the general sense compared to stocks. the reason i say this is because crashing is about of bitcoins life. thats kind of what bitcoin does. to even say its volatile is almost wrong too because again its just how bitcoin is. That being said I would never really argue someone for saying these things about bitcoin  
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:42:27
sometimes the banks have a lot to do with these problems. Its normally with large amounts, this would be considered a large amount. Given I dont know your intentions with bitcoin but i will assume they are just not investment or support for the coin. As a bank may look at this transaction and think theres something suspicious
