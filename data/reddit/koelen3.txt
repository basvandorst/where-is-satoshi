That's because everyone wants to buy BTC right now
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:04:45
You sir, are a real hero for giving those away! Wow, respect much
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:25:56
Pizza party!

Sponsor a CSGO tournament, there will be betting on csgolounge for the match, this means that there will be more then 20.000 viewers watching, at least!
Try to sponsor a team, LDLC.com for example, big electronic store in Europe, it would be great if they were to accept Bitcoin in Europe like overstock.

Sounds like Paypal to me
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:16:56
I'm joining your club, I remember mining a single bitcoin with shitty CPU's... Ah, these good old times...
***Edit*** I also remember the day bitcoin dropped from 10€ to 4€
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:13:28
And where do you see the briefcase handed over to the guy?
@_date: 2014-01-19 19:34:28
You're a bit late mate. I bought Sushi from Pizza.be on the eleventh of Novembre with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:45:59
Thank you
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:48:39
Is there a full translation of this please?
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:26:00
I have no faith in fiat, let apple block paypal apps too please.
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:50:26
I know, I've also told about China in my last line **and** someone else already stated that so I didn't need to rewrite it :)
@_date: 2014-01-13 21:59:16
I laughed when I saw eBay
@_date: 2014-06-17 10:16:04
Done, thank you, your website looks nice, but your mobile site could be done better.
Or you can simply make one, if you need help on that, feel free to contact me
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:31:33
So now we can win our disputes on Paypal? NO.
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:13:29
Pizza party with bitcoins of course
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:03:07
We've came a long way to reach these 100k. I would also like to thank reddit for doing this now.
When we hit 1m, -75% reddit gold? :)
@_date: 2014-01-07 22:46:51
You should definiatly tell your boss that if you start accepting BTC as a major retailer, the whole BTC community will know and that this is an extra type of income.
I'm thinking about online purchases, and positive feedback. Look to Armagi Metals, they started to accept BTC, many guys know about them and they are also processing over seas orders. 
Make a thread on bitcointalk.org, vouches will come in and you'll gain the name and trust from the Bitcoin community.
Your boss can still give it a shot for like 3 months and see how it goes. If that turns out well, then congratulations, if not, you've still tried it and others will follow.
@_date: 2014-01-25 22:26:42
Yes! Let's all go and buy these lovely **Daim's** with our bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:19:32
They also bought drugs some time ago, here's the source, go to minute 1:00 :
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:39:14
Still making profit in 2015 huh? They couldn't even handle 2014, nor 2013, nor 2012 and 2011
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:52:51
No offense, that website you give as screenshot looks like a template from joomla or wordpress
@_date: 2014-03-25 10:37:41
If I was you, I would just drive there and pick up your package.
@_date: 2014-01-06 20:40:59
So did the 1 milionth wallet got something?
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:36:39
I hope you will click on good. They won't be expecting that.
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:19:43
I didn't expect to see the Horse &amp; Farm section
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:16:55
Better get a girlfriend soon
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:43:55
Here's one. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:08:57
Maybe mtgox is selling their 'lost' 750K bitcoins
@_date: 2014-01-24 08:12:19
I guess this is the factor. I've also seen, that it are small amounts that are being sold and that are keeping the drop. Probably, and I say this isn't true, but this could be. That overstock.com and tigerdirect are teaming up and try to get the price lower, so that they can raise the price after this drop and get more profit. Because a lower price means they would get more BTC.
But after all, don't forget about the Chinese too
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:30:11
... Pool rewards ...
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:49:39
looks like dogecoin last year
@_date: 2014-06-05 15:15:39
I see a price rise coming
@_date: 2014-01-15 08:06:20
Didn't it involved facebook? How could people without facebook enter the giveaway?
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:29:52
I don't think a lot of people in 3rd world countries have an iPhone though.
@_date: 2017-06-05 13:55:51


Yeah right
@_date: 2017-06-01 19:23:45
As a student, feel free to send an uber to my place. Got some bills lying under my mattress
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:33:03
Ah well in the meantime BTC and NVC have been raising so I don't care much about time as I made a bit more bank now :)
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:20:32
I know, and I don't say they are shady, it's just a mystery why my password stopped working after the new address was made.
I'm sure I'm using the right password because the latest back-up I have still works with that password, however after I made the new address the password isn't working anymore.
I would also like to refer to this thread where the problem is almost common to mine.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:47:10
Alright, take your time.
I'll be waiting for your reply
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:47:25
That grammar! Bitch please, when sending a phishing mail, make sure your grammar is above 12 years old..
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:39:49
I would've said Chinese, Russian or French. But then I thought it was racist to say that.
Just like Sint Nicholas his helpers are black which is also racist right now..
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:46:03
Indeed, I mentioned that like 2 posts ago?
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:12:10
That's why I meet first without cash. Then verify they have the BTC and then go with him/her to the bank.
Once you give him the money in the bank office, he'll need to send a text message to localbitcoins to release escrow
@_date: 2013-11-02 01:23:39
And so do I
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:46:16
I guess you then risk the fact of being stabbed or something.
I still guess my method is better then saying I have no money
@_date: 2013-11-02 01:18:08
I know, I've been in the game long enough to know that.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:19:00
I just got an update that Mandrik has looked up my wallet.
I guess it all will go well asap
@_date: 2013-10-30 08:42:58
Indeed, but this glitch costed me around 90€ worth of bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-11-01 21:26:05
I like how you acted, note the post above from piuk, looks like it wasn't my fault and I knew it
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:08:15
It's funny, because I keep my Mac malware and virus free.
And I keep my password stored in my head, it has 15+ characters and is a combination of special characters and both UPPER and LOW case characters.
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:33:57
I have my back ups, indeed.
But I guess there is a DDoS on their login server.
Since I'm getting errors to their host lately
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:42:25
Yes, it gives me an error that says trough or to the U.S. Only flights
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:21:40
Let me guess, you were all looking to the Trollbox?
@_date: 2013-10-29 22:09:49
How could it be my fault when my password worked 5 minutes before making the new address and then stops working after I make a new address on my wallet and then stops working?
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:24:41
Tried to contact 1and1.com ?
I saw the website is hosted there, to be hosted, normally all your info should be real. I'm sure you can get his address and name and so on if you use some presure on them with your lawyer.
What you also can do, but this won't be easy. I'll PM you it :)
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:43:14
If I type in for example;
Brussels Belgium - Lisbon Portugal
I get the error, either departure not recognized or, only US flights, you can check that
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:26:56
Indeed, I totally agree
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:58:26
No, they don't.
But I guess they will in the future?
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:37:59
Aah, that iphone bug... I still remember everyone downvoted my threads on saying stuff like this while Mandrik and me discovered a bug in the iPhone app. Well, actually he did the searching stuff and I was telling what happened in lots of details.
@_date: 2013-10-08 06:22:35
You missed a zero ;)
