I knew the dump was going to happen just like I’m predicting the next few days will be a surge. It’s pure whale manipulation. That’s what they do. Anybody who could not see that dump is an idiot. The whales perform heavy dumps every 4-5 days at the most. That dump was well overdue.. since there wasn’t a dump since last Monday.

My name is stokelycalm (spelled backwards). The stupid mods banned me. I’m here to say I’m the biggest shorter. To me nothing is a greater Hardon than watching HODLERS piss their pants and lose their money. We all know Bitcoin will revert to $20K+ but I’m a shorter who believes it will fall to $4k before it returns. I’m stokelycalm and I’m the biggest shorter. Please thumbs up my comment lol

You’re an idiot. It will hit 8k again!

Of course, some institutional investors are already in but most are involved minimally. Institutional investors are still observing Bitcoin trends and waiting for it to hit rock bottom which it still hasn’t. Most institutional investors will not buy Bitcoin at rock bottom but at a more convincing bottom than $5900 (once the $6000 BTC resistance is broken, a new hell will break loose and the whales will be directing that crash course). Most institutional investors will actually buy when they see far more bullish trends and not the back-and-forth volatility we’ve been accustomed to the past few months. Institutional investors don’t like volatility. Once they see stability and bullish trends after Bitcoin bottoms at the $75 billion market cap ($4400/bitcoin) and recovers to $200 billion ($12K/coin)...that will regain confidence with institutional investors. From that point on, Bitcoin will soar to new highs $60k/BTC and a crypto market in the trillions. This is an inevitability but it will take time. That’s why those who HODL will be rewarded exponentially. But, most people grow anxiously impatient. Just like we have many slow Bitcoin days ahead, we will also have days when you can make thousands of $$ overnight. I made about $6K last night.

Bcash volatility is a scary thing right now especially if you’re a day trader like me. It’s not a good idea to daytrade Bcash, week trade may suit you much better (one trade a week). BCash has been stuck in the $1200-$1500 range for over a weeks. It’s pure whale manipulation via buy-sell walls maneuvering in forward and reverse directions. The whole concept from the whales is to psychologically test inexperienced traders and day traders using emotions and fear. The whales are being very spontaneous and confusing to get you to panic-buy and panic-sell. Of course the Bitcoin ABC fork is less than 2 weeks away which is the primary catalyst from our lows in early April. This is why BCash will not dip below $1200. The whales themselves fear institutional investors beating them at the own game, so they will not allow Bcash to crash until the fork is released. Also, the whales are challenging the Bcash market to see how ordinary traders respond within every surge. This far, they have been very disappointed which is why they continue to fluctuate Bcash in hope the market reacts differently.

Claymore, I like a lot of what you have to say but you need to stop saying “in my opinion.” I’m here to speak objectively on this matter and that may sound contradictory since this can be a very speculative subject. Are whales and institutional investors the same thing? Yes and no. There are several whales who bought large volumes of Bitcoin in its infant days and scored big. The Winklevoss twins are the perfect example of this. There are many whales who aren’t as savvy as you’d expect; they just own a lot of Bitcoin. They don’t have any connection to corporations and institutional investors like hedge fund managers, investment banks, mutual funds etc. This is what separates the typical notion of whales with institutional investors. They share many similarities and institutional investors can become whales but whales typically do not become institutional investors. Whales have been around since the beginning, institutional investors are new to BTC. When institutional investors fully mobilize with Bitcoin, we will see its largest gains ever because Bitcoin will finally have a keen sense of legitimacy. However, even today, Bitcoin is still being questioned and associated with labels like “pyramid scheme”, “black market”and “money laundering.” This is the biggest challenge for Bitcoin (and definitely not mining or hashrate as you unnecessarily brought up). Bitcoin was founded as an alternative to the greedy practices of banks and investment managers like Goldman Sachs, but it’s still perceived to be a get rich quick scheme.
Institutional investors will help bring credence to this asset class (the irony being that institutional investors are very shady people). Your remark about HODLers wasn’t necessary. I agree with you in the grand scheme of things, HODLers have very little influence over BTC’s price...but they do control their own wealth through personal decisions. Overall, you do have some good things to say; you’re just misinformed on institutional investors relationship with Bitcoin.

Does saying “come on Bulls” everyday like you’re a Michael Jordan fan really lead to a bullish market? Of course not but it keeps BitcoinAlways afloat.

Yea but $500 of value less for each BTC than you did yesterday. Meanwhile, I saved myself $500. So, I could buy in right now and have more Bitcoins today than I would have if I just held. I’m not pissing or moaning. I’m enjoying myself.

HODL is smart. It does suck you will lose money temporarily but Bitcoin will soar past $20K again and you will win. Either HODL, be a whale or have stop limit orders... or you will lose big time.

Not trying to. I hate whales. Whales are screwing people over. Unless you’re a whale yourself, you do understand how they turn Bitcoin into a scam. They represent 50% of the whole market. Think about it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:14:05
You guys are all misspelling the word “hold.” Yes I know what hold on for dear life is but HODL is still not a word. One idiot misspells the word “hold” and many follow.

4 months ago, bitcoin was worth $20K. Today it’s less than half that value. From that perspective, Bitcoin should be $4400 come August/September.

Why is everyone hating on me? I’m sending you a kind warning that imminent crash is developing. You can kill the messenger or you can choose not to listen to the messenger... but why the animosity?

Bitcoin is a get rich scheme. Many have become millionaire overnight by getting in at the perfect time while others have lost life savings. There is no regulation and nothing in place to prevent price manipulation from whales. It’s the exact same thing as stocks and insider trading but it’s worse since the SEC is hardly involved. You can love blockchain technology and invest in companies promoting it but Bitcoin And cryptocurrency which was not intended to be a scam...has turned exactly into a get rich quick scam.

You talk like an over privileged whale yourself. Yea people freak out because many have invested their hard earned money without having seen any gains and only negative return on their return. It’s very normal to freak out when whales are constantly manipulating the market. Yea maybe these peoples shouldn’t be investing but it’s addictive especially when you’re trying to recoup your losses. Your arrogance and condescending attitude is not necessary here, you ass.
