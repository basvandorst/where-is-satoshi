And what if you bought a $1,000,000 gift card for $800,000?   Still don't understand why it would be taxed?

Yes it does, and no it doesn't.   I'm not rephrasing it because if you can't comprehend a 3rd grader, you have no business asking the stupid questions you do.  It's the exact same question you asked but with different numbers.   It's really not that hard.

If you can't understand that question you have no business making stupid statements like your OP. Bye now!

Good god what a horrible job of quoting someone

There's a reason it's called investment *advice* and not investment *commands*.    Nobody's "copable" for following advice except for the person following the advice.   Peter hasn't seen a dime from the vast majority of gold bugs, by the way.  Gold is just a part of his business - he manages funds in several non-gold-related mutual funds (as most of europac's mutual funds are), foreign stocks, commodities and currencies.    He'd be just fine without gold bugs.

Do you have an answer for this question? 
And I agree, you are an idiot for contemplating such nonsense.
