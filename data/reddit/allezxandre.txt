I used your referal link for Xapo. Does Xapo work the same way as shift?

I'm living in France, where can I see if I can get a Xapo card?

I'm what's happening? What's a FinalHash?

Oh… Ok. That was easy. Still had to DuckduckGo 'Google' though.

Should have voted for Le Pen then... 
I might be optimistic, but I believe in a future where both coexist, as we transition from FIAT to digital currency, not because one system collapsed, but because the other one is more modern, better, and overall much more integrated to our convenient digital lives.

Eff you too! I'm still trying to get to 1! The price and the fact that it's so easy to pay with Bitcoin on the internet aren't helping!

For cryptocurrencies that want to prevent ASIC mining from being too profitable, VRAM matters a lot. The Ethereum mining algorithm has memory requirements that try to follow GPU VRAM trends. With lower VRAM than required, the memory bandwidth would be the bottleneck to the performance of your rig.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, doesn't care.

I'm in Europe, and I use bitstamp. Much lower fees than Coinbase (0.25% vs 1.49% IIRC), and better rates. 
Their website and mobile app is not as good though, it looks more secure, but a lot of times the UI does not tell you what you just did with your money, and often times I thought I just lost money. But I see this flaw as another incentive to keep my coins in my own wallets.
