I think you may be misunderstanding some concepts.
CPFP means that the address that the bitcoin was sent to (but not confirmed) can spend the unconfirmed transaction forward. If you own the receiving address, you should see the transaction listed, but unconfirmed. You can go ahead and spend that unconfirmed amount forward to a new address; you should set a higher fee/byte than used in the previous transaction depending on the current fee market, and you should understand that it will amount to a higher overall fee as the transaction byte size is bigger (two transactions). The child transaction literally pays for the parent transaction, but it also has to pay for its own transaction.
If you don’t own the address that the amount was sent to and can’t let them know that they could spend the unconfirmed amount, blockchain.info actually allows you to export your seed through the backup option. Load it up into a wallet like Electrum and you can do whatever you want with it. You can then try and double spend the transaction with a higher fee.

Had the same problem and couldn’t wait, so loaded it up on Electrum and it works just fine. Unlock the ledger and open the Bitcoin app on the device, then create a new standard wallet on Electrum using the hardware wallet option and changing 44 to 49 where it asks you for the derivation path for SegWit.

That’s not his core argument, though; he prefaces the importance of an energy-dependent security system, explains how the energy usage does not need to grow to remain globally secure, and also highlights the energy toll trust systems entail, with their scaling being dependent on increasing energy usage.

Oh ok. I still think it’s worded quite poorly: “created for use in online transactions” sounds like a 12 yo writing an essay trying to sound smart. Or maybe I’m just being pedantic as it also assumes intent of creation to be the use of online transactions, whereas we know the intent was the disuse of financial institutions as third parties.
Paypal is used for online transactions and can be considered a currency in the same way that bitcoin was created for making online transactions.

But energy consumption is not dependent on the amount of transactions so you can’t really spout a kWh/tx figure unless you’re describing a current snapshot of the network. Energy/transaction does not describe the bitcoin protocol, as you could have the whole network run by a handful of miners, it’s just gonna be less secure. ASIC miners are beasts in consumption right now, but the mining rewards would potentially make it less profitable in the future, which would mean lower energy consumption? That’s just speculation on my part.
AFAIK, LN nodes would consume about the same energy as non-mining nodes, as the verification and adding to the blockchain of the final transaction is carried out by miners on the bitcoin network.
The amount of energy consumed is a small price to pay for having a trustless and decentralized globally secure network. How else would you do that and avoid increasing energy demand with scaling? 
Fifty years ago, the energy we consume nowadays would be considered preposterous. Surely you don’t need that computer, and tablet, and phone, and electric car, and coal-burning dirty car,  and jet travel, and air conditioning, and cryptokitties. Civilizations evolve to use the energy demanded. The network security matters more than most energy demands being met today. 
Bitcoin isn’t what’s gonna melt the ice caps, it’s negligible in the grand scheme of things.

Well actually if you’re backing up the app on iCloud, when you reinstall it it installs from the latest backup. I have bitWallet and backed up my keys manually just in case before I deleted the app, and when I downloaded it, the keys restored just fine.
I have also switched phones and the backup has carried through the restoration process.
Can you make sure iCloud backup was turned on for apps and specifically for bitWallet? It sounds like it was off. Go to Settings and pull down to reveal search, and then search for ‘Storage’, first result. Scroll down to list of apps and see that bitWallet is there and turned on. If you go into Manage Storage from up top you should see bitWallet listed, including the size of the backup. That bitWallet entry should exist even if the app has been deleted.
If the app is listed in the backups and you know that it was turned on before losing the keys, all you have to do is delete the app and reinstall it. Try doing that, and manually backup any keys this time in case you have been using the new ones.
If the backups exist and you want to access them, you can find the individual ones from within the app settings, iCloud backups: [here’s a screenshot of the page showing the backups](

Not intentional, it just happens, it’s almost impossible to time the market anyway. If you’re not day trading, and you are invested in bitcoin for the long run, buying an ATH won’t do you much harm, as long as you’re expecting bitcoin to be valued higher in the long term.
Although nobody likes to see the price crash, except for the flash sales, a lot of us are in bitcoin because we believe it may be the future of money and love what the cryptoworld is doing, and not because of its speculative pricing.

You don’t have to worry if you can see the transaction broadcasted, you can check on any block explorer with your transaction id.
If you need it now, I  believe you can try spending it from the receiving address, but you’d have to pay a high enough fee to cover the parent transaction that’s currently not getting picked up.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:09:01
Some fee estimation algorithms also consider the history of average transaction fees, and in this case it overestimates the price.
I don’t think fee estimation is where it’s at yet, as wallet developers would rather not hear about stuck transactions. I always underbid the estimated fees by a factor appropriate for the mempool, but algorithms that do that reliably without wanting to risk angering users are still not available.

Somebody could perhaps chime in on this, but here’s how I understand it in situations like these; before second layer or sidechain solutions are implemented, wouldn’t it behoove the merchant to employ *child pays for parent* to move the transaction along to a different address in order to most convenience their client?
Also, I’m not sure how apprehensive merchants would be about accepting a client’s unconfirmed broadcasted transactions in return for goods, seeing as in a face to face situation and for low-value items most people wouldn’t try double-spending, same as most people don’t always chargeback credit on items they’ve bought.
Perhaps it would be at the discretion of each merchant to require some confirmations for high-value items. As a rule of thumb, maybe it would make sense to accept zero confirmations in times when the current average transaction fee equals the value of the item purchased.
You make some good points, but I’m sure there’s some smart and experienced people here that have thought about it, and hopefully they’ll chime in.

Fees are high during hours of high transactional traffic, but they’re otherwise not high at all. Fee estimation algorithms are unfortunately largely lacking at the moment, and are not as competitive as could be, since wallet developers would rather not have support tickets about unconfirmed transactions.
With SegWit, second layer, and sidechains, fees will be even lower.
Either way, if you don’t need a transaction confirming right away, always underestimate the fees and they’ll get picked up once the traffic dies down. Replace by fee if you change your mind.

That’s great, you should be a proud son. I don’t think Bitcoin would be for my parents, though, not that they’re technologically inept at all. However, unfortunately there’s a higher barrier to entry for older people who may have trouble getting into the habit of managing passwords for websites such as Facebook, let alone securely storing private keys or seeds.
Trusted and sandboxed iOS wallets may be user friendly and secure enough, but are too risky for larger sums of money, especially when even younger users may not be educated enough about how such systems may be compromised.
Most of the time, the weakest link in the security chain is the human, and I believe we need to either do better in educating the public of how to secure themselves or investing in systems that shield them from risk.
Bitcoin doesn’t rely on cryptography that’s just “good enough”, and we shouldn’t either when securing our savings. Perhaps the only way I would think about getting my parents invested in the system is if I set up their saving and spending wallets and also held onto a second backup of their seeds, although I disagree with having the responsibility of being someone else’s bank.
I do see a future where security in technology will be second nature to most people, but not sure how we’ll get there; I think Bitcoin and literally putting money in technology is the right step towards that, but I wonder how far away we are from easy and secure adoption by the general public.

It would make sense to have a Chrome build specifically installed to run hardware wallet apps, but then that defeats the purpose of developing apps for a browser to begin with.

If everybody starts buying cows with Bitcoin (spending), then the market price of cows in BTC will be, in theory, driven up. If everybody starts selling BTC for USD (exchanging), then the market price of USD in BTC will be driven up, i.e. Bitcoin valuation in USD will drop.
