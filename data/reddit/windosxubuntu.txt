As a business, you will never be able to make everyone happy.  Some people will always be unreasonable and make demands that would put you out of business.  That said, here is how to use Bitcoin:
So you have decided to use Bitcoin-
We here at X store are excited to except Bitcoin for our items.  While Bitcoin is the future, we want you to be aware that this is a pilot project as Bitcoin is still very volatile.  If you would like to pay with Bitcoin, please be aware of the conditions:
*All purchases made in Bitcoin have a 5X (or whatever multiplier you can give) points reward, similar to using a Best Buy card at their store.  The points would only be 1x or 2x with cash or credit, etc.  [This is the discount to the customer, and it gives them incentive to come back to make another purchase with those points or make more purchases to accumulate more points.]  
*All RETURNS on purchases made with Bitcoin will ONLY be for an exchange on the same item or store credit.  [This is the downside to the customer.] (You can also set a grace period of say 7 or 14 days but that would make a risk so I'd advise not to.) NO EXCEPTIONS.
*(here is the part you DO NOT advertise.) If a consumer attempts to make a return and are not satisfied with an exchange or store credit, have a manager speak with them.  If they have a good case, i.e. the item was DOA and is discontinued, have them fill out a "secret" return form and have them SIGN it. Make them aware it will take some time to process as this is a new field for them.  During that time frame, if Bitcoin price is lower than what they paid then they are aware that they are lucky enough to have this special exception made for them despite store policy against refunds on bitcoin purchases. ($1k fridge bought for 1btc, 1btc returned at $900 per btc current rate). If the Bitcoin price is higher, make them aware that Bitcoin is volatile in nature and they should be so lucky that you are making an exception for them despite store policy. ($1k fridge bought for 1btc, .9 btc returned because btc now worth more). You can opt to let them keep the extra 5X points to pacify a grumpy customer.
It will be the job of a good sales team to take a customer who wants to return an item and sell them a different item.  They can make a "special price" on an item that is below sticker price if your set your margins accordingly.  Again, this is a special case to be made on a case by case basis. 
To solve the issue of the unreasonable customer who thinks you can "eat" the loss of a new fridge, similar to the customer who broke their own 55 inch tv in the back of their smart car and wants you to replace it- Point to the conditions listed clearly on the wall that I listed above.  These are the customers you can afford to lose because they would put you out of business if you gave in to their unreasonable demands. Since every customer and case is different, the one size fits all approach does not work.  That is why you have advertised store policy and unadvertised special exception policy.

but will the rescue cd still work after 30 days or do u have to buy a subscription?

Im just venting because they never told me it would take a week or that all other transactions would be frozen until AFTER the transaction.  Im going to be mad if I go to make a larger buy and I would have to pay more money because they would not let me make the transaction sooner.  Im still mad that I couldnt verify the credit card for whatever reason.

I could not find anything on your website regarding security or safeguards. How do you protect against hacking or bitcoin theft? This would be  beneficial to mention on your site.

arent there some web sites out there that give out "free" bitcoins for watching ads and other silly tasks? maybe it came from one of them?

the iomega zip drives were rarer.  id try that before a floppy.  id also imagine some of the very old mp3 players that used proprietary usb cables would work too.  me, ill just wait for the digital wallets to come out and then come down in price.

then simply add in the 7-14 day return period. best buy has a return period of 14 days for big electronics.

Id put it up for a vote with a poll of options since different people donated. That said, i would like to see it go towards the first bitcoin college scholarship. I like the positive publicity seans outpost has brought to bitcoin but we need more things like this. There are still people out there who only associate bitcoin with silk road and the more we change the image the more it will be accepted (and the value will go up). The scholarship should go to a bright student that makes the best contribution to the bitcoin network through any open source project that makes it better. If it catches on it could be an annual thing....

re: the second ruling-
what if you are not a COMPANY or business but an individual buying speculating and using bitcoin? You are not a money transmitter until....?
@_date: 2014-01-16 19:29:18
This is important and should be a post of its own, if it is not already. Dangerous waters lie ahead for users.

interesting, but the pasted conversation is a loop. text 228 is the same as 520 and so on.  Needs a TL;DR.

This looks great.  Will you guys be at the Inside Bitcoins Conference?  Id really like to see some of your products in person and Im sure it would help you get some early sales in since youre terminals should start shipping right around the time of it, right?

For anyone that is actually interested for the novelty or whatever, be aware the address listed at the bottom is

Does that 2-3 month break even rule apply to lesser cards for those of us with less dough and weaker power supplies?

Prediction- Price drops as panic sellers unload when the auction finally happens, then the price recovers and then increases as the auction generates publicity and more people scoop up more coins.  The rollercoaster is about to get bumpy again but it has persevered through worse so I only have a little fear.  
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:59:28
Does anyone want my pass for tomorrow's conference? I will not be able to go.

unfortunately, the link in the guide to micro$oft shows that XP mode only works on windows 7, not 8 or XP.  Have any other guides or know how to do it in Windows 8.1? Would i have to go thru virtualbox?

have you ever found any apps that have been malicious to your btc wallets? what permission is needed to access them? The privacy manager xposed framework is pretty good at limiting apps beyond their needed reach.

Nexus 5 or Moto X, depending on which carrier youre on.  Stay as close to the untainted Google experience as possible and youll be glad you did.  Both are available off contract for reasonable prices if you have to shell out cash for an unsubsidized phone. A nexus 7 tablet with mobile data / lte might also be an option for you (and actually cheaper) since you can pop a sim card into it and be in business.

back when this idea was first mentioned on the forum, it probably sounded like a sweet deal to order one of these for only 1 bitcoin. Over a year later, ~$800 (or 1 btc) sounds like way too much for one of these.  Did they adjust the price?
@_date: 2016-02-04 06:31:33
This is a great idea.  But how do they get people on board? 
@_date: 2013-12-28 15:19:54
I am still wondering why there are no brick and mortar stores to get bitcoin when bitcoin can be used to buy goods or services at some stores.  It is hard to see where they draw the line between allowing fund transfers and becoming a money transmitter. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:57:29
This is the guidance mentioned btw
