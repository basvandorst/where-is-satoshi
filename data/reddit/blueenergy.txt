I had a similar issue, with a 44-char private key, not starting with 5,K,L. More info here: 
In short, like others have said already, try importing the key into Blockchain.info. If it works, send your coins elsewhere to a better address under your control.

That's of course true, but not everyone cares to own their Bitcoin directly by holding the keys -- which can be challenging to do for the average person. Many people are happy to have someone else hold it for them.
If they understand enough about Bitcoin, they can buy some directly and hold their keys.
If they just want to invest in security and try to make some money, they can buy a Bitcoin ETF, and not be bothered by the technical demands of security private keys. Any ETF or stock is actually held by a custodian anyway.
@_date: 2015-08-30 09:55:34


Whoa. Could you please elaborate, or point me to somewhere that explains this? I occasionally reuse addresses out of convenience, figuring there's only a minor security compromise. But maybe it's worse than I think?
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:56:57
Thanks for the great wallet and for all the hard work you guys put into it (as well as providing great, prompt support by email and here on reddit).
Didn't realize you guys have a Twitter feed. Bookmarked.
Small request (perhaps you're already working on this): option to select launched block explorer. Blockchain.info seems to be more unstable lately...

I was at the two bitcoin ATMs in the Mission district of SF, mentioned already in this thread. That was back in June 2015, and I used the Lamassu machine there -- 1-way, fiat-&gt;BTC, ~5% fee, no ID needed.
I saw the BitAccess machine right next to it (might've had "Zenbox" branding), made for 2-way transactions (ID required), but didn't use it. I think I was told it was out of operation at the time anyway.
Both machines were situated there at "20Mission" (yup, Mission St &amp; 20th Ave), in that shared market space. Specifically, the ATMs were next to "Nakamoto's", a bitcoin store, I think owned by Purse.io. But the ATMs probably weren't owned/run by the store.
I think biz hours there were just afternoons or so.
During my time in SF, I visited that Lamassu ATM a few times, in part because it frequently ran out of bitcoins, and the owner needed to periodically restock it (perhaps remotely), so I was told by a neighboring staff member.
Someone (owner or clerk?) posted the ATM's bitcoin send-address on the machine, so people could check the available balance beforehand, without having to show up and be disappointed. This came in handy.
I checked the 2 transactions on my phone that I had made with that machine, and indeed they came from the same bitcoin address. Even the change addresses were also identical.
Assuming that address is still being used with that ATM machine, here it is, and it appears to be active (although empty at the moment):

Many thanks on this, Luke. I'll check out that article right now.
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:03:51
Haven't they always had a 2-way BTM? There was one there in June 2015 when I used the Lamassu right next to it.
I guess they replaced the one I saw with this new one.

Did you select an alias to use for login, so you don't have to use the long wallet identifier string? Maybe the alias you selected was too common a word, and hackers are trying it.
@_date: 2015-08-10 08:32:17
My experience has been that the Bitcoin ATMs that are willing to buy bitcoins from you and spit out cash are the ones likely to require ID. The ones that act as 1-way vending machines and only sell bitcoins for inserted cash tend to not require ID. Lamassu and Skyhook are 2 examples of the latter.
The ID requirement may also vary from state to state. Or, if there's no explicit requirement in a state, the ATM operator or manufacturer may "play it safe" by incorporating the ID requirement.
At least that's all my take on things.
@_date: 2015-08-03 14:08:56
Ok thanks for the referral. I just checked it out. I see what you mean.

If you're comfortable paying in cash and meeting strangers in a public location... check out the Mycelium Android app. Their Local Trader functionality connects you with people in your area. I've used it myself several times without a problem.
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:33:51
Thanks, trasla.
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:01:36

@_date: 2015-08-27 12:05:34
After selecting the fee option, try going back in to re-specify the send amount and hit "Max". I should auto re-calculate the proper amount to send.
@_date: 2015-08-30 09:57:52
Yes, it definitely is. You might want to take a few minutes and read up on the basics of public/private key cryptography. The math behind it enables all kinds of things to securely happen in the world that we take for granted -- like secure web browsing, and even entering your PIN into a standard ATM machine.
If I understand things properly, if the miner were to change the destination address, the signature simply wouldn't match up, and the transaction wouldn't validate and couldn't be written to the blockchain.
Edit: typos.
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:52:29
Request for Mycelium: a new option in the app for a "High Priority" miner's fee. Perhaps 1mBTC?
@_date: 2015-08-04 12:52:26
Agreed. Still would be nice to have an option for a manually selected fee.

What's a good/recommended web-based wallet that also uses Blockchain.info's model of having most of the wallet code be client-site javascript, where private keys can only be decrypted in the browser, and the server doesn't store any recovery password or such?
@_date: 2015-07-18 12:00:30
... on average.
@_date: 2015-08-06 09:02:56
Agreed. Nice analogy.
@_date: 2015-08-13 20:31:21
If you have an Android phone, check out Mycelium -- the Local Trader portion of the app. There might be people local to you.
@_date: 2015-08-13 20:49:53
Indeed, the Mycelium crew (and their app) are pretty awesome.
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:41:33
Having the same problem here. Past few *days* for me it was limited to sporadic problems accessing Local Trader, but the Wallet part of Mycelium appeared fine. Today, however, my Wallet too won't connect to Mycelium servers, as others here are experiencing too.
Only tried 1 device, but on 3+ different internet connections. US-based.
I posted some details yesterday in this thread:
Yep, error 99's here for main Wallet connectivity failures, and HTTP error 404s/502s for LT failures.
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:20:31
Yeah, and if it helps them feel more comfortable about it while leading up to meeting them (without having yet tapped Accept Trade), I just stay in prompt regular contact with them via the chat feature.
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:19:32
Ah, fantastic trick! One of those UUN (under ur nose) ideas.
@_date: 2015-07-23 11:16:22
This service sounds a lot like the Mycelium local trader app.
@_date: 2015-07-30 07:44:28
Or the Mycelium app for your smartphone - the Local Trader part of it. It'll help you find people in your area willing to trade cash for bitcoins in person.
@_date: 2015-08-10 13:00:32
In addition to what's already been said, there's a popular theory that after a hard fork, it wouldn't be long before one of the forks grows in popularity as the effective "real Bitcoin" and the other one quickly withers away. You then have a winner and a loser, and life goes on.
@_date: 2015-07-15 05:31:10
But my recommendation still stands. Or, a custom/adjustable fee amount. It would be great to be able to select/specify a large miner fee so as to speed past spam transactions, when it's important to do so.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:35:20
I usually hold off on clicking "Accept Trade" until I see them in person.
@_date: 2015-07-25 14:39:59
Am curious: why ask for a selfie? Just to make it easier to know who they are when you meet in person in a public place?
Also, how do they usually send you the selfie? Image posting site/URL?
@_date: 2015-07-26 09:17:07
Ah ok, thanks. The context now makes sense.
@_date: 2015-07-15 20:03:41
Ah ok, that sounds good. But, I'm just thinking ahead for situations like recently, where the preset amounts may not be enough to outpace the spam transactions, and there's no "High Priority" or Custom setting for fees. If another unforeseen circumstance arrives (or a fee calculation bug/issue), it might be nice to have a Custom option as a workaround or "fast lane" bypass if the calc'd values, for whatever reason, aren't sufficient.
@_date: 2017-04-17 07:36:21
I just noticed that too. If any1 here hears back from the admins with any info, pls share. Edit: Oh, I just read the "Edit" up above by the OP. If they were being DDoS'd for several days, why not announce that on their social media feeds?

It's kind of a good thing IMO. It's like challenging your immune system to make it stronger. Or going to the gym for strength training or to build your endurance.
Stressing the bitcoin network is giving it a sample of legitimate traffic levels in the upcoming months/years, so that deficiencies in the strength of the network can be identified and fixed in advance, whether that's about block size or many other factors.
@_date: 2015-09-09 19:53:54
That's how it was explained to me by the person who introduced me to it. There are tons of people out there in the world who get Starbucks gift cards as gifts and happily sell them for cash at various online marketplaces at a steep discount.

Thanks for the heads-up. So, I guess I should be prepared for sudden unexpected personal information/documentation requirements above and beyond what's stated, if I go with Kraken (which was 1 of the reasons I stopped climbing the ladder at Coinbase). I guess this sort of thing could happen at any exchange though.
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:40:41
Sheesh, what a PITA. If that were me, as soon as the $ arrived in my account, I'd trade it for crypto, withdraw it all, and then never use Kraken again.
If I go with Kraken, maybe I'll do my first wire transfer deposit for about $1.50 or so in case this kind of delay happens.
@_date: 2017-05-08 01:43:13
Thx for the clarity on that. I see it now (ACH vs. Wire) in their FAQ pages. Must've missed that level of detail earlier. I should now consider Gemini as a possibility.
ACH - do you know if they link bank accounts via micro-deposits or bank login? MDs are the classic method and more secure, but take a few days to confirm. Bank login is the new way that's quicker, but one must enter their bank un/pw &amp; have a proxy service do a login for you.
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:01:35
Can any1 confirm they allow ACH xfers in the US?
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:08:58
I remember coming across some similar discussions about this topic here on reddit:
I particularly like the metaphor mentioned (assuming the math is correct) in 1 of those threads: "I've got 140 trillion earth-sized spheres. On one of them, I have randomly selected a single square millimeter as the prize winning spot. Find it, and you'll get to spin the prize wheel to see how much you've won."
And for those who don't know about this clever demonstration of the number space of keys, I think this website might've launched with the teasing announcement "Warning, all bitcoin private keys leaked!": 
@_date: 2015-11-04 13:43:49
"Each address has on average 2^96 private keys that unlock it"
Oh my. So the private key I have for my single bitcoin address is just 1 of 2^96 other potential private keys that will also unlock that address for sends? And to confirm, I shouldn't be worried because?: 1) I generated the private key with much randomness, and 2) It's still incredibly unlikely that someone will generate another private key that maps/hashes to my bitcoin address.
Can someone in the know please confirm the above?
In thinking about this, I've also wondered... If it's actually happened in the wild -- that someone or 2+ people have generated more than 1 private key for a single btc address -- shouldn't it be detectable on the blockchain, assuming that the address has made some btc sends?
In other words, has anyone analyzed the blockchain to look for any btc addresses that have sent funds, but in different instances using different public keys? If that's happened, wouldn't that indicate &gt;1 private key had been discovered for that btc address?
Maybe it's not worth even doing that analysis, given the giant numbers at play here. But maybe it'd be an easy programming task anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:07:14
Thanks so much for sharing your detailed experience here. I'm on the hunt for a BTC exchange as well, one that satisfies my own list of criteria.

I had a similar problem with a Lamassu BTM a few months ago (not the same location as you). While I had had a few successful purchases from that BTM previously, I then had 1 transaction where the coins just simply didn't show up, ever, at my destination address.
Since that BTM did all of its sends from the same bitcoin address, I kept an eye on it both before and after the transaction, and my purchased transaction simply never appeared on the blockchain at all.
I eventually was able to contact the BTM owner, and he eventually confirmed the exact dollar amount I lost, as overage physically still in the machine, and he manually sent me the bitcoin several days later.
My guess of the problem -- while I was awaiting/dealing with the failed transaction, I noticed that Blockchain.info was having one of its site-outages, which wasn't infrequent during that time. The BTM owner seemed to say he machine used the Blockchain.info API, so perhaps their API failed in some way that the BTM software couldn't handle/process. Just a theory.
@_date: 2016-05-29 22:01:32
I received the same "we're aware of this issue" response to my customer support inquiry a couple weeks ago.
I'm guessing 30% chance it's a legal order/issue.
60% chance I figure it broke in some way, and they're taking their time fixing it. It has broken in the past, and within a few hours or days they'd fix it. Now, it's only part of their legacy wallet, which they're presumably phasing out, so maybe its repair priority is even lower.
I also would gamble a 10% chance they might actually be bringing it into their new wallet, and so they'd then may be letting it languish in their old wallet instead of fixing it.
I do hope it comes back. While I hear great things about JoinMarket, it's currently a bit technical to set up. Shared Coin, OTOH, while not super-secure, offered a good compromise of medium-privacy with great ease-of-use, being in a web UI.
@_date: 2017-05-07 17:57:27
Thanks for the suggestions. No margin trading here; that's kinda too advanced alchemy for me!
Gemini - Their FAQ pages say max $500 daily deposit. I need a little more than that. I don't wanna have to send 4 sequential daily wire transfers just to deposit $2K. (And pay 10% in bank wire fees.)
GDAX - I'm trying to avoid Coinbase. I had some frustrating experiences with them last year while trying to register and get started. Too many bugs, delays, and unanswered support emails turned me off.
itBit - They seem pretty professional and solid. Prolly a good option. However, itBit doesn't do US ACH deposits, whereas Kraken is slated to add ACH this year.

Thanks for your clarifications, murbul. Much appreciated.
The blockchain analysis I speak of, for instances of &gt;1 public key for the same btc address: yeah, I figured it wouldn't be hard, but very likely the analysis would come up empty-handed.
But on the off-chance such an instance was found, that might be a disappointing dent in Bitcoin's armor.
(Idea: maybe someone could set up a website that always checks each new block for that very rare instance, reassuring the public every ~10 minutes that no instances of multiple keys have been detected anywhere on the blockchain.)

Regarding deposits, they seem to have a wire option for US customers to a US bank, handled by Synapse Pay. But that's just what I read in their FAQ/support area.

That explains the tiers, but I don't see any USD limits there.

Mixing services have various drawbacks, as well as advantages too. There are different kinds. Nothing it 100% private/secure/anonymous. JoinMarket is another service you can use, but may require more technical setup.
Bitmixer.io - I've used them several times without any major problems. The link you provided with an issue: if you follow it over to the Bitcoin Talk forum and follow the thread, you'll see the OP got the mistake eventually fixed by Bitmixer and all was good in the end.

So in the first case -- nlocktime -- I guess the sender is thus responsible for holding the tx offline until it's valid to broadcast on the network.
With CLTV, do you know of a way I can find an example of such a tx on the blockchain, and how to read its unlocking timestamp or height ?
Thanks.
