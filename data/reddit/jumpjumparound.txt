Amazon is a trusted merchant, things still break.  Escrow will charge fees and then your ruining the best part of Bitcoin.  ECB doesn't get to decide if something is a Ponzi scheme or not.  If the people who held the most bitcoin sold all their bitcoin, the price would plummet- ie; a ponzi scheme.  Are they going to do it? I don't know, but chances are greater that the top 100 wallets will take the tens of millions over the ideology, and if they do, and the price dies hard, the confidence will die with it.

I hope you're right.  The catch-22 is that to grow it it needs publicity, which Bitcoin gets now because of the speculators.

Whose going to make it recover?  Despite what my responses here may seem to imply I like Bitcoin, but I think we are of the minority, and most people involved just want money, and if they don't think they can make money there will be hardly anyone talking about it anymore.

The point was that escrow will charge fees, which means you lose one of the biggest advantages of bitcoin, so now you have a double fee, the transaction fee and the escrow fee
As for reputation, you're thinking too provincially, as a whole, if merchants know people can not hold a charge, there are less incentives than now to make sure your product is in good condition.  Right now companies have two incentives, one is reputation, and the other not getting paid. Two incentives are better then one. 
If those people dropped all their coins it wouldn't just be a big mess it would end the entire experiment.

My point about the ponzi scheme was ECB cannot declare that it's not one, you don't know if it is until you see what those top wallets do.  A ponzi scheme is created by the majority holders intention and we don't know yet what their intention is, and neither does the ECB.
For every seller there is a buyer until there isn't, that's why the price drops- more sellers then buyers.
The point of the chargebacks is the power to do it creates a deterrence, an additional incentive for shipping standards, and that addition incentive goes away, obviously reputation incentives are still there, but more incentive is better than less.

You have a misconception about who the "we" are.  The vast majority of traders now are people looking to make money and get out, not people who care about bitcoin.  If it dropped from 800-10 those people would leave.  And the few people left who actually care would not sustain the system.
