Typically a bitcoin processor will immediately send a transaction through and cover any losses which result from not waiting for a full confirmation. This "fixes" the delay problem when using Bitcoin for online transactions.

Purchased a logitech proteus to replace my mouse. No trouble whatsoever during payment, literally 3 clicks from the payment screen (open multibit, click send, confirm send) and I'm through.
One very minor complaint I do have is that the transaction receipt from bitpay doesn't list detailed information, it basically just says "hey you paid btc for something!".

Cue awkward smalltalk
"Hey, could've been worse right? Could've lost it to PonziCoin hahaaa....ahem.....mhm....."

Damn that's a smooth loop...

Interesting...hopefully they can do what I want

Wait something happened to what.cd?

Namely because their Interkassa portal, which is key for me to wire USD, is in Russian. And only russian. Their secondary method OKPAY uses even sketchier payment intermediaries to facilitate the bank wire. Additionally their website doesn't seem to track my login status completely...and will randomly log me out. BitInstant, the only legitimate seeming funding source, doesn't accept bank transfer...

I just want an US exchange to take my moneeeeeyyyy...I never thought I'd have such a hard time finding someone who will....MTGOX seems to be my only option...but the anti-MTGOX circlejerk!

Interestingly enough my bank won't accept their IBAN....working on that one...
However there's also the forex fee for an outbound international wire....is there a US exchange that isn't total crap?

Be that as it may, for the duration of my BTC foray I'd prefer no one to know my SSN except my bank. It seems an unnecessary risk when I'm trying to acquire a currency touted as fairly anonymous.

Bit instant doesn't appear to accept wire transfer, and I'd prefer to avoid using money gram. I just want to make a wire transfer to a US based exchange.

Okay, well even ignoring that issue, coinbase doesn't seem to be able to ensure instant purchasing of bitcoins (max limit?), and I've heard horror stories about them placing holds on bitcoin transactions.

Ditto....I've gone through about 4-5 different exchanges only to be hampered and inconvenienced....I JUST WANT TO WIRE TRANSFER MONEY
MTGOX is getting all the hate right now, and wiring them money is ridiculously expensive in small quantities with the forex fees.
BTC-E is sketchy as hell...their website stops working at random and their payment solutions are in other languages...
Coinbase has been the focus of several security issues, and just yesterday announced another breach.
Bitstamp has also had security issues, and there have been reports that the exchange will randomly halt transactions and withhold account balance.
CampBX requires me to use dwolla to get cash in, and that also requires giving my SSN to some random site on the internet to verify...yeah no thanks.
Bitfloor has had wire transfers to it suspended by my bank for fraudulent activities after they you know...collapsed the last time.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM MEEEEE...SHUT UP AND TAKE MY USD PLZ
