oh no, I just earned a crazy profit and now the fees are too much, how could I ever use bitcoin?
oh no, i just bought in and now it's dropping, this tiny bubble is nothing compared to past corrections. but I can't stand it.
oh no, I just bought some as a short term investment and not a long term one, now it costs a lot to take out.
oh no, I cant wait a day for a transaction to go through because miners wont pick up sub $15 transaction fees, I should look at alts instead of being patient or upping my tx fee since it's so important.
oh no, I don't want to reinvest in the system I am profiting from and create a node to help confirm transactions.
If you aren't willing to be a part of the development in this decentralized economy, I'd suggest you stick with your fiat and hodl that instead.

The current minimum transaction fee for transactions to be included in blocks within the next 24 hours is 120-130 sat/byte.  Since the median transaction size is 226 bytes, this equates to 29380 satoshis, or at 15507.81 USD, 4.6 USD dollars.
For a purchase to be competitive to credit cards (3%), and the merchant willing to wait 24 hours for a transaction to be admitted into the blockchain, your transaction fee should only be 2% of the total purchase.
To get the most value of a transaction, you would need to spend $250 USD, or 0.01622346 BTC.  This is why steam does not want to use it anymore, but should still be an extremely viable purchasing solution for orders over 250 USD.

I did my first 2 buys for ~.2 btc @ 1260USD.  I remember thinking about btc when it was 1btc for $12 when I had no money.  Let's see how it goes.

1. Will announce
2.  People will buy and sell
3.  People will continue to use bitcoin at whatever price due to trust in the system
4.  Price will continue to be subject to supply and demand.

I think we're going to see more companies opening up their own bitcoin exchanges with the ability to buy/transfer/store/(probablynot)sell bitcoin.  with their trust backed by their service/product.  I don't think it would be hard to implement, just about any corporation that wants bitcoin will go through the effort to adding an additional payment type.
As for 'opening up their own bitcoin exchanges', you already see companies have user accounts with balances and the ability to purchase credits for their products, including via giftcards.

At least he admits that he doesn't understand the value of bitcoin.  Hopefully he'll do a bit more research on the tech behind bitcoin and see how efficient it actually is, i.e. doesn't take a government to run.

Bitcoin is a crypto-currency which users worldwide can create secure transactions electronically to a decentralized ledger, control their hard-earned money, and verify transactions online.
Unlike other currencies, it is not backed by a government so centralized bodies are unable to create adverse fiscal policies.  There is a permanent, fixed maximum amount of bitcoin so no new coins may be created to reduce its value.

I think the answer to your question is largely dependent on how much current bitcoin owners own.  Just some rough estimates based on u/allyougottado's link, it seems that there are about 11808311 addresses total with some money, with only 350,000 at &gt;= 2 BTC.  That would make &gt;= 2BTC owners the top 2.9%. Very rough though, as it numbers have been rounded and defunct &amp; dead wallets are included.
tl;dr: 2+BTC = top 3% of BTC owners.

I agree, UASF BIP148 would be the way to go, and by owning a node, you would be chipping away that hashing power.  The reason I am appealing to sellers is because they have experienced using bitcoin in the short-run, whether it is by stock or purchases (considering USD for bitcoin as a purchase), why not truly invest long term in the currency that they have previously entrusted?  Why not increase the trust of the currency they and continue to benefit from?

Continue to establish regular markets that will receive payment primarily in bitcoin, either by incentivizing the payment in BTC or penalize the physical currencies.  This can be done by selling online or by having an always-online POS that become an economic node.

I think that the rest of the community leaves, because nothing is keeping them from staying.  Sure people here and there might lose some money, but they aren't tied to it the way we are tied to fiat.  If their end goal is to make fiat by means of cryptocurrency, then that's fine, they figured out the game.  If the end goal to become a hashing power majority is possible, who cares if everyone else left?

They're afraid of bank runs when fully utilized cryptocurrencies could create a currency run.

That sounds like a fundamental misunderstanding of what bitcoin is about.
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:48:27
think of it as a short term correction over a long term correction.  We're all trying to realize the value of bitcoin as many factors come into play (such as new countries/entities, policy, currency balance, buy/sell), you'll see the continual growth of the cryptocurrency.  
Price drop can be attributed to one thing - people taking out value from bitcoin.  So there are people that sell all or some.
If they sold all, that means they don't believe in bitcoin as much as alt-coins, fiat, etc..., or are trying to play the high-low of short-term exchange.
If they sold some, that means the sellers realize the value, and will continue to hold their remaining btc, or sell later when they believe that bitcoin has matured further

If you've been in btc for a year, you're still up 250+%.  A bunch of people trying to regulate an unregulatable market, and a bunch of people seeing BTC as an investment vehicle, not a replacement for fiat.  The reason it hasn't replaced fiat is because of high transaction costs keeping it from being as liquid as we'd like.  In order to reduce transaction costs, people are trying to figure out the best way to lower them. Since there are many different ideas on how to go about this, there seems to be disagreement within the btc community.

The people selling are giving others a chance to adopt bitcoin at a cheaper price, allowing them to use it in place of whatever national currency they need to use.  The more people we get to adopt the decentralized currency, the better.  People need to get it out of their head that a nations' currency is primary and bitcoin is secondary.
