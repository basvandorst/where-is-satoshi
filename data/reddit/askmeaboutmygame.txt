Beyond getting a hardware key, which at this point is out of reach for me. Is there a more secure method?  Thanks

I always thought HODL would sound like Hodor when said out loud so I made Hodor Hodling ~

Looks like the value is already back on the rise so that's good to see already after 24 hours. Hopefully this trend continues, as a new investor this week was crazy to watch but it sounds like it going to be somewhat common until Bitcoin becomes more mature of a currency . So all in all it's kind of fun to watch and Hodl.

Any insight on when the difficulty will stop the price drop?  Everyone is saying Bitcoin is now worth more to mine but the price is continuing to go down, will this be seen in a day or a few days? Weeks?
