but the emails are out there too, which makes me unhappy.

you do not need software open at the time, the transaction is broadcast by the person sending you the money and recorded by others.  In fact, you can go to blockexplorer and see it there prior to it showing up on your local client if you want to instant confirm without waiting for your client to catch up on the latest blockchain.

I'm waiting for some tools to come in from my apiary supplier to make my existing honey stock into creamed honey, to help the honey keep for longer (+ yum spread it on toast), but I will post it to reddit/bitmarket for sure when I have more available.  I'm also trying my hand at some mead, but I don't want to get involved with liquor sales at this point.  
I'm just a small time enthusiast for digital currency and beekeeping, so only sell when I have stock on hand.  I would however to be happy to PM you when I have another harvest later this year or get my creamed honey worked out. :-)

As an aside, if you price your good in bitcoin, you can skip step 2. I do this because I sell according to the season and set a price for the product  (honey) at the start of the season using costs and supplies and an estimate for the rate over a period of time, only a few months or so per batch. 
This sets a static price in bitcoin that everyone purchasing the same thing pays, wether or not the fiat value fluctuated slightly during that period. I am also converting my supply chain (hive bodies, extraction costs) to accepting bitcoin for payment as well, so I can keep it all within the bitcoin economy.

Thank you for the details, this kind of thing should be more widely known.

Lets see if I get this right...
Cause honey IS magical ;)

The honey does keep forever, it's true! However, fresh honey that has not been filtered or heat treated is prone to solidifying and crystalizing over time. Consumers generally prefer the honey to be clear or at least liquid and although it is possible to restore it by gently warming it, it is generally best to keep honey that you intend to sell liquid and motive. My large buckets from last harvest are showing some crystallizing activity, so I'm going to convert it to creamed to preserve the look and marketability.

Try Bitminter.com, it uses a Java (jnlp) file to do all the hard setup for you, including using your installed video card which will mine faster than your CPU.
  It also does you the favor of showing what your expected rate of "minting" is, so you can decide if its worth it or not after a day. Its not a bad way to get a few bit-cents into a wallet to get the idea and decide if you want to invest more in a direct fashion.

ahem. I've been trading honey for bitcoin via reddit since 2011. There never was any such monopoly   ;-)
But as it is a fundamentally constrained supply (beekeeping is hard) there's always lots and lots of room for more people trading person to person what they have. Anyone trading for bitcoin is good news for early adopters. 
Hooray for Denver!

Here, I'll send you a $1 donation for good karma. Going to do it directly via web wallet instead of bitcointip bot although that would be ideal.
