Intrinsic value traditionally defined was not the correct term. But I think that saying that bitcoin or other crypto-assets don't have a fundamental financial value is incorrect, Its more complex. Valuation of crypto-assets is hotly debated.
Bitcoin is both a currency and the key infrastructural component of a digital payment network ( think decentralized version of Paypal, Western union or a digital bank). The value of the payment network remains definable even if its structurally and politically decentralized.
Bitcoin generates bitcoin to compensate for its costs of production and its mechanism of storage and transportation. The payment network can be used for a variety of services that piggy back onto bitcoin transactions. The value of Bitcoin scales with the transactional demand for its payment network.
Once we figure out how to assess the value of the payment network in relation its costs and its competitive forces, we can then have a better idea of the current value, and make projections for the future.

The winning iteration might come from a fork or an ALT tho.

Bitcoin is valued by network effect, transaction volume etc... 
It definitely has quantifiable value as there is still demand for it and its value increases with the network size. Bitcoin floor value might be $.50, $5, $500, $5000,... Finding that value is the hard part because fundamental analysis of crypto is still an art and defining intrinsic value is risky.
