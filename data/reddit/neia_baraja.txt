Haha, I actually already found that website from a quick google search. Instead of just giving you the info to use the card though (the numbers on the front, the 3 numbers on the back, the expiration date, etc) it ships it to you. One of the reasons I'm using Bitcoin is so I can remain anonymous with most of my money and keep the government from tracking it (except for any money I make at my job because... well... taxes. I'm looking to buy the info for the card online, then to proceed to use it to buy cold hard psychical cash and ship it to me. So that website won't work unless it directly just gives me the info.

Where can I purchase a Visa with Bitcoins?

It seems to have a lot of videos about different aspects of bitcoin, and is more about investment. The examples I put weren't directed toward that, and to watch all his videos is 10 hours+. I'm talking just a couple hours of the things I want to learn which I mentioned above. I'm sorry but it isn't what I'm looking for. I'd rather either an entire video dedicated to the subject or a part 1 part 2 part 3 each 20-30 minutes kind of deal. I'm sorry if this comes out a being picky or choosey, but it just isn't what I'm looking for.

I know it does the "Note:" part. That's just a note because I want that to stick with another application. If you're saying that other things beyond the Note extend to Cash App than you'd be wrong I believe. If you are right then please tell me how to do those things. Basically, I want something that accepts bitcoin from other wallets and allows me to use them like it's PayPal. Unconnected to an account, and allows me to buy online things without a bank account not just restricted to bitcoin. Basically converting my bitcoin into something like Venmo or Cash-App or PayPal that can purchase stuff online without needing a bank account.

Yeah, that wouldn't be very helpful, however, if I could by cold hard cash from Amazon and they'd ship it to me, then that'd actually fix my problem. Does Moon work with most websites? Some websites deliver cash directly to you (you buy them online and it ships money to your address but takes a bit off the top) but none except bitcoin. 90% accept PayPal though. If the Moon Chrome Extention works on most websites than that might solve my problem. (the reason I'm wanting to convert it to PayPal is so I can buy those).

It seems to be fake... the twitter account is staged.

Okay. Where can I buy the silver coins? I know you're being sarcastic but that's actually what I'm looking for. A place to buy money with PayPal and have them delivered, coin form or not.

I mean like Physical money in my hand, not online.
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:45:30
Like Physical money.
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:43:01
I know. I mean like can I turn it into physical money? Like not online. I don't trust the government and online purchases and want to have my money in my hands.

I don't trust banks. Simple as that. Obviously, if I could do that I wouldn't be asking this questions.
