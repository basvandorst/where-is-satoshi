the unsystem server fund goes to darkwallet servers and is a normal address starting with 1, so if you must use old wallet software, you can donate here:

there are plans to make the dark wallet a SPV client on the bitcoin network, mostly to check that servers are telling the truth

I don't "own" any, but I'm in charge of operating several of them. Can confirm what and have said. PAIN IN THE ASS. DON'T BUY until their sort their software out. It's a shame setting a couple of them up for a bitcoin meetup and have them displaying the dreaded "We ran out of bitcoins" message when there are BTC loaded in them.
Also, since the code in the machine is not open source, the community or the operators can't do anything about it. Software wise, the machine belongs to Lamassu.
again, don't buy!

testnet gateway was down.  it's back up now!

it is as secure as any desktop app. websites and other chrome extensions can't really mess with it, as it's sandboxed. other extensions (like that doge ticker) can still fuck you over by spoofing addresses shown on websites, so be careful.

obelisk servers use the existing bitcoin network.

What's so difficult about it? you just send to a stealth address the way you'd send to a bitcoin address.

Stop talking shit. Amir has been making amazing bitcoin software over the last 2 years... what have you done?
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:58:57
Look at the commit activity. I'd say there's coding going on almost 24/7... 
@_date: 2014-04-25 15:31:46
we are very busy developing the dark wallet and this will be like that for a long time, dark market was a proof of concept that Amir and co. made to:
* a) prove it could be done
* b) win the $20k first prize from the hackaton by coding for a couple of days
It's not ready for production use and we aren't thinking about finishing it for the time being, so please feel free to:
* Take the code and finish it. Make it look and work nicely.
* Call it whatever the fuck you guys want, seriously.


lol, seriously. the effort on behalf of unsystem is done, go and do your part!

yeah, you're doing it wrong. load your darkwallet from other wallet using a normal bitcoin address. Then use stealth when sending to other darkwallets.

we don't like google either. we developed it on chromium, the open source version of chrome. the final release will be in firefox as well.

Electrum is cool but even them incorporated as a company recently. All of the others are VC backed companies (bitpay, armory, hive) or mantained by rich people furthering their self-interest, like mike hearn with bitcoinj or the foundation with the Core.
Unsystem and darkwallet/libbitcoin are explicitly refusing any investor money and asking for donations instead, so the software doesn't get affected by 3rd party interests.
