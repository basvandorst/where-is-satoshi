It is my opinion that anyone who bought bitcoin at any point without doing research was foolish. It’s never smart to buy a commodity when it’s at it’s all-time highest value unless you plan to hold it for long enough for the inevitable correction to come and go.

I’ve heard that anything better than 6K by February is still overall growth beyond the moving average. The hype pumped the price and now it’s correcting. We good.

Perhaps in the short term, but the 6K I’m referring to is the LOW point it would hit and still be keeping up with the average growth. Look I’m no expert, but keep faith.

Yes.

HODL and buy more. Average down, don’t sell low.

Nothing wrong with ripple yo, you just can’t trade it on CB.

No worries I’m watching it like a hawk

That’s what I’m hoping will happen, I was surprised to see it rise today but hopefully it will dip down a bit soon
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:34
Yeah, the day it inevitably dips after a huge surge? The overall trend suggests it will recover soon.

Too bad the article is written so unprofessionally, otherwise I’d share it.

Haha probably. Amazon on the other hand is over $1100 I believe, or close to it
