Its a valid point but just think of companies like this as data points on an adoption curve. The more the merrier, and if you suddenly have a bitcoin burning a hole in your pocket you might just find yourself a customer at Barnes &amp; Noble or J.C. Penney like the rest of us.
Accepting Bitcoin will never completely set your company apart from competition or save it but it is at least one more tool in your swiss army knife.

Went to a Bitcoin conference in NYC and some guy invited me to the Bitcoin Center. I thought, sure why not that would be cool to check out, I didn't realize it would be a bait and switch where they would try to convince me to invest in their Dogecoin mining company. I felt extremely uncomfortable and the guy who founded the place gave me the creeps.

He's talking out of his ass, the few bought politicians he employs have assured him that they will do everything within their power to keep JP Morgan strong...what he and they don't realize or don't want to admit is that it's not within their power to stop Bitcoin. They will have to spend and spend and spend to physically shut down just a few Bitcoin companies/exchanges...who can then copy and paste their code to run on new servers abroad.  Bitcoin has effectively turned money into nothing more than information, we're in the Information Age for God's sake. You can't stop information with paper the same way you couldn't stop Iron with Stone. Jamie is that kid who yells and screams how he's going to beat you up in front of the whole school or worse that his older brother the Government will do it...it'll turn out he doesn't know how to throw a punch.

Being able to rattle off talking a points without actually discussing anything worthwhile doesn't make you an incredible speaker in my opinion. This guy uses double speak like any politician fearful that people will eventually see through them. Apart from the chair he is sitting in there's little else indicating he's the smartest guy in the room.

All digital currencies are based on their use as stores of value...speculation serves to help discover pricing. Bitcoin has first mover advantage, network effect and ultimately stickiness. Ask yourself what competitive advantages do these other coins have and how long will they be around for...I don't see much of a need for them if Bitcoin can be broken down into so many decimal places and denominations. The economic infrastructure and intellectual property built on top of the bitcoin network has value that the Altcoins in my opinion can't touch. I own BTC and LTC but I'm much more bullish toward BTC.

I believe that someone intelligent enough to design this system would have a greater plan for his wealth than to just hoard it. It is possible that when the bitcoin economy has taken a large enough share of the worlds wealth storage that Satoshi might give his coins to the less fortunate in the 3rd world and help to create a more equal society. He could also build an ASIC robot army to enslave us all.

I don't see why this idea would "technically" be a bond. I'm forecasting dividends, not specifying period payments and a balloon payment at the end...As far as filing with the SEC goes this is just a friendly conversation on the internet with fellow bitcoin enthusiasts, we're not official. I think when you combine the JOBS act and Bitcoin you open up to a very new type of fundraising. Bitcoin has the ability to greatly reduce the friction it takes for new businesses to fundraise, and I'm confident it will eventually shake the very foundation of the SEC. SBA loans are still loans and the government will never be a Maven for your brand like a carefully chosen investor would. I've been successful raising capital through Kickstarter before and my backers consisted mostly of friends and family. What I am exploring doing here is different. Just like Bitcoin is still very much an experiment so too is this idea. When I look at Bitcoin I don't just see the price or even the protocol but the network of Bitcoiners that make it work. Each Bitcoiner has social capital that they attach to their purchases and a reason to evangelize businesses that are a part of the Bitcoin economy. It is too early to estimate but if you could put a value on that social capital in terms of its usefulness to a fledging craft beer brand it is beyond huge.

Bitcoin is not meant to "feel safe" it was never designed to be like that. The U.S dollar is manipulated to feel safe and to hide the fact from those who hold it that it is increasingly leeching out of their bank account and into the hands of the banks and well connected few. Bitcoin is volatile because it is completely transparent, people react and exaggerate price swings when one large player enters or leaves the market. As the market cap grows and more of the whales cash out the market will naturally stabilize. Without a central issuance authority people are more aware of their currency risk but that doesn't mean that one currency is any safer than the other. You could argue that based on the value of BTC against USD against RMB over the last 5 years, BTC is far an away the "safest" of them all. I for one love the design of BTC economy and have more faith in it than the USD.

Imagine the ability to send financial aid to hurricane victims or those threatened with disease almost directly and instantaneously. The current "non profit" system for charity is beyond broken it is corrupt. It takes weeks, months and sometimes years for funds to see victims and by then much of it has been skimmed or given in contracts to shell corporations for bloated sums.
I could go on forever about the benefits that we will see as a result but the most simple is that it will redirect where the worlds best brains go after college. The smartest person in the class might choose to focus on medicine or technology or art or maybe they will write a book instead of going into banking because "that is where the money is". There will always be bankers but not like their are now...society will be able to focus on the things that advance us rather than seek self interest.

You need to think in terms of %'s and not prices. It is a fallacy that just because something is more expensive means it has less potential to increase in value. Human history has short memory so look at Microsoft's growth as an example, not of what is normal but of what is possible.

TLDW; Humans are evolutionary predisposed to be more fearful of losing what we already have than we are to losing out on all else equal future gains. Evidence as to why so many people wait to buy BTC but are in a rush to sell as soon as they think the market might be crashing.

I know exactly how saturated the market is, I'm glad you brought it up. I worked as the Sales Manager for NYC's second largest craft brand and saw them from draft only to market dominance. The strategy I'm proposing to take is a bit different than what any of the new entrants are doing, not to mention I have a great deal of existing relationships within the industry and with buyers of some of the largest accounts in the city. I would be running the company extremely lean to start, most likely gypsy brewing, doing viral video marketing and direct selling to accounts myself. I'm very confident I have what it takes to be successful at sailing my own ship in this industry...also keep in mind how quickly major brands are loosing market share to Craft. Yes the space is getting crowded but it is also getting bigger and there are still large areas in NYC, Westchester and Long Island that are untouched by craft.
