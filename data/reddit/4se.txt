If the exchange or the government thinks you're withdrawing many small quantities to get around a check you'd get if you withdrew a larger sum, then you will end up getting caught and having to deal with a lot more headaches than if you just did one transaction.

Anyone holding tether would lose their money, and their ability to buy crypto if it drops below a certain price.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:55:43
But then why bother withdrawing small quantities? 
If everything is legit you should just ask for 500k not 10k 50 times. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:14:08
Yeah you understand the fundamentals of day trading. I think crypto is a dumb thing to day trade because you are flipping a coin, paying fees on top of that and have the risk of it crashing to zero at any moment. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:21:26
If you’re looking to day trade something that you like long term don’t. 
You’ll take profits when it’s up 1000 only to watch it continue to rise another 7000 while you sit on the side lines because you thought it was peaking. 
I think the other guy is right. Buy slowly over time to average out what you pay. Hopefully more than $20 per month especially if you don’t pay % fees. 
If you think it’s going to crash and it’s peaking sell half in case it continues to go up. If you think it’s at its lowest go in slowly in case it continues to decrease.

Buying at 9000 is for suckers. It will drop to exactly 7235, buy then 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:20:23
You can lose money because it may never reach the all time high again, I’m may drop immediately after you buy.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:04:48
Well the fact that society on a whole would probably fall apart and render bitcoins pointless long before we add another USA size energy consumer in the world.

No I meant cash money cash

If the company won’t pay you in the best of times, why would it pay you when it’s about to go bankrupt and has nothing more to lose?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:23:50
If you don’t want to pay to make a transaction you can use cash
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:22:16
This is definitely an advertisement 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:30:57
Don’t feel bad. That’s totally not the reason why you won’t invent something as important as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:07:53
Well there is only so much power humanity can use and we are probably already using too much. If we all switch over to a form of currency that uses as much power as bitcoin does, then humanity will probably be spending so much energy to maintain the energy infrastructure that it all crumbles.
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:22:51
It means you paid in a lot of pieces of coins
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:21:19
But what would happen if the info on your coins was lost to the part that got pruned?
What if the people creating the algorithms just topped up their accounts to 100 million coins every year?
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:51:15
It’ll probably go through but why put money in bitcoin you can’t afford to lose for a few days?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:50
They need to make sure that they have the cash to pay you. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:17:31
Yeah, if you had to pay $50 in tax, and the value of the dollar doubled, the value of the $50 in tax you owed would also double.

And so is bitcoin

Internet 2.0 was social media
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:41:02
All the problems bitcoin has now bitcoin cash would have if many people were using as far as I know. 
Honestly crypto currencies are best used for extremely high risk speculative investments. 
You can also go by the noble cause of fighting against fiat currencies but that is like buying the first electric cars. They are worse value than normal cars but someone has to sacrifice himself for the technology to grow and become actually worthwhile from a financial standpoint
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:28:52
Well it going to lower than one cent and staying there while another more promising asset continues to increase would probably change how people feel about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:37:21
Please organize it and tell me when. I'll buy some bitcoin 1 minute before and sell it one minute after.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:53:50
These people are so dumb I don’t believe it’s a bcash conspiracy. It’s just too stupid
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:43:10
They'll understand the difference.
Government-backed has the support of 300+ million people in the US. 
Decentralized has the support of a few hundred thousand people.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:38:36
If it's backed by actual ownership of the building, then it's way less of a shitcoin than bitcoin is
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:50:37
If visa found out then they would be screwed. They'd be lucky to just lose the ability to accept credit cards.
@_date: 2018-03-05 20:00:53
Why not just force them to sell their BCash to buy Fiat to pay you with? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:19:56
You should try to withdraw it using live coins procedure for withdrawing. They are more likely swamped with requests than insolvent. 
That being said. The miners are probably withdrawing money every day and doing it in a way that doesn’t affect the price of bitcoin. So the market value is definitely higher than the amount people will be able to withdraw from exchanges. 
It may come down to needing to find a real person willing to buy your bitcoin but not yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:24:19
It's literally what every pessimistic person has been saying about bitcoin.
If you can't afford a 100% correction down to zero then you invested too much.

Use the formula to calculate compounding dollars but put in the number of satoshis instead

Well he probably doesn’t want them anymore

It’s more like saying bitcoin is more popular than the US dollar in Canada
I’m a Canadian btw

@_date: 2018-02-01 18:54:15
Go back in time when people were pouring money into the exchanges so they had cash to give out and hope they eventually got to you in the line of hundreds of people.
@_date: 2018-03-11 20:18:28
Because you can eat bitcoin
