Gambling to make more isn't exactly the same as spending. When I spend cash on hamburger meat I don't do it so I can dig around in the meat in hopes of finding more cash.

I wonder what their daily bitcoin sales are not going to be. Maybe you should email them again and tell them to install bitcoin miners in all of their lamps, then maybe bitcoiners will actually buy from them.

Anybody got any BFL Singles they want to get rid of? I'll give you $250 a piece for them. It's not like they're going to be worth much in a couple of months anyway. Once the difficulty level goes to 1 billion and bitcoin is trading in the $1-$150 range, you wouldn't be able to make enough money mining to pay attention let alone pay any kind of bills or retire on a beach.
So, what do you say, $250 each for your BFL Singles?
