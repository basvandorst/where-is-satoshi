how do i make these wallets i looked in the app and nothing. Is it something i can do in the website? Also I understand the wallets are not mine but the bitcoin is right?

I just started (like literally yesterday) so any advice? I should have a separate wallet?
Coin bade is where i but of course.

How can i secure my Bitcoin after buying from coin base? I read the it and i Ike the hardware option the best but need other input. If i use the Android app recommended here is it stored on my device or on servers? 
Also i agree coinbase is easiest for beginers. Just how i started yesterday!

What really do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:02:31
is there an app for coinbase wallet or is it the coinbase app where you buy and sell itself a wallet? Also where do i get my private key? Sorry im still learning but made a plung while it was low somewhat...

how much is small amounts? Like $100's or less or more? i stupidly bought $700 right now since i had the money laying around lol. Already learned my first lesson. Still learning about it but might as well make the jump now!
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:05:45
and i thought my 6500 was bad lol.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:10:33
Yea learned that just now.. of well we'll do that from here on out!
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:28:20
If i ever moved them to a hardware wallet for example, do the private keys get turned over to me? 
And just to make sure i understand this correctly, I would need an account(wallet) for USD and a separate for EU correct? I mean i would only ever do transactions in USD but just asking. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:06:16
i learnt that as well. $700 of 6500 market price :/
