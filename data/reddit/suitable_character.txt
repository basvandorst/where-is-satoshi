I have rich friends and they all file requests for 500+. Not only they are richer than me, but since they have kids, I have to pay my taxes (in part) for their kids.
I have nothing against social aids for poorer people, but I don't like the fact that my taxes are routed for richer people than me. Also as you've said, I don't think rich people would be interested in 500+ if it weren't there; that's why I don't think 500+ is designed as an aid for anyone. I think it was designed as a bribe for the people to vote for the party, and in the process some people benefit from it (and some people are losing; like in all social wealth redistribution systems)

Nah, it's thanks to 500+, a government plan to throw money at people

I was tempted to reply that you don't see how, but other people can see it, that's why they have a corvette, but the boring reality is that it's just a joke and you can't buy a corvette for 500+. It's a reference to other photos like these:
Another thing is that it's not a program to "support families" since it doesn't impose any limits on family income, so even rich families can benefit from it. It's a program to broaden the electorate and nothing more.
