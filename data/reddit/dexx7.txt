Well, this still makes the reverted chain a hard fork chain.

Ah sorry for not making my point clear. At some places in Germany sellers don't accept cards for low amounts due to the fees, and I assumed this is why people are generally shy to use cards for low amounts.

Hey guys,
I'm maintainer of Omni Core, the reference client of the [Omni Layer]( The Omni Layer is a protocol on top of Bitcoin, created in 2013, which uses Bitcoin transactions to embed additional instructions, which are interpreted by Omni-aware software.
Such instructions can be:
- create an asset
- transfer tokens
- trade tokens
These transactions are most likely transfers from Poloniex, and I agree that this is not very efficient. I layed out a few points on what we have planned to avoid this:
To provide an estimate about our transaction volume: there are currently roughly 100.000 Omni transactions per month with 11.000 transactions on peak days.
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:30:47
If you work in the city though, you have to factor in your way to work and the time spent for doing so. Does it all add up over time?

ERC20 tokens are tradable on decentralized exchanges like EtherDelta. This is usually also the place where ICO tokens are traded, before they hit exchanges.

@_date: 2017-12-13 15:00:18
OP, did they already reach out for extended KYC? Maybe you can talk about this a bit, if they have?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:32:51


Well, this sounds like an exaggeration. Peak transaction volumes are 400,000-500,000 transactions per day, which results in 2.2-2.75 %.
Most transactions are likely sends from and to exchanges.

I think this is an excellent idea, but I'm wondering: if it's unclear how to use git, then I'd assume the scope of potential changes is pretty limited.
I wouldn't consider consensus breaking changes such as "rendering satoshi's coins worthless" as "contribution to Bitcoin Core" though. Maybe something like "add a new RPC call to do x" instead?

As quick follow up question: say a pool with some significant amount of hashrate starts to deploy the replace-by-fee patch, and there are attempts in the wild to double spend unconfirmed transactions via this mechanism. Do you have already any logic in place to handle such an event? Can you think of any other case where the confidence detection may fail from one moment to another? :)

Slightly outdated, but it might be worth to mention that, at some point, more than 50 % of the blockchain consisted of gambling transactions:

Ah, thanks for the answer. Maybe I misunderstood it though: transaction replacement, double spent relaying, and mempool manipulation in general isn't consensus affecting. I mentiones replace-by-fee in particular, because it was claimed that it's deployed by some (very few, I guess) miners, according to some post in the bitcoin dev mailing list.

The website blockchain.info has a feature to associate messages with transactions, but those messages are not stored in any block, and [only visible]( on that website.
There is the [payment protocol]( which allows to transfer off-chain messages between buyers and merchants [...], and it's also possible to attach [some data]( to transactions on a blockchain level, but this doesn't seem really suitable for this purpose.

Channels are one-way, to one receiver. However, multiple channels could be chained. Say A has a channel to B, B has a channel to C, then A could transfer coins to C via B, even without direct connection. There could be nodes with many open channels, which act as intermediate/forwarder.
Unfortunally the channels tie up coins, so opening a lot of channels is probably not that simple in practise. Assuming there is a channel worth of 1 BTC between A and B, and another one worth 1 BTC between B and C, then a total of 2 BTC is locked, even if only a total of 1 BTC could be moved from A to C in this example.

Hey a few minutes ago it was announced that 21 % of the hashing power adopted replace-by-fee, without any requirement for the replacing transaction:
Are you ready for this? Would it be accurate to assume that the confidence factor is now mostly going to be based on "monitoring actual double spend attemps" and putting that in relation, instead of assuming "the more nodes saw a transaction, the more likely a confirmation is going to be"? If so, are there any failsafes in the system to handle a case of "massive double spent attempts"?

I wouldn't necessarily consider it as deal breaker though.
Because only very tiny amounts are transferred satoshi by satoshi, the hub basically can't steal coins,  At worst a malicious intermediate can denial the service and stop forwarding payments, and in this case the refund transactions could be broadcasted, after the lock timed out.
Peter Todd wrote a few more words about payment hubs last year on the dev mailing list:

Sweet idea, but the whole concept of confidence factors for unconfirmed transactions seems vulnerable in an environment, where something like [replace by fee]( exists.
On the other hand, if there is a chance of 5 % for an unconfirmed transaction to be replaced, then those 5 % might be factored into the risk estimation.

It's not really an issue in this case, because even if the donator is unknown, the operator, or more generalized, the one who receives donations usually isn't.
While it wouldn't be possible for the operator to contact the donator, he or she usually still has a chance to reach out and ask for a refund.
In my opinion this is sufficient. 


I'd wait and see, if someone contacts me. Very humble of you by the way, so "thanks for being nice"! :)

I think it's not known which coins belong to Craig.
@_date: 2015-06-08 12:11:46
The idea is that there is a soft cap T (say 3 MB), which can grow to T2 (say 6 MB, or something else). Blocks with a size greater than T are penalized, and miners have to pay a "penalty fee" for greater-than-T blocks.
The "penalty fee" is not burned, but slowly redistributed as bonus on top of the block reward.
If the fees paid by users is high enough, then it makes sense for miners to build penalized blocks nevertheless.
shows in the post I linked in the first post that the penalty mechanism does not incentivize mining centralization, but in fact provide a benefit for smaller miners. Users and miners likewise benefit [in form of higher penalty fee rewards, higher number of accepted transactions at a lower fee], if the demand for transactions is growing.

Imho the superiority of an output based scheme is the ability to do atomic swaps on the BTC &lt;&gt; meta layer out of the box which either succeed or fail. I don't see where "all unconfirmed transactions are roughly equally insecure" comes into play here.

As said, I don't blame you. Going on with the analogy this would probably be similar to a rented apartment with the key below your doormat and you now suspect that the apartment renter conned you. I'm not stupid and I assume most bitcoiners neither. This stuff isn't black and white also, but a constant progress of adjustments. We, the users vs. those, the criminals. If you know that you live in a region with higher criminal rate, you are naturally more careful. This is where we are right now. And of course the villain is the true bad guy and the victim not to blame, but don't you agree that it's probably a good thing that most redditors acted as they did and "called you crazy, because you didn't enable 2FA"? I think it is. Because you and those who joined just at the moment and have no clue as you did will learn one thing: be cautious. In that sense your mindset is healthy, too. You actually should ask the question: "is gox legit?" -- Though it's foolish to say "gox did this, it's not my fault!" without even considering that your device got compromised and you are not yet aware of that. I'm kinda sorry that we are not yet at the stage where no one needs to be aware of those things. In a more general context this comes down to one thing: your own responsibility. It's up to you, who you trust and it's up to you, how you handle your own security. And those who are sloppy or simply didn't know better get punished quickly. :/

It's not encrypted and anonymous is probably the wrong word here. I think you're looking for pseudonymous or so. Everyone can see what happens, which transactions there are, which addresses are used, ... though it's a different story to know who did what.


How does that relate to stability (or low transaction fees)? Lower costs are a secondary effect due to the nature P2P transactions without heavy structures and middle man.

A high enough certainty may not be high enough, if it's crucial that all messages are available to restore the last state. Maybe this is the flaw itself and I need to start thinking about more stateless ways. I'm referring to things like XCP and MSC and not general data. Each "balance" is determined by the chain of previous involved transactions. Even if you enforce that DHT participants don't forget data this is still no guarantee that it's always and ever available as in the case of blockchain storage.

The payouts for no are now are 1:38 by the way. edit: there might be an exploit, if the payouts are indeed locked and recalculated after each bet.

The third party doesn't necessarily need to be trustworthy, as long as the data is verifiable, e.g. by making sure a given transaction is indeed part of a block and the block is legit (chain of headers, assumptions based on difficulty and nonce etc.) -- but I think I see a problem: while it's not required that a third party never lies, it might be a problem, if the third party witholds information.

Unsophisticated malware scans your drive for a wallet.dat and tries to steal it. More sophisticated malware does the same, but may also log your keyboard input to grap your decryption password when you unlock the wallet. (...) Please note: monitoring user input is by far not the only attack vector and while the wallet is unlocked, the wallet has to be somehow and somewhere in an unencrypted state.
There was actually indeed at least one case where a sample of malware was found which replaced the payment recipient right on the fly in memory:
The baseline is this: whenever there is some money on the table, rather sooner or later someone will come and try to grap it. Bitcoin is a perfect target due to it's nature.

It's really up to you and you are the only one who should make this decision.
But one thing is clear: whenever there is uncertainty and panic, prices are most likely way lower then when there is euphoria and optimism.

That's interesting, but I have a hard time to think of a reason. blockchain.info is a pretty well connected node and the transaction is legit. When sent via blockchain.info (or any wallet) the client knows of the transaction. If the client is not connected or there are other reasons why the transcation wouldn't be relayed, it will stay this way.

It would be very interesting to have some kind of watchdog for that bait wallet.dat. I looked at procmon from Microsoft which is capable of logging file access, but it's way to resource hungry, I guess. Relying on the possibility that the attacker empties the wallet is probably not the best solution. Say there are only a few bitcents in it. If I were the attacker, I'd wait till some serious amounts hit the wallet and empty it then.

Hehe, very odd, but indeed interesting question.
One approach is to use an external entity that provides information about *something*, for example: *today's date is 2014-02-22* or *big_bebop is alive*. These state information would be used in some way to create transactions that are only spendable, if a specific state is given.

Great idea, *but* there is a more direct way to accomplish the goal of getting your tx confirmed: rebroadcast a similar transaction with the fee attached. Basically you initiate a double-spent and the one with fee wins. *"... the Bitcoin network was designed to prevent such things and I don't know if many clients support it"* - that's right and wrong. Your own client will most likely reject the transaction, but it's possible to broadcast them via [blockchain.info]( or [eligius]( for example, *especially* when there is not enough fee attached. :) edit: another way is to mutate the transaction and your own client won't reject the tx. (blog: [malleability - looking at the bytes]( edit 2: to be clear, the idea is awesome anyway! :)

Speaking of, CC and other systems aren't dimensions away here. In both cases not the *whole* blockchain is required, but rather a path between coloring/token issuance and target or the set of transactions that influence state related to the target. Easy it is to follow a trail of outputs, in the worst case all transactions within the system are required -- thus the usage of markers (CNTRPRTY prefix, 1EXoDus output). But another question in this context: is it required to know everything or is it sufficient to know a little less to perform an action?

I'm somewhat involved with Mastercoin, because I like the idea of distributed exchanges, smart property etc. and in the end this probably leads to something more innovative and useful for everyone. I'm extremely thrilled by the idea of the initial purpose of OP_RETURN: storing only a  reference to meta data that is somewhere else. However, security is not the only thing that the blockchain offers: it's also the guarantee that the data is available in the future. This is a very significant property that is not given by an external storage like a DHT. If you come up with a solution then please contribute, instead of shouting "abuse" and such.

It's a multi step process on-chain of publishing an offer *("I want to sell 10 XCP for 1 BTC and anyone who likes to purchase those tokens shall publish a reservation followed by a payment within less than 15 blocks")*, a reserveration *("I want to buy 10 of those 10 XCP for 1 BTC")* and the actual payment within the given time frame. A meta &lt;&gt; meta trade is more frictionless though.
In contrast I was referring to a scheme where Alice prepares a transaction with a colored input and a payment output to herself where output sum &gt; input sum, signed with SIGHASH_SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY which can be handled off-chain and finalized by providing further inputs with sufficient amounts and a destination, signed by SIGHASH_ALL.

This is wrong and ~~should get fired~~ (**edit:** he shouldn't), if he didn't object. It's perfectly fine to use an output from an unconfirmed transaction, especially if you know, you were the sender. All of them will very likely confirm within the same block. The *only* potential problem is malleability which was greatly addresses in v0.9.x.

@_date: 2014-10-10 09:57:11
Thanks for providing the source. It's crucial to see that it's not only a blacklist, but to my understanding:
- no relaying of any bare multisig transaction
- relaying of non-standard transactions
- temporary storage of appearingly parent-less transactions
- changes of transaction prioritisation
- GUI modifications
- introduction of uncommon units of measurement ("Bong-Bitcoins (1,0000 tonal)")
- blacklisting of transactions with certain properties based on a hardcoded list

Do you think Mike Hearn is evil or does he simply do what he does? He really seems to believe in the idea of reverting transactions of "bad actors" or blacklisting. Just some hours ago:


Edit: after thinking about this.. there was also the demand for "more ways to get information about nodes" proposed in the context of "number of total nodes potentially dropping".
Nevertheless I am impressed by some ideas, e.g. micropayment channels (in the case credit goes to him).

I'm amazed by the idea, but I fail to grasp the concept at the moment. Let's assume those are balances:  From my point of view (blue) I would know that my balance is 3, my balance is part of a balance sum of 7 which is part of the global sum of 10.

I'm well aware of this, but what's the relation between a pegged altcoin and making altcoins irrelevant? This is equally contradicting as some other claims such as the statement about sidechains making altcoins irrelevant in the first place. ;)
... I think the point you're trying to make is something like "most altcoins are scam or useless and there are ways to get even better results, if interacted with bitcoin directly" and this is where your bias comes into play and generated a totally different message.
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:27:37
FYI: tried to "scam" BitPay for research and science a few minutes ago, because I was wondering, if there is any protection in place. And there is!
I created and chained two transactions with a very low fee, above the minrelay fee (0.00001 BTC/KB in 0.9.0r2) and below the mintxfee (0.0001 BTC/KB), so that the transaction is broadcasted and relayed accross parts of the network, but most likely not confirmed in the next time. The plan was then to respend the the first output with a higher fee (&gt;= 0.001 BTC) to get this one into a block and invalidate the other. -- BitPay did not accept! :)
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:45:41

It's a very good thing that BitPay is looking for new ways to "spend" their BTC holdings. I assume most BitPay merchants request fiat, thus most incoming coins are likely sold. Time to end this. :)

Great idea actually. I run [mastercoin-faucet.com]( and fighting against abusers is definitely crucial. There are multiple ways to authenticate and you may take a look at it. The authentication via Google was enabled at the very beginning and back then I solely used the uid to identify double-claims, though combined with cookies + IP, but it took only three days until some guy managed to do more than 300 claims with fresh registred accounts in a time span of a few hours. :S

Ah thanks for the details. So the tx basically stays within Gox' own system until the input is confirmed 100 times. That seems not very wise, but in the worst case Gox creates a chain of transactions which take a while to be confirmed.. or am I missing something else?

@_date: 2014-03-10 12:22:25
I'm pretty sure once one sees a Bitcoin option the news will quickly be all over this place here, which probably does indeed skew the results. ;)
The [Chicago Sun-Times]( ([follow up]( tested the water with a dedicated Bitcoin test day. I know that Wikipedia participated in events such as the SOPA/PIPA blackout, so how about something similar, but related to Bitcoin? I'm well aware that this will *very* visible, but so was the blackout. Rising awareness is not necessarily a bad thing. :)
@_date: 2014-12-13 06:55:23
Don't do this. Do not store "data" in addresses. For some better-than-worse solution take a look at  but more appropriate would be the use of OP_RETURN. You may follow a recent discussion about this topic in general here:

Shouldn't be that difficult, at least in theory. Take a few blocks right before a deposit and one or more blocks after a withdrawal was made and then scan for the amount in the block. In case of ambiguousness skip. Starting with high amounts is probably preferred.

@_date: 2014-03-26 09:41:58
True. Hm.. full Bitcoin nodes store the whole chain and not only parts, because they need the whole chain to validate the current state. So a meta protocol that relies on previous transactions and which uses a DHT to store data would also need to implement a chain rather than a pure tx lookup via DHT, is that correct? Or rather: the DHT client would need to enforce that the data is kept in some way.

@_date: 2014-05-12 16:46:03
Ah, now I get your point. I was reading it as "you need to pull 100 % of all Bitcoin transactions". It all depends on what we are talking about in the first place. In that sense you need to fetch all Bitcoin transactions, too, to proof an output was not spent earlier. But let's theory-think about light nodes and take it for granted that transactions in the chain are indeed valid:
The CC equivalent would be "take only the colored branch".
Related to MSC: you need to fetch only a very tiny subset of all transactions and the first filter criteria is the marker output (MSC) or output prefix (XCP). Some implementations do this inefficiently, others [use alternative methods]( filtering via [bloom filters]( may be possible in the future, but that's not yet done. To reconstruct the latest state of the system today, you start to parse and validate every of those which were tagged. I assume this set of transactions can be minimized further by using optimized data structures which only contain the minimal paths and branches for an specific participant.

It would be wise to work together instead of against each other and it's crucial to not act hasty or get emotional.

@_date: 2014-03-16 20:44:59
Actually this concern is very well known by the developers and even [mentioned in the Mastercoin specification]( The wallets currently overpay fees by about 10 % for normal transactions and the whole DOS protection for selling/buying is done by spending about 5x the amount of normal fee to miners. Believe me, miners should love MSC! :)
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:39:35
Well, but the relevant question is: how does step 3 look like in reality? Was there a dumb system in place and users were able to initiate a resend? I hightly doubt that such a system would actively scan the blockchain over and over again to make sure a tx went through and issue new tx, if not.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:53:12
Does current mining software in any way indicate - or could indicate - if a pool behaves malicious? Example: a miner finds a block, the software starts a timer and shuts down or fires an alarm, if the block isn't broadcasted and seen by larger parts of the network within some reasonable limit.

Interesting. A bit of rant nevertheless: you associate piracy with the unwillingness to pay and leeching free content all day long, but I believe this is rather the tip of the iceberg with loads of money movement below. An exclusive service is not for free - and likely worth (so I've been told). I have the impression the key point is rather something else: convenience, quality and fast availability. But the old world seems to catch up with services like Hulu, Netflix and HBO to name. 
The part that raised my eyebrows was where it was basically stated that paywalls are annoying, donations are useless and then a few minutes later you mentioned the awesome "Vitalik Buterin’s content monetization model". Oh well.. Convenience is also a big keyword here.
That being that, I'm curious where this is going to. Cheers and good luck!
Edit: I forgot the most imporant part: every shitty altcoin scam exchange has a "vote with your coins" feature. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:06:23
All good, but maybe you should also consider to look at secondary effects. Say you create a pool with nicer policies like lower fees. Even if miners earn minimal less, miners may also think this is a good thing and join your pool because of this. More miners will allow you to lower pool fees which results in higher income for miners in the end.
I'd be soo happy, if pools would actually shift to a "mine here, because we have this and that Bitcoin feature (fee structure, including non-standard transactions etc.)" model.
@_date: 2014-08-16 21:57:42
While there seems to be a relation between price movement and number of transactions, it actually seems to be the other way around. Also: if I were a day trader, I wouldn't move my coins around, but trade on an exchange.
I put this into perspective and created an album with market price (linear), number of transactions per day (7d avg, linear), number of transactions per day excluding popular addresses (7d avg, linear):

There seems to be the association of pool = centralization = can be abused by pool owner. But nevertheless: a pool is not a single entity per se, but a larger group of miners which follow the lead and mine what they get served to mine.
I was actually wondering: is there any chance to tackle the issue on the client side? Say for example an individual miner finds a nonce sufficient to form a new block, then I would expect the pool, he is contributing to, to announce a new block within very short amount of time after.
But what if this isn't the case? What if no new block is announced within some reasonable time span? Would it be possible for an individual to identify potential misbehavior or unexpected behavior of a pool in general?
I would further think such an individual miner may present proof of his finding to other miners - and assuming it's not rational to participate in misbehavior, then there might be a collective intend to stop contributing further, thus reducing the risk of a bad outcome.

Here is an analogy. Your door is closed and locked, but you keep an emergency key somewhere in your garden for whatever reason. One day you get back home and realize someone used it to gain access. How did that happen? Because sneaky neighborhood kids know that many people hide a key to their door somewhere around. Are you to blame in this case? I don't know, but maybe you'd think about not hiding your key outside, or build a fence around your property. Or maybe you start using two locks at the same time. No doubt though that one should punish the neighborhood kids for stealing.

There is a good chance I misunderstand how it works, and please correct me, if I'm wrong:
    Let A and B be assets or tokens.
    
    Transaction 1:
    In: [10 A, 7 B], Out: [5 A, 5 A, 7 B]
    
    Transaction 2 (spends last output of transaction 1):
    In: [7 B], Out: [7 B]
    
    Transaction 3 (spends last output of transaction 2):
    In: [7 B], Out: [...]
To determine, whether transaction 3 is valid, I'd have to check the history of B tokens *and* A tokens, is that correct? And if there were previous transactions involving tokens other than A and B tokens, their history as well?
If so, it's not just the assets a client receives, but all the assets that were mixed into previous transactions, which seems like a larger scope than those, which may have interacted with via swaps?

In January there was a blog post outlining a different plan:
    1. Current rules if no consensus as measured by block.nVersion supermajority.
    Supermajority defined as: 800 of last 1000 blocks have block.nVersion == 4
    Once supermajority attained, block.nVersion &lt; 4 blocks rejected.
    2. After consensus reached: replace MAX_BLOCK_SIZE with a size calculated
    based on starting at 2^24 bytes (~16.7MB) as of 1 Jan 2015 (block 336,861)
    and doubling every 6*24*365*2 blocks -- about 40% year-on-year growth.
    Stopping after 10 doublings.
    3. The perfect exponential function:
    size = 2^24 * 2^((blocknumber-336,861)/(6*24*365*2))
    ... is approximated using 64-bit-integer math as follows: ...
        double_epoch = 6*24*365*2 = 105120
        (doublings, remainder) = divmod(blocknumber-336861, double_epoch)
        if doublings &gt;= 10 : (doublings, remainder) = (10, 0)
        interpolate = floor ((2^24 &lt;&lt; doublings) * remainder / double_epoch)
        max_block_size = (2^24 &lt;&lt; doublings) + interpolate
    This is a piecewise linear interpolation between doublings, with maximum
    allowed size increasing a little bit every block.

Hi OP,
one could ask me "why didn't you sell your coins", but my focus is on coins, not fiat. It's not nice to see the recent drop, but I don't really care much.

as a signer of the first community letter, as well as the roadmap, I do have a split opinion regarding the moderation policy of In my opinion posts like "Gavin and Coinbase show support for Bitcoin Classic" are equally relevant to this sub as posts about which banks joined R3 CEV, news about Symbiont or whether this or that fiat currency tanked.
Likewise, if there were a post about Litecoin implementing Confidential Transactions, or even something like "IBM creates altcoin; wants a piece of Bitcoin's pie", I would actually welcome it to see here.
In my opinion Gavin and Coinbase play or played a significant role in Bitcoin's history, and if they turn to the dark side, then this may have an impact on Bitcoin's future, in one way or another. This also applies to alternative block size proposals, or pledges to this or that, if a part of the users of this community seemingly stand behind it.

Encoding hashes as addresses and creating unspendable outputs is much more controversial and frowned upon actually, because it does not only take space in blocks, but also space in the UTXO - the unspent transaction output set, which can never be retrieved.
Using OP_RETURN is fine and preferred for those use cases (some would say: the lesser evil). :)

To my knowledge the first larger on-chain protocol was [Mastercoin]( (now [Omni Layer]( in 2013, followed by [Counterparty]( at the very beginning of 2014. Both projects yielded a bunch of significant "crowdsales", such as [MaidSafe]( or [Bitcrystals](

Quite the opposite. Fiat withdrawals were enabled, while BTC withdrawls are disabled. The only way to get off the exchanges was to sell BTC for fiat and moving it via traditional banking system. One might also imagine there is some fiat sitting on the exchanges, waiting to be converted back to BTC and moved off-exchange.

Sure, why not? All goxcoins were held by BB anyway until they were manually withdrawn. Given that it wasn't possible to withdrawal real BTC it's not such a huge difference at all. :) People there are trading "something" that represents a claim for coins on Gox, so to speak. This claim might be worthless, if Gox doesn't offer any compensation, but that's also what the price reflects.

I'd assume there could be exchanges which don't upgrade (and run 1 MB Bitcoin), as well as exchanges which upgraded (and run 2 MB Bitcoin). A user could then make transactions, so he or she has diverging coins on both forks and dump one stack.

It's not clear to me where he's going with this.
For a full node the amount of data to transfer may be similar to the data which would be transferred, if there were a moderate block size increase, assuming SW is used in the wild.
Nevertheless, it *does* provide a capacity increase, similar to a moderate block size increase, and it sounds as if he just handwaves this?

Create a transaction sending to your family with [locktime]( in the future, and hand them over the raw transaction. Once the lock times out, the family can broadcast the transaction. To revoke the lock, the coins can be sent to a new destination.

You can sign the incomplete transaction with ALL|ANYONECANPAY to allow adding more inputs later, or ALL|ANYONECANPAY, if you also want to add more change later. However, you'd then need to pass the incomplete transaction to the other party manually.
I'm not aware to do this fully on-chain without creating a new protocol, e.g. where you embed the incomplete transaction within another transaction as data and then use a client to scan for these.

This is not correct. The transaction might as well land on both chains, if all inputs being spent are older than the split-off block.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:47:59
True, and there is probably one other point to keep in mind: people holding USDT, value money in crypto. They might have parked their money in fiat-on-an-exchange or some other form of fiat, but they decided to use USDT. I would imagine not all of them, who currently convert from USDT to BTC, will sell for fiat on an exchange.

@_date: 2018-06-29 05:43:33
Hi guys, I'm maintainer and developer of Omni Core, the reference client for the Omni Layer.
When retrieving information about Omni Layer transactions, the valid field indicates, whether the transaction is considered valid. An invalid transaction can have multiple causes and it is the case, when the sender crafts a transaction to transfer tokens, even though he or she doesn't have enough balance.
This is no protocol vulnerability, but rather improper handling of incoming token payments, if this was indeed exploited in the wild.
As far as we know, there was an integrator, which hasn't checked the valid flag at all, and simply credited the tokens, without ensuring and checking, whether they were actually transferred.
The reference client of the Omni Layer, Omni Core, doesn't credit any tokens from invalid transactions, while the JSON-RPC API still provides information about such a transaction, but clearly indicates, whether the transaction is valid.
In such a case the result also has an "invalidreason" field, which provides explicit information about why the transaction is considered invalid, e.g. in case of not enough balance.
We published a wiki entry to make other integrators aware of potential pitfalls, when accepting token payments:
@_date: 2016-12-01 10:49:36
Omni and XCP have native tokens, but they are not needed for the creation of new assets or most other features.

As far as I understand the whole situation, these houses are usually flipped or kept as store of value with the intention of selling them later.

@_date: 2017-08-23 14:14:49


This is exactly what I mean.
*Any* transaction which was signed pre-fork (with the old signature hash algorithm) would no longer be considered as valid post-fork.
E.g. say you prepared a transaction before the fork, then it's worthless after the fork.

Until the vote ends, I'd assume cernsorship could be detected, if voters in question reveal their signed transaction and show that it was not mined.
Granted though that this gives miners the ability to humiliate voters by potentially forcing them to do it. If all miners collude, and also ignore censorship proofs, then the vote may be considered as busted.

You failed, and instead presented a biased opinion, which doesn't add anything new to the ongoing discussion. You may have simply published the name of the original poster, which could have lead to an interesting discussion, instead of fueling the fire even more.

So to my understanding the author gained massive speed improvements by using a bloom filter. Sounds impressive, was this done before? To [quote](
**How does Brainflayer work?**
* 1. Download entire blockchain
* 2. Extract all the unique addresses
* 3. Pre-process for high-speed lookups
* 4. Generate candidate passphrases and calculate corresponding addresses
* 5. Check for matching addresses from the blockchain
* 6. Win
**Analyzing the blockchain**
* 80,000,000 BTC addresses
* Bloom filter can check all addresses simultaneously, providing either "no match" or "probable match"
* Second, slower check could identify any false positives

That's pretty harsh. While "the commnuity" may not be able to develop software, the issue you mention isn't caused because "monkeys" are monkeys without ability to make reasonable decisions, but because information may not be communicated in a way that they fully grasp. This seems fixable, and it's probably in the interest of anyone campaigning for a decision.
Though I agree that this in particular isn't a good idea: developers are developers, and they should not waste their time on campaigning.
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:36:53
Actually this is good for SPV clients.
There is a service, ["bloom filters"]( which some implementations provide (Bitcoin Core does btw.), but others don't. The pull request is about adding a service bit to indicate, whether an implementation supports it. SPV clients can then connect to a peer, and check, if the service bit is set, and otherwise disconnect and connect to another peer.

One may argue the community doesn't know what's best for them. I don't necessarily share this opinion though.
Nevertheless, the discussions have to happen either way, to explore all aspects. This process isn't directly related to the actual decision. In the end the developers may be able to influence the outcome, like potentially other vocal participants, but the final choice is up to each user/miner.

Hmm.. correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't really see an improvement.
Case 1:
- a piece of paper with the candidate's name is dropped into a ballot box
- to determine the outcome, all pieces of paper are counted for each candidate
If someone messes up the counting of papers, the results are screwed: during the counting it may be possible to add or remove papers, thus influence the outcome.
Case 2:
- people send some coins to some destination
- a piece of paper with the source of coins is dropped into a ballot box
- to determine the outcome, all pieces of paper are mapped to on-chain transactions, and the matching ones are counted for each candidate
If someone messes up the handling of papers, the results are screwed: during the lookup it may be possible to add or remove papers, thus possible to withhold votes by removing papers, and potentially possible to inject fake votes, by adding papers with coin sources, which were previously used to sent coins to the voting destination.

To quote [page 5 of the original Bitcoin paper](




While this current incident is not so much about malicious nodes, it's effect is basically the same, as there are invalid blocks, which may get picked up by SPV clients.
A compromise is "block pruning": clients still verify blocks and transactions, but keep only the most recent ones. This was [added to Bitcoin Core 0.11](
Edit: a SPV client may have identified the problem *in this case* by checking the outdated block version in the header, but the general issue still applies.
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:29:50


This is no factual lie, but pretty aweful nevertheless.
Due to the human nature (so I've been told) we remember and focus much more on the bad things, than the good ones, so I'd welcome less hype, and more, err.. conservative, projections.
In my opinion, from a consumer's perspective, it's better to underestimate a project than the other way around. If it's all shaky, then there may be a long fall, but without many expecations there is lots of room for "good news" and nice improvements.
@_date: 2015-07-08 19:18:22
Instead of switching the backend, you may just query a Bitcoin Core client and use the command "estimatefee" to get a fee rate estimation for a transaction to confirm within the next n blocks, based on historical transactions. You'd still need to move away from static fees to custom fees though, but this seems like the easiest solution right now imho.

I'm contributor to the Omni/Mastercoin project and recently there was a similar incident: someone sent roughly 780 TetherUS (USD on-chain tokens) to a Coinbase wallet.
The user was in contact with Coinbase and I created a raw transaction to get the tokens back, which would need to be signed by Coinbase. I assumed this would be easier than extracting the private key.
Long story short: the user received exactly the same answer.

Every wallet that I know of takes care of it though, so it's really just a low level detail (and not a fault, but a feature).


That's not the case. Every transaction with fee has a leftover, namely the fee. If you don't "return" a part of the leftover, it's also considered as fee.

I signed the letter, because of the positive sentiment, and not to stand behind any group or person.
I had a bit of trouble to extract the actual message, but what I took from it: "we all deeply care about Bitcoin, and no decision should be rushed".
This is something I can identify myself with.
To provide some background: I submitted a handful of commits to Core during the last year, and I was invited to a Google docs document (i.e. the letter) around 20 hours before it was published here on Reddit. While I'm not strictly associated with any group or company, the closest thing to an association would probably be "independent core contributor of Omni Core [Mastercoin]".

What are you talking about? Any P2SH transaction must provide the preimage, the actual script, and satisfy that script. On top, if it uses SegWit, then it must also execute the witness program.
Currently people use SegWit programs wrapped into P2SH, mostly P2WPKH wrapped, the SegWit equivalent to P2PKH. For valid transactions:
1. a preimage to the hash must be provided
2. the preimage is a script that must be satisfied
3. that script is a witness porgram that must be satisfied
To satisfy the witness program of P2WPKH, one must provide a signature and pubkey, very similar to regular P2PKH.

Think about putting a $100 note into an envelope and sending it to a relative, and then think about putting 10,000x $0.01 coins into a packet. Your relative is also going to send the money to someone else. What do you think your relative would prefer and why?
Transaction fees are proportional to transaction size, and transactions with many inputs (or outputs) are larger than transactions with just a few inputs (or outputs).

I tested this on Ubuntu, and it works, more or less.
Out of 10 keys that I generated, 2 were recoverable from the dump, whereby 1 of them was the most recent one, and the other recovered key was the very first key generated.
This was done within a few seconds, while listening to music via YouTube.
The core dump of the Chrome process has a size of around 375 MB, and the extracted strings have a total size of about 35 MB, with around 2.1 million lines.
Filtering of the results may be useful:
    cat strings.txt | grep -o -w '5[123456789abcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ]\{50,50\}' | uniq
This translates to "get all words, starting with 5, followed by 50 base58 characters".
bitaddress.org can then be used to get details about the key candidates (via "Wallet Details").
I'd use the original machine *only* to generate the core dump, but it would be better to do the analysis on a different machine.

I might be completely wrong, but based on what I've read, it seems up to the garabage collector to free memory, which is allowed to free unused resources after they are unused, e.g. the object mykey you referred to in the example, but still, there is no guarantee. Let's go one step further, and think about this:
    char* pc = new CharObject();
    // ...
    pc = NULL;
Was the memory freed here? No, this leaks, because it just updated the pointer, but didn't actually delete the object.
The JS part I was referring to was mostly based on the comments here:


Keep in mind: at the beginning the key is just some blob of bits, but later converted into a human readable format, namely the "wallet import format" ("5...").
@_date: 2016-10-09 18:10:29
Yup, that's my point. It [checks]( any transaction associated with the address, and not only outgoing ones, and there is no check, whether a transaction was sent via `1DhDy...`.

Actually back then there was an on-chain tipping service for Reddit. And only because it's currently done off-chain, doesn't mean it couldn't be done via LN, which is preferred.


This isn't really related to the price, but more to transaction fee levels. But even with free block space, there are certain common constraints like a minimum fee of 1 satoshi per transaction size byte.

It really seems to come down to an communication issue. I'm fine with almost any arbitrary rule a provider requires, as long as it's communicated properly.
In an ideal scenario, I'd wish:
- to know these rules right from the start
- in this case this means: stating clearly which services are not allowed on CB
- this may even be part of the sign-up process, e.g. in form of a checkbox such as "I hereby declare my business is not xyz.."
And for a good customer experience, I'd wish that:
- my support messages are not ignored
- I receive an answer within a reasonable amount of time
- there is a bit of insight, especially in a case like this, which helps me to understand why this or that happens
- edit: bonus points for a personal experience
It seems like a waste of time for all involved parties, starting from OP, Reddit users and even the Coinbase CEO needed to get involved, even though this isn't this first time something like this happened. Managing expectations and clear communication is key in my opinion..
@_date: 2015-10-29 11:52:05
I kinda share the sentiment of The means of payment is only aspect to consider, and it hasn't been shown that using bitcoin really makes it easier and safer for criminals. I'm not sure if this holds true, and I'm also not familiar with specifics, but I'd be surprised, if there are not other, potentially more suitable alternatives to bitcoin.
There are other aspects, which potentially can reveal a criminal, such as the communication with the target, the kidnapping itself, the context, etc.
This may be a weak argument, but when reversing the assumptions, then you're basically saying:

If blocks fill up, the need for RBF becomes probably more clear. If there is frequent competition about block space, then it becomes harder to estimate a proper fee in advance, and the risk for a transaction to get stuck gets higher. RBF then helps bump fees and prioritize transactions.

It looks like the example page can be defaced by:
- creating and seeding a new webpage
- sending a transaction to `1DhDyqB4xgDWjZzfbYGeutqdqBhSF7tGt4` with one `OP_RETURN &lt;hash&gt;` script, where hash is the info hash (?) of the seeded torrent
The latest found hash is used to locate the actual website, but there is no check, where it comes from. :)

This is really not a topic I'm familiar with (unfortunally), but for example in Germany there seems to be no tax on the gains of a rising Bitcoin price, if the coins were held for more than a year. Furthermore while there seem to be taxes for the creation of coins (i.e. mining) of 25 % IIRC, this could be negligable, if the coins are old.
Consider, what if OP was paid in BTC? The "1 year holding rule" only appears to apply on the gains in price, but this leaves the question open, where the coins were originially coming from, and a payment for a job (as example) would probably heavily be taxed.
Please correct me, if I'm wrong though. :)

@_date: 2015-10-09 12:52:49
There are at least two "attacks" going on:
**1. Transaction spam**
Someone creates a lot of junk transactions, to overload the network and mempools. These transactions may look like regular transactions and they are paying fees (roughly 0.00001 BTC/kB), potentially delaying legit transactions. This is somewhat costly for the attacker and mitigations to make it harder for the attacker are on the way (see [here]( or [here](
Unfortunally the extra memory needed for these transactions appears to be an issue for some nodes. From an user's perspective it can likely be bypassed by paying higher fees than the attacker.
**2. Transaction malleability**
To some degree miners and nodes can manipulate transactions they mine or see, without changing their validity. This is possible, because a signature only covers a transaction without signatures (otherwise it would cover itself, which isn't possible), and the signature itself can be represented in two forms. The attacker transforms signatures of bypassing transactions from one form into the other. As result, due to the change of the transaction, the hash of the transaction has changed, too. The hash of the transaction is used as quasi-identifier, namely the "txid", which can create the impression, depending on how a wallet or transaction explorer handles it, some transactions have disappeared, or were double spends. In the end it does no harm, because the "meaning" of the mutated transactions is the same (i.e. same inputs were spent, same destinations received the coins), but it creates a challenge for those who process transactions, like payment processors or [exchanges]( which may have trouble tracking the mutated transactions and relating them to the ones that made it into a block.
A goal for some time is to avoid forms of malleability by restricting the potential forms of transactions, most notably here is [BIP 62]( The ongoing mutations are not yet addressed on a larger scale of the network, which makes it very easy for the attacker. This is not because the "devs" are lazy, but rather because it's still an ongoing process.
However: a few days ago a [patch was merged]( into Bitcoin Core to accept only one signature form, and to reject the other. This is not a consensus rule, but a policy, to make it harder for the attacker. At the same time a counter-measure [has been started]( to actively mutate transactions from the "wrong form" to the "accepted form" (some [more information]( to reduce the success rate of the attacker even further.
It is likely that there is going to be new releases of Bitcoin Core [rather soon]( to address these issues.
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:40:57
I'd love to know what the bottle neck is.
But if I'm not mistaken, then it's the transaction processing and indexing, so a SPV node may not be a game changer.

Write down your seed, if you haven't already. This is the most important step, and the following are basically optional:

After creating the redeemScript, the order of public keys is static, whether that's: keys[0], keys[1], keys[2] ... or keys[2], keys[1], keys[0].
This doesn't enforce that some user must sign before another (e.g. client signs, then server, or server, then client, re: your example). Edit just to clarify: the signature order should equal the public key order, but this just implies sigs[0] is inserted before sigs[1].

Well, the payloads have a CNTRPRTY prefix, but it's obfuscated. Deobfuscation is really simple though (using [7a39..f0]( as example):
    import binascii
    import Crypto.Cipher.ARC4
    # txid of first input is used for the deobfuscation:
    first_vin_txid = binascii.unhexlify('d9a34b9db67ee0ac496b7e2b5a1d7a2fb44b84c00760dda54c2ab6a76e1b4ec1')
    # the actual payload:
    op_return_data = binascii.unhexlify('124de6133f81f1121b181df754c0662915e764b5521ed918e30841fd')
    decoded = Crypto.Cipher.ARC4.new(first_vin_txid).decrypt(op_return_data)
    print(binascii.hexlify(decoded))
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:16:38
Interesting point.
It was possible to send coins to public keys, which are actually none (e.g. wrong prefix, invalid length), and while there were some checks [added]( to filter out non-canonical public keys, there is no check, whether a seemingly valid public key (or it's hash) is fully valid.
So in short: yes, it's possible to burn coins by sending them to something that looks valid, but doesn't represent a valid ECDSA coordinate (thus there can't be a valid private key to redeem the coins).

Private trackers are usually extremely fast for new files, but old files may indeed not be seeded very well. This is understandable, given that there is more demand for new files (thus more gain in terms of upload credit or whatsoever). Some trackers have request functions, whereby filling requests is rewarded with extra credits.
Pay4seed, and in this context "pay extra for old files", seems somewhat similar.
The issue I currently see is the following though:
There seems to be quite a bit of money being made with private trackers. Upload credits are usually sold by the trackers. I'm not too familiar with it, but to my knowledge upload credit is usually not transferable, which is actually a shame in my opinion.
If they were, it probably wouldn't be too far fetched to build a upload credit/BTC exchange.
However, if upload credits were tradable, then it's probably also not too far fetched that this would have an impact on the earnings due to the selling of upload credits by the trackers, so I assume trackers are not incentivized to move in this direction.
I believe the role of trackers is very important, at least at the beginning (even though: a pure P2P plattform without middle man, so to speak, should definitely be the end goal).

In that go I'm also providing referral link to CB. I never really cared about this though, but I checked in a few minutes ago.

1. Network participants have a list of unspent outputs, which needs to be accessed very fast, to know, whether a spent is valid or not.
2. Full nodes usually store each and every historical transaction, even if it was already processed.
3. In theory, and this is on the way, participants could "forget" about those outputs that were already spent, basically keeping only the list of unspent outputs, and optionally the recent, or all historical transactions.
4. In the early days, data was encoded as Bitcoin address, which can never be spent, because no one has the private key for it. This is toxic and bloats the "list of unspent outputs" for eternity.
5. State of art is that data is encoded in multisig outputs, where the sender holds one private key to redeem that output, and the other ones embedd the data. This is not toxic, because once this output is spent, it vanished from the list of unspent outputs, and may also eventually be forgotten as well.
6. OP_RETURN outputs can *immediately* be forgotten, which removes the step of spending an output. In my opinion a great improvement for everyone.

Interesting. Do you have any data to share regarding confirmation times of &gt;40 byte OP_RETURN transactions?

You are probably referring to segwit2x. There is a wipeout protection to enforce a chain split, when the hard fork part happens. However, this is still more than three months ahead, and not related to the 1st August. Furthermore, if not enough transactions are available to create a &gt;1 MB block, the block creation stops, until enough transactions are collected.

Well, they actually believe LN and SW are evil, as well as Blockstream.
Here is a collection of some beliefs:
- SW coins are different
- SW coins can be stolen due to the "anyonecanspend vulnerability"
- SW as soft fork is overly complex
- SW is a trojan horse by the current devs to stay in power
- SW adds 150% increase at a 400% cost
- SW is patented by Blockstream
- Blockstream wants to turn Bitcoin into CorperateCoin, which is ruled by AXA
- Blockstream wants to turn Bitcoin into a settlement layer, to sell 2nd layer products
- LN leads to centralized hubs run by Blockstream
- LN steals on-chain fees from the miners
- LN coins are not bitcoins
- LN doesn't work due to the lack of proper routing

- don't run arbitrary binaries from unknown sources, or you run into the risk of losing coins

I'm aware, and I think it's quite aweful to ship the software with those defaults, given the context, but appearingly this was not the cause of the delay.


Maybe, but as far as I understand the block creation stops until the &gt;1 MB block is mined, so in the worst case, the creation of the wipeout protection block is delayed.

I assume you were imaging to create a transaction with the full amount, which is funded by several sub transactions, which are funded by the crowdfund participants. Unfortunally this woulnd't work, because the main transaction can't be created without referrencing the outpoints of it's inputs. These inputs however are not immutable, and they change basically with each donation. As result, there is no known static reference which could be used to create the main transaction in advance. This is at least my understanding of this context.. :)

However, when signing in any order, the signatures are added "at the right place". If A signs after B, then A's signature *would* be added before B's signature. This section is mutable, and the signature insertion isn't strictly ordered, but new signatures may be added before or after other ones.

The primary argument is that full node users need to store asset transactions, and some say they are "no legit bitcoin transactions". Others argue all transactions are equal, and it shouldn't matter, whether it's a payment for a video game, a new shiny car or the creation of an asset, as long as all transactions are equally paying for network resources.
In this particular case introduced a patch to refine the mempool policy to prevent a [sigops exhaustion attack]( though his code accidently also blocked some bare-multisig scripts. This was not a desired effect. Coincidentally a very tiny number of asset transactions use bare-multisig for data encoding, maybe 1-2 %, while the majority use OP_RETURN scripts, which restarted the discussion about the legitimacy of asset transactions. As workaround to get around Luke's patch, users started to bloat transactions, which was also not a good result. Both proposed fixes ensure bare-multisig scripts are no longer blocked while maintaining a protection against the sigops attack, in one form or another.

Some time ago I took a stab at getting a better understanding of chain usage based on applications. It doesn't really tackle micro transactions, and it's potentially outdated, but maybe it helps nevertheless:
- 
For the categorization I used the following patch (note: this is an earlier version, I can't find it right now, but you may go throuhg my branches on GH):
- 
As for the general approach, you may consider the following questions (just some brainstorming):
- what is the size of an average Bitcoin transaction, how has it changed over time?
- what are the average transaction fees, how has it changed over time?
- how do transaction fees and transaction size play together?
- is there a relation between transaction values and transaction fees?
- what is the role of default network policies, e.g. default fees "dictated" by Bitcoin Core?
- which impact does the block size and global transaction volume have on micro transactions?
- what's the role of miners and pools in all this? what policies do the larger pools use?
In the past transaction fees were primarily affected by default policies (you may check out fee related updates of Bitcoin Core, and look for significant changes of average fees), but this (potentially) shifted after fees started to float, and were choosen based on historical confirmation times.

Primarily this is an issue for [payment channels and other applications]( that rely on "refund transactions".
Consider Alice and Bob create a multisig destination, whereby Alice doesn't necessarily trust Bob. As mitigation Bob signs a transaction refunding Alice, which spends outputs of the funding transaction (which isn't broadcasted yet). Alice now has the chance to pull out, by broadcasting the refund transaction, in case anything goes south.
The issue however is that, if the funding transaction is mutated (and the mutated version confirms), then the refund transaction becomes invalid, because it refers to other outpoints than actually confirmed (i.e. outpoints with another "txid").

Note that Omni and Counterparty, amongst some others, use a different encoding scheme than OP_RETURN mostly for transactions with larger payloads, such as asset creations.

Then I looked at ways to maximize BTC profit, instead of BTC/USD trading and I got involved in Bitcoin stocks. It was awesome, the [the first half of this year]( (BTCT combined market cap) was super bullish.
Sadly, this time has ended. BTCT and BitFunder closed, there were scams and the current stock market situation isn't all that great at all.

With more and more ASIC devices it will be less and less profitable for GPU/FPGA miners and I'd really love to see, if you would give those a opportunity to reuse their hardware.
I've read the statement "they'll do it for the price of electricity". Please don't get that wrong. I'm sure there are many out there, who mine for the sake of Bitcoin, but paying those, who aren't profitable at BTC mining anymore due to increased network hashrate, only the cost of electricity, is what I would call exploitation. But I'm sure, that's not your intention at all, just saying. :)
So basically you want to buy computing power. After reading through the comments, doing it in a way Bitcoins are mined seems very complicated, nevertheless I'm pretty sure people would love to contribute and it also sounds like buying computing power in the outer world is very expensive. There are many with mining hardware and it's great to see people like you contribute to Bitcoin. I give you much credit for that, because you didn't come here and said "hey guise, you do some work for me and ill buy pay u usd" or something. :) I see a huge market here, but the question is how to turn that idea in something applicable.
I'm not familiar with the implementation of the Monte Carlo algorithm, so I can't help with the former question, but my advice: create a thread on the [bitcointalk.org forum]( You'll need 5 posts and 4 hours online time. Maybe you could even post this in the newbie section. I'm sure many read on reddit, but it seems more target-orientated.
A smaller step could be to start to not start with a distributed network, but with explicit offers or requests for calculations, i.e. something like "I'll pay x BTC for 72 h MC simulations".
I hope you work something out and I'd love to see more of this in the future! :)

Even after reading [this]( clever paper about un-bluring, I don't see any solution to crack the original at all. It's nothing more than bruteforcing the private key; the additional step of mapping the blur algorithm is probably slower than public key generation itself, but that doesn't even matter as brute forcing alone is too complex. So I ask: **what kind of magick was used to decipher the key?**

I really like the idea! Here is a further suggestion: you said after 60-days coins will be send back, if they are not accepted. How about being more dynamic? Like including something like "outgoing transactions/pending", where you can redo the send order at anytime, if it's not claimed before?
It would be also great to actually see who of my friends has BTC TX in use. Worst case use scenario is something like: "hey, let's send some coins to a friend. ... oh, seems he doesn't respond ... 60 days later..".

I think you already know this, but because it's so important: if you use paper wallets and spend some coins from them, know about change addresses. - If you only spend a percentage of your paper wallet, the rest will be transfered to a defined change address and if you dont define one, it's considered as fee.

Wow, it's a bit shocking to realize how right you are. I never gambled, but I do some Bitcoin trading. In the current state I almost declare it as playmoney. Not in the sense "I have soo much money, it doesn't matter, if I lose it all", but from a psychological view. It wouldn't be that bad to loose 0.5 BTC, but give 50 EUR away? No way!
I almost never use paper money, but online banking, EC and credit cards. Strangely, in those cases, I don't have this "gambling feeling", so maybe it's just a matter of time, to connect "Bitcoin" psychological to "money"?

You can trade ASICMINER-PT shares for direct shares once a month or for a fee.
TAT.ASICMINER shares are splitted ASICMINER-PT shares and you can't change them to ASICMINER-PT oder direct shares.
ASICMINER-PT has no fees. But keep in mind! They are without fees, because burnside manages btct.co, otherwise it would be nearly impossible.
TAT.ASICMINER is traded a bit cheaper and takes 5 % of the dividende.
I'm invested in both and both admins seem to be very nice people. Friedcat (the "owner" of ASICMINER) is cool with them. I use TAT, when I have BTC left, which isn't enough for full PT shares.

Well, this is only half of the story. On a long term base you are definitly right. The more shit they do, people start to wake up, realize the true beauty of Bitcoin and the evil face of it's competitor.
But let's look at the short-mid term implications. On a short term cutting off money supply to Gox restricts new buyers. But more important: if it's about crimes, terrorism or anything else related, ... Bitcoin already has that "BTC? Isn't that the internet money to buy drugs?" image. That will affect those, who aren't true believers, but think it's hip. And maybe investors. If it's risky to do BTC business, there will be less. Worst case mid term: this is only the beginning of a targeted attack against Bitcoin, which I do not rule out, but is very speculative at the current point.
Best case, of course, would be, if we get a reasonable explanation of what happend soon. If that doesn't shake the short-mid term fundament, prices will jump back and even higher.
Edit: to be clear: I value BTC very high on a long term. But this *is* bad. Still: most traders have that "it's a chance to buy even more" mindset.

I was only able to grap the user's IP and stuff, but I was not able to do nasty stuff on the victim server.

Starting with a (almost) zero percent fee is what all those Chinese exchanges do or did with awesome results. It's a bit like an "egg and chicken" problem. There are no traders, because there is no volume, but there is no volume, because there are no traders. Even if your service is great, which I can't really know without testing, I need a very convincing reason to abandon the "working system" (i.e. trading where volume is) and bite in the bitter apple of lower volume. Another smallish thing about the landing page: my first impression was: "oh gawd, not another Bootstrap hobby exchange with *stock photos*".

135 parcels were flown from Shanghai to Hong Kong on 2013-06-25 and received by UNI GLORY INTL LOGISTICS. There are two weeks missing, either for further transportation or redistribution.
Pictures were shot between 2013-07-09 18:09:55 - 19:09:25 with a Samsung GT-I9008 and Canon EOS 350D, and modified with ACD Systems Digital Imaging from 2013-07-09 22:07:04 - 22:58:16. I'm sure those pictures were taken during unpacking and those chips aren't deployed yet.
He received most likely less than 374.400 chips in the last days or possibly hours. The bigger boxes are clearely tagged with "n/24" and thus 24 * 6 * 260 * 10 = 374.400 chips max, but on the upper left box is a label with "QTY: 7.834" which is far less than 15.600 per box. One box below: "QTY: 7.815". My best guess: somewhere around but higher than 187.200 chips or 47.923,2 TH/s with stock clocking of 256 MH/s per chip.
The blacked part number is "P/N CME3256", which is confirmed by the very visible barcode.

Interessting idea. Could you briefly explain to me, what a hardware wallet would actualy do or how it would be used? Is it simply a password safe to another wallet or is it the wallet without password, which could be accessed, if you plug it into your PC? Or something like "I command my hardware wallet to send a transaction to XX" and that's the only gateway to the outside?

OP, I agree and I disagree. Those Coinbase posts on the frontpage usually indeed get their attention and therefore the problem is usually solved. This also makes sure that a lot of people see that something went wrong with CB - which is of course not in CB's favor. This hopefully will result in an even better customer support.

It's a gateway between regular currency and Bitcoin.

I don't understand one thing and maybe someone can make this clear to me.
They say, the banks don't want contact to Bitcoin, because it may be unclear how BTC is treated legaly and this could affect AML processes.
But: TransferWise acts as connection between banks and not between Bitcoin buyers and sellers or anything near to that. What I mean: the one who sends money through TW is attached to some bank account, so he is "well known" and also, the money recipient on the other side, is attached to a "well known" bank account.

Ah, [that]( picture. If you didn't already, you may also take a look at the written [documentation]( of the tipbot. I'm not sure, how advanced your knowledge in Bitcoin already is, but I assume you understand the concept of a Bitcoin wallet. Under the hood the tipbot creates a new wallet for each user, if one receives the first tip or if one initiates this manually. The bot recognizes tip commands in comments and initiates a tip by asking the user via PM, if he likes to accept the tip. The bot returns the coins back to the tipper, if the user declines or after a timespan of 30 days of no reaction. After accepting a tip, the bot transfers coins from the tipper's wallet to the one who was tipped and responds with a [comment]( as confirmation. User can furthermore send cois directly to the address of the underlying Bitcoin wallet, if they like to fund it for example. Commands to withdrawal or send coins to other Bitcoin wallets exist. And there are also some funny keywords like "flip", "beer", "tea" (...) that can be used to tip. Hope the explaination helps, please enjoy! +roll verify :)

I feel with you. Bitstamp went down earlier with a price difference of ~6 $ to Gox. Anyway, price went down really fast and I sold at 105. It really feels bad, but as we hit 103 a few minutes ago, it's already profitable, dispite the fact, that I could have gained more, if sold earlier. Nevertheless.. I hate the feeling. I still feel hurt and abused somehow. :D So don't feel bad, bro. This happens. Take a deep breath and take some time to calm down. It doesn't matter, if we pause and stay some hours off the field. Relative value change is everything that is important and not the actual price.
For my part: buying back in at 100-105 looks so delicious. And looking at those bumps.. 103 to 109, it really is important to buy back in at the right moment, but I have to fight against that instinct. Without more information of the Dwolla case, this could have some pretty significant implications.

To the author:
I honor your research, but you got one important fact wrong. Those 135 parcels were the whole stack of the transportation company and combined under one MAWD ("Master Air Way Bill" - 871-50508076). This is done regulary and the picture of the parcels shows clearly another line labled with HAWD The "House Air Way Bill" (JHG13060373) is the internal identifier for each receiver. Each parcel has "PCS 24" printed on the shipping label and is tagged with "n/24".
I also think he received less than 374400 chips. On the upper left box is a label with "QTY: 7834" which is far less than 15600 per box. One box below: "QTY: 7815". Couldn't read the other labels due to the picture quality, but my best guess: somewhere around but higher than 187200 chips and guaranteed less than 358850 chips. Equals 52.7904 TH/s - 101.1957 TH/s with stock clocking.

The normal pass through shares have zero fees also and if you like, you can change them for direct shares at any time. It's done that way, to reduce time which would be involved in manageing the shares. Maybe you want to start [here]( or real through the main ASICMINER thread from friedcat.

I was thinking about buyuing an hardware authenticator like [Yubikey]( It's a small USB device which acts as "password safe and generator" by emulating a keyboard and entering a password after you press a button on it. It can either be configured to store a static password or generate a one time password each time you use it. The last feature has to be supported by the application or website you use it for, but [KeePass]( does so, which I found quite useful anyway. It has storage for two profiles, so you could easily save two static passwords, one static and one dynamic etc.
Then I'd set up a clean system and fully crypt it with TrueCrypt and configure a long static password which I'd release through that Yubikey during boot process and unlock KeePass with later on, where I'd store crazy long passwords for any website and application I'd like.

Someone is probably playing. Bitcoin has a large amount of codes which can be used to build transactions: 
A conventional transaction output looks like this: "the one who is able to create a valid signature for address x is allowed to spend this amount", whereby x the address of the receiver is.
In this case two things happend: in the [first transaction]( an output was created which "was spendable without any requirement" (= anyone can spend the coins). The [second transaction]( redeemed this output and was created with an output "that never can be redeemed". :)

Great idea! This plan could be optimized further imho. A raid on the same day seems to be a bit too soon, so some lead time of one or two days would be nice. I also suggest to define one or more targets. Tipping reddit-wide without swarm organization won't be as efficient as raiding a specific subreddit for example. The target discussion should be done in a way such that the target most likely has no prior knowledge to the raid and users won't try to exploit the raid, i.e. by trying to farm tips. The audience will most likely not know much about the topic Bitcoin and bitcointip, so there should be a landing page or paper ready which could be published after the raid. Maybe a following Q&amp;A and discussion could be done. And of course: [promotion pictures](

pizza.be, it's a company of takeaway.com, like lieferservice.de.

I'm confused. I thought this was the seized coins wallet? [1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX](

I think this was BTC-E. They allowed code execution via /news/xx?page=&lt;script.. Something like that should not happen.
@_date: 2013-06-17 23:26:49
There is Tor. :)

In what context does this happen? Who are you, so to say? Best wishes!
@_date: 2013-05-07 19:32:04
Can someone please explain what this is about? Is it about regulating exchange markets? Like" if you open an exchange, you must cover all value, that's on the market" or something like "you as individual in the US are allowed to only hold max 100 BTC" for example?
**Edit:**  is helpful. It's about regulating possible derivate markets in the US.

I think what he tried to say was CPU mining was last year. People now use ASICs and even with a super duper huge botnet it isn't that profitable anymore.

Haha.. here is a funny fact: I asked them about their opinion about Bitcoin exactly two days ago. Their answer was something like "we are looking at it, but don't have a business plan yet". I'll edit/repost the translated mail, when I get home in a few hours.
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:13:47
I'm wondering.. are those attached to the markets directly or something like that? So when you exchange money, how is the price determined? .edit: or do they just sell the technology?
@_date: 2013-06-22 14:51:47
Don't worry. While it's a bit annoying, this isn't something new and happens sometimes. They suffer much DoS. :/

Sorry, I hijack this thread for a noobish question. It sounds like there are some servers which store the private keys and act as gateway and the seed/brainphrase is the key to your electrum account to which those private keys are linked. Is that correct? If so, what is the reason to consider this trustworthy?
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:54:22
You can transfer coins via the bot, but I'm unsure how you would use it to manage bids? :)
@_date: 2013-04-22 02:10:42
bitcoincharts.com was down and came back a few times.

I suggest to verify the mail via a support ticket. This is completely seperated from any mail contact. Furthermore check out, if you actually are on the real bitstamp.net website. Enter the URL manually and check the SSL certificate.
@_date: 2013-06-11 19:48:54
May I ask why? As far as I know both provide the same service, one time passwords generated by a piece of hardware/the authentificator app.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:33:34
I hope they don't. There are many oppertunities to invest into Bitcoin, but there are only a few Bitcoin related products at the moment where mining and mining hardware is number  I'd like to see the money stay in the Bitcoin eco system.
@_date: 2013-10-18 22:54:31
Well, let's just hope you don't forget to care about your customers. :P Thanks for teh gold! :)

There are several threads on bitcointalk.org where BTCGuild's admin talks about his role in great detail. Believe me, if you give his words any credit,  he is not satisfied with the current state and will take any step to prevent 51 %. I.e. "at xx % hashing power, fee will incresed by y" etc. :)
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:14:02
Good point. I didn't look at it this way. :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:41:20
Sorry that I have to ask.. but what does this seller allegedly offer? I know SR, but I can't imagine his service. Or to be more precise: I think he offers exchange.. but I thought all the time SR is a site where you *pay* with BTC and not other currencies..

You also could access the API:

Buy [ASICMINER shares]( There is still no official announcement of next gen hardware and thus the price is low. But: the huge potential is there.

The usage of the ' during login, signup and password reset redirect to:






Buy and sell orders with a negative amount of BTC are accepted, were shown correctly while open, but when filled, you receive a quantity of 0.00000000 / 2.00000000 BTC (or any negative number you enter), which still cost money + fees.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:03:01
Basically you say he got busted because some users used frauded money through his service or the authorities think so. It would be so great to hear something "official", i.e. naming the alleged charges, to get more solid knowledge about the law situation around BTCs.
@_date: 2013-10-15 19:51:16
Are you referring to something like "there needs to be a 'centralized' point which lists all genesis tx and color mappings"?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:36:49
Speaking of specifications and such.. I was looking for it for some time now, mind to forward me to Bitcoin's spec?

Wow.. I'm mad. And +1 for John Stossel, he seems to be a very nice and bright guy.

Bitstamp has an option to fund via Ripple, but I couldn't find any information or exchange rate.

The sceenshot I posted shows that many small orders were made at that moment. You can use [bitcoinity.org/markets]( or [bitcoin.clarkmoody.com]( to see which orders are made at Mt.Gox. On the first one in the upper right is a label named "WTF?". Press this to see explanations to every element. The numbers show buy/sell orders, the line is the current price for 1 BTCs and the bars show the current volume. The volume visualizes how many BTC are traded at a given time period.
During the last days users discovered many many small orders followed by some significant action on the market and on Mt.Gox. Take a look at [Proof of price manipulation in bitcoin trading]( and [This is a fucking disgrace.]( for further information.
**TL;TR:** Bad guys use bots to flood Mt.Gox, either to **induce price manipulation** or **crash the servers**.

I didn't know of Clipperz, but after reading the story, I will take a closer look. Thanks for sharing.

So much awesomenes! "Why should someone use Bitcoin?" - redirect them to this thread. :D Gratulations Jorge, super nice picture, Obitus. :)

It's an beta playgroud for evaluation, not a real exchange *yet*. But it's coming. And it seems it's going to be big.

Line charts show median price, unless you use 1 tick data. Candlesticks are a good way to display relevant information.
OP: this looks absolute fantastic! While I really honor your work and think you should indeed sell it, instead of giving it away for free, I still want to suggest to publish a free trial version. One good way to deliver a free trial without influceing the sales of the real thing could be to only include historical 1 day data without shorter timeframes, real time data and trading interface.

And yet it's another website that uses highcharts. Seriously guys, highcharts and bootstrap, it's everywhere. :S
