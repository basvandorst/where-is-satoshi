You have it all wrong.  
Chargebacks only cost the Merchant money. In some cases nearly double the original sale.  
  
Example:  
Sam creates a $2,553.27 order for a $2,500 laptop from buyalaptop.com with a MonsterCharge card.  
  
Sam starts the checkout process and enters the typical credit card details.  
  
The buyalaptop.com web server contacts it's Merchant creditcard gateway WebMerchant and sends the transaction details.  
WebMerchant relays the transaction to the MonsterCharge card network.  
  
MonsterCharge contacts the cardholder's bank MegaBank to authorize and capture funds.  
  
MegaBank replies and says, "yes this account has funds to cover this transaction, and the postal code and cvv match".  
  
(Note: The only data that gets verified in a cc trans is card num, exp, cvv, postal code , numeric segment of the billing address)  
  
WebMerchant releays the response back to the buyalaptop.com web server.  
  
The buyalaptop.com web server marks the order as paid.  
  
A buyalaptop.com worker picks packs and ships the laptop via PackageExpress, shipping was $53.27 for overnight.  
  
Later that evening a WebMerchant server closes the buyalaptop.com daily processing batch and submits it.  
  
The next day buyalaptop.com's bank 1stCyber deposits the $2,553.27 in buyalaptop.com's account it received from WebMerchant .  
  
PackageExpress delivers the package to Sam, his sister signs for it.  
  
A week passes.
WebMerchant withdraws $76.59 from buyalaptop.com's 1stCyber account for the Bankcard Fee, Bankcard Interchange Fee, and Bancard Discount Fee.
Sam then the a week later calls up MegaBank and says this $2,553.27 charge on his account is fraud.  
  
MegaBank initiates a chargeback with MonsterCard.  
  
WebMerchant withdraws $2,553.27 from buyalaptop.com's account for the chargeback and sends them a letter in the mail about the chargeback giving them 30 days to file a rebuttal to the chargeback.  
  
buyalaptop.com files the rebuttal showing that the package was sent and signed for.  
  
MonsterCharge decides that because the cardholder didn't sign for the package the chargeback is valid.  
  
WebMerchant withdraws $35.00 from buyalaptop.com's account as a Chargeback fee.
  
buyalaptop.com is out not just $2,553.27 but $4,964.86 in total, here is how  
  
$2,300.00  Laptop Wholesale Cost  
$0,053.27  Shipping  
$0,076.59  Card Fees  
$2,553.27  Chargeback  
$0,035.00  Chargeback Fee
  
$4,964.86 Total Loss    
So you see the only people that made money were WebMerchant and MonsterCharge and the big loser was buyalaptop.com. this is just one reason a chargeback can stick. Both WebMerchant and MonsterCharge have no motivation to fix creditcard fraud because they make money either way and don't care if the merchant suffers.

813594 you don't get it.  
  
Yes they initially were paid $2,553.27, perhaps they used that money to buy more inventory.
  
Then the Merchant Provider took it back ($2,553.27) to cover the chargeback.
  
That is a loss.
Returned funds ($2,553.27) 
They still have to pay the laptop manufacturer ($2,300.00)
Still have to pay the shipping ($53.27)
Still have to pay the card fees ($76.59)
And for the privilege of a chargeback a ($35.00) fee 
The thief Sam, got both the laptop and his money back.

Incorrect.  
The $2,553.27 was taken back out of the merchants account the moment the chargeback was filed.
