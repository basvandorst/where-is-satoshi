Actually this is the same in America and europe. The whole "using clients money to get bailed out." It's called a BAIL-IN. It's in the dodd-frank bill. This from cyprus.
*"The latest news from Cyprus reported in a Wall Street Journal article 5 late last year is that the existing shareholders were almost completely wiped out and 21,000 bank clients who had deposits of more than 100,000 euros saw 47.5% of their unsecured savings converted to equity making them 81.4% owners of an insolvent bank."*

The pattern it a fractal. Just as there are micro bubbles that pop all the time. And periodical medium bubbles that pop - like the one right now. Just like those,  there is a big bubble that hasn't popped yet and will in the future and it will dwarf all of these and ones in the past - relative to how much money is actually lost.

Debt. The government. The fed. The world economy. The military. Oil! (The system has adopted the usd to be used... so therefore it's safe as long as the system is in place)
I get the argument tho. But bitcoin is backed by even less. Bitcoin doesn't have that "system". If it crashes then IT crashes. With minimal effects on anything outside the crypto market.

I thought the banks are the shadowy wall street investors, in the dudes comment above. 
I simply thought what he meant was that much more experienced and professional traders are gonna enter the market  (banks). And they know more then the average crypto investor (see: me) and basically wipe the floor with our FUD and FOMO.
But I'm sure it's more complicated than that.

@_date: 2017-11-27 18:35:15
Notice the fear you have with investing at close to 10k. Now consider that there are sssooooo many other people with the same fear. This *feels* like alot. So, when it does hit 10k, expect that people are gonna panic sell (expecting a crash) but there will not be enough people to buy (so it will crash). The price will drop. And will not rise until it *feels* like it's a good time to buy. Until confidence is restored. One thing bitcoin has going for it, is the large wallets that have been hodling for a long time.
Look at 1k and 5k. Same thing happened. 
But I could be wrong too.

This. This is why it will go down. Because more people are scared to buy in at this high of a price. But then it will go back up as confidence is restored.

@_date: 2017-10-15 15:59:13
I agree. But there was no "previous" bubble. The entire thing is one. Like the bubble hasn't burst yet.
I have a gut feeling it's gonna burst next year. Why? Because i invested this year and the universe does not look kindly upon me.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:08:00
Goddamnit greg!
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:04:23
But are those bubbles or corrections?? I assumed that when a bubble actually burst then the whole thing goes down. Like the dotcom bubble. And then slowly picks up. (A big giant correction).
"It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future" - wiki
I feel as though this is happening in crypto markets. So many coins in every sector of life.
Psychologically, it's getting kinda ridiculous. Like bitcoin  15k? As a laymen, it feels like it's  not sustainable. I know that doesn't count for much but perception of a market is pretty important as far as investing is concerned. I think most people (laymen) can't even understand why bitcoin is so much.
Bitcoin is bigger than so many companies already. My gut is saying that next year is make it or break it.
