Man, this is an interesting idea. Crowdfunded infrastructure. I guess it would be like paying taxes, except for the part where the money isn't used for said infrastructure.

This is true...But all around the internet the primary advice is to not mine with low hash rate equipment (relative to overall hash rate), irregardless of what the future price may be. 
I'm not hating on mining, despite all the people who say it's better to just buy Bitcoin, I did buy a few miners and I still run them. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:55:43
just means the hardware isn't powerful enough anymore. They will still run, but will mine less and less Bitcoin. Not because there is anything wrong or "used up" about the equipment, but because the overall network hash rate is so high. If the network hash rate were to go way down and the difficulty to adjust, the miners would be useful again. But so many people are buying ASIC miners with really high hash rates that it will unlikely go down.

I'm sorry but this sounds terribly ignorant. There's no way anybody but a die hard Bitcoin believer would take their wages in a currency that is so nascent. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:37:33
Because as the hash rate gets higher, it gets harder to mine. So to stay profitable, miners require higher and higher hash rates. People suspect that bfl used their miners while they were profitable and once they tapered off in coin production they shipped them out. When I first got my 10 G/hash miner it was mining about .01 btc per day on Slush's pool. Now it's down to .0003 or so.

An excellent point!
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:08:34
Hah, this is a great point that I hadn't even started thinking about. For example, which economy would it be indexed to? The US? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:14:10
I hope being a repost police makes you happy in life.

Right because some wanker on the internet is smarter/has a better grasp on the future than the people creating the future (Silicon Valley). Enjoy your time in the paper belt.

This seems like a legit idea, I'd be willing to contribute some Bitcoin towards development....have to see some deliverables though.
edit--correct autocorrect...FUUUU
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:56:15
I'd never heard the power grab angle, but it sounds interesting. I'll have to do some digging around for more info. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:03:44
This is similar to another idea posted this week about using Rockbox to convert old MP3 players to cold storage. Hopefully the OP sees this, because it seems like a good idea. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:10:46
Awesome, thanks!

I watched that video and felt like cheering. Sign me up, I'm ready to opt in.
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:01:46
I'm in the market for a mattress so definitely going to keep an eye on this development....

We're all becoming more disillusioned with our government, especially its handling of money. I think to the US government anyone who questions their authority and legitimacy is a terrorist. So in a way our very interest in Bitcoin makes us a terrorist. Not saying this is right, it pisses me off. But I can see the logic. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:29:59
Ah cool thanks, I did a search to see if this story was already posted but I guess I didn't get the right search terms. Definitely appreciate the link to the pdf. 
EDIT: Oops, I see on the main page this is a better discussion
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:53:38
Awesome, love this 
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:32:06
I love the "fuck you". I Don't understand everything about money,  economics etc to fully appreciate Bitcoin, but I get the fuck you part.

Convert old phone or mp3 player to cold storage using Rockbox...posted more info in another comment in this topic.

Great video, saw that a couple years ago but just re-watched. 
"If we can leave the creative energies of humankind uninhibited, there's no limit to what we can accomplish."

Well, I definitely see where you are coming from on those examples...However I have a couple different ideas. Primarily, we're assuming that the examples you cite arise out of a pure free market. Companies take advantage not only of the market, but also of regulation to become what they are. So perhaps there is more to why a company like Wal-Mart becomes what it is. 
Recently I was reading a book (The Color of Oil) that went over the history of oil and gas markets, and it was surprising to see how counter intuitively companies responded in order to take advantage of regulation. In programming there is a phenomenon called priority inversion, and I see government involvement in the market as something like that, it causes companies to act in a priority inverted way. By trying to control the market, one is saying that they are able to predict the outcome. I submit that that is false.

I would say in third world countries almost any currency is worthless...which is a big reason they are third world. Sort of a chicken and the egg type of thing. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 21:03:49
I'm so glad you posted this...didn't know it myself and what I was reading was blowing my mind. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:59:07
Sent you a tip as well, first time using the Reddit Bitcoin bot, so I wasn't sure if I did it right but looks like the transaction went through. I'm a big fan of stand up comedy so hopefully you can get others on board...maybe some Drew Carey stuff...haha.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:20:54
But would it mean giving money specifically? If the supply expands, then it just means there are more coins to mine, so I guess the miners would get them initially like they do now. But if the supply shrinks..yeah that I guess wouldn't work because coins would have to be extracted.

I don't know if hitting $900 for a spilt second ( I saw it happen on bitcoinity, pretty much been watching that site constantly this week) then going on to settle in the mid-range is a crash. I guess it depends on when you bought. I could sell right now and make money.
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:09:45
Here's the idea from last week, proposed by u/PSBlake... 






@_date: 2013-10-31 18:38:29
Ah, sorry about that...the irony went over my head. Guess I just wanted to say wanker on the internet, lol.
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:19:26
Definitely not going to disagree with you on that. I was just thinking along the lines that in a 3rd world country without structured commerce, pretty much any currency is going to be harder to use there. In Mogadishu is the dollar worth much to anybody besides the corrupt leaders? Honestly I don't know, just a train of thought. 
As another counterpoint to SPESSMEHREN  that ties in with what you say, maybe Bitcoin would actually benefit the 3rd world greatly. The US wouldn't be able to print money and ship it to corrupt leaders. Or maybe they could, but it wouldn't matter. 
Either way, this is all in the way of discussion I don't have any agenda here.  Other than I think it is short sighted to say Bitcoin won't work because of poor areas of the world. The freedom and prosperity that Bitcoin has the potential to unleash would undoubtedly help anyone anywhere in the world. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:07:05
Haha, how would you describe this state of mind? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:57:03
Monopoly is inevitable? Please explain. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:26:16
Because it is short sighted bullshit. If all progress were doomed to failure because it isn't useful in the third world, then the entire planet would be a third world. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:28:35
So, I've got no mentionable programming skills, but what would be needed to get the ball rolling? Maybe start an account on github? Some startup bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:46:05
Yeah that makes sense, basically the value of the currency functions as the index. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:51:53
Is the Fed segment in the full length Keep Up video? I'll probably just buy that if so. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:20:24
Came across this while doing some bitcoin research...the article itself is sparse on actual information. From my understanding, the more computing power being leveraged, the more difficult it becomes to mine coins. So these "Selfish Miners" wouldn't necessarily be doing themselves favors. Also, there is nothing preventing another group from pooling and competing. Overall I'd say the article is on the side of malarkey.

So far I've registered a domain, bought a phone case, a kindle case, and tickets to see Catching Fire.
