Bitcoiners often have this arrogant "enlightened" attitude (*a la* the rest of the contents here) and tout it as the be-all, end-all solution to all of life's problems, no matter how irrelevant.  Credit application rejected?  Should've used Bitcoin.  McDonalds stiffed you a quarter in change?  Bitcoin.  Gas station sold out of fuel because the supplier couldn't meet demand for the month?  You guessed it, Bitcoin is the magic bullet that would have done absolutely nothing in reality to solve the problem but was brought up anyway by one of its adherents.
Even if your comments specifically were relevant and helpful, people just get sick of the circlejerk.

I'm used to keeping all my shit on a second drive and keeping the first one dedicated to Windows and programs so I can wipe it without backing up... yeah, that wallet died.  It was a couple months until the price started skyrocketing before I remembered my BTC, tried to image the drive and recover them but it had been too long and too many writes.

At the rate BTC's exchange is climbing (hell, even if it slows to a tenth its current rate), it makes far more sense to cash out slowly, as needed, than to sell 'em all and invest in real estate, bonds, stocks, commodities, anything, because the potential return on the price of BTC down the road far outweighs the potential returns of other investments.

I would just like to point out that there are a number of video cards around their bulk 1.99 BTC price point, at today's exchange rate, that achieve better hashrates.  
Furthermore, assuming today's difficulty, $0.09/kWh, and the current exchange rate it'll take half a year to recoup the cost.  If the difficulty doubles so does the time.
This is assuming you get your hands on them at 1.99 BTC.  Since the minimum order is 300 units I suspect this is out of reach for most, forcing them to rely on a middleman, driving the price up and profit down.  IMHO, the only profit to be had with these is for the manufacturer and resellers.

Not having a complete understanding of how to grow, extract, process, design, and build from raw materials to finished product every item a person uses is a far cry from *Idiocracy.*  Seriously, do you not see the hypocrisy in your own statement?  Based on your logic, you should be living in a log cabin (maybe, if you were smart enough to build yourself an axe or saw) and living hand-to-mouth on whatever you can pull out of the ground or kill with a pointy stick.
The entire basis of society is that people living in groups are able to specialise in something and share it with everyone else.  Shit, it's been this way since the dawn of time... you didn't have every person in a village with a working knowledge of hunting, fishing, farming, cooking, sewing, brewing, woodcutting, tanning, and every other thing required for survival.  People might have had understanding of two or three, and relied on each other to help out for the survival and progress of the community as a whole.

If you were relying on someone else's money, that tells me you didn't have your own money.  Switching to BTC does not change this.


Plenty of credit cards have no yearly fees.  If you pay your balance every month there is no interest accrued.  Again, this tells me that you don't have your own money, and again, switching to BTC does not solve this problem.
@_date: 2013-09-21 15:24:21
It's still easier to use cash/debit/credit in most cases.  BTC might be easier to split up for oddball transactions between friends who trust each other and when time isn't a factor, but overall it's still more hassle and slower.
Case 1:  Count out your change ahead of time or buy a bus pass.  If you're fumbling around with your phone or paper wallet it's just as bad as fumbling with change.
Case 2:  Landlord won't accept a money transfer?  I can pull every cent in my chequing and savings accounts, as well as max out my line of credit, and send it via email to anyone in less than five minutes from any computer with Internet access.
Case 3:  Address history doesn't constitute proof of work income, and you'd be silly to use the same one to deposit your payments and pay your bills.  My work emails me my paystubs; if someone needs to see them it takes about ten seconds to attach one to a new email, three minutes to fax over the 'Net, or whatever time to print and deliver a physical copy.
Case 4/5:  Yeah, BTC is easier for these if you're genuinely concerned about penny-perfect cost splitting and want to settle up immediately.  In these situations my friends and I usually even it out next time we buy beer or go out for dinner or something.  
Bitcoin has a long way to go before it's universally more convenient than cash or plastic.

"Tremendous gains" isn't exclusive to in-hand fiat currency.  Buddy who bought or mined ten thousand bitcoins three years ago has made tremendous gains at this point, even if he hasn't exchanged a single one for cash.
And again, I'd like to emphasize that diversification right now, regardless of the size of gains, makes less sense than simply holding onto BTC.  You're holding on to your small amount of bitcoins, others may be holding on to their larger amounts, with the exception of those who have enough to cash out gradually and retire (which you could safely bet I'd do too).

The thing about brute force cracking is it doesn't make a bit of difference how fast your cracking hardware is when the target is only able to process them at a particular rate.  You think the bitcointip server is able to process ten billion guesses a second?  I'd wager it's a good deal slower than that when you throw in network latency (safe to assume that the would-be hacker doesn't have physical access).  When you throw in an incorrect password and the only response from the server is "Nope, try again," there simply is no more efficient method of cracking.  This isn't a game of warmer/colder that narrows down the possibilities.  And on top of all that, if there's any sort of account lockout after X failed attempts (which seems likely given that OP knows about the attempted attack), game over.

Hell, I'd say it's probably safe to assume they're doing just that right now, hence the reason for the delays... run some serious mining for a few weeks until the difficulty climbs (call it an extended stress test, haha) then ship 'em all out for cash after you've racked up a few thousand Bitcoins.

About an hour later I cracked my wallet to pay for something else, and discovered I only had a twenty left.  Well shit.  Couple of bills must have been stuck together when I bought my gas.  I went back to the gas station, walked in and asked the guy if I'd accidentally given him an extra twenty.  He said "No," but his smirk told me, "Fuck yes, and you aren't getting it back."

Bitcoin's "no takebacks" design has its benefits for businesses and individuals accepting BTC as currency, as it will prevent fraudulent chargebacks (which the author of this article is conveniently ignoring as a limitation of PayPal and credit cards).  I've heard so many horror stories of scammers winning an eBay auction, receiving their item, and then reversing the transaction (no proof required, in many PayPal cases), completely screwing the seller over, that I'm afraid to sell anything over the Internet.  Bitcoin solves this problem.  I hear of fraud running rampant right now, and what're the common routes?  Credit cards, cheques, Western Union et al, identity theft.  Bitcoin is exempt from the vulnerabilities exploited through these other routes.  Yeah, the irrevocability aspect can be exploited for fraud if you really want to get creative, but it applies to cash and commodities just as much as to Bitcoin.

Sounds like you can't afford to lose any money in investments.  Should probably stay out of Bitcoin.

It does, but I'm not sure the difference justifies the price.

The funny part about this is that mtgox used to be for trading MtG cards.
(Edit) Why is everything priced in Euros?

That sounds like a pretty bitchin' document.

It should be pretty intuitive that it doesn't mean 150%.  Fifty percent plus one is a fairly standard term when referring to any sort of majority, and as a single entity, it is impossible to control more than 100% of the network.

Uhhhh... so BTC would have been about $0.50 each back then.  Hope you got at least a few buck's worth, you'll be sitting pretty right about now.
