I think, like a lot of people, he sincerely believed that gox was just having technical difficulties and wasn't actually going to go completely belly up.

My point exactly. So why do we all suggest putting coins on things like coinkite, when we all know, the moment they get hacked they just fold like a house of cards.

We have seen before cold storage go missing. wouldn't be the first time. answer the question.

This makes no difference the URL is encrypted if it is over SSL.

Don't worry guys, everything is going to be fine. we'll open withdrawals soon.

~~If~~ when coinkite gets hacked, and loses 10k+ BTC of their users, will you be taking out a massive loan to cover the losses, or just fold like us?

yes, on the server side. there is nothing about what is shown in that screenshot that indicates that they are not hashing passwords on their server.

That isn't my official twitter that is a fake account. check the real twitter.

See my response above to the exact same point.

1) Local security is not the responsibility of the web server.  Most browsers store passwords to login to websites as well, should that also be the responsibility of the website?  If the local users account is pwned then there are much worse situations than loosing that password. CRIME/BEAST attacks to start, but the list goes on and is a mile long.
2) If the server is pwned and the attacked has access to private logs, there are much bigger problems on hand than seeing some user passswords in the log file.
The point is, the OP is making a mistake thinking that the password is being sent in plaintext. because if it is sent over POST/GET it is no different, SSL is SSL.  passwords are never hashed client side.

Just posted on my twitter to confirm this is me.

If there was never a cold wallet, they why didn't they loose everything they had in the 2011 hack?

It seems absolutely insane that they never did an audit during that whole time. mind = blown.
@_date: 2014-02-24 03:49:25
i bet you aren't the real doge doodle either.

Suckers! I told them to use my wallet code, months ago, but they just wouldn't listen.
