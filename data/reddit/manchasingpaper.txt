lol i just laugh at this entire subreddit now. look at all the downvotes for me .
guys, no shit you don’t wanna believe it crashing. your mind will not accept that, and will naturally get annoyed with me saying that as you have invested your money into what i’m saying is not worth investing in.
so i totally understand why no one likes talking about how the value is definitely going down over time and becoming more and more unstable. but it’s true
instead of downvoting and spam commenting “it’ll bounce back” with ZERO supporting argument of why it’s somehow showing long term growth and increasing value potential , can you actually say WHY it somehow is more likely to get stronger based on the data it’s been showing ever since it crashed?

i agree , it got extremely over hyped , inflated hard , crashed hard, inflated again because people were desperate for a 2nd skyrocket wave, and now its slowly just losing value over time

ya don’t say???? but if he does not immediately cash out, in 3 days his 700 can go to 400. EASILY. and it’s stupid to deal with that when you could have just gotten cash, ya know. which the value of stays steady for decades before very very slight changes
not to mention , he will have to pay coinbase a fee to even cash out this BTC to cash which is lulzy in itself.

OmegaLUL getting paid with a digital currency that can dip 100$ less in value in a day... don’t forget you also have to pay fees to even turn that btc into cash which is what you are gonna do. unless you just wanna hold on to it and eat all the upfront cost you spent to cater for them. smh

usually when that phrase is used it is under the assumption that the may part has already happened , and that you are saying “although this has happened, xxxxx”
he probably made the meme literally BECAUSE it failed yesterday.
kinda a moot point but you genuinely seemed to not get that
