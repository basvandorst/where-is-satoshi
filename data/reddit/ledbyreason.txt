Has critical thought in this sub died?  I told you that I am a Bitcoin holder, have been for years.  Don't accuse me of fearmongering!  I am being skeptical, which is how you should be when it comes to your investments as well. The stench of BS here is suffocating.  What are these "other solutions" you vaguely reference?
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:39:44
Jesus, what the hell is that all about?  I'm not bashing LN, I'm asking questions and expressing my concerns, and I'm hardly doing that mindlessly.  What claims have I that are not well-recognized or substantiated?  Which of your claims did I refute without evidence?  I HAVE studied LN a lot, and am skeptical about its ability to live up to its claims.  Skepticism--especially when 200 billion usd is involved--is a good thing!  I asked some questions, and for every response that I found helpful, I thanked the respondent.  Are we really at a point where polite skepticism elicits responses intended to shame the skeptic?  Seriously, what the hell happened to open discourse?

Where are you coming up with a 50% efficiency increase?  That seems to be a magic number based on no evidence.  Why not 80% or 15%?
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:09:59
I send dozens of BCH transactions per week, and none for more that 2¢. That's two cents.  Not dollars.  Cents.
Many wallets (like ledger's) have bad fee estimators still calibrated for the BTC network, so you have to set the fee manually on some wallets.
Check out Satoshi dice, it's a great example of what can exist on a low fee network.  The site used to work with BTC until a fee market was cultivated.  I'm happy to give you a little BCH if you want to try yourself, but I think the tipper bot has been disabled in this subreddit.  Find me in the BCH subreddit and I'll hook you up.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:06:49
It's inevitable.  Only geniuses could figure out a way to make a low fee blockchain.

I've spoken with devs who have said executing their business ideas on segwit Bitcoin took ten times as much code as executing in non-segwit Bitcoin.  Since they are devs, I believe them.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:03:07
Of course it's still your claim; you claimed it to be true!  I've done my homework; I know the  backwards and forwards.  SW adoption at 8% right now.  A shame segwit took on SO MUCH technical debt just to squeeze 0.8 mb more Tix into a block, especially when LN will require a hard fork for larger blocks anyway.  Just makes no sense.  Anyway, I doubt you'll get 100% segwit adoption anytime soon. I'm a BTC hodler and I do not want a segwit coin, I want the Bitcoin I paid for.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:21:34
Added complexity.  It makes future development harder.

It would take 15 years to get even just 1 billion people to open a lightning channel even if every transaction on the BTC chain we're used for that purpose.  Showing lightning can't work as promised is 6th grade math.  Don't go down with the ship.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:02:16
Lightning is alpha software and only meant for microtransactions.  Fortunately, several of the dev teams are working on solutions to lower fees that work today.

I wish I had the time.

@_date: 2018-01-07 21:13:14
1) That's BS.
2) Even if it were true, it allows no growth in transactions.  Currencies should have policies that encourage growth.  
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:20:23
And you received the funds? I've heard a lot of people say that they can't receive funds on lightning.

Have you done the math to show that BCH will "implode" on scale?  Bc I've done the math and am very confident that BCH will have no problem scaling for at least ten years.  And that's with today's tech.
@_date: 2018-01-24 03:05:43
Yeah, we'll bounce back from the all-time low market share in a snap!

Too bad lightning and segwit invite so much technical debt.  If only there was a safe path that was easy to implement.

They have been resolved.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:51:23
OP is using the same social shaming defense that many BTC maximalists employ.   This technique can be somewhat successful, but economics is more influencial, which is why many companies are switching to BCH despite the constant barrage of social attacks.  It is unlikely that you will be able to reason with OP.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:21:50
You should reread that very controversial study because it's claims are debated and you are misinterpreting it's conclusions.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:23:58
Litecoin has higher fees than BCH, will have the same scaling problems as BTC, and most importantly was not derived from the genesis block.  When I bought BTC, I bought the digital cash described in the whitepaper. Unfortunately, high fees and segwit have ruined that coin, but BCH can carry on the movement to bring financial independence to the people.  Have you read the whitepaper?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:19:42
You do not understand markets and competition.
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:46:54
Not sure what you're trying to say, but economics will beat the social consensus of a small group.  While the Bitcoin world might feel huge to BTCers, most people don't know anything about it.  And when those people feel like gambling and have the option of sending funds to the casino via BCH for 1¢ or via BTC for $40, which do you think they are going to choose?  BTC bc they are afraid of being shamed?  Surely you see how misguided that is?  High transaction costs are an attack vector.  I don't understand why BTC doesn't see that!?!
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:50:03
I didn't buy Monero at $3 because fluffypony was such a douche.  Didn't work out too well.

Have you read the white paper?
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:04:23
You have not presented evidence to refute a single claim that I've made.  If you're going to claim that I'm wrong, explain how, with evidence.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:18:55
The transaction backlog is approaching 300k, not 140k as you claim.  Segwit will not save BTC.  Lightning will not save BTC.  Do your own research.  Will YOU pay a transaction fee to open a lightning channel, lock your coins for a predetermined amount of time, be online all the time or risk losing a payment, AND pay another transaction fee to close the channel?  What will fees be by then?  They are expected to DOUBLE every 90 days.  I will not pay $100+ just to be able to transaction at low fees with the few other people who have also chosen to pay $100+ when so many other options exist.  Read the white paper.  This was not the plan.
And that does not even address the chicken and egg problem that LN faces.  It's not FUD if it's true.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 23:11:32
Companies built around Bitcoin even before they saw huge demand because they saw the promise of low-cost, permissionless payments.  Those are gone now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:52:02
Could you explain why BCH is not a nice alternative?  It has been working great for me.

@_date: 2018-09-13 23:29:55
This is pathetic.
@_date: 2017-12-31 15:55:54
"Have I read the developer's roadmap for scaling?"
Yes, and I've become convinced that 1) lightning network mapping problems will never be solved, 2) that lightning network is too complicated for most users and requires compromises (2 on-chain transactions, time-locked coins) that most users will find unacceptable, and 3) will likely require hubs to register as money-transmitters and have KYC regulations imposed.
Do you really think that lightning hubs will lead to less centralization than large blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:48:06
BCH may have blocks that are bigger than 1gb someday.  And by then, you'll still be able to run a node on an old laptop.  And who said that we were forgetting about payment channels (LN)?  Payment channels are not special to BTC.  Lots of blockchain will have their own.  Scaling shouldn't be black and white.  You can have on chain and off chain scaling.  Unless your developers' business plan relies on monetizing off chain scaling.
We're actually really reasonable and want to see as many people as possible included in the digital currency revolution.  Even those who can only afford 1-2¢ per transaction.  And if we don't make sure that happens, some other digital currency will.

Thanks for the resource.  I've looked through that but have not been able to find a specific tutorial that meets my needs.  Do you have any suggestions?
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:59:20
You guys are driving away speculators/ investors with this divided community nonsense.  The arguments on both sides have merit.  Fees are so high right now, that a lot of use cases are getting eliminated.  A dynamic block size market would likely solve that problem.  Segwit is likely a good addition to the protocol.  Honestly, I don't understand it well enough to judge for myself, but Andreas says it's a good idea and I trust him.  A reasonable compromise would benefit Bitcoin and all coin holders.
However, these constant ad hominem attacks from both sides make me seriously question whether this community is capable of making rational decisions.  As a speculator/ investor that scares me and prompted me to sell a third of my coins yesterday.  I will likely sell more today and continue selling until I see some progress being made in community members stepping away from their ideologically entrenched positions and start fairly trying to solve scaling challenge.
As a community member, these constant ad hominem attacks and misleading characterizations of the other side's position make me lament the loss of a once-awesome community, people whose ideas I enjoyed learning more about.

@_date: 2017-03-30 20:11:10
The implication of your comment is that one cannot divorce serious and important discussions from ad hominem attacks and childish rant posts.  I disagree and think that the current tone of the discussion will prevent any significant progress in the scaling debate, leading to a hard fork.  But at least you'll get cheap coins that way...  The problem is they'll probably stay cheap...
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:27:16
Okay, I can give that a try.  Is it custodial or how does it work?  I really only have interest in experimenting with setups that are as trustless as possible.

Genuinely curious: can you explain what aspect of bch is failed tech?  
@_date: 2017-08-03 15:06:46
Most Bitcoin Cash supporters are not against 2nd layer solutions; they just don't want small transactions priced off of the blockchain.  Like you, most Bitcoin Cash supporters want bigger blocks and second layer solutions.  The second layer solutions will require time to mature, though, and in the meantime we can easily make Bitcoin Cash transactions inexpensive by increasing the block size.
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:17:40
OP, what are your feelings on censorship in this forum?
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:41:42
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:53:56
OP makes very few good arguments.  Most of what he presents is an appeal to authority.  I'm not going to flush out both sides of the block size argument, because there have been many posts that have done it before.
But I would caution anyone with any significant amount of money in BTC to make sure you understand BTC, LN and other cryptos very well, especially their limitations and design tradeoffs.  Make sure you *use* BTC, LN and lots of other alternatives, so that you understand what they are like for users.
Do your own research.  Don't take someone's word on anything, as their incentives to argue a certain line of reasoning may not be obvious and may not align with your interests.
Lastly, don't use short-term price movements as evidence that a certain crypto is better or worse than others.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:01:20
I stated that I was not going to rehash (pun intended) the arguments, because they are well-represented in other threads.  The only argument I made is that speculators in this space should understand the tech, the tradeoffs, and the user experiences of many chains if they are going to have skin in the game.  I bought Bitcoin before the split and held at least some of both.  Reasonable people may come to different conclusions about which chain is best to speculate on at this point.
I don't believe that I made an ad hominem, even after rereading my response.  Feel free to point it out if you still feel that I did.

Low demand for space in a block and low value of the BTC token in USD terms.  This is good news for individuals trying to perform transactions, but bad news for the network.
@_date: 2019-01-05 16:51:09


[The data that I can access contradicts that claim](  If you have other data to support your claim, please cite it.


By your reasoning, there is no price that would indicate stagnated growth.

This medium piece is very one-sided and does not consider the history of Bitcoin at all.  There are many of us who think that BTC has strayed so far from the vision described in the whitepaper that it should no longer be considered Bitcoin.
