so you want only large institutions to be able to run bitcoin? that is the exact meaning of centralization, and the opposite of the purpose of bitcoin.

attacks want to destroy bitcoin in many ways.
I'm pointing out one way it could get destroyed: by a huge blockchain, that will make it more centralized. that's all.

30 gb? not convenient, you need a large hard disk, but fine.
30 tb? its not going to be easy to store it.

Not true. miners need the full blockchain in order to verify that the transactions that they are inserting into the blockchain are valid and will be accepted by other miners.

If the block size is 8mb-20mb, there can be a cooperation of several big pools in order to always push big blocks, to increase the size of the blockchain rapidly and FOREVER and prevent competition from smaller miners.
Or, alternatively, a spam attack on the network without any fees (thus, free attack), just to make 8mb blocks....
I do agree that there should be a minimum fee. but i believe that it should be based on the market. thus, in the time of the attack, the fee will need to be higher. in time where there is no attack, the fee can be lower.

20mb every 10 minutes &gt; 1mb every 10 minutes
