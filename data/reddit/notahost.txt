What was the asic boost loophole that was fixed? I hadn’t herd of it.

I mean, from my quick reading it seems like he was reselling an American made product? The company making them eventually agreed to stop producing them and never even got a fine? 
I’m not sure if I’d go after a reseller as a first step, unless I misread something? Was he selling them after the company shut down?

What method doesn't led to centralization? I'm not aware of many, but my assumption is that in any case, if you have vast resources, you can centralize to some degree.

Great counterargument. Very informative. 
Buying mining equipment is tying up your assets. The nice part is that even in the event of a crash, you have assets. The spring 14 crash though, the video cards dropped in price severely, so you can still take a significant loss. I remember 290X going for $800-900 that spring and then selling for $200 after the crash.
You also have to account for the market. As your earning money in coins, if its going up you could have made out with a lot more by investing into the coins themselves, as it can take 6-8 months to recover. If it the market turns and the miner still has all his coins, then you could still be significantly negative from assets devaluation and electricity costs. 
Overall I do enjoy mining more, its an enjoyable hobby and almost a competition to improve efficiency, but it does carry risks and it can tie up your assets.

The drop doesn't mean anything unless you discuss how much you invested. When the $200 drop occurs and you own 30 bitcoins or if the $6000 drop occurs and you own 1 bitcoin, you lost the same. 
It's also the same if you own .3 bitcoin and .01 bitcoin for those two drops. People tend to purchase/sell more bitcoins when the value is cheaper.

Ah, well using the numbers $15K -&gt; $9K right now was coincidental enough to be easily confused with the value of the bitcoin. 
Percentages are generally more relevant to tell the performance of a portfolio over a dollar amount. Telling you I made or lost $15K means little if I invested $300K. Those who already have more money are generally going to have larger absolute gains.

I've never understood how people look at anything besides percentages. I hear people bitching all the time about how expensive a google stock is or an amazon stock is. They also make statements like STOCK went up X dollars today! Even sillier when you compare to bitcoin where you can buy less than 1 unit.
