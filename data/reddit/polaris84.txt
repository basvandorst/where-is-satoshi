Well talk about confusing...
The watch-only wallet has the complete historial with the correct balance. The offline wallet historial is blank.

Thanks for the kind help!
I did the cold storage watch-only wallet process from the electrum guide.
What set off my alarm, is that when I put the watch wallet receive address on the block explorer, it has 0 BTC (fair enough, it is a watch wallet), but when I put the cold storage wallet address on the explorer, it has a lesser amount that what it should have!
I'm not concerned about privacy atm, only on my funds not being lost.

Yes, the watch-only wallet has the correct balance and history. The cold wallet is in an always offline laptop, so I think that is why its history is blank.
Been using this explorer:

You don't understand the TCP/IP protocols, and here you are insulting me, now, that's a system that works.

It is so transparent that you can see your money locked away for an eternity, yay?

Yes, now I know, thanks.

I suppose the system are the wallet developers, and the btc architecture. If a wallet developer is reading this, it would be nice if there was a mandatory minimum fee.
