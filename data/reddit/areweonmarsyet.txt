Where did I mention anything about other country's? I'm just saying America is a oligarchy not that every other country isn't

I've been waiting for my tenx card for a while now but it seems like it's gonna take a while before I get one with the wavecrest stuff. actually paying for stuff with crypto is a huge missing factor for me right now

As soon as I can properly pay with Bitcoin I'll transfer my pay directly to my btc wallet. I'm looking into buying a tenx debit card that is supposed to let me pay with Bitcoin and if that works out I'll be super happy

From my point of view the main chain is the one that didn't fork the other one. But what annoys me is that the arguments from rely on their claim to the Bitcoin name way to much. If Bitcoin cash is better in the long run it won't matter Bitcoin is the main chain.

Or "Bitcoin" is the name given to the main chain and trying to hijack btc is confusing and petty. I was interested in Bitcoin cash but I got turned off by the constant stream of "operation Dragonslayer will kill Bitcoin" and "the flippening is coming" or "Bitcoin cash is the real Bitcoin". 
The Bitcoin cash subreddit is the only place where I see people believing Bitcoin has to die for their coin to survive (not all people ofcource) and it's made me not want to participate.

I don't get the religious "one true coin" mindset some people seem to have. The crypto space is big enough for multiple coins to succeed and fill different niches. I hodl several coins I think are going to find a spot in the market and grow alongside Bitcoin in the future.
