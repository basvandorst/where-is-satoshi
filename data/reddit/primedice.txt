Indeed, although don't forget the other kind of people who just want to use Greece to boom up the price so they can dump and control more coins later. Everyone is selfish, selfish people in groups can do a lot more harm though. :P

Profit is what drives people to create great things. This isn't a fair way to think of things. 
Changetip has created an amazing service that is very user friendly. Soon there will probably be competition to it offering lowered fee's. Maybe one day there will be so much competition that someone will make a free version of it. However until then they deserve to profit off the new extremely well implemented system.
