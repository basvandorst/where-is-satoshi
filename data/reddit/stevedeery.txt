Or it was posted as useful information. Certainly how I read it - but I’m not a grievance looking for a cause

But why would this matter to those buyers in Korea, etc? The US is a large portion of the market, but not the market.

I looked at Revolut when first cam out - probably have an account. Just a little wary of smaller organisations when talking 6 fig sums. But I'll re-visit, thanks

Slightly baffled by the number of people on this forum who are BTC naysayers. Why are they here? Also the numbers commenting on BTC who seem to know precious little about BTC, but still seem to express an opinion on its capabilities. I guess everyone is entitled to an opinion.  Luckily I don't have to treat them all as if of equal value.

Consider 'value' as a noun and 'value' as a verb. The former is bitcoins  importance, or utility; in the broadest sense. The latter is an estimate of its the monetary worth.  Both can fluctuate. So price, contrary to what others say, DOES represent bitcoins value, and it DOES NOT represent bitcoins value depending on which sense of value you are using.

I see that SlushPoll has lost around 32,000 Miners this past couple of weeks between 12-15% of the entire pool. Doesn't really matter only illustrative of the current climate. Can only assume the rest of Slush Pools' miners are living in the land of super cheap power, or using someone elses :)
