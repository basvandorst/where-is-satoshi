I did not know Steam accepted BTC, that's actually a pretty big deal! 
p.s. appropriately cyberpunk selection!

Yes, this is called arbitrage. However, with how quickly the market moves, the time it takes to move funds, and the transaction fees involved, you're not very likely to make a significant amount of profit unless you're dealing in huge sums and happen to get lucky with regard to timing the market.

I heard about it in 2010. I can't remember where, probably a forum or something. I wanted to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin because I loved the idea of a decentralized currency but was scared away by rumors of wallets getting hacked. Still kicking myself.

I think OP meant the game cost 0.001 BTC, not the fee. The game is on sale for $3.99 at the moment, which adds up.

It's a typo of "hold" (as in don't sell). I believe it originated from [this thread]( on the bitcointalk forum.

"Huge sums" is a relative term - there's no single answer to it. All I meant was a 2% (for example) arbitrage opportunity is only going to make you a lot of money (in absolute terms) if you throw a much larger amount of money at it. In that example you'd be making $2 profit (in a perfect world without fees) for every $100 you invest. See what I mean? 
Arbitrage is about timing the market. In a perfect world where you could instantaneously execute a trade, it wouldn't be as much about timing, but it's still based on timing to find the arbitrage opportunity in the first place. Given that you can't send BTC from one exchange to another *and* execute the trade instantaneously, and crypto markets are extremely volatile, you're betting on the price difference between the two exchanges either staying the same or increasing in your favor by the time you can execute the trade. 
Like everything - risk and luck is involved. There is "no free lunch".
