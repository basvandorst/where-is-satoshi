You doing the right thing. He can afford to lose the money and the upside is huge.

The fact the the most influential man in the world is discussing BTC shows how influential BTC has become. Anybody who has used the SWIFT payment system and waited days for it to be received with layers and layers of costs and then made a BTC payment proves its value. The deflationary nature is pure economic genius from Satoshi. Low supply and high demand = long-term store of value. An indestructible network, with the profits spread out amongst millions of miners, and not in the hands of the greedy corporates and governments is unstoppable. These are the last few months in Bitcoins history that the average person around the world could even think of owning 1 Bitcoin. You see bitcoin cash machines popping up in shopping centers and more and more major online retailers adopting the technology. If you get in before the halvening on 20 May 2020, I don’t see a $ 300 000 bitcoin as unrealistic in the near future.

@_date: 2019-11-14 21:21:00
I agree
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:50:21
Bitcoin has no rival due to 1) the network effect required to build the back bone of the mining network 2) its decentralized nature 3) its limited supply.
@_date: 2019-11-10 15:59:09
Good article. Still bullish IMO
@_date: 2019-11-28 18:53:12
Not bad at all. No other altcoin offers the unique benefits of Bitcoin. I think most of them will disappear like the dotcom bust in 2001.
@_date: 2019-11-04 17:55:42
I have dollar cost averaged every month since April. I think this is a golden time to buy BTC before the FOMO kicks in around the  halvening period in May 2020.  Save BTC my friend.
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:30:55
I’m not. Is says the word “mindset”

He was totally clueless. He never even mentioned or understood the diminishing supply. Fake news media at their best
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:45:44
Well done! The first BTC is like your first million. Impossible to reach at first, and then easier and easier to accumulate the rest
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:44:53
Are you all in? If so what price you enter?

Scarcity limits supply which, given an increase in demand, could see the BTC price go through the roof in the next decade
@_date: 2019-08-30 13:42:34
If you compare the SWIFT payment system to Bitcoin payments you would understand the true nature of Bitcoin’s advantages in terms of speed, cost and privacy. You will see Bitcoin in your daily life when the medium of exchange function becomes realistic in a few years time when the volatility settles.

I bought $ 400 so perhaps you should not complain if the rest of us are stashing the sats
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:13:00
People talk about BTC as Gold 2.0 more than a new currency. It fluctuates too wildly in price and the scaling issues for transactions means that BTC is seen more as a speculative asset type store of value than the other 2 functions of money.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:51:11
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:45:59
Yup. You literally have to check your emotions in at the door or you get rekt
@_date: 2019-08-31 18:32:33
That’s why Satoshi made BItcoin divisible by a million. That way if it’s $5m a coin, it could still be used as medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:46:50
Big run ahead for Alts. They have a had a nasty time of things with BTC stealing their thunder
@_date: 2019-08-13 06:13:26
Great move. That’s why they call us HODLERS
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:10:59
I think it’s currency function will come later as they sort out the scaling issues.

It’s amazing how people just don’t get Bitcoin and it’s potential. I am en economist and I specialize in monetary theory. The minute I read the Bitcoin concept I was sold. Blockchain will no doubt start the next industrial revolution and Bitcoin will be looked at in awe when people realize what they could have bought into but instead scorned and ridiculed. It’s like Noah telling everyone about the floods and nobody believing him. Except this flood will make even a 0.2 BTC holder wealthy beyond his wildest dreams.
@_date: 2019-10-10 19:12:12
Go all in at this price.
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:10:10
I am
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:45:09
Very excited. It will never happen again tho
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:45:49
Agreed. I’m a BTC maximalist
@_date: 2019-08-27 16:13:07
Agreed. It’s nice to know that all the smart money is on the long-term future and checking your account obsessively is a waste of time
@_date: 2019-10-06 16:49:55
Absolutely brilliant read. Worth the time. Beautiful
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:48:08
Lol. First you save 6.15 BTC, then you wait for it to moon. Then you retire and and order as much as your heart desires
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:46:10
If the price is low you go all in. Nothing wrong
@_date: 2019-10-27 05:52:39
A “theoretical” profit obviously if you don’t sell
@_date: 2019-10-27 05:54:20
Have u seen the $ 10 m dollar bitcoin endgame on YouTube? That’s when!!
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:56:54
I couldn’t agree with you more. 1998 Asian crisis. 2001 dotcom bubble bursts. 2008 Property crisis. 2022 global currency crisis? That last trigger will see BTC adopted as the true internet of money
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:53:33
Couldn’t agree with you more. I have a fair amount of my assets in BTC. I get anxiety when it goes parabolic as I know my next purchase of BTC could yield a fraction compared to its previous levels. If you can be excited for both the up and down, the technology works and you HODL you talking moon money the next halving in 2024
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:25:56
HODL all the way my friend. Murphy’s law you sell BTC and try buy it back after it goes parabolic and you get shut out.  Could happen.
@_date: 2019-10-27 07:17:35
Once you all in then you can pray for the $ 100 k BTC
@_date: 2019-12-01 19:14:45
I’ll sell my first BTC when the price reaches $ 325 000 / BTC . This means BTC would have the same market cap as gold.
@_date: 2019-09-18 07:20:52
Good luck my friend. A wise decision. I have 50% of my assets in BTC and trying to take it higher. It’s an opportunity once in a lifetime to get in at these rates. If I lose everything it will be ok. I’m comfortable taking this level of risk
@_date: 2019-09-01 12:05:33
How do you define “good person” without religion and any objective standards of measure? Maybe throwing your children into the fire, like they did with the  idol Baal, was the measure of “good person “ in biblical times. Beings a good person is not good enough unless being a good person is defined and categorized.
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:57:04
So if nobody wants to spend their BTC on food cos they HODLers do the poor birds starve to death?
@_date: 2019-09-13 07:55:09
You have been reported
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:47:49
It’s not  just scarcity that creates price it’s also the demand for the utility of the underlying asset - of which I’m sure your wife’s shells and rocks are beautiful, but doesn’t create much value.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:21:34
The economics is simple. Too many dollars printed causes an over supply and a weakening of a currency. This could be dollars, pounds euros whatever currency floats your boat. People will then switch to a more stable currency called Bitcoin. Its stable because it’s deflationary in nature. This is because their is a limited supply of 21 million BTC and its issue is based on a computer protocol not any corrupt politician or faulty economic model. Let’s say the dollar is worthless. It means that a country will then price its goods in fractions of Bitcoins called Satoshi. See no dollar involved. Why? Cos the dollar is worthless hence the reason people buy and sell goods using Bitcoin as dollars or pounds or euros will no longer exist.

Post it so we can read it?
@_date: 2019-09-02 09:14:04
What I am trying to say is as follows: Is it easier to buy 1 BTC at $ 10 k or at $ 100 k
@_date: 2019-09-15 09:08:18
Very insightful and well put together!!
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:13:16
It will be measured in Satoshis as dollars will be worthless. You never did economics 1?

My advice. Buy BTC and HODL using dollar cost averaging. Don’t go near mining. It requires  cheap electricity, noise reduction technology, sensors and a trouble shooting/ electronic background.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:59:05
Supply and demand. The price, in theory, will skyrocket as the supply halves every 4 years. Demand could increase if most global fiat currencies collapse or weaken due to the devaluation caused by printing too much of them. Or if the world accepts Bitcoin as the internet of money and / or if there is collapse in equities / bonds / properties.  In economics a simultaneous lower supply and higher demand skyrockets prices. Hence the $ 1m Bitcoin. Or $ 10m let’s hope.
@_date: 2019-09-01 11:59:05
BTC today is the opportunity of a life time and the window of opportunity will close within the next 3-5 years. Throw the dice my friend. I am.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:11:33
Cos it would buy the equivalent of $ 10 m worth of goods or services or similar other fiat currency whether dollar or not.
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:51:36
Best article I have read this year explaining the complexities of BTC in such a simple way. Well done sir.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:12:04
To the moon! Come BTC. Well written
@_date: 2019-09-01 12:10:46
You will never achieve the “network”effect that propelled Bitcoin into its no 1 spot. Their is no Facebook 2. Once you big enough, you are unstoppable. The altcoins being rekt is showing us this. The real power of BTC is its decentralized network and ability by virtue of its sheer size, has no risk of a 51% attack.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:07:49
If the global markets allow us to transact in BTC then yup, the dollar will be irrelevant
@_date: 2019-09-13 06:52:43
Yes. Banning harmful untested vaping is not the same as banning BTC. Some clueless lefty conflated the two.
@_date: 2019-09-01 06:51:43
Ps - if you are going to mine anyway, use the Whatsminer M20S using solar and immersion cooling. Go to  They will guide you on the specifics
@_date: 2019-09-07 19:06:18
People who don’t believe in Bitcoin won’t touch it. At least 3% - 5% of ones investable assets should be in Bitcoin. I have 50% of my investable assets in BTC and if I lose every cent it’s a risk reward calculation I’m comfortable with. The next 5-10 years could be life changing for BTC hodlers.

Bill Gates recently said very positive things about BTC. He was impressed with the fact that you could transfer large sums of money without the transaction fees of gold. He was pretty much arguing BTCs medium of exchange function. It was good to hear this view point as people often focus on its store of value function (ie Gold 2.0)
