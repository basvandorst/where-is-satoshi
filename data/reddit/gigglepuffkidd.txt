but how much more efficient? is it wrong to just spend idle time or to convert old hardware to this purpose? im not trying to make a living off of bitcoins, i just want to generate them.

ok i answered some of my own questions and by using this: 
in 1 year i would create ~1/1000 of a bitcoin and it would cost me about 50 dollars... 
i guess it isn't worth it. thanks for the help guys

yes i gathered that time frame is a huger issue then i first imagined. to make 3.6 BTC it would somewhere near 18million days of 100% uptime...  i really appreciate your help though as i finally was able to get some info on how to set it up and also the futility of doing so in such a small scale.

certainly, i looked at the link you gave me and it actually cleared up quite a bit of this problem of understanding i have. i wasn't too concerned with running my machine 24/7 but if you look at the post over all i figured that for about 50 dollars a year i would create less then 1/1000 of a BTC which isn't including the original cost of the computer. so it isn't worth it. thanks for your link.

ok so a couple people have mentioned its just easier to go and buy them instead of trying to compete with other miners. but why can't i take hardware that i would otherwise have no use for (old gaming rigs, company server boxes) and convert them to miners? even if i am making 3.6 BTC isn't that still making something? im starting to realize im not looking at the near term at all. im thinking about at the point where no more BTC can be created and at that point wouldn't it be better to have manufactured it yourself on hardware that would otherwise have become trash?
ok so i can't make thousands of bitcoins per day, so what? is it really that big of a waste of money to try and generate them on your own? im looking at the link bbbbbbubble posted and trying to assess the costs but im not seeing any hit that i would take other then time to configure? am i missing something here?

the prospect of bitcoin is very intriguing to me. firstly the fact that there can only be a certain amount of bitcoins and that that amount has not yet been reached is one of them. also being the first digital currency and having the ability to freely go and "create" it for the time being is too good to pass up. worst case scenario, i pay a little higher electric bill and i wear out a GPU/CPU that was going to wear out at some point anyway.
best case is that i grab onto the first digital currency and produce some manner of income for myself. whether that is now or in the future for posterity.
is that the wrong reason?
i understand that it is a competitive operation actually and that is why i want in on it. i also understand that it is over my head at the moment, but that hasn't stopped me before so why now?
thanks for the tip about butterfly labs though.
edit: thanks*

thanks for the link. im not trying to make money with it. how can i explain this... it might sound stupid but you have to spend money to make money and given that i would like to lose some now to gain some in the future. whats the harm in farming my own bitcoins, storing them for a long period of time and then releasing them later? is that even possible?
@_date: 2013-08-22 20:21:23
so my next question is where is the best place to buy them?
