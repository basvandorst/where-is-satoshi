Could we hit 100k tho?
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:15:26
Aye I like that
@_date: 2019-10-27 01:28:43
The ebay option but only a fool would buy it. E wast would be the legal and most environmentally friendly way to get rid of it.
@_date: 2019-10-27 23:32:47
Hmm interesting
@_date: 2019-06-25 02:50:40
Okay cool, thanks mate!
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:30:25
Ah understandable, it made me and my mates go, "wtf is wrong with that guy?" Lol
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:41:56
We ended up contacting wish and their just going to refund us the money within 14 business days.
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:00:26
Sweet thanks mate
@_date: 2019-12-04 22:58:35
Well the 570 is an 8pin GPU so I'll have to use an adapter. If I posted in a shitcoin form I wouldn't get any help lol. Maybe in a ETH form I might tho.
@_date: 2019-12-31 00:01:57
We cant unfortunately, original packaging was thrown away ��
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:17:02
Why would I do that to, I thought it was like normal stocks to where I buy low and sell high?
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:24:31
Autocorrect. It's supposed to be stats and yes I do know it doesnt seem like mining will improve but I do have Hope's. It was only 30$ after all. It mines in this market right now at 1.50$ so it would only take me 15 days and I dont have to worry about power as complex includes it in rent.
@_date: 2019-09-19 05:41:08
It's not stealing as everyone knows its split 8 different ways.
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:02:29
Google play doesnt allow mining apps anymore. Its a APK file and the coin is called MIB Coin. Go to Mibcoin(dot)io for the download. Its alot of Korean but translated pretty well. I like the concept as my old phones no longer do nothing for me. Trades are not the best as it's at 75 satoshi per coin but after awhile you can make some good profit.
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:59:47
I'm not paying for phone's, there old ones laying around doing nothing. They have no service and running off wifi. I see this a pear profit.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:21:54
Yes, yes they are. At least we can agree on that.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:21:22
For now. I'll be putting it into my garage at a different location as this thing is LOUD AF.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:55:49
Will do. Thankyou for not being such a d*ck on this post, many others are for some reason lol
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:07:20
No problem mate. I mine it mainly because I like the concept.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:49:33
Well when it get fully up and running it mines about 5$ a day it just doesnt stay on at this moment (going to investigate further)  but by it passing just the 3$ mark I make profit. When I posted this I just got it and say it turned on.
@_date: 2019-09-19 01:50:04
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:27:26
I realize that, so it's going to be going to my garage at a different location where power is split 8 ways meaning I pay only 0.015 of a cent per kilowatt.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:48:47
Lmao, I just cashed out. I sold when it was down at 7500 yesterday.
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:14:37
I had about 100 or so but took it out cus it kept on going down. I now regret that. Should of kept it in.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:03:19
Man if I had 100 BTC I wouldn't be here right now lmao
But no it was 100$
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:28:01
Nah I was to young to know anything about cryptocurrency back in 2013. I am now 18.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:23:38
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:32:08
Eh true on that.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:45:17
I'm glad I'm not the only one who's noticed that.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:28:13
I think it's going to go down big time throughout this week coming up now because of this.
