I would imagine a major obstacle would be the cost in BTC for all of the transaction fees that would be generated.

Hmm. I might be a Trump administration supporter, I might not be. I might a strong constitutionalist conservative, or I might be a progressive, socialist democrat. 
All of that comes _after_ being a freedom loving American, and for that reason, Trump, _you’re fired_.

He said he has a few hundred dollars worth of litecoin, and is asking if he should keep it or exchange it for bitcoin.
I’d say exchange it, but if you’re looking for a quick buck, might be worth holding on to, as I think short term, litecoin’s price may get quite volatile, and provide you a higher exchange rate than where it currently rests.

The news will not be directly BTC related, as you know, but I agree will still affect the price. However, paradoxically, I think it will skew the price in our favor. I’d imagine the rumor-news cycle would be better applied to FB stock, rather than BTC.

GTX1080s are not that powerful, and GPU mining of bitcoin has long been made obsolete by ASIC miners. If you joined a pool, you’d probably still be better off using a CPU miner application (of course dependent on your CPU), and could not speculate on the ROI. But lets pretend its a COTS server with a new age dual-octacore processor, it’ll be like $3, maybe.

Yeah, unfortunately I don’t think any of us would be surprised with that course of action. As cheesy as it sounds, as long as you believe in the vision, the true freedom of money (and not to mention the inevitable impending recession), the short term does not dictate the long term.

Strong move up or down comes today. Not sure when, but popular times are 1400-1800 UTC.
@_date: 2019-06-03 22:11:45
If judging by pattern, I’d agree. Within the next 6 hours (use 6h candle markers on CBP). However, could go the other way as well.
@_date: 2019-06-06 12:12:41
Should have been more specific with my arbitrary price prediction. Strong move indicating a price change &gt;= 5% off of 24 hour.

Don’t do it. No matter what. I’ve sold tons via Paypal, and ANYONE can do a chargeback and claim “they” really didn’t buy it. You’ll be left bitcoin-less and “dollar”-less, and they’ll have both.

Coinbase- better API, functional app, (arguably) better UI/UX, integrates with some big names already (Fidelity), excellent (relative to crypto industry) support in USA
Binance- Supports WAY more altcoin pairings, international, doesn’t require ID on sign up (might have changed?), has more room to grow since not massively established in USA (yet), lower fees if using BNB

It will be very interesting to watch the events that occur at $10k breaking. No doubt, more sell orders will pop up, but as of now, there are very large resistance walls up to $10k (from here at $9550), that are effectively 3x the size of those between $10k and $16k. Could move unbelievably quickly, and would make for an excellent viewing party!!!

BeakMeat is correct, but assuming you mean if your average machine (again, varies) joins a pool... no, it is generally not profitable if you don’t have subsidized electricity. However, if you do have subsidized electric, yes, it is of course profitable even on a weaker PC, but you won’t be gaining much. Maybe upwards of 50c per day (with some new gen i7s). 
The real profit is had by buying professional grade ASIC miners (in this case, machines built specifically for SHA256 brute forcing, with some optimizations built in), or by mining and then holding the coins purchased, assuming they will increase in price. A combination of both is optimal, but then again, who has that sorta money?
@_date: 2019-06-13 23:13:16
Maybe. I guess it depends on if you’re converting to USD first or not- if the vendor is accepting BTC directly, I would assume not.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:32:30
Agree 90%, but for anyone reading, an important distinction is the bitcoin supply- 21 million is a naive approach. All coins mined today sit at about 17MM, and conservative estimates say that about 3MM coins have been lost/burned/tainted. Even more are forever hodled, waiting for the switchening (bitcoin in use as primary currency) to occur. So, true supply sits much, much lower.

We should start referring to ‘em as Piccolos.

If anyone has a hard time hodling at these prices and their coin is still on an exchange, a good idea would be to invest in a hardware wallet (if it makes it any easier, use some of your crypto to purchase it). It’ll give you some needed piece of mind, provide you security, and prevent you from making poor decision-based trades.
(Bonus: the conspiracy theorist in me says it will also raise the price of the coin... but certainly for a different discussion).

Bitcoin either plummets or spikes within 24 hours. This low volume and lessening volatility seems to be indicating that recently.

Conceptually nothing. I’d just be sure you’re using some sort of strong encryption algorithm.
Operations-wise, the bootable USB would need to be plugged in to something that has a configurable BIOS to boot from USB, and you’re likely not gonna have any sort of interface on the USB itself (unlike a hardware wallet). Kiss any sort of support goodbye as well, in the event something happens (although I’d imagine you wouldn’t need it, seeing as that you’re asking this question).
Oh, and make sure that USB is from a trusted manufacturer.

Could be overnight tonight, with news articles in the morning screaming “whale bought 10,000 btc from Kraken and CBP overnight,” or could be next year after a dramatic fall to $1,500. No one knows, but it is likely not what anyone is predicting nor telling you.
@_date: 2019-06-09 03:34:59
I think the adoption argument is quite valid. If you can purchase things for BTC, and I mean truly purchase everyday things (from groceries to cars to houses and services in between), then even whales will switch to using BTC to pay for their desires, like watches, massages, and yachts, with crypto. At that point, there’s no “cashing out.” Just further dissemination.
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:33:02
Sorta, but especially so because you posted that you have 1 btc on a specific exchange. Someone could use some social engineering, or just some tracing, to figure out who you are, where you live, and what you do. from there, the sky’s the limit, from password brute forcing, to blackmailing, to whatever. 
Moreover, don’t think of this “bad guy” as some crook, because one day, they could even be state actors. Imagine for a second you are accused of a crime. Just. Accused. And the FBI orders the freezing of your accounts. Hence, there are generally two rules to follow:
1) Keep your keys permanently accessible.
2) Never tell anyone how much btc you have (stay away from orders of magnitude, too)
Hope this provided some sort of logical reasoning.

No, no fees from moving from coinbase to pro and back. They are essentially the same entity, just one has an interface meant for “pro” users (and access to programmatic api, etc), and the other has a more basic, graphically appealing interface meant to appeal to casual users.
