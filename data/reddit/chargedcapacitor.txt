Bigger blocks are only bad in the long run. That is to say, the size of the blockchain will increase faster than the average consumer electronic storage device price decreases, which leads to only large systems being able to run a node.
It is to my understanding that lightning nodes are large to begin with, but do not increase in size in the same way as creating bigger blocks does. So that makes it more future / centralization proof.

I love stories like these. I had something like this happen to me and my Xapo wallet from 2013. I had to log reset a password to an old email account, then reset my Xapo password. I ended up having $11USD in it.

Luckily for you, just because it has a password does not mean it is encrypted. Like others have said, you  just need to pop that hard drive into another computer, and explore it like you would a USB drive. Congrats! you now have access to your files!
Please update us on how it turns out:)

Im gonna go out on a limb and guess that you have never stepped foot into any of the hundreds of classes around the world that offer courses in cyber security/compsci. Because if you did, you would know that SHA 256 encryption has no back-doors, has no flaws exploitable by today's tech, and has thousands of people who understand it down to every Boolean logic gate. That alone blows this piece out of the water. 
Second part: The block-chain network is the heart of all cryptocurency, and without it, bitcoin would have zero resilience compared to what it has now. So just because the NSA has a paper that explains how secure P2P comms can facilitate currency transfer, by no means does that mean it had a hand in developing bitcoin to rule the world.

They have really high fees, but you can use GDAX with your coinbase account. Their fees are way lower. Just transfer your USD or BTC using GDAX's deposit feature.

Rule of thumb is don't but near the all time high, especially if the money your investing is vital to your retirement.

Their the same company. I'm just guessing, but you can only use bank transfers or wired Bank transfers with gdax, but with coinbase you can use credit or debit, and get your money into coins faster. And yes, you can transfer your coins to gdax without transferring back to usd.

I think that once we reach the Big One, the cursor should be changed to a rocket ship!
