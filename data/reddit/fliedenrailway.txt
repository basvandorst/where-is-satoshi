I think I can agree with that. I could probably even go so far as to ask whether the utility of the thing *even makes sense for people to use* (i.e. other than an academic exercise) without the values inherent in the design. I.e. would Bitcoin work almost nearly exactly the same if it didn't, say, have a 21M cap? Sure. But what would the community and resultant opinion of the utility be? Maybe the similar demand, may be not though. So I think I see where you're coming from there.

I'm curious why, in general, a business would take a loan to hire people? Why wouldn't you be able to pay your bills and employees before taking on more debt. Just seems backwards unless you're talking about startup environments. But those rarely get loans: usually just venture/angel capital as startups are too risky for loans proper.

Yeah we sorta got off on a tangent on the nature of democracy and stuff.


Well, you mentioned that jails weren't for *punishment*. And I said that they have been, and they are, and purposefully so by society's desire. Not completely of course but it is, and I think undeniably, an aspect of the justice system.


Whole heartedly agree.


That may be so, but that doesn't mean the average person should never get a voice in how such things are decided on. For example I'm not a lawyer but I know for a fact that some laws would be better off different or non-existent. So under what you're saying because I don't have some certification that says I'm "specialized" or whatever I should never be allowed to participate or partake in challenging or changing those laws? Yet I'm also expected to be governed by and abide by those rules. That just seems wrong to me — that because I'm not "ordained" or "special" I'm treated differently.


While I agree we wouldn't want to regress into corporal punishment without trial or anything I think we're talking about the sentencing itself — after verdict has been reached. Whether the King decreed you were guilty or a jury judged you so, the punishment has always had a element of retribution.
I guess my whole point is that while I think it works against humanity and it's (hopeful) enlightenment as a species in the future I just can't see the retribution/punishment element going away from justice systems any time soon. It's too human.
Talking about average people though I find it falls into two camps really: (usually conservatives) who want to see harsh punishments as a form of criminal deterrent and (usually liberals) who see criminals as merely broken or misguided and want to fix/rehabilitate those people. Each side has pros and cons. I tend to learn towards the latter, but recognize without other societal reform it can be for naught in some cases.
The punishment/retribution aspect is, for the most part, for the parties involved (e.g. the victim or related family). For example there are often financial judgements where we take from some entity and give it to another *because of the wrong done*. That is the very nature of retribution I think. THe very act of taking away freedom (jail) is a form of retribution I'd argue.
I haven't done much reading on the subject but given the current state of human nature it'd be hard to imagine a world where a purely rehabilitative justice system could work. Especially for repeat offenders.

It's a long thread by I think your original premise was that it [isn't useful as as a currency]( It is useful as a currency: the fact that *any* meaningful transactions happen with Bitcoin is proof of that. And there are and it does. You're trying to argue relative relevance. Which I think we'd probably agree apon. Bitcoin ain't taking on VISA anytime soon.
However your second point here: usefulness as a currency has nothing to with Bitcoin or it's valuation? Could you explain that? If you mean that it's usefulness as a medium of exchange isn't really related to it's current fiat exchange rate then I'd agree. What do you draw that from that conclusion (assuming I got your point right)? Do you mean bitcoin ought not be "valuated"? (Sorry just taking a stab at your short sentance).

I'd say this is a go: if you can get a WA state money transmitter license then, yes, you can operate a Bitcoin ATM.

The existing system of credit/debit and EFTPOS has been the only system   (especially for in-person purchases) for many decades. It's entrenched. So saying everybody else agrees (that the fees are negligible) just seems dishonest.
I'd bet it's closer to most people just assuming "that's the way it's done." However if you told people that their airline miles or credit card benefits are rolled into that 3% then indeed I think some folks would opt for it.

@_date: 2014-02-15 08:36:38
I assume you're talking about this bit of that [specific post](


I dont think that's accurate. The transaction is **not** *invalid*. It has simply mutated. The address paid still gets paid. The problem lies in the fact that BitPay won't necessarily *know* they've been paid[1] despite their address being credited the correct amount of Bitcoins.
The is because BitPay (or any wallet/exchange/software/etc.) is using[1] the TXID (transaction ID) to keep track of transactions. Because the TXID can be changed using the transaction malleability attack the *tracking* of who has been paid is screwed up, not the actual payment.
Think about it like this: it's like BitPay was tracking serial numbers on dollar bills to track who paid for what. But before the dollar bills hit the actual till someone can maliciously change the serial numbers on the bills screwing up the tracking of who paid for what. But they can't change the fact that dollar bills were put in the till. For someone like BitPay that's a pretty big deal (assuming their system is affected) but for a normal users of Bitcoins: not so much.
1. BitPay may not actually be vulnerable to this attack, I'm not sure. I was just using them as an example.

Don't be so quick to judge. I think is trying to inject some of his perspective and perhaps a dose of reality into the discussions. That's commendable.
I've not seen him post untruthful things (some speculation, yes, but no lies). As a "believer" myself I find this very grounding. Even though I would (naturally) get defensive in the face of them I really enjoy the "tough" questions and criticisms in general of Bitcoin.
By all means disagree with him. It's very easy (with anything) to be a nay sayer/negative nancy/parade rain maker and he does it well. However for the actual evidence, data, and points at least meet him (and any others) there and debate those things.
For example his recent bent is to downplay actual *use* of bitcoin as a currency. And that's great. It's true: Bitcoin use is relatively low. No shame in admitting that. Crypto-currencies have a long way to go. But I think it's just too easy to draw those relative comparisons and have no vision for what the future might be.
In other words: if all the nay-sayers have is "adoption is low right now" then great! We have a marketing problem. I'd take a marketing problem over a fundamental flaw any day.

I'm not advocating throwing away anything. Just that nothing should be held sacred or unchangeable. Especially so if status quo is maintained in the name of "tradition." People — all people — must have the ability to direct their own lives and that includes (requires, in fact) having control over the government that governs them.
Back to the issue at hand, though: I agree with most of your points here. Those are noble ideas. But I recognize that what I think is right or good may not be what everyone else thinks is right or good. So if society decided one day murder in some cases was okay who's to say that shouldn't be the way it is? A bad example because no free society would ever approve of murder but I think the point is made.

By that it seems you're saying there's no reason it should have hit $1,200. Or $200, $100, $10, $1, etc.
And even if that were the case (it may well be) I'm just not sure it matters at all. Whatever the market wants to buy/sell for: good for them.
As far as Bitcoin vs. others though, I think we're seeing a bit of Betamax vs. VHS. While I haven't done enough research into all the altcoins I'll say, for the sake of argument, that we're enjoying our VHS with Bitcoin. It's what the momentum is now, and for the short term at least, will be.
In the end if we swap over to another altcoin as the *primary* coin everybody uses and knows, I'm not convinced that that matters much either. *I* would *care* a lot if said replacement coin didn't have the core principles of Bitcoin but I don't think it would necessarily *matter*.
**tl;dr:** Guess I'm asking: what's your point?
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:38:15
No, I have to agree with Your bar continually raises or lowers in as much as it gives a rise out of others on this sub. Sometimes you have legitimate points and even numbers and stats, and sometimes you just don't. When you do have numbers they're few and far between, and always rehashed, it seems.
While I do feel you serve a useful function here I used to think you were of the *good* Bitcoin critics a la but now I think you lack the core conceptual basis/grounding for your arguments.
Your self-proclaimed non-interest in Bitcoin itself is fairly contrary relative to the time you spend here. Given this it's hard to place a context around your presence as, indeed, others have ruminated on before (e.g. why are you here?), I, too, wonder what you're here for. You don't seem to bring up fundamental economic principals, concepts, or objections. Your technological objections are high-level, fleeting, and at least in a case or two misunderstood. Your remaining objections at the community and ecosystem are always shifty (in that they seem to be "attack whatever's going on") rather than on some core princple(s) or arguments (that I've been able to see, anyway). So..
I deem you a troll. Naturally you shouldn't care. And you won't care. But I feel the need to point it out.
I do hope you stick around, though. Your dose of contrarianism is good for those unfamiliar with it. Heck, I count myself as a fellow contrarian in most cases. For those whose idealism of Bitcoin is dissuaded by it: that's unfortunate. For those who's stance is strengthened by it: all the better.
Good day. :)

Yeah, I'm not *quite* sure where was going with that but I think he's saying that other alt. coins don't need to be as scarce so the scarcity in Bitcoin doesn't have much point. Why get involved with a scarce coin when other not-so-scarce altcoins exist? They'll be cheaper to acquire.
For it to make a practical difference, though, altcoins have to be much better supported in the ecosystem, which they just aren't right now. Time will tell.

As a fan of his I'll go out on a limb and guess what might answer.


Perhaps not payment systems but he might say with the (at least US/UK) monetary systems monetary policy that regulates the stability of it and incentivizes re-investment in the economy through (controlled) inflation and QE. I.e. Keynesian (or similar) economics.


I'd guess for him the libertarian/Austrian-leaning schools of economics. Second part I genuinely can't answer as it seems is so disdainful of this subject he doesn't directly address it or it's tenants much (that I've seen). Except, perhaps, [here](
As for the rest of your post I get the feeling that isn't against the idea of crypo-currencies per se. He just seems to really dislike that Bitcoin (and clones) are A) decentralized in nature, b) deflationary in nature, and c) some gripes about the payment system (speed, security, practicality, etc.)

Apple has disallowed some Bitcoin apps. Apple is notoriously opaque on why this might have been. Thus we're only left with speculation on why this is so. Apple's consideration for it's own payment system (where as Bitcoin is a payment system, too) *could* be a reason to explain their banning of some Bitcoin apps. I'd think all of that is clearly implied by merely being posted to Again I'll admit none of this was stated in the post, and so because of that, yes this wouldn't meet my personal requirements for being on-topic.

You make a very good point and I think something in the Bitcoin ecosystem will need to solve this at some point.
However, scenarios like this are usually helped by replacing "cash" with "bitcoin". In the case that a vendor or manufacturer doesn't honor a warranty after money has been payed that's grounds for legal action.
Yes that's not ideal, courts are already overbooked, etc. But perhaps a private settlement court or fraud protection service or insurance scheme or organization will step into the mix. I'm thinking something like FedEx insurance — a nominal fee on top of the purchase that allows for recourse in an event. BitPay or Coinbase could implement this. Seems a natural extension. You get that additional fraud protection that people currently pay for in the form of CC or PayPal fees. But now it's a voluntary choice for vendors and/or users.

What relevance does this claimed 90% drop off after day one have? It's like you're surprised that people who already had Bitcoin would spend Bitcoin at a new place that accepts Bitcoin *purely* to "support the cause." Is this honestly a revelation to you?
In my estimation (which may be totally off or wrong) Bitcoin is still extremely early in adoption. In this day and age anything related to money (and especially for non-financial institutions e.g. end-users) needs a great deal of trust which just has to be earned. That takes time. *Of course* retail/merchant and end-user adoption/use will be low. Why would you expect, or be surprised, at anything different?

Well, sure. I'm not defending Coinbase or anything, just pointing out it's sort of "industry standard" practice for identity verification in relation to credit cards.
I can somewhat understand it, though. Instant buy requires a VISA card. Because of chargebacks they need to have the ammunition to pursue fraudsters via collection agencies and report things on credit reports.
So, really, it's just a fact of life when dealing with credit cards. I just keep looking towards the bright side: perhaps Bitcoin will take off enough that credit cards won't be so necessary and we can put the silliness of credit cards, and the ridiculous systems, bureaus, and other crap that come with them behind us.

More Bitcoins could theoretically be made than the 21 million. You just have to convince the developers and the miners to make that choice.

You say 'we' like some majority of people living now had a hand in either deciding on or putting in place the current system. It's a hand-me-down for most folks: zero choice to participate in.
Ask a majority of people whether they want the dollar in their pocket to be worth $0.98 next year or $1.00 or more you know what most folks will decide. You've spoken at length that money works the way it works now for the benefit of the *economy* on the whole. Clearly at least some folks don't want that.

This was exactly my thought. The law is written such that it seems digital currencies could *not* be included. That specific code only relates to money transmitters and money exchangers anyway.

Perhaps it's a perspective thing. If people are so put off by some internet guy's negativity (e.g. you) what do they think will happen in the real world? In that I appreciate the "beta test" you provide for those folks (and myself).
That having been said I wish I could attach to some core underlying objection(s) you have so I could understand where you're coming from. But it just seems so arbitrary. Perhaps it should be so for "interesting, infuriating, [and] funny" things. Maybe you're a closet hopeful? I dunno. :)

Bitcoins are a technology. They're not "trying to be" anything. The properties of Bitcoin and bitcoins include the potential for store of value and medium of exchange, true. But if we're talking about properties of bit coins we have to include the two generals "solution," cryptographically prevented double-spends, the notion of the blockchain, etc., etc. So in that regard I think no, bitcoins are not *only* those two things.
I definitely agree with the idea of the tradeoff you mention, though. However it seems the market has solved that problem by pegging medium of exchange type uses to fiat currency exchange rates. So it's not really an issue at this time. Time will tell if store of value will prove true. I think many would agree it won't in the long (i.e. very long) haul, though.

I don't know about *always* but whenever myself or acquaintances have had to report fraud or theft the banks have always just forgiven the difference. Literally they'll simply credit your account the fraud amount. Probably 5 times over the last 10 years that I can recall amongst 4-6 people.

Right now they may be similar (they all share a mined blockchain) and they all "work" the same when used for exchange/currency, but there's some actually important differences between them. Upcoming meta-coins are particularly interesting, too.
Perhaps more importantly if you count the ecosystem then altcoins and Bitcoins don't function the same. Exchange is much harder (for exchanges/vendors), commerce is harder (fewer merchants), technology is harder (fewer ecosystem players: wallets, apps, etc.).
So I would disagree they're identical. Technology-wise very very similar, but not close enough for them to be interchangeable (yet).


Is that your purpose here? To try and knock some sense into clueless "investors"? Commendable, but you're gonna get pounced on a lot. :)


Can't argue with that. It does get old. But I can't blame the folks who did "invest" who got a "reward" and are sharing that enthusiasm. Unfortunately some are even bound to be dicks about it. Which in turns infects people to parrot about "to the moon" and all that.
For me I don't really care about them, though. There's enough level headed thoughtful people here for it to be ignored, and regardless of the community Bitcoin is what it is and will go where it goes. The ecosystem is certainly going to take off. The market will decide if the price follows suit.

Giving someone something of value with no expectation of reciprocation is called a gift where I come from. Gifts given with sincerity are always occasions to feel grateful. Your reaction would be the 'douchey thing' here.
Maybe that's quaint and over-emotional. But really, who balks at a gift? Especially if it's sincere?

That may be true for some, but not all. A number of people are doing both: buying as investment and spending on goods.
Also some folks are playing the "long" game with the bet that they'll (eventually) never have to convert back to USD (or whatever) themselves.

Not quite. Consequences for breaking the law are a couple fold:
* 1. Punishment and retribution. This has always been a part of justice systems. I think if you were to poll many people you'd find that a lot of people would want punishment and retribution for the sake of it. It's a human need to want to feel vindicated and justice systems have provided that. Especially for victim-oriented crimes.
* 2. Deterrence of criminal. Obviously lock up dangerous people that could further do harm.
* 3. Deterrence of criminal in future. By taking away freedom or imposing fines or whatever it teaches a lesson to that person and they'll not want to commit the crime again.
* 4. Deterrence of potential other criminals. E.g. the punishment should be high-profile enough to discourage potential future crime. Make an example out of them.
* 5. Rehabilitation. Have opportunities for self improvement. This is partly why libraries, computers, games, and exercise equipment are in prisons.
Obviously various crimes have different mixtures of the above items and indeed the mixture has changed over history.
To be clear I'm not advocating retribution but it has been and continues to be a *wanted* and *desired* aspect of the system. I think that in the future we'll have less of it (as people become more enlightened), but it's a lot of human nature to change over night.

Perhaps you haven't had a new physical credit or debit card lately. Multiple people, myself included, using different banks and credit card companies have received cards that do not have the embossed/raised lettering and numbering they used to. This makes the impression swipe carbon copy machines sort of uesless.

Where would you suggest people go to speculate on why Apple has been less than welcoming of Bitcoin apps on their platforms? Or is that just a taboo subject here?
On the other hand this article was given no context as posted, and by itself I could see how it's off-topic. Still, it's not a stretch to understand the intent behind it.

This would be terrible. It implies people with more more bitcoins are more trustworthy somehow. I do like the signature idea. Maybe participate in an m-of-n transaction.

As I understand it if the mining power decided it was so then the blockchain would simply fork. I agree users won't debase their currency — that was part of my point above. Also not to mention it just goes against the spirit of Bitcoin — it's just overall highly unlikely. *But* it is *possible*.
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:11:35
Certainly you misspoke. Bitcoin is all about lack of centralized control and Satoshi is/are not "in control" of any money "supply." If he owns 1/12 of the current amount of Bitcoins that makes him merely wealthy.
Are you saying someone *that wealthy* is a bad thing somehow? And somehow it's damning that they're (an) alleged "shadowdy anarchist(s)?" Wealthy people aren't above the law (though they can bend the rules of course). Can you articulate this gigantic risk you mention?

Are you kidding? First of all you have to take into context the whole situation and all the problems with delivery and support. And then on top of that you have this message where Jordan is calling names (disgruntled, impatient), defensively posturing (his recounting of the "facts") and while he admits personal blame it's not sincere, there's no apology and ends with, essentially, downplaying the incident.
This was an absolutely horrible reply.

I'm not sure if it's mentioned in there but Overstock uses Coinbase merchant services and TigerDirect uses Bitpay. Bitpay's numbers wouldn't overlap with Overstock's announcements.
But I've lost your point in all of that. I thought we started with: Bitpay's numbers aren't as good as during the holiday shopping season. Aside from a lack of detailed (or possibly accurate) numbers being available, what are you drawing from this?

Not really. Everyone denominates products &amp; services in a fiat currency with a "live" conversion done for the BTC amount. Nothing wrong with that.

It seems to me that, fundamentally, these economic schools of thought center around more ideological premises than mathematical. For example your oft-said quote (paraphrasing) "the entire point of an economy is to connect those who have capital with those who need capital." That seems largely ideological and, well, of opinion.
I do want to understand what you're saying - are there studies or analyses that support "Austrian economic school is wrong as a matter of math"? Any further explanation? Anything? Really, I'd like to know more! Seems critically related to Bitcoin if so. I'd imagine many folks would want (or need) to know such things!

I also forgot to say that this is worked around by simply *not relying* on TXIDs to track payment. You relay on the actual bitcoin spent (looking at address inputs and outputs). This is the change that Bitstamp put in place.

I'll yield on the start-up situation but only because I think we're talking about separate things. Admittedly I was focusing on high-tech startups and indeed venture/angel capital is far more common there. Debt financing is what a start-up *wants* (so as to avoid giving board positions and voting stock) but they just can't get it. And for good reason: banks aren't going to give 10M+ loan to just any start-up.
I'm quite interested in what you say that debt capitalization is cheaper the self capitalization. Could you expound on that?

I think you missed his point. I think he's pointing out the arbitrariness of the scarcity. Bitcoin doesn't *have* to be scarce. It is purposely so despite there being no technical or other requirement. I.e. it was chosen to be so. Whereas something like gold is naturally scarce.
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:51:00
I mean: any reason not to bundle them?
Or said another way: are they truly perfectly not related in any technical way what-so-ever and can exist entirely independently? Let's assuming they had they both features as BIPs with the same activation dates and everything else — would that change anything?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:42:59


I don't see it being incompatible with any particular economic system — including those you listed, save for perhaps totalitarianism, or maybe those systems that exist post-scarcity.


It doesn't sound like you're familiar with how the internet, as in, packet-switched networking, came about. Specifically why it was designed and the human value decisions that went into its systems design.


As you said its human designers may have tried to instill those values in some of the arbitrary rules of the protocol level, and also as you say it's celebrated by those who share those values; but Bitcoin itself — the code running on the nodes, clients, and the miners — has no inherent political ideology.
To conflate the human aspect and its political connections with the thing itself is misguided, I feel. In fact its downright weird to anthropomorphize electrons moving in a specific pattern to have 'political ideology'. A vacuum cleaner has no opinions about cleanliness. It's ostensibly a tool used for humans to execute their ideologies about cleanliness (as well as a brush motor and some plastic tubing, electronics, etc.).
Now, at the same time, it's a very easy thing to conflate. We all kinda assume the Bitcoin community, its various opinions, movements, designers goals, etc. is bundled in the name. Therefore it's common to just say Bitcoin *has* all of those attributes and traits, despite code lacking any ability to hold such positions.
Further, the very common and ostensible ways in which people use Bitcoin still doesn't make Bitcoin itself (again, the running code) have those attributes, even if those arbitrary design decisions were made. For example Bitcoin has no concept of *people* — and instead is entirely abstracted around private keys. It's merely *convention* that we say that private keys belong to people. What percentage of people own Bitcoin on private keys the secrets for which they solely control? Given the onboarding numbers of Coinbase I'm going to say vanishingly small. Not that that has anything to do with success or value that we give Bitcoin, merely that Bitcoin itself, on a protocol &amp; code level, shouldn't be conflated the values and ideologies involved.
This is the way in which I say Bitcoin has no inherent political values, and that it is welcome to all to participate in. The Bitcoin community by and large and the original designers, etc? They absolutely have some of those values. But it literally doesn't matter who participates. Hell, post-scarcity and totalitarians are *also* welcome to participate because, frankly, nobody can stop them. The code doesn't care. The best it can do is execute how its been written — which is entirely apolitical in its operation. Unless you consider executing computer code political (which I'd find very odd, unless we're talking about a sophisticated enough AI to have properties of personhood).
