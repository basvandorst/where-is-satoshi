Right. If asked how a car works, you might describe some of the things a car can do, and what actions you take to make those things happen. Diving deeper into the drivetrain you could describe an engine, transmission, and differential. Going progressively more in depth might eventually get you to the composition of a clutch plate, which isn't at all relevant to someone who just wants to know "how a car works."

Workers are getting paid fairly, though. You and your employer agree on a wage/salary that you both think you're worth, and then they pay you that. If you think you're worth more than they're willing to pay, go do something else. That's the very definition of fair!

Honestly, it's not that bad. I bank with BoA and Chase, and I've never had an issue with either. No stupid fees, no holds, no problems. Chase will flip out if you use funds from their account to buy/sell crypto, but otherwise I have no complaints.

That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm saying that traditional banking is easier in most respects, but it loses in this one. Is one fringe case really that important that it supercedes all the others?

The first two are equally painless. Bitcoin does have the advantage for small foreign transactions, but how often are you really doing that? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:36:58
Depends who you ask and what you want to do with your coins. I don't have anything stored on exchanges anymore, but I did when I was first getting into crypto. While there have been examples of exchanges getting hacked and people losing lots of money, I thought that was probably lots less likely than me screwing something up before I fully knew what was going on. Personally, I'd leave my money with Coinbase for now while I read up on wallets and security and then move them over to something simple like Electrum. If you decide to continue investing and accrue a decent sum of coins, it would probably be worth investing in something even more secure like a Trezor or Ledger (once you're comfortable with them, of course).
All the above assumes you just want to have bitcoin as an investment. If you actually want to spend them, you'll need to keep at least some in a wallet, either on your computer or phone. I personally keep a very small amount on my phone just in case I want to make a quick online purchase or send/receive from a friend and store the rest in a Trezor.

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:58
Relax. You don't have to like Bitcoin or think it's a good idea, but you're on a sub where almost everyone does, and if you quit with the hostility you might actually give people the chance to explain themselves. And while I am one of those 18-21s investing chump change, many people here aren't.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:51:52
No. When you purchase coins on Coinbase, they still have them in their own wallets, they just mark down that however much you bought is now "yours" in much the same way that money in your checking account is in a large pool with everyone else's at your bank. You'll need to tell Coinbase to send "your" coins to an address you have control over to truly own them. Whether or not you should actually do this is another question entirely.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:45:57
If the stress ever gets to be too much, I would gladly take some off your hands. For your sake only, of course.

Then what's the point? Is it the novelty? Clearly it's not the cost, as you lose on all sides of that transaction. Maybe I'm just too selfish to see the benefit.

I opened a chase account and a local bank account a month or so ago, both online, with no ID or verification other than an SSN and address. Both gave me a couple hundred dollars for doing so, and each was less than a ten minute process. It can't get much more painless

It's not though. What good does that adoption do for you or anyone else? 
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:15:16
Is it? Unless you're making a ton of international payments to small creators you trust or you're getting a steep discount for your trouble, I really don't see the benefit, but I'd love to hear the argument
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:22:03
Your $10 donation does exactly $10 of good. That's a positive thing no matter how much gets donated in total. Your bitcoin payment isn't a comparable inherent good.

He doesn't control what you do, though. You're going to do what you want regardless. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 18:26:18
Because I can trade it for something I want? Surely you must be joking.
I can work for dollars to buy food and gas and whatever. Or I can work for dollars, pay a fee to turn into bitcoin, pay a fee to send, and then they pay a fee to turn it back into dollars (for most, not all, purchases). One seems much more financially wise, at least for now. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 19:10:02
I want to start by saying I have bitcoin, I think it will have a definite use in the distant future, and I've done well holding it in the medium-term. I don't want any of this to come across as a bashing of Bitcoin or its potential, I just don't see the financial benefit in using it at this point.
I assume you are one of the vast majority of people in the US not paid for the bulk of your work in Bitcoin. If you are, you're one of the edge cases none of the following applies to. Also, when buying goods at almost any merchant, there is one price for cash, credit, and debit. I know that this price encapsulates interchange fees and the like, but I'm going to call this total the price, and any sale that has reduced or no associated interchange fees will be considered a discount.
When you get paid in USD, you can immediately make almost any purchase you want on a Citi DoubleCash card and get a 2% discount with only a few seconds wait time at no cost over the "price."
Or, you can trade it for BTC. This costs little to nothing except your time spent doing it. Then it needs to be sent to a vendor (always for a fee, sometimes a very large fee if times are to be short), the vendor saves on the CC fee, but has the other end of the exchange fee (1.5% net benefit or so). So whatever the discounted price is you pay, it needs to be discounted enough to cover your miner fee, your invested time, and the cash back you would've originally gotten (call it 2.5%), but the merchant sees a much smaller benefit. It's a net-loss for the pair of you. No matter the discount the merchant sets, you can't both win or even both break even.
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:30:57
But you personally can't do that on any meaningful scale. It's like saying I want to buy Apple products so their stock I hold goes up. Yes, I guess it would, but not nearly enough to make it financially worth it.

He mentioned there are solid coins (bitcoin), useless coins that may eventually turn into something good (eos), joke coins (dogecoin), and straight up scams (bitcoinnect). Providing any more than one example of each would really bog down a 20 minute segment, I think. The point wasn't to have a detailed analysis ranking the top 100 coins, it was to give a simple introduction to the space as a whole and urge people to use caution.
@_date: 2019-09-30 14:49:50

Because they have been proven to affect objects in different ways. Magnetism requires motion while electric forces do not.

Maybe it does for you, but not for the people that just want to play around with it. Your use case isn't the only one. And just because someone uses Coinbase early on doesn't mean they can't use Bitcoin differently as they get more experienced. Sell or spend the Coinbase coins, generate a new wallet, and be done with it.
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:53:40
Like I said before, they are absolutely interconnected. All I said was that magnetic and electric fields are different. Which they demonstrably are.
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:14:49
But my spending with crypto or not has no noticeable impact on the price (and thus the benefit to me). That 2% fee is a very real cost to me. Why would I want to take on a 2% cost for no benefit? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:02:16
Honestly, that couldn't matter to me any less. Let the original goals be the past, and let's do the best we can with what we have. Satoshi isn't in charge.
@_date: 2018-04-11 17:35:22
Yeah, I get to delay paying for a month with no fee, 1% cash back, and the backing of a giant financial institution vs. paying now with a 2% fee. If people want to make that choice, I respect it, and it's a noble thing to do to support a technology you believe in, but it's clearly the wrong choice if only the economics matter to you.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:06:34
Are you serious? Yes they do. The high school physics level difference is moving charges vs all charges. Are you looking for more depth than that?

If you think so, go for it. But most people I know, myself included, would never want to take on that much risk. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:11:56
I've said this before and I will again. As a rational human, I don't want to be doing what everyone else is. If everyone is using it as a currency and the price increases, I want to be holding. If everyone is holding and the price is stagnating/falling, I want to spend/sell. There's a reason people will call on everyone else to spend their coins without doing so themself; it's just the smart thing to do. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:16:35
It's also debt that no sane country would want to collect. An American economic collapse isn't good for anyone.

The Feynman video above explains it better than I can, but it's not that people don't know how magnets work, it's that the average person doesn't even come close to having the background knowledge necessary to understand the explanation. With other, simpler topics, there are analogies that can be used and parallels to other things you already know, but with magnetism there isn't that option.
I don't know what you have in-depth knowledge of, but I'm sure there are things you know that you could not explain to me to my satisfaction in any reasonable amount of time. For me, that topic is structural engineering. Just because I can't explain to you simply how to determine the stress distribution in a beam due to loading away from the shear center doesn't mean that no one understands it. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 00:45:04
Just to get a baseline, are you comfortable with electric and magnetic fields and how the two phenomena are interconnected?
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:19:15

I get it, you're familiar with everything there is to know about crypto and you value privacy over all else, so don't use Coinbase. But not everyone has the same knowledge or priorities as you. If my dad wanted to mess around with Bitcoin, for example, I'd still send him to Coinbase, because it's still the least intimidating mainstream solution out there. Just because you don't like it or want to use it, doesn't mean that no one should.
