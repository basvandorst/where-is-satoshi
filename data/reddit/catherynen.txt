Cool! Nice job Snapcard!

We have a unique architecture (we don't use bitcoind/core) and that allows us to listen to a large percentage of the network and know the propagation characteristics of txs.

Transaction status for litecoin and bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:19:14
Thought I'd post the 13 steps to production if you're running  bitcoind yourself:
1. Install bitcoind, 40hr to download chain (if you're lucky)
2. Pick a library for RPC API
3. Learn different requests
4. Write your app code
5. Set-up bitcoind server in production
6. Ensure connection to “good” peers
7. Wait another 40hr
8. Disable public RPC calls
9. Secure server
10. Set-up backups (or else you’ll have to wait 40hr again)
11. Set-up automatic restart for crashes 
12. Add another server for redundancy
13. Want to run in multi-datacenter? Start again at Step 1 and repeat

The difference is we receive the data: we don't need to ask the network for it. There's only so many times you can ask for info before the network gets annoyed at you.

Here's how CoinSafe uses BlockCypher's APIs to convert btc into cash in &lt;15s at ATMs

Does it occur to anyone that this is pain?

Our startup, BlockCypher, was put on rocket fuel supplied by the Boost team and the Drapers. They advocate for you, help you, and get you to the next level: invaluable to a fledgling startup.

This is truly needed in Bitcoin. The volatility is a big issue and I'm glad to see Hedgy addressing this.

Hi anaccountjustforyou. What don't you like? I'd like to hear. Documentation is also on Github  If something is not clear, let us know. Thank-you!

If you want a really sweet iOS wallet, you should try Pheeva wallet. They have managed to find a way around Apple's ban. 
I hope mobile web wallets take full advantage of this opportunity...

Pheeva wallet, for their user experience. I appreciate how hard Lamar - the main dev behind it - works on his wallets. Pheeva also uses BlockCypher on the backend to increase transaction reliability.

Micropayments in online games is another great use case. Mego, for example.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:13:34
The API is used for doing microtransactions ON the block chain, not off the chain like most do. You can do them in near real-time with extremely low fees (which we cover up to a certain number so that the receiver gets exactly the amount that was sent).

Rolling in laughter. My poor co-founder! Merci Madame!! FollowTheCoin, CareerDean: you rock.

We don't 'decrease the confirmation time'. We give a confidence factor on whether the transaction will be confirmed. We know because we connect to a huge number of nodes in the network, receive all sorts of info (w/out having to scan), and can therefore tell within 10s whether the transaction will likely make it into a block. 
If an attacker were trying to perpetrate a double-spend attack they'd need to broadcast two transactions: transaction A sending bitcoin to your address and transaction B sending the exact same unspent outputs to an address they control. In order to succeed, a miner needs to include transaction B in a block before transaction A makes it into a block. Since miners with transaction A in their memory pool will refuse transaction B and miners with transaction B in their memory pool will refuse transaction A, we can use the memory pool to predict which transactions will eventually make it into a block. If we sample a very large number of bitcoin nodes and find transaction A in their memory pool (and not transaction B), then we can predict the odds that A will make it into a block despite our malicious attacker. See this paper from the IEEE for the background:

In a wallet, you send/receive a certain amount of bitcoin. For this transaction to happen successfully, the network needs to: verify that there are funds "available" (inputs&gt;=outputs),  that correct change is given, and the correct transaction fees have been applied. 
This API allows a developer to make all this happen in 3 simple steps:
1. With only an input address, output address, and the value transferred, we build the full unsigned transaction and the data to sign it.
2. You sign the transaction data (we do not store any private keys) and send us the signature.
3. We complete the transaction, broadcast it over the peer-to-peer network, and send it back to you.
