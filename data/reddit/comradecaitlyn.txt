People arent as naive when they lose their homes, loans, mortgages. Hype wont bring it back. In fact, if they do come back, theyll likely commit the same thing again. In turn, your back to your delusional hype cycle with the same result. The market is too volatile and unregulated for anyone to want to invest their resources in crypto. Unless big banks come into play and secure exchanges, crypto is a dead dream. Which defeats the entire purpose of crypto in the first place.

Crypto had its chance last year and blew it. Everyone knows it. The people who are in it are people who've lost money and are hopeful in making some back or are in some gamblers fallacy. Blockchain tech is extremely useful and will be adopted, as evident, but crypto wont be. People learned their lesson, got exploited by whales and vanished. You wont ever get those people back into the ecosystem without proper exchanges and severe regulation. Fiat will exist forever till until we as a human species start running out of resources etc.

Adoption will never happen without reliable exchanges. No average person in their right mind would ever use crypto if they cant even trust an exchange to withhold their funds. Crypto will forever be used just like it has been for the past decade: random online transactions and fast money making through exploitation of the common.
