Well, I always wondered (but never got a clear answer) whether you could open a channel with zero balance, buy BTC for fiat on LN, say $20.05 (topping up your channel balance) and then use it to buy $20 worth of weed, without having to lock any large amount.  
If you can - then LN would be highly functional (but would pose a threat to miners' revenue in the longer run). If you can't do it - then LN is overhyped and will be inferior to any fast, low tx fee altcoin (in terms of functionality).

Are you saying that currently the majority of Bitcoin users run full nodes??  
If not, is Bitcoin already PayPal?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:02:31
So there are only few thousands full nodes Vs few millions estimated btc users, and Bitcoin is still not PayPal but only "on the way"?  
And do you (Core devs) have any solid plan to get majority of users to run a full nodes (you know, other than crippling adoption and number of users)?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:51:20


You could be right here, I don't know, but you have to look at it from regulators' perspective. Yes, you can equate LN hubs to mining nodes (in terms to "payment processing" and collecting fees), but it's naïve to think that regulators will keep ignoring it forever. I don't see lawmakers allowing mainstream BTC/LN usage, with hubs processing $millions/day worth txs and just let them be, while literally every other fiat processing business is subject to strict KYC/AML policies.  


The answer to this question was: large number of on-chain txs with small fees will (hopefully) provide sufficient revenue.  
With LN, you have small number of on-chain txs with small fees.  
See the problem?

"Those who would give up essential Scaling and Adoption to purchase a little more temporary Decentralisation, deserve neither."  
Works both ways
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:37:06


Do 2 users exchanging with eachother count?
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:19:02


Are you of impression that only banks are subject to KYC/AML? LN hubs are new concept and no one knows how they'll be treated by regulators.  


Great. Now you don't have full blocks = low fees. But what's the incentive for miners (after block reward is not enough) to carry on?
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:54:42
looks legit
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:09:50


*Disclaimer: c-lightning is not production ready. TorGuard will cover loss of funds when sending us LN payments. Testnet is so boring.*

@_date: 2014-08-02 11:44:56
Why not? The idea seems a good way to promote BTC, it would be the biggest BTC crowd-funding project so far, it would surely get a lot of media attention. Doge did it first? So what? Unless people think BTC already got so far and grown that big that doesn't really need this form of attention.
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:18:04

Lies! Litecoiners don't tip! everybody knows that
@_date: 2014-08-02 14:22:00
OK, just realised there's something strange about this campaign. They claim to be raising money among the BTC community to help promote BTC. But if some big sponsor (non-BTC related) shows up and throws $50k - they'd have their logo on the hood. So, in theory, bitcoiners can raise say $40k and still end up sponsoring ie. McDonalds car (with the bitcoin logo only on the quarter panel). WTF?
They didn't think it through.

Shitposting on twitter to create an impression of community support must have been pretty time consuming.
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:08:41


Let me guess, this somehow doesn't apply to Blockstream devs who got ~$75m of sweet JV money with zero obligations (according to M Corallo).
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:16:41


BS is not quite your average start-up, isn't it? If what Matt Corallo said is true (zero pressure from investors on you generating revenue + you're free to work on whatever you want), then it's not far off from winning a lottery (I doubt whether he was right though), the question is - how big is the winning. You could just slowly convert JV funds into your private wealth via paying yourselves salaries (your biggest cost).  


Why are you referring to a 'typical' start-up? Does BS pay less than industry average? Also, is there any chance you'll be publishing your statutory financial statements on your website for transparency?

Greece is in the Eurozone (they use Euros), India has a healthy inflation rate, Zimbabwe switched to US dollars around 2009.  
Bitcoin is indeed useful when hyperinflation strikes in, but it's definitely not 'the only way out'. Most people would just move to more stable foreign currencies.

You can buy with your card at Cex.io. Circle may be better, but it's for US only.  
Note that if you're using the card for the first time it will take some time for the order to be processed.

That's not a bad idea from the advertisement point of view.  
The problem is no one can (or is willing to) sponsor such campaigns on a regular basis. If you need to spend $thousands or $mils every month just to keep the 'bad boy' image alive, then it doesn't make much sense.  
So the real question is whether one-time campaign to break the current image/stereotype is worth the effort...

Bitsquare is irrelevant. 24h volume (total) is less than 2 btc. There are crypto trading teenagers turning around more money daily than bitsquare.
