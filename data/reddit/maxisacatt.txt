Prohashing sucks too. It was working fine for a few hours and now says "No valid shares yet..."  After a few minutes the L3+ then switches back to nicehash. I'm not sure what's going on here. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:07:34
That is some true cuck level thinking

Well, there is a dealership by my house that has them for sale, so if I ever get the 200k I can go grab one. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:26:22
35k aint shit in the US. 35k is working poor. You can hardly cover bills with that. Hell my ASIC miners will make more than that in a year.

Divorce? I'm never getting married bro
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:17:39
I've never left the US....

You just need the money for an L3+ and a PSU and point them to nicehash NOT prohashing. I bought mine with a CC and every two weeks I transfer the funds from my wallet to coinbase and cash them out and pay down the CC. Once they are paid off (1 more month) I'll buy 2 D3s and repeat. My goal is to get 8 D3s and 2 L3+. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:55:20
That is a good point. My friend has 3 D3s on the way, so I'll guage how much he makes before I buy a bunch. The A5 may be a better choice then. I'm loving the L3+ so far. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 21:25:08
I keep checking nicehash a few times an hour. I know I make 100 a day in BTC, but I just keeping checking to see how much I've made. I don't know how to stop.
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:48:33
I'm pointing it to stratum+tcp://scrypt.usa.nicehash.com:3333
user ID is your wallet address. I use a nice hash wallet for one L3+ and another wallet for the other L3+  I added .L3plus101 at the end of the wallet address so nicehash names the device in the dashboard. 
Password I left at 123.
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:22:24
Man, I could buy one BTC right now and I'm not in that 99.99% percent club you're talking about. Get a damn job. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:52:47
You're a fucking asshole. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:10:18
I just went back to prohashing. Nicehash has gone to shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:53:44
33 and I'm in a serious relationship. Never getting married, never having kids. I don't buy into the thoughts of "buying her something nice" or "happy wife happy life". 
She should be happy that I'm with her, not happy because I buy her shit. That's cuck land. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 20:44:04
good luck with your divorce
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:21:48
36??? I'm pointing them to nicehash's Scrypt algorithm. be sure to add the Xnsub info. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:28:34
I'd set up a mining farm. Earn the 50k back plus extra.
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:41:54
[WTF]( I need talk to the rest of the 1 percent then because I sure as hell aint in lambo land.
@_date: 2017-08-14 15:24:39
Switch to nicehash man.
This is one [L3+](
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:27:23
that makes way more sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 03:59:25
You should have returned the defective one. It sounds like it may be bricked due to the firmware pushes, and since you caused that you can't return it now. 
You may want to check the ribbions near the 6 pin connectors. If those got pinched they could cause the XXXXXXXX you are seeing. Also try using a PSU from one of the working devices and see if that clears the issue. 
I don't have a S3+, but I do have a few L3+ and the only time I saw XXXXXXXX was from a pinched ribbon. Powered it off and fixed the ribbion and everything went back to normal. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:55:50
My 2 L3+ rigs are plulling 100-120 a day. I'm itching to scale up. My buddy has an empty condo and house that we are going to turn into farms.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:57:33
You leave 200-300 on coinbase. You get a shift debit card which is linked to your coinbase account. You use shift debit card to buy MTG cards from gamestop.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:42:24
The dude wants to sell BTC using paypal. That means he would have to give someone 230 worth of BTC and then someone would need to give him $230 through paypal. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:40:19
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:07:23
It takes a couple of days for it show up does it not? Next time OP should buy with their debit card. It is instant. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:22:11
Going forward buy from allthingsdecentral. They replied to my questions regarding and outstanding order and they are going to cancel and refund me. No issues with those guys so far. Becareful who you buy from. It's the wild wild west. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:46:28
you'll sell before you ever get to the moon
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:28:04
Whoever is buying the BTC should be nice enough to send OP the 230 as a gift through paypal. I'd do it for OP but I might get burned in a way I don't predict. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:20:12
of course it is
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:01:03
I just got a shift card yesterday and it dosen't have a chip. Can you cover up the numbers and post a pic?
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:32:35
best place to purchase is coinbase. Best place to store is coinbase. Always store on an exchange!
@_date: 2017-09-05 22:45:47
Visa kinda already supports it. My Shift card has a Visa logo.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:45:46
I bought at 1800. I bought at 2700. I bought at 3000. I bought at 4000. I bought at 4400. I bought at 4600. I bought at 4900. I will always be buying. 4400, 5000, hell 10000 is nothing. This is going to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:12:53
They are not selling OIUs. I bought 1k worth of BTC and moved it off coinbase and into a hard wallet this morning.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:38:09
Why did you fall for this? The guy could just buy a gift card with his bitcoin from a resell site.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:02:29
I'll sell you an L3+ with a power supply for 1 BTC shipped in the US. Full tracking with signature.

I hid a Sony Walkman from 1983 inside of a tree in the woods. It has a tape inside it that when played backward gives a 12 word riddle. This is not my true recovery key. My true key is the opposite of every word on the tape. Even with that infomation, you still need a cypher. The cyper is being kept by 3 homeless men behind a shell station on Martin Luther King Blvd. It's not an easy journey to the shell station. The path is filled with villians and terrors. A place where the hearts of the BTC wanting man dare not go.
I think my BTC is good to go.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:38:34
Still in the dip so it's still a good time to buy. We're going back up to 5k
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:57:18
how is coinbase confusing? Type in 20 dollars and buy. End of story.
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:47:02
Retards everywhere man. This is what happens without natural selection. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:48:43
Don't let someone send you 230 first through paypal. They will file a claim as soon as you send the BTC. Yeah it's risky, but you'd have to send first. I'd do it, but I could get burned in a way I'm just not thinking of. Whoever you sell to, should send you the 230 as a gift. If they don't, then they are going fuck you over. 
Maybe check with friends and see if they want to buy some BTC?
With coinbase you'd need to link a bank account and upload a copy of your ID. Once you do that you can cash out to your PayPal account. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:56:05
I'm in the US. I don't plan to use it, but if PayPal is down on coinbase I could see myself using the card.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:59:12
I ordered a Ledger Blue yesterday but it won't ship until september.
