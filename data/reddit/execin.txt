They "destroyed" their private key and they don't give the address their pool sends BTC on.  
What I am saying is that there is no proof. You can't just destroy a private key but only pretend that you haven't hide a backup of it for later use.  
If they want to play the cool guys who don't care about nothing and burn money they should do it publicly. They should set their payout address to something impossible to find it's private key and release that address to the public.

Cyprus runs on 240V. The minimum service/fuse you can legally have is 40 A. You can however request a bigger service (I have 60 A) if you can prove that you can exceed the current of 40 A.

Electricity is not a problem in my case. I can find a friend that stays in a dorm (where they pay a constant fee for all the appliances) and host my miner there.  
I thought of ordering a Butterfly Labs miner but I can't take the risk of getting my miner after 6 months where the difficulty would be much higher, the total hash rate would be also much higher and the BTC price uncertain. What I am trying to say is that if I find the money for such a miner I have to be sure that I can live without those money spend on my order until the miner pays it back.

I don't know about you but the first one doesn't bug me at all. Computer storage become super-cheap those days. If you still feel bugged by the space the blockchain occupies you can use a lightweight client.  
  
The second one bugs me the most. Even if I do not fall for the dev's attempt to include the extra, unwanted software in the installation, many other users have 5 toolbars on their browser and 3 other programs that pop-up every 5 minutes to offer the user to clean-up their pathetic, filthy computer, fix their super-damaged registry and get rid of 10 000 problems like "MS Paint holds the path of the recent files you opened with it!

You can't just say you have 10 BTC (when other people owe you because you gave them a loan).

In Cyprus it is almost impossible to buy BTC. Only face to face transactions can occur but nobody is selling BTC for cash here

If you download something infected via p2p you don't really know who the hacker is. The cryptolocker doesn't check the blockchain, this is why it needs verification. Every function of the cryptolocker is done offline.

Dude, I've tried everything.  
OKPAY is not the way

Please rest assured, your account has been successfully created and you can access it anytime except the financial operations. We will be glad to fully suit your needs as soon as licensing process will be completed. Thank you for your patience and understanding,

SEPA is not permitted (unless you are sending to a student and you have proofs or your business has to pay for something)  
There is no person in [localbitcoins]( or  selling BTC **locally** in Cyprus.  
I know about how BTC is volatile. I am an experienced user (even tho I mostly had 1.14 BTC in my Bitcoin history) My plan is to make half of my EUR in BTC.  
I don't consider this as an investment. I don't want to get BTC to watch it's price in USD grow. I just want to keep the banks out of my money and been able to spend my money on whatever I want (in or out of the country)  
  
Edit: forgot typing "to spend"

Haha, not everyone knows what Bitcoin is. Even those that know, can't just buy them because no one is selling.  
Selling goods/services seem to be the way to go.

I think she spends too much. She could also make the food orders earlier to get her food the time she wants it.  
Why doesn't she just buy a bag of coffee so that she can make her coffee by herself? Its not that hard. Boil water, mix with coffee, add sugar/milk/whatever and drink.

Buying Bitcoins is like:  
1. Buying a pineapple from the groceries store  
2. Swapping USD for EUR at your bank  
You don't have to be above 18 to be legal

You can even push a transaction to the blockchain without getting your [Offline PC] to be online. You just need that magical string to be pushed by any online computer.  
Your password was entered only on the [Offline PC] and the transaction was "submited" by any other online computer. Your wallet and your password will never be exposed on the internet.

Try and find the blockchain.info app over the AppStore. If you can't find it, I can compile/sign the app specifically for your device. If you don't trust me, you can compile the app yourself and let me only to do the signing.

I was trying to buy some BTC the past week but I couldn't deposit my money to BitStamp (the bank wouldn't let me)  
I gave some cash to a friend of mine that was flying to the UK to make me the deposit from a UK bank.

I hope the final design has labeled buttons. Also the Grant button should be smaller and its surface should lean inwards and the Deny button should be bigger. Just like most car keys (with wireless central-locking capabilities) today.

Hand drawn BTC would seem cool.  
However, I think that NMC are a form of internet cancer.

Don't take my comment in an offensive way but just by being a domain name dealer is not enough to make a secure website.  
Forget the trading service. The next closer service to do is a completely trust-based, community-driven marketplace (like [ where you don't have to manage the transactions.

This is not the way to go. The daemon should not be web-browser bound.

I am an iOS developer so I don't really care if Apple bans an open-source app.  
For those who cant install the blockchain.info app can still sent BTC using the blockchain.info website.

Just use a VM with a reputable lightweight Linux distro and use it EXCLUSIVELY for BTC transactions.  
[rommelvr]( is right. You shouldn't keep your money in MtGox. Sent them to your own controlled environment (your Linux virtual machine).  
  
The VM won't have an affect to your performance in games/mining since you will only access it when you want to sent BTC and maybe receive (if you don't remember the address)

Its not that simple.  
SEPA or wire transfers in general are forbidden outside the country unless the receiver is a student or someone who must be payed from your company.  
Buying BTC for cash could work only if someone was selling.

Buy BTC? You can easily gather 0.01 BTC without buying it with fiat.  
For example offer your English grammar correcting skills for 0.03 BTC and get 3 domains instead (for each person you serve!)

That could work.  
To fund the cashU deposit you need to get a cashU prepaid card. There are some automated terminals that accept cash and return all kinds of redeemable stuff on several mini-markets. I am trying tomorrow to see if they give cashU codes.
