Each marketplace (assisted by its storefront) in Swarm City acts like its own individual app. I'd like to be able to give you a clearer picture, but really the first step would be for you to read about Swarm City in the articles I posted above. At least we moved forward from Swarm City being narrowly focused though. :)

I'm going to get you your goddamn chocolate milk :)

I am. The approach has always been an entire ecosystem. The first of the 5 posts I shared gives the overview.

No no. Rideshare is just one small use case. Swarm City allows anyone to easily create and manage whatever type of marketplace they want, from buy/sell like Amazon, to service, and share. The marketplaces are powered by unique smart contracts. Users of these marketplaces can find each other, and post or respond to offers there. 
Successful deals prompt the smart contract to create blockchain reputation for each party. Since each marketplace is unique, the reputation it produces is contextually unique. Marketplace owners charge a small, fixed fee for every transaction that goes through it, and in return they provide things like conflict resolution for users of their marketplace. 
Not only that, users can form communities in Swarm City. For example, communities of rideshare drovers can easily form what amounts to a mini DAO with an automatic governance structure chosen by the community creator. Each time a community member completes a deal, a small percentage of their earnings goes into the community's smart contract to be used on things like marketing or insurance. That way community members can benefit from economies of sale. This is an entire ecosystem with properly aligned incentives.
These articles provide a pretty good overview of what's going on:

Swarm City is an ecosystem, so yes payments are made in SWT. But our app contains a decentralized exchange, so any ETH token will do. And with things like the "Shifty" button, any crytpo is possible.
You can always pay with cash, but then you forgo reputation, since that only occurs when transactions occur through the marketplace's smart contracts.
"I do not want to pay even a penny to the app or chain as a user the seller would support the app and chain via a monthly subscription fee." If a seller pays a fee, it just gets passed down to the user by way of a more expensive product or service. In Swarm City, users will pay small fixed fees to the marketplace owners, but in return you get conflict resolution. And if one marketplace gets too expensive, another marketplaces will pop up that undercuts them.
"If I was a seller I would like to be able to have multiple accounts as well, to be able to brand myself or my products separately." In Swarm City you can create as many identities as you want. But I would bet most people would have a couple max, so they can benefit from the permanent reputation each one earns.

Haha! SC is not complicated. You'll see. Just choose your favorite marketplace (grocery delivery for example) and someone will get your stuff. You'll both get reputation for completing the deal, and the more reputation you have, the more likely people will do business with you in the future.

We will have decentralized rideshare with built in Blockchain reputation in the near term, yes.

The reputation you're describing is subjective though. That can gamed. Objective rep is our direction.

We're making an adoption ready platform with one requirement to use a completely decentralized platform with fraud proof rep. There's one requirement. The user has to be able to get a crypto. Just one.
Who would the sellers pay the subscription fee to? If there's a central authority collecting fees, it can be shut down. SC can not.

"Seems overly complicated instead of some sort of distributed ledger used to determine trust with a built in ability to point to a specific webpage for more information about a product or service." Part of this happens in the "Storefront" of each marketplace (see article above).
But Craigslist is a good comparison. Users request and fulfill requests is designated categories. But if the platform is to be completely decentralized (like Swarm City will be), no one central authority should have the power to create those categories like Craigslist does. That's why Users may (but don't have to) create their own marketplaces for buyers/sellers, service seekers/providers to transact in.
Swarm City (the platform and people building it) cannot prohibit marketplaces from forming, communities from forming, or transactions from occurring. For that reason we must give users the power to create each of these on their own. And the smart contracts align incentives properly so good actors/actions are rewarded.

Ok. That way there is no reputation.

We have plenty of money to execute Swarm City. The hack didn't slow us down at all.  If you check our Github, or  in Slack you'll see progress made almost 24 hours per day.

The difficulty is swarm.city the website is the entrance to the app. So it doesn't make sense to put all the "what is" stuff directly there. However we're building out thisis.swarm.city to address the lack of info issue of the site. While there are many different ways to use Swarm City (basically any type of marketplace with built in immutable reputation), rideshare is coming soon.

Thank you for finding and reporting this. Sincerely.
