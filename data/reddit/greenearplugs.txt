can you run the math of 8mb blocks costing "thousands of dollars a year"??  8mb is 420gb a year.  Thats a cheap hard drive and a basic home internet connection allows at least 1tb a year downloads.  Not disagreeing with the caution regarind hard forks, but if we could get a successful 8mb hard fork, i really don't think its gonna be the expensive for miners.

Here's the problem.  This type of stuff has been going on since civilization started.  At its root, two parties disagree.  Ego, etc get in the way.  Its not changing
I can smell and stalemate a mile a way, and this whole debate has stalemate written all over it.  The two sides will never agree.  Its time to shit or get off the pot.  
Why does everyone insist that there must be one damn blockchain.  Anarchists are fine with competing legal agencies etc and view it as a benefit.  A and B disagree...let them go their separate ways.  Fork it.

@_date: 2015-06-21 18:05:11
just thinking outloud...one possible solution to this high $2.9 per tx problem is to first cap the limit.  Call it 1mb for simplicity.  Then all or at least 99% of transactions are done off blockchain, and the on blockchain transactions are only done by third party payment processors...say once a week or something like that.  This allows for very high security ($1T + per year like in my example above), but low per tx fees since payment aggregators take millions of tx, and put it on blockchain with one very high fee payment (spreading out of tx fee happens).  thoughts?

I never guaranteed That transactions would grow at 86% per year, but taht 86% is based on some sort of reality.  annualized growth in tx for past 12 months has been 76%...annualized for past 24 months = 119%...for last 36 months = 154%.
at 154% annual growth, that would mean by 2027, literally EVERY transaction in the world (cash, credit card, etc) would be done on the blockchain.
Here's what 154% tx growth looks like on my spreadsheet (note. this assumes no growth in the verification per second number.  I thinks theres a decent chances we get well above 20K, even 50K tx verifations per second in the coming years)

I'm coming to the point where i actually just think it should happen.  Why does everyone have to agree?   so what if dollars are lost or we get two chains...we can handle it at this point, and I think the lessons people learn from it would be valuable for the future.
I'm just curious to see what would happen
At the end of the day no one is going to ever fully agree on this (aren't a lot of bitcoiners anarchocapitalists?  we don't insist on the everyone being the same damn security agency...i don't see why we can't have bitcoin with 1mb block and another bitcoin with 40%/yr increasing block size...  Present both choices, and users will decide on one.  I say gavin's just writes the code, and we see how many adopt it
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:32:55
When you compare non zero wallet growth vs tx growth you see that as we double users, that transaction rates about double as well (tx don't go up 4x - ie no metcalffs law)
over past 36 months, nonzero wallets have grown .722M to 4.8M (6.6x increase).  Tx per day over that same 36 month period have grown 18K to 116K (6.44x increase)
@_date: 2015-06-13 00:35:13
right, and there's certainly reasonable limits to how many forks you want.  I'm not advocating forks for every little disagreement.  But the idea that bitcoin can NEVER fork just seems off to me.  
could you explain more "instead you just get failure"?   Say 70% of miners go to one fork, other 30% go to another.  Whats the issue with that?  Sure transactions during the fork etc are stopped.   Bitcoin can survive that.  It would be huge growing pains, but i'm fine with a few bumps.  Hell bitcoin transactions being halted for 72 hours tomorrow, imo wouldn't kill bitcoin.  Not even close. 
Eventually if two parties can't agree, then it sometimes makes sense to part ways.  Sure there are costs to that.  in this case, yes, bitcoin may suffer bad publicity.   Millions of dollars might be lost.   imo so be it.  Frankly, with an issue as big as blocksize, millions of dollars may have to be lost in order get out the other end with some sort of steady state.  
I don't buy the doomsday, "if bitcoin forks" then value of btc on both chains goes to $0.  I could be wrong on that and def open to criticism
edit: I also think we are WAY to worried about publicity right now.  the average person ALREADY thinks that using bitcoin will cost them a ton of money...or thats its illegal...or just magic internet money etc.  That isn't going away for a long long time and transactions being halted for 72 hours will have practically ZERO affect on your average citizens view of bitcoin.  We should just ignore it...do what is good for the econsystem, and let bitcoin growth continue on its organic 40-60% growth in new users per year as it has for the last 5 years.  We can worry about publicity in 2030, when we have 800M world wide users

This or something like it will ultimately remove the need for bank accounts.  Here's how i see it playing out.  You set up a bucket of cold storage wallets (create lets say 10,000 addresses...all via cold storage...pain in the ass to do, but with 10K addresses you are set for life/decades).  
Make a program that auto forwards living expenses every month to a hot wallet (say say 7 btc per month at todays prices).  In this way, risks are minimized (can only lose 7 btc if hacked) and yet you don't have to go through the pain in the ass of getting your keys out of cold storage every month
Boom...no more need for a checking account/banks (for 99% of folks at least).  Only fees would be the fees for a safety deposit box ($100/year or something like that)

thats what i'm aguing against.  The deflationary spiral has limits.  The price corrects for those limits.  Thats like saying "at no price am i willing to give up my bitcoin in exchange for a house, because the value of bitcoin is rising".  Sure its rising, but there is a price where the opportunity cost is higher than actually just completing the purchase.  Lets use extremes (because it can at least disprove you in theory).
Bitcoin is rising in price.  we all agree on that.  I offer to sell my $1 million dollar house to you for 2000 bitcoins.  At this point you will prob decline, and say...no, i think the 2000 bitcoins will be worth more in the future than the house so i will keep my bitcoins.   I would agree.  You could say, "see, bitcoins ever increasing value is preventing spending etc".  In this case you would be right.  But this ignores the price flexibility/negotiation.  In reality the homeowner (or others like him) would say "ok, 2000 bitcoins is too much...how bout i offer you my million dollar house for .5 bitcoins?".  Of course anyone with half a brain would agree to this deal and buy the house for .5 bitcoins.  
That is an extreme, but it shows how the price flexibility is used to actually facilitate economic transactions.  We don't just stop spending all together...we lower prices to better reflect the deflationary aspect of bitcoin or whatever currency we are dealing with.  In this, the real life example would be that the house sells for something between the extremes i used of 2000btc (high end...horrible dealer for original btc holder) and .05 btc (low end...horrible deal for original house owner)

who says there needs to be control over the monetary policy?  Again, read some monetary history about the 19th century.  There were long periods of time without a central banks and wealth grew just as fast if not faster during these times.  You've been brainwashed into thinking that an economy must have a central bank in order to function properly.
Banks don't just stop lending if the inflation rate is at -2% (deflation of 2% like bitcoi n will be eventually).  All that happens is that prices adjust so that it eventually becomes profitable to lend again...simply at different prices.
Lets take an example.  right now you are saying, because my bitcoin is going to be worth more in the future, i will never spend it (on the same token, that means banks will never lend it, as you've mentioned early).  For a simple, example, if you were entirely in bitcoin and you wanted to buy a flatscreen tv for the equivalnt of $600 (1 btc for our example), you as a consumer would not do that because you'd say the btc will be worth more in the future, than the TV.  You'd be correct.  However, what your ignoring is that prices adjust for this.  So no one would sell you a TV for $600 equivalent.  However if they sold you a TV for $1 equivalent, you would surely buy, regardless of what you thought btc prices would do in the future.  This is an extreme, and the reality would be somewhere in between $1 and $600 for the TV, but the point is that prices will adjust to account for an appreciating currency vs a decpreciating currency.  You idea of "no transaction will occur...at any price" is simply false and is disproved by the fact that you would exchange $1 in btc for a new flatscreen TV

@_date: 2014-02-26 22:50:35
incorrect.  They have less incentive to spend something if they think the FUTURE price will be higher. If something (ie bitcoin) has increased in price drastically but a user believes that fair value has been reached, then he is MORE likely to spend the bitcoin as it approaches fair value and certainly once it reaches fair value
We are seeing this now.  Everyone has very different views on what bitcoin's fair value is.  Those spending coins now believe we have reached it...those hoarding think there is more price increases to come.  Past price moves have no fundamental affect on whether someone spends a coin (though maybe past increases have a psychological affect...but it is irrational to spend coins based on past price moves...should only spend based on current market price in relation to fair value

What is your fair value price of bitcoin?  Is it less than $1000? If so why did you buy at $1000?  if not, then why in the world you do anything but hold (hell, buy more). 
This illustrates why 90% of bitcoiners have no idea about what the fair value of bitcoin is and therefore have no idea when to buy and sell.  They are emotionally at the whim of market momentum.

actually yes thats what i'm arguing for.  I'm under no illusion that will actually happen, but bitcoin allows for a small part of my world to be my utopia.   Go ahead and try to regulate bitcoin.  Sure some exchanges will be regulated but some will also avoid regulation and people will lose money under both regulated and unregulated exchanges.  Do your own due deligence. Nothing is without risk, but you should minimize them.  Buying off coinbase and instantly xfering to cold storage means you are basically 99% assured that if you coins are stolen/lost then it was your fault.

now yes.   I believe over time it will become more stable than say the argentinian peso.  The biggest draw down over the past few years has been about 80% for bitcoin (and you would have to buy at top and sell at bottom).  argentinian peso is decling in value STEADILY over 50% a year.   what would you rather own?  I'd argue even at this point bitcoin is more stable.  Certainly as bitcoin increases in market cap, then volatility will go down.
And really what matters is downward volatility.  You could argue that upward volatility (maiinly what bitcoin is) actually INCREASES adoption rate etc
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:52:04
i'v run various calculations.  I tend to believe in zipfs law instaed of metcalfs law.  Basically, the market cap rises in a 1:1 fashion with adoption.  2x the user, and you'll 2x the price (metcalf would 4x the price for ever 2x in users)
From this i've tried to jduge "how many real users there are".  Some may quible with this, but i'm going to call a real user anyone from .1 or .2 btc or above to their name (i don't consider someone with .01 btc a true user)
Various estimates are around, but there are about 500K people with above .1btc.  I also looked at the nubmer of users on bitcointalk.org...there were about 360K.  So we are in the right ballpark.  if someone is decently serious at btc they've prob registered at bitcointalk.org.
Using that, i went BACK in time and looked at the nubmer of users at bitcointalk.org at any given time, and correlated it with price.
End result....(again assuming fundamental btc price rises in 1:1 fashion with new users), we should be at around $60 per bitcoin right now...and it grows in price/# of users about 50% per year.   This is about in line with the early internet growth too.
Interesting stuff....we may have a ways to fall yet, what with all the mt Gox artificially buying now gone

we are still 5x to 10x too high on btc price based on number of users.  i don't expect us to hit btc fair value of $500 for another 3 years or so...with a doubling in price/year after that.. so not the end of the world...just gotta be patient

If you knew two shits about investing, you'd know its not an exact science.  I believe there to be a margin of safety, and I don't think a government banning it changes anything (would you call warren buffett's stock picks a "belief"...he may not agree with bitcoin, but my investment process is directly from him).  again, if you're surprised at this, then why did you even invest in the first place.  
In fact anyone who knows anything about bitcoin realizes, that the reason it is decentralized is for this very reason.  Otherwise some other form of previous centralized ecurrency would've succeeded (they didn't because governments shut them down).

ughhh this is a retarded argument.  In theory you are correct. In practice, user adoption is increasing, and price is likely to go up in the future.  If bitcoin is at a lower value than say $600 in 5 years, i'm not going to blame "inflation".  I'm going to blame a lack of new users
furthermore, as I've explained many times before, fees will likely go down in the future:

i eventually think there will be some sort of verification process, whereby if you want quick transaction for a large amount, then a third party escrow/insurer will verify your IDentity to your bitcoin wallet.   From there, it provides insurance in the case of fraud (which should be low cost, because anyone committing fraud will have their ID with the third party entity).
You could also do off blockchain transactions for 90% of the purchases world wide...with bitcoin acting as a reserve currency for the various thirty party operators that do off blockchain transactions.  
again...off blockchain transactions are fine...even for a super libertarian like me, as long as the OPTION exists for on blockchain transaction.  Simply having this options, makes the off blockchain operators much more honest
You're correct...bitcoin is not perfect.  its just better than all the alternatives.  Again, in my scenario above, the costs, price guarantee and transaction time are all equal to or better than the current credit card/banking system
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:30:40
you're comparing a payment processor (paypal) to a currency (bitcoin). 
The correct comparison is between the dollar and bitcoin.  If you like the dollar, then by all means go ahead and keep trusting it.  dont use bitcoin.  
(btw, paypal could easily process bitcoins...which makes youre scenarios basically the same - same amount of trust.  Paypal...You're basically describing an escrow service which has risks as well as benefits.  Bitcoin escrow services could exist to that give you the same sort of moneyback guarantee that dollar based paypal does now.  ie bitcoin based paypal)

again, you have to account for barrier of entry.  Its very easy to switch from myspace to facebook...Less easy (and there are significant costs) from switching from bitcoin to some alt coin...and it gets harder and harder as btc grows in value.

i don't care if its not zero fee (or low fee like bitcoin).  Thee is always going to be a fee charged by mastercard.  This is a good bridge taht allows me to spend bitcoin for the same price as i would spend fiat.  Options are good
Eventually, merchants will accept bitcoins directly, and then much lower fees will follow
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:29:46
not sure if i understand.  Could you reword it diffferently...
The value of the network eventually will be minimum amt that the general population deems necessary to make 51% attack unfeasible. 
Under your scenario, we have 1000TPS and a cost of 51% attack at 50B (miners fees at 1cent per tx, 1000TPS is about $1M per day...$30M per month).  Sure...someone could spend 50B to overtake the network.  It would go down for a bit no doubt and be a big issue.  But 50B is a lot of money to spend and i'm not sure that it could take down the network for a long period of time before being discovered.  Furthermore, the high dollar amt is so that in unfeasible for almost anybody to actually implement without being noticed.  Even if we don't notice the attempted 51% attack on the network...its become practically very difficult to manufacture 50B worth of chips without anyone noticing. 
Again, i'm not saying this is 100% likely to happen..just attacking the notion that its impossible to have low fees.  There are scenarios where the math works out and everything is done ON blochain

My main concern is how we get past he volatility (if its to be used as a currency...volatility with store value calc is less important).

I would agree with your points about what the "right answers".  BUt what i find odd about your position is that you seem to think that a government backed currency isn't using force to impose its monopoly status as a currency.  Many centralized e currencies were shut down by the US government (hence why bitcoin is decentralized).  This is absolutely the use of force, and an infringement on my rights as a human
The euro and every other fiat currency that enjoys monopoly status as a currency is absolutely in place because of the direct use of force.  If i try to use another my own currency in the US i'm arrested (at least that was true before bitcoin...though i fully expect the US to outlaw bitcoin as some point in the near future).
The difference with bitcoin is that it is very difficult for countries to ban it in practice, even if they want to.  Look at the bittorent. it has done well because its impossible to shut down.  IN third world countries, it is even more difficult to enforce these rules (black markets are huge in third world countries because enforcement there is not as good).  Eventually bitcoin could reach a critical mass in these countries, that the countries will be essentially forced into legalizing it.  As the network effect grows, the may even be forced to accept taxes in bitcoins.

incorrect.  The holding period of any asset is important.  Just like holding fiat and only xfering to bitcoin for bitcoin purchases is not helpful to bitcoin (most merchants do this by instantly xfering to fiat after someone pays in btc). By that same logic, only reversed...if i'm paid my salary in fiat, but instantly convert it to bitcoin, i'm contributing to a lower value for said fiat currency...all else being equal.  If the entire population instantly converted to bitcoin from fiat, then fiat would be worth orders of magnitude less than today because of the huge increase in velocity of the fiat money.

i think it will play out like this.   General non mining bitcoin users (or anyone really) can invest in large mining corporations (say by paying a set fee) but not have to be involved in the day to day operations.  for that fee these users will be entitled to x% of the mining corporation profit and just as importantly have a proportional vote in what the mining corporation does (ie vote on whether to adopt a new bitcoin protocol etc).  This will combat the idea of the miners really be centralized and run in by a small amount of people.  
The stock market for bitcoin miners will decentralize mining decision making, just as the New york stock exchange decentralizes the decision making process for companies by coca cola, but selling a % of the company in the form of stock.  If my mining corporation does something i don't like...i can first vote against their actions and secondly/more severely, sell my stock in that mining corporation and invest in one that shares my same philosophy

The govt most certainly was "helping" before the financial crisis.  One example is that FDIC in itself leads to extra risk taking because people know that if a bank goes insolvent then their money is still safe. This means they do less/no due diligence on whether a bank is in sound financial conditions, which leads to banks having no checks against taking stupid risks, which leads of course to banks taking those stupid risks(they get the upside, and experience no downside if they lose the bet)

going to expand further on some number.  Currently the total block reward (including block reward and tx fees) is about $13,000.  This gives us network security (ie cost of mounting a 51% attack) of around $50 Million to $700 million
Now lets assume a world in the far future after 2040 where there is essentially no block reward and miners are only compensated via transaction fees.  Its a little of a chicken and egg problem, but if bitcoin takes off and can get to 1000 transactions per second (tps)  (VISA is at 2000 tps right now). and we assume 25 cents per transaction, then the total block would be worth $150,000 (about 10x of today...ie mounting a 51% attack now costs $500M to $7 billion).
but this basically assumes no micro-transaction (the market for micro-transactions is largely non existent right now).  Lets say, that with the addition of micro-transactions, we can get to 10,000 or even 50,000 transactions per second (automated machine to machine btc xfers, etc).  this would require a lower fee.  
Here's what the total block reward would be assuming no new minted bitcoins, and using various figures for 1) transaction per second and 2) fee per transaction in $:
Miners Fees per block from Tx fees| $ per Tx | $ per Tx| $ per Tx | $ per Tx | $ per Tx |
**TPS**  |  **$.01** | **$.05** | **$.10** | **$.25** | **$.50** |
**1000** | $6,000 | $30,000 | $60,000 | $150,000 | $300,000 | 
**5000** | $30,000 | $150,000 | $300,000 | $750,000 | $1,500,000 | 
**10000** | $60,000| $300,000 | $600,000 | $1,500,000 | $3,000,000 | 
**25000** | $150,000 | $750,000| $1,500,000 | $3,750,000| $7,500,000 | 
**50000** | $300,000 | $1,500,000 | $3,000,000| $7,500,000 | $15,000,000 | 
edit: lets assume we want a fixed $ amt to mount a 51% attack ($3-4 Million per block chain equates to a 50B to 100B cost of 51% attack which seems fine to me).  Under my example that would be 10 cents per transaction at 50K tps.  But in 20 years, internet connection speed wont be the bottleneck at all (in 20 years, a standard home internet connection will handle 20 Million TPS technically!).  So lets say we start getting 500K tps or 1M tps..its a good feedback loop.  The more TPS we have, the cheaper each tx gets, and thus we have even more and more micro-spending markets that previously didn't exist (tipping to get in the fast lane while driving etc...you could have hundreds of these microtips per trip if transaction fees got to say 1/2 of 1 cent. Under this scenario 1M TPS doesn't seem all that crazy ( i swipe my visa a few times a day. I could see microtransactions for myself being over 100 per day at least in the future)
at tx fee of $.005 and 1 Million TPS...the block reward would be 3M (or about 100B to mount a 51% attack)

there are many semi-private roads today that poor people use in the US.  The new jersey turnpike, etc.  You can generally make a road without charging a crazy fee. (again the turnpike isn't crazy expensive).
If they are really poor, then they prob wouldn't have a car in either scenario and would take some sort of mass transit system (which should be private too btw) to save costs.
Not perfect, but the alternative the we have today isn't perfect.  Many poor people don't own cars today and the world doesn't fall apart.  
I'm a libertarian and i don't think public roads are the first government expenditure that should be removed (its a relatively small % of govt spending right now) but in a pure logic stance, this is where i'm at.  I would never harp on this in a public debate though.   Much more long hanging fruit that should be looked at first.

fair enough, but it gets harder and harder to supplant bitcoin as it grows.  Its certainly possible it will get beat, but think of all the news coverage etc.  Is a competitor going to really beat that at this point in the game (short of a huge technological improvement)?  what tech improvements does bitcoin need that it isn't addressing?
and again the barrier to entry for even smaller alt coins etc is still very much higher than a free facebook signup.  there are alt coins that are worth a total of say $5M.  the psychological barrier of actually putting your dollars in that small alt coin is still orders of magnitude higher than signing up for facebook for free.  Theres no drawback to the free facebook signup.  Theres a psychological risk of xfering $ via bank, etc (could get money stolen...many of my friends don't want to give out bank info to coinbase etc...even if they only plan on buying $5)

I go back and forth, but there is a precedent for many currencies that weren't great at being a unit of account (ie stable).

You should look up the defintion of money...there are 3 main components and what your talking about is the Unit of account function.  This is basically the standard by which everything else is used.   Its hard to imagine now, because we only have one currency in the US which also happens to be the unit of account for most of the world.  But there is nothing fundamental about the dollar being a unit of account.  It could be something else (ie bitcoin) if enough people agree on it.  
The pound sterling used to be the world's reserve currency.   Now its the dollar.  Eventually the dollars reign will end.  Will it collapse? that depends on your definition...but currencies go in and out of favor over time.

it will be interesting because a lot of the need for banking might go away with bitcoin.
Right now i pay off my credit card every month and keep a few thousand dollars in my checking account for monthly purchases, etc.   But with bitcoin why do i need to store the money in the bank?  No only does my btc increase in value (because it is deflationary), but i pay no fees etc for holding, whereas i pay someone at JP morgan for the privilege of loaning them my money.  Its almost like we could be going back to "storing our money under the mattress" but in this case the mattress is much safer for storage. Thats not a bad thing

what makes you think that we should use Reed's law?  Reed's law is even faster growing that metcalfs law.
Just for some quick numbers,  lets assume we have 3M users now...with market cap of 7B
with 6M users bitcoin would be valued at 77B
with 12M users it would valued at 750B
and at 24M with over 75T...which is more than all the money in the world.
Reed's law seems unrealistic
with zipfs law, 1B world wide users, is about 100K per bitcoin or 3 Trillion...which is more realistic.  Its atleast within 1 order of magnitude

there is potential for more stability than 3rd world country currencies (and therefore bitcoin would be value added).  Once it is established there, you can determine a fundamental base floor value for bitcoin based on the velocity of money calculation (ie minimum currency needed in order to service a given economy size).  This can grow gradually.
Initially, yes, it is speculation that drives the value of bitcoin.  but if this speculation drives bitcoin to a minimum size, then it provides bitcoin with enough liquidity to be used in smaller countries.  This further increases the liquidity and stability so that larger and larger nations can adopt it over time.

thats not true at all.  GPD/capita rose at exactly the same rate during the free banking era as with a central bank.

my point is it doesn't really matter how many current users there are...Only the growth rate.  Bitcoin is growing at 50-100% per year in users.  Not saying it will succeed...only attacking the idea that "there aren't enough users!"
The ipad comparison is not even close to fair.  the Ipad was marketed by apple which gave it a huge head start.  Bitcoin grew organically with no public concerted marketing etc.  It started from zero.  
edit: i should further add that these comparisons are not fair.  For example...whatapp growth was hugely popular and grew much faster than say the internet.  You have to look at start up costs for consumers when looking at adoption rates.   whatsapp, facebook etc are free to use.  The ipad is expensive but not a ton of psychological risk etc.  Its basically a computer that people have been buying for years.  Now take bitcoin (or the internet even).  That is a huge change form what people are used to.  Its naturally going to take time and the adoption rate will be slower.  Its much less psychologically scary for someone to buy an ipad, than put $500 into bitcoin.  for now at least

i came across as rude.  My apologies
my point was the using order books to judge market sentiment is dangerous.  The best way to judge market sentiment is the actual price.  For example..i have never once placed a non market order for bitcoin, so my purchases never show up on the order book. Most people are like this...furthermore, it is easily manipulated when someone puts in a large market order.
all btc are always for sale.  Even if they aren't on the order book...they are always for sale and you say that just becuase the order book has x coins for sale, that 50x coins won't come on the market in the next second.

The market would fix all these issues.  The govt should never worry about Unions.  If a group of workers want to organize, then they should be free to do so.

fuck off dude.  i used a number to make a general point.  if i hadn't used a number the point wouldn't have been as easy to understand.  If you had half a brain you would know that 500B wasn't a hard number and that its a wild estimate at this point anyways. 
If you think that 500B is used with any accuracy then you're retarded anyways.  The swings on that estimate have a huge margin of error.  I assumed everyone know that.  I guess i was wrong.  You'd be much happier if i said "bitcoin will be worth 567,784,393,838.37 on jan 1, 2020" even though thats a ridiculous statement to make.
It goes without syaing that bitcoin succeeding = $100B -30T market cap.  I have no fucking clue exactly what the end number will be.  Its an estimate.
The general point is, it will be order of magnitude large than todays prices, so and that will necesssarily influence the feds future decion.  Regulations for a 6B industry are usually different than a $6T industry (and don't fucking quote me on the 6T, its an EXAMPLE!

and furthermore, there are many things that are insured that if lost, can never be recovered etc.  The idea is you minimize the loss, because if you lose it, its gone.  For example.  Car insures never "Get back" or "recover their losses" when looking at any one accident.  Any one accident is always a loss. The insurer makes money by trying minimize accidents and charging an appropriate freedom.  
For example, you could have a bitcoin bank store customer funds.  lets say they have 500 customers, with 100M in total bitcoin funds.  Some large reinsurer could estimate the chance of that bank getting hacked, and insur that 100M.  Sure if the bank DID get hacked, the 100M would be gone forever. But that doesn't mean there isn't a price at which the reinsurer would be willing to accept as a fee for that risk (i'm sure the reinsurer would demand certain protocols be followed, etc).  but it wouldn't hinge on the recovery of funds in the event of a theft.  It would aim at determining the odds of a theft and then charging an appropriate fee based on those odds

So there's also a debate between using zipf's law or metcalf's law.  for those unfamiliar, metcalf's law says for every doubling of users you 4x the price.   Zipfs says for every doubling of users you only double the price. 
I think in reality we will be closer to zipfs law (using metcalfs law leads to values in the trillions of dollars with only a few million users = unrealistic). But i think we will actually be in between.  If zipfs laws uses a 1x multiple and metcalfs uses a 2x, i think in reality we may follow a 1.1 or 1.2 multiple.  That would increase the estimated value of bitcoin (specifically im thinking  - active addresses - though could in theory apply it to others).  
Anyways, Im prob digging too deep here.  All this stuff has huge wild margins of error. any future estimate at this point...even estimates a few short years out (2018 and 2019 still tough/impossible to predict)

its free banking.  You can choose to use it or not. But we should certainly have the OPTION to do what i described.
bitcoin only purists misunderstand the whole point of bitcoin.  The main idea is to eventually end the monopoly that fiat money has over the term "currency".  bitcoin is one way to do this.  But you should also be in favor or other forms of currency circulating and letting the market decide.  
I would have no issue with using "coinbase notes" for small purchases etc if it facilitated easier xfer of monies, etc.  though taht would be up to individuals to decide on their own

fair enough...i think we largely agree
i was more addressing people who are demanding something like ecash for day to day fully anonymous purchases.  The tech may be anonymous, but the second you start spending it it becomes much less anonymous.
what we need is a decently anonymous electronic currency that is easy to spend and prohibitively expensive to de-anonymize amongst a large user base.   I think bitcoin meets these demands and then some (accounting for future innovations in coin join, dark wallet, etc)

IT has inflation to ease the distribution of coins.  If all coins existed the second bitcoin was created, then the early adopters would have an even larger % of coins than they do currently.
furthermore, you need the block reward to reward miners as bitcoin grows.  once we get to a higher transaction rate, then transactions alone will be fine...but we aren't there yet, and its unreasonable to expect that kind of growth early on...hence the block reward and inflation

OK, so i'm still trying to understand ethereum
Now i like to imagine extremes.   Lets say all contracts in world are using etherium only, and ethereum is the only for of currency in the world.  To value ethereum under these assumptions, you could first start off with the standard ratio of GDP to money supply (same calc as in bitcoin, with minor inflation being the only difference, and that difference being negligible over the long term).  But ethereum would have even more value than this basic calc because of the other contracts that it facilitates, etc.  Do i have this correct?  Ethereum can in theory be used as a currency and IN ADDITION can be used to facilitate contracts (in effect each of the contract fees are just like any other form of spending, therefore increasing the ethereum GDP and therefore increasing the value of each ether as well???)

Please don't lie and tell people you have more.  I'm TRUSTING YOU!  do you see how that system would be easily gamed?  Hnce the need for billions in dollars of mining equipment to prevent you and me from counterfeiting the currency.
on the other hand...i would trust (moreso) a currency backed by amazon or google.  Though i woudln't trust those currencies as much as i do bitcoin.  Its a personal preference.

His point about transaction fees is off.  Once the block reward is zero, then the network will be paid for entirely by transaction fees.  We don't know what those will be, but it will be a balance between 1) making a sufficiently expensive network so that gaining 51% is difficult/expensive while 2) keeping transaction costs low.  Imagine btc as a world currency, with equivalent of about $60T in GDP. If it cost $500B to mount a 51% attack (ie cost of network) that would be very expensive and unlikely, while still maintaining expense ratios of well under 1%.
The deflation issue has been addressed before. We have had deflationary currencies in the US for long periods of time (free banking era, etc) and the economy did just fine (may have even grown quicker than average).  See this:

same story for gdp per capita (completely different source since you seem to think this is a libertarian conspiracy):
I can find a bunch of other sources...but why you don't provide to me a source the contradicts the info i've presented.  GDP is a common figure and the likely hood of someone falsifying it is low/easily recognizable.  If you have contradictory info that shows gdp/capita growing at anything but 2% annually since 1800, then i would like to see it.
I love it when hotheads like you say "oh your source is biased"...then do nothing to specifically refute why my source is wrong, and further...you don't provide an alter source the disproves the accuracy of the data i presented
Secondly the dollar has been deflationary ever since 1913.  Its been rather consistent.  I'm arguing that it is not necessary for there to be inflation in order for there to be economic growth (as measured by gdp/capita).  Inflation or deflation doesn't matter. what does matter is that the inflation/deflation should be consistent (-2% or +2% per year) and predictable (not 50% one year and -10% another).
Bitcoin would meet all of these criteria.  It will/is deflating wildly for a few years, but volatility/deflation rate will decrease as adoption increases.  Eventually, the deflation rate of bitcoin would be very stable if accepted as a world wide currency (deflation rate would approximate the growth in the economy/gdp which as shown above has been a pretty steady 2% a year since the industrial revolution)

Read Satoshi's posts...his main reason for making it decentralized was because previous e-currencies were easily shut down by the gov't because the very nature of centralization made it easy to track/destroy

its funny b/c with the blockchain you can actaully track number of active addresses over time.  I track these monthly.  Again for the last 18 months or so we've been growing at a 50% annual rate, from a base of 200K users or so.  For those of you who don't know exponential math: By that rate of growth we have about 1B users in 20 years....10B (entire world) in 25 years.
That may be too slow for you, but its plenty quick for me.  in 1980 there were 1000 internet users....1990 there were 2M,  by 2000 there were 400M.  These things take time.
your mistake is comparing facebook/whatsapp adoption to things like the internet/cellphones/bitcoin
facebook etc is free to sign up, and no psychological barrier to entry.  the internet and bitcoin involve actually spending money getting setup etc.  Big phychological leap to get involved etc.  These things obviously take more time for users to get used to that signing up for a website where i post my picture online and like cat videos for free

again...third world countries will adopt first because of the greater stability of bitcoin vs third world countries.  This grows the size of bitcoin...makes it more stable.  Now middle income countries make it their national curreny.  This adds further stability.  Eventually stability is no longer the driving force of adoption (because most 1st world countries have stable currencies..though i might argue that won't necesssarily always be true...but my bitcoin thesis doesn't hinge on the US dollar becoming hyperinflationary etc).  1st world adoption will be because it is easier to transact and deal with other world citizens in bitcoin vs US dollars.  Why exchange things, etc when you can use a world currency.  Again i think this will take a few decades
Furthermore, i'm not 100% this is how it plays.  but i've assigned a % chance of it happening and done an expected value calculation with those assumptions.  Any who does this and assigns a probability above say 1% will see that the expected value is multiples of todays current price.

I have no idea what your first sentence is saying.  What i'm saying is that you first should determine the fair value of bitcoin (regardless of market price...my fair value is well north of $10K/btc).  If market price offers a margin of safety (ie market price is well below what you determine fair value is), then buy.  Sell when it approaches fair value. 
Any other method is a crock of shit, and you will likely lose money/not maximize profits.  But whatever, there are a bunch of idiot traders here who think otherwise.  I'm sure because someone made money for 1 year they actually think they have skills etc. I don't buy it.  
Furthermore, your example above is horse shit.  I could say the same thing about putting $ into roulette.  Sure, if i win, i win a lot, and if i lose, i'm "still relatively young and have all life ahead to make up for anything" as you say.  Its still a shitty bet.  Expected value is the only calculation you should be making.

what are your thoughts on comparing bitcoin to the current money supply.
Is m2 the most relevant comparision as most of m2 is in accounts that hope to simply track inflation (saving accounts etc)?  Bitcoin will obviously track with inflation and if was a world currency would increase in value at the pace of GDP growth (as GDP grows, fixed bitcoin supply is divided into a ever growing pie)

copy and pasted from another comment.  In theory you're correct.  In reality you are not:
"carry that (the plan on only risking x% of your bankroll per bet) out to infinity and eventually you'll have a bad enough losing streak that your risking a fraction of a penny (ie in a practical sense) you'll be broke.
Remember...you only need to hit zero once to be fucked. In a world with a infinitely divisible currency you could theoretically maintain a non zero balance. In reality once you hit .1 of a cent you're essentially broke
This is basic math
@_date: 2014-01-27 16:40:32
good stuff.
Regarding the winklevoss twins...I'm would say that you shouldn't agree to a contract denominated in bitcoins if you weren't comfortable with the volatility...Though any contract is subject to volatility even USD (though it is much lower).  Its a false comparision you made because if btc was a large as we are talking about (a global currency) then btc would be just as subject to manipulation as the current USD is subject to manipulation (Bill gates and warren buffet could cash out dollars for gold and cause a small drop in the USD - though comparable to what the winklevoss could do if btc $5M ever came true).  Furthermore, as the value of btc rises, the winklevoss or other major holders will likely sell some of their holdings and the % of all btc owned by them will be reduced (and therefore their ability to game the market is also reduced).  I also don't have a problem if anyone wants to dump their btc in hopes of creating a panic and trying to buy back lower.  I'm skeptical this can work over the long term, but regardless I think this a freedom that anyone should be allowed.  As a long term holder you won't get hurt by short term fluctuations and the only people who will lose money are the people who sell in a short term panic.  its the same thing with stocks. If warren buffet wants to cash out his BRK stock in hopes of buying lower, i think he should be allowed to do so (though the current US law doesn't agree with me). I've arrived at my fair value of BRK stock and if he causes a panic, then if anything i'll buy more. I certainly wouldn't sell the stock.  If no one sells then this method of panic buying becomes very hard for a major player to organize. 
Regarding the recent depression etc...imo you're right we did avoid a depression by using the TARP funds.  all else being equal i think TARP was a good thing considering that no one is seriously considering getting rid of the fed.  If you assume the fed must exists, then TARP was prob a good thing.  However my ideal scenario is getting rid of the fed and letting each individual be responsible for the "safety nets" that the current fed/FDIC etc gives us.  I think this would lead to more robust balance of risk than the present system.  And again, we have to seperate between deflation caused by govt induced inflation (great depression, the 2008 recession, etc) and a constant/predictable deflating money supply.  A main driver of the housing bubble was the fed lowering interest rates after the dotcom crash.  This extra money had to find a home somewhere, and it found it in rising housing prices.  the deflation of 2008 would have been much less severe/non existent if not for the proceeding inflation from 2002-2008 that was caused by a lower interest rate from the fed.
I do NOT think deflation is a panecea.  I think the world would function just as well with a 2% deflation rate vs a 2% inflation rate.  My argument is that we all assume inflation is under control because its been low for a certain amount of time.  I don't think this is true and believe the next few years should show this. The federal reserve, when looking over the past 100 years, has seen periods of very high inflation (1980s etc).  This isn't the end of the world, but i think that a constant deflation/inflation rate run by a computer program is a better option (friedman said he prefereed a computer program with a low steady inflation rate.  I'm fine with that).  If bitcoin has a 1% INFLATION rate programmed in, I would still love it.  All i'm arguing against is the idea that "because it has a 1% DEFLATION rate that it is doomed to failure".  Minor deflation/inflation are the same thing in my mind as far as economic performance and both allow for a fully functional economy.  The main benefit of bitcoin is that the deflation/inflation rate is programmed in, and not adjustable by some central authority which is prone to other incentives/corruption.  You say the fed is unaccountable...I agree. I just don't think they ever will be held accountable.  Why not have a system like bitcoin where you don't have to rely on a central authority being held accountable...this rarely happens over a long period of time.  When governments get in control of the money supply they inflate it away (going back to your other point previously, it was actually the debasement of metal currencies (ie INFLATION) that contributed to growing unease in many of the historical empires you listed (roman, etc:
Regarding BOOMs being unsustainable i prefer to think of it in terms to credit to GDP ratio.  GDP grows at 2% a year and has since the industrial revolution.  You can get GDP to grow quicker than that if you increase the credit to GDP ratio but this growth is false.  You can't sustainn a 10:1 credit to GDP ratio over the long term (and certainly cant sustain the ratio GROWING over any long period of time), so the delta of growth from going from 3:1 to 10:1 is unsustainable.  What matters is the growth of the base GDP number.  Some credit is good and that is fine, but we commonly mistake short term growth in GDP for real long term progress when in fact all we did was increase credit:GDP from 3:1 to 10:1. That would be my defintion of unsustainable.  When the fed lowers interest rates it artifically creates more lending/credit and makes GDP increase.  This is an illusion in my mind.  We went from 3:1 to 4:1 but the base GDP remained constant/didn't increase as much as the fed would like you to believe.
We can see this  has bene happening by looking at historical credit:GDP numbers here:
rothbard gives many examples of a free market for various currencies in the book i recommended.

jesus christ.  Whales have no affect on LONG term value.  read some murray rothbard.  They have every right to manipulate and sell their holdings whenever and in whatever quantity they want.  If you can't handle a 20% swing, then don't fucking invest (furthermore, selling in large quantities in hopes of buying when it crashes is a logical fallacy and in practice almost impossible to do.  If selling 100K btc causes a $100 price crash, then wouldn't buying 100K btc back also cause a $100 price increase for a net profit of $0???).  Bitcoin is about complete freedom from all these bullshit insider trading laws, mandatory disclosure laws etc.  If you want some father figure government regulation then go somewhere else.  
Furhtermore, even if wealth concentration/insider trading was bad, what the fuck are you going to do to prevent this type of wealth concentration?  More regulation.  Good luck.  I'm sick of people who got their ass handed to them by doing some bullshit short term trade, and then suddenly wanting sympathy from me/bitcoin community.  Bitcoin is the big leagues...if you want more protection from you're own stupidity the go trade regulated treasury bills or some shit like that
Look it comes down to one simple fact.  People/whales can "manipulate" all they want.  If you're a long term holder it doesn't affect you at all.  If you are a short term trader then you deserve to lose your money and i have no sympathy for you.  Learn to buy/sell without emotion otherwise you deserve the shit that is coming to you.

Thanks for the response!
This first post of mine will be more clarification...and making sure were on the same page.  Once we agree on some of this stuff...i'll try and address some of the disagreements i have in another post (though i do agree with many of the points you made)
1)Historically housing prices have tracked with inflation...so wouldn't it be safe to assume that over a large population of houses/time...a house bought for 10btc in 2010 would still be sold for 10btc in 2030?
2)wouldn't wages also seem to be held constant in an all btc world?  Right now, (for years were i don't get one time promotion wage bump of say 10%) i get a cost of living increase of 2-3% so that my living standard remains the same.   In an all btc world, i obviously wouldn't get that 2-3% increase every year.  What i got paid last year (say 5 btc) would be the same as this year (5 btc) except when i get a 10% promotion every decade or so lets say (3-5 of these promotions in a career)
under current mortgages the buyer pays less and less every year in real terms...couldn't the same sort of mortgage be established in an all btc world (.4 btc first year, .375 btc the second year, etc - the math isn't exactly right here for a 30 year mortgage on a 10 btc house but you get the idea).  Would this alleviate your concern ("higher % of income for payment") about a constant/increasing (in real terms) mortgage payment over 30 years?

learned a lot about options today..and it led me to read through your comments (i like your thinking process).  You bring up a lot of good points on bitcoin...though i would like to go through a thought experiment with you.
imagine bitcoin is the world currency (no others exist).  Btc value grows at the same rate as the economy (2% per year or so).  Is it your thoughts that mortgages and other types of lending would be distroted/impossible in such a scenario?  I think it would work out but would be curious to hear more on your thoughts on the matter.
why do you think mortgages can't be made in a deflationary currency?  Can't we just add a few percentage points to the rate of return on the mortgage (regardless if the currency itself returns -2% per year under an inflationary currency OR +2% a year under a deflationary currency)

ok, we definitely disagree then (i think there is AT LEAST a 5% chance of a US ban on bitcoin in the next 10 years).  Time will tell.  I personally think that most bitcoiners should be worried about an outright ban on btc at least for a while. I hope i'm wrong, but it worries me.  
and i think it naive to say that because they are accommodating now (at a $6B market cap) then that necessarily means they will be accommodating when btc hits a $6T market cap.

buffett brings up this point, and he's not entirely incorrect.  But because the of the network effect of money, i think bitcoin will be the main winner.  We don't want to have 50 different alt coins all with the same value.  It would be too much of a pain to deal with/exchange for. Furthermore, i would challenge buffett's idea of intrinsic value.  What is the intrinsic value of the dollar?  It is that you can pay your taxes in it, which in turn is a product of most of the US citizens voting for this system.  But it still is a root based on preferences.  To say that bitcoin 100% can not become a preference, and therefore be based on the same "instrisic value" calc is off.  It may fail...but those who say it WILL fail with 100% certainty are wrong
Regarding your "to 8 decimal places" point.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding of mathematics and economics in this case.  It doesn't matter how divisible a currency is.  What matters is the % of total currency that you own...in relation to the size of the economy that said currency services.

I would do that bet though for maybe .2 bitcoins or something like that (if i lost the bet...which may happen more than 50% of the time, 100K would be a bit much for me to lose)...but i'm too lazy to sign all the paperwork etc.. just easier to spend $150 on the actual .2 bitcoin and hold

having a program that checks for double spending, you can get away with waiting on a few seconds for most purchases (say under $300).
10 minutes is still WAYYYY to long to wait for in person transactions. 
really no need for spending anywhere near $1.20 for most transactions

i'm all for it being stopped. Its complete bullshit that it happens.  Michael Lewis' new book is a perfect example how the market can deal with bullshit like this and force change...absent of government regulation. Now legally, if this sort of HFT was a breach of contract (i haven't read these contracts) then certainly a government agency could be 3rd party mediator in a class action lawsuit.  But assuming no breach of contract, then let the market decide.  HFT should certainly be legal.

no...what we're finding is that after a lifetime of daddy government protecting us from financial theft...US citizens know exactly jack shit about how to evaluate the financial health of a bank.  In the 1800s, in the free banking era, people had to do this all the time and we still survived.
Hopefully these types of losses will force people to evaluate how they decide where to store their money.  Mt gox was clearly an idiotic place to store money.  Coinbase is probably better but still may make sense for some to not store money there.  But we should no longer just store it anywhere..Think for yourself

once again i'm not guaranteeing that this will happen, just laying out one scenario that has a greater than 0% chance of happening.

thanks for the link.  I personally think that the growth to 1MB would mean many more users and a higher market cap.  This would mean that most full nodes would be big operations...where the majority of cost is spent on mining equipment, and bandwidth/storage are relatively minor costs in comparison.  We are already close to the end of the time where home users can economically mine coins.  
we'll see how it plays.  Its not a 0% chance that the tx limit becomes an issue. But i'm not really worried about it
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:22:59
its deflationary as soon as the growth in the bitcoin economy is slower that the growth of bitcoins in existence (new created - coins lost/destroyed).
That breakeven could happen much sooner than 2100.  by 2040, 99% of all coins will have been mined.   assuming btc is the world currency, and the world gdp increases at 2% a year, it would be deflationary
I don't think this is a bad thing, and as long as the deflation rate is low and predictable then there won't be a problem.  Deflation or inflation isn't inherently bad.  Its only bad when its severe in either direction and/or unpredictable.

solutions will be coming online that make it easier.  Something like a trezor wallet, stored in 2 or 3 safety deposit boxes, with automatic monthly deposits into a hot wallet are technically feasible and would allow the mass public to de-bank
another option is simply having banks that actually know what they are doing (i dont trust coinbase enough now to store coins with them,but they are on the right track...and eventually i may judge them trust worthy enough).  I know that all you new deal liberals don't study economic history before 1913, but we had a good part of the 1800s with free market banking where people actually did the due diligence you claim is unreasonable to expect of the general public.  GPD/capita etc grew just fine under that system.  Panics etc were actually less/about the same as post federal reserve era.
I don't claim to know with 100% certainty how it will work out.  Hell, bitcoin could fail, but that doesn't mean that it never could have feasibly worked.
And i never said i was being responsible when i lost the 40 coins.  I invested in something i knew little about and paid the price.  The honorable thing to do in this case is not look for assistance, learn what you can and move forward.  But let me guess...you've never made a mistake before in your life.  The difference between me and you is that when you do make that first mistake you'll look for someone else to blame.  When i make mistakes i dust myself off, learn what i can and move forward.

 a few thoughts as i'm watching:
*odd that he compares bitcoin to email when trying to temper expectations.  Sure, email hasn't lead to completely "paperless offices" but i think most here would be very happy if bitcoin matched even a fraction of emails adoption rate
*the old ideological vs adoption problem.  Not 
*desktop linux is a good analogy on how bitcoin could stagnate
*what made google maps user adoption really take off: "we (google) made google maps load faster...thats it"
*odd that he talks about bitcoins current inflation being high.  Pragmatically that is true (supply is increasing quickly compared to say m2 money supply), but in a practical sense, bitcoin has been deflationary over any substantial time frame (ie 6+ months).  thats is what users care about.  Bitcoin has been and likely will continue to be severely deflationary (price wise) for the foreseeable future
*he asks.."how can bitcoin grow faster?"  why in the world is this needed?  i'm not saying bitcoin will keep pace with the 10x per year user growth we've seen the last 2 years...but if users increase at 10x a year for the next few years, thats plenty quick enough for me
overall great talk...def disagree with some of the stuff he said but good sober analysis of where were at and the challenges ahead

fair enough point about VISA. and thats true for US citizens for everyday purchases.  But capital controls etc exist in many countries so bitcoin is a better alternative.  Furthermore, capital controls in the US are very restrictive.  Bitcoin easily supplants these controls and renders them useless.  A rich person in the US has a much easier time moving his/her money around internationally in bitcoin than in US dollars.
Tax evasion in US etc will be a large use case for bitcoin that will add much to society.
The network affect may not be huge, but i believe it will exist.  If 60% of the world is using a bitcoin i think its only a matter of time before the other 40% start using it, even if the 40% can easily convert their native currency to bitcoin (though as i mentioned above, it is NOT easy to convert large amounts to other currencies and move it around freely..and this scenario will remain as long as their are government backed currencies that are easily traceable).  But again, these use cases are for 1st world countries and I think we are at least 10 years away from that

The stickyness issue is more a human issue as opposed to being fundamental to the currency.  Right now we just fire 1 person instead of giving a 10% decrease to 10 people.  Money saved is the exact same.  In the future we have to fire 2 people to make up for the missing wage stealing that inflation accomplishes, but i don't view that as the end of the world.  in fact removing the bottom 10 or 20% of an organization is probably healthy from time to time.

The CPI index from 1776 to 1900 was unchanged.  Yet we had GDP growth per person equal to or higher than post 1913 (when fed was created).

we had a free banking era in the US.  I suggest you read up on it.   We should competition in currency and it would be on you the consumer to store your funds at banks that are responsible.  if i store my money at a strong bank, but another competing bank with a competing currency inflates their currency and they go bankrupt, then i'm still fine with my money in the safe bank.  Of course we have gotten ride of personal responsibility now in the banking system.  When was the last time you checked the solvency of the bank you went to?  No need, because daddy government is there to do the job for you.  Its just odd that people are surprised that we have too big to fail banks making reckless loans in a scenario like this.

yes, but the US is not going to outlaw US dollars.  They have less attachment to bitcoins so they will be more likely to outlaw it.
Also, its much easier to "hide" large amounts of bitcoins than dollars.  Just in a practical sense, having a few hundred million in 100's is a pain in the ass to store.  A few hundred million in Bitcoin, not so much

best case: Bitcoin gradually grows to take over the entire world's M2 money supply (inflation resistant money).  Right now that is about $60T or $3M/bitcoin.   The network work effect of money should let us transition from bitcoin in third world countries (where bitcoin is a MUCH better option) to first world countries (where bitcoin is marginally better...network effect makes it MUCH better).  10-30 years is my ETA for this.
Main issue I'm concerned with:  How does bitcoin remain a unit of account from current adoption levels, to 7B global users?  This increase in users will always cause volatility.  If i'm paid in btc and live paycheck to paycheck, but btc drops 10% in a week...then i can no longer afford rent.  We will need some sort of insurance for those who can't handle this volatility.  This is fine, but we also need to have a good portion of users actually holding btc.  We can't have 99% of btc community hedging against volatility, because who will take the other side of the that bed? (ie provide hedge and carry the holding risk)
TL;DR - Volatility could keep bitcoin from ever becoming a unit of account

there is a cost to all these government insurance programs etc.  I think the private market could do it cheaper.  Taxes etc are where the costs are seen for government backed progrmas, but these govt guarantees certainly are not free.  I happen to think a free market would provide a better solution (though getting accurate govt costs can be difficult). But furthermore i'm for a complete abolition of these government backed insurance programs based on principle.  Why am i forced into a govt insurance program?  i'd rather let the free market decide.  
Sure, exchanges are insured now (though xapo is)..but they will be in the future.  For people like you, i think you should wait to buy bitcoins until those insured exchanges come online (though the price will be higher)
we shall see if man in the middle spoofs turn out to be a big problem.  I don't think they will, but we shall see.  I think for secure websites, etc, it won't be  much of an issue as long as proper precautions are taken.
And again, even if you are worried about man in the middle attacks, then you can use an insured 3rd party bitcoin provider.  In fact in 20 years from now, i doubt many people will actually be transacting directly from one bitcoin wallet to another.  It will be 3rd party operator to 3rd party operator.  Yes this will have costs...but again, low transaction fees are not my main thesis for investing in bitcoin

random question:  Worst case scenario, the US outlaws bitcoin and holding bitcoin.
Do you guys at least store coins in security deposit boxes across the ENTIRE WORLD, so that if ALL your US boxes were compromised/confiscated by govt, you could still have access to your cold storage coins (97% of total)?
I understand if you don't want to respond for security reasons, but its at least something to think about.  I would be willing to store many more coins with coinbase if i knew this kind of nuclear option existed.  If US goes complete ban...a coinbase group of employees could go to another country where you guys also have security boxes and setup operation there, without losing all your coins.  I'm sure you guys have thought about this..but if theres anyway to make this info somewhat public, i think you would get more users and more coins stored on coinbase.  Thanks!

brockerage accounts also report your sales to the IRS, so if you don't report your stock selling then it is relatively easy for the IRS to find you
with bitcoin it can be somewhat more difficult if the user takes proper precautions.  Much harder to track
and re: al capone...the goverment went after him in every manor possible.  They only thing they couldn't fault him for was using US dollars.  They aren't going to outlaw US dollars just because capone used them as a medium of exchange.   I remain less confident that they will keep bitcoin legal...it isn't their pet project (like the US dollar) and if a modern day al capone used bitcoins, then that would provide a decent excuse for the US govt to ban bitcoin (it will be ineffective over the long run but i dont doubt the govt will try)

i would argue that a free market will provide liability protection at a cheaper rate than US government...via private insurance companies.  Xapo already has insured bitcoin deposits for only  .12% per year.  
People will have options in bitcoin that they don't have now.  For liability protection etc, you will likely have to register etc and give up anonymity.  Though with bitcoin you can xfer say $500 out of your register account into your anonymous accoutn.  Then you can mix your coins (via coin join, dark wallet etc) and spend the $500 anonymously.  You can do this with US dollars as well, by taking out $500 in cash and buying drugs.  Though i think bitcoin will allow you do remove the in person aspect of cash and do these sort of anonymous transaction electronically.
As i've said before, tax evasion will be a big use case for bitcoin.  if enough precautions are taken, bitcoin is very hard/impossible trace (especially as things like dark wallet, etc come online)

Also, for those thinking he has never spent any coins, he may have continued mining well into 2010 and 2011...and spent the coins that he mined in 2011...knowing that the later you mine coins, the more difficult it would be to say they were satoshi's (ie allows satoshi to spend anonymously, while he saves the coins that everyone knows are his (ie coins, mined in 2009)

Good summary...only point of contention is that a larger network does in fact add to security.  All things being equal i'd rather have the cost of a 51% attack be signficant (i realize its about $2Billion right now and even if mounted, it wouldn't necessarily cripple bitcoin), but i think the long term play is that transactions will eventually all be paid for by miners.  higher transaction fees = better network security.
Long term the transaction fee (and therefore the cost to mount 51% attack) will be a balance between low fees and what the btc community demands as far as a robust decentralized network that is expensive to corrupt/control

ok, i'll put aside the deflation argument for now, though i know most economists would disagree, i still believe most economist don't separate between deflation caused by a proceeding period of govt caused inflation,    And i do believe that IF bitcoin was the world currency that deflation would be predictable (hence my imaginary world story).   Much more so than the current inflation which is subject to manipulation when the fed increases the money supply. In a bitcoin only world the money supply would be fixed.  As milton friedman mentions, over an significant period of time, "inflation is purely a monetary phenomenon" (ie all the matters over the long run for inlfation/deflation is the money supply, which in our case is fixed).
As for the unpredictable nature of bitcoin on the way to it being a universal currency, there are certainly issues.  I happen to think it will be wildly volatile, but with this volatility decreasing as adoption increases (as we've seen so far).  Will this continue? i'm not sure, but the odds are not zero in my opinion.  Assuming non zero odds for a chance of btc over 100K (and really 1M/btc), then the bet is prob a decent bet to put in a small % of my portfolio.  If btc economy grows, and the odds of success grow) then in the future i may put in more $ to btc.  I believe most people will be like me except with slightly different entry points.  
And the winklevoss could cause a short term drop, just like bill gates could crash the market by selling all his microsoft stock (or china selling all its treasury bills).  But what incentive do either of these players have to do this?  and furthermore, over the long run any stock/assett will go to its fundamental value. So while the winklevoss big sell would be a short term problem there are enough other players in the market that it wouldn't cause a long term issue in my opinion.  
I think we will always disagree on whether the fed in accountable etc.  I have serious issues with their recent policy (increasing the monetary base by 3x or so).  There is a huge disagreement amoung economist now about what the reprecusions of those actions will be.  Many think that because we haven't had inflation yet, that we are through the woods.   I'm not so sure.  time will tell.

The the bigger the base of users, the less the affect of each additional user on the price.  Using extremes, if only 3 people in the world are using bitcoin then the affect of 10 new users suddenly adopting will incrase the price 3-4x.  If 3 Billion people are using bitcoin, then the affect of 3 or 4 users will be neglible.  Bigger user base = higher value = more stability in very general terms.

if everyone voted libertarian, then it would/could change.  But that will never happen.  A large % of the population will always voted for policies that benefit them directly.
However, i agree with the rest of your statement.  My best guess is the US outlaws bitcoin (or at least outlaws btc merhcants/exchanges), but other poor countries with less enforcement capability allow bitcoin.  It takes off there and maybe in 15 years, when everyone else is using bitcoin then the US will allow it again.  Maybe

lol we don't have it "mapped out" at all.  There are huge disagreements about economics...mainly of them around "basic assumptions".  I'm not saying which one is right or wrong, but economics is far from newtonian physics as far as being universally agreed on
I would strongly challenge your idea that everyone would hoard with a deflationary currency. All deflation does is change the cost dynamics of hoarding, but I believe the market would even that out via priceing.  Right now the bar for investment, in an overly simplistic case, is anything about the real inflation rate.  I fail to see why that would change if there is no inflation (or deflation).  If bitcoins earn about 2% a year because of the growth in GDP (higher GDP divided amoungst same number of btc means each btc is worth more simply by hoarding), then that his the new bar for investment.  It doesn't mean that ALL investment will dry up.  It just means that a someone who needs money will have to satisfactoryly show investor that they will earn more than 2%/year (ie faster than GDP growth/btc price growth).
Lets play it out.  BTC is the world currency and each btc grows in value by 2% per year (rate of GDP growth).  A new company called Facetwitter comes out and is growing revenue at 100% year year, but they need more capital.  I am perfectly willing to lend them my btc because i can safely assume my ROI on that investment will be higher than just holding BTC.   Deflationary currencies don't change this fact...it just changes the breakeven slightly
basically...lending doesn't stop in a deflationary environment.  Look up the free banking era in US history. There were deflationary currencies, and the economy did just fine.

if fully adopted, then under a fixed universal currency the increase in value of each currency unit would be correlated to the overall economic growth.   Since the industrial revolution started 200+ years ago, economic growth has been about 2% real

the reason people put money into google is because they expected their long term return to be much higher than 2%.  That can involve a few years of low/no growth but eventually they want their money to compound, which is has (at a much higher rate than 2% no less) in all the above listed companies
it can be stock prices or any other asset.  Bonds, etc.  it doesn't matter. Any investment has an ROI on it and is compared to the universe of other available options. that wouldn't change with a deflationary currency.  It is all about opportunity cost.
all of it is really an expected value calculation with various RISK and REWARD levels. 
THERE was every reason to think google would grow quickly. IT wasn't a guarantee but the chance of success* reward of that success = a big payoff.

alright...i'm no where near technical enough to argue with peter todd...this vulnerability clearly exists now, bout would be easily fixable, no?
I can't see "tx1" but any merchant wallet could have a quick check and reject any transaction that had the vulnerable characteristics that tx1 has in the example above?  reject the transaction if customer has a tx similar to tx1?
there may be many vulnerabilities, but i don't agree with peter todd that we need to accept that they'll always exist.  Sure 1 or 2 merchants will get burned (again talking only $300 here at at time), but that will result in further checks to the smart wallet that the merchant has (it runs all these checks for possible double spends, waits 10 seconds and then purchases is complete)?
Is my thinking off?
edit: doing some more research it looks like my idea would work...in the link below, a merchants listening node would look to see how far the transaction has propagated after say 10 seconds.   If it only propagated to 20% of the network, then transaction would be flagged and customer would have to wait longer until propagation was 80% +.  Again these are easily fixable issues.  Sure some may get burned as we go through the growing stages, but each theft would add to this "smart wallet" that merchants would run.  It would ID most double spends over time.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:44:24
good discussion btw.
I would challenge the idea that deflation brought about the decline of those empires and the great depression.  We really have to differentiate between a steady deflation vs a rapid sudden deflation that is usually brought on by a proceeding extended period of rapid credit expansion (inflation) that is almost always brought on by a central bank or government action.  rapid anything is bad.  But just because german hyperinflation was bad, doesn't mean all inflation is bad...and at the same time, the "hyper" deflation of the great depression does make all deflation bad.   However that is an entire different discussion so i'll put that to the side for now.  (Niall Ferguson is great and Ascent of Money is on the top of my to read list.  I would also suggest for an alternate pro-deflation view, the book "The history of money and banking in the United States" by Murray Rothbard - a libertarian author.  Afterall this is essentially a keynes vs austrian debate we are having here ;)
For sake of argument, lets pretend we could magically go to a world were bitcoin was the universal currency..that there would be a steady 2% deflation rate every year (this corresponds to avg growth in GDP which has been fairly predictable overtime and would not change if bitcoin was the universal currency).  Correct me if i'm wrong, but in this world you would assume everything would be somewhat ok (bitcoin replaces world M2 = about $5M/btc)?  I think the real issue is HOW do we get to this magical world.  Obviously bitcoin would have to rapidly deflate in order to get there and you are saying that this would cause huge problems.  am in correct in that representation of your view?
The "getting there" will be tough.  there is naturally going to be a lot of volatility when something goes from 1K to 5M.  No doubt about it that volatility needs to come down (though argentinian dollar just lost 20% of its value in one day, and its still SOMEWHAT functional as a currency so i think some volatility is ok...though like you said, 400x increase in a year is too much).  It remains to be seen if volatility will come down.  I think at the beginning there is a: 1) a lot of volatility, 2) mainly investor speculation (no/little actual transactions).  Overtime, i would bet that as the more investors climb on board, the more the price will rise, the lower the volatility becomes and the therefore the more it is used as a currency.  Furthermore, if one country started using it as its national currency that would establish a floor for bitcoin to be fundamentally valued at (using size of economy and velocity of money you can calculate how much m1, m2 you need in the money supply).  If the country by country adoption rate was somewhat gradual, this could keep the deflation rate at a reasonable level.  I think the likely candidates for country adoption would be where existing currencies are already volatile like argentina or venezuela.  As they adopt it would become more stable and the middle tier countries could start to adopt, etc.  
It will def be an interesting economic experiment and i'm not guaranteeing that it will succeed, merely challenging the idea that it is guaranteed to fail

while i would never insider trade my own company.  It should not be made illegal.  It is on individual traders to decide whether they want to  deal with companies that try to take advantage of short term news cycles.  This brings me to the second point.  People who complain about insider trading are really people with short term horizons.  If you have a long term view, it shouldn't matter (though i would say i wouldn't invest in a company where management was so short term focused)
After, couldn't jeff bezos investments in amazon be considered "insider trading".  He knows the company better than anyone else, and could manipulate the price if he wanted to.  insider trading only referes to short term, yet the same principal holds for longer periods (say 5+ years).

I posted a while back in if anyone could prove outperformance in asset class over a 5 year period.  I got no solid answers.  One guy said he did, and then dropped off the face of the earth.  All these people doing TA need to understand the difference between luck and skill...especially in investing, where its hard to tell the difference.

thats also because the comparison to webvan is a complete crock of shit.  Webvan was founded in 1999 when there were close to 300M internet users.  Right now there are less than a million users that own $100 in bitcoins (Which is about the right comparison to getting an internet connection in the 90s).
We should be comparing bitcoin to the internet of 1990 (when there was about 1 million internet users world wide).  not 1999 like you are doing, and not 1995 like the original article above is doing.

i'd argue that you have no right to even a REAL wage increase.  I think it should adjust as your marginal utility increases or decreases.  
And as far as the govt guaranteed increase, this is exactly why government should be severly reduced/practically eliminated.   And even if it isn't there isn't such a thing a "guarantee" even from a govt.  Sometimes govt spending goes down and govt employment goes down. That isn't the worst thing in the world

Random Question: I saw in a recent video of yours that you said that volatility may not be a negative in terms of bitcoin becoming a unit of account, and that liquidity was much more important when becoming a unit of account.  
Could you expand on that idea?  It would seem to me that if to be a unit of account, something must be both stable and liquid?

i agree with your statement about investing for over a year, etc.  What i'm arguing is that your investment logic needs more than that in order to be sound.  Again, i could play roulette with money that i don't need for a year/can afford to lose.  that doesn't make it a good bet.
I'm arguing your investment logic needs to add in the fair value/margin of safety concept that i wrote earlier.  Without this logic we get into asinine scenarios that you posted originally.. ie debating when to sell despite the fact that bitcoin is still at a 90%+ discount to fair value.  If anything is at 90% discount, then you should buy hand over fist and never consider selling.  talking about selling when its at 95% vs 90% discount just seems crazy to me.  
Again, my main point, which i took out on you (perhaps unfairly) is to scold people for investing in things when they don't even have an idea of what that thing is worth.  Its the worst thing you can do in investing, and yet i see it from a majority of folks.

bitcoin is growing faster than the internet did (again i think the barriers to entry among the two are much more comparable than facebook/twitter).
I would argue free is very different than even a $5 move to bitcoin...and again, i don't consider someone with $5 total in btc to be a real user and certainly no comparable to having an internet connection in 1990.
$100+ in btc now would be more comparable to a www connection in 1990.   
by your logic, if user growth rate = eventual impact, then shouldn't facebook eventually be more useful than the entire internet? (a logical impossibility - assuming facebook is always tied to the internet ;)

nothing is 100% but you're being very selective on what examples your using.  Care to mention the many other bitcoin hackers who have yet to be found.  Sure some will get caught, but some won't. I would never evade taxes, but some will certainly try.  Do you disagree with this?  Do you further think the government is simply going to ignore the higher instances of attempted tax evasion?  More regulation is coming...that is my point
its not "meaningless".  what is easier to hide... a usb stick or $200M in paper currency.

a few things:
1) can we stop overplaying the remittance angle.  Sure its great, but if eveyrone instantly xfers out of bitcoin after remiting their $, then btc will be very low value.  At the end of the day, btc must be relatively high value in order to have a secure network and the only way that happens is by a fair amt of people holding btc for the long term (and not just swithcing from dollars to --&gt;  btc then back to say --&gt; euros. )  in the reminstance only setup, you woud only hold bitcoin for a fraction of a second. That would mean very low value of btc and low security = btc death.  99% of bitcoin is about it being a NEW currency, and that means holding for longer than just a xfer payment

right so think of it as...you gained by other people not gaining as much as they prob would have it bitcoin never existed.  But doesn't mean that those other people necessraily lost in an aboslute sense
Furthermore, lets look as some numbers for a sense of magnitude.   The world GDP is $60T  per year.  the total money supply (best guess for bitcoins future value) is also about $60T, but is relatively fixed.   So if it took 20 years for mass adoption, we have $60T*20 = $1.2 Quadrillion in wealth created over that time period (in real terms).  
Bitcoin would still be at that $60T number so only about 60/1200= 5% of the wealth created.  Not going to be a huge factor 
@_date: 2014-02-12 23:05:31
i'm not doing this.  read murray rothbard, and other austrian economic thinkers on what they believe causes recessions(hint: preventing bankrupcties actually causes MORE bankruptcies/problems in the long term because you have removed all negative feedback...the current banking system is tails i win, heads i break even.  So of course banks are going to take risks.  If you let banks fail, the risk taking would go down very quickly). You don't have to agree with it, but i'm curious.. Why the fuck did you invest in bitcoin if you think that the government is perfectly capable of managing a currency on their own?  US dollars are quite easy to acquire for people like you with faith in the fed.
Again, this goes back to my early point.  Most have no clue on why bitcoin is actually a superior means of exchange/store of value...they just wnat to "trade" and make a quick buck.

it will become less concentrated as user adoption becomes more widespread.  and even if it doesn't, who the fuck cares.  it's no ones damn business if someone wants to hoard wealth.  It isn't the states job to redistribute wealth.  Let people donate privately. I'd rather have bill gates privately donate his money than have some government bureaucrat decide were to spend his tax money.
Furthermore, even if a currency is inflationary, that will be dwarfed for the next 20 years because of deflation caused by the increase in user base.  Furthermore, its really who do you want to penalize...spenders or savers.  I'm sick of the savers getting the shit end of the deal with inflationary currency (though i admit a 1 or 2% inflation rate in bitcoin wouldn't change my support of it at all...its just not that important either.  People need to stop talking about the differences between a 2% deflation rate vs a 2% inflation rate.  It doesn't fucking matter.  People will invent/spend/etc the same exact amount over the long term in either situation)
And as far as "supply and demand can adjust...".  Supply and demand will adjust the price under a deflationary currency exactly as you said.  It isn't like supply and demand suddenly goes out the window in a 2% deflationary currency.

the problem with the fed proping up these banks is that it encourages more reckless lending in the future because of the implicit government backing.  Failure is good in a market system.  If you prevent failure from happening you get people taking reckless bets like you saw in 2003-2008 (banks etc knew there was government backing so the downside was limited)
Look at the history of Money in the united states.  GDP/capita grew perfectly fine when there was no central bank.

Thats what i'm saying.  The reason for the high prices is 90% because of the REGULATIONS.  if there were no regulations, i would start an asset xfer company tomorrow and charge much lower rates than currently exist.  I can't do that because the cost of creating and maintaining such a company is too high.  Many of these regulations are in place to support the existing oligopoly (via campaign donations/promises).  We may be talking to the same point, but monopolies exist BECAUSE of regulation.  not the other way around.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:56:51
The CPI will decrease if the rate of economic growth outpaces the rate of growth of currency units in circulation.  If the US dollar is inflating at 10%/year but GDP grows at 20% per year, then each dollar will become more valuable over time (deflation).  People will hoard according to you in the situation and the economy will fall off the cliff, right?  Each dollar will be worth more in the future so why spend anything?  
Of course i don't agree with this view and what your missing is the opportunity cost of delaying purchases.  Sure, i can buy a computer in a year from now that will be 2x per fast per dollar spent.  But there is a real value to having a computer for a year. It is an opportunity cost.  Deflation changes the numbers/break even purchase price, but it doesn't automatically rule out the purchase all together at any price.  Price corrects for everything.
In summary, its not the inflation/deflation rate of a currency that matters, but the deflation rate in relation to the growth in the economy.  There is no universal law that says in order for economic growth to occur we must have inflation (ie curruncy units in circulation grow =&gt; growth in economy).  Just because we've had inflation since 1913 and no one can remember otherwise, it doesn't mean that alternatives would suddenly lead to an economic apocalypse
So show that i'm not completely one sided...I will say i think the biggest issue with bitcoin becoming a world currency is the volatility that naturally must occur on the way there...as adoption rates go up.  As i've stated before, mild deflation/inflation is fine for an economy as long as its stable and predictable.  Bitcoin is going through wild periods huge inflation and deflation (to be expected b/c adoption growth is so high).  I think these swings will reduce over time, but whether they can become stable enough for people to use as a medium of exchange remains to be seen

for the record...I think with the internet...the unit of account issue is less of a problem for competing currencies than in the past (where auto updating based on exchange rate was much more cumbersome).  If we could get price tags to update automatically etc that that would be helpful for physical purchases (internet makes unit updating to current exchange rate easier).  
What we need to avoid is having a merchant change the prices for each of their items based on a fluctuating market rate.  For a while the dollar will be the yardstick to measure by (ie unit of account).  Maybe eventually bitcoin may be a unit of account, but i'd be curious to see how people think that will play out exactly

the "post 1913 = deflation" was a typo.  However if you read my entire argument you would see it as such (i clearly am under no illusion that there has been deflation since the feds existence...any true libertarian would never truly confuse the two) 
What i'm saying is that if you look at the gdp/capita graph, and split the graph into two parts: 1) pre 1913, and the other 2)post 1913, then the graphs will be exactly the same (growth rate from 1800-1913 is = post 1913 growth rate
in part 1, there was deflation (1800-1913)...in part 2 there was inflation (post 1913).   In both cases economic growth was the same.  Therefor i am disproving you original claim that no one will spend (ie no economic growth) under a deflationary currency.  We've had a deflation currency in the 1800s and grew just fine.

If 1 million people have less than $20 in bitcoin, are they really users?  No exact right answer, but see the thread.   Owning $5 in bitcoin now, is not equivalent imo to having an internet connection in 1990.  Owing $100+ in bitcoin now is prob more equivalent to a 1990 internet connection
@_date: 2014-07-15 20:26:54
by your logic the internet in 1987 was doomed to failure too because it drew much less funding than bitcoin has (and by 1987 the internet was laready at least a decade old).  So bitcoin has drawn more funding in a sooner time frame than did the internet.

not for a very long time.  Total world wide wealth is about 250Trillion or about 11M per coin.  
Assuming inflation continues at 3% per year, that would mean it would take til about 60-80 years, and that assumes all world wide wealth is converated to bitcoin. in reality, the best case is about 25% of world wide wealth.

well then fucking back it up with some figures instead of just "common knowledge" bullshit.  You cant just make a claim and use "common knowledge" as your backup.  I provided figures.  Provide a counter example.  
My main point is that the austrian school advocates for a smaller amount of larger recessions (ie get the pain out of the way quickly) while keynes argues for more frequent but smaller recessions (slow bleed).  Therefore you can't just say "oh look the recessions have been less severe" without counting the number of recessions
and i'll again reiterate this is all a side show bullshit distraction...again what matters is GDP/capita growth...which you have conveniently not addressed at all
@_date: 2014-10-16 17:48:09
is the crux of your argument that if technology costs don't deflate as quickly as the block reward then it will lead to centralization?
why not increase the block size to 10mb now? would that really eliminate home users from acting as full nodes now? would it price them out of it and lead to centralization?
Then by the time we are filling up 10mb, we can judge and see where we are at with transaction volume etc. 
Seems to me that while we have decent consensus amoung miners, we should increase the blocksize to a level that won't crowd out the home users from relaying transactions.

bitcoin has a higher fee because it doesn't rely on a single point of trust.  If you value that, then pay the fee and use bitcoin.  If you don't, then continue using dollars
I agree...if you completely trusted someone to run a currency, then the overhead costs of mining equipment etc seem like a waste.  Me personally...there's not one person on this earth i would trust to run a currency..so i don't view the mining equipment as wasteful.

the free market will eventually decide what the cost of transactions will be.  The end game for price/transaction is a what the network sees as a balance between 1) sufficient network security (high enough cost that a 51% attack is sufficiently expensive) and 2) low cost/transaction
If you want to minimize cost, you could make transaction cost very low (the floor would be what the actual costs are for sending/receiving at say 10K transactions per second...in a decade this should very very low as hard drive costs decrease, and internet speeds increase).  However, if you just charged the bare operating cost, then it would be easier to spend a lot of money and gain control of 51% of the network. Obviously you can't have it be on the other end...Very very expensive, or else the advantages of low cost that bitcoin has will disappear.  Balance will be key.

cool, thanks for the comments.  makes more sense to me now.  Sounds like a good scenario and hope it works out that way. At the end of the day we need to have 1-3% of total market cap going back to miners every year.  Whether thats via pure charity, like 21inc hopes to do, or inflation/block rewards...either is fine with me.  At the end of the day you kinda need to 'trick" the average consumer by hiding the costs of the securing the network.  You can do that via inflation, or socialized mining like 21 inc is planning

1)At first its "oh this is cool..i know nothing about it, but let me put in $100 and see what happens".  
2)Then when that $100 turns into $1000 its "shit...i gotta read everything i can about this"

I said "no transaction will occur at any price" because when you said "banks would simply stop lending" which is essentially the same thing.  Lending does not stop.  Just the price points change.  This change in price points can lead to more or less lending volume, but it never just stops as you said.  The same point holds true for other purchases.  Deflation (and inflation i might add) simply change the price points.  They don't stop lending/transactions from occurring all together (govt imposed price floors/ceilings are the only thing that stop lending/buying...because the break even price point is outlawed by the govt).
You essentially spouting off the standard keynesian argument of more stimulus during a recession while i'm talking about the austrian approach (lets prices fall until a break even point occurs.  Recession and depression are a needed remedy to a previous excess).  I would like to clarify that the economy can do quite well under either system (i'm not a rapid anti keynesian, but all else being equal, i'd rather not have keynesian policies)
Again, this comes back to my main point.  Let prices correct in a recession.  Recessions would be a lot shorter, and there would be less moral hazard if you let price drops continue to their natural conclusion instead of proping up bad decisions on the part of investors/consumers by pumping in more money into the economy.  Losing money is a healthy and needed part of economic activity. When you shower an economy with money in bad times you are promoting the unhealthy high levels of lending that proceeded the depression.
As a practical point, i would say, why in the world was the economy more stable when there wasn't a central bank than when there was (see 19th century)?  Certainly this should at least make you question you assumption that a central bank is a major part of any successful economy.

2) its also not that good as a low cost medium of exchange.  Credit cards charge maybe 2-3% but i can get 1.5% cash back so the true cost isn't that high for credit cards.

eventually, everyone will be using smart wallets that check for double spending.  with these smart wallets, we can have very secure transactions only having to wait 10 seconds or so.  Just have to check for other double spends.  If none, after about 10 seconds, then your original transaction will have propagated to enough of the network to make double spending effectively impossible/impractical for most sub $1000 purchases.

We have to at least admit that peopel who live paycheck to paycheck need a stable unit of account in their currency.  Bitcoin is a long way from that.   I think it will be fine, but there are legitimate reasons why bitcoin isn't  great currency at the moment.

but in theory they should keep both coins for a few years until its clear which chain will win?  
Lets say they track chain A, and fork A is winning for a year or two.  But then after 2 years chain B ends up winning out and chain A goes to zero.  I would hope that the trust would still have value and begin at somepoint to switch to tracking chain B price???

normally when we talk about inflation, that implies each unit of currency (in this case one bitcoin) buys less and less widgets over time.  
If you have some other nonstandard definition of inflation then fine, but don't be surprised when people call you on it
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:38:15
money is fundamentally about total units created divided by number of money in the system.  
if we have a system of 100 widgets created, with 100 tokens to represent money...then 1/10 of a token buys 1/10 of a widget.  1/100 of a token buys 1/100 of a widget.  NO INFLATION

problem is that $2.9 per tx makes many/most transactions not feasible.  how much of that 20K tps is simple purchases ike a coffee with cash today?  A LOT
at $2.9 per you basically remove all transactions that are under say $20, and you encourage people to make large bulk purchases of their products
think, instead of buying a $5 book on amazon, i'd hvae to wait until i hae say 20 books in my shopping cart, and buy them all at the same time in one transaction for $100.   i dont like that scenario and think its unrealistic for the average consumer

@_date: 2014-04-03 15:15:06
thats interesting, and i don't know how it turns out.  but tripling the user base would also mean a tripling of the price at a minimum (some have shown that the price increases 140 times for every 100x increase in users, so volatility might be even higher).
If you look at the patterns, we are increasing user growth about 8-10x every year with a corresponding 10x increase in price every year since 2009.   But that hasn't been steading. We've seen 70% price drops etc.   Not sure how it plays out but i'm not sure steady user growth rate = steady price increases.  Its likely to be more boom and bust in the short term, with a long term upward trend
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:34:12
what does current bitcoin growth compare to cell phone and internet usage?  look at the chart below.  The yellow highlighted cells show that bitcoin is growing about as fast as the internet at this point in its lifecycle, and bit faster than cell phone adoption. 
You'll also notice that the 5 year growth rate after the highlighted yellow cells are about 50% per year.  that happens to be the annualized growth rate in btc non-zero (ie active) addresses for the months of Oct, Nov and Dec 2014.  we are right on track ;)

fair enough.  I think thats a decent argument and definitely possible.  My numbers showing even a few hundred billion $ to mount 51% attack don't account for logistics etc.  Maybe mounting a 51% attack would be like building a nuclear device now.  A decent amount of poeple have the technical skills, but it invovles a lot of equipment etc that is tough to get.  If someone nation was found to be building a done of ASICS, and buying a lot of silicon etc, then maybe other nations could stop it?  its an interesting idea, and i'm definitely not 100% sure in my answer
At the end of the day, even with socialized security that 21inc talks about, it still has to be about revenue.  If my device is losing a few $'s a month in electricity, why would i run it?  even worse, why run it if the battery life is negatively affected

for all those who really want to know about delevering..i suggest ray dalio's paper, particularly the UK situation after world war 2.
Tldr, UK took its debt WAY down without major currency collapse, etc.  and the UK public debt at the time was close to 250% of GDP...much higher than the current US debt, and about the same as Japan's current public debt (though japan has about 600% debt to gdp when accounting for private debt, where as the UK only had about 400% in the late 1940s).
we shall see what happens, but i'm skeptical of the bitcoiners who claim with 100% certainty that a collapse is coming and that the US is screwed.
im all for free banking and such.  but i'm not sure we are going to get it...at least to the level some of our hoping.  i hope i'm wrong

now we are getting into a good discussion on what is a user of bitcoin?  if i own .01 btc am i user? i have a few friends like that.  i don't consider them users.  like minds can disagree on what the cutoff number is.  In reality the term "user" as it relates to bitoin will be a spectrum for while. With peopel gradually converting more and more of teh net worth to btc over a few decades.
for the record you could also have these arguments about whatapp.  I've seen huge growth numbers, something like 450M users.  how many of those use it everyday? once a month? once a year?   are those real users?
i have plenty of whatsapp friends who "last appeared" over 8 months ago.  Are they users?  i don't think so...at least not in a practical sense.

Its funny, everyone talks about bitcoin bubbles etc, but user growth itself is kinda consistent.  Much like the internet, I think bitcoin will grow at a steady 50% a year or so, and not at the big 10000% for 1 year moves, etc.   User growth remarkably consistent (measured by nonzero wallets over time).  People just get confused by the price moves

what if we looked at the correlation of the bitcoin market cap to the google trends score from pre Jan 2013 data?
using google trends for the term "bitcoin", i again ran a LINEAR regression, and the fit was pretty good.  much better than an exponential fit. 
the basic formula --&gt; btc market cap in $ = google trend score * 15,000,000
right now, the google trend score is 22,  in 2012 it was around 5 and in 2011 it was 1

i think thats a fair point.  after talking more with i think its very likely that someone who wanted to spend anywhere from $120M to 2T to get 51% of the network would cause problems only for a short while
still...there should be contingency plans in place etc.  Like a temporary white hat list of miners who could take over the network for a short while if a entity ever did get 51%

@_date: 2015-05-20 14:41:23
I ran some numbers assuming all transactions in the world werer through bitcoin and found that once the block reward is gone in 2040, that transaction fees alone will NOT be result in a very secure network at all (ie cost of 51% attack is only $30-100 Billion)
Proof of Stake or a constant inflation model (ie remove the 21 million hard cap) may be needed to fix the problem.

there is no guarantee the 40000% increase will continue.  Thats what it did in the past, but there is a lot of disagreement on what the return is going forward.  If there was no disagreement on the "fair value" of bitcoin, and everyone thought is was 400x todays prices, don't you think the price would rise?  So there is no guarantee that EVERYONE sees a higher btc value as inevitable.  I happen to think it WILL have a higher value in the future (lets say 100K/coin) so i hoard. I've never sold a coin.  Yet its clear that other people (see those selling coins now) don't agree with me.  Thats fine, but it shows that people have different opporutnity cost calculations.  Furthermore, my own opportunity cost calculation would change as the price rises.  My bar for investing in other companies is high now b/c btc is the best available alternative in my opinion.  But as btc rises, the bar gets lower.  Its not like i'd hold btc forever even if it was worth 100k per coin.  At 100K per coin i'd be looking for higher ROI opportunities such as investing in the next googles and facebook (because i would view the low future prospects for btc as less attractive than what the next google/facebook was offering).  That would mean loaning them btc because i think that the new google can compound money faster than the future price rise of btc 
People have to judge what the return on bitcoin will be vs the return on investing in a company like reddit/google, etc.  In the medium term that is a difficult calculation to make, b/c as you said bitcoin could rise or fall a lot.  But people have different judgements on where bitcoin will be.   Some think it wont get to 10K/coin and therefore spend the coins now.  By your logic, nobody should ever spend any bitcoins because the returns are so much more than anywhere else.  And yet in the real world people are spending bitcoins.  Maybe not in high amounts, but by definition as bitcoin value rises, the opportunity cost of hoarding gets higher, and therefore more btc spending should happen as the value rises to its ultimate fair value.  We could say that fair value is where bitcoin is the only currency in the world and the the price of btc increase by the same rate as world GDP growth (which is about 2%).
and a deflationary currency wouldn't make it more difficult to obtain capital. Can you point to me one company that says to potential investors "we will give you an ROI of below the treasury yield". No one does this.  You start a company because you want to have an ROI of more than what Tbills are returning...otherwise you'd just invest in tbills.  the same thing happens with bitcoin.   What matters is the REAL interest rate (which remains unchanged, even in a deflationary currency).  for all investments it is the ROI-inflation = real return that matters.  Now how many companies have you heard of make an investor pitch that says their real rate of return will be negative?
again neither inflation or deflation are inherintely evil.  What you want is a low inflation/deflation number that is consistent and predictable.  When inflation/deflation is sudden/unpredictable/unstable that is where you get problems.  
If deflation is really the end of the world how did society function for 1000s of years on mental currencies that had 0% inflation rates for many years (yes i know that gold inflates slightly every year but there have been decade long stretches in history where the inflation of gold and therefore the money supply was negative (due to lost gold etc and low new discovery rates).  Society did fine with that. Loans were still made. New companies were formed.

Not sure if anyone is still following this, but this comment will address using "unique addresses used per day" as a main variable for predicting the future bitcoin market cap (as opposed to active addresses as i used in the body of this post).   "unique addresses used per day" data is found here:
so, i'm not going to list out all the math (PM if you want the exact numbers), but my date range was from 7/1/2010 to 1/1/2013 (again, i exclude data after that with the idea that willy bot skewed the numbers).  the verdict, is that my predicted bitcoin market cap for 7/1/2014 was about $700B (or double the predicted market cap i got using active addresses)
**interesting data point, though in the big scheme of things, not too much of a difference  Active addresses called for $35/bitcoin and unique addresses used per day called for $55/bitcoin**
Gun to my head i'd still prefer active addresses as it seems less volatile.  Long term holders may simply still be holding..that wouldn't show up in the Unique addresses per day data.
I'm also beginning to attempt to control active addresses a bit better.  Right now this mainly involves removing dust addresses.  So far the % of active dust addresses as a percent of total active addresses has remained relatively constant...but monitoring this ratio should prevent some forms of manipulation in the active address data point going forward.  I'm also maintaining a database of point in time snap shots buckets of active addresses (ie, how many active addresses with balance between 1-10....balance between 10-100, 100-1000, 100+, etc etc).  again, the hope is that this will allow us to spot obvious attempts at manipulating this number.
My database also tracks coinbase users, blockchain.info users, subscribers to r/bitcoin, and bitcointalk.org users.   Hopefully a long term manipulation of one or two of these metrics will be easily spotted when comparing to the growth rate of the other metrics.
edit: point of clarification...The fit using unique addresses per day was LINEAR (active address fit was also linear).  I tried running an EXPONENTIAL fit to the unique address per day data.  For the pre jan2013 data, the fit was slightly better using the exponential fit, however when extrapolated after 1/1/2013, the numbers started to get completely unrealistic (as we saw with metcalfs law and reeds law in my other comments in this thread).  For example, using an exponential fit, the predicted market cap for 1/1/2014 was over $5 trillion.  yes, 5 TRILLION dollars

this is my thinking.  I with Gavin, in that in a practical sense its not worth worrying about...it will be 15 years down the line if there's a problem.  That said, it seems like a lot of people just say "lets wait and see".  Whats the harm in discussing reasonable outcomes?  
I've yet to here someone run the numbers and show how even if all tx in the world were bitcoin only...show how we have a secure network.  My estimate of all tx in the world, at 6 cents a tx, --&gt;only $31B to mount 51% attack. 
Maybe things will change, but that $31B needs to be at least an order or magnitude bigger, and prob more like 2 orders of magnitude (ie cost of 51% attack is around 1-3 Trillion Dollars...especially if we are talking about THE global currency/ledger)

Worldwide wealth is $250T (including houses etc).

@_date: 2015-01-22 18:50:36
i think the logic scales though.
security (ie cost of 51% attack) should scale up as more and more of the worlds wealth is put into bitcoin
if bitcoin is .01% of the worlds economy it needs to be less secure than if its 100%.  logic still applies, and the ratios work out as well too.
less % of world economy, = less tx's = less security.  Still prob need inflation no matter how popular bitcoin gets imo

inflation in the 1800s was basically 0 ($1 in 1800 is worth $2 in 1900).  Inflation in the 1900s was about 3% per year ($1 in 1900 is worth $20 in 2000).
GDP meanwhile (a good proxy for wealth and overall economic health), increased at the same rate throughout the 1800s as in the 1900s. 
There is very little relationship between inflation and true economic growth over the long term IMO.

Best case scenario, view bitcoin as replacing some sort of current currency.
For some terms below, see money supply, M0, m1, m2,etc at:
Scenario 1 - I've read that the world wide blackmarket is about 20% world wide GDP.   being that the total M0 money supply in the world is about 6 trillion $ (equivalant), then maybe bitcoins, in total could be worth 20% of that, or 1.2 trillion (about a 12000x increase per bitcoin from current prices)
Scenario 2 - for the other extreme, lets say all national currencies are replaced by bitcoin (not going to happen, but this is the absolute best scenario).  Total m0 supply of money in the world is 6 trillion, so bitcoins would be worth 6 trillion $ (equivalant, or a 60000x price increase from today)
if you assume it replaces m1, then the numbers go higher.  These numbers are not very realistic, or likely to happen, but are interesting to think about IMO.  For bitcoin to really be of any value, at least a portion of the above scenarios has to become a reality.  I'm sure i'm making some bad assumptions, but i think its generally accurate
Edit: another interesting example is comparing total market value of gold to total market value of bitcoin.  Total market value of gold has ranged from about 2-3 trillion (in 2000) to 10 trillion today.

if you look at the history of financial products, particularly those that are unregulated, schemes like this, as well as similiar price flucuations have occured throughout history.  Anyone looking for the Bitcoin to USD ratio to stay the same (especially over such a short time period as a few weeks/months), probably should reconsider their investment.
My prediction:  There will be a bunch of acts the people claim as "wrong" that effect bitcoin over the next few years.  We can all claim they are wrong, and indeed they might be.  But that won't keep the price any more stable
btw, pirate40 is clearly running a scheme here.  People will lose their money eventually, if they haven't already, whether or not he pays them this week or not...he will default eventually.  claiming 1 or 2% interest daily is impossible.  This scheme is for people who don't know how to do math.

bitcoin is my longshot bet in my retirement acct.  All the gold in the world is worth $10 Trillion.  Bitcoins in total are worth anywhere from 160M - 300M at present values.

Transactions per day has grown by 60% annually over the last two years.   At that rate we will reach VISA transaction volume in 17 years (ie 4000 transactions per second).   That is plenty quick for me

yeah it wa more just a quick and dirty rough calculation. but with the cost column, you can see that the entire multi- petabyte blockchain in the 2030s should be able to be stored on an off the shelf, &lt;$100 hard drive, and a normal say $30-$80/month internet connnection.
Combine that with the huge implied user growht, and i'd guess we will easily have at least 50,000 full nodes running by the 2030s..likely even 500,000 or close to a million full nodes by then.  Again this makes the huge assumption that user growth will be there...it may or may not be
but the point is, that IF the user growth is there, i doubt that the huge expense of running a full node will be a problem

some   All transactions in the world (cash, credit card, everthing) equates to about 20K tx per second...and I don't think that number is growing annually very quickly.
That said, here is some more realistic numbers and how they would relate to the blockchain...my max tx per second was 60K, so well beyond todays version of an all btc world.  And it looks like the protocol/hardwear should be fine.   All the growth rates i assumed in the following table are averages of actual bitcoin growth over the last few years
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:39:23

@_date: 2015-02-12 18:08:14
that article is misleading to say the least.  The 2.85M tpm was a peak burst.  There's no way that is sustained.  Furthermore, espeically for online sites like that there's no need for an insanely quick confirm time.  Doesn't matter if alibaba confirms tx in 1 block or 5 blocks from now.  They aren't shipping your product in the next hour
If you looked at total transactions, including cash etc, around the world, it would be about 20,000 transactions per second.  My table is very conservative and goes up to 60,000 transactions per second.  so again, we should be fine.   The whole "Bitcoin barely handles 3 tps" on is a dishonest critique
For the record, 2.85M tx per minute = 48K tx per second...again well under my 60K tps number listed in the table
edit:  for busy times of the year, where the blockchain is getting full (say mid day in china) then i think some sort of variable fee system wil lcome into place.  At mid day (china time), say 3 weeks before xmas, the blocks may be full..so you woul dhave to pay a higher fee to get them confirmed at that time (ie in person purchases).  However alibaba would simply pay a lower fee, and have them confirmed that same night when there is more space in the blockchain b/c of lower point in time tx volume.  Again this is if we get right to the limit.  Its actually likely that tech growth rate will outgrow tx growth rate, and we'll never have this problem

i don't think its really big enough to deter people.....i can run it on a very cheap computer.  The big thing with full nodes is that they should be running full time and usually need a dedicated computer.  Once you have that, most very cheap computers can handle being a full node
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:15:14
yeah i just don't get the current scare about cost to run a full node.  I've run calcs that look at the historical 5 year increase in transaction rate, the historical reduction in cost of internet bandwidth, HD space, etc and they all seem to line up.  By my clacs, even a world currency, with 20K tx per second, in say 2035 or so, would result in a blockchain size of about 2-3 petabytes...  A HD of that size should cost less than $100 in 2035, and by 2035, you should be able to download 2-3 petabytes of data in about a day or two.
People can say "well what if bitcoin grows quicker than that".  Thats somewhat valid, but i just don't see it.  we aren't getting a world currency by 2020...thats just not how growth rates work.  Furthermore, the bitcoin user growth rate, tx rate, etc have all been remarkably constant over the last 5 years...all around 40-80% annually.  A very quick rate, but no where near quick enough to get world wide use by 2020.  50% annually, works out to about  a few billion users by the early 2030s...but not much sooner.

if you remvoe the blocksize limit all together, then you don't need to "scale bitcoin" at all really.  A new verification algo would have to be developed, but there are already algos that could potentially handle 1 million tx per second, which is 86Billion tx per day.   at 13x increase in that number gets us to 1 trillion tx per day. 
At that point ,i think internet bandwidth and hd storage costs would be the limiting factor.  
blockchain pruning however, might reduce these costs and it would reduce the size of storage that full nodes need at least 90%. 
either way we have a long ways to go before we get there.   Tx growth is pretty constant, increasing about 50-100% per year.  We won't get to the trillion tx per day number til at least 2035...and prob never.   
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:39:14

A bit off topic, but i've also noticed espeically lately where folks will use "science" or "scientist" as one big group as if they all agree, and that if you disagree with someone, they'll point you to "well x of y scientists disagree with you so you must be anti-science"

@_date: 2015-02-23 18:33:42
here's at least how i think about it (I could def be wrong)....if bitcoin were to fail it seems like it would sour so many of the hard core crypto guys that i have a tough time seeing an alt coin suceeding or taking over.  its almost like its bitcoin or nothing imo for crypto's in general
if there is an obviously better protocol, i have to imagine, bitcoin would just adopt that protocol...i mean leaving $3B in losses to current holders just doesn't seem likely when a simple protocol change would do the trick.  though this is probably harder than it sounds
i happen to thin we will eventually need a substantial protocol change regarding the block reward, but thats a decade off.  By then there may be better consesus algos  who knows

if you include all world wide transactions (cc, cash, etc all combined) it works out to about 20k tx per second. I was conservative and made the table go up to 60K tps

I largely agree with that, but what about the scenario i outline below?  Its entirely plausible (likely??) that transaction fees alone will not secure the network and that eventually some sort of permanent 1-4% inflation will be needed:

i ran the math of future costs to run a full node.  They aren't as bad as you'd think
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:45:19
you're correct and that is an important point.  gavin recently talked about processors that are optimized to verify higher transaction volumes, etc?
If not, you're right we'd have to have some sort of trust b/c most would end up only downloading a pruned version of the blockchain.  I believe gavin himself said yesterday at the devconf that he believed the blockchain should't be stored long term by everyone and that it should mainly be a transaction system.
hard to say, but i believe there are systems being delevoped the could verify at over 200K tps.  That would still not be enough if tx volume was 60k tps, but i think we'll find ways around it.
im not a tech expert, but would an optimized chipbe able to handle a ton more tps. I mean 200K tps verifications still seeems slow when you think about how a modern day intel chip can handle 188 BILLION insturctions per second.  this will increase over time, and hopefully the gap between verifications per second and instructions per second will also go down, which could allow for verification of a multi-petabyte blockchain in a few days.  if you confirm my logic is at least somehwat possible, then i can run some more calculations assuming higher verifications per second rates
@_date: 2015-02-13 04:44:35
b/c in practice most transaction don't really even need to be confirmed that quickly.  Block chain propogation analysis will remove 99% of double spend attempts...of which i'm fairly confident you've never experienced...Hence the reason why i presumed that you've never actually had to wait for 6 confirmations etc...apologies if i assumed you wrong.  If you're one of the rare use cases that has been adversely affected...then fear not...better implementations of satoshi's snack machine should make physically waiting for blockchain confirms irrelevant for all but the largest of purchases
@_date: 2015-02-27 16:35:50
I think it WILL scale fine.   
Some are worried that if we untrottled bitcoin and basically let a lot more tx per block, that the cost of running a full node will be too expensive and this will lead to centralization 
My table, using reasonable assumptions, shows that centralization prob won't happen and that cost to run a node should be fairly constant over the next few decades
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:33:26
i'd wait...my fair value calculator has it under $100 right now.  It may never dip that though, but i think it will still be at around 200-300 in a few years...might as well wait and see if it goes below 100...if not buy at 250 in 2018 or so

I track this sort of thing across multiple wallet balances.  Its small but growing at about 50% annually.  Here's a historical breakdown that someone on bitcointalk created which is quite good:

for some things like proof of existence at a certain point in time, the entire blockchain would be useful
@_date: 2015-02-27 07:20:37
inflation is largely irrelevant as internet, storage costs, etc are all growing at 40-60% per year and inflation is less than 4%...technological improvements are what matters over 10-30 year time frame.
furthermore, i think blockchain syncing etc will get more and more efficient with pruning etc, so that ulitimately it really will come down to the raw internet speed, storage cost, and tx verifications/second.  IMO those will be the three main factors...
and again, i'm assuming very insane user growth over the next 10-30 years...thats far from a given outcome...my main point is that I doubt technological issues will be the the problem
as far as how realistic my numbers are...i have assumed (i the linked graph above) the same rate of growth that we've seen over the 2009-2015 period.   i track these figures monthly and user count, tx count etc all seem to be growing at about 40-100% per year when you remove the willy bot induced price spikes.  thats plenty quick for me

@_date: 2015-02-23 19:10:52
and if it did "fail" it seems that at least some would restart bitcoin (with a new consesus algo) using the existing blockchain
say someone got 51% of the network... and it goes down for a month or so.
wouldn't necessarily mean bitcoin is dead.  The community could go back to a mutually agreed on point in time before the attack, and restart the blocchain from that point using a new algo (PoS or something similar) that blocks the attacker from gaining 51% again.   this would be one worst case scenario

@_date: 2015-02-12 20:29:37
so i'm updating the original chart to address 's valid concern about how long it takes to VERIFY the blockchain, not just download.  I will run 5 tables based on 5 different assumptions based on **today's** max verification limit: 1) current max verifications = 4,000 verifications per second 2) 8,000 vps 3) 20,000 vps 4) 200,000 vps and finally 5) 1,000,000 vps
the only part of the table that changes with these assumptions is the highlighted orange column and corresponding orange cell
1) 4,000 vps --&gt; 
2) 8,000 vps --&gt; 
3) 20,000 vps --&gt; 
4) 200,000 vps --&gt; 
5) 1,000,000 vps --&gt; 
**tldr;** in the worst case, assuming huge transction growth (good problem to have), we are looknig at around 2 months to verify the blockchain in the mid 2030's.  Much more realistically it will prob take at most about  10-20 days at its worst in the mid 2030's.  Important to note that this metric "days to verify entire B-Chain" PEAKS in the 2030s and then goes down after that.  So if it is a problem, it will only be a problem for a few years

Extend this to the current user base and you can arrive at an approximate fair value.

In theory you're correct, but my point is that scientists too are suspetible to pervise incentives and the wnating to be with the in group to.
I'll just say it...b/c its the example every is thinking. BUt climate change.  There's this whole idea, which is prob true if you took a survey, that 99% of scientists are sure climate change is happening (though magnitude matters).  I tend to agree with Freeman Dyson on this, and admit that we just don't know.  Am I and Freemon Dyson anti-science?  or is there a chance that the evidence is murky?, espeically not about whether SOME climate change is happening (it is), but more about the magnitude (i don't think its as doomsday as many scientists believe, and their projections have a much bigger error bar than i think they want to admit to)

you're correct my calculation was off.   
the general point still stands.  If bitcoin really becomes popular, the cost of storage for the entire blockchain will be substantial and probably out of reach for the private individual user.  I dont think thats necessarily a problem, just something to think about.  trimming the blockchain, electrum etc will help with all this imo

I see your point on coins being issued by the state, but that still ignores the fact that hides, fur etc were all mediums of exchange in the past...many times without a major government overseeing/backing it.
You may not need a central authority to enforce contracts as well.  Especially for small value items, a reputation based system might work fine.  Like buying on ebay, etc, sure there may be some guarantee, but in general the user rating is a key metric for sellers.  It is not beneficial for a seller to renig on his agreement with a buyer.

your answer to 1 is really what we need to be pushing merchants for.   lets work on sass acceptance of bitcoin as a MEANS OF PAYMENT before we start insisting that merchants hold their bitcoins for long periods of time.   if merchants don't want to experience the volatility risk, we should allow a system that lets them experience the other benefits of bitcoin without the volatility risk.  Coinbase is a great solution to this.

This is naturally going to get somewhat political...fair warning
"Greatest growth in that period because it was industrializing"
-We are still industrializing at the same rate...GDP/capita has grown at the same rate in the 1800s (no central bank/gold standard/low inflation) as in the 1900's (with Federal reserve/high inflation/etc) (source 1 below).  Furthermore, there have been more panics in the 1900s than the 1800 (source 2 below).  Its may not be exact cause and affect, but the idea that society will collapse or even grow at a slower rate if it runs on a deflationary currency has not been proven in my mind.  
"I have someone named "Every Economist In The World" who would like to disagree"
Milton friedman said this in regards to a gold standard: "Friedman believed that if the money supply was to be centrally controlled (as by the Federal Reserve) that the preferable way to do it would be with a mechanical system that would keep the quantity of money increasing at a steady rate. However, instead of government involvement at all, he was open to a "real," non-government, gold standard where money is produced by the private market: "A real gold standard is thoroughly consistent with [classical] liberal principles and I, for one, am entirely in favor of measures promoting its development."
I would agree, in a perfect world some crypotcurrency with a 1% inflation rate would be ideal.  I know a few of them exist.  But i think its too late for them, as bitcoin has a huge network affect going for it.  Furthermore, a deflationary asset can be good not as a currency but as a STORE of value (cash equivalnts, etc).  Furthermore even with a 1% inflating crytocurrency, you still have massive DEFLATION as it moved toward mass adoption, ie the same massive price instability that you criticize bitcoin for.
For the store of value calculation, the fact that bitcoin is deflationary actually may help.  If rich folks want a secure, anonymous place to store their wealth, then bitcoin can be that (much easier to store than gold, easier to xfer, etc, so has some tangible benifits over other stores of value).  All the wealth in the world is $240 Trillion, entire worldwide offshore accounts is $10 Trillion, all Gold in the world is about $8 Trillion.  So there may be room to grow on that front for bitcoin.
Bitcoin really is a big experiment testing whether basic austrian and libertarian principles can work on a large scale (hopefully it scales up).
In closing, one of the best rebutles to the "bitcoin is deflationary..everyone wil hoard and no one will spend" is from this reddit a few day ago.
Here it is:
"Why would anyone buy a product today with a deflating currency that will be worth more tomorrow?"
"Why would anyone sell their products today for an inflating currency that will be worth less tomorrow?"

what i love about bitcoin is that all these "protection" laws such as price fixing laws, etc.  will be a completely irrelevant to bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-02-07 17:58:12
Have you heard of Gold?  for all practical purposes, gold is not backed by many/significant major governments, and yet still is worth about $10 Trillion world wide.
At the end of the day, bitcoin is a medium of exchange.   If two or more parties agree, then anything can be a medium of exchange...seashells, rocks, anything
Bitcoin has some practical advantages over seashells and rocks...it is easy to xfer (electronically) and near impossible to duplicate

There is still the delaying of gratification.  Just b/c holding coins earns me a 2 -3% a year (the deflation rate), that doesn't necessarily mean that no one will ever convert bitcoins into something useful.  Maybe the rate at whcih they spend bitcoins will be lower (than if it was an inflating currency) but i'm not sure it is doomed to failure b/c it has minor deflation rate.
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:32:18
In my opinion it is 1) figure out the fundamental value of bitcoin.  
2)buy when it is lower than that, and sell when it approaches your fundamental value.
If you do this, you don't really need to worry about selling out before a crash, etc.

its almost as if the author thinks the US didn't function before the creation of the federal reserve.
We did fine in this country on the gold standard (in inelastic money supply).  In fact long term GDP per capita grew slightly faster in the 1800's than 1900s (though in reality, the GDP growth has been very close to 2% annually since 1800.  Furthermore, there is little evidence that stock market fluctuations have been reduced b/c of the federal reserve.
The most important thing long term is that you have an open, free society with a good set of laws that are enforced.  Good property rights, etc.  The federal reserve has little effect on long term GDP growth
I don't think GDP growth will be affected by bitcoin (even if mass adopted). But to say that the gold standard or bitcoin standard would led to mass panics above and beyond what we've seen with the federal reserve is well...stretching

Those people only would make money if others buy into the hype.  This a completely free market solution and I'm all for whatever "price fixing" or any other "strategy" people want to employ
Yuo will never get burned, if you first 1) determine a fundamental value for bitcoin (expected value, adjusting for Probability of Success) 2) buy if the price is below that fundamental value (with a satisfactory margin of safety
If people want to form cartels, etc...fine let them.  We will finally be able to see that monopolies arent' bad (they are rarely stable and eventually the market removes all monopolies).  For those who disagree, bitcoin is great because even if you thinks wrong to form pricing cartels/manipulate the market...there's really nothing the public can do to prevent it

i think this discussion will quickly denegrate into more philosophy than practical economics, but to be picky...you are atleast one human who values the hammer as valuable - therefore the point stands that "everything relies somehwat on other humans using it".  In theory, if hammers were only used to hit people on the head, but no one wanted to hit anyone else on the head, then the hammer would be worthless
but in a practical sense:  imagine a world where everyone uses bitcoins to trade things. bitcoins for houses, etc.  There wouldn't be a root fundamental value, but your trust that everyone will use bitcoins would be so strong that you'd assign a value to them. Kinda like US dollar bills.  There is very little useful utility to be gotten from pieces of paper with dead people printed on them.  But the use comes from the fact that you are pretty sure that tomorrow, you could trade that piece of paper for some food, etc
good discussion, btw
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:02:25
You're basically stating some of the common criticisms of a deflating currency and why many view mild inflation as a good thing.  Mild inflation of 1% or 2% a year means your dollars will be worth less over time, and so their is an incentive to spend, which in turn creates a real economic benfit.
Most argue that a deflationary currency does the opposite, causing people to hoard their currency because they expect it to be worth less in the future...this in turn brings down spending which has a real affect on the economy.
In my mind, that may happen, but the market forces will always drive it back to an equilibrium point.  I think as more mercants come online the market price will obviously rise, but not everyone will hoard.  People say its easy to hold, but lets see what happens when the price hits $10K.  How many people here are really going to hold instead of cashing out and buyinga  brand new car.
People will always want products.  A deflationary currency wont change that over the long term.  In addition, as the currency approaches maturation, the deflation rate will go down.

i'd argue there's a problem with that because even most actively managed funds fail to get the performance needed to make that 2% worth it.   And 2% is very high for a fund that probably requires 20min a week to adminster like this one.
it should be compared to other index funds, where the management fee is .15%

Why would a super wealthy person put a vast majority of their wealth into bitcoins if it doesn't earn them much of a return?  Meaning when bitcoin becomes mass adopted, a lot of the returns we've been seeing will go down a lot to maybe 2-3% per year (b/c bitcoin supply is fixed, but GDP (World) is growing at 2-3% per year so each bitcoin in turn earns 3% per year).

Why would it be bad?  If a certain % of the population wants to deal in only colored coins, then that is their choice and they should be free to do so. 
If a different percent of the population is in favor of uncolored coins, then they can do that as well.  lets have the market decide what the premium or discount will be for colored vs uncolored coins
in effect coloring coins, would just be another form of currency.  It seems like most people use the argument here that "hey lets have some competition in the currency industry.  why does the dollar always have to have a monopoly?  lets introduce bitcoin for some competitition".  I see no reason why bitcoin couldn't be further divided up into "colored" and "uncolored" coins (in effect mini competition within the larger bitcoin family)
@_date: 2013-10-15 21:27:21
how could they prove it???
Its on the intent to remove coins from the original wallet that is suspect.  The receiver could just say "i don't know who sent them, they just ended up in my wallet". 
You'd have to be careful about not having other incriminating evidence like emails, etc, but thats what i like about bitcoin, you can always claim ignorance..
another good example...lets say the govt suddenly says its illegal for any us citizen to own bitcoin (like they did with gold in the 30's), and beyond that they've somehow proven that a given wallet id belongs to me.  I admit...ok, its my wallet but i forgot the password.  What can they do about it? Not much...I either hold out until bitcoin is legalized again, or transact out stuff when i'm out of the country

1800s inflation was essentially 0.  GDP grew fine (in fact at the exact same annual rate as the 1900s (which had 3% annual inflation)

Going to try and avoid getting too political here, but some of it is necessary.
I would strongly argue against the statement that "the gold Standard created numerous panics..."
Here is a listing of all finacial panis since 1618:
I really don't see a clear trend here. Obviously there are a lot more variables here than whether or not we had an inflationary or deflationary currency, but many supporters of central banks and policy intervention seem to assume it as gospel that central banks create more stability.  I'm not so sure.  As as you mentioned, the history of the 1800s shows that GDP/capita can grow at equal rates both under an inflationary/centrall controlled currenecy (US dollars since 1913) and under a deflationary currency (gold/bitcoin)
I would agree with you in general about the problem of price swings.  For now (as you mentioned) anyone who doesn't want the price swings, can almost instantly xfer coins to dollar to minimize the risk of holding bitcoins.  Eventually as/if bitcoin grows, the price movements will become more stable.
I think we will have a mix of your scenarios a) and b) with the balance going over to scenario a) as time passes.  What we want to avoid is sudden shits to a) and ideally have a nice gradual predictable shift to a).  That may or may not happen, but i agree...big price swings will slow the adoption rate of bitcoin IMO

The best investor in the world says determine the fundamental price of an asset, then look at the market price.  If market price is substainly less, then buy.  Buy and hold til you die and you can become fairly rich this way with only a few investments in your lifetime.
trying to time the peak etc, doesn't work and you'll get burned eventually if you don't have the fundamental value anchor.

I think he's trying to draw a parallel.  Certainly some may think "i'll just wait a year to buy a better computer for the same price" but most people just end up buying the computer and $/performance improvement hasn't doomed computers
Not sure if the same can be said for a deflating currency like bitcoin, but does deflation automatically doom the currency or just mean that loans have be carry a higher interest rate in order to compensate for the deflation

what your thoughts another currency getting successful.  Will bitcoin be subject to the network effect and essentially have one major player (which i can only assume would be bitcoin) or will there be other players in this shared space.
A concern i've had is bitcoins ability to handle visa like transaction volume (10K transactions/second).  I've superficially read that it will eventually be able to handle it, and that especially for small amouts, some workarounds can be implemented (don't have to download the whole blockchain etc).

even at $1k the market is unbelievably small.  A single billionaire can move the market and prevent crashes.  Think of richard branson having a buy limit in for thousands of coins if the price hits 700, 600 etc.  That in itself prevents crashes, at least at this point in the game.

now without ever connecting the cold computer to the internet, i go to spend my coins out of the cold wallet (actual sending is done via the blockchain.info site on a seperate hot computer) and somehow the "bitcoin network" knows that my private key is correct. How does it know its correct if the wallet/private key generation was done offline the entire time? thanks!  Whats to prevent blockchain from accepting and "signing" a private key of "123"

People should be doing an expected value calculation on this.  You have to account for the 1)chance of success and 2)reward if that success is acheived
We know  is about 20%...The reward is if bitcoin became a major assett maybe on par with gold ($10T market cap).  
So bitcoin market cap should be 20% * $10T = $2,000,000,000,000 (risk adjusted) or about 1000x more valuable than todays price ($100,000 per coin)

i think having one company being able to control the production of their own coins (what's to stop them from inflating the currency?) would make if fundamentally less valuable than a decentralized currency like bitcoin.

why does visa's transaction size in bytes matter?  I was simply comparing VOLUME of transactions in Visa vs Bitcoin.
If bitcoin is used for all purchases instead of visa, then the byte size would still be 300 for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:15:43
for reference i believe Visa does 10,000 transactions per second, so that 1 TB hard drive would contain about 1 days worth of transactions.
Point still stands that most people wont need to download the full blockchain.  Ease of use etc will go down as internet speeds grow and as HD space gets less expensive (while size per transaction remains constant)

Your link inspired me.  Lets get a little crazy here and use the growth numbers listed in the above article (i know growth from 2012 to 2013 is hardly a trend, but it'll be a fun exercise).
2012 bitcoin economy = $28M
2013 bitcoin economy (conservative) = $63M
using this growth rates, we have the bitcoin economy (corresponding $/coin in parentheses):
2015 Size of bitcoin economy = $318M ($2.17/coin)
2020 Size of bitcoin economy = $18B ($125/coin)
2025 Size of bitcoin economy = $1T ($7,214/coin)
2030 Size of bitcoin economy = $61T ($416,031/coin)
*for reference i assume: Value of 1 Coin = Size of Economy / [(Velocity of money - I assume a value of 7 here) * 21,000,000 coins in total]

Right now merchants have the option of almost instantly converting any bitcoin transaction back into $, thus minimzing the risk from holding a volatile currency.
The other benefits of bitcoin will hopefully push merchants to accept bitcoin even if they have to instantly (and effortlessly i might addd) convert back to $.  This simple rise in transcations conducted in bitcoin should push the value of bitcoin higher.  As the bitcoin market cap increases, the stablity will increase as well.  Overtime, merchants may slowly be willing to hold bitcoins for slightly longer (instead of instantly holding in cash).  As a result of this, bitcoin will go even higher and become more stable.
The author of this article is thinking of 100% one side or the other.  That is not reality.  Merchants and Consumers have options of going X% in bitcoin, Y% in $.  Overtime, its my hope and belief that X will increase, and Y will decrease.  As long as there aren't any sudden shifts (slow and steady) i see no reason why bitcoin can't succeed.

One more question
Here is my scenario:
1) download bitaddress.org (FROM github)
2) xfer downloaded .zip file from hot computer to cold computer (via usb)
3)unzip the bitaddress file
4) generate wallet/private key from the zip file on the cold computer
now without ever connecting the cold computer to the internet, i go to spend my coins out of the cold wallet (actual sending is done via the blockchain.info site on a seperate hot computer) and somehow the "bitcoin network" knows that my private key is correct.  How does it know its correct if the wallet/private key generation was done offline the entire time?  thanks!

is there anyway to transfer decent sums of money at less than .1%?  Bitcoin is the only one i'm aware of and is one of the main advantages imo
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:12:37
ok, got it.  
As to your question, of who decides what somehting needs, its my understanding that bitcoin network needs 51% approval for any changes.  Either way, i still dont' understand why the 10000 transactions per second X 300 bytes/transaction is the relavant calculation for blockchain size.  The other data can be done off blockchain.

do you know if blockchain.info does in fact make "the change address the same as the address you are sending from"
here is my scenario, lets say i have 5 coins in an address that i generated via bitaddress.org (lets called in wallet ABC).  To test it send 2 coins to a new wallet XYZ via the blockchain.info website (entering private key for ABC on the blockchain website, under the send feature).  It looks like my original bitaddress.org wallet (ABC) decremened by the 2 coins and now ABC has a balance of 3 coins, XYZ has a balance of 2 coins.  When check my balance on the blockchain.info for the ABC it says there are 3 coins.  Are you saying my coins in fact are not still there in wallet ABC, but instead in some other change address?

So i want to create a paper wallet.  On a hot computer, i download the bitaddress.org (from github to be safe), put that file on usb disk...take usb disk and put it into a cold computer that never touches the internet.  On the cold computer i install the bitaddress.org file from the usb stick
I now generate a paper wallet. 
Question: if i do nothing else, is this paper wallet live? How does the "bitcoin system" know that that wallet address is valid (since i created it on a computer that never has or never will touch the internet)?  if i transfer coins into this newly created wallet, will it work? will the coins be lost? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 05:28:56

everything fluctuates in relation to everything else.  The line between asset and currency really is arbitrary when you dig deep enough.
In my mind, bitcoin is interesting b/c it is an UNDERVALUED asset/currency.  you really need to link all this stuff to the fundamentals of the value provided to the counterparty.  Right now, it takes a few thousdand bitcoins to buy a house.   With the fundamentals of bitcoin, i believe that is a lopsided trade (bitcoin being undervalued in relation to houses).  That is why i'm buying
In any investment, you should determine the value of the security independent of what the market values it at.  If you self determined value is significantly above the current market price..with a sufficient margin of safety, then buying a group of securities with the same characteristics should yield satisfactory return over the long term

I believe coinbase also allows you to cancel the order any time up until friday, so if the price rises above what your comfortable with, you could always just cancel the order before it fills
double check this though...i'm not 100% sure

ok, thanks!
Just to clarify, a wallet has 30 characters (or whatever it is).  There are obviously Trillions and trillions of all possible unique wallet ids (when accounting for upper/lowercase letters and then numbers).  Are you saying that NOT ALL of these trillions and trillions of wallet id combos are valid?  If not all are valid, approx what % of the combos are valid?

fair enough.  Same thing with gold.  no real inherenet return, only the return from a fixed supply in a world that is growing in terms of GDP
Store of wealth is interesting, and something i hadn't thought of before for bitcoin (I was calculating only as a currency and means of exchange (velocity of money, money supply calcs, etc)
Thanks for introducing me to the idea!

First off...that article is great.  This is how bitcoin will be valued  longterm (about 1/7 the total value of goods traded in bitcoin per year).
But i think at this point, people are saying "The 116 million in goods traded per year, with bitcoin, will grow quite rapidly, thus justifying a higher price in bitcoin".
If the total value of goods traded with bitcoin will be closer to $1 Billion, then that would mean about a 210/coin price.  The market may just be anticipating that.  
Or its a bubble :)

A currency is something of value that is relatively easy to transact, but the "relatively easy to transact" part is a spectrum.  we could use houses as a "currency" but they are difficult to transact, therefor houses are more of a "Store of value".  The point being that at the end of the day, whether you are takling about a "currency" or "a store of value" all that really matters is what is this one thing worth in relation to everything else in the world.  My one house can get me X cars, or Y dollar bills, or Z computers.  
So nothing is really dependent, but everything is RELATED and valued in relation to everything else.   There is certainly a scenario (however unlikely) where bitcoin could be the only currency.  The world would function fine.  I could still buy a house, or a car, etc...I would just pay in bitcoins.  Therefor, I don't see it as written in stone that bitcoin is 100% dependent on other currencies.
Amazon was supurior to Sears brick and mordar stores.  However the gradual process didn't cause world panic etc.  The better option simply one out of the long term.  Why couldn't the same thing happen with currencies like bitcoin?
Taking off the bitcoin colored glasses, i think the process will be gradual.  It won't take over the world overnight.  It will start off as now, where a relatively small amont of dollars gets you 1 btc.  Over time, I believe it will take more and more dollars to get 1 btc.  Some of that depends on the value of bitcoin (utility, etc) and also the value of the dollar (are too many printed, excessive regulations, etc)

If your coins got stolen in the heist, then they are listed on hold.  Any new coins you buy since the heist, shouldn't be on hold.  Nor should you US dollars.  If they are, it is either a mistake or i'm guessing they flagged your account

i'm just curious at people who buy at 30 but don't think it will ever reach 150.  Why buy at 30? do you think bitcoin will stay at a sub 1Billion market cap (essentially 0% adoption rate).  
I mean most people seem to buy b/c they think it will be adopted on a semi large basis.  if you think that, i don't see how even at 150, bitcoin would be severly undervalued.

at the end of the day nothing has a fundamental value.  Everything relies somewhat on other humans using it.  Ignoring this technicality, my fundamental value calc is that it become a world wide currency on par with say gold, so fundamental value is in the 2-70T range.
I don't think he'd invest in bitcoin b/c the market cap is too small for him to invest (not worth his energy at this point), just like he won't invest a company with a $1B market cap.
I just think buffett is less of a purist on this stuff than he leads on.  Everything has a price, and for a low enough price he would buy a lot of things.  Again go back to my example of gold.  he always says he would never buy gold.   Yet i almost guarantee he would buy at $1 an oz (even if forced to also hold for 10 years).
He's bought silver in the past as well.
