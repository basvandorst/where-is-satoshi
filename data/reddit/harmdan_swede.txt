Honestly if it dropped to $100/coin i’d pick up a few for the first time.. hold it till it hits $20k again in 2025

that’s a big if

Is the volatility not a factor though?

I bought at $19.8, still hodling so you’re good!

holy shit it just broke through $6500

yeah calculation seems about right. I’d suggest you think of it this way -! a 1080 TI on nicehash today would yield about $77, minus electricity costs of say $14, yields a net profit of $63, or 350%.
The formula looks like this now
(77 - 14 = $63 profit)
I reckon the equilibrium point would be when profitability looks more like
(77 - 75 = $2 profit) due to increasing difficulty or
(14.50 - 14 = $0.50 profit) coin prices fall till profitability normalises
I call this the Arse Hypothesis, because that’s where I pulled this out from.. but it may be right 
Tdlr Arse pricing Model states that fair value of a coin = (electricity cost of a coin) x (1.03)

In countries where currency stability is an issue.. digital currencies make sense, as the x factor over fiat is being decentralised; censorship-proof. Venezuela for example. 
An ideal currency should possess these traits: General acceptability, portability, durability, divisibility, and stability of value
That last trait is where digital currencies fail at the moment - as coins surge in value, holders would choose not to spend them, as you may get more for your coin tomorrow than today. This deflationary trait reduces bitcoin from a currency to a store of value, like gold. Hence its price in fiat matters; because you’re using bitcoin to store fiat. 
The only stable digital currency - pardon my naïveté - appears to be USDT, and that’s saying a *lot* about the digital currency space today, that the safest coin is fundamentally no different from a Starbucks gift card or Prepaid Visa debit card on your iPhone’s wallet.

I’m waiting for the $1000 mark 
@_date: 2018-02-07 06:07:24
100% agreed.. too much controversy around tether right now. However one unintended side effect of that is tether being the most *visible* stablecoin right now.

*normal prices*
Based off the flood of used GPUs incoming.. Id say you could get a used GTX 1080 for $100 (TI for $150) with one year’s warranty left.. the used card market is gonna be a buyer’s *paradise*
Nvidia will probably hate that though

If anything it’s gonna increase difficulty. For eg say i’m running my cards at stock settings to limit power usage, and i was getting 0.1 BTC a day. Now that it’s down to 0.05 BTC a day I say screw it, i’m gonna OC al my cards to get 0.06 BTC/day before it drops to 0.01 BTC/day next month

The fair value of bitcoin (or any crypto for that matter) - is maybe 2-3% over the cost of mining. That’s it.
