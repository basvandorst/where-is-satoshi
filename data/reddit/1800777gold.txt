It is within the realm of possibility for all miners/nodes to collude and raise the coin limit.  Such is impossible in the case of gold, it cannot be created by humans in a cost efficient manner.  Keep in mind mining and creating are two separate activities.  Creating gold can only be done by stars, particle accelerators, and other nuclear devices, the latter two not being cost efficient, the former not being useful to humans without FTL technology.

Gold and iron are fundamentally different.  Bitcoin and x-coin are not.  Liquidity is man-made, and the transfer of said liquidity to another coin is also man made, and quite possible.  Man cannot change the properties of gold in a cost effective manner.  Iron is not scarce.  Iron is not tarnish-proof.  Iron is not visibly attractive.  Iron is used extensively in manufacturing.  All of these properties, and more, make iron an inferior store of value.

Gold, like Bitcoin, is near infinitely divisible.

It's quite unsettling that people need encouragement to not sell.

It's the only thing that makes sense.  Perhaps it could be worth a great deal one day, if people in high places have a vested interest in it becoming the norm.

He's right.

Yes, yes it does.  That's why the bond market exists.  If the yield on debt increases, the amount of money the holder of debt has to pay as interest increases.  If the interest on said debt increases beyond what can be paid in the allotted time, default results.

* Platinum is an industrial metal like iron, this diminishes its use as a currency.   Ideally currencies will have some outside or industrial demand, but not to the extent of platinum whereby industrial demand may influence its value.  Gold is unique in this respect.
* Platinum is not distinctive in color, appearing nearly identical to silver, palladium, aluminum, and other silvery metals
* Platinum was not independently adopted by the civilizations of the world as money

* Gold doesn't disappear after a coronal mass ejection.
* Gold is anonymous.  (Bitcoin is an Orwellian dream come true, the most traceable currency to ever exist.)
* Gold can't be cloned.  (Litecoin, Feathercoin, all alt-coins perform the same function.  If one network dies, another can be reborn, into infinity.  The mining based "security" of one network can be migrated to a new one.)
* Gold cannot currently be created by humans in a cost efficient manner.  (Events similar to the hypothetical asteroid mining of gold have occurred many times in world history, the discovery of the New World being a single example.  The currency survived, and has continued to do so for a minimum of 5000 years.)
* Gold can't be "hacked" by infinitely fallible and exploitable man-made devices.
* Gold isn't based on government created (NSA/NIST) cryptographic algorithms.  (A government that may or may not have the best interests of its citizens as a priority.)
* Gold isn't disabled by hurricanes.  (Katrina was a learning experience for many of us).

Hardly.  It's exactly what the establishment wants, the most traceable payment system ever created, with a large chunk of the coins held by a shadow figure.  An Orwellian dream come true.

According to Alan Greenspan, the above statement is incorrect.


I believe Alan Greenspan has more credibility and economic expertise than and will take Greenspan's statement as the correct one.

Does the auction interest rate follow the market's interest rate?
@_date: 2015-08-27 17:28:41
Gold only fails by measures of bankers who can't issue infinite credit using it.
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:53:24
The difference is governments now have such vast debt that any rate increase would cause default.  There will be a reset.  Some gold and a bitcoin or two may not be a bad strategy.
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:44:06
Ohhh I see, so what interest rate is given to brand new 10 yr notes?  That's what the auctions do right?

Peter Schiff, on his latest series of podcasts, said the Euro would not go below $1.10, and that $1220 was the bottom in gold.
It would literally take dozens upon dozens of hours to locate where in the podcasts he said this, but it's there in the first 30 episodes or so, I listened to all of them.
Of course, he was wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-31 19:47:33
If the market rate goes up, the auction rate will go up, and the interest on the debt won't be able to be paid, and default occurs.

Maybe the site has never outright stolen coins, but the customer service, like Bitstamp, has been shady and questionable for quite some time.

Avi Gilburt made much more impressive calls, coming within $10 of the high, and, like everyone else, buying the low.
I'm not incorrect, CPI is wrong.

Sad that Bitfinex is the most popular Bitcoin exchange, running on a hacked together, ruby-based, hand-me-down codebase based out of China.

I like his perspective and videos here but I don't think his calculation takes into account the incorrect CPI

Give it time, the IRS will be involved soon. Technology is not bitcoin's principle weakness, regulation is.


This is impossible to say with certainty.


Perhaps, unless governments/banks control the nodes/miners and have a differing agenda.


Perhaps.  Perhaps not.  This is not certain.


No, but I can guarantee gold will be fully functional, and worth something, *tomorrow* and in *one* *thousand* *years*.  The same can not be said of x-coin.


why, because *it's* *different* *this* *time?*
I get that storing currency in your brain is game changing.  I own bitcoins for this reason, and its properties that could lead it to become the next Orwellian nightmare. However ... bitcoin is not money ... is not a replacement for gold ... and never will be.

In my opinion gold is undervalued.  Claims per ounce at the COMEx hit an all time high 207 claims per physical ounce, along with other reasons.
