No you guys sent me twice to different addresses, that’s the thing
@_date: 2019-02-27 23:44:11
But why did you send those coins to me twice? 
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:45:34
Winter is coming!
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:22:25
Coin mixing?
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:49:46
I have a question, so basically I have a bot that is linked to that address, and my bot has sent a small amount of Bitcoin to someone else (I know who the guy is), so, therefore, did the attack turn onto him instead of me?
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:44:39
How can these attacks harm me?

Nah BCH is a shitcoin, nano is much better

Why did someone downvote this
@_date: 2019-01-23 18:10:19
Well I thought it may be good to deposit on a site doing wallet service and then withdraw to a new address
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:59:34
I'm a programmer, I use my own HD wallet :D.
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:48:37
Okay so what should I do
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:48:06
I’m paying 4 cent fee and get an instant confirmation :D
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:04:42
well they are already spent by my bot, sent to someone else, what can I do?
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:58:17
Predict with certainty, no, speculate according to the facts, yes, however if you only look at the price I wouldn’t recommend it for 2 reasons:
1. This is a highly emotional market, and therefore the price can either wreck you or make you insane gains, there is no middle.
2. Bitcoin is about the technology, and if you don’t know the technology and why it is solved so many problems so elegantly, then don’t get it. The fastest way you can lose money is buying into something that you don’t know and have no interest in learning about 
@_date: 2019-01-23 14:08:32
No I programmed that bot, and the coins are spent (and the left over is a new uxto to my address)
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:21:40
Well my bot bought something from someone else so the attacker will think I’m now the guy I sent to lol?
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:52:48
You are a dumb man who does ignore facts and no amount of Bitcoin can change that
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:53:06
I live near there and didn’t know ;(
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:12:21
[I don't think so](
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:25:58
Assuming this was not a joke (can't really understand if so, sorry), I did take this from Bitfinex, check yourself
@_date: 2018-04-17 09:53:37
The US takes heavy taxes but still has a HUGE 20T$+ debt
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:18:25
May I ask what is seen in the picture? I don’t really understand...
