You started and ended your previous comment by accusing something with no base and taking it as gospel, it's ad hominem.

Altough I congratulate you on the fact that you're donating to charity, I can't hope but to question the charities that you chose, right off the bat you started with universal healthcare, you know, a socialist idea that would require massive centralization of power and the monopoly of healthcare, damaging competition forever, there's also net neutrality, but that one's too controversial for me to even say which side I'm on without getting flooded with downvotes. But seriously, if your main goal with bitcoin was to get money, that's cool, I support it, but I expected someone that had this much btc to at least have the knowledge of the importance of less government control. Your money can do a lot, I'll just leave with some suggestions for charities, you could help the poor in your country, the mentally and phisically disabled, save the frogs foundation is a good one since they're really important to the echosystem and are on the risk of being extinct, that sort of stuff.

pick one
You can't make a change by voting, if 51% voted for a candidate then almost half of the population got their voices silenced. Even worse, I don't want any government deciding things for me and stealing my money, voting won't change that.

People simply know that acting unethically is wrong, that is regardless of government or lack there of, people know better, crime would occur regardless, maybe more or less frequently, but that's beside the point, the point is that the government in itself is an unethical entity that contradicts its own institution.
Voluntarism, Anarcho-Capitalism, Libertarianism or whatever you'd want to call it is a relatively new ideology, but has its roots far back in the Greek philosofers. The US was libertarian at some point but it still had a minor government.
However, the reason it hasn't been tried is simple, it's not easy to do so, politicians would never give up their jobs and they are at a position where they can even act against people that wish for that, it's a fight against the biggest monopoly there is, the monopoly of power and control.

Under the free market, everyone acting voluntarely with their freedom intact, people would respect the non-agression principle and act accordingly as a society, everything would be private, and economy based around competition, supply and demand without interference from the government.
