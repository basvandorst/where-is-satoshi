Maybe use caps next time.

Sry but I think there is little to no hope you will get your BTC back. No wallet, private key or acces to your email. Actually I think I have as much info on your BTC as you. None
@_date: 2018-09-15 13:19:12
Not so strange if everything was red first
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:15:21
Oh really
@_date: 2018-08-18 11:51:46
No shit sherlock
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:06:04
And then you lose your private key. Point is. No currency or crypto is risk free. Sell your dollars for BTC. But never forget this market is far from being optimal.

Another useless price prediction post
@_date: 2018-05-25 17:53:49
It will moon to 40k 50k or 200k. It will drop till 1k $500. What's ur point and goal. 100000 topics of price statements. I DON'T GIVE A FUCC! 
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:07:43
You are too late mining btc bro. That's for the big guys now with hundreds of mining rigs. Mine altcoins or just buy BTC
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:59:38
I'm drunk and about to take some xtc but even I think. WTF
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:00:00
I'm convinced now. Gonna sell my house right away
@_date: 2018-05-25 16:26:05
Best method is to hodl
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:16:43
He's a Blood. Why he cool with CRYPto
@_date: 2018-08-04 12:41:45
Everything else but bitcoin is are considered altcoins
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:04:40
Your missing the point here. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT PRICE WILL BE. Crypto isn't about price. It's about the technology. If u make money with it cool. I want that too. I'm just done with useless moon messages no one can proof. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:02:31
Sell and buy back at 8k
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:26:19
Complaining btc drops while your intention was to buy anyway. Okay
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:19:06
Amd then see it drop 8k again
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:05:01
Sure keep telling yourself. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:12:20
Pfff we going to see these posts everyday. We know by now. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:59:20
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:07:43
Bitcoin and stability. Lol
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:25:44
Gl with that
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:27:47
Lmao. It will never go below 5k. Oh and after that it will never go below 4k. No one knows what bottom will be
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:15:00
Then I recall my statement about that. I was misinformed. Let's hope he gets out quick and use his brain for good things. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:26:38
Holy crap. What's happening last 24 hours
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:55:34
No one knows. And if they claim they do know. They lying
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:41:31
Uhm do some research what the dark web really is. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:49:14
I like the change
@_date: 2018-07-21 12:44:08
Sure, he is innocent. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:00:55
Ulbricht was charged with money laundering, computer hacking, conspiracy to traffic narcotics,[26][30] and procuring murder.[27] The charge of procuring murder was removed from the indictment[31] although the evidence was factored into Ulbricht's.
Murder was removed, but dude alot of shady things are happening on that dark web. And yes child porn is part of that. I'm not accusing him of being a murderer or child abuser. I'm stating that people who are that could get in contact with each other and pay with bitcoin. And again his conviction is ridiculous. But he is not a Saint. Someone who is that smart to set up a dark web knows he is doing illegal things. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:44:24
Indeed. Laws put you in jail. Morality doesn't. I already stated his conviction is ridiculous. That's doesn't mean he deserves a punishment
@_date: 2018-07-21 11:49:41
Even tho his sentence is ridiculous, he knew he was doing illegal and dangerous things. Signed but he facilitated an underground clubhouse for drugsdealers, murderers and pedofiles. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:38:26
Wow guess you have to sell your house to eat
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:15:45
Isnt this always the case
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:15:00
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:18:46
They already sold when it went down 10%. You think anyone buying at 19k is a hodler
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:14:41
Why? It will go much lower
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:10:16
Lol what a shit post. You going to say the same thing when we reach 2k?
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:30:40
No one cares how much you bought. Keep it to yourself.oh and you bought too soon
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:09:19
What a bullshit
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:15:59
Then you're an idiot for not selling at 20k
