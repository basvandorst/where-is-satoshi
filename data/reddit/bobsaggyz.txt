With all that cash flow you don't have 5k on hand to throw at the dip. Why the loan? Message me in a year with the exact math so i can laugh again.

Going further down

Dont worry about the recent dip after you bought either.

Not a troll at all bud, way to avoid the Q and go off on speculation when you and I  both know you won't message me in a year. 
We both also know you won't send the math.

Buy and hold. This is a decent time, we are seeing a minor pump today but for the past weeks price has been dropping so don't be deterred.
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose either.

Dont spend more than you can afford to lose. 200$ in your country seems like a lot. Don't expect to be rich. Many of bitcoiners strategy is to hold or HODL because they have faith in bitcoin in the next 10 years and then some. Don't expect to be driving a lambo anytime soon but I'd still invest. Consider it a savings account you can't touch unless you absolutely need to

You don't. Not a single soul on this Earth can read the future.
