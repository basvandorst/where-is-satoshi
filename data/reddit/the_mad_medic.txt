Into Coinbase is rarely a problem.
USD out of Coinbase is the where the snags are.
That basically sums it up for crypto as a whole.

If it drops to anywhere near 300/coin, just buy.  Don't need to talk about mining.
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:18:25
Nobody really understands this shit right now.  I don't mean how the blockchain works.  Like really understand it and how it fits in the economy domestically and internationally.  You cannot replace fiat, that's how business is done now and for the next 50 years.  You got a big ass country with big ass guns with plenty of resource to protect the greenback.  What protects crypto currency? The people? Lol.  You can argue with the small points about getting fuct during the meltdown and it's one big conspiracy show etc but the US economy is still here and arguably doing ok as of today.  At the end of the day, you have countries working together creating large scale trade to keep the world economy moving.  With crypto, nobody really knows wtf they are doing and with such a tiny footprint in the global economy, the nerds still can't agree and get shit decided and implemented.  So understandably until the crypto folks get on the same page and show some progress and consensus and move this shit forward, the old men with white hair are largely going to ignore and discount it.

All miners globally that have anything over 0.06kwh rates could drop off the face of the earth and it would not put a meaningful dent in the total hash rate.  I think you completely underestimate how many industrial/institutional miners there are and the size of their farms.  If you're running a "farm", they are running a continent.  That's the scale...

They go with the flow of the market. If you are an oracle you can buy at whatever time best suits you. Unfortunately nobody can see the future so you can only guess. Welcome to a free market and capitalism at it's best.  You wanted a decentralized business model here it is. No price-fixing plenty of Market manipulation.  Ironic right?

Seriously, sell the dress for USD, send your USD to one of these crooked ass exchanges like Coinbase. They will take your money, lock your account and make you stress over lost funds. They'll never answer your support tickets.
Then your wife might divorce your ass and she'll need to buy a wedding dress again cuz she gonna get remarried.
Moral of the story, never listen to your wife about investments. And never giver your money to Coinbase.
All joking aside, please read up on the Reddit threads about the exchanges before you do any business with any of them.  So many people have signed up with accounts and sent them dollars before doing their research on feedback from other customers experiences.  There's money to be made in this space but there's probably more money to be lost in comparison, mostly because of ignorance.  Not trying to scare you off just reminding you that this kind of space requires extreme due diligence.  Good luck brother.

Got it working, was just my login password for the site.  Silly me.  Question for ya:  Do you only start getting payouts 18 days later?  So far been hashing for 4 hours but haven't see much.  Frankly I can't even tell where to go see what the 'earnings' are.  The payouts page only shows what's equavalent to 0.22USD, but I guess that's only because I've been hashing for a fraction of what others have been when the block was found?  Still very new to me but feels good hashing with 1 S9.  3 are sitting in their boxes next to me....this noise things going to be a problem.

That's great to hear...I was starting to get some buyer's remorse for a little bit.  Are you able to get over $35usd per day after pool fees and electricity per miner?
BTW, I checked out Kano pool a few days ago, couldn't figure out what to enter for my payment address password in the settings page.  Prohashing and others don't even ask for that field which is required in Kano.  Am I doing something wrong?

I still think it's real ahead to be looking at prices with 4, 5, 6 decimal places.  How would you go shopping for best deals? Imagine going to Target and looking for a sandwich bags...

Month to month or contract based?
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:28:29
Anyone that can Google can, so you should be able to also.
The point I'm trying to make is not that this tech has no value. But rather, saying this guy and that guy have no idea what they are talking about it that they don't see it, in itself, has no value. These guys invest in tech that they know will provide value and return to other investors. They invest, for their investors. If they cannot not be convinced, it only means that they know they will not be able to convince their stakeholders, and that is the key.  Big whales aren't big because they invest their own money, they're big because the BRING lots of other money. So the angle is not, YOU can't see this awesome investment, the angle is, WHY CAN'T I convince you this is a good investment so you in turn can convince your investors. And let's face it, in order for Bitcoin to fly, we need the majority of the people to lose faith in the USD. If the USD is stable, all u get are stablecoins... Which is crypto trying to piggyback on the all established dollar.
So in short: How are we going to convince the whales, that are balls deep in USD themselves, that this tech is going to make the financial system as they know it obsolete? That has always been the question.
By the way the 'these guys are dinosaurs that don't get the tech' is no different from saying there's only 1 way to skin a cat. U aren't convinced because you don't get it.
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:50:31
Can you list the number of times "great tech and good logic" failed as investments.
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:45:34
lol.  if your phone is offline, you don't lose your phone.
if your node is offline during a payment, you lose your payment.
you pay a centralized trusted 3rd party to 'watch' over your shit while you are offline.  Throw away trustless.  Throw away peer-to-peer.  This is no longer bitcoin.

It's a stepping stone to more centralization and it's anything but peer-to-peer.
That's all anybody has to know if they want to know if LN+BTC is bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:21:33
Lol you are a complete fucking idiot.  No wonder your country is fuct.  People like you are the problem with that nation... And no blockchain can fix it.  Judging from what's being going on, you guys will end up breaking blockchain.
You don't know any other alternatives, that much is obvious as day. Admit it.  BTW bitcoin and governance... You really are that stupid aren't you.
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:29:05
Scenario 1. sure works.
Scenario 2. sure also works.
Both scenarios, not optimal.  Are there better existing alternatives?  Go ahead....say no.
Keep in mind that this path was chosen was not because something was broken.  A certain group tried to force their ideology and methodology down the community's throat hence the split.  You only have to look at why LN exists in the first place to get what's really going on here.  The simply point is, you can do this kind of thing on-chain.  We don't have to debate which chain, lets just say any chain.
@_date: 2018-11-01 00:55:35
You have no idea of what's in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio do you.  Besides, smart people have smart people surrounding them to make them even more skillful. What you are talking about is a bet.. Arguably a bet against the established system. What investors talk about is a calculated investment in the proven.  You aren't even playing the same game so there's no point to talk about them as if they are remotely the same thing.
@_date: 2018-03-31 16:04:57
Yup that confirms it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:19:34
If Lightning is Bitcoin, then what is BTC?
You're 0-2 so far kid.  Google harder before replying.
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:04:34
So what you're saying is in this whole world and all is infinite possibilities, you can only think of 2 solutions...BTC relying on LN, or, Bitcoin Cash?  Sad...
(BTW, if you want people to take you seriously, call it by it's name.  Derogatory remarks like bcash only show what an ignorant, hypocritical, and intolerant person you are. Like your country's leader that's driving your nation into the toilet.  No blockchain can save you if that's the way you want to behave.)

@_date: 2018-03-31 08:58:12
I completely agree with you regarding your last sentence.
But this is not about blockchain or not blockchain.  This is about LN with all its drawbacks vs alternatives.
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:05:14

Lol they actually kept it simple. On both the back end and most importantly the front end.  And... They leveraged what existed out there already to create a successful business model.  They didn't try and reinvent the wheel in terms of technology just for the sake of avoiding something that want broke.

So it's blatantly obvious that being online or in-store is expected, i.e. retail purchase
Person A needs to send money to person B, i.e. simple peer to peer tx
You guys need to get on the same page.  There are more than 7 billion people on this earth.  The majority of them don't have internet connections.  Another large majority of them don't have reliable internet connections.
The problem with your theory is that you have no idea the current state of the world.  You think everybody is living in the developed world only dealing with 1st world issues and staying 'connected' is trivial.
You have no clue and you just proved it.
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:22:38
I can't wait to see what these guys will do next to make bitcoin even more complicated.
Watching them build a house of cards is entertaining I must admit.
@_date: 2018-03-31 08:14:34
Lightning and it's tradeoffs are not the best nor only solution for instant micro-transactions.  Your presumption that it is is pure ignorance.  If you had done your homework, you'd know this.
But let me be clear, LN has it's applications, on any chain.  But it's main strength is NOT the one you stated.  There are other solutions out there that are far simpler and with less/arguably no tradeoffs.
Finally, if you think being offline is a non-issue, then I simply have this to offer:  You have no real-life experience in  global mission-critical business systems and security of such systems.  At all.
