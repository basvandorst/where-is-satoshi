I don’t think so, if we’re talking about the halving, then supply is the independent variable that changes and affects the dependent variables: Price and demand

No no, the halving only affects supply. Which increases price. Which THEN could increase/decrease demand.

Here’s a simple graph, S is before halving, S1 is with decreased supply due to halving. This is assuming demand stays constant.. which will obviously not be the case.

Instant deposit to CB and then transfer the usd to CB Pro? I haven’t tried it, but I think I remember hearing that somewhere.

I think I deposited USD to CB from my bank account (not a wire transfer), purchased USDC from the USD funds that were deposited, and then continued on with the rest of the process.

Nah bro, so for example, I just tried it out:
300 purchase of USDC: no fee
Transfer USDC from CB to CB PRO: no fee
Purchase BTC instantly from CB PRO with USDC: fee = $0.75, which would’ve been $2.99 on CB.
Optional: transfer to CB wallet if u want: no fee

No, it should drive PRICE up, “in theory”.

Just want to let you know that, IMO, btc best use is to be used more as a store of value/relative scale for other currencies than as a currency itself.

The supply curve shifts left in this instance because it will decrease due to the halving affect on the mining reward. We’re also assuming no technological advances. Now just take this whole thread and trash it bc these assumptions mean nothing - moon
