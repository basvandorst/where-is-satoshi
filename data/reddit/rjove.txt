It's simply greed. Not in a bad way, but people like making money. Loaning btc out on an exchange is a good way to make it. Margin trading, not so much in the long run. But they still try.

Silly Kim. They were cheap at $200. Still overpriced to be opening my wallet for.

They should expect major lawsuits if this happens. Not everyone is that altruistic.

In the article he says he wouldn't recommend it to institutional clients. Those are big investors. 
Personally I've been spending my stash more aggressively all year, and sold out more as the price was blowing off around $700. 
I always hear "invest what you can afford to lose." I don't like this for two reasons: One, all money is money you can afford to lose. Two, once you are hooked you become emotional and start buying more at the wrong times. This is a problem as the average person will buy more aggressively on rising prices/good news. This is actually the worst time to buy. 
My friends always ask when to invest in Bitcoin. First I advise them to have a 401k or similar type of nest egg first. Second I tell them to wait until it goes on sale. This does not mean to buy every reaction from the top. Wait until they're really on sale. Last time this happened prices were $200. I was loading up and telling all my friends (who asked) to buy. None of them did.

BFXcoin sounds like a terrible idea. A market full of emotional gamblers trying to make up a loss? Sign me up!

I remember it clearly—December 2013, basically the top of the last bubble. The initial correction from the overbought top ($1100 to $500 in two weeks) scared a lot of green investors who bought at or near the all time highs. So somebody created a forum thread trying to get people to not sell and mashed HODL instead of HOLD while typing the title.
Those were emotional times where all bitcoiner holders were looking at huge paper gains. Some were overnight millionaires. But market reality can be very emotionally jarring for those who are new to it. As a result of that two-month run to $1100, the price proceeded to decline to $200 over the next year, slowly and painfully shaking out those who bought at high prices, or who tried to HODL or "average down" during this time.

Markets move in waves, never in a straight line. It's simply the bigger wave that determines which way the price goes. So corrections are inevitable. 
There are so-called "deal chasers" in every market. They are a class of investor who are less educated about finance and markets in general and driven to invest by emotion. They tend to think that a stock or commodity is a bargain if it has reacted a few points from its highs and buy accordingly. This strategy works well in a bull market (which has undoubtedly sucked them in) but begins to fail as the price reaches critical mass and cannot push higher. 
Most of the public is a member of this investor class and tend to be loaded up with stock at high prices right before a large crash. It's this transfer of ownership that prepares the bear market (like loading a spring), where the public will inevitably sell at a loss (again driven by emotion) when bad news comes out. It's unfortunate because among them are intelligent people who simply don't understand how the game is played.
OP is also right about liquidation of safe haven assets. When big fund managers see the writing on the wall a lot of money can get dislodged quickly everywhere.

Try this: On May 18th, a trader holding 30,000 contracts long was margin called when the market declined and hit $435. His account was force liquidated. That means he lost the 350btc he had on margin to be able to trade such a large position.

Traditional commodities, like coffee or soybeans, are valued in dollars or whatever currency is convenient for the trader. For instance, one NYMEX coffee futures contract is worth 37,500 pounds of coffee beans at price $x. Traders speculate on its future value by trading the contracts back and forth, therefore the value must be a currency. And yes, while you can technically take delivery on a swimming pool full of coffee beans, most don't—they sell the contracts back to the market before delivery date.

They are a paper contract, like a derivative, to be able to buy or sell the underlying commodity at a future date. When you trade futures, actual btc are not traded, only contracts. But the trader must have btc deposited with the exchange which is locked up while the trade is open. 
Edit: I should add that Okcoin values their futures contracts in dollars to have a relatively stable currency to peg them to.

Just to be clear, 20,475 *futures* contracts were liquidated trying to short Bitcoin. To trade 20,475 contracts does not require $2 million nor does it mean that you risk that much. 
At OKcoin, one futures contract is worth $100 of BTC. Most likely the trader was using 20x margin. This means you can buy up to 20 times the contacts for BTC you allocate to the position. So you allocate 1BTC as margin to essentially buy a 20BTC trading position. In this case, ((20,475*100)/477.28)/20 is the amount required to hold a position of that size and probably the amount he lost when he was margin called—about 260BTC. 
To put things in perspective, a 30,000 contract holder was margin called trying to go *long* on 5/18 at about $435. Apply the same formula and you see that trader lost nearly 350BTC. Brutal, yes, but not millions.
