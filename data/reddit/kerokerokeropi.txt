Why would anyone ever trust the rebranded site? If any other companies or investors wanted their exchange platform tech, which is the only thing potentially worth keeping around (but then again, is it?), they'd be better off buying the tech and avoiding any linkage in name or lineage to the original MtGox. 
All these leaks and "oops we telegraphed our intent with an html comment" seems like a disingenuous attempt to try to prop up the business under a new name. If they get rid of their CEO who's to say their CEO isn't the owner or part owner of the new CO.? Why would anyone want to trust anything that guy is associated with ever again? 
In my opinion anyone who trusts their money or virtual currency with a rebranded Gox is a complete moron who at this point deserves to have their money taken from them.

That is not Ponzi because those people are just buying something at an inflated price. If it were a Ponzi, there would have to be a lie in there somewhere, where an investor thinks they are getting a certain rate of return but in reality they are losing money. If they try to withdraw all their funds they find out that the bank statements that say they had $X amount in the fund were lies, and there really is no money (or a fraction of it) there to be withdrawn, or the Ponzi pays them with money from incoming investments. 
You are making the mistake of thinking a market where bitcoins, a commodity (or commodity like thing) are traded at market prices is a Ponzi. 
Just because people pay inflated prices doesn't mean it's a Ponzi. Just because the initial bitcoin holders are being paid by newcomers at high prices, doesn't make it a Ponzi. Both parties are agreeing to the trade price, so there's nothing Ponzi about it there. The buyers are extreme suckers for buying at the high prices, yes. Ponzi? No. 
T&gt;hat is also a correct definition, if the dump was done by the early owners.




Most of this is irrelevant. No one is making the argument that bitcoin is not a Ponzi just because it has a revolutionary idea or tech behind it. 
The argument you make would make mined diamonds a Ponzi. Or oil from the Middle East. A small number of parties hold most of the resource, and they make money selling it to the rest of the world at high prices. Even gold would fall under that definition, except we'd be currently in the late stages of the gold being distributed through the market. 
Who said the adopters were altruistic? I certainly don't think that. I think the ratio of people who are into bitcoin for purely idealistic principles is probably pretty tiny. Doesn't mean it's a Ponzi. 
Just accept that you got the definition of Ponzi wrong. You meant either scam, bubble, or pump-n-dump. I wouldn't argue with any of those three descriptors for what's happening in bitcoin right now.

There is no need for centralization. There will be a few bigger exchanges, a few medium sized ones, tons of smaller ones, and hopefully nothing as dominant as Gox. The prices and liquidity will stay in tune across virtually all the exchanges thanks to automated bots doing arbitrage.

I'm not actually worried about anything. I'm just trying to understand how moving into decimals would prevent deflation, in a hypothetical scenario where deflation was taking place. 
Supply decreasing, or losing coins is one type of deflation. Another definition is purchasing power increasing, which is the type that I'm curious about with regards to bitcoins. 
Just thinking outloud now, I'm not refuting what you are saying, I'm really just curious about it at this point: wouldn't BTC by definition deflate once the amount of BTC stops growing in 2040 (or whatever that date is), and the economies of the world continue to grow, or even if the world economies grow faster than BTC are generated? Wouldn't these lead to deflation?

They use a third party service to protect against DDoS. The main issues have been with their trading engine, which at the moment seems to be written to run against a single server, which is acting as the bottleneck. You can't easily fix a problem like that by moving to Amazon.

You can't outsource the design of scale-out architecture to Amazon. They provide the infrastructure, and it is up to you to design and architect your app to be able to scale out. That's what I'm saying. There are a lot of cases where it's hard to scale out, and using databases that can scale out more transparently (e.g., NoSQL ones like Cassandra), you run into issues where they start dropping support for consistency or transactions. 
I don't think self-hosting is the problem for them. I think the problem is the efficiency of their code and system design, primarily in the trade engine. Moving to Amazon isn't going to automatically solve their problem. I'm guessing they couldn't just plop their existing systems into Amazon and then add instances and have things scale, because their systems weren't designed for that. So for an app like theirs, they have the options of redesigning it to be able to scale out (which is not trivial), or scaling their existing hardware up. The latter option quickly runs into limits if you are using a cloud provider.

This is already addressed in the hackpad doc he linked to. Single server runs the main engine, but multiple servers can handle the API chatter in a scale-out fashion. The main server has to be singular in order to be able to run the orders in proper sequence.

Yeah I think of bitcoin more as a commodity than currency. I still think it provides utility as a form of online payment, or of transmitting money around the world. I'm not a fan of the credit card or debit card system as a way of doing payments, I think the banks make too much money from that, and the future I see for bitcoin is as a replacement for that. 
At the moment though it is almost 100% commodity, since there is very little real world use or value for it other than as speculative investment.

Wrong. A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment scheme where investors are paid "returns" from their own money or the money that other investors are putting in. Ponzi schemes claim fake returns and lie to investors about their balances. Investors see their fake financial statements from the Ponzi and think they are earning money year after year. Sometimes they might even withdraw some of it, and actually get money out. That gives the illusion credibility because they think they were able to get some money out, then the figures they see on the statements are real. 
The Ponzi sustains itself by bringing in new investment money, and that is where the payout to the investor who withdraws a little bit of money comes from. Sometimes a Ponzi actually does have a positive balance, but that real balance is much smaller than what they tell the investors is there. This can happen with hedge funds or other investment firms that start out 100% legit, but lose money and start lying to investors, hoping they'll be able to make that money back by working harder and smarter. That never happens, and it just spirals out of control until the amount that investors want to withdraw exceeds the amount that's actually there. Then it pops. Or until the law investigates them (often because their claimed rate of return are too good to be true according to statistical models). 
Bitcoin is not a Ponzi Scheme (PS) because it's just a tradeable thing. If someone is willing to pay $250 for a bitcoin, and someone is willing to sell a BTC to them for $250, that's a fair trade. There is nothing Ponzi about that exchange. 
The question is, what makes a person willing to pay any particular price for it? The belief that it will be worth more in the future. Where does that belief come from? Many places, herd mentality, publicity, a lot of that could originate from pump-n-dump activities. Certain exchanges or investment opportunities within the bitcoin community may be scams, even of the Ponzi variety, but bitcoin itself is not a PS. 
What you really probably mean to say is, pump-n-dump. Or just scam. But people who call it a Ponzi Scheme make themselves look like fools.

I think coffeescript is great, and much more readable than javascript. And for those who don't like javascript, it actually gets you to like it more.

I don't think their decision was worth it though.

When you say "If you fill 100.12 to 106.13 with 0.1 increments" does that mean you put in a bunch of 0.1 BTC buy orders to push the 100.12 - 106.13 ones down the list? And in this example which wall are yo pushing down, the 150K one on the buy side or the 11K sell side one?

What you are describing is a pyramid scheme, not a Ponzi. Bitcoin does share some properties of a pyramid scheme, I'll agree to that. In a Ponzi scheme there is one mastermind (or a small group) with access to all the funds from new investors, who distributes the funds. The distros don't necessarily have to be to old investors either. 
As far as SS, I don't know much about that. I do know that a lot of people don't know what they are talking about when talking about Social Security, even some politicians don't know how it works.

I think that will be up to the people who set up exchanges using buttercoin. Buttercoin project itself is just the open source engine, it won't set up an actual exchange. It will be up to people to set up buttercoin deployments, and do all the appropriate paperwork/registrations/filings with government agencies and banks to be able to operate legally. They will have to accept those costs.

Yeah, I'm reading the LMAX article now. Hopefully after I'm done I'll understand why node.js. 
EDIT: Finished reading it. As a language and framework js/node are well suited for LMAX style system. But I wonder how well it will perform compared to the Java implementation. I think V8 can actually be very fast. I don't know enough about javascript or V8 engine performance to form an opinion either way though. I wonder about the mem use too, and if the extra work to get good enough accuracy on financial calcs in javascript will have a significant negative impact.

If you have the know how, it's cheaper to run your own servers, and you can get much better performance per dollar. It's also not always easy to design a system where the bottlenecks (typically the database) can scale out by adding servers. Maybe some of the database as a service things might work, but last time I checked most of those scale-out db's have other limitations that you wouldn't want in an ordering system, such as limited or no support for transactions. 
If you were just serving a bunch of content and were getting high traffic EC2 would probably be a good idea. But when the bottleneck is in database transactions EC2 may or may not be a good idea.

Their track record certainly does nothing to refute what you say. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 16:42:30
You're right. The real reason is that it's a core feature of the LMAX architecture. 
In LMAX a single thread on a single machine performs the business logic (order matching), and all the app state is kept in memory. Any events that might change state are journaled to a durable store, and can be replayed to bring a new node up to speed in case of failover or reboot. You can also snapshot, and the events are repliated to other nodes in a cluster so that fail-over can happen. This means you aren't going to have an RDBMS with traditional transactions to manage the order book. 
Under this architecture serialization is enforced by the fact that there is a single thread performing the transactions. The speed of this design comes from the fact that there is is no overhead from concurrency (at least not in the core of the engine; anything not core to the business logic of order matching is done asynch, which is why I guess they chose node.js). 
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:06:17

Bitcoin will always be volatile until we have exchanges that can withstand DDOS, as well as big spikes in trading volume without going down or queuing orders.

The thing I don't get is, if people are crashing the market on purpose so they can buy coins up cheap, isn't there a pretty big risk that they will crash it hard enough that it will trigger a herd mentality such that the price goes way down and doesn't recover? Similar to when it crashed after hitting $33USD last year? How do they benefit from that? 
There is no guarantee that it will ever come back up to the current prices or anywhere near it, so if they buy them "cheap" and the price continues to fall, or never goes back up they are losing money right?
