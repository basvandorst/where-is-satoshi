If a country was going to adopt cryptocurrency, what incentive is there to use a current one, rather than starting their own blockchain from scratch?
Make a new Scotcoin, start the blockchain with the Government having a large initial number of coins, and away you go.

Why would anyone buy though, if they can't remove the BTC afterwards? Hope you'll be able to after the month is over?

What happens if the miners simply update to *signal* seqwit, but don't actually run it?

They can extort arbitrarily large transaction fees from you though, if you want to use your bitcoin.

This is a problem which is resolved in some other coins, eg Decred, where users issue pos votes on the blocks. So users could reject a pow block with no transactions while mempool was high.
As you say, there is no secure mechanism to do this in BTC, although you could have your node blacklist the block, that would result in a fragmented network and not be a good idea.

This is nothing to do with block size. The issue would occur at any sizes of blocks. Larger blocks cope with it better, as then there is more room so the odd empty block isn't an issue.

Normally it happens due to network issues.
You lose connectivity, or are under a DOS attack. You can have a failover node boot up and start giving work to the pool of miners, but it's mempool starts off empty.
The mining pool doesn't want to have all it's miners sitting idle while it waits for tx, so it just starts with an empty block.
It's not ill intent, just an issue with network connections.

Aha, thanks for that :)
I wonder if an adversary could create a large number of hostile nodes to manipulate the median time, and try to trick other nodes to reject blocks from other miners? You would manipulate your own blocks timestamps so they wouldn't be rejected.

A mining pool with a large number of malicious confederate nodes could presumably slowly try to nudge the clocks of nodes around rival mining pool to try to get them to stop accepting their blocks!
Nodes are cheap compared to hashpower, right?

I understand the basics of the hashing aspect of Bitcoin block chain, but the aspect I don't quite get is how it enforces the 10min block time.
I know the difficulty is adjusted every X blocks, and for a block to be valid it'll have to meet the new difficulty. But since blocks can be synced at any point in time, eg if I start running a new node, how does my node know if the timestamp of a block is correct or not? How does it know if the difficulty is therefore appropriate?
Could I start making blocks which claim to be far in the future, so the difficulty is really low since no blocks have been published for 10 years? Presumably there is something to stop that from happening.
Conversely, could I make the difficulty ramp up by issuing blocks in the past?

20 years ago my desktop had 500MB harddrive.
Now I have 2TB.
I really don't think in 20 years time that amount of storage will be an issue.

Bitfinx is giving people free BCC for shorting BTC.
They don't require the shorter to re-pay the BCC and BTC, just the BTC. So you borrow a load of BTC, short/long the position, and you get free BCC, basically. This means bitfinex is going to be paying under 1 BCC per BTC, using a coefficient to make it's books balance.

Isn't it the other way around? If you do run BIP-148 you are vulnerable to a split, as you are ignoring some blocks. If you don't run BIP-148 then you are a full node, as you are considering all chains as valid?
Could you elaborate some more? I'm probably missing something.
