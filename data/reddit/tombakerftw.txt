Such significance makes too much sense, but I agree I saw the word such and automatically started thinking in Comic Sans.
much conditioning

Sarcasm is all about tone, inflection and emphasis. It just doesn't translate well unless it's an extreme sarcasm.
Subtlety + Sarcasm + Internet = confusion

an absence of a state does not necessarily mean an absence of laws, it just means the absence of violent enforcement of those laws. We had laws before we had government to enforce them at the end of a sword/gun.
I've been back and forth on the whole statism v anarchy thing and I feel like neither side really considers that there could be a comfortable medium. It just bothers me when people imply that the current system is "good enough" or "not that bad" as if everyone else should just STFU and deal with it.
When people fear the government you have tyranny, when the government fears the people you have liberty.
Basically I can't really get behind a government that operates without a shred of accountability or transparency. That being said, I can't see how a power vacuum would help anyone but those willing to use violence and coercion to get their way.
If we could replace the current system with one where I have more of a say where my tax dollars go then maybe I could get on board.  (I'd rather my taxes go towards the healthcare system than the war machine) 


Where to start....
The environment cannot take a backseat to "national security"
If we fuck up the environment there will be no more nations to "secure" so....
Seriously, with sea levels rising and everyone sticking their head in the sand it could be that the climate refugees are the national security concern of the next decade.
Why the scare quotes? Because I don't think that waging war half way across the planet *increases* national security. If anything our foreign policy causes us to be a target.

Indeed, nature abhors a vacuum! I'm definitely on your side when it comes to this idea.
I think I used that word bc it was the first that came to mind, and it seems like some people who preach about anarchy would prefer there to be a power vacuum. (even if they only want it so that their ideology can fill the vacuum and they can enjoy the position of oppressor for a while)
My main concern, maybe call it an opposition, is that without something on the books that actually spells out what is OK and what isn't OK we would just have an exaggerated form of what we have now.
By that I mean there is nothing preventing a large company from ruining our shared ecosystem in pursuit of profit.
Can you provide an explanation for how anarchy would solve this problem?
I'm afraid that "the market" isn't a sufficient answer for me.
To me it seems that if all it took was economic pressure to prevent companies from destroying the planet then we would already be living in a lush, green "Eden".
You could argue that it's actually government interference and the capitalistic pursuit of profit above all else that causes our current situation, but to me that doesn't really solve the problem.
It's like anarcho-communism only focuses on HALF of the problem, ignoring the fact that the logical conclusion of unbridled capitalism is desolation of the planet
(I'm not trying to label you as an-cap, just sort of inferring)
BTW thanks for discourse! It's hard for me to process these ideas solely in my head, so I always appreciate thoughtful and civil discussion.

At least it's relevant to the hearings I guess.
