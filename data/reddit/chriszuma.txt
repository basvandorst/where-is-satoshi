Hodl. I recently discovered I had $10 in an old wallet from 2014. It’s now worth $250. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:37:25
It’s just a maximum. There’s a rule when you’re designing a protocol. Come up with he largest number you think anyone could ever want to use, and multiply it by at least a hundred.

The only reason other cryptocurrencies are cheaper or faster is because they are less popular.

From what I understand each party holds their own copy of a signed multisig transaction that can close out the lightning channel at any time, so if the network gets completely destroyed, you can just broadcast a settlement on the block chain. 
But yeah, I definitely agree that people are obsessed with the wrong aspect. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:55:14
It’s not a coupon, it IS the bitcoin. Pretty much any mobile wallet app can import a private key, but you’re probably better off just leaving it on the paper (at least until you learn some more about it and decide what you want to do) since it’s impossible to be hacked there. Just DO NOT let anyone see the private key bc that is the key to spend the bitcoin, and it cannot be unspent.

Interesting position, care to elaborate?

Bitcoin is not PayPal, not everyone is meant for it. The whole point is you become your own bank, it is a lot of responsibility and there’s no way around it.

Bitcoin was the first one, that’s literally the only reason. You think Mom is going to be interested in *another* cryptocurrency? Altcoin market cap explodes, and the news just says Bitcoin value is up because it’s a miracle people care at all, they’re not about to learn about all the technical differences.

No man, they pay the network fee for you! I got 100% of my balance into my other wallet. I think they’re trying to encourage people to use their exchange or something, I didn’t ask questions.

I found another post where someone got help exporting their keys, maybe this will help: 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:15:35
The private key QR code is useful for certain apps (I think Mycelium can read them) to quickly scan it in.
The app you're using probably just displays the public key corresponding to the private key, so you don't accidentally share it. The public key is just a function of the private key. You need the private one if you ever want to sign a transaction (i.e. send money), but only the public one to receive funds.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:52:43
I'm not familiar with that wallet, but maybe it's just locked up? Have you tried closing Chrome and restarting the PC? Chrome is kinda funny how it keeps running in the background sometimes. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:05
That's basically the source of all the drama and forks that have been swirling around. There's a holy war over the correct solution. Roger Ver wants to just make the blocks larger (e.g. the Bitcoin Cash fork, which is arguably also just a power/money grab), whereas others believe that is a temporary solution at best, and has a lot of downsides such as centralization.
Without some sort of scaling solution, Bitcoin will only ever be about as useful as Gold - a good way to store value, but not very good at buying things in general. Honestly that would not be that bad of a situation to be in, but If we want to support everyone's hopes and dreams for a fiat-free world, we will need either an off-chain solution like Lightning Network, or a completely different altcoin that can handle it. Increasing the block size is never going to get you there.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:07:00
Can you elaborate on that last sentence?

PSA to anyone reading this: if someone offers to buy BTC outside of an exchange using anything other than cash, it’s 100% a scam. 
Most forms of payment are refundable / cancelable. Bitcoin is not.

If you paste your private key into a random website you aren’t capable of using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:27:20
This was a web wallet I’m assuming. Basically that’s the company converting your bitcoin into WebWalletBuxx. They sweep all deposits into their main wallet address(es) and just record that your account has that balance. That allows them to do their optimizations and such, and is why we say that if you’re using a web wallet you don’t really have your bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:51:15

I'm not sure how Coinbase works internally, but a new address is generated for each transaction, so it might get lost in the ether.

That's kind of my point though. Both systems are perfectly safe for the average consumer, so there's not much incentive for your typical "buying things online" scenario.
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:41:20
I bought a flash drive from BitcoinStore just because I could.
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:34:17
Fair enough, but the fact is if a company like Amazon were to accept Bitcoin and then sell them immediately, the buying/selling pressure would necessarily be equalized in the long term because they have to come from somewhere.
And with the increased utility, more people would probably start buying and holding onto a balance, so the price would trend upwards.
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:35:17
I couldn't agree more.

You're assuming his code uses appropriate industry solutions? 
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:10:08
...which is kind of the point of change addresses in the first place, so it's not clear what part of a transaction is a payment vs. change. The whole system's kind of designed to be difficult to pin a volume to.
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:33:29
But if the server is compromised, I wouldn't want to leave my BTC there. 
WAT DO?!?!
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:39:00
Not a dumb question at all! This is a very important aspect of Bitcoin, but it has a very technical explanation. You need to understand a couple of things:
Bitcoin works by cryptographically signing transaction blocks. In layman's terms, this is finding the solution to a complex equation that can only be solved by brute-force. The hash rate is the total amount of solutions checked per second. People trying to find these solutions are called "miners".
The network works by all wallets agreeing to use the same ledger of transactions, which is determined by the longest chain of signed, or solved transaction blocks, and of course by which solution is found first for each link in the chain.
Now, if someone controls 51% of the hash rate, or equation solving power, then they can solve links in the chain faster than all other miners combined. This means that if they started solving links on a separate block chain, they would be faster than the official block chain.
What this allows them to do, is create a transaction on the official blockchain, say "send 100 BTC to an exchange", and simultaneously create a separate blockchain where that transaction doesn't exist. Then, they could convert those 100 BTC to fiat money or another altcoin and pocket it. Finally, when their separate block chain catches up in length to the official blockchain, it will be accepted as the new official blockchain, and now there is no record of the 100 BTC ever being sent. However, since they already withdrew the USD or Doge or whatever from their exchange account, they have effectively stolen that money.
Hopefully that helps. I started out hoping to keep this a simple explanation, but I don't think it's possible.

I love how the text literally says "I am an expert," right above referring to Bitcoin in "shares." 
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:46:00
And what does this code do that makes it worth spending BTC to run? I'm genuinely curious here.

That was a super informative article, thanks for posting it!
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:33:47
To also be fair, assuming an altcoin is a scam will be right 90% of the time.
@_date: 2014-03-25 16:37:58
This is a good point. I wonder how much of it is actually buying/selling for fiat money. Is there any way to measure that?

Ah, I must have misread the comment chain somehow.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:15:49
Just to play devil's advocate, it could be because nobody really knows how easy it is. If someone were to release an easy-to-use app or script to perform double-spend, you might start to see it happening.
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:28:34
But then the added utility it lends to the currency will make more people want to buy in. And over the next hill our rollercoaster goes!
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:40:14

Wtf is Ethereum and why should we care?
It looks like just another scammy altcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-07 20:13:28
What is it then? Would you mind explaining it, because from their website it just looks like an altcoin that they are selling the pre-mine for.
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:05:23
Yes, most wallets contain many addresses, and if I'm not mistaken the Bitcoin-Core client will manage its own change addresses which are in the wallet.dat file but not visible to the user. 
I'm not familiar at all with how SharedCoin works, it may be that somethign went wrong with their system.

Fine, maybe "threat" is the wrong word, but we're just arguing semantics now.

Fair enough. I guess I should have said 1/astronomically low.
@_date: 2014-07-17 14:56:19
This will be the end result of this legislation.
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:33:14
You think if Bitcoin dies anyone will want to use another cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:24:01
Yes, but the odds of someone having generated the same address in that time are astronomically low. Like, incomprehensibly low. If you generated 100 million addresses every second, it would take millions of years before you're likely to generate the same address twice.
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:05:49
That's great news! The price is sure to plummet!
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:32:58

@_date: 2014-05-23 18:56:07
Because I, a computer scientist and Bitcoin enthusiast, made a completely wrong assumption about what a "bit" was. What possible chance is there for mass adoption by non-technical people?
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:07:53
When you log into SharedCoin, does it show any change addresses? The screenshot on this wiki suggests it may manage them for you: 
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:23:14
Your second point is the more important one.
This should actually probably be removed. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:10:50
They'll probably still require you to present a card for incidentals at check-in though.
@_date: 2014-05-22 00:57:48
It seems to be the most well established online wallet, with tons of people using it and no big problems I'm aware of. 
That said, make sure she understands the risks and drawbacks of using an online wallet. You have to trust blockchain, and understand that they could run off with your bitcoins at any moment and there's nothing you could do. 
If her goal is to keep them and not spend them, definitely go for a cold storage solution.
@_date: 2014-06-30 19:55:34

It seems safer, until you consider that with a credit card, if someone steals your number and starts charging things, all you have to do is call the credit card company and they will give you all that money back. No such safety net for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:16:33
I just think we should go with a new, more descriptive term. Someone suggested "millies" which I actually like because the notation of mBTC would still work and there's no possible confusion.
@_date: 2014-05-22 01:14:05
Yes it is. You have the private keys, but so does blockchain. You don't have to worry about the website going down, but they could easily steal everyone's Bitcoins.

You joke......
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:23:27
Yeah, I think software is one of the places Bitcoin really shines, it's perfect for it.
For physical goods, it's not really any easier/safer since you still have to enter your address and everything anyway.

Right, all extensions are disabled, and history and cookies are purged upon exit. It may not be foolproof, but I feel a lot better about it.
We sometimes forget about the "This extension will be able to see all data on every webpage" warning when installing them. All it would take is a malicious entity buying out an extension you use (which has absolutely happened before), and scraping every page for things that look like private keys.

Tell that to my delicious bread sandwich
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:34:46
Well I'm out of ideas. You should definitely contact Blockchain and/or Sharedcoin, it sounds like something strange happened on their end. Hopefully they can sort it out easily if it's just a change address reporting problem.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:22:18
I'm not 100% sure what you are asking with the first question, but illustrations / graphic designs are a perfect product to sell for BTC. Digital goods and Bitcoin go well together because neither require physical presence, and once sent they can't be revoked. 
If you sell your illustrations for BTC, there's a lot you can do with them: Convert to USD on Coinbase or LocalTrader, buy things on websites such as Overstock or Dell, donate to charities, even use them to buy other digital goods from sellers such as yourself.
Bitcoin is also perfect for people who move around a lot! The only reason you would need a physical address to use Bitcoin is if you are buying/selling for USD from a company that requires that information. If you sell illustrations for BTC, then trade for cash using LocalBitcoins or Mycelium, you don't even have to give anybody your name.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:20:23

Of course, I'm in a relatively small town and most of that was from one repeat customer, so YMMV.
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:24:46
Yep, unfortunately there's not really a good way for them to detect this kind of fraud. They can check expiration easily, but the only way to test if a card is canceled is to try charging it periodically. 
If it becomes a problem for them, expect "instant buy" to get a lower limit or be discontinued.
Please don't pee in the punch bowl, people.

Well the USD is just as digital as Bitcoin nowadays, and probably more virtual. A better distinction would be cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:09:08
Also, carry any amount you want without worrying about it being seized
@_date: 2014-12-04 21:29:19
To be fair, we don't know how much of a cut Gyft is taking.
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:51:12
It looks like all of the major players are using one or the other. It would certainly be possible to roll your own code to accept bitcoin directly, but I think any "plug-and-play" payment software is going to make you go through their system so they can make money.
It would make a really good open source project, if there isn't one already.
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:43:18
Well they should be, since they don't have to amortize charge backs.
@_date: 2014-07-31 21:03:25
If you have employees in many different countries, this would be huge.
@_date: 2014-04-15 19:29:38
So in your theory, people would only spend what they already had at Amazon, and never buy any more? You really have a bleak outlook on Bitcoin don't you?
@_date: 2014-09-15 02:08:14
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:22:43
Also less than USD, and literally everybody invests in that.
@_date: 2014-04-17 16:14:21
When you say "successfully", what exactly happened? Were you able to steal goods or services, or transfer the double-spent coins to fiat?
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:49:06
Yeah they even have a word for it. Freud? Froud? Something like that.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:35:52
Ah, missed that.
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:20:55
I don't like it because it's an already established computer science term. People will be like "Well how much does a byte cost?"
Also it sounds too close to Bitcoin; it's unintuitive. Usually coins are smaller than whole things.
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:34:40
Log into your blockchain wallet and see if the funds are still there. A lot of wallets automatically generate new addresses and send change to them, so there's a good chance you still have control over they coins, they're just at a different address in your blockchain wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:07:01
To be fair, I've lost much more money on BTC price fluctuation than USD inflation.
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:18:38
The Mycelium android app is a great way to buy locally. 
You can also use eBay if you're desperate and want to pay a huge markup.
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:17:46
Just buy some, what's the problem?
@_date: 2015-01-17 15:20:55
You think the internet would still work when the shit really hits the fan?
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:25:00
We're comparing bitcoin exchanges to government issued money, not to private businesses
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:21:33
There's definitely a "remove one olive" type of opportunity here.

Cloud mining is usually unprofitable. If you're going to mine, buy the ASICs yourself and find some cheap electricity.
Of course, it's better for all of us if you buy directly because it keeps the price up.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:02:07
Yeah it's really a fantastic demonstration of why we need bitcoin. It's still too difficult and confusing for most people, but the seed has been planted in a lot of minds.
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:38:59
You can't exactly go to the police and say, "somebody hacked the admin account of my illegal drug marketplace" though.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:05:23
Mycelium local trader is also a good option for buying with cash
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:35:06
Now *that* would be a useful graph. This one, not so much.
Also, it wouldn't really have much to do with Bitcoin, since that is more related to labor markets and wealth distribution.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:35:20
Hi, I'm on reddit mobile and don't feel like trying to Google it, so what is PIA?
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:48:43
Congrats, and welcome. 
EDIT: It's hilarious that this comment got downvoted. Are you TRYING to turn away new members?
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:08:25
Withdraw cash and try localbitcoins or mycelium
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:35:10
All you have to do is install bitcoin core and give it a couple days to sync. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:19:08
You're right, this ***is*** actually good news :-P
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:04:12
I just tried setting up an ad to sell bitcoin through LBTC, and the first two buyers completely flaked out on me. I didn't have this problem at all with mycelium, is it really common?
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:30:23
This is going to attract scammers like ~~flies to shit~~ scammers to KickStarter.
@_date: 2015-01-23 04:29:25
For such a clickbait headline, that was a surprisingly good article.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:06:29
So are you a millionaire now?
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:27:32
You forgot the step where the customers buy the coins to give to Amazon. Net effect on price: zero (except for the increased consumer confidence)
@_date: 2018-10-15 15:31:06
Until too many people try to cash out at once and Tether can’t cover it. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:34:08
No, that’s what lightning network is for. Any pure block chain solution is fundamentally not scalable
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:53:27
I’m usually too afraid to download some sketchy wallet program and put my private keys into it. I did do it for BCH though since the ratio was worth it
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:26:23
I’m out of the loop on this. What’s BIP70?
@_date: 2015-04-19 16:08:18
Have you considered this is one of the reasons they are pro bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-04-19 15:42:45
I think in his case, it's more about the hassle of proving his identity is valid than trying to protect it
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:20:36
Are e-cigs popular on reddit? I've never seen them mentioned until just now
@_date: 2015-04-19 16:13:48
Sarcasm I hope?
@_date: 2015-04-19 16:13:06
He probably can't get one. You need a US address and to pass a credit check which usually requires a social security number.
@_date: 2015-04-20 03:19:42
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:20:10
Why does it have such terrible reviews in the app store?
@_date: 2015-04-29 01:16:53
First I've heard of this, that's pretty cool!
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:37:44
Yeah, not sure what the usefulness of this is...
Maybe they're just testing that functionality on its own in case it breaks something and they'll enable wallets for the stable release.
@_date: 2015-04-19 16:18:01
I agree with all of your points except your dismissal of the possibility of being defrauded by merchants. This is actually the main sticking point for online shopping with bitcoin: you must trust the merchant. In newegg's case it's fine, but I recently bought a lamp from a smaller online retailer because they were the only ones with it in stock, and they never sent it. Visa gave me my money back.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:49:52
LocalBitcoins is probably the way to go when you need cash. That can be kind of hit-or-miss though, and at least where i live almost nobody accepts Bitcoin, so you'll probably end up using your credit/debit cards a fair amount. Good luck!
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:55:06
I always put "cash or bitcoin only" on my Craigslist posts. No takers on the bitcoin so far though.
