Thanks for your comment, I was able to make some adjustments because of it. For starters on the Bitgo part of the post, I agree it was a little misleading. Second, I was also able to find their bank on the the deposits section like you suggested :).  
As far as your second point goes...
Whats scares me is that if the Government of China suddenly decides to stop allowing Chinese bitcoin endeavors, Okcoin.cn will surly take a dive (even if their servers are in Middle Earth) and will drag Okcoin.com along with it.

Good to know and will give it a read!

Thank you!

I do think Bitstamp could do bit more to increase its functionality and like you said keep up with other exchanges. However Bitstamp's simplistic UI makes it an effective tool for anyone begging to trade Bitcoin.  
Bitstamp is also the go to exchange for a lot of bitcoin startups who have to continuously buy and sell bitcoin on bulk. Some of these are Romit, and Bitreserve. This could be the reason behind why they don't spend so much time increasing the trade functionality.

Will do and thanks a bunch!

You're right, I was talking about Okcoin.com and I've edited the post. Thanks!

Yea! I found some people on localbitcoins who are willing to do it :), Thanks!

You're right, I didn't talk about that safety issue and since it was a key factor on my decision I should have. Also I'm pretty sure Coinapult is not decentralized and like you said requires a trusted third-party same as Bitreserve but thats not what checked my safety box. What did it for me was Bitreserves real time [transparency]( it's yoga knowing where my money is.

And even not tech savvy people, maybe theres some people who love having bitcoin because it's "decentralized" or w e the reason but are not fully aware of what having this decentralized currency means.

do you keep all your savings in BTC? Why are you worried + honestly I'm a bit more worried about it becoming illegal.

I agree its still early and even that were the gen 1.1 but don't you think there's some or rather a bunch* who just have some because it's a cool new thing? Some sort of every ones doing it deal.

Thats a little extreme but whatever their vision might be, I really just care about finding the best service
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:43:07
Great tip! Yea, I don't really care about trading for other currencies.

My friend in Mexico doesn't want to deal with bitcoin.  And she certainly doesn't want to go to a bitcoin ATM three times. But thank you, I actually found someone willing to do it.

No problem and thanks for the tip! my next endeavor is doing a Bitshares vs Okcoin comparison. But I'll gladly help you... so you're having doubts about Coinapults gold locks and Bitreserves bitgold card? 
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:52:55
May I ask why you care for decentralization?(Im just curious) You should give these other exchanges a try: Okcoin, Bitstamp. If you're Australian give Coinjar a try, seems cool. Also I think Coinbase now lets you keep USD in your wallet. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:52:35
I 'm actually looking at other exchanges. Which do you recommend?  What I like about Bitreserve is being able to trade immediately also if you're just a regular guy its great to just keep whichever currency you want. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:07:05
I haven't really gone into gold but if you give me some time I'll def. dig into it and share my findings with you. 
I just started messing around with Bitshares, its crashed a few times which is kind of annoying. Also I rather just  play with bitcoin. Maybe I come around though.
