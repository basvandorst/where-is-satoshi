No shit I ran upstairs to do a few things and came back down to that spike.

That's what I was seeing too. Now Coinbase is "[Down for maintenance](

Can't even make a transfer because of error messages and "try again later" messages. I just want to buy a sports package for $30 lol

Downvoted by Circle employees

Seriously does anyone read anything? Yes I have contacted support. They said it was an error on their part that happens to 5% of customers. I just asked for my money back and they allowed my account to cash out.
Signed up for Coinbase with 0 problems. Circle just sucks.

I don't think you read the OP. I transferred funds (with a debit card) and now they are stuck in limbo. Every transaction I try fails with no explanation. Cash out button gives me an error.
I've talked to Circle and they altered my account so I could cash out and use Coinbase which hopefully doesn't suck as much.

Because I verified my credit card and added funds already. What would verifying my bank account do?
The problem is not with my source of funds, I don't know what makes you think this.

What kind of regulation is locking up my funds and giving me error messages?
It was a common bug on their part according to their customer support. I do not expect bugs, lol, everyone told me Circle was so simple, but 5% of their customers getting this error is pretty big. Coinbase gave me 0 problems, much easier and more user friendly.

Because that info is irrelevant if I already have funds in my account.
The issue, as stated in OP, was that the funds are unavailable to use or cash out. Stuck in limbo with error messages.
