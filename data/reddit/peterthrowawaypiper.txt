I called him out respectfully on his Facebook page a few weeks ago regarding how he proposes to divorce the blockchain and the unit of account as he loves one and derides the other. All I got was a hand-wavy answer which avoided the question, I then asked him to clarify and elaborate... 
Does not reply, deletes post a few days later. Guy is all bark and no bite which is evident with the amount of ad hominem he uses combined with no counter-argument on his central argument (blockchain revolutionary, Bitcoin worthless, no answer as to how you can divorce the two.)

Which has nothing to do with what I was saying.

History is boring? Seriously? Since when was being ignorant cool? 
So much cool shit has happened historically, unless you don't bother to read.

Maybe if we all get on the same page as the OP we can make it happen! Just believe. 
Close your eyes, click your heels together 3 times whilst saying 'Satoshi' softly each time.

Reputation. Not once was I scammed over many orders without escrow as I used reputable sellers; once a package didn't arrive and the seller sent another at no cost. 
Works well, reputation is everything.

Which is only applying to people which directly own your private keys and interact with fiat currencies which given the numerous cases of abuse in the Bitcoin community seems absolutely legitimate...

Derides* 
If a moderator reads this can you delete these two posts as I already edited my first post.

You're going to point to a relatively miniscule decline in the hash rate despite it growing logarthimically for years as evidence of Bitcoins demise? 
Seriously? Mind explaining why I should give your theory any credence whatsoever? 
@_date: 2014-10-30 17:49:02
To be fair I did get my DRK back.

Decides the other*
On phone.

And you're ignoring the fact that a single Bitcoin is worth 300+ USD despite being worth nothing a few years ago.

Bitpay takes on the double spend risk and allows instant confirmation... The company in question obviously has a terrible implementation.

I'm kinda hoping that they ban it, will be an interesting case study and may potentially expedite use 
Such a ban will simply push it underground and have the unintended consequence of helping the network evolve to deal with such a hostile regulatory environment. More  mixing, more anonymity, less control from the state.

Not on my S3. Have to login on a pc.

Sold enough to cover my initial investment. Also sold a bunch of Litecoin at 0.05 which worked out fantastically. 
Sitting on the rest.

What percentage change is the price from 2, 3, 4 years back? Point being it's very far from over. Show me a decline in users, transactions, business and VC investment. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 12:04:46
I don't think so, I got in sub-100.
@_date: 2014-10-28 10:55:15
I bought 20 my first time with Bitcoin &lt; 3 
@_date: 2014-11-12 03:20:45
That wasn't the question. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 13:58:14
Look at a 5 year graph of the price... Do you even logic? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 13:05:02
How is that even relevant? 
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:56:08
Wait what. The US dollar used to be backed by gold whilst printed on paper. How then is a commodity currency less portable?

Try buying enough to trade on and travelling the world doing so... 
It becomes hard to be phased. Though without the Internet I get ancy as hell.

Moderation is the key really; without it drugs can be awful. Luckily enough for me I'm content taking MDMA a handful of times a year with an LSD trip once or twice. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 08:30:11
You should try better drugs then, not that I disagree with your statement. Both are pretty great.

No, it's Rub3x.

Because it is a means transferring information. 
ps Bitcoin has hundreds of millions of dollars in hashing hardware behind it
