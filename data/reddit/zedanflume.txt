Complains about price being at 14k. Just sell, you don't belong here.

I just think about where we were six months ago and laugh. *Bigger picture guys.*

Yea, I'm devastated over a 11k bitcoin. /s
*It's like people forgot we live in a world where a single bitcoin is worth over 10k.*

Translated into 2013;
"I bought into the "1k by the end of the year" hype. And now I'm 300 down and the way the past two weeks are goung, I don't think Bitcoin is coming near the 1k again. Just being realistic."

Mainstream? You call this mainstream? We're not even close yet. When your mother actively uses and manages her own bitcoin and wallet on her own accord, then we're mainstream. 
We're still a ways out. When you step out of the echo chamber you'll realize how little the average consumer knows about bitcoin. And that's the exciting part.

There's something about money they are legally allowed to move in and out of the country. But I don't remember the exact details.

You have to understand that this is because the value of their currency is that much worse then ours. They have to trade at a premium. This same thing happens with the Indian rupee. Does this mean bitcoin is worth $17K? No. *Not yet at least.*

*yup, we're nearing the top boys*

If I had to take a guess the Turkish currency is not as strong as the USD and is trading at a premium because of it. I highly doubt they have enough volume to drive the price up before other markets.
