That's odd, well a lot of the exchanges opened in 2011/2012 so it makes sense if you purchased through something like Coinbase or Kraken. If you mined it then tell them this. 
Strange that they want to see accounts as Revolut is just a place to store fiat instead of a regular bank. Their whole idea is to move away from banks. I would perhaps try and set up a call with them to raise your limit.

Get yourself a Revolut.

If you had 25k, don't waste your money. It could eventually fall back down to $20 you never know with things like this.
It may be another Tulip bubble... nobody can give you the answer but if I had 25k I would not throw it at a gamble, you may as well go put it on Red or Black at the casino.
One point to remember, if it shoots up to $1,000 are you even going to be able to sell? Probably not... Who is gonna pay $1000 per if they know they can wait 2/3 weeks and buy it for 1/3 of the price.

Well best of luck to you, did you put much money in? My view is, I only have around £500 to spare, if I put that in at $400/500 and it shoots up to $1000 I will have made an extra £500, its not worth losing £500 to make £500 in my current situation so investing in Bitcoin is not worth my time. 
You never know that it could be deemed worthless soon, many more alternatives are being created, what is making this Bitcoin the standard for secure transfers?

You were meant to take it with a pinch of salt, it could drop to $200, if you bought in at $650 you're gonna be kicking yourself for that.
Right now there is a huge price increase due to people thinking they can make a quick buck, investing $20,000 in and waiting to sell at higher prices, they list it for $900, it doesn't sell so they lower the price, and lower, and lower, and lower until it will sell, by that time they've either got their money back or made a loss due to the bubble bursting and everyone else pulling out.
My advice is to put a bit of disposable income maybe $50-200 into it when it crashes to $300 and just leave it for a few months and see where the market goes. Stop worrying yourself about its current fluctuations as these are merely people trying to make a buck and don't hold any long term promise.
If Bitcoin kicks off for good then it may rise to $20,000 for 1 BTC. You never know though, it's the same for any new thing like this, Beanie Babies, Tulip etc.
