I'm very well aware of how to circumvent this, thanks. Doesn't really have anything to do with my comment.

With who? No one's going to by that gold at today's value when that gold will be worth shit when they get it.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:59:32


Which is more work than just running a private one on your mining rig, as I said.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:46:02
While I get that you're trying to call me an idiot because you disagree with me, *I'm* not calling anything a scam, so your comeback doesn't really work.
Might want to work on that.
@_date: 2014-12-13 07:58:01


You missed the part about how once you've acquired it, you've just completely destroyed the value of gold. Most likely in the end it will be a net loss.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:54:53
I really don't see how you could reasonably come to the conclusion that *I'm* a scammer. I'm not even trying to sell anyone on anything.
Who exactly am I trying to scam? with what? If you're going to make accusations you should at least try to put some content in them, even if you need to fabricate it.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:36:34
Buy a used printer from a thrift store or even salvage one from a dump/e-waste facility.
Wear gloves when handling everything, hairnets too.
Drop 'em in a public mailbox that's nowhere near your home, it would already be a federal crime anyway so what's that matter?
Use an anonymizer.
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:55:05
Exxactly, i've on many occasions found myself in this same prediciment, though not exactly as big as this.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:56:37
Remain the dominant means of "secure" intra-business document transferal?
Not even joking, most businesses still transfer documents via fax because they don't trust the security of scanning and emailing.
Source: I've had to on multiple occasions fax documents to other businesses because they would not accept emailed forms at my old job.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:00:08
Everything's a scam if you listen to idiots.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:02:58
Well yes, technically. If you want to be pedantic, it's just a node, not the *entire* p2pool, as that wouldn't make any sense. But OP never said it was anyway.
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:47:54
Well, if they did that it would slow down the devaluation of the product for a bit, but it will still devalue noticeably. However, there's a high risk that during that time *another* company will start their own space mining operations, devaluing your gold further. It would probably be more profitable to sell it in bulk ASAP (but still at a loss).
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:04:19
I have no idea. I've found their [YouTube]( [Google+]( and [Twitter]( pages and there's absolutely no info on them whatsoever. Where the hell is the news even coming from? They all seem to be reporting about a ghost.

The money you'd get from &lt;bank&gt; in case of a hack would come from &lt;bank&gt;s profit margins, not "nowhere".
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:17:33
Disclaimer? The hell are you talking about?
I'm saying that entire box there is listing things that there will be "Anonymous reports of".
Although upon further examination, it's rather ambiguous whether that "Anonymous reports of:" heading belongs to both columns  or just the right one, and given the way each item is phrased it *does* seem like that's the case. 
So my initial understanding is wrong, but I still don't know what "disclaimer" you're talking about.

Unless they've completely changed everything in the last few months, p2pool.org is most deffinately a p2pool node.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:52:50
He doesn't, he's just full of shit. I can only assume he's complaining about the mining fee, which is present in every public p2pool node. Unless you're running your own, the maintainer of the node get's a (very) small part of your profits, which is a perfectly reasonable system.
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:46:46


If you actually read the note, it doesn't threaten any such thing.
They're only threatening to *anonymously report* that said business *products* are contaminated with mercury.
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:56:59
Try re-reading my comment, I just said that.
I still don't know why you're looking for a "disclaimer".
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:32:29
It sounds *exactly* like what someone would say if they had no idea what the fuck the reporter was talking about, he even called them "bitcoms".
@_date: 2014-03-24 06:14:27
TIL less than two hours is a "long time".
@_date: 2014-07-05 03:13:59
It never sends me the text or w/e to get it working. After rechecking the number hundreds of times and requesting a resend many more, i just stopped bothering with it.
Google Auth just requires me to scan a QR code.
I've never cared much about aesthetics, and if you don't have your phone locked, a seperate pincode on the app doesn't do much more than inconvenience the user.
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:52:45
The bitcoms note was about other comments he had made, not that specific quote. The first part of my comment was about that quote, which is exactly what a tired old man who has no idea what you're talking about, but once worked on secret government projects he is not allowed to discuss, would say.
@_date: 2014-07-05 02:30:48
You say Authy is easier to use, but I have never once been able to get anything to work with it.
Google Auth works simply with no hassles.

In reality, if you get mugged and you don't have any cash, you're gonna have a bad time.

Ha, no.

Joining a public p2pool node is easy, probably easier than joining any other node.
*Running* a p2pool node requires a bit of work, and running a public one requires even more.
@_date: 2014-06-18 17:06:42


Seriously? That would be the easiest (paying) work i'd ever done if i'd had the intent to do that myself. What kinda lazy-ass job do you get paid for?
And it wouldn't be for "300$", more like a few thousand at least. Sending out just one would be stupid, send out many.
@_date: 2016-01-04 00:59:25
it says "1000 feet = 304.8 m".

But you don't need a Ripple Trade wallet to use the ripple network.
What you're saying is more akin to "Coinbase will never send you this" which is blatantly and obviously not the case.
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:08:59
I don't use (or even know what is) Localbitcoins or BTCJam, nor do I have a coinbase account.
Must be supplementing the target list with data from some other service as well.
Weird thing is that it was sent specifically to "NekoNingen with the capitals. I haven't actually used capitals in my address for years and never with any coin related service, so i have no idea where they got it from.
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:29:21
Which is also why you can choose not to use Ripple Trade.
@_date: 2015-09-08 05:43:24
Yeah, bud, it's not because you disagree with them, it's because you're an ass about it. Seriously, go read just the last page of your most recent comments, you might note that when you're actually being productive you at least are above 0 points, you're only really being downvoted when you're being an outright ass.
@_date: 2015-09-08 05:31:56
I'd assumed I'd already unsubscribed because i haven't seen a post from this sub in my front page for like, months, until this one.
@_date: 2015-04-08 22:01:59
I also got it, but have no idea what Localbitcoins is.
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:28:58
You also don't have to use Ripple Trade if you want to use ripple.
@_date: 2015-03-03 06:45:40
Honestly? Bitcoin itself doesn't have a future, just accept it. It's poorly setup for practical everyday use and there's no good way to fix it without completely breaking everything.
The *concept* on the other hand definitely has a promising future, much of the possibilities of which have already begun to present themselves.
@_date: 2015-03-04 04:39:30
Right, because knowing that someone somewhere in the area also has a bitcoin wallet will be ample resources needed to pinpoint exactly who and how to get into their wallet and steal their bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-20 21:41:05
...most of these services are *already* technology man.

I'm hardly the one being lazy here. You're the one who couldn't construct a proper sentence and didn't even hint at half of your meaning.

Add compatibility for multiple alt coins, and some sort of vending machine interface, and you'll have (almost) all my money. (I'll need some to use it with, obviously.)

Considering they marked their charts in thousands leads me to believe that that is indeed the way they're defining their bytes.
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:03:33
The difference would be that OP is not *selling* the stamp to people and expecting them to use it to mark currency. He's just marking things himself.

@_date: 2013-05-30 07:03:58
Do you speak it? Your original statement is gibberish, if you expected anyone to understand what you just explained to me from that statement you're an idiot.
"For all those downvoting, bitcointip is like an upvote!" would have at least conveyed your first part. But nothing in that statement even begins to hint that "upvoting the bot is slightly absurd". Which is an incorrect assumption anyway since votes for bitcointip are at least helpful for the bot to keep it from running into post delay issues.
Seriously, English is a crazy language but it isn't that hard to at least make a bit of sense.
@_date: 2013-09-04 03:44:38
Yes, you did, and discussion is one thing, you're just bitching about bullshit.

Not quite, last reading seems to say 7989MB.
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:35:42
I highly doubt they said it *quite* like that.
@_date: 2013-03-28 02:42:45
1024 megawatts, obviously.
@_date: 2013-08-01 19:24:48
Maybe for others, I don't really have any feelings regarding bitcoin acceptance by some irrelevant guy.
He's either being sarcastic or an asshole, but either way people are reacting over nothing.
