Most of what you need is available through public APIs and you can write pretty simple code to handle point of sale.
You can query the exchange of your choice for current exchange rate. Timestamp that info, write it to a log file. Next, input amount due in usd, use the rate to calculate BTC due, write that to the log. Pick a public address and use it + btc due to generate a qr code for your customer to scan. Once the tx is broadcast, use your pub address with a block explorer API to get the txID, write it to the log.
Finally, write a little script to crawl through your log file and do the accounting for you.
Edit: your team members would only ever know your public address, so no worries there.

Yeah, trump is monitoring BTC... through the coinbase app between tweets while he's on the shitter.

Think you'll be able to con enough suckers to pay for that actor, OP?

But how can we know that? A great advantage of btc is that it's a trustless payment system, yet you come here asking people to trust you. Very unlikely they will.

To clarify, are you saying you cannot sell while you have a pending buy order?

Not entirely certain, but I think they are displaying your effective rate with fee included.

I'm really pleased with my trezor. Never used a Ledger so can't compare, but trezor is very easy to operate and transact with. The user has appropriate control over miner fees. It handled segwit and the bcash fork smoothly. Also support was great the one time I contacted the manufacturer.

When your business accepts Bitcoin, you send a positive message to the entire Bitcoin community.  You reach potential customers in a way that is difficult to achieve via traditional marketing methods.  Bitcoin users are an ardent bunch.  Above all, they want to see this technology continue to develop and grow.  Some view Bitcoin as a long-term store of value, so not every user wants to spend his Bitcoin.  However, every user wants more businesses to accept it, for that is the key to growth.  Whether by Bitcoin or dollar or word-of-mouth, this community routinely goes out of its way to promote and support businesses that support Bitcoin.

You are a victim of criminal fraud. File a police report.

Seems more like due caution to me. There are more efficient ways to increase effective block size that don't require a hard fork. 2X on the other hand strikes me as a reckless move motivated by greed.

Congratulations OP! Please listen to the advice of others in this thread: stay on the right side of the IRS.
