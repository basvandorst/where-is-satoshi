I really think this 'tipping' in relation to music/artistic content is going to be one of the pivotal catalysts to mainstream adoption. How this will be best implemented I am eager to watch.

Thanks for the kind words. I enjoyed writing it as it helped reinforce in me the many benefits Bitcoin has over traditional payment services. I aim to write some more Bitcoin/Music related articles in the near future. Moon ;)

I have recently become slightly obsessed with Bitcoin, and have as such written my latest blog post on Bitcoin and its potential influence on the Music Industry. Feel free to check it out and offer any comments/criticism.

Hey,  I am based in Australia and have been using Coinjar to purchase my Bitcoin. They charge 2% on purchases and the process of setting up an account is reasonably straight forward. You just need to verify your identity by uploading some documents, and your bank account. I have found their exchange rate is often  higher (approx $6-10) than across major exchanges which should be noted. However the UI and purchasing process once set up is easy to use. I haven't tried any other exchanges but will be willing to change if I find a better and cheaper option.

I've tried using both Firefox and chrome, no luck with either.

When I plug it in holding in the two buttons, all that is displayed is the lock logo.
It does prompt me that firmware 1.2.1 is available, and that I need to update. However I just can't seem to get the device in boot mode to allow the update.
Thanks for your reply

Does anyone know what they were actually chuckling about in this photo?

I've tried this (Unplug Trezor -&gt; Hold both buttons down and keep them pressed -&gt; Plug in USB cable) about 15 times now, was thinking it may be a defective button.
Pretty frustrating considering the length of time it took to come.

When you reach the checkout page, once you complete the customer information form below it will take you to the shipping and payment method page (where you can select to pay with bitcoin). :)

I recently launched a hemp-based, organic skin care company in Australia. We happily accept bitcoin :)

Just finished watching this before I came to reddit. Let's make a blockchain with no reward system, that'll work just fine...

Spot on. It intrigues me how people sound like they have such a good grasp on bitcoin and blockchain technology, then say something like "forget about bitcoin". They will get there eventually I guess.
