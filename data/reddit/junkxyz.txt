They also said that your recurring purchases would be grandfathered in at the lower (1%) fee, but I don't think that's the case as my last purchase reported a fee (you can read it in the confirmation emails) of 1.5%.
Anyone have a similar experience?
I'm going to stop buying on Coinbase. (I might stop buying with fiat overall and just buy/sell tangible goods on OpenBazaar)

True true. I actually just bought some silver from them cash, that's the only reason I even knew the exchange rate was tilted off the top of my head. Do you have any idea what the full trip losses are after the JMBullion exchange rate and markup and the dealer/pawnshop markup? I'm trying to decided between this/OpenBazaar/purse.io/hold.

I noticed that their exchange rate for Bitcoin was slightly worse than Coinbase though, so factor that into your losses.

Maybe I made a mistake trying to actually use Bitcoin haha. I'll just hoard and speculate like everyone else.

Cool! You're way ahead of me then. Still trying to think up something to sell on OpenBazaar, used to love the old eBay. Good luck on your business!

Step 1 is to find the melting point of whatever it is you're trying to liquidate. Water's is 0 C, for example.

I would actually recommend waiting until OpenBazaar is online. You can sell there for Bitcoin directly, and avoid Ebay's ~13% fee.
I want to do it myself, but I don't have anything of value just lying around anymore haha. I've moved too many times lately and really pared down my belongings.

Haha yeah, but at that point, I'm really just buying with USD then, "money-changing." I might just hold on to it or seek out another auction site. Hell, maybe I should just build my own...
@_date: 2016-01-21 06:47:49
I'll look into it, thanks! But I need more advice, almost beginning to end explanation of the process. I think actually transferring money to a public key from Coinbase will be easy, but how do you generate the public key (and keep the private key secure) in the first place?
@_date: 2016-01-07 07:54:37
Oh shit, thanks for the link. Yeah they looked to good to be true, which is why I wanted to check here first. 
Really I was just looking for an auction site where I can buy tangible goods like eBay (any suggestions?), rather than just... money-changing... for lack of a better word. It's sort of an experiment to convince myself that I can actually buy something with this magical internet money that I have...
@_date: 2016-01-25 21:45:57
I've used Coinbase. The fees are pretty low, and it's very above board (but therefore less private) if that's a concern. 
I've also heard good things about a Japanese exchange called Mt. Gox. Never used it myself though...
@_date: 2016-01-22 04:01:06
Thanks! I think this'll do. I'll do it as soon as I get another printer.

It's cool to hear everyone's thoughts; money is pretty weird for something that we all take for granted. This post was mostly a product of daydreaming/procrastinating anyway. I'm hoping we get price stability eventually. That's why I invested in some Bitcoin. It can't just be ctrl-p'd into oblivion. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 05:20:51
E.g. I actually bought a Zimbabwean 20 Trillion Dollar bill once just for fun ($8.99 on Ebay, a steal!). I can put it next to my pre-1965 quarter collection as tangible artifacts of inflation.
@_date: 2016-02-02 21:38:08
Well, can't argue with that haha. I'm wondering if it will happen with anything else soon. A pizza has been $10 at Costco since I was in kindergarten. Bitcoin needs an equivalent.

Will there be any way to link to your eBay/Amazon feedback ratings so users can trust you as a new store?
