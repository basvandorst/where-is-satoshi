Well most people thought they would be rich in a month, not 12-24 before they saw decent gains. The bull run was quick to grab their attention, and the corresponding bear run just as easily lost it.
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:07:14
And we have the crux of the issue right here folks
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:37:48
As we all should be. Derivatives are one of the pillars of the old system Satoshi was trying to get away from.
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:19:57
Well work on your patience then, could be a few years until we get back close to 20K 
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:49:08
That’s what I’m hoping for 
@_date: 2018-08-22 21:39:32
Yea it’s pretty common knowledge, I remember seeing reddit threads about it
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:47:31
Damn, how’s the anxiety with that much in the market?
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:57:24
I have no problem buying now, but does that really mean I can’t hate myself anymore? Not sure I’m willing to give that up even for BTC 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:57:43
There are already backdoors on every antminer. [ \- for more info

Sometimes it takes a second look from a trusted person to put us on the right track. I'm glad you took his advice, BCH is a ridiculous scam
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:31:53
Then sell, sounds like you don't really have the stomach for investing. Go put your money in a mutual fund, and let someone who has some balls play with your money.
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:17:04
this person doesn't seem to have much common sense, so it might not even help them

Seems like more and more people these days are just hoping bitcoin is their golden ticket, rather than understanding and believing that the tech behind it is valid
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:07:06
there is no way this is real
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:26:05
just look up Berkshire Hathaway's performance vs. the SP 500. Under performing by 2% since 2008. His funds used to perform way over market, but that is not the case anymore...

Yea there is a whole group of people who still buy that Ulbricht wasn't just in it for the money. He amassed millions of dollars people, he's not some ideological hero
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:26:36
there's a reason why there are so many copy-cat coins. They try to pick a name and trading tag that are similar to an established blockchain to confuse people and make some money before people realize they are just another shitcoin

which are almost unilaterally only money

lol the great newbpocalypse is such a great term. One of my friends bought at 14K and just sold at 8K because he didn't want to lose more. All I could do was shake my head and tell him he will regret that given some time.

wow how reserved of you for even giving two weeks. The moment I even heard about Bitcoin I called my boss and told him to eat my dick

That charlatan was extremely easy to spot from the get go. I have a hard time feeling bad for people who thought Jihan was going to make them rich hahaha. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:52:26
So what. Your post is retarted 
@_date: 2019-03-22 18:45:55
Don’t feed the troll 
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:28:17
Yeah, I'm not sure why she's on stage. Just because she was high up in the Federal Reserve, doesn't necessarily mean she knows anything about crypto.
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:06:51
No, but it’s a general rule of thumb that you should understand the terms you are trying to use haha 
@_date: 2018-10-04 00:17:19
A poor copy at that 
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:09:29
If anyone is investing so much that losing it will ruin their life, it’s really not your fault even if you tell them to invest in bitcoin cash, it’s their fault for risking more than they can lose. Literally the number one rule of investing.
@_date: 2019-11-28 13:55:49
I would never, was just using a worthless product as an example
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:26:31
yeah whatever, I guess I don't respect the world of traditional finance, because that's not all that impressive to me.
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:53:55
I think the nuke deserves that title more
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:38:42
yeah, I didn't realize that. Still doesn't mean she has any authority to speak about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-22 22:39:41

woah there beta boy, does his work ethic and success make you feel inadequate? 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:23:57
exactly, pretty easy to sell my father on it. He imports and exports huge quantities of industrial fasteners, and always complains about the inconveniences of wiring money. Pretty fucking impossible to sell my friends on bitcoin, when all of them just use banks for credit cards and basic checking account services.
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:15:01
Yea there are way too many avenues now for them to possibly keep up with 
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:56:56
That's what really sold me on cryptos. Every time I see FUD, it's so intellectually dishonest, and obvious fear-mongering.
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:49:17
So only correct right when I wake up ;)

Great job, this is a great video to show people who want to get started on the road to truth and knowledge
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:06:26

gonna be funny in a few years when they start asking you how to buy in
@_date: 2018-06-20 19:44:15
Well to be fair to those people, most of them have journalism degrees, not economics. They are literally taught to find sources and stitch information together into a segment. They are not taught how to understand topics like economics and technology, if they did they probably would realize how worthless a journalism degree actually is

@_date: 2018-06-22 17:39:07
the mystery and the fun. Once you know how to look for and "predict" trends you can make money in a down market. I put "predict" in quotes because it's an extremely inexact science

@_date: 2018-06-26 23:16:40
It is apparent and obvious that he has no idea what he is talking about, he doesn't even bring up a single good point. 
@_date: 2019-10-21 23:44:17
yea but they also had to keep track of it in a spreadsheet. They deserve all our money, no one else can possibly keep track of stuff.
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:07:21
haha cryptos move on no one person's schedule bud. Why have a specific  date in mind?
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:35:23
Why would that make you a bad person? Nothing wrong with hoping the doors of opportunity stay open just a tad bit longer
@_date: 2018-06-26 15:24:13
Do you happen to know the smallest amount of BTC you need to put into your channel?
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:08:43
So you don't sell on spikes and re-buy on dips? Seems like you aren't maximizing your holdings....
@_date: 2018-06-26 20:25:49
Just tell me when moon; I'm sick of all this complicated math.
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:06:58
If you knowingly commit a crime, you give up your right to freedom. There is such a thing as a social contract, whether you like it or not makes no difference.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:36:15
Holy fuck no one has any patience these days. Bitcoin isn't some free ride to being rich, but if you actually understood that you wouldn't have made this meme..... 
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:14:20
Yes everybody please sell, it would really help me out
@_date: 2019-06-19 22:59:59
Trump is non-traditional, but he also doesn’t want to get assassinated by the Federal Reserve; that’s not going to happen.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:41:20
Once again enforcing the idea that if you don’t hold your keys, you don’t actually own anything.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:38:26
That dude isn’t dead, it’s pretty obviously an exit scam 
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:55:52
Exactly, a drop in the bucket 
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:30:24
Which is why Trump is trying to get help from the Mexican government, because our own congress surely won’t come to a compromise with him.
If we start capitulating to these people, it will embolden even more to cross the border illegally, which will make the infrastructure even more crowded.
Deporting illegals already here will further dissuade people from entering our country illegally.
Not to mention what an actual border wall will do to the numbers coming across.
What do you propose we do about it? Because simply complaining about the problem gets nothing done.
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:36:36
Whatever you just smoked, I need that shit 
@_date: 2019-02-12 02:33:18
Well i don’t think jack even knows about doge coin, so not a valid opinion
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:04:45
I wholeheartedly agree
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:40:15
Judging from these tweets it won’t be long until they do 
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:23:54
Came here to say exactly this. Would be fine for home use, but not in a business. I did find my manager running an antminer in one of our server rooms last January, but I don't sign his paychecks so I didn't say shit, and now all my requests for time off are instantly approved.
@_date: 2019-02-14 21:00:51
Because there’s nothing to fill the blocks with. If I remember correctly the vast majority were empty hahaha 
@_date: 2019-06-20 00:25:25
Yes this is a bitcoin sub, but a post about Trump, and I didn’t bring up this subject in the first place.
And yes this is not productive. Good day to you, and I hope your bitcoin holdings do well.

Don’t trade off of advice you got from a YouTube TA video

What are you mining?
@_date: 2019-12-01 21:28:32
It would be a huge blow, but the markets came back from mt gox, so there’s no reason to think that they wouldn’t come back from Coinbase going under
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:00:44
My entire family thinking I am an idiot for having more in BTC than the stock market is my price. Which is fine by me haha.
@_date: 2018-11-23 03:10:50
Well that remains to be seen. You are acting like the book is closed, when there are many more chapters. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:53:03
if the markets keep it up, the price will make them irrelevant haha. No one is buying miners right now, and there are so many people who have S9's that will never see ten percent of their purchase back. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:26:56
lol don’t get back into the game. This will keep happening to you. Let people with some balls play this game. Go put your money in a mutual fund so you can’t waste it all. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 20:02:03
That long ago haha 
@_date: 2019-01-02 18:30:42
it seems you missed the point entirely. They are trying to get out in front of censorship, what does it matter if they are "well off" or not. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:04:52
no, Bitcoin is Google, and Blockchain is a buzzword
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:11:40
That is also true

Their msm networks are crumbling. Just look at msnbc dwindling viewership 
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:11:12
to be fair to them, most people are just not smart enough to properly understand crypto. And as we all know, if something is too difficult for the masses to understand, it is quickly labeled dangerous and outlawed.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:17:23
Just BTW for future reference the phrase is "pseudo-science" pseudo is a prefix meaning not genuine. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:26:49
Really depends on your definition of fine. I would feel like complete shit if I ate a big mac every day.
@_date: 2018-07-15 17:54:18
Those fucks deserve all of the flak they get and then some. They prey on inexperienced people, and actively spread lies and defraud people.
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:51:30
haha it is anything but a fad
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:36:56
I mean you can already get a Trezor wallet, or a ledger. But most people aren't going to spend the extra money for a hardware wallet, that is unless they have been hacked before.
@_date: 2018-07-09 19:36:03
You are correct, but if we do not work to keep it this way, freedom of information will be a thing of the past. It is simply too threatening to the centralized powers for them not to try and ruin it. *hint hint cough cough net neutrality repeal*
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:26:13
I have never had a single issue buying crypto with my Chase account.... you do know this happened in India right?
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:28:17
Yes, if banks have phone apps, there needs to be a secure way to host a wallet on your phone. Otherwise the convenience factor of the mobile bank apps will make crypto seem archaic and complicated to the layman 
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:34:59
well that made absolutely no sense at all, care to re word it so it does? I'm not sure where you are from, but you have a strange view of America that obviously doesn't come from experience... 
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:00:52
Yes, but unless that is also a harvest moon Macafee will still have to eat his dick
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:57:17
lol the intelligent discussion to idiot meme/shill video ratio is the best market indicator
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:02:41
Do you let hookers and cocaine into your moon base? Cuz I have a star cruiser filled to the brim just waiting for a base to dock in.
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:22:34
All depends on implementation. I would love a chip that would securely store my wallet seed, like a TPM does for your windows key. I could also see it being done poorly, and being a complete disaster.
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:52:22
Riiiight, so you take anecdotal evidence from Reddit of all places and use it to form a view of how you think America works. Get the fuck out of here and go get an education you dumb fuck 
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:35:50
This might me my most anticipated game of all time, looks incredible, and I really do believe CDPR will deliver on their vision

If you work at a sandwich shop and you don't get free sandwiches, you need to find a new job. Restaurants throw out so much food, it is just common decency to let their employees eat it so they don't have to.

not that it really matters to her at all, she doesn't have to worry about being able to afford anything; And I doubt she understands why the tech behind the scenes is getting so much attention.

well I hope you didn't spend much time on this
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:28:59

@_date: 2018-07-30 17:50:22
haha take your upvote, you earned it
@_date: 2018-07-26 18:58:41
haha so you've taken not only snippets from Reddit, but also what you have observed on business trips to form a really educated idea on what living in America must be like. If you can't see how ridiculous and uninformed your opinion is now, you probably never will. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:05:17
Wow nice job pointing out the problems that all first world countries in the West are facing right now, you must be so proud of yourself. Shitty people are not unique to America, I can find these same problems in whatever country you are from. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 19:41:52
How is refusing to regulate getting left behind? Also the FED is a privately held corporation and has no rights to regulate anything except their own internal affairs.
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:52:30
yup, as everyone rushes to try and get a little profit. The worst thing is even my friends who I consider intelligent will only ever talk about it during a run up.  I told people to buy at 6k and they laughed, I literally got a text today from one of those people asking me if I think its too late

@_date: 2019-05-17 22:15:31
The projection is strong with this one hahaha.
@_date: 2019-05-17 21:55:58
He’s an entrepreneur with no technical background trying to fear monger about something he’s not an expert about, and then claiming he’s going to swoop in and save the day with free shit. I see that as corruption.
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:23:40
Honestly I feel like that’s a microcosm for society as a whole
@_date: 2019-05-07 00:59:40
and also the more complicated concepts are over the heads of most people. But yes, the development of good information channels is very important.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:30:05
No reason to be careless though. It's such an easy thing to not share, so why would you? I guess I am a little paranoid, but I would rather be paranoid and still have my keys, than naive and no keys...
@_date: 2019-05-08 23:58:07
Yea it’s not only not possible, but you don’t have the authority to do it. No one does.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:23:25
If you wanted to argue my comment’s content, you should have led with that. Instead you tried to shut down the conversation by making assumptions about my character based on comments in a different sub Reddit. This means that instead of just typing out a response, you went into my comment history looking for dirt. Sad and pathetic behavior.
@_date: 2019-05-04 05:23:06
I agree. I don't agree with that label, I was just trying to point out how meaningless the label is because Joe is for sure on the left.
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:40:58
Yes. A way for people to sell any excess energy they may generate on a p2p network is something I really want to see happen.
@_date: 2019-05-06 21:09:56
He has already publicly stated that he did not stipulate that he had to eat his own balls, so he can contract it out.
He's just going to hire some hoe to do it, and that will be that.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:14:00
I mean you sound pretty delusional. You looked where I have posted in the past and you think me posting there invalidates my point, instead of just being a normal person and arguing the point. Kind of sad that you don’t see the disconnect in your logic, but cognitive dissonance is a bitch ain’t it?
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:33:24
I am going to re iterate the fact that it’s not an email provider, just a client. Spam filtering should be handled on your company’s exchange server. And we have no problems with any of our shared calendars / mailboxes where I work, so maybe yours is configured incorrectly.
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:23:44
it's just a client, and it's pretty good now.

the second one. They call Joe Rogan alt-right. Just a meaningless label for anyone that is out of line with their ideology.

It's just a dumb risk to take for absolutely no reason. I don't turn to the guy sitting next to me on the subway and tell him how much cash I have on me. He can probably guess that I have cash on me, most adults always do, but why would he need to know exactly how much? not much difference here. Just because you are online, that doesn't make you anonymous. Sure, it's unlikely anyone will go after this person for 10 BTC, but it is a definite possibility and there is no reason any of us need to know how much he bought / has.

Delete your account now. You really don’t want to find out what some people are willing to do for 10 BTC.  And welcome to the community, next time you post leave any details OUT

It’s usually used in a commercial exchange setting, I don’t know anyone that uses it for their personal email.
And the company will have an actual spam filter in place. For what it is, Outlook is fine. There are also a lot of things you can do with it that are extremely useful for a company.
But you are correct, it’s not a great client for personal use, I wouldn’t go so far as to say it’s anywhere near as bad as Yahoo though.

That rule isn’t anywhere near as important as the number one rule: never disclose how many btc you hold to anyone for any reason.
