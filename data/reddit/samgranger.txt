LN is overrated.

I actually expected to see a big spike in euro's...
@_date: 2014-04-24 10:33:56
Probably has to do with Chase or whatever bank they're with...
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:54:14
It's a roller coaster, always a gamble. Same with stocks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:29:52
Everything is speculation at the moment.

Extremely bad idea - just like doing dropbox but in the block chain - sure, p2p is possible but you don't want everyone having the same files that are massive clogging up your system.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:20:31
Agreed. Only time will tell... Although it's taking a while....

Since the other comic guy seems rather tied up with his education I decided to attempt my first comic - hope you like it!
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:38:45
Well, I do agree I should contribute to Bitcoin development too bit looking at creating something completely new for this project
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:33:44
In some rare scenarios it can be real easy to calculate the private keys of an address. But you shouldn't have to worry about that.

No disrespect to the OP but he drives an old Toyota. And he might have his paper wallet in a different location. I think it would be more effective to break into everyones house who ever posted in this subreddit &amp; take their pc...

Hey Andreas,
I set up  yesterday (which didn't really kick off unfortunately) but I think it might be better in your hands for this donation thing you're doing - really awesome you're doing this!!
Let me know if you want the domain to combine it with the donations &amp; something cool.
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:48:12
This explains why at the moment: 
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:24:55
Yeah they are still using Gox prices

What better way to introduce your friends to bitcoin whike playing a game of monopoly with real paper wallets! At the end of the game, let the winners keep the paper wallets.

curiosity is consuming me too!
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:53:14
For all you know he lost his private keys ;)
And indeed, why?
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:57:53
A 51% attack can't make you take control of an address you don't own. So again, it won't work.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:01:18
Looks risky as hell

Well, we don't know what will happen to MtGox. Just speculations and panic. So it's a gamble really.... I think? Again, I have no clue what I am doing!

"As of now" != no

You could always self host the web wallet software ;)
@_date: 2014-05-28 13:06:38
Thanks man, will do!
@_date: 2014-03-10 23:28:28
That's actually quite easy to build - are you saying there's non at the moment (I haven't actually looked yet). I'd rather use Python for something like that.
@_date: 2014-05-31 11:33:35
Omg this is awesome, check it out!! Your paper wallet vs my real wallet. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:57:06
I'm not sure dude, I keep zooming and zooming out and I still just see a white screen. Must be a lotta cum!

You do realise that the more popular litecoin gets, the more of a target it will become.

Because you don't automatically know who owns/has created the address it's sent to &amp; Bitcoin transactions cannot be reverted.

A fair bit but not all nitty gritty details.
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:52:22
Succes en veel plezier! From a Brit living in NL :)
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:34:14
I do, I just didn't see the other transactions, silly me not paying attention... ;)
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:07:03
Well, it would seem unfair for me to gain from this if that's what you mean. And if I'd set one up for him, I'm not in the USA so it'd be hard for me passing funds to him incase he doesn't understand Bitcoin - unless someone else here has a good idea? I wouldn't feel comfortable managing donations personally.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:16:10
Going on a manhunt will only make situations worse. Everything is speculation at this moment, remember? And even it this speculation were to be true, still, maybe he can't do anything about it. I'm sure he didn't run off with all these coins. Chill out.

For all you know she's a plus size model haha (nothing wrong with that if you are by the way).
We need more females in the Bitcoin community, enjoy this fun &amp; crazy, but totally awesome currency!

I haven't read anything positive all of today, why not give Mark a little support, he still is obviously working on getting things resolved, even though the messages on MtGox are useless. Negativity never solved anything. And posts like this are making things more tasteless by the second.
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:38:12
Whatever it is, I wonder what effect this news will have on BTC price. Have both the news open in one tab and bitcoinwisdom.com in the other...

I wonder if Autumn Radtke's suicide (2 days ago) had anything to do with MtGox. Anyhow, very sad news.
I hope people will realise that even though they might have lost a lot of money, it doesn't mean it's the end of the world. Money isn't everything.

@_date: 2014-04-18 14:28:39
Partially, yes. However, creating something like this should still be feasible.
For finding people around you, just use something like HTML5's geolocation.
Regarding Bitcoin itself, I'm not sure what the current status is of Coinpunk's wallet but this is something beyond Apple's control.
You can still make a web application that people can add to their homescreen on iOS...

@_date: 2014-05-16 21:29:02
If it does reach $1250, don't sell everything - I'd suggest selling $5000 worth to get your USD investment 'back' if you insist, leaving you with a nice amount of bitcoins that you've earned doing 'nothing'. Then, leave it until you retire - it might be the investment that'll allow you to retire in 5 or 10 years if you're lucky. You're looking at the short term benefits - think bigger (that's how I'd look at it). Good luck &amp; hope your plan works out!!!
@_date: 2014-03-04 12:07:58
How many coins?
@_date: 2015-01-31 12:53:32
Only have experience with Thuisbezorgd here...
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:26:20
There's more to the story, a lot of new people entering the market, but also a lot of people 'daytrading', that have no clue what they are doing. Bitcoin price is pure speculation they say, but people seem to panic sell when prices start dropping. After that, people are very bitter, because they all sold at a loss, so it takes a while for people to start gaining trust, when it comes in the media, "bitcoin above x!!", people then think about joining up again. People don't like red numbers, dropping prices, it's a psychological game...

Not trying to be a whine here, but where can you get a license to include proxima nova in the frontend hosted on your own server?

How much did you deposit? Wouldn't surprise me if they don't have enough coins to pay you... ;)
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:55:29
Thanks - I checked Coinmap but was wondering if there were any other places that aren't mentioned there - maybe small little markets where some merchants accept btc?
@_date: 2015-02-09 10:13:16
When you say questions, would you mean a "I forgot my password - answer these security questions" type of system or no password at all - just questions?

That shouldn't be an issue really, I'd suggest waiting a few more hours - if no reply, make a fresh post on reddit - Since they're US based they should respond to your email shortly - still morning there.

I don't see any information about you guys - under the About section I only see links to social sites. I've never heard of you - who are you, where are you located? Essentially, why should I trust this service? I think that's a pretty important part that you should look at.

Actually, looking at the transactions, it does look like the unconfirmed transaction is the culprit - it will eventually be accepted.
The time it takes for a fee-less transaction to be confirmed can vary vastly. While sometimes you're lucky enough to have it confirmed within the next block (as if you had paid the standard fee), other times it may take days.
This depends on the current transaction volume and miners' level of altruism. Most notably though, it depends on the number of Bitcoin Days Destroyed. Older coins (coming from older transactions) are conventionally assigned higher priority, and thus will generally be included in a block sooner.
As your transaction is pending (unconfirmed), the coins it is spending are getting older and older every day, so the chance of finally getting confirmed is slightly increasing overtime. This should prevent your coins from becoming completely unaccessible, stuck in the void.
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:36:04

There isn't a truly 100% secure online wallet, in the browser, unless it's a chrome web app for example.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:16:40
You could attempt doing a double spend, this time with a fee. But you can't do this within blockchain.info 
@_date: 2015-02-19 11:54:23
Why don't you go ahead and learn how to program?
@_date: 2015-02-16 11:34:35
You still get a clear idea though - this is better than nothing at all!
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:36:40
Already noticed them but indeed, expensive - maybe I'd be better off building something myself then?

"We recently became aware of a hack that purportedly aims to provide security updates to Windows XP customers. The security updates that could be installed are intended for Windows Embedded and Windows Server 2003 customers and do not fully protect Windows XP customers. Windows XP customers also run a significant risk of functionality issues with their machines if they install these updates, as they are not tested against Windows XP. The best way for Windows XP customers to protect their systems is to upgrade to a more modern operating system, like Windows 7 or Windows 8.1."
