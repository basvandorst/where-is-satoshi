Not just illegal for a regulated financial company.  Any company that owes money is obliged to pay that money back, per the terms the creditors agreed to when they loaned the company their money.  Depositors are creditors.  You can't just unilaterally decide to repay only a portion of the debt, that's only a thing under bankruptcy/insolvency.
Paradoxically a regulated deposit-holding company is actually more likely to be permitted to behave this way.  In many countries banking laws allow this sort of thing though only with government sanction and supposedly in the interest of financial stability.

An analogy is passwords.  A password stored on your own home computer (and nowhere else) is unlikely to be stolen, provided you take reasonable security measures, because your own computer is not a particularly tempting target to a hacker unless you're Hilary Clinton.
But your password on a big well-known website (like LinkedIn, Twitter, Yahoo) is much more likely to be stolen, because those websites are tempting targets.

Yes if they sell the tokens, in effect they're accepting the new agreement.
They shouldn't have to though, they're not obliged to accept the tokens as a substitute for the money they're owed.

What about the timing, did bitfinex stop using cold storage for normal funds soonish after receiving this letter ?  If so perhaps they reacted conservatively (from a legal point of view, not a security point of view) and decided not to use cold storage at all, in fear of further regulatory trouble.

Don't store a lot for a long time.  Storing a lot of money in an exchange for a short time (long enough to conduct the trade) is a calculated risk.  Storing a little for a long time doesn't matter.  Storing a lot for a long time is reckless.

Even if you do need an exchange you're not obliged to leave funds on deposit with that exchange for long periods.  Just for as long as it takes to convert, a few days at most.  You should use a private wallet for long term storage.  Hopefully one day we can trust exchanges but not yet.

Proportionality only applies to creditors of equal priority.  In many bankruptcies the secured creditors end up being paid out in part but unsecured creditors get nothing.
Would a deposit-holding company like bitfinex have a significant portion of it's debt held by creditors with higher-priority debt than the deposit holders ?  Perhaps a bank ?
Employee debt also ranks higher than money owed to depositors; would bitfinex have material employee liabilities ?

Imagine in a parallel universe a few generations hence people looking back on compulsory taxation the way we now view rape and pillage, instead groups form to perform a specific social-good project with a life-cycle measured in a few months at most, with a mandate supplied via popular vote and funded entirely by voluntary contributions, via descendants of the current crowd-funding platforms.

"Defined" is essential.  Property rights have to be believed and valued by everybody.  Enforcement depends on widely accepted understanding of and agreement upon property rights.
Plus the "trusted authority" must be held to account.  The rule of law is the key concept here; everybody, including the authorities, is bound by the law. The authorities must themselves respect property rights, and whenever they conspicuously fail to do so (as inevitably happens) democratic or judicial processes must be independent enough and powerful enough to remove them from office expeditiously.

Democracy of the universal-franchise variety that's become so widespread the last couple of centuries (I blame the French) has led to increasing socialism in western countries, for sure.  If every adult vote is equal regardless of individual contribution then the net-takers gradually and inexorably outnumber the net-givers and vote for ever-increasing redistribution.  But as always democracy is held to be the "least worst" political system.  I don't know of anything better.

Yes the Singapore tax authorities appear to deem Bitcoin a "service" thus domestic sales of Bitcoin for SGD attract GST.  The loophole for foreign suppliers seems deliberate.  Bitcoin of course is not a service, services aren't an enduring store of value. Commission on Bitcoin sales could reasonably attract GST, not the Bitcoin itself. Edit - grammar

Assuming it's the same story this guys' supposed crime was structuring, i.e. transferring a largish amount of money in a series of smaller transactions.  This can be done for motives of concealment; smaller transactions may not get the attention from authorities that a single large transaction might.
Of course many people send money in smaller transactions for perfectly legitimate reasons, without any intention of hiding a crime.  The catch is some jurisdictions make the structuring itself a crime subject to forfeiture of the money, even if there's no real crime behind it.

A cautious soul will deposit the minimum btc or $ with an exchange necessary for their purpose, ie. purchase or sale of Bitcoin. Once the deal is done, transfer those funds somewhere safer like a wallet you manage yourself. Because exchanges do not have a great track record, a sad generalisation but true.

It's a new asset (a new currency) but it's not a new class of asset.  It's money.
Any asset can be classed (for tax purposes) as goods (including inventory), fixed assets (eg. vehicles, plant equipment, buildings), rights (including services owed to you), investments or holdings, intangibles (intellectual property, patent rights) receivables (money owed to you), or money that you hold.  Bitcoin is money.

A government controls inflation by authorising the central bank to print more or less money.  This is usually called "setting the interest rate".  When a central bank "lowers the interest rate" that means they are printing more money and loaning it out at a lower interest rate.

In other words bitcoin should be treated as a currency, not as goods or services.  Japan currently treats bitcoin as a commodity for tax purposes.
In just about all countries, when you exchange a currency for a different currency you do not pay sales tax (aka GST/VAT).  Also you do not pay capital gains tax if you hold a foreign currency and it appreciates in value (compared to your national currency.)

The IP routing analogy did nothing for me either.  It wouldn't illuminate anything useful no matter how non-tech-savvy I was.
Scaling is a hot topic and controversial because of what's at stake; making sure Bitcoin stays trustless.  Anyone could design a system that scales beautifully if they abandon trustless.  The article doesn't address this at all.

Tax is why is matters.  Sale of a commodity is subject to sales tax or GST/VAT depending what country you're in.  The tax rate will depend on the country and the "class of goods".  Sale of a currency (i.e. currency exchange) is not subject to this kind of tax.
Purchase and eventual re-sale (ie. holding) of a commodity may be subject to capital gains tax, again depending on the country and the asset class.  Holding a currency is not subject to capital gains tax.

If by violence you mean the threat of being taxed, I don't dwell on it but I feel obliged to understand it.  Seven months ago I sold a bit over 100 BTC and put it towards a deposit on a house.  I'd bought them two years prior to that.  The gain wasn't enormous but enough that I didn't want to pay tax on it, if I could avoid doing so within the law.  I'd bought the BTC in the name of my company because at the time it seemed like a better idea then holding them personally, so I had to do things legitimately in the eyes of my accountant and justify why tax wasn't payable.

A Bitcoin option or swap contract might meet the definition but not Bitcoin itself.  Bitcoin isn't a service nor a debt of service (an obligation to perform a service.)  It's not any kind of right or interest, it's not a "debt of anything"; if you hold Bitcoins nobody is under any obligation to you.  It's simply an asset (a financial asset) that another party may be willing to accept in exchange for goods or services or money in another currency.
Bitcoin is a "foreign currency", that's the only conventional definition that fits.

Companies that operate in competitive markets have the right to refuse to work with whoever they like.  Where there are competing suppliers the customer can go to someone else.
But in most jurisdictions around the world a monopoly provider cannot arbitrarily refuse to service customers.  Naturally not, the customers have nowhere else to go.  Industry regulators enforce this.  It's part of the quid pro quo for granting monopoly rights.
Banks get away with this sort of thing because regulators choose to ignore that banking is an oligopoly.  The ACCC said they "found no evidence" of collusion.  Collusion is intrinsic to the banking industry but regulators close their eyes to it.

Sales jobs are only easy to incentivize when it's easy to tell who made the major contribution to making the sale.  This is usually only true for simple products and services.  Complex, high-value sales often have multiple salespeople each claiming credit supported by hard-working staff who don't get any commission but think they ought.

My customers have extensive experience making payments to Chinese suppliers.  Payments are slow, multiple working days is common.  Poor communication from banks or other payment intermediaries is the standard experience, problems are common.  I suspect you're talking about bank-to-bank settlement, I'm talking about end-to-end.  It doesn't surprise me you work in banking, the patronising attitude you exhibit is also a standard experience.

This comment thread started with: "Here in Europe we are still allowed to use cash... a "value transfer network independent of governmental regulation" allowed for many centuries."
Then other people argued that cash was not viable for large transactions.  My comment was in support of that notion: cash is not practical for large transactions, especially large international transactions.
Wire transfers are of course very much subject to government control and regulation.  Importers and distributors aren't trying to evade the law, but they would like better payment services.  International payments are neither speedy nor reliable.  It can be a very fraught business for a Western company to get payment to a supplier in China.  The government regulations protect the incumbent banks and discourage new players from offering improved payment services.

It's the difference between "possessed and controlled directly by me" vs "owed to me" and that's a big difference.  Confusing the two is natural if you were brought up with the idea that banks are completely trustworthy, and you still assume social and legal forces will ensure these banks and other deposit holding institutions will always unfailingly honour their debts to you.

Good on you for doing this.  For a community college audience you want to simplify this a lot, get out the scissors.  For example the stuff about addresses and ECDSA algorithms etc, much too technical.  "A look at the coin movements" - that's one seriously complicated diagram.  Why blind them with science ?
Emphasise how do I use it, what can I do with it ?  Can I use it to buy stuff; can I buy it and hold it hoping the value will go up; can I use it to send money to a relative in another country.  For these use-cases how does it compare with the more traditional means, how is it better or worse.
"It is thought that" it can act as a store of value - it definitely is a store of value, but naturally the future value is uncertain.  Compared to virtual money which has a physical equivalent (is backed by fiat or gold etc) the big difference is a cryptocurrency isn't "debt money", it's value is entirely in itself, it's not a debt of any physical substance, and it's not fiat currency in another form.
The influence of ISPs isn't that relevant to the future value or security, more important is the influence of banks and regulators.

Indeed.  It's not just Dr Broadbent or the author who don't understand, all the banks and much of the fintech sector seem to be willfully blind to this.  I suspect the trust-less model is impossible for the banking industry to swallow whole.  Because they're built on the opposite concept, a hierarchy of trust.
