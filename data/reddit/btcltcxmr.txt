I still see no reason why litecoin isn't going to continue to follow bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:55:54
Having an opinion makes me an idiot troll? Moron.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:52:51
Any reason you still suck this guys dick after the last 2 elections? He's a known fraud. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 18:03:40
It's just part of their talking points. They haven't signaled for bitcoin hype yet.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:08:09


Bingo. I would be much more thrilled if Hillary was the one accepting bitcoin. Someone with a delusional following fueled by libertarians and conspiracy theorists isn't going to help. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:11:30
No, accolades that have nothing to do with the conversation do not impress me. But I'm sure the gullible Paul supporters such as yourself are amazed. So you sidetrack everything because of a common joke that involves a sexual reference? Grow the fuck up.
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:54:56
You couldn't be more wrong. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:42:06
Suggesting a solution to a problem is being a salesman now? Don't worry, when Monero is $100 a coin and  market cap you will remember this conversation.
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:59:54
Get your money in, make your trade, get your money out. Rinse and repeat. I have used Poloniex and have had a good experience with them so far. 
@_date: 2015-04-05 01:25:20
Yes, but long term hodlers still lost out big. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:53:52
Would never vote for these tools. Funny he accepts bitcoin when his dad says it's not even real money (
Realize a shill when you see one.
I'd rather have Obama for a 3rd term. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:57:32
First of all, it's sad some of you think those things actually correlate with who is elected president. Secondly, I never said I wanted Hillary to be president, I just said it would be better for bitcoin for her to be the one accepting it. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 17:53:58


If you match the sell price with a buy order your coins will sell instantly. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 02:43:54
Lmao. Sounds like you're just butthurt. Where would bitcoin be without the "cockroaches"?
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:21:38
That sub is literally modded by the NSA and consists of 60% shills. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 17:37:37
The creation of Dash was actually the death (last pump and final dump) of the coin. Instaminers are now cashing out. Let the dump continue!
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:54:24
Which has absolutely nothing to do with who is elected president.
@_date: 2015-04-08 00:33:33


I hope you don't actually believe that lol. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:19:23
Way to miss the point. Point is everyone thought Ron Paul was different (aka not a shill). They were wrong, and they will be wrong if they think that about his son. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:22:19
Yes, Ron Paul spent years campaigning for "sound money" at the expense of his supporters only to announce that "bitcoin is not real money" later. If that's not a big fuck you to your supporters then I don't know what is. 
edit: shill at work: 
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:51:33


Paul's Campaign for Liberty was the scammiest campaign ever. Took millions from libertarians looking to put an end to the Fed while fully knowing that nothing would ever happen on his watch. After campaigning for years and accepting countless donations for "sound money", once it actually comes around, he just stands by and proclaims it to not be money at all. So basically a giant lol fuck you, we still want you using fiat. Paul is as much of a shill as Obama or any other candidate. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:43:40
Dude is a joke. Would rather donate fiat to a campaign for Obama's 3rd term. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:37:22
I wouldn't know I don't partake in that debauchery anymore.

Monero solves a "problem" of bitcoins. Bitcoin solves nothing about Monero.

Please explain how XMR is a shitcoin. I would LOVE to hear it!
@_date: 2015-04-01 02:07:40
Your tip won't stop other coins that you don't hold from catching on. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:59:00
Say something useful and I'll respond with an intelligent answer. Until then go back to your libertarian fantasy circle jerk.
Nice failed attempt at cracking a joke btw. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 02:13:44
Stop accusing other people of being pumpers when all you are doing is pumping bitcoin and calling everything else a scam.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:03:21
You sound concerned about my jokes based on sexual references. Do you have some sort of complex?
So he's a Dr. and Senator.....seriously who cares, how is this a point to anything mentioned?
@_date: 2015-04-01 02:46:38
First of all, get a different wallet. Armory and Electrum are suggested. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:35:05
Create an Armory or Electrum offline wallet for your storage if you plan to hold long term. Ledger Nano is another inexpensive option. Not sure about buying bitcoin in UK. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 23:18:05
This. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:27:23
So I take it you missed the hyperbole?
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:40:47
So 3rd or 4th volume of all crypto is laughable? Of course a newer coin isn't going to have the volume and liquidity of bitcoin. That's laughable. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 04:51:17
Then you shouldn't have an issue with XMR. Otherwise stop talking out of your ass.

I forgot, every coin except the one you hold and want to go up in value is a scam.

Newegg actually had a deal $150 off $500 purchase when using bitcoin a while back.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:52:20
Thank you! Can't wait to shift me some XMR! This is big news!

@_date: 2015-03-30 19:24:53
Troll much?
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:25:57
No. Also Monero had a fair launch and Dash was instamined aka a scam.

Yep. Banks are good for bitcon.

Yeah, doge is more like a geo metro.

My guess is 20-40k minimum.

Altcoins won't have to overtake bitcoin to be a success. Stop calling every asset you don't hold a scam.
@_date: 2015-03-29 01:06:29
@_date: 2015-03-27 17:27:20
Do your own research and you will see Monero has a very bright future along with bitcoin.

Ledger Blue when it comes out end of the year.

+1 for Armory
@_date: 2015-03-28 19:52:08
No, that's how bitcoin.org describes it.
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:46:59
Start a business and offer 5% off yourself. Merchant discounts aren't what is going to take bitcoin mainstream. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 22:01:21
It is, can and will be more than just bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-27 04:57:35
Offline generated paper wallet or offline generated wallet such as Armory or Electrum and then write down the seed. Either method is just as effective. Electrum + Tails is very user friendly as someone else suggested. 
@_date: 2015-03-28 16:24:33
Wait a few hours?
