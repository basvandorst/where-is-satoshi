could it be that the clue was "almost open" meaning open is "almost" part of the segment? Just brain storming all possibilities.

You spoke about curves and spirals as tools, something like a fractal spiral?
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:59:01
Yeah. I ended up figuring it out. Thanks!

What was your first step? \(don't have to share\)
@_date: 2018-05-29 13:29:20
It depends what your first step was, lol.

If you wouldn't mind sharing, a clue to how you got to these words? System &amp; two are both outside the white circle.. Maybe I've been incorrect looking only inside?
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:47:32
So does this mean that for example a 24 word seed would have a final checksum word with length of 8?

Yeah I was checking the same. They are definitely not random, they are all coming from the same source.
I have checked references in the WP and there is 1997, 1998 but not 1996 nor 2008. Ideas?
2008: White Paper was published.
1996: NSA publishes paper regarding digital currencies and electronic cash.

The date is not explicitly on the paper, but the one of the referenced papers "hashcash" was published on 1 August 2002 \- 20020801.  
The response 00212121 seems to be a transaction from a wallet that also payed the prize wallet the 1BTC.  
Wallet X \-\&gt; 1 BTC to the price wallet.  
Wallet X \-\&gt; 0.00212121BTC to a separate wallet.
Perhaps a consolation prize?

perhaps a clue for us to know if we're headed in the right direction? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:49:42
Mind sharing where / how you found that? \(no worries if you'd rather not share yet\)

Why bip49?
@_date: 2018-05-29 11:29:26
True.. I don't want the answer given to me. Where is the fun in that? I am fitting the spirals to the words above, although I think it will take me some time to find the insight. Good luck! Together we struggle and wait.
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:37:04
some context?
@_date: 2018-06-16 20:31:23
There was another puzzle which in my opinion was loads of fun. It was made by Zd3n and was for the Codex Protocol. It has been solved now, though. :)
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:22:50
The last very popular puzzle took 5 years to solve. This has only been out for 2 weeks! :D
@_date: 2018-07-18 14:21:11
Source? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:07:52
Thanks! Gives me chills seeing those graphs :)
