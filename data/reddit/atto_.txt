I say we use irn-bru bottle lids, fallout style.

It is now.
Might need to check it out, it's a bit out of they way though, hmm..

You know what's better than 4-factor auth?

Damn, I'm in the market for a VPS, shame they're hosted in the USA though. Need one in central Europe.

No iPad for OP.

Yeah to be honest I'd be less sceptical if it wasn't a brand new reddit account with only this post.

Fuck off.

Could your laser engraver work on something like brushed aluminium? Because then you'd have me interested.
Also I think you might need to add more white space around the edge of the code, I had trouble scanning it with a few apps, but maybe that's because I'm pointing at a screen.

Nice try OP.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:09:51
Whoa, you should become like a trader or something that's genius.

Eeeh, the comment you replied to is a reference to an AskReddit thread yesterday. I doubt they were being serious.

Obligatory 'put a \ before the first one for it to show.'
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:07:01
It's US only, maybe that's the issue?
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:46:52
Yep, but you can only send then to people who follow you. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:13:53
Didn't hear anything about that, got a link?

Your post is bad...so I'm downvoting, does that make me part of the 'herd'?
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:44:09
Yes.
