One thing: While bitcoin is crashing along with all the other cryptos , bitcoin is the only one which is currently UNUSABLE as a currency, my point: If you have for example $20 in a wallet you have to pay a fee of $8 to move your money to a different wallet. So if you wanted to use bitcoin, you know as a currency, and buy an item for $12 , it would cost you in fact $20, and it would take about 2 hours (if you are VERY lucky) for the transaction to be confirmed. Add to that the the price of btc just lost 50% of its value and it isnt pretty.   
Now , the alts losing 30%-40% as well, but then you can actually move your money to a wallet /exchange  QUICK and for cents as FEE , so you can essentially buy an item for what it actually cost or hell, even sell your crypto. 
People trying to sell bitcoin right now cant even do that because they either pay the high fee or wait hours to get their money to an exchange , all while btc crashes.   
So my point is: while all cryptos are crashing , only bitcoin is unusable . Please argue that&lt;

the trend is down, why dont you newbs open a short position with a stop loss and a take profit and make some money on this crash? I made a couple grand but some people are literally making millions why you guys hold onto .05 bitcoins thinking you will be rich one day lol

That would be cool you know, if bitcoin was usable as a currency like in the past. Last time I tried to move $20 worth of bitcoin to make a payment it would have costed me $13 as the fee, and an average of 3 hours to complete the transaction.   
I am not entirely sure^about what the fee and transaction times are right now, as I just have all my btc in an exchange atm, and wont move it anymore, but I would assume it is still the same garbage as I havent seen any fix announced anywhere. Correct me if I am wrong.

do you guys understand how pathetic it sounds to everybody older than 12 reading this when you write stuff like "weak hands" ?

it´s not over yet but its getting there. At this point you can make a lot of money shorting it using CDF instruments. I have tripled my account in the last 3 days, posted a couple comments here in reddit tho but nothing specific and I wont be , but I would only suggest to be very careful if you want to trade, I suspect while the bubble pops a few exchanges will suddenly pull an mtgox kinda excuse and freeze withdrawals, remember some of them are doing insider trading and , some of these exchanges in particular those offering leverage might be really losing a LOT of money, including their customer´s money as they are not regulated (some /most). 
Thats why , while this is happening I personally would be very careful sending any cash/usd to an exchange; but if you have btc or other crypts  you can use that to short btc instead of using actual cash&lt;&lt;hope that helps somebody.

Fee to transfer $20 worth of bitcoin during last month from one wallet to another  = $26

Ha, this was exactly my point. You called me a troll because you dont like me stating a fact: bitcoin crashed and lost a huge amount of value in the last few days.   
If that makes me a troll in your book then hey yes I am a troll, nice to meet you.     
If anything I would say the ones trolling here are those screaming "FUDFUDFUD ; LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE!!!" and dumb stuff like that, it just makes you look childish tbh.

The fact that bitcoin once was $10 , $100 or $1000 doesnt change the fact that it experienced a crash in the last few days. There isnt really anything wrong about the term. You dont see bloomberg analysts telling people after a 3% crash in the DOW JONES hey guys totes dont worry! Remember when it was worth only 8k points??    
It looks like you need to need to calm down; I am just pointing out facts here and you went full emotion calling me names and insulting, pretty sad child tbh.

It is a crash. It is what we call it in the finance world when an assets loses 30% of its value in 3 days. "A severe correction" is a term kids in bitcoin-land came up with to sugar-coat a real term used in finance for this exact scenario.

I think a lot of people would probably buy again at around $500 like last time after the big crash.   
Anything above 1000 is really just investors gambling, most of the kids here cant afford to buy a single bitcoin so they buy 0.0002 and think they will get rich with that by HODLING forever. Pipe dream but whatever, some people believe in religion, some in bitcoin.
