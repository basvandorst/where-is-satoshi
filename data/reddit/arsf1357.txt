Ethereum did not "fork" Counterparty. They rewrote the whole concept in like 350 lines code. Counterparty however did for fork Ethereum, sort of.  This demonstrated how something complex can be reimplemented on top of ethereum fairly simply, and how porting things over to Counterparty has lots of issues and is not scalable.

You're simply wrong. 
Satoshi left bitcoin turing-incomplete for reasons of his own, but he did hint that one day there will be a full turing-complete blockchain. 
Give this a read first. 
You really need to do your homework before yapping out of your ass buddy. You do know who Szabo is right? 
"Ethereum has vast potential, whereas Bitcoin won't ever **do anything well beyond implementing a currency**  programmer Nick Szabo, another early Bitcoin proponent who's recently begun tweeting after an extended absence from the internet, told us in an email several weeks ago."

37000 was all voluntary. No one held a gun to my head and said "purchase Ethers or I will shoot".  I purchased them because  I believe in the project and I want to support them. If you don't share the same sentiment, you simply don't contribute. There is no need to get mad and call people names!  We are all big boys, we can take care of ourselves. No old grandma's here to be taken advantage of. 
Secondly, you simply can NOT use bitcoin. I want you think long and hard about why it is not possible to use bitcoin. It should be fairly obvious.

This, in my opinion, is the main reason  why the price is going down. Every time a big company teams with bitpay or coinbase the price has gone down.  Not to say I'm not happy about the adoption but do not think the price is going to shoot up since MS is now accepting Bitcoin for Xbox. Price will gradually go down until Spain or some other country decides to pull a Cyprus. That's when you need to pull out your moon boots

If you're an investor and you placed all of your eggs in the ethereum basket then you will have a bad time! If not in this venture, then the next. But to give some devs some money so they can work on a project full-time is not such a crazy idea. Invest what you can afford to lose. What this does however, is pave the way for a better quality product at the end since it's not a side job for 3 people , but a full time job for group of 15. Depending on The complexity of a project, do you agree that 3 people working part-time on that project will have a less desirable outcome than if those same 3 people worked full-time, plus had help from 12 other full-time employees ? I would argue yes.

So, my cousin is an independent film maker in London who happens to have a Ph.D in mathematics. Long story short, he came to the US for some film festival a few months back and he stayed with me for a few days. I asked him about bitcoin, and to my surprise he said didn't know much about it. As a true bit-head I gave him the basic spiel and needless to say, he was pretty skeptical. Anyway I gave him a few bits and printed the satoshi paper for him so he can read it on the plane ride back. I didn't hear much after that from him except a few hello how are yas on skype. A few days ago, he skypes  me and says:

I figured I don't really need to. Most people have a  brain, so they understand its a picture from a mirror and its going to appears backwards. If you have  ocd or some other disorder then I'm sorry.
