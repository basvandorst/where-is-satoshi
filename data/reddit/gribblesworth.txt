Isn't the minimum fee for Fidor -&gt; Kraken GBP SEPA transfers £10 though? Or can you just use the euro funding option?

You can pay into a paper wallet, can't you? All you're doing is controlling access to the private key, rather than actually storing funds (and payments are just made to your public address). Everything is, after all, recorded on the blockchain. You *could* spend from it too, but that would be very dangerous from a security perspective, as it'd be like using your debit card with the pin written on it.

Unless you have a UK-based exchange with a UK bank account, then no, as there's no incoming SEPA/IBAN support.
It's incredibly difficult for a new bank to gain these mechanisms, as they are carefully controlled within the banking industry, as far as I can tell. Not sure about any alternatives, as all new players will be in the same boat.

UK. As I understand it, German/EUR accounts are smooth sailing, not so for the UK arm.

Fidor have no incoming SEPA support, no IBAN, so although getting money to Kraken is simple (via EUR anyway), getting it back isn't currently possible, sadly.

Remember, it's a UK-specific post. :)

I don't really know for sure if there are any further repercussions from doing this, but it's difficult to imagine any bank you turn to not wondering where you got the money from.
Might be worth looking into somewhere that would let you open a EUR account, as this seems to sidestep the restrictions on UK SEPA for new fintech businesses. Seems to be what Fire.com have done, though I've only just learned of them myself. As you might expect with a name like that, Googling user experiences with them is difficult.

"We do not provide our Services to businesses or support transactions which involve: bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies."
Shame, that could have been handy.
So fed up with UK banking either dragging their heels or blocking other crypto-friendly banks who want to move forward.
Fidor's great, but they're basically at the mercy of the UK banking old boys' club when it comes to getting an IBAN.
