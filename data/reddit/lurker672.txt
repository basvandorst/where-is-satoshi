Your historical retorts are  hillarious. Touche sir. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:03:20
Because he's socially cleansing poor people by canceling medical aid/ raising insurance premiums and ostracising the foreign community? You must be a cunt ��

January dip! Everything will rise in time (just depends how long) 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:07:33
Mightn't be done dipping :(
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:51:00
I'd say hell yes, I reli don't see it going under 10k, just my 2cents tho! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:13:35
This is the same paper that says nearly EVERYDAY that "we are on the brink of ww3" because of basically anything.  sensationalist scaremongering, can't stand it. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:18:35
That was great haha. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:20:54
Wasted on this rabble my good Sir. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:21:05
Yeah I agree, but you can tell for yourself by looking at previous pumps of a group and seeing if there's a "pre-pump" if not then it's a good group :) and you SHOULD check, for sure. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:22:34
The crash was worth it for this post haha v good, godammit becky. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:50:21
Congrats bro :) I wanted to buy more of that sweet special offer shiz but no more fiat to comfortably invest :/  
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:18:16
I didn't mention death squads? I thought the average trump supporter couldn't read and Hey ho I was right �� guess what, I don't pay for health insurance in my superior non racist country (Hah) ;p GL with the pussy grabber ����
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:28:00
Thanks for the reply. You think that's the bubble burst then now the herds in? Just curious as to what you think, I'll be re-evaluating by the end of the year.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:59:39
What prompted you to short? 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:25:08
The express is a terrible source no need to worry lol
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:40:53
GRARAR Smells like manflesh! 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:54:44
I can get you an invite to the one I use if you like? 180k users. I messed up the first one and lost a little but made 50% on the second pump :) 
Anyone Pm me if you are interested. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:56:39
Haha no worries. 
Edit: I believe you meant no thanks ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:59:37
Thought I was the only one here using CF! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:47:12
Fucking hell that's good. Proper laughed there lol 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:57
Hmm yes, the esteemed gentleman is correct. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:54:17
Global market cap is 100 trillion fyi. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:14:19
A whole post about me, why thank you sir &lt;3. I'm fairly involved as is though, thx ✌️
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:15:43
You just ruined BTC for me :( 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:56
Throw some iota into that mix bruh! Maybe a sprinkle of ripple too? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:07:11
He's dreaming if he thinks it's recoverable, marinating in concentrated bin juice for years. Itl be fucked :/ poor dude (literally xD) lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:36:30
That is amazing :) merry fucking Christmas indeed :D 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:21:12
Like that welsh dude xD (~£78 million) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:30:34
The stress in this thread is unreal, chill.

'A professional torturer' damn man what country do you live in? I never want to go there...
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:39:15
Cult is the right word....now bow! To your bitcoin GODS! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:47:09
It has been lying in a corrosive juice for the last few years - it is an old HD so probably not waterproof or airtight platters will have been washed clean (although it will not be clean lol) and rusted too, unless they're glass which as it's an old HD I doubt. landfills are acidic as hell. 
Edit: not trying to be confrontational just woken up. ✌️
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:14:08
Id be exactly the same. Think of it this way, you would have never known about BTC if you weren't buying weed or w/e so you wouldnt have ever had it in the first place. Plus most people would probably sell  once it's ten times the price you paid! Stay strong brother :) 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:21:07
It isn't though :( it was in a laptop and he took it out to look after BTC when he was getting rid of laptop, then forgot and threw it out xD poor guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:22:37
Can't predict the future bro, don't beat yourself up. 
Edit: typo 
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:36:18
It won't be. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:52:31
Bernie should have been made king of America (lol) or just come over and run the UK for us. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:17:18
A fellow Londoner! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:04:37
It'll certainly be a good day :p 
Very sensible! You too bud glad I was of assistance. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:36:34
Not so good for smaller amounts then :/ sorry man! The transfer costs and £5 are negligible  to me rn works out around .8% for me. 
It is such a ballache trust me xD I have looked at so many places...a lot are good but have tiny limits... Go get a cup of tea :) I've been managing my crypto stress with chocolate pudding :p oh and Doom, something about slaughtering demons helps... Haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:57:13
He is completely insane though haha. 
Ps let's hope he's right ;D 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:08
Call me a zealot (which I'm not) but I don't think a substantial dip is coming. Too many new people jumping onboard all with the expectation of waiting a few years before cashing out. This is literally blast off imo. 
Edit: Omfg look at the sell orders!! THERE ARE NONE!
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:29:14
*whut you talking 'bout Willis?*
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:10:10
Seriously? Damn that's optimistic, here's hoping :D 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:43:44
Slow for a lot of coins rn, does seem to happen eventually though. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:20:27
RemindMe! 1 week 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:14:11
Underrated comment too xD 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:02:17
Agreed it's madness. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:55:31
Hey man I reckon your best bet is electrum for small amounts until you get your ledger or w/e that's what I did ^^ 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:45:18
Is this just fantasy? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:08:08
Haha excellent! Eve is awesome, got into it about a year ago started a corp got 40 members, didn't know wtf I was doing then had some random corp member get us into 4 different wars, GG haha. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:09:21
That genuinely made me laugh. So much truth :p 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:07:53
"Fam" - fellow Londoner? Manling is epic btw ✌️ 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:52:56
Hardware wallets are super easy and have a step by step process, you will be fine honestly they are your best option, I have a nano ledger S and can't reccomend it enough. Never buy them from Amazon or eBay ONLY from their own website direct from the factory. If you get someone else to set your crypto up for you they might rob you down the line (srsly) good luck! 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:54:26
This is basically what will happen, at least in America. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:23:40
Madness bro! It's dipped from 11.4 to 10.5 on bitfinex, I think that's as big a dip as we'll see for a while! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:24:51
Hah, you will die of dehydration then son! Your cup must be very empty indeed to be so bitter ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:07:57
This is pretty huge is it not? Have they not been without legit banking for ~6 months? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:59:45
Impossible to know bud! What you go into? I'm in BTC, ETH and iota recently bought some XRP too!
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:50:47
Ahhh I thought it was a Londoner thing! Now I know :p 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:49:36
Haha whatever works bud :D 
They do unfortunately, they charge the same as yours £9.50. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:27:41
Oh sheeettttt must buy more BTC!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:37:29
Strong, the sarcasm is with this one. Touche. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:56:52
Heh, me the other day. ��
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:05:53
Hey man you looked at coinfloor? As far as I can see it's cheaper and directly takes GBP! £5 flat deposit then .38%/ same to withdraw. There's no trading fee either! So compared to CBs 1.5% trading fee it should be half the cost or so! It's hard in the UK to crypto.. I'm with Halifax btw ✌️ 
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:46:26
Refined military grade highly compressed liquid anti-FUD. Let's have some moar :D

@_date: 2018-02-10 18:20:07
Well, yeah. I wouldn't live in the US. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:18:39
Couldn't agree more bud, that said.. I like a bit of a gamble :p bought 1.4 coins at ~$3800 here's hoping it goes to a zillion billion dollars a coin. Lol. If not fuck it. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:28:47
Bitcoins response to FUD-Ers. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:15:33
Yes please ^^ sounds interesting. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 08:07:56
The more complicated the better :D thx for your opinion though! 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:29:55
Yup, all about that tangle. iot will obviously be huge = iota huge. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:11:13
We're in the same boat Op! GL :D 
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:04:36
Wouldn't it be great if it were that simple. Trying to ascertain if I should invest more in BTC, ETH or IOTA. Recently bought into all 3. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 23:49:24
That's a fiery burn! Ouch! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:01:13
Yup, also agree. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:29:08
Roll the dice baby lol 
@_date: 2017-09-26 22:32:55
That seems ridiculously high, can you outline why you think this please? Smells like bs. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:37:52
Lol it probably wasn't, doubt Domino's/pizza hut woulda accepted it xD and yes I am insinuating all other pizzas pail in comparison!! Wanna fight about it?!?! 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:04:38
At least! 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:18:09
Yeah I'm not so sure haha. Might just halve my meagre stash  and put the rest into ETH or iota. Would like to keep a little BTC though. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:19:30
Great article, want moar BTC!!! 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:33:28
Sorry, I only listen to wizwazzle :/ 
Whatever tf he/she/that is :p 
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:41:15

@_date: 2017-10-21 09:53:46
So why the huge value spike? 
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:40:16
Where do you get off spelling Mum, 'Mom' sounds like you already have a mouth full of something (Pizza I HOPE) MOMMOMOMOMOM. Doesn't even sound gormet sir!! We have a 'Papa Johns' and I'll admit....THEY ARE GOOD. But they're no Milano Domino's!  I'm glad I've struck a nerve with you sir, you're just another_one of those  neigh-sayers! En garde!
