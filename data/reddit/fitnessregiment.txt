So you're saying we won't need that upload bandwidth? Could someone make a chart of what we will need to be running nodes so we can be prepared?
@_date: 2015-06-08 19:53:56
they get like 2,100+ Bitcoins per month from that mine though.... That's pretty crazy amount
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:09:27
heh cause I am a resident of like 4 countries so I'd love to just sell it in the one with least taxes as long as that is 100% legal. I don't want to be hit with some stupid tax if I end up selling like 100 - 200 BTC.
@_date: 2015-06-08 06:38:40
We don't know, if we did we'd all put all our $s into bitcoin obviously.
@_date: 2015-06-23 07:53:30
Damn that's a lot of transactions... 109.2mb/s upload we will need by 2036? That's easily feasible since multi-gigabit will most likely be the standard by then.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:47:26
And what is a realistic amount of time needed? Because 2 gigabit upload is a lot even for 2036.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:00:45
how do they check how long you've held it?
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:33:02
but what if I changed wallets, transferred them over to different wallets and finally transferred them to a final wallet for sale?
@_date: 2015-05-23 23:07:55
Would the defense that they don't understand much english work? Out of curiosity haha.
Is there some type of law that protects non-native speakers or mentally deficient from signed contracts? I mean if I get some chinese guy to sign a contract saying he'll give me 10,000 a month, surely that's not legal.

Not only that but the diseases can mutate inside the carrier.
So let's say Disease A 1 person isn't vaccinated and 100000 are.
Person 1 gets the disease, it mutates, now all 100000 can catch it.

Ironically my great grand father served in the army over there.

and using drugs isn't?

We have removed survival of the fittest on purpose. Because it's a brutal unhuman way to live. With it we no longer have scientists, we just have soldiers, we will no longer advance technologically, we will just kill each other and survive that's it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:49:11
unless you are extremely fit / smart you will most likely be one of the first to die.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:19:00
of course we can do whatever we want to you, wtf do you think the government is for.
Are you saying I can go rape my room mate and then cut her into pieces with no repercussions because I think it's ok?
@_date: 2015-05-23 20:24:53
dude I don't know anyone in real life that even knows what CPUs/GPUs are for and what they do or how they handle tasks. They don't even know what RAM is nor what the difference between an SSD and HDD is.
Most people have no idea what technology is, they just use the shiny screen in front of them.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:32:22
Simple: You don't vaccinate, don't be part of our society.
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:01:08
what? Cartels exist to make money. Businesses would be the new cartels.
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:27:22
agreed. Whole thread is getting downvoted here, this is bull
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:45:29
? They can use government services. Oh like for example they can go get vaccinated.
Why would we let them endanger us?
Do you let terrorists use government services?
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:57:36
wat. 
Ok let me say this. If you let me do whatever I want. GL m8. I need rules. I know others do too.
Even with rules people break them, allow people to drive drunk holy shitballs the streets will be filled with the dead.
Allow people to kill holy fuck you think america has a violence problem now? wait till cartels start shooting up neighborhoods and gunning down cities.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:17:44
you're the special kind of stupid aren't you.
A money grab? Don't know what barbaric country you come from but in most of Europe the government loses money from vaccines since they are free.
Don't work? Wot get me data.
Want to know why we get sick even if we vaccinate? BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T VACCINATE. Vaccinating only protects you against the old virus. IF someone gets sick with the old virus, it will change inside them. THIS will then infect people who vaccinate. If everyone vaccinated no one would ever catch these. But if 1 person doesn't vaccinate, and 1000000000 do. They can still all get sick from that 1 persons mutated bullshit.

To be honest I read the emails and I think both of them are morons. But I am probably missing a huge part of the story.
As far as I can tell, OKCoin stupidly agreed to pay 10,000$/month for a domain that really isn't worth it. And this Roger dude thinks that he is entitled to half a million because he's domain squatting, while pretending to want to help the "community".
I don't see him donating the 35k he's made so far, he's doing this for his own gain, and OKCoin was stupid to sign it.
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:43:51
because every day people lose their keys.
@_date: 2015-05-13 17:55:57
1. I said they are free, not free to produce. The government absorbs all the costs, they LOSE money. How is that a money grab please explain
2. Who said anything about being afraid? I logically want to be protected against diseases that could potentially spread/cause a major crisis both economically and kill tens of thousands of people. Heard of small pox?
3. What the fuck are you talking about. Are you serious right now? There were at MOST 500,000,000 people around in the past, we have over 7,300,000,000 right now. 14 Times more... Ofc diseases spread faster. You think people in the past were as close as we are now in nice warm offices sitting huddled up to each other? No in the past they were in a fucking ice age, no shit there were barely any diseases
4. You must be very uneducated. Vaccines do not MAKE you healthy, no one has ever said that. They just protect you from getting certain ilnesses that are dangerous. No one vaccinates against everything, we just vaccinate against potential threats. Like for example getting fucking tetanus. No I do not want to lose my arms because of a cut. Yes I did nearly get it from being stabbed by a rusty scissor when I was 4 years late for a vaccination.
5. Notice how most oubreaks come from 3rd world countries where they don't have vaccines. And then the CDC comes and gives them vaccines. And then the disease is gone? THey don't give them clean water they give them vaccines.

even with robots that's a typo, he obviously meant millions.

@_date: 2015-05-13 17:29:33
I really really really really hope you are joking right now.
I am as free as I want to be.
I do NOT want to be allowed to drive drunk, I do NOT want to be allowed to kill, steal, not vaccinate, harm others, lie in court, anything.
I agree with most laws, I do agree that in many ways the system is broken but I totally understand why it is there.
Remove the system and you will have complete anarchy.
Want to know what happens when people are free? Go visit Syria. If you allow people to be fully free, the countries will collapse.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:47:41
yea I agree cops in the US don't seem to be too helpful either.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:13:49
was gonna buy a gopro but that's good too.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:43:14
I can't find anywhere to buy Amazon.co.uk gift cards that seems trust worthy.
If there is I'll buy thousands worth.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:20:30
I am and I do believe in bitcoin, but I do see more use for myself for liquid money right now. I will come back to bitcoin in the future, and I will continue supporting it and spreading it on my sites/channels etc...
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:34:56
it's a nice saying but it's not true.. if there is another spike within next year that hits high (500$) or so I'll probably sell.
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:17:59
yea I know but this is a brand new laptop and I double authenticated it, I already sent the BTC to 
It's a good one right?
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:18:02
I was thinking of cold storing like 10 BTC but can't decide yet.
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:21:45
I need .co.uk as I'm not in the US 
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:46:32
NOOOOOOO my amazon recommended list... oh god no... family account
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:18:31
is this 
2 authentication on brand new laptop for 1 month safe?
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:27:47
well it took like 30seconds so
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:11:54
To be honest I'm not happy with the price right now just because a lot of people are holding because of the worth they lost, I hope it spikes once more and crashes a little higher (350-450$)s
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:01:39
I don't see how I could get compromised as I don't plan on keeping them for long and don't go on any weird sites and no one knows my email etc.
@_date: 2015-02-18 22:20:45
Thanks for the tip
