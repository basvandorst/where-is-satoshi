Is Warren Buffet very knowledgeable about asset management, stocks, etc...? Yes. Very
But clearly, he doesn't understand shit about BTC. All he sees is BTC as a unit. 
No, BTC as a unit has no intrinsic value. But when you buy a BTC, you are investing in a piece of the technology. That is its value. Shame he doesn't understand. More for us, I guess.

I know a lot of people are doing it to get rich quick. I bought my first coins at the end of 2012 and I saw it as an investment.
I understand people say it's "not about the price," but for me it is. I think the technology is revolutionary and I am *also* passionate about its implications, but it's still about the price to me in some ways.
I'm not trying to get rich quick, so saying "People who think it's about the price are just trying to get rich quick" isn't fair.

This is correct. I remember listening to a talk with Andreas and he was mentioning there have been around 5-6 different sea changes in payment technologies in human history. I think it went something like:
1. Bartering (quid pro quo)
2. Items for services (whiskey, sea shells)
3. Metals (gold and silver)
4. Notes pegged to metals
5. Notes (fiat) themselves
6. Credit cards
I don't know if I'm 100% accurate on those paradigm shifts.

um, both the pharmaceutical industry and Social Security became mainstream because of the government. You would not have them had it not been for the government.
MinersFolly - his argument had nothing to do with success or failure. Something being mainstream is not a cause of success; it's usually only an association. 
edit: Government needs to be involved (at least *some* sort of stance) in technological systems before becoming mainstream. Railroads, telephones, internet...Bitcoin. It's no different.
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:40:20
I think the most important reason (which the article did not touch on) is simply that there is a stark digital divide between White, middle-upper class Americans and other marginalized ethnicities. 
BTC runs fundamentally on new tech, tech that has a pretty steep learning curve...whether we want to believe it or not. Statistically speaking, African Americans have lower incomes to pay for tech, lower access to tech, and less education of tech. 
As everyone usually points out at some point, BTC needs a killer app that lessens this learning curve, makes it easier to access, and requires less education to understand (or something that increases availability of BTC education) 
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:58:57
But why would BTC be any more useful? Would it simply be because of greater speed of transmission? 
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:33:12
Dude. Again. This has nothing to do about "success" or "trust." 
The fact of the matter is that government intervention will speed adoption, normalize usage, and mainstream Bitcoin's awareness. 
For better or for worse. Never once did I say that government intervention is good. Don't make an argument where there's not. 
Barring any doomsday scenarios, the people will need the government to help them understand and use Bitcoin. Most people (think of lower class people with low education) don't have the intellectual fortitude to understand and use Bitcoin. The digital divide is real and the free market will not close that gap. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:10:28
well done. definitely comforting
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:31:44

Forgive my ignorance, but how does one false signal a node? If you're running the software, isn't that your signal?
@_date: 2017-03-03 15:48:38
I'm not so sure about this. What if it's already priced in? At least in the short term 
@_date: 2017-03-20 14:50:01
So what happens if you want to send coins? Which chain do they go on? Does it depend on what software the nodes are running?
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:17:22
thank you for this. I have a decent number of bitcoins I keep on a hardware wallet. Keep everything very safe. 
I don't plan on spending them in the short-term whatsoever. Realistically not even for 10 years. 
So what you're saying is that as long as I keep them safe and chill for a while, I should be OK? I don't have to worry about losing any sort of opportunity to have them be on the right chain?
@_date: 2014-10-10 03:42:48
skimmed this title and read it as "Masturbating to Bitcoin"
already a master
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:59:38
So it's basically an approximation? Do we know the percentage of nodes that are anonymous, or is that not known 
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:47:02
So what is the significance in signaling to begin with? And how does someone signal exactly?
@_date: 2017-03-20 16:10:17
So if people have access to both coins, can people technically profit from dumping one? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:19:23
I have some BTC saved up. So if they hard fork, my coins remain BTC, not BTU right? 
edit: Can you explain why the vast majority of nodes would reject the BTU blocks? Is it because there are more nodes rejecting BTU than the miners?

Told me about the Silk Road, mentioned Bitcoin, and the rest was history. 
(No I didn't not use the Silk Road. I found Bitcoin way more enticing)
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:37:17
great response. Although I'm wondering if there are any from history that have already come to a resolution of some sort
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:23:48
ahh I see. From what it seems, though, BTU is quite unlikely to last. That would mean with strong likelihood, that BTU will probably be the dead one.
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:54:33
Ok interesting! But what is the utility of signaling in the first place if it's known to not trust it? Bitcoin as a system is pretty resilient, so why do people listen to this?
@_date: 2017-01-29 03:06:09




not necessarily true. A business with a print-out QR code could still receive the transaction. Granted, it would be harder to verify/know if consumer has enough funds. But still, it's possible
@_date: 2017-08-04 00:25:10
Yes, I realize I made an idiot mistake and yes, 90 days is a long time and BCH will likely be worth pennies.
edit: I offered to pay one of the devs to recover them quickly. Will update. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:21:54
I sent my BCC to an XBT address associated to my account. They must have the private keys for this address, right? How do I get it back?
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:52:50
Hey dude - I know it's not coinbase but I did the same thing with Kraken. They said that if you sent BCH to a BTC address they will not be liable for recovering them.
I emailed Kraken a very nice (almost pitiful) email about how sad I was for making such a stupid mistake. They've been really good about support and I finally got [this]( today.
It's 90 fucking days but it's still better than nothing. I was expecting they'd just blow me off. Still, it's quicker than Coinbase :) so hopefully there will still be some worth in BCH so I can dump the coins.
Good luck, man!
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:42:48
already done. I guess I just gotta be patient. Thanks for the reassurance that they have the coins!
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:25:22
how does that help me get access to the original coins, though...?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:22:52
I sent my BCH to my XBT address accidentally before knowing they weren't accepting BCH deposits. What happens to these coins? They must have the private keys for them, right? 
My transactions shows confirmation and my coins are just sitting there...
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:10:37
kanye west fidget spinner worth 21 btc tbh. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:10:40
It's easy to think that - it's kinda confusing. Basically when the hard fork happens, the block chain splits into two. So if you have an address, AJE120dk7, for example, the fork makes two of these addresses. Let's say Coinbase has that address. After the fork, there is an address that's AJE120dk7 for both BTC and BCH. that means they have the private keys for both addresses. 
I might be a little off in my explanation but I DO know that they own the private keys for both addresses and surely have access. 100%. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:51:14
Of *course* its 21% off today because I just bought one at full price yesterday to claim my BTG.

I was in my high school media class, 2012, talking to a buddy. I was a senior, but his older brother was in college. He mentioned that you could buy drugs online through this thing called the deep web.
He proceeded to tell me about onion sites and that the currency used to pay for the transactions was in bitcoin.
It was down the rabbit hole from there (I don't do drugs, but I found it fascinating).
It took me a whole year to buy my first bitcoin....January of 2013. Close enough to 2012.
I just hit the 21 club a couple months ago, after almost 4 years of buying. It feels pretty damn good.
