If bitcoin is truly decentralized than this fact shouldn't matter right?
It should be resilient enough to resist an attack.

Enlighten me.  I'm trying to have a dialogue with you.
When you have a small amount of people owning a majority of any currency, places like Bitpay will happen every time.  The only way to prevent that is if the wealth is distributed to the point that whenever a place like Bitpay pops up, several competitors can form immediately.
If that's incorrect please tell me why.  Waving your hand at a vague argument my saying I'm missing the point isn't helping me.  Articulate your point more clearly or address mine.

Just as long as we are clear here, you think consumers are rational?
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:35:33
Yes that correlation of higher price=higher adoption is exactly what makes Bitcoin unique.
It's a technology that's used as a currency, but it's price acts like a stock.
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:33:39
The same argument applies to minimum wage.
Minimum wage is meant to increase quality of life.
Paid vacation time is meant to increase quality of life.
I can tell though, that politically you and I will disagree on every point so I don't see any reason to carry on.
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:57:15
930 or so  people own over half the bitcoins.  It's not like it was "decentralized" before now.

Nope, you can't look at it like that.  Every 50 cents you make is 50 cents you didn't have before.

When it says % ownership on the side it leaves me wondering what their metric for measuring airplane use is though.
Does flying commercial one time count?  If it does then I can believe the near 100% bit.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:04:10
Where do I say that I'm being selfless?
It's absolutely a selfish stance to say that I want paid vacation.  Quality of life IS a selfish stance.  I want a better quality of life at the cost of rich people who can very well fucking afford to give a better quality of life to people.
If you expect me to have sympathy for someone that makes 10 million dollars to have to ONLY make 8 million dollars, then you won't find it here.

Because several of the people that are in the group owning over 50% of the coins have identified themselves.
There wouldn't be any way of knowing if they got all the coins obviously, but if their bank account started to get fat or if they bought some new stuff it would be pretty obvious.
@_date: 2014-01-18 03:27:30
No, technically the supply is the amount of coins that people are willing to sell.  That's it.  Not the amount of coins made, not the amount of coins currently held.  The amount of coins that are for sale is the supply.
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:48:08

Technically yes you have partial ownership of the supply of nerf guns.
However, nerf guns are not really rare.  If they were to become rare, the price of the nerf gun you bought would be incredibly high.
This is the same premise that is used when collecting baseball cards.
In other words, yes, everything can be considered a stock.

I disagree.  Mods create a subreddit.  No one is forcing you to subscribe.

You need less information to use Ameritrade and Scottrade to be honest.

Wouldn't that be the same market adjustment for if Coinbase or Bitpay got shut down?
The original argument for me was that bitcoin is not really decentralized and therefore won't be harmed permanently if either of those two places get shut down. It's still my belief that there will be a ton of these services popping up well before either of those two places have a chance to be shut down via regulators.
@_date: 2014-02-10 08:07:36
Very cool.
Yeah it is extremely cost prohibitive on a broad scale like coinbase is doing.  I think that it would be neat to see local places as small start ups.
I would LOVE if I could go someplace downtown in my little area and have a one on one interaction with a person and buy some bitcoins (or other altcoins).
@_date: 2014-04-01 17:46:36
I'm not on there either and have received no spam mails.
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:19:14
I'm just saying that what you are spouting about altcoins is the same thing that investors spout about bitcoin and for the same reasons too.
The tech for bitcoin was open source for a reason, altcoins exist because of bitcoin and competition/innovation is not a problem.
There are TONS of altcoins that are money grabs, I get that, but if you can't see some value in coins that are NOT bitcoin then you aren't any better than the investor that sees no value in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:04:59
What point am I missing?  You seem to be claiming that it was decentralized before this...it wasn't.
There are tons of altcoins that are more decentralized than bitcoin if decentralization is your goal.
@_date: 2014-02-10 06:32:15
In my experience on exchanges I've had coins disappear for hours at a time or sometimes not make their destination for days and then suddenly appear.
I've seen people complain about losing their coins much in the way I've seen people complain about losing coins on Coinbase.
I don't differentiate between Coinbase as an exchange and other exchanges here.  The fact of the matter is that you should use caution with every single one of these places.
If you have an idea what to do and can do it better, start it up!  Competition is good.  Coinbase has little competition at the moment and the incentive to have good customer service is going to be low until they are losing money.

Do they though?  I see memes recycled all the damn time.  And, in the purest definition, Bitcoin is itself a meme.
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:20:40
You'd be silly to not at least break even.
I sold 1/3 of my coins to break even right before this latest crash, which I believe to be a market adjustment.
When the price bottoms out I'll buy more and have more coins than I had before.
@_date: 2014-04-13 05:57:41
Probably more likely that this is due to the increasing number of cryptocurrencies on the market.  Especially since sidechains have really only been discussed for the last week or so.

Everything is a commodity and can be traded as a commodity.
Stocks are ownership shares in a company traded as a commodity.
The word "stock" is taken from trading commodities, I'm sure you've heard the term "livestock" to reference animals.  Well, that's animals being traded as a commodity.
Digital currency exchanges are set up almost identical to how the stock markets work. (both commodity and ownership stakes)
Therefore, digital currencies are being traded as stocks.

A "toxic waste of money and effort" is almost the identical phrase that my investment broker used when I brought up bitcoin.

If you are concerned about the quality of content, make your own subreddit.
Stop pretending you can't.
Also stop pretending that ALL mods are a mythical enemy.  If I created a subreddit with a purpose to discuss one particular point then you bet your last bitcoin that I'm going to moderate to keep it on topic.
Do you think that it would be fair if Bitcoin mods just let everyone post about whatever they wanted in here?
Let's start posting memes about non-related things.  That'll sure make the community fun and exciting.

@_date: 2014-04-11 00:34:01
I didn't say anything about not caring.
You can care about losing money and still afford to lose it, and you can stay calm losing it while still caring that you lost it.
Caring about losing money is not the same as panicking about losing money.

It only injects that money if there isn't a massive selloff.
Most people if given unexpected money spend that money.
While there is more merchant adoption coming up, the only way to "spend" crypto right now is to turn it into fiat.

It isn't transmuted into a stock, it already is a stock.  Rarity would simply make it worth more.
Stocks are simply commodity trading with ownership shares of a company. 
When you buy a Nerf Gun you obviously don't own a share of Nerf company, but you do own a share of the supply of Nerf guns, even if that share is incredibly small.

For smart people, investments are also diversified.  If you are putting money that you can't afford into highly volatile and risky speculative investments like bitcoin then your investment strategy needs some fine tuning.
The Op's post is "I don't understand why you are freaking out" which, when you object to, implies that you think people should be freaking out.
@_date: 2014-01-16 06:57:43
Sure they can. They give you a choice, lots of jail time and heavy fines or turn over your bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:54:37
If following the path of least resistance is what you believe consumers will do, we are still quite a few years away from bitcoin being widely adopted.

First, we aren't talking about taxes, we are talking about giving people paid vacation.
Second, giving someone a vacation is not even close to analogous to giving money to a homeless person.
It's kind of ironic that you can't see how giving zero vacation time IS being taken advantage of.

@_date: 2014-03-17 05:06:31
It's actually a salient point.  Op is trying to say that Bitcoin is NOT a stock and is a technology.
Technology, especially on that graph, has a huge correlation between affordability and widespread use.
If anything this graph is showing us why we shouldn't treat bitcoin JUST as a technology.  It's more than a technology.

I'm not the one downvoting you, for the record.
However, you are missing my point.  Your original argument was that bitcoin is not a stock and is a technology, then you posted a graph that shows a bunch of technologies whereby higher adoption rate is directly correlated with affordability.
If anything that says that we should treat Bitcoin as MORE than a technology because it is following an inverse path, higher price=higher adoption.

I'm pretty sure the point for many of the alt coins is that they don't care about bitcoin dev approval.
There are plenty of them that will fail, bitcoin has issues itself that might make it fail.  Having alternative cryptos that are up and running and able to be traded for goods is not a bad thing in the event that bitcoin has an issue.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:50:48
It's still an inverse relationship.  The higher the price the more viable and higher adoption rate.
The graph and analysis you've posted is the opposite.  Lower price=higher adoption rate.

Don't let these people fool you, it's far more likely that a crypto that is out right now will overtake bitcoin in the future.

I would agree with actively moderating if mods got paid, but do you know what goes into moderation?  Do you know how many posts per day a person would have to go through to remove?
There is a dedicated subreddit for bitcoin news, can decide "hey, we are getting too many of these bitcoin crossposts and they are bumping off other tech news" and filter it out.  I don't see a problem with that at all.  I don't go to for bitcoin news, I come here.
