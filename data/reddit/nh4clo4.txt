I love the scathing irony in this video, it's brilliant

How so? He may have recieved units, he may simply still believe that his units are going to arrive. Getting one is a **major** investment. Wouldn't you get really sick to your stomach, if not defensive, if you found out that new dishwasher you got for $1000 or something has really bad reviews online? What about a new car, but then you find out the transmission likes to blow out after a year or two?

Not saying I agree with this guy- BFL's fucked more than a few people over and it's time they owned up to it- but other people have other opinions. That's how the internet works. If he makes a pro-BFL comment here, isn't it to be expected his other comments are the same way? Could we at least consider the possibility that maybe he *isn't* paid by BFL? If he was then we'd see *plenty* more here on this subreddit, all the way from voting bots to spammed submissions. BFL is an evil company and if they wanted to change Reddit they'd do so via far more devious means than paying off one guy.

Yeah, I don't dispute they are pro-BFL for the reasons stated above.

I stopped mining with my personal computer a few weeks ago, emptied my bitcoin wallet (bought a Humble Bundle and donated the rest), and stopped running the BTC wallet. It used to be a pretty steady stream of pool payouts, but then this. It takes a whole month to get .01 BTC now. *sniff*

Can we stop with using "unreported by mainstream media" as a hype generator? Really? I can write all I want about how many layers of shitstained phallus-coverings I *hypothetically* throw out of windows onto unsuspecting pedestrians below, and it will be unreported by "MSM."
