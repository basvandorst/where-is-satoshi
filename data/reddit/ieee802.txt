That’s what I did at first.  Then you doubled down.


Collections of a smaller unit that isn’t scarce can be scarce.  Just because pennies are 100x less scarce than the dollar does not mean that the dollar should also be considered 100x less scarce than it actually is (the dollar isn’t scarce but you can see what I’m saying). Using smaller denominations does not make the larger denominations any less scarce.  Another example is you have 10 pizzas to feed 100 people, making the pizzas relatively scarce as not all 100 people can have a pizza all to themselves.  Just because there are 10 slices per pizza and those slices can be evenly distributed to everyone making them not scarce does not mean the pizzas themselves are not scarce.  I don’t know how else you need to have this explained because this is honestly pretty simple.


Calling you a dumbass is not the same as calling myself smart.  I’m very average in intelligence IMO, which is how I know someone who can’t grasp something like this which is simple enough for me to easily understand must be an idiot.

These ups and downs are a good thing.  It’s increasing bitcoin’s market dominance as the alts keep going down with us but aren’t able to follow us back up fully.  Every time we dip and rise the dominance increases a few percent.

...are you seriously asking why a Stablecoin is stable?  You realize tether is stable because it’s backed by USD right?  That’s the whole point.  Bitcoin isn’t backed by a stable asset, so it will be volatile until it sees a more widespread adoption and higher market cap.  This is actually how literally every speculative asset works, the lower the market cap the higher the volatility.  It’s not rocket science.

A network of payment channels for sending bitcoins to someone without interacting with the blockchain.  It’s basically a multisig address you create with the other party of the channel and then you each keep track of the sending of payments back and forth, and once you will no longer do business with each other you add it all up to a final tally of who gets what and send it to the blockchain as a single transaction.  This can be networked so if you have a payment channel with person 1 who has a payment channel with person 2, you can send bitcoins to person 2 without opening up another channel.  This spreads out infinitely creating a mesh of payment channels allowing you to securely and with microscopic fees send micropayments to any LN participant.  These channels can also be left open for years at a time or indefinitely.

I never said that as that’s moronic.  If it’s had for less it’s not a $100k degree.  I know logic is hard, though.


You can’t bring up $100k degrees and then say that public schools provide $10k tuition and then say you meant public schools the whole time you absolute dense moron.  If someone’s paying $10k a year for tuition they’re not paying $100k for a degree.
Also why are you talking about masters and doctorate degrees now?  Literally no one brought that up and no one pays $100k for a masters degree at a public university.  Most MS programs are two years so that would be $50k a year.  Weren’t you the one saying public schools are significantly cheaper.

No lol the reasons for my comments are basic math.  If the customers of these companies make profit then it means the companies are losing money by not using the hardware to just mine themselves.  Cloud mining is a business model where one side is necessarily losing money by the very nature of the business model itself.
Edit: Here’s my response to this guy’s reply as the mods locked the post but felt it should be said in case anyone else doesn’t see why cloud mining is a scam.
Cloud mining is a shitty business model as someone is losing money on one side of the deal.  If you make $10/day mining with the hardware you lease, then the cloud mining company would have to charge you less than $10/day for you to not just be wasting money.  But if they charge you less than $10/day, they’re losing money because they could be making more by just using the hardware to mine by themselves.

Some will as long as the mempool is &lt;1MB.  You don't have a guarantee even then as you would with a 1sat/byte transaction but they do get mined so you have a decent chance.  The more full nodes relay these transactions the higher this chance will be.

It will definitely be bitcoin.  Dominance is only increasing now and alts continue to simply follow bitcoin’s price movements.

No it went to 0.86 dollar once because there was speculation that tether didn’t have a 1:1 backing against the dollar.  Tether is created when dollars are given to tether the company, who then sets it aside and mints an equivalent amount of USDT.   What gives tether it’s stability is the guarantee that tether will allow anyone at any time to cash out their tether tokens for an equivalent amount of USD.  You don’t seem to understand economics at all but this honestly isn’t that complicated.

I mean I have a degree in computer science but not sure if that makes me a computer scientist.  You can keep talking about “what if’s” but they’re pretty pointless because if we define the goal as keeping transaction fees low and expanding transaction capacity eventually we will reach a point where increasing blocksize is necessary.  This has already happened as segwit was essentially just a way of increasing blocksize without actually increasing blocksize to avoid the hard fork so unless we come up with a similar trick like that it will happen.

I’m not sure why this is so hard for you to understand.  The difference I’m referring to is not in the degree subject, it’s in the school.  A $100k degree in Electrical Engineering is probably too expensive as there are schools that will provide a degree in Electrical Engineering for $50k.  That’s nice that you bring up theater degrees but I’m not sure why you thought that was relevant at all to what I’m saying.


So I don’t know if you already know this and just don’t realize what you’re saying but tuition is set for a while school regardless of degree, so it doesn’t really matter what the BS is in as any school that charges $100k+ will offer virtually any degree program you might want.  So the issue at hand is the school you attend.  My degree is in cybersecurity.  A BS in that at NYU would cost you over $50k/yr.  The same BS at a school like WGU would cost you $3k/yr.  That’s just one example, you can find something similar for almost any degree as again, that’s the tuition for all of NYU so as long as there’s a school that offers cheaper tuition and the same degree program you are essentially wasting your money at NYU.  And notice I used a school like NYU as it is different entirely if you go somewhere obscenely expensive like Yale as there you’re not paying for the degree you’re paying for the networking.  NYU on the other hand is a good school but certainly not good enough to make the more than 10x cost difference a “good investment”.

You are the idiot because you can’t seem to comprehend the difference between a hard fork and changing blockchain history.  They are two different things.  One is possible, the other is not.  One being possible would mean the blockchain is mutable, the other does not.  Understand?  It’s not that complicated.
If the blockchain were mutable bitcoin wouldn’t exist.  Bitcoin depends on the immutability of blockchain history.
And I’ve been following bitcoin since 2013 buddy don’t talk down to me like I don’t know what a hard fork is. Notice that line about how they can reverse transactions *while they were in control of the network*?  51% attacks don’t allow transactions from before the attack took place to be modified.  The 51% attack isn’t a modification of the blockchain from before the attack, a 51% attack is the act of making the future of the blockchain mutable.  A 51% attack wouldn’t be necessary if the blockchain were already mutable.

I’m not moving the goalposts you idiot that has been my definition the whole time.  I know *you’re* not talking about changing already mined blocks and that’s what makes you a moron because that is the definition of what would make the blockchain mutable.  If you’re not changing blocks that have already been mined then it has nothing to do with immutability of the blockchain.

Those rules are generated by network consensus you halfwit, not a central authority.  Network consensus is the antithesis of centralization. And no you can’t just make up whatever definitions you want.  True I could call a banana an orange if I wanted to but that wouldn’t make me any less of a moron for doing so
If there were no rules in bitcoin there’d be no bitcoin as you couldn’t verify spent funds.  That doesn’t mean it’s centralized, that just means there are rules to the decentralization.  What you’re saying is that decentralization would require me to be able to send a transaction ‘s bytes backwards and well, it’s perfectly valid!  Because there are no rules!  And of course everyone has to understand all the nonsensical packets I send to the network!  That’s actually moronic, you know.  Of course there are rules.  But they are agreed upon by a majority of nodes as a opposed to a minority of nodes.  The difference between centralization and decentralization is that decentralization allows a majority to define the rules whereas centralization has a minority defining the rules.
Believe it or not these are actual defined terms within computer networking and you look like an idiot when you use them the way you do.

It doesn’t really matter though because the best solution is a second layer anyway.

I know you have nothing to do with developing internet protocols because you think that TCP and UDP are competing.  No, they’re a package that go together with entirely different purposes.  The internet protocol suite competed with IPX, AppleTalk, Decnet, the OSI suite.  *Those* were the competition, TCP and UDP have always been complementary.  They serve entirely different purposes.  The fact that you don’t understand this shows that you have no idea what you’re talking about.  Anyone who has anything to do with networking knows this.


That doesn’t mean they were ever intended to *compete*, you dense wannabe.
And yes bitcoin will always have competing technologies within bitcoin but the point is the core technology will dominate its competitors.  TCP/IP beat out IPX and the others to form a global internetwork.  The comparison is here, and within this analogy the current “competition” between higher level protocols would be like “competition” between say Lightning Network and an alternative, or CoinJoin vs some other fungibility mechanism.  You’re really just misunderstanding everything being discussed here, to be quite honest.

TCP/IP within networking has a specific meaning and refers to the internet protocol suite.  It is so named because of the two major protocols behind it, but also includes ICMP, UDP, etc.  No one in networking uses the term UDP/IP as there is no situation that would be a useful term because 99% of the time UDP will be over IP anyway (I’m actually not even aware of UDP being used over non-IP networks but I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s been done). When someone says TCP/IP they mean the internet protocol suite, basically.  There’s a reason if you look on Wikipedia for TCP/IP it redirects you to “Internet Protocol Suite” and even says the internet protocol suite is sometimes referred to as TCP/IP

Nobody you know “develops internet protocols”.  And either way, companies like Cisco, Juniper, etc  who actually do develop these things all refer to the term correctly as TCP/IP has always referred to the internet protocol suite.  I don’t know where you work either but if people in your circles think that TCP/IP *doesn’t* include UDP then those people are simply wrong.
Not saying this is true but to be honest you sound like someone who wrote an echo server in Python once and thinks he understands networking.
Not that your weird flex of “no one I know who develops internet protocols actually uses it that way” actually means anything anyway because you just misunderstood what the original guy was saying.  Just own up to the fact that you heard “TCP/IP”, assumed he meant only the two protocols, but really he meant there’s only one internet protocol suite today.

Kind of, but eventually if everyone used LN you wouldn’t really have to worry about this as you would likely never need to send a transaction on the blockchain directly.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:42:28
The blockchain is a ledger of all public transactions where fees must be paid for a transaction to be included.  The lightning network allows funds to be exchanged without putting a transaction on the blockchain every time money changes hands.  There are only two times with the lightning network when the blockchain is used: when you mark funds for use on the lightning network, and when you release funds from use on the lightning network.  These are basically normal transactions to the blockchain so you pay just normal fees and in theory once lightning network becomes widely adopted this will happen only very rarely as you will likely only ever receive funds through the lightning network and use them within it in the first place.  The blockchain will become just a lower layer of verification of large scale shifts of funds over time while the lightning network will be used for everyday transactions. 
To get more in depth, the blockchain is involved in the creation and closing of a lightning network *channel* which as it sounds is a path funds can take for transfers.  Opening a channel between two parties allows funds to be transferred between them. A good example would be your paycheck.  When you’re hired, your employer opens a payment channel to you and pays the blockchain fee just this once.  Then your paycheck is sent to you every week over the channel without involving the blockchain.  Then, let’s say you want to give your coworker some money.  Because you both presumably have channels open with your employer for the paycheck, you don’t need to open a channel to your coworker for them to be paid.  The payment is just routed through the channel you have with your employer.  This branches out even further from there.  Then, when you quit your job, the payment channel will be closed.  Another blockchain fee is paid now and all the transactions are settled and the end result is committed to the blockchain as a single transfer of the funds locked for use in the channel.

If you’re going to say a CD is not equivalent to currency, which it is as your money doesn’t disappear when you put it into a CD just because it goes to investments, then you might as well say nothing is currency because all forms of fiat are backed by loans, which means bitcoin is worthless as unfortunately right now it’s value is measured against the US dollar.  
I’m not saying this is reasonable, on the contrary I’m using this to show how unreasonable your argument is that CDs aren’t currency is.  I don’t care that the government classified them as securities for tax and regulation purposes, there is fiat currency in use in them which if bitcoin replaced fiat would be replaced by bitcoin, so you have to include that in your estimates of the total money supply that bitcoin is up against.
And honestly that doesn’t even matter because again, you don’t need it.  2/3s of the money supply is not likely or easy to accomplish, but it is more possible than you make it seem especially if bitcoin became ubiquitous as many think it will be in the future.  I’m not making a prediction that this will be true, I’m just saying you can’t immediately dismiss it as the math allows for it.

I downvoted your post because it’s wrong but you present it as fact.  What’s more, this idea that bitcoin doesn’t need to be a medium of exchange is dangerous to bitcoin.  I’d type out a wall of text in response to yours but I don’t feel I need to as there’s not much more to say than you’re wrong.  If people don’t see bitcoin as a medium of exchange they don’t see value in bitcoin.

If you’re going to argue a CD is a security because they loan out the money than no fiat actually exists and bitcoin is worthless because we describe its price in dollars which don’t actually exist as they’re a security not a currency.
That’s the argument you’re making.
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:24:31

Bitcoin is a fantastic store of value but only so long as it also serves as a medium of exchange.  Bitcoin’s value derives from its potential as a medium of exchange.  Without that value, it simply has no value.
I don’t understand why people think there’s a dichotomy where bitcoin can only ever be a store of value or a medium of exchange.  In fact, the two are mutually inclusive.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:16:59
Yes that’s what I’m saying.  Bitcoin isn’t just a store of value because if it were it’d be worthless.  If you can’t use bitcoin for anything it has no value.

Because you made it sound like bitcoin would have to replace all monetary value to hit those prices when that’s false.  It would only have to replace 2/3s of liquid currency, which let’s be honest, is not *that* unattainable.  
Also I didn’t mean gold and derivatives made up the rest, I meant things *like* gold and derivatives.  Other commodities are included there.
Also, again, not just 401ks, and the value in 401ks is certainly relevant to the value of bitcoin.  Bitcoin wouldn’t directly replace it, but it does give bitcoin more room to grow as in the future people might be able to use their 401ks to invest in bitcoin.  There are other non-liquid accounts like CDs, certain trusts, etc which do contain currency.
It’s asking a lot, but it’s not impossible for bitcoin to reach these values.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:08:29
Yes you would pay 1k on the sell because they only take profits into consideration for taxes.  If you haven’t sold the second 1k yet for tax purposes it’s like it doesn’t exist, kind of.
It is unfair but to be honest arguments about whether or not taxes should exist at all or if capital gains should be taxed aside, I can see why they do it like that as it could get pretty complicated if you took buys into account like that.

UDP is part of the TCP/IP stack.  TCP/IP doesn’t just refer to those two protocols it refers to the technology stack behind the internet, and also includes ICMP, UDP, DHCP, IPSec, BGP, etc.  It’s just named that as TCP and IP are the two main protocols for their respective layers.

I never said something must be useful as a medium of exchange to be valuable I said it must be useful, you twat.  Your examples are still all useful as something.  If bitcoin is not used as a medium of exchange it has no use as anything else thus it has no value. You will never be able to name something useless that has value because it’s impossible.

Yes and my point is that bitcoin only has inherent value as a currency, you can use gold for other things beside currency which is what gave it the value it needed in the first place to be used for exchange, and then it built from there.  Bitcoin has no inherent use aside from exchange and thus the exchange is necessary for it to store any value.
