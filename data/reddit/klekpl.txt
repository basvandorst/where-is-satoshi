I consider myself as a careful and conscious bitcoiner. Had to swallow some losses after trying to be smart and trade altcoins (ETH). I knew not to keep my coins on exchanges. On the other hand I decided to keep a percentage of my coins on bitcoinmarket and localbitcoins - just to be able to sell immediately when I need it.
I guess I had to learn the hard way this simple truth: **not your keys - not your Bitcoins**.

It cannot be done for a very simple reason: mempool is not a subject of consensus rules so it cannot be used to influence any decisions.
The main point of blockchain is to solve the problem of reaching consensus in distributed environment. Anything not included in the blockchain cannot be trusted due to various reasons - temporary network partitioning or transaction propagation latency being just two examples. As such - any information not yet in the chain cannot form a basis for decisions of chain validity.

The point is it is not obvious other cryptocurrencies do things in better ways. If you dig deeper most of them just make a different set of tradeoffs or are really just a research into the area of blockchain technology (like Ethereum which - IMHO - seems like a dead end).

There are already 77 users registered for mixing. I think it is worth supporting initiatives like this - they all contribute to success of Bitcoin.
Altcoins have their crypto dogs and cats. Bitcoin has trustless mixers.

The problem that mining (PoW) solves is double spend. Simple chaining of transactions (without mining) allows a payer to create two transactions spending the same coins (in Git terms - to create a branch).
To prevent that, transactions are chained (ordered). Order is determined by choosing one of the participants at random as an authority to force a particular order. The randomness is preserved by PoW (mining) and to optimise the process transactions are grouped into blocks which form a chain.
Mining has two fundamental functions in all this:
* making sure the participant dictating the order of transactions is chosen at random
* making sure it is expensive for any participant to create forks

It would be great to port the software to DD-WRT and other Linux router distros.

Be careful as this is most probably a "man in the middle" scam. A scammer creates an offer to sell something and an offer to buy bitcoins. A victim pays you  and you give the scammer your coins. After some time you will be accused of fraud and might face severe consequences.
The only way to mitigate this risk is to **require** the buyer to write proper message in the payment reference (sort of end-to-end authentication). That way:
* the buyer is aware what the payment is for
* you have a proof of the payment intent
Unfortunately, the banks do not like Bitcoin related transactions. So they buyer concerns might sound legit. My advice is: do not trust the buyer.

Could you point me to some of these discussions?
I imagine it might have been difficult to come up with the solution when no cheap instant micropayments were possible. With LN it would be possible to simply pay per block.

Bitcoin difficulty is predicted to go **down** so it is going to be even more profitable mining it. It would be easier for them to switch to BCH  now - yet they do not do it.

A virus could display a different address than the one generated by your secure hardware.
If your Ledger Nano S hardware showed the address on its display - you would have a way to verify if it is the same as the one you see on the computer screen.

There are some indirect incentives but the costs are direct. This in turn causes the free rider problem - it is cheaper not to run a full node. It is even more so because popular wallets (ie. Electrum or Ledger Nano S) cannot be integrated with a private full node instance.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:15:21
You are talking about running a LN hub for profit.
I am talking about financial incentives to run full nodes so that the network is more secure.
Light wallets might need to pay for using SPV nodes. Non propagating (listening only) nodes would need to pay for blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:11:38


This is exactly why I think coming up with some financial incentive is necessary - I do not think the reasons you provide are enough to attract people.
I run a full node but it is of no use to me personally because I cannot use it with my Ledger Nano S (well - it might be possible to do it but would require running my own Electrum server - which is both expensive and not easy).
I also do not think understanding how Bitcoin works is really important to many people.

Appeals to run a full core node before the planned 2x fork and the fears of a sybill attack with artificially inflated number of 2x nodes running on AWS suggest it might be a good idea to increase the number of full nodes to increase resilience of the network to this type of attacks.

Or this really innovative bank does not let you make a totally legitimate payment and requires you to answer a shitload of personal questions and practically ask them to allow you use your own money. due to "the fraud detection system" reporting it as fraudulent.
That happened to me several times.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:28:12


This is why I chose Bitcoin.

Is your bank available in my country? I am not aware of any bank in EU that makes it possible to transfer money between accounts in two different EU member states for free.

How high are the fees in case of accounts in two different countries?
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:06:35
Sorry - this is a kind of personal question I am talking about.
Confirming identity and will of an account holder should be enough - shouldn't it?
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:38:17


Good luck!
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:12:49
I think confirming my identity and my will to do a particular payment should be enough to decide if it is a fraud or not.
This is probably why we differ in what we consider as innovative. Let me stay with my opinion of LN being innovative.

Was it between banks in two different countries?
