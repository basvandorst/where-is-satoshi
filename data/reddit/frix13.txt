what is up with the spike un BTCUSD shorts, price has been climbing so it would be expected for people to close their short positions not open 30% more of them
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:10:52
When exactly will we know if the CME whales decided to short or long?

Thank you!

soon your friends won't be able to afford 0.1 BTC anymore :)
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:44:55
the fact that you think this way only shows us that the bottom is close, when everyone is as depressed as you are, it is the best time to buy =)

one day BTC prices will follow with a chart like this, patience will be rewarded

@_date: 2019-06-06 00:51:19
well, go vote if you haven't! :)
@_date: 2019-06-06 00:49:00
what do you think :D
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:23:39
uff the fee would probably be more than that hahah :D

It will probably not stop before the fork (Nov 16th). After that, expect a big fall (that is where you buy more) but when it recovers it will go to reach new ATHs.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:49:41


you mean after the fork right...
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:21:16
Within the next two years? Pf. Make that by January :D
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:12:40
At some point you will have to convert it to fiat, might as well do it now and collect some profit then buy back after the fork, if not you can just suffer through it, it will probably go up again soon
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:50:05
ye ik, I was just exaggerating a bit for a joke =)
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:05:16
If you are looking short term then yes, if not then wait for the prices to drop after fork. However, this is a great chance for you to buy, wait a week and get a nice profit out of it by selling before fork before buying again when the price drops.
@_date: 2019-06-06 02:07:20
ah, I still think it is pretty clear what is ment :) And obviously BTC cant reach 10$ before 6k :D
@_date: 2019-06-06 01:32:21
haha true, true
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:31:15
Buy BTC before fork while there is still time, sell for alts 1-2 days before fork then wait a week or 2 and buy BTC again :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:26:54
I will always keep buying on dips and try selling on pumps while holding some
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:02:54
Sell the BTC a few days before 2x and buy it again after it drops to minimalize risk, also dont risk money you can't afford to lose.

There are more than 350 Crypto Designs, which means there are about 10-15 different Crypto coins which have their designs. Next time i suggest:  
\- you actually check what was posted instead of being smart about it  
To conclude, I am not shilling sh1tcoins, I am offering Merch more or less for top 10 coins.

Probably the easiest way is to go to  and purchase it directly with your credit card (it is instant but the fee is a bit bigger). You may also purchase it on exchanges (you will need to verify your account) like Kraken or Bitfinex. The fees of depositing are lower but it can take some time to set up the account and send the money.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:18:30
This is a good thing. Once everyone is talking about it you start getting a lot of new people into crypto who have no idea what they are doing and just want to make quick money. Now that we got rid of those people it is time to make the recovery, hopefully soon (this bear market is quite annoying)
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:24:13
The price already dropped. Some of those people stayed. And a lot of big investors are probably just waiting for the FUD to end, it doesnt have to mean they exited the market, they are just waiting to jump back into it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:25:26
When everyone is talking about crypto, it is time to sell. When noone is talking about it, it is time to buy
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:25:21
Cant wait for that feeling to come back, you can not check bitcoin price for 2 days now and it doesnt change

I have a dream where 1 satoshi is 1 satoshi because there is no fiat currency to compare it with
