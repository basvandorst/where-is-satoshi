I briefly discussed deterministic builds in the parent comment:

This guy was using a mac too. Macs are not invincible to viruses. If you download and run bad code, your bitcoins can be stolen, no matter what OS you use.

It's often a very difficult challenge to make a compiler produce identical builds. Here's some of the build reproducibility issues that the Tor developers faced:
* Reordering due to inode ordering differences (exposed via Python's os.walk())
* LC_ALL localizations alter sorting order
* Hostname and other OS info leaks in LXC mode
* Millisecond and below timestamps are not fixed by libfaketime
* FIPS-140 mode generates throwaway signing keys
* On Windows builds, something mysterious causes 3 bytes to randomly vary in the binary.
* umask leaks into LXC mode in some cases
* Zip and Tar reordering and attribute issues
* Timezone leaks
[Here's the full article on the Tor blog](
TL;DR Deterministic builds are hard.

No, it's definitely possible, but it's difficult. The Tor project does now have deterministic builds, so you can make sure that the compiled source matches the hash on the Tor website. I think Electrum also has deterministic builds now.
It all boils down to: If you trust the developers, you can trust the software. If not, your bitcoins will be stolen.

Well, sure, compiling is better than downloading a binary from an unknown developer. But it only takes one obfuscated line of code to steal your bitcoins, and by the time someone finds it in the source code, it's probably too late.

Damn, that's embarrassing! Fixed now. Thanks for letting me know!

Are you planning to buy more? How much will you be paying for electricity?
And let me get this straight... You only need to run these for 5 days before they've paid for themselves? If that's true, then why would the manufacturer sell them instead of abusing their **massive** edge?
I just don't understand how it works. I understand that profits won't last forever, but I'm sure they could make a lot more money if they pumped out bitcoins while it was worth it, and then just sold the boxes for scrap metal.
Maybe it's because ASIC development costs a ton of money, and they need a guaranteed way to recover those costs?

I'd be really interested to hear more, if you have the time. I think some us here don't have much knowledge of the stock market, so it would be very healthy to get some informed opinions.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:22:16
Holy crap. Well done.

Good on you man, that's awesome!
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:41:32
I predict that it will crash below $100 again. I've seen it crash twice, and this feels very familiar on a much bigger scale.
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:08:41
Ahh, that's great news. Would that be through a third-party service?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:58:58
That's an interesting point, I didn't expect this to become political. I think communism is excellent in principle, but it is corrupted easily into totalitarianism and autocracy. I don't see many parallels between my idea and communism, but what I love about Bitcoin is that it's algorithms are completely free from politics or any outside force that seeks to corrupt it. It's already got a lot of built-in regulations, so I'm just wondering if we should extend that pure logic all the way to the exchange with fiat currency. Anyway, thanks for your replies!

P.S. What are your thoughts on this article: 
Seems like I'm not alone in this.
@_date: 2013-03-02 09:20:18
Would it be possible to track that many bitcoins, though? Would it still be possible to make this an anonymous transaction? (Apart from having your name on the title, of course.)
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:23:47
Are there any other ideas that could help prevent future bubbles and crashes, or is this something we'll just have to live with?
@_date: 2013-03-02 09:29:37
Can I ask, why would people be tempted to sell during or after a crash? Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that the value will rebound, like it did last time?
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:20:32
Isn't your comment a text-book example of what someone would write during a '[pump and dump]( scheme? You're predicting huge growth in a public forum, you have "insider knowledge" from your experience...
While I wish I bought Bitcoins a long time ago, I feel like the crash is very close.

I would like to please second the PIN code feature. I love being able to use a PIN code to secure my bank's iPhone app.
@_date: 2013-04-03 04:07:14
Was wondering if you could please explain how this article is misinformed?
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:06:10
Ahh, I get it. Sorry, I'm still pretty new. It was from a wallet on my computer to an address on localbitcoins, and it took about 30 minutes for it to be verified. I had to keep refreshing until I was able to transfer it to the escrow address.
So you're saying that if I accepting bitcoins from someone else, I can choose to trust the sender and not bother with verification? I understand the principles behind verification, but isn't that only an issue if you think you might be receiving bitcoins from a large and dishonest organization? I was under the impression that very few people would have the ability to reverse a transaction.

Reddit's april fools thing is doing this randomly.
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:09:46
Don't worry, none of us could have predicted this with certainty.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:09:29
I understand that this is a dumb idea, but I'm not sure why... What would be the negative consequences?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:36:18
Ahh, I think I get it. The other exchanges could run out of bitcoins because of demand, and people who really wanted bitcoins could buy them from you at a much higher price. I don't see any problem with that. Most merchants would also be following the rules, so your $80 bitcoin is only going to buy you $30 worth of goods. If a majority of exchanges and merchants are following the rules, you'd be stupid to buy at a higher price. That's like me selling you a dollar bill for $2. You'd also be stupid to sell bitcoins at a lower price.
And what about the merchants that don't follow the rules? I don't think it matters at all. They're just effectively raising or lowering their own prices if they subscribe to a different exchange rate.
Am I missing something? How would you exploit this?

Who decides the gender for new words? Is it the person who introduced the word? Or, in this case, does it borrow the gender from 'coin'?
EDIT: Never mind, found the answer: 
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:10:31
Thanks for your reply, would be interested to hear about why this is a shit idea. It still seems to make sense to me...
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:11:09
Which transfer methods are those, and how can they be reversed later on? 
The annoying part for me was that I was transferring bitcoins to a localbitcoins address, and I had to wait for all 6 verifications. I probably wouldn't worry about waiting for verifications if I was receiving bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:44:22
I believe in Bitcoin's long-term future, but of course it's going to crash again. Probably below $100.
@_date: 2013-03-29 07:32:16
The only problem I have with bitcoins is that it took me 30 minutes to make a transfer. It doesn't strike me as modern or convenient.
