How does third party P2P node work?  It wounds like someone is doing the P2P mining for you similar to a CloudHashing contract.

So if i'm running a full node for mining and I a allow others to use my node, won't I have centralized control?

Take your pick.

But if my P2P node is like my own mining pool, won't it have the capability of double spending if it reaches over 50% of the hashrate?


Unless I think like GHash.io and charge 0 fees which incentivises more people to mine on my node.

You're strictly talking about Libre, right?  I'm not too familiar with Libre other than using the sum function.  As far as BitcoinTaxes calculator goes, it seems to be giving values in the closing position report which are always a few percentage points away from matching my current wallet balances.
