Cool, let me know your thoughts :) You can get really good interest on coins that are increasing in value. Check for instance 0x right now. Yesterday it was  0.16 % per day :)

Yes, true that its not available in US. Also, true that they were hacked. I was in the hack and they handled it pretty go under the circumstances. That was why I said be aware of the risks.

If you are serious and want to trade large amounts I would go for BitMEX. However, if you beleive you can make 1 trade to become rich I would recommend you to rethink instead. Trading is a living or a hobby and nothing for those who are looking for a one time lottery ticket (Even though the odds are probably better than lottery).

You can get pretty good interest at Bitfinex margin lending. You lend your holdings to other traders which use them for leverage trading. They pay interest on daily basis. It differs from day to day but it is usually 5-20% per year. I have tested it and it works fine for me. Be aware of the risks before you make any investments.

Read this article: 
Be aware it is written of BitMEX itself but it is very transparent and clear.

I just double checked and 4-8% is more correct for BTC lending. 5-20% are old numbers. Thanks for the comment :)

The information is sill not disclosed, just that "six large exchanges" will list it.
@_date: 2018-10-19 04:41:44
With 4-8%, do you take into account interest-on-interest since the payout is on daily basis?

I have tested almost all different cloud mining companies :) There are many scams so I wouldnt go for any small unknown company. If you are about to buy I would go for Genesis Mining. Historically, you would have made more profit if you bought the cryptocurrency itself rather than the cloud mining contracts. I did created [ to seperate scams from legit cloud mining companies. However, it is not updated but there is still a promo code for Genesis Mining if you are interested to try :) promo code "allcloud"

There are actually some more. I Think Bitfinex describe it best themselves here:
I have been doing margin funding for 1.5 with Bitfinex and didnt experience any problems or losses. Also, remember that Bitfinex take 15% of your lending income in commission.

The exact predictions might not be very interesting. However, the arguments behind the predictions are very interesting and by putting numbers on the arguments its sometimes easier to understand them
