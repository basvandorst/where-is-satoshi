Telling people you ate a hamburger and then vomited doesn't make you sound cool or sophisticated, it makes it sound like you have a weak digestive system. If you honestly can't eat McDonalds without vomiting, you should probably see a doctor.

Yes it is, and treating it as just simple supply-demand law doesn't make it a brilliant point, it makes it a simple point. 


Yes, future speculation in part on the utility of the technology, not just some perception of scarcity. 


Yes it is, it's worth what people will pay for it. 


The current price has been declining substantially. The price is strongly correlated with public interest:  If everyone holds, and no one uses it as a currency, and businesses lose any incentive to accept it, do you really believe that the price will go up? 


Very few, which is why the price keeps dropping. The flurry of press of all the big retailers that were going to accept it, physical ATMs, etc. drove the price up. Now that it's only people trying to hold to get rich quick, the price is crashing. Because it becomes a useless technology.

That's the problem, you think basic economics is enough to explain something as complicated as the value of bitcoin. It's not, and rarely do basic explanations explain anything. 
You're assuming that just by holding something that the demand is going to drive up and supply will drop. But the demand is inextricably linked to it's utility, and if everyone simply holds, and businesses are forced to stop accepting Bitcoin (what's the value? no one spends any), then my demand for them certainly isn't going to go up just because you're trying to make them scarce.
