@_date: 2019-07-31 11:21:37

@_date: 2019-07-31 11:19:37

How long have you used this DCA Strategy?
@_date: 2019-07-25 09:37:05

But still can access binance with a VPN. But the withdrawal limit will be 2 btc every 24 hours

A block halving is a process of reducing the rate at which new cryptocurrency units are generated. Specifically, it refers to the periodical halving events that decrease the block rewards provided to miners.

I meant the countdown to zero �� Bitcoin is my love man
@_date: 2019-07-31 13:21:11

@_date: 2019-07-31 14:07:49
I'm 50% with Bitcoin, 30% with Ethereum, 20% shit alts hehe
@_date: 2019-07-31 17:32:40
Won’t affect your bitcoin. But normally the price might keep rising before the halving
@_date: 2019-08-01 01:52:19
Seems lots of KuCoin supporters here !!
@_date: 2019-08-01 01:52:45
Would you use binance.us ?
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:16:29
Yeah, they’re the most trustworthy exchange in the market right now. The interested part of this data is that you’ll notice some exchanges are running out of money. So it’s dangerous to put your money in those exchanges
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:00:14
Gemini has 873.6k ETH, we’re still tracking their bitcoin data. Full list will be disclosed on December 12!
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:10:26
Huobi have more bitcoin than Binance?! Holy...
@_date: 2019-12-08 05:17:20
Check out their website. It’s a special event on Jan 3
@_date: 2019-12-01 17:35:03
It’s all on-chain. The hard part is to match the addresses to exchanges. BitUniverse and PeckShield blockchain security company work together to get this data.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:40:33
Bitcoin never dies. But the price will dump real hard if that happen, but that’s the time to accumulate more cheap bitcoin hehe
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:41:13
Where did you see that data a year ago? From some news?
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:21:46
Here’s their USDT address 
It’s all on chain and we’ll release all the address shortly. Thank you for your work to checking on it! Are you also working in a blockchain related company?
@_date: 2019-12-02 11:29:41
Try APK on the website? Or if you’re using iOS, use the TestFlight version.
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:53:38
Chinese exchanges will be released on December 12. Same as Huobi and OKEx.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:38:20
No, it’s the balance in their wallets
@_date: 2019-12-08 10:49:44
Another legit bitcoin funds which provides a better rate compared to BlockFi. Check it out here:
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:58:17
Full list will be released on December 12 ;)
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:02:00
Provided by PeckShield and BitUniverse team. They’ll provide how they calculate this. And exchanges will provide their cold wallet address if they don’t agree with the data.
@_date: 2019-12-02 12:21:04
Full list will be released on December 12
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:08:12
IMO, most of the users still preferred centralized exchanges for custody. Maybe we can compare this data with who really use their own wallet. Then it’d be more clear :)
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:26:41
Here’s their USDT address 
It’s all on chain and we’ll release all the address shortly. Thank you for your work to checking on it! Are you also working in a blockchain related company?
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:53:06
The bitcoin amount in their cold wallets
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:54:22
All data can be analyzed from the on chain data. We’ll release how we calculate this shortly. And you’ll be surprised that how many decent exchanges have already involve in this transparent balance rank
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:03:41
Full list will be released on December 12
@_date: 2019-12-01 15:15:25
Rank 10-50 will be released on DEC 12. That’d be lot more scary.
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:25:44
The site you’re looking is not the most accurate data.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:02:15
������ true
@_date: 2019-12-02 09:13:36
This is by on chain data. Their cold wallets.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:06:59
Upgrade your app to the latest one. If you can’t upgrade it on the google play store, then wait some time because google might still reviewing this upgrade.  Or you can download the latest upgrade through their website
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:56:08
When you found one of the exchange you’re using only have 50 BTC left, then you’ll know the power of these data.
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:41:11
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:41:32
Charging ��
@_date: 2019-09-05 02:39:25
 Yeah, not your keys, not your coins. Just don't put all your eggs into on basket and I think that'd be fine.
Maybe in the future we could get some interest and don't need to transfer our funds to other wallets! Looking forward to it!
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:50:56
What’s the fundamental after that? Lending?
@_date: 2018-12-26 13:00:23
