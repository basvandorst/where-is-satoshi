I'm so glad I replied here today. This is the most hilarious thing I could have possibly hoped for. I thought you'd just be some defensive dude really into his bad investment but you're a full blown nut.

It's funny how much conspiracy theorists stay the same. I swear I had this same conversation with a colleague in 2011 who believed Obama was going to destroy NATO and China and Russia would take over the world stage. That was his excuse for buying gold coins from Rush Limbaugh.

Oh man, you're not trolling me right? You're really sincerely responding to me telling you that you're too ignorant to look something up with... telling me I need to look it up for you. This is serious? You're not just pretending to be like this? This is how your brain actually works?

There's no serious conversation here. I'm just mocking you because you can't see that your jumps in logic are olympic leaps, all to reach the conclusion that an algorithmic internet currency mainly used to trade heroin is definitely more stable than the world's reserve currency belonging to the sole economic hyperpower.

The fact that you think the world's largest reserve currency of over 60% of international holdings is going to shift any time in your lifetime without a major world war is quite literally insane. In order to shift that much without a major global destabilization event that destroys the world economy to begin with, it would take a century of careful divestment.
If you're going to "keep up with geopolitics" you might want to understand world economics before you try to apply the future plans of other economies to your nutty projections.
EDIT: Holy shit you're an actual coocoo clock. Better put on that tinfoil hat before the lizard people know you're onto them.

You didn't ask me to back up anything, you asked me to validate the basis of your insane leaps of logic because you can't connect A to B without your imagination inbetween. The fact that you think anything I said "fell through" is... just hilarious.

You might have the ability to sew the tiniest inkling of doubt or concern if you didn't sound like a broken record that repeats exactly the same reasoning and ideas that every conspiracy theorist since the 1960's has.
It seems like you people that get stuck in this thought trap can formulate all these conclusions in your head but somehow can't come up with the idea to look up whether anyone else has been saying the same things as you for over half a century.

Yeah, okay. I literally opened by comparing you to a nutjob that wasted his savings on collector coins because a racist pundit told him to.
