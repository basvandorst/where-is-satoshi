"The debt is not payable," Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla told The New York Times. "There is no other option. I would love to have an easier option. This is not politics, this is math." He also said he will ask its creditors for more time to pay off what it owes.

After watching Google gradually slip into ethically questionable use of the data they collect, other companies see it as business-as-usual. Damn shame.

Yeah, I'm of the same mind. Since I got Simple Bitcoin Widget I never use the Coinbase app. As a matter of fact I think I'll uninstall the Circle and Blockchain apps also.

It's been a while sinced I first installed the Coinbase Android app. But it looks like the only permission it needed then was the camera. To scan QR codes.
Edit: Oops. Forgot the pic. 
So, WTF do they need these additional permissions for now? SMS? Contacts? etc?
Any app devs in here who can expand on the whys and wherefores?
BYW - I didn't do the upgrade yet. Smells a little fishy.

You can brand it as "one-on-one career counseling". You're a good and noble man.

Veeery shrewd indeed.
1. Spread the gospel of Satoshi.
2. Meet good looking hookers.
Hmmm..., methinks I'll do the same thing in my city.

To clarify a bit...
TBLOP.com isn't a porn site per se. They don't have a revenue stream. It's "The biggest list of the best porn sites". They've been around for quite a while.
Not that I would know anything about this market sector personally. But the brother of a friend of a guy I work with was talking about it.

Chillax, dude. Where's your libertarian fervor?
Tits for bits. Loin for coin. It's called the free marketplace.

Thanks for the info.
Is there any ETA for Darkwallet? What I see on the website is, *"IMPORTANT The wallet is Not Stable or Safe, and at this point you should use it with real money only at Your Own Risk."*
I guess I'll keep plugging away at my hillbilly, shade-tree workaround until DW is ready.

When women first meet me they say I'm ugly. But then when they find out many bitcoin I have, they say I'm ugly AND poor.

Thanks. Good info.

I must insist that you immediately cease spying on me via my laptop camera, and monitoring my browsing.
And then - adding further insult to your intrusive, stealth activity - you cruelly parody my my roller-coaster emotions with a WAY too accurate cartoon.
Your cooperation in this matter is appreciated.

Assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell gave a speech in which he urged banks to “alert law enforcement authorities about the problem” so that police can “seize the funds” or at least “initiate an investigation”.
