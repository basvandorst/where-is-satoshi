He'll support bitcoin, like gold, when someone pays him to shill it.  Glenn Beck would wear an "I heart the Fed" t-shirt if there was money in it.

I think it's important to let new folks know that the value fluctuates wildly.  That $1 could tomorrow be $10 or $0.01 depending on the day's shenanigans.

I have the same issue with pay-to-pitch with my startup.  It used to be something a few groups required and the rest of us balked at.  Now it is a standard.  We're a culture of greed and entitlement.  Every industry succumbs to it, you just have to keep pushing back or you become just another case that validates their practice.

*be the change*  
If you adopt status quo tactics, don't expect anything to change.  Maybe if you didn't take that $8k they would adjust their preconceptions.

Isn't it just based on a stabilizer mount?

You'd be preaching to the choir.  Most of those kids have been lying to their friends about bitcoin mining already.  Advertise to people that don't know anything about you if you want to increase adoption.

I think the idea was to build on this existing product, not put it out there as a turn key solution.  If you can cobble something like this together in a day, then you should definitely make something for op's request.  You sound like a shoo-in!

Sounds like a problem to deal with if it comes up, not before.  Just need something to flag manipulation.

Depends on how sanctioned countries using crypto currencies plays out.

That only scratches the surface of Rand Paul...  He basically took the *aw shucks* pseudo libertarian reputation of his dad, fat stacks from corporations and the leftovers from the Lyndon larouche street urchin teams.  In reddit terms he's the conservative right's Poochy.

The incentive being some interest for the deposit?  Is anybody doing this currently? 
@_date: 2013-10-02 21:29:31
Yes, it's interesting that claiming you're trying to obfuscate is enough to damn you.  They really don't even need to go into detail regarding how effective the obfuscation was.

As I understand Bitcoin, you can't loan out what you don't have.  I can see how someone will (or already does) sell futures and promissory notes for BTC but I don't see how a bitcoin lender can loan more bitcoins than they have if there is actual code tied to the unit.  Please enlighten/depress me.

I'm new, so forgive my ignorance, but while I see the benefit of receiving bitcoin/cash over insurance disbursement, I don't see the benefit of bitcoin over cash in this example.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:15:49
I get the potential of early adoption of bitcoin in general/theory, I just didn't see the sell of bitcoin over cash for health clinics specifically.  If they had a clientele specifically interested in cash alternatives or if accepting cash payment was a current pain point for them (security possibly?) it would make more sense.  Outside of that it seems like the selling point (and drawback) is the same for any speculative currency like gold or silver.  I think the most appealing benefit at first glance from a novice point of view would be removing theft of cash-on-hand opportunity, so the onus would have to be on comparing it to a debit card transaction.  Taxi services and food delivery would probably be a potential market as they would see more cost per transaction % on credit cards and they are constant targets for theft.  Interesting experiment.  I hope it doesn't devolve into a currency speculation pyramid scheme.

More like concern over currency stability, but ok.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:57:37
Thanks.  I'll look that over.  I wasn't assuming a central pyramid, though, more peripheral opportunism, like what you see with [current alternative currencies](

It was the inevitable result of using an unsustainable *tactic* (i.e. civilization is crumbling buy gold fast) rather than a legitimate attempt to identify and correct the inefficiencies with the current model.  Lots of people flush with gold faced with the reality of how time consuming it is to use it as a direct payment.  Fabricate a time sensitive problem, provide the solution and then offer a solution to the solution collecting fees at all stages.  It's an older con than Ponzi.

The first rule of Bitcoin Club is, you do not talk about Bitcoin Club.  
Seriously, stop fucking focusing on the value. I feel like the original conversation was about transforming a broken system of exchange into something more equitable, but now it's a bunch of hand-wringing about valuation.  Even worse, I see a shitton of **OMG My Bitcoins will be worth MILLIONS!**    
tl;dr To give this experiment a chance, stop doing so much of [this](

So is bitcoin an alternative way to conduct business or a way to earn more traditional currency by speculation?

Well my wife grew up under the Argentine dictatorship and we still have friends and family there that lived through the recent default, so I have the luxury of a few fancy words I picked up from people who have actually lived through a dictatorship.  
That said, "gubmint" seems much fancier than "currency stability".

I'm guessing most people you mention bitcoin to think you're playing Super Mario Bros. and are a little disappointed when you aren't.

No facts are out.  The "hitman" and the "hit" could easily be the same individual.  It could just as easily have been an attempt to pay a lesser amount of blackmail and scare the blackmailer off thinking he was willing to plan a murder.  
Like you said, though, these kinds of things only happen when prohibition is in place.  Had it been someone blackmailing Bank of America, the feds would have been called in.
