Too many bitcoiners are starry eyed idealists.

How do micro insurers make sure they don't get ripped off? Don't big insurers have the resources to send people out and investigate fraud?

Build more power plants they're is plenty of uranium,plutonium,thorium, deuterium/tritium, solar, geothermal, coal and methane hydrates. Either that or stop driving, join an agrarian commune and start using peercoin!

The miners are capitalist,  in some cases we pay them transaction fees.

But if you had like a hundred $1 micro insurance claims wouldn't be too much trouble for the small amount of money to even check if the claim is fraudulent or not?  Would law enforcement have to check ever claim? and wouldn't that been incredibly wasteful of their time and resources? Or could the micro insurers spent some amount of they're pool on dedicated investigation firms?

It's hard to feel sorry for people who pay so much extra for such superficial crap when the shit hits the fan. They live in an endless spiral looking for happiness is the most miserable of places.
Hold yo crypto currencies and when are those colored coins coming?

It doesn't matter that you're 15, it doesn't matter you have 6 bitcoins. It's just annoying to see people who say "I want/wish/have/am/fear" etc. It feels like they're just waving they're arms yelling look at me, not producing any valuable information. We have less and less time and data caps to spend reading such information. 
And good for you. Best of luck with you're investment and hold til you can buy trips to space and a models s if you're into that sort of thing.

Well fuck me anyway.  Can't follow my own advice.

Thank you. Have to do more research, only have been following this casually.

I don't think a cold fusion blog is a very reliable source.

Electrum maxes out at 100 sats/byte which is still quite slow at two and half hours. Of course you can enable custom rates but be aware that they measure in sats/kilobyte so divide by ten. For optimal speeds pay 180 bits/byte.

Well now I wear straw fedoras for despite what we've faced I am still euphoric.

That's a funny question to ask bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2016-02-18 13:06:49
Sorry to skirt the issue. But why do you follow bitcoin?

Yay techno libertarianism
