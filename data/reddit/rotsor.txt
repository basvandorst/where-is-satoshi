The expected value will still be the same because the difficulty increase is affecting low-variability miners the same way it affects high-variability ones.

This is right of course. My point is that your e-mail address is easier to remember than even single additional english word, while adding more entropy.

In case my point didn't come through: this is not a joke. Including non-secret personal information into your passphrase greatly improves security without affecting memorability. You should always do it. Doesn't have to be an e-mail address of course.

They took down their wire transfer deposit option from the web site some time ago. However, I was able to make a deposit anyway after contacting support. They told me they are currently developing an automated wire transfer processing system to make it faster and more convenient. When they're done, the bank transfer deposit option will reappear, they say.
@_date: 2012-12-12 23:04:45
No, I mean a *public* piece of information, which is trivial to remember and personal enough to never collide "by accident". Remembering your own e-mail address or your name is surely much easier than remembering two random words while adding a similar amount of entropy. Remember, this is not to protect against attacks aimed at you personally, but rather against normal attackers, attacking everyone at the same time.
Now, the secret component of the password should be a little more complex than "password", but that's maybe too much to ask from a person described in the OP. :)

I think you may be confusing the general notion of ASIC (which means only what it stands for: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) with a specific Altera HardCopy methodology where they "print" a design intended for FPGA. In general there is no such thing as "*the* ASIC's design" and ASICs don't have to be hard-burned FPGA designs.

Section 11. Calculations of the Satoshi's paper gives the formula for the "probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind" without ever mentioning the block time, only depending on block count.

Ripple has an open distributed protocol, which as of now only happens to be fully implemented by a promised-to-be-opensourced server software. So (the equivalent of) the blockchain is currently run by the limited number of people having access to that software, meaning the actual robustness of decentralised network is not there yet.
Nonetheless, the operation is transparent and any abuse of the protocol is easily detectable by open-source clients.
Now, even if the protocol wasn't decentralized the IOUs (bitcoins and dollars in Ripple) certainly are: any user of the system can issue any amount of any currency as a debt to another user directly.
What isn't and won't be fairly distributed in Ripple is its native currency (XRP). It can't be distributed to miners because there is no mining so the developers decided to leave its whole supply to themselves. This makes XRP currency a risky investment (or a donation to developers if that's how you like to look at it).

1 GH/s is currently valued at around 3-5 BTC (the ASICMINER auction and a couple Avalon devices were sold around that price level). BFL is offering their devices at about 0.43 BTC per GH/s. This means that difficulty needs to rise about tenfold for them to become a bad purchase.
Assuming the difficulty continues its trend to slightly-more-than-double every two months, you have about 5 months for BFL to ship.

A money  making machine isn't very profitable if it can't produce its own cost over its lifetime. ASICMINER is worth about 1 million bitcoins now. Considering there are only about 10 million bitcoins to mine for *anyone ever* I'm pretty sure it can't take that much in mining *profits*.

That's true if you conjecture that average Joe necessarily executes a market order on the continuous market. That's not necessarily true.
Bitstamp's "instant" orders may be one example. They are not instant, and your money is being used for market making.
Other strategies can be used on continuous markets too. My favourite is Dutch auctions. They also lead to Joe trading directly with Jack without needing a dedicated market making service.

@_date: 2013-05-09 20:10:48


Yes, but that's an important "if". Why would someone want to buy a company? Is it to sell it higher later? No, usually it's to manage it (use the voting power I mentioned) in some way that makes it more profitable or to use its assets in some other way. If the company doesn't have any valuable assets (and I believe ASICMINER will have none once they stop being very profitable) there will not be a lot of people willing to pay much for it.


Well, there is the range of options the asset holder is entitled to. You can drive car, you can eat food, you can use stock to manage the company or to receive dividends. I'd say those determine the inherent value of the asset. Cars wouldn't be valued the same if you weren't allowed to drive them, would they?


Fine, fine. I estimate the value of ASICMINER shares to become very low (close to the cost of assets backing it) once the mining stops being very profitable (in a couple of years I guess). However, the distribution of value between dividends paid out and share value retained is decided solely by the company management and can not be predicted.

      take 20 .                     -- take the first 20 bytes, dropping the rest
      pad 20 0 .                    -- pad with zeroes on the left to 20 bytes
      reverse . drop 4 . reverse .  -- drop last 4 bytes (to be replaced with a checksum later)
      b58decode .                   -- decode base-58 to bytes
      (++ replicate 7 'W') .        -- append 7 'W' characters
      take 25                       -- take 25 characters of the original string
The original bug was "take 26" instead of "take 25". The "take 20" part was not there initially and probably does nothing now, but I've put it there just to be safe (the list somehow got larger than 20 bytes originally).

If you make profit that's good for bitcoin because you contribute to price stabilisation (you bought when it was undervalued and sold when it was overvalued).

There is a total of 400000 ASICMINER shares. That makes its market cap. about 520000 bitcoins. That is equal to 144.4 days of the global bitcoin production, almost five months of mining monopoly. To be a worthwhile investment the company needs to mine more than that to use the surplus to cover its expenses so I'd say about two years of controlling a third of the bitcoin mining will be needed. Also as the market becomes more efficient the expenses will have to increase a lot to preserve a significant market share, making mining barely profitable eventually.
So I'd say the current company valuation is optimistic as it is and there may be no ROI ever.

No, this time I'm pissed. I had high hopes with an open buy order at $101, but these suckers were barely able to bring the price down to $110.

Actually the likelihood is much higher because the first 8 characters become known to the buyer before the coins are funded.

I guess with 1-second block target the attacker can perform his attacks more often or at a cheaper cost. However, that only scales linearly while the attack success probability scales exponentially.

Yes, but the number of bitcoins created per day will be slightly larger during the growth of the hashpower because the difficulty adjustment lags a little. Indeed, the block creation rate is closer to 7 per hour lately rather than 6 per hour as it should be.
@_date: 2013-05-02 19:18:51
No, if you assume the difficulty doubling every two months and the shipment delay of more than 7 months, then there is no ROI ever, not in 2 years, not in 200. You people don't seem to understand exponentials.

Do you understand how much lower the future price of an ASICMINER share is? It must be lower exactly by the amount of dividends expected. So if one expects to return the capital via dividends it's only natural to expect the share price to drop close to zero during that time.

Yes, but there are many private keys allowing you to spend money sent to a given address.

They seem to imply that they won't exceed a certain share of total mining power though, which is important if you are concerned about the possibility of a 50% attack.
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:34:54
I agree, flat rate makes the most sense because it both helps fight off the trade spam (the problem Mt.Gox seems to be having) and improves liquidity a lot. Unfortunately most (all?) of the existing exchanges employ percentage-based trade fees.
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:03:22
Yes, I think so. By giving it to miners you make the bitcoin supply less stable and mining more wasteful. Also I am a bitcoin-holder so obviously I like it better when you give it to myself rather than to miners. :D

Holding the individual transaction output unspent should not make any difference at all. The only thing that matters is the contract.

There are two points I take away from that article:
1. VWAP is a poor metric.
2. Keeping order book (at least partially) hidden is advantageous.
However I fail to understand the benefits of making trading coarse-grained. The recent Mt.Gox fiasco is not inherent to real-time trading (as can be demonstrated by success of much larger exchanges), but rather caused by poor algorithms. An efficient order matching algorithm only needs up to O(log(N)) time per ~~trade~~ order with N being the total size of the order book.

You can send coins to any valid address you like even without knowing its private key. Address validity rules are rather simple so you can write anything you want in it if you make sure to put correct checksum in the end (4oLvT2 in this case).
The coins on such an address are unspendable because obtaining a private key for a given address is computationally infeasible.

By delayed execution I meant this from the OP: "trading is allowed to happen only once every five minutes". If I need to sell bitcoins at a given price ASAP I will rather use continuous market than a market with a five-minute delay because the uncertainty is slightly less there.

Many-leading-zeroes addresses can be generated en masse easily. For vanity addresses you'd need a little bit more code, but the general algorithm is the same: you choose any data prefix you want and make a bitcoin address with mkAddress function, which is only as slow as double SHA256.
    module Main where

    fromBase b = foldl (\a c -&gt; fromIntegral c + a * b) 0
    toBase :: Num a =&gt; Integer -&gt; Integer -&gt; [a]
    toBase b = reverse . unfoldr f where
     f 0 = Nothing
     f n = Just $ first fromInteger $ swap $ n `divMod` b
    b58chars = "123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    b58encode :: [Word8] -&gt; [Char]
    b58encode l = replicate (length $ takeWhile(==0) l) '1' ++ 
    	  (map (b58chars!!) . toBase 58 . fromBase 256) l
    sha256x2 = B.unpack . SHA256.hash . SHA256.hash . B.pack where
    checksum = take 4 . sha256x2
    mkAddress :: Word8 -&gt; [Word8] -&gt; [Char]
    mkAddress v d = b58encode $ v : d ++ checksum (v : d)
    pad n c l = replicate (n - length l) c ++ l
    main = do
      mapM_ (print . mkAddress 0 . pad 20 0 . toBase 256) [0..10]

Yes they are different in that they are enjoying a temporary exclusivity boost which be over sooner or later.


No, mining 5% is not enough. They need to get 5% of all of the remaining coins in profit rather than revenue. Sure,  they have a few month of "free" mining where their profit margin is close to 100%, but will that be enough? The profit margin will be falling very rapidly.


Hardware sales are priced according to the mining difficulty and contribute to it anyway, so they are probably not different.


No argument here, that could be a contribution. Namecoin should be able to give another few percent.

Exactly! The only product of mining is network security, which comes at a huge cost. Now, if it was possible to achieve security in a different, cheaper way, for example like Ripple claims to have done, wouldn't that be wonderful?
