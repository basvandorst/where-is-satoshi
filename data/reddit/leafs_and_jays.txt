Very slowly as Ive learned. I wanted to buy in at just below $10k but havent been able to. my verification has been pending on quadrigacx for over a week, and i can only buy $250/week from coinbase. I thought my coinbase limit would increase after spending $250 but now it tells me i have to wait 30 days for the limit to increase. i was planning on buying a full bitcoin at 10k, wasnt able to, and now its at 14k. its so frustrating. any other sites i can deposit to instantly with a relatively quick verification process??

how long do transactions usually take? i just got a nano s and tried to move some bitcoin from coinbase to the wallet. its been pending for almost 6 hours now. In comparison my ethereum transfered in less than 10 mins? im a noob so if im missing something obvious i apologize but whats going on here?

I was looking into bitcoin ATMs but it looks like the one by me charges a crazy fee of 12%. If i find a cheaper one I may use it. Am i able to send BTC directly to my nano s from the atm? Thanks for the help by the way.

it took 9 hours last night for my transfer to go through from coinbase to nano s

its up almost 10k for me now since i wanted to purchase (coinbase now showing $20500). i was trying to buy 1 bitcoin at 11k but the verification is taking so long everywhere. ive only been able to put in $250 on coinbase. its the worst feeling knowing i missed out on nearly 100% gains this last week. also i can only afford 0.5BTC now rather than the 1.0BTC i was planning to purchase.

damn thats frustrating. i know coinbase is down for me right now, maybe that could be it. hopefully it gets sorted out soon
