Not a bad reason to cash out. Being realistic, anyone who says to hodl and go into debt over it is insane. The 0.3 you cash out can pay back much more in value with the education (money earned from work, not paying off interest on loans, etc). Best of luck to you and your wife!

Bank account takes over 2-3 days. It can actually take 7-10 days. Wire transfers from your bank are much quicker (they say same day if posted before 1 PM PST but under 24 hours is more realistic), but you pay the wire transfer fee. Credit Card is instant but has the highest fees.

Yes first wire, I have a regular deposit pending as well (which I know won't clear to there for a few more days at least). Everything else was normally from coinbase itself and put over there either as usd or BTC.

I guess I will have to, hopefully it will be there by tonight. If not I'll try and contact support.

In terms of value or in terms of interest? 
In terms of value: The amount it is worth in fiat (USD/GBP/EUR etc) will rise and fall based on the market rate for 1 BTC.
In terms of interest: You will not gain any BTC either way unless you purchase more or are given some. The total you have will remain constant, but the value vs fiat currency will change as above.
You will take a minor hit in terms of BTC amount when you move to an external wallet (I personally use a Trezor), but otherwise your total BTC will ramin constant there unless you change it. And is much more secure against problems with an exchange.

They say 1 day if you submit before 1pm PST. I put in for a wire transfer early this morning (prior to 1pm PST by a good margin) and have not seen it show in my account or even show pending in my account. When I called GDax (same company) about this I was told there are several transfers and it is going slow but it should be received by end of day. We will see how that goes for now...

So withdrawl to wallet fees should be about the same either way, but for purchasing its better imo to put money in for gdax (which is owned by coinbase) or another exchange and buy that way. And use limit purchases (lots of youtube video ls on it) to save on the fee they hit you with for buying the market price

Tried to post this in a separate post but it was removed for being about price...
So I went to withdraw what bitcoin I had in my account on Gdax to hodl (I had cashed out fiat to BTC somewhere else at 10380 per right before it flash crashed, rip me). I got an email confirming that the withdraw request went through and sent it to Coinbase. I decided to send it BACK to Gdax and play with it when I saw no transaction was made to my Trezor (and still none has been for over an hour or so now). This is where I get worried about an issue:
Apparently Gdax never cleared the balance from it, so now it registers me having double what I had withdrawn/put in. While I would love to have doubled it easily like that, I don't want to be banned from the exchange for something like this. Anyone else have issues like this in the past?

UPDATE: Looks like it was a total system failure on the deposit/withdraw side of Gdax. I just attempted to withdraw the full amount (the doubled amount of my original) from Gdax to Coinbase and it worked fine, and my balance on coinbase is fixed. Withdrawing from there to my Trezor now to be safe as always.

You can sell on coinbase without a problem but you will pay a fee. Same as if you sold as a market sale on gdax. Transactions (BTC wallet to wallet, etc) will cost a small fee. Coinbase buying/selling has a higher fee than using limit sales on gdax for instance.

Would love too, but I don't want to get bounced from the exchange or in trouble for it lol.

I did my wire transfer through gdax. After going through all the verification things it needed, I choose to deposit USD via Wire Transfer. It showed all the needed info for the recipient and I submitted that info to an online wire transfer through my bank. When you do the transfer it has a spot for notes for the recipient and the code for your account they give you goes there. 
I'm not sure how it goes in person for wire transfers.
I have not had it show pending or had the money deposit yet so I don't know what is going on but it has been a bit since my bank cleared the transfer (like 10+ hours).

Luckily seems like it was a system fault on there end and I was able to get it out and into my wallet.

May not have been you. Depending on your bank if you used a credit card or debit card they may have blocked it as a fraudulent activity. I know mine will send me a message and ask me to release the card and then redo the transaction.

Ok so is it safe to assume it will send me the amount originally wanted and wipe the gdax balance to 0?

No problem and happy trails!
