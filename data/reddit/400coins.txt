My main account has been also been slightly doxed and I've had some weird shit happen to it so I'm going throwaway if I ever disclose anything sensitive.


I bought all my bitcoin at less than 20 dollars each so I dont share the same price concerns that you have. Millions of dollars of investment are being pumped into Bitcoin so it's got a lot to go but in many regards bitcoin is already a success story. It's facilitating international transactions on a daily basis.

Everyone has their price. Someone sitting on say a million dollars worth of something that they paid pennys for burns a hole in your pocket and eventually you cash out. I dont think there are many of them, remember the bearwhale from last month? The sell did very little to the market and there can only be so many of those and they are being weeded out daily.

I bought my coins the same month as you OP. I have over 400 and have no interest in selling them apart from the small purchases I occasionally make. I check the price maybe once a day. Bitcoin has a lot more to go. I wouldn't chance being out of the most exciting thing to happen to computing in decades.

I have 4 times as many coins as you. If IRL people knew how much I have invested they would plea bargain me to diversify. Im a permabull, we still have 10x to go at the very least.
