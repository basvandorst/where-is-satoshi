OP is a liar.
This can be demonstrated using simple math and uncontroversial facts:
The *earliest* point at which the price hit $1000 on Coinbase was November 28th, 2013.
The amount of fortnights between that date and now is 18.
18 x $50 = $900.
OP bought the initial 1 BTC for $1000, and says he now has 4 BTC. 
That means he must have paid on average $300/BTC for the additional 3 Bitcoins, yet the price has never been at $300/BTC on Coinbase since the price hit $1000.
You might say, 'Well perhaps OP is just rounding up the amount of Bitcoin he has', but if he paid 'just under the current price' - say $550/BTC - then that would mean he would have 2.818 BTC in total. It's certainly not a matter of slight exaggeration or rounding up.

No it doesn't, as I demonstrate in this post:

I distrust anyone who feels the need to make these kinds of posts, especially when they can't get their facts straight.
That's not the only inconsistency in his story.
28/11/13 - $1000 (this is not included in the 18 fortnights I mention below, but just a starting point as reference)
12/12/13 - 868.49
26/12/13 - 730.93
9/1/14 - 819.80
23/1/14 - 807.89
6/2/14 - 768.05
20/2/14 - 582.51
6/3/14 - 664.48
20/3/14 - 591.09
3/4/14 - 440.01
17/4/14 - 500.93
1/5/14 - 458.12
15/5/14 - 448.40
29/5/14 - 570.73
12/6/14 - 605.27
26/6/14 - 574.42
10/7/14 - 617.28
24/7/14 - 607.74
7/8/14 - 587.16
If he had bought $50 worth once every fortnight (18 fortnights), his average price would end up being $624.62/BTC.
About $800-850/BTC if you take into account the initial $1000 for 1 BTC.
The current Coinbase sell price is $585.48.
This post is clearly a complete fabrication designed to try and pump up the price by attracting fresh blood.
Plus if you want to argue that he bought extra at $400 as you say, then that is not proper dollar cost averaging is it? That would just be luck, because he might have backed up the truck as they say when the price dropped to $840, or $700, etc.
