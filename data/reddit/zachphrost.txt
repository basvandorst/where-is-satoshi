Thanks, I made the clarification.

Fuck Wired.

Wow, kudos to you for not putting up with their draconian "curated experience". I too use Apple products with the exception of my phone - Android all the way there. For other reasons than Bitcoin, to be fair; however, the Blockchain app and Coinbase apps are pretty awesome.

I never said you were fear-mongering, and I thank you for the articles. I wouldn't use the word hate, but rather, fear.

Where is any sort of evidence of your ridiculous statement that Apple hates Bitcoin?
EDIT: clarified which part of btcnoodle's statement is ridiculous, since you assholes keep downvoting me
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:52:44
To be perfectly honest, I kind of hope it sways users from iPhone to Android, instead of people begging Apple to adopt BTC-friendly policies. Best way to make a statement is with your wallet, right?

What does lawlessness have to do with free market principles?
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:29:24
Ah, I see. Makes sense.

Leah and Newsweek have already lost all credibility. If she's let go from Newsweek, she'll probably be doing PR for the rest of her life (which is where shitty journalists end up after being canned).

I lol'd when I read this, but felt bad doing so.

Yeah, great idea, have the government step in. They wouldn't do anything to regulate Bitcoin. I mean, look how much money traditional, regulated ForEx makes? &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
@_date: 2013-08-31 15:23:18
Way too long. Can somebody tell me if this is worth reading? 
@_date: 2013-05-10 20:17:24
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:24:59
I'm not getting the reference, please explain.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:44:46
Thank you, i didn't even realize that!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:49:02
Ah, I've never seen the wire. Thanks for the explanation.
