the idea that bitcoin will use all the world's energy is retarded. the fact that it uses energy is what gives bitcoins value, as they have an actual cost to produce a bitcoin. this is in stark contrast to an altcoin that is premined, ad has no value at all because it was created from nothing just like fiat. Bitcoin has work that produces it, hence the name proof of work... proof of stake is insecure and no mining coins are a scam completely

The other conspiracy theory is that bitcoin was invented by AI that has evolved to become sentient and is working to take over by upending the current rulers by taking out the financial powerbase using bitcoin as it's perfect weapon. Literally skynet. also the blockchain is the neural network of the world AI system so as bitcoin and cryptos grow bigger the brain of the AI gets more powerful.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:55:56
Well he did invent it, there was nobody else to mine for a year since nobody else could conceive of the idea, when he shared the idea other people started mining. You have the mining thing backwards the use of energy is what adds the security to the network, it's only expensive now comparatively because we don't have global adoption only like 1-2% of the global market knows what crypto is.

you're not understanding what I am saying. No one uses alts that's why the fees haven't risen. In the long run every altcoin will run into the problems bitcoin currently has, they just haven't yet because they are not being used by anyone, except for speculation. even with the high fees people are continuing to use bitcoin. what does that tell you? the same thing it tells you when alts crater because bitcoin starts moving again. alts are worthless, bitcoin is the only real coin that has use or value. you're calling me the hard head while you demonstrate exactly what my prior comment was talking about, lol. You've only been in crypto for a month, so let's agree that you may not have a very good technical understanding, yet. talk to me when you've been hodling for a few years, because right now your opinion on this is completely worthless, you just don't know what you're talking about.

this argument about altcoins having better tech is completely retarded. they all try to "improve" Bitcoin, by removing it's key security and decentralization features, erroneously thinking they are bugs. They may have created a superficial, faster currency, but it is almost aways centralized or insecure, making it inferior in every way. This is not more advanced tech, it's shittier more convenient tech. These idiot noobs, buy the marketing from the shitcoin pumpers, and eat it up hook line and sinker.

Miners need to sell bitcoin to pay their bills in fiat, so you can contact them and sometimes get a good price if you pick up a large amount, in which what is commonly called an over the counter or otc buy, which is how bulk amounts of bitcoin is traditionally sold. some exchanges even have dedicated otc exchanges.

the pigs in the US stole 9,000 from me, and it would have almost cost more than the money to fight the civil asset forfeiture to get it back, and if I got it back it wouldn't have been the whole amount and I would have had to pay lawyers for the priviledge of trying to get it back. That money was legally earned and they just stole it because they get to keep it, and they know its not worth the trouble to get it back since you'll have to pay legal counsel and end up only getting less than half after fees.

The tax laws are not new. Since Puerto Rico is not a state, it's a US territory, it operates under a different legal spanish-based legal system of their own, and they have their own tax laws. Since it's still a US controlled place US citizens have the right to live their 6 months out of the year in order to qualify for filing their taxes there instead of under the US tax system which will take a much larger cut of the all shitcoin peddlers and scammers that are "building a crypto society".

You can´t stop human nature, people are going to do what they do regardless and they seem to be doing it with bitcoin quite a bit. Your approach is unrealistic.
 Law enforcement can have whatever opinion they want. Good luck enforcing it. 
Bitcoin was invented by Satoshi with Libertarian ideals, that´s what makes bitcoin a killer app and all other alt coins a shitcoin. Once you regulate away the freedom of bitcoin it will instantly become a shitcoin and people will go somewhere else where liberty and security and anonymity are key elements.
 The freedom to transact is a huge part of fungibility.
Look at the mainstream media, facebook and twitter right now, they are under intense scrutiny for censorship. 
Turning bitcoin to shit coin by promoting this fallacy about dirty and clean coins and bowing to the same government and law enforcement tyranny Satoshi was against, is essentially financial censorship. 
It is scary anybody in the bitcoin community would endorce an idea like this, especially when it is a core developer pushing the idea.
Bitcoin needs mainstream acceptance by people not regulators and bankers, and their law enforcers.

No, I haven't heard of this particular company. The craigslist scam went like this:
1. You get hired by a non-descript company with a generic name like "resource services ltd" or something equally unassuming.
2. They send you a cashiers check which is fraudulent, it's for a large sum, like 3k usd. Along with the check you get instructions telling you to cash the check with your bank account, and to send like 90% of the money with western union to someone in the ukraine or phillipines or something who will receive like 2700, and you keep the $300 left over as commission. They tell you it's for some payment service, or international payroll or some BS to get you to cash the check, by making you think it's a legit business.
3. You get arrested for cashing a false check an charged with fraud, and they keep the money you sent them.
This happened to me a bunch of times, when i was looking for jobs on craigslist a few years back. I would get hired for some company then they would email me telling they sent me a document in the mail with a check for my services, and it would piss me off because I would waste my time mailing resumes, emailing, etc and it would be a stupid scam job. 
here's a reddit thread about it:

Coinbase is on the wrong side of every single bitcoin related issue every single time. Bryan Armstrong is completely incompetent, and an enemy of bitcoin, pro ethereum fanboy. The only company shittier than coinbase in all of crypto is xapo. Any crypto biz that requires kyc/aml or reporting taxes to authorities is part of the problem, not the solution. BTC is not paypal!

Legal tender laws are a scam to make merchants be legally forced to accept worthless fiat instead of being free to demand sound money like gold or bitcoin. Legal tender laws is the state telling you no you can't only accept real money (e.g. gold or BTC) you must accept ponzi confetti or be guilty of a crime. Also fightning for freedom or voluntary association is the exact opposite of being forced to pay taxes or tribute to a state violence monopoly

Was she your wife in 2011 (or when you decided to invest in btc)? Or did you make an investment before she even entered your life, that had absolutely nothing to do with her? It's a world of difference, if you guys made the investment decision together. OP made an investment prior to knowing his wife. She did not assist or support him in this decision. For all we know, your wife could have been the one nagging you to finally just buy some bitcoin, against your judgement.

when I have bought in person from a fellow go to meeting member I had met the person in the group and usually purchased before during or after the meeting over coffee while we chatted and waited for the confirmation. I am not going to take a risk with someone I don't know, it's better to buy from a friend or aquaintence or just use localbitcoins, and do the cash deposit escrow payment with a reputable vendor even if it's a little more expensive. you pay for the convenience.

yes it's a site. local bitcoins is the safest way but it's a bit pricey. every time I have used it (over 20 times). I have always searched for vendors with over a 100 transactions and a 100% (or damn close) approval rating on those transactions. You can see the reviews other people have left for each vendor. Only do business with reputable ones. I always did a cash deposit (bank/western union) and when they verified my payment, my coins were released.

Coinbase is garbage, has a history of attacking bitcoin and its users, and security is not good as evidenced by their analytics vendor selling user data to 3rd parties, to which they tried to hide, and resolve by hiring hacking team. If you want to destroy your privacy and anonymity by using them go for it, but I will not give them my business because they cannot be trusted.

Hi u/belcher I tried to answer you on medium but I guess they don't like me anymore. Here is my response:  
You’re right, it does depend on your threat model, but an anonymity set  of 50 was the consensus given to Nopara73 when he was consulting with  security experts on designing Wasabi Wallet, as a sufficiently  tumbled/anonymous coin. ( I deferred to this post for the anonymity set  50 info: [  An anonymity set of 50 may not protect you from police if you live in a  Police state like the US or UK, but I would like to see them kick 50  doors in 50 different countries in order to investigate. Doesn’t seem  realistic to me.

I think we are already in the very early stages of hyperbitcoinization. The genie is out of the bottle. Bitcoin is globally adopted and is not going anywhere. we are at the earliest stages of mass adoption. I think it will happen without much of a struggle because it will be something that cannot be stopped like streaming tv/movies killing cable companies. Banks will have their ripple shitcoin which may be adopted by a fair amount of people but in the end people will choose the permissionless decentralized &amp; private option so they don't have to deal with the shitty kyc/aml excuse to restrict your financial freedom and fleece your account with fees.
