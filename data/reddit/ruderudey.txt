You don’t need to buy a full BTC. You can buy as little as 1/100,000,000th of one. Practically speaking as little as $1 equivalent worth at most bitcoin ATMs.

Yes they hold your payment and force you to verify id before you can redeem the coinstar code and redeem for bitcoin. I am not a fan since a lot of beginners can get their funds stuck paying for a code that they can’t use unless they upload their license. It seems like coinme is hiding this fact. At least with BTMs they won’t take money without sending Btc.

How about their FX rate? 4% sell is a pretty decent fee.
@_date: 2019-06-17 03:15:41
How much lower was the selling price than say Coinbase.

BTW LibertyX has debit card ATMs in addition to kiosks. I’ve never see a LibertyX kiosks but have seen plenty of their ATMs.
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:04:57
If it works as a debit card, check out LibertyX ATMs. Just use the gift card PIN.
@_date: 2019-12-13 23:20:30
Check out a LibertyX atm and use your debit card. Is instant.

I meant the price. For example btm buy price of 9500 when Coinbase is buy at 9200. Or btm sell price of 8900 when Coinbase is at 9100. The price is another way a lot of operators get you to effectively pay more

Use your debit card at LibertyX ATMs. It is instant but you need to go to one of their ATMs. They have thousands at least...so tough for us lazies that want to buy from home.
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:37:19
Do they transfer to your bank?
@_date: 2015-10-06 20:51:35
Anyone tried these guys yet? Might have to give them a go.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:32:57
8% total from my experience. They don’t pad the FX rate though.  Same price for cash or debit card which is unique. Price is basically the same as Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:16:31
You can’t use change at the machine for bitcoin which surprised me since isn’t that the whole point of coinstar lol
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:51:36
Check out libertyx and see if they have a location near you. They have stores and traditional atms that accept debit card for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:05:49
Have you looked at libertyx or localbitcoin? Libertyx is cash and debit and has traditional atms that sell bitcoin as well as cashiers. Localbitcoins you go and meet a stranger in person to exchange.
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:15:40
LibertyX probably has a local store/ATM near you to buy bitcoin in person. Would recommend in person if you are worried about trust.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:08:09
Yes, this! Next time use a service like LibertyX where you can pick the transaction fee so it’s not stuck in limbo. They also have cashiers and traditional ATMs you can buy bitcoin in person. Better yet use a non-custodial wallet as well so you can CPFP or RBF!

Their KYC process was atrocious. I still can’t access my $300 “voucher”. Been waiting for support for almost 2 weeks now. For me if you are buying bitcoin and want to use cash/gift cards = localbitcoins, if you want to use debit = libertyx
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:45:33
Local bitcoin ATM buy with cash, LibertyX buy with debit cards is my jam. Strange world when debit cards are CHEAPER than CASH!
@_date: 2019-05-03 01:17:32
What service was it? I’ve seen a lot of retail store cashiers use LibertyX to sell bitcoin to consumers.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:12:32
Yeah parent would be easiest. You’d need their debit card or bank acc though
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:11:59
Check out libertyx or another bitcoin atm
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:13:39
Check out libertyx. You can buy bitcoin by using your debit card at regular ATMs and also from cashiers. Pretty sure it showed up as libertyx when I tried on my card.
@_date: 2019-05-04 18:18:56
How would coinme make money? They probably had to give up almost half the company equity to even get this deal done. Coinstar charges a lot as well
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:32:36
Well for starters I wouldn’t tell the side you are using it for gambling. As I understand it the big boys will block you
@_date: 2019-05-28 20:27:12
+1 for libertyx.com for both cash and debit card
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:00:34
Check out libertyx
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:51:02
Check out libertyx. Can’t beat the trustworthiness of going to a real ATM, not a bitcoin kiosk thing.
