"Within" is not a hyphenated word, therefore I cannot respect your chart, since you are obviously uneducated. ;)

1) You sell it at a higher price
2) You buy bitcoin and transfer it to an exchange to trade it for a different crypto. Binance is a good exchange.
3) Of course
4) Coinbase, cash app (square). I believe cashapp is the cheaper of the two. OTC (over the counter) and from friends with crypto who need cash is another way to buy some coins.

I dont use PayPal, so I'm not certain about that process, but I do know that Coinbase recently added a PayPal interface.

What a poorly written article....

I agree. Most people are extremely tunnelvisoned, incapable of thinking outside of the box, are closed minded and fear change.
But most people are also innate followers with herd mentality, rarely questioning what they are told, and complacent to a rank and file archaic system of government control. They cannot wrap their feeble minds around alternative paradigmatic systems to the ones they were born into; monetary systems being one such paradigm. Thus, they perpetuate a broken system without questioning or challenging the underpinnings of the system itself. 
We are at the concrescence of technological and informational advancement. The house of cards will fall, the only questions are when and how. The sheeple will have to tag along for the ride, but those of us with a bit of foresight will be out in front of the masses.

just invest what you can afford to lose...and if you lose, at least you tried.
....but if you win MOON

Nothing is "wrong" with that per se, it's more of a philosophical matter. We need fiat to go extinct in terms of societal (worldwide) belief; a paradigm change. That is what I was trying to convey.

Bitcoin itself will not break the economy. If there is a global economic reset/global economic crash, people MAY adopt crypto as a means to conduct business following such a crash (and the chaos and turmoil that would accompany it).  
However, if the world transitions away from the US dollar as the worldwide currency (which seems to be slowly happening currently), and the world economy doesn't crash throughout that transition, things could get interesting for crypto also.
With regard to your questions about people with currently heavy bags of BTC...they are already rich. Adding a couple of zeros on the end of their balance doesn't change much for the majority of people (who will be late to the game).
Remember, if all 21,000,000 BTC were evenly distributed amongst the entire world population, each person would have ~0.003 BTC, meaning, if you currently own just 1 BTC, you are VASTLY ahead of the late comers.

When you (and the majority of all people) stop thinking of Bitcoin in terms of fiat value, that is when Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) will be "the thing".  
People have a hard time letting go of their belief in the current paradigm of fiat currency. The transition will take time.
When Keyboards no longer have the "$" symbol, and it is replaced with the BTC symbol....that will be a good indicator.
