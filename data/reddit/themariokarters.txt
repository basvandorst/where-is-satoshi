No, you’ll be lucky to break even
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:38:35
brother you’ll be posting this for centuries 
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:29:31
Imagine calling someone scum because of their political affiliation
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:02:35
If what you just said is even remotely true, it would be priced into BTC already. Let’s be somewhat rational here
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:31:08
This is a horrible train of thought 
@_date: 2019-07-31 15:03:22
That’s literally gambling. You just defined it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:35:22
with united states dollhairs
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:38:02
lol i could easily recognize some profits from buying dips earlier today.... but nah
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:13:14
instant. as in, you’ll instantly lose money trying to do this 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:31:03
buy le dip
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:48:12
just saw some big buyers on GDAX... momentum seems solid 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:30:03
XBT.1 (January futures contract) now trading at $18.6k and rapidly rising 
edit: XBT.2 (February contract) is trading at nearly $18.9k. Wall St. is bullish!
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:26:02
Coinbase plz let me buy jesus christ lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:53:24
No. I kind of like that it makes you hold it
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:43:27
You guys are unbelievable lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:08:50
I tried again and it works 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:34:15
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:34:32
trusted my gut
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:37:59
No idea. But i’m gonna buy some if it corrects lol
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:40:34
about 6,034
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:27:27
My personal opinion: Bitcoin futures launch at 6pm EST will have little to no negative impact on price today. Futures are traded and settled in cash. If anything, price should go up. In essence, people buying futures will be betting on the price of BTC at various points in the future. Explain to me why anyone would buy puts or sell calls on this thing?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:07:01
Finite supply + high demand = high price. Not super complicated 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:52:15
i’m not just day trading. i’m holding BTC (and LTC and ETH) for the long term. however, i trade the ETH/BTC and LTC/BTC ratios to scrape some profits. at the end of the day, volatility is a sign of a healthy free market 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:01:27
we should chew through that 19k sell wall pretty soon
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:58:35
How would you pay capital gains tax without any gains?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:39:02
price stabilizing now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:37:08
yeah. just bought a chunk
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:16:22
seems like a weird way to do it. why buy at 16.2 if you think it’ll drop to 14?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:42:35
It doesn’t. Go to their website 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:17:00
It’s actual bullshit man. And it’s legal 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:34:50
TA really doesn’t apply to speculative assets
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:07:23
just look at how many trades are taking place right now on gdax, this is insane 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:51:52
seems like $17.3k is yesterday’s $16.6k
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:07
If you can’t separate delusional from disillusional, i think i can do without your opinion 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:16:41
for example, LTC/BTC on GDAX is a market where you can exchange LTC for BTC (and vice versa) at a given exchange rate. i’ve been day trading them and scraping profits, really fun lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:32:03
But they didn’t follow BTC. Happened all at the same time 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:19:55
it went from basically a peak of $19k to $13.5k, that’s a 40% correction, seems legit to me 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:51:15
Buy/sell using limit orders as a market maker on GDAX. No fees 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:44:39
watching GDAX charts is far too addicting 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:33:40
think of it as a buying opportunity 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:25
"Purchases disabled" on coinbase OKAY
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:04:51
The CBOE website is down. Demand is off the charts
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:22:40
it’s your money man, i wish you all the luck in the world :) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:11:11
how do i transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:27:09
take my upvote 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:50:09
Law of large numbers. Bitcoin won’t go up 100% in a day anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:16:54
Yes. In contracts the number represents the expiration month. XBT.2 would be Feb ‘18 expiry.
XBT.1 at $18.2k and and XBT.2 at $18.4k right now. I’ve been watching them all morning at work, keeps rising
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:48:37
he fucked up. you don’t sell an appreciating asset
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:53:18
No, other way around
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:11:52
not true 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:44:19
Because there is no information that is unavailable to the public. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:08:14
why’s that?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:32:36
Coinbase has been the most downloaded app on the App Store. People see $17k and they see $300, which do you think they’ll buy?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:08:54
i’m watching gdax prices and there is definitely something different with where trades are settling 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:18:52
i sent BTC from GDAX to Binance a couple hours ago and it hasn’t even fucking shown up as a pending transaction yet on Binance. ETH took 10 minutes. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:13:49
It dipped into the $13ks earlier 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:28:38
no one knows man...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:36:31
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:22:05
they already have as far as i’m concerned 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:18:49
$15k seems to be a support level.. i’m not big on technical analysis but for what it’s worth 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:49:38
haha yeah man. i’m not gonna tell people what to do with their money, but i know what i’m doing with mine. there are so many amazing projects out there, i’ve been using BTC the last couple weeks to buy them 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:31:50
It reached $19k a few days ago and corrected 40% to $13.5k
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:09:55
how do we transfer?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:10:55
most of the money* coinbase fees are absurd
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:56:59
yes, but it’s 5 contracts. that’s essentially meaningless
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:00:10
Every trade has a buyer and a seller, it’s a zero-sum game. There is no “money” unaccounted for. If i buy 1 BTC, someone has to sell 1 BTC. The money leaves my account and goes to theirs 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:08:21
it would get reinvested 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:09:49
i gradually did this over the last week 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:29:26
wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:23

Unable to identify from my license, try again?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:39:24
wow crazy selloff, you can see the sell orders pouring in on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:28:26
nah i’ll hodl, thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:51:08
bro lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:03:19
it moved to LTC lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:26:15
idk about *the* dip but seemed like a good buying opportunity to me 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:19:38
Same mechanism 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:21:16
Bro... why would you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:14:11
Went $19.2 to $15.3 today. Back at $17k. Fortunately was able to time it 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:10:39
24 hour trading volume is about half what it was around this time yesterday. that’s probably attributable to it being the weekend, but just an observation 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:40:06
Lovely, thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:54:45
LTC be like “look at me, i am the BTC now”
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:25
I was trying to at $15.2k but Coinbase is broken 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:16:16
it haunted me for a while. then i bought back in and now we’re here! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:02:27
the 24 hr volume is really low compared to what it’s been lately... would make the price more susceptible to larger moves 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:00:50
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:09:34
thanks, unchecked every damn box 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:55:59
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:27:04
it’s more volatile than it was earlier today..
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:29:10
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:20:08
No one gives a fuck buddy 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:58:18
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:43:43
Do you only post garbage like this?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:53:11
you'll be waiting a very long time then
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:17:54
yes, i am being stupid by exploiting movements in the ratio to increase my BTC holdings. good job 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:20:44
Coinbase fake dips are so annoying lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:52:07
his point is: why would you want to convert BTC to USD when BTC should be far more valuable in the future?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:02:53
i’m so fed up with coinbase omg
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:05:56
She lives!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:59
finally broke thru $16k
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:19:47
East coast wakes up?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:53:23
If you go to the identify document page it’ll say unconfirmed 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:49:40
too bad we can’t move it fast enough to benefit lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:32:04
do yourself a favor and don’t take anything that dude says seriously 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:03:20
Nice move there!
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:23:14
woah, HELLO rally!
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:56:24
Dear BTC “hodl”ers, are you guys actively buying as well or just holding on to what you have?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:07:39
i believe futures have stabilized BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:48:24
i do this too. it’ll work until it doesn’t lol 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:39:02
lol. unless you on living for another 120 years then why would you care what happens after all BTC has been mined?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:32:39
Slightly racist and pretty funny. Nice
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:05:07
I am doing it with ETH and just decided to keep a lot of the ETH i bought below 0.04 instead of swapping back into BTC!
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:06:14
yea it was down for a min 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:19:38
it’s gone. called it!
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:53:59
i hope so haha. i’m just trying to add in chunks whenever i think i see a dip 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:06:20
that was underwhelming!
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:49:57
You can’t even buy on exchanges if you’re a minor, so wouldn’t be an issue anyway 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:02:04
i’m thinking the wall street money deliberately stabilized the price.. hmm this isn’t good 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:32:42
lmao found the $19k buyer 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:46:35
thanks man. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:03:32
The biggest bubble of our time is the equity market propped up by qualitative easing. You can thank the Fed for that one 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:20:32
shut up and BTFD 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:33:44
Good or bad idea to keep adding small chunks at mini dips like the one today to increase my overall cost basis and lower my taxable gains (when they come)?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:36:42
:) same here 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:33:18
i moved 90% of my BTC over the past week. do the same 
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:47:20
lol i just woke up to see some orders from last night get executed... made my week’s income if i really wanted to convert it to filthy government money 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:34:37
You’re a national treasure 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:42:40
All would say that 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:03:40
dude.... 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:20:19
Honestly it’s really cool sitting here watching my net worth go up lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:13:42
it says 297 on coinbase but 350 something if you try and buy it. now coinbase is down edit: back to normal now 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:53:02
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:38:19
she’s been range-bound btwn ~$14k-$16k lately... looking to see a breakthrough in either direction 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:34:42
very clever idea
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:56:10
“Mr father in law, you are a dumbass”
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:26:54
Rallying on net neutrality news?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:49:26
t minus 10 min till i have that feeling 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:14:47
That’s not insider trading. And it’s not artificial, if the value goes up then it goes up 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:57:51
No joke 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:41:41
lol yes. i don’t like it, i think a CMT is a joke, but TA does have some use when used with fundamental analysis 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:26
good, i’ll buy more then
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:18
What do you use?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:47:17
there will be in the new tax bill. it will be a taxable event 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:41:56
i can’t even buy the fucking dip come on coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:53:49
there is no need to be patient. projects such as RaiBlocks have 0 fees and instant transactions, right now, today 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:11:47
Elaborate 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:29:56
This is almost as bad lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:56
well, there’s your dip 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:48:21
January futures are ripping
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:52:29
Coinbase continues to do shady shit to prop up BCH, what else is new?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:32:46
GDAX is so fun
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:18:45
lol bye bye
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:15
Try before the end of the day
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:23:58
i’m more or less in the same boat as you. buy dips like this morning and do not sell is my move
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:22:40
It’s just you. The SEC is a regulator. Regulation is not good 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:26:59
Or this thing skyrockets from the inflow of institutional money and you lose out big time. We just don’t know. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:21:18
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:58:34
LTC 3 days ago, lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:25:29
BCH continues to pump..
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:41:26
they’ll do the same tonight when futures launch lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:57:59
I’ve been successful twice in the last day, i don’t think day trading is the issue here
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:00:15
Seems like BTC is losing some momentum or am i just in my own head?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:54:09
I have some dirt cheap Bitcoin Trash orders in place, let’s get this party started 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:49:26
because coinbase makes money off us
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:12:13
i imagine normies will be buying today with their paychecks
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:58:55
No you can’t. It’s against their Terms of Service and they will freeze your account 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:31:28
yeah i do. i have been watching the depth charts, there was more sell pressure at 19k than there is at 20k and the 19k wall got demolished
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:04:16
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:50:53
oh no we found support at a high price... this isn’t a bad thing 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:44:19
Looking forward to a nice day at “work” today lol
I wonder how much productivity has been lost in the past few weeks in offices across the world?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:25:02
Fuck Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:23:55
the dream is alive
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:18:31
RIP $15.5k resistance 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:56:14
I guess it’s a good thing Coinbase wouldn’t let me buy at $16k lol. This is such an attractive dip 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:42:40
please do yourself a favor and stop. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:53:12
yes, that represents 1 BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:57
bought more sub 17k. you clowns talking about selling and weak hands do not belong in this market, go do something else lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:03:56
still dipping 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:33:24
yeah that’ll work well /s
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:07:49
Lmfao get out of here 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:24:28
i don’t think it’s a coincidence that BTC is trading essentially in line with January futures contracts.. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:48:37
absolutely 
i can’t even focus on my job anymore, probably gonna get fired and end up trading BTC futures lol 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:54:46
yeah... imma place a 15k limit sell just in case lol 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:01:55
Dude yes!! I woke up to see some orders executed from last night, made about a week’s worth of profit if i wanted to convert it into filthy government money
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:25:11
Time in is more important than timing 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:09:29
Yes you can, into a USD wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:22:53
you silly 
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:47:39
i really wish people would stop posting garbage like this
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:57:08
they aren’t just influencing it, they’re determining it 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:22:58
price history, not the charts. maybe i’m just reading too much into it
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:28:29
You as well 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:14:08
lol 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:09:55
Finite supply + high demand = high price 
We’ll all be dead by then anyway lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:08:04
GDAX pays the fee so yeah i’m chilling 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:39:30
how is someone gonna hack funds that are stored offline lol
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:28:15
it’s so trash. it took me 5 hours to move BTC from one exchange to another, 10 min for ETH and 20 min for LTC. BTC is archaic and useless. 
full disclosure: i’ve owned BTC for a while, but dont plan on having much, or any, soon

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:11
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:16:09

you can sell the same bitcoin on GDAX for a much lower fee
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:33:03
CME futures live in 30 min yeah?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:07:05

@_date: 2017-12-16 23:25:25

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:13:14

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:08:50
XBT.1 at $18,190 right now. i’m down!
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:27:24
OP plz buy so i can buy more 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:20:47
this is incorrect. trading globally starts in about an hour 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:50:39
i don’t know lol. but i use coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:30:48
here we go
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:53:57
this thing is ripping!
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:50:52
a coin you’ll be very glad you decided to buy 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:06:31
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:05
I hope y’all took advantage of that buying opportunity!
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:42:49
Jim Cramer is a fucking hack.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:00:19
333.33 in BTC ETH and LTC 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:51:20
yes. i don’t want reduced volatility lol, volatility is good for trading.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:27:16
No, because that is when you hold and not day trade lol. Again, day trading is not the problem 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:14:34
yes, no
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:51:06
Coinbase makes money off noobs 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:29:43
yes, i am aware
the main criticisms of BTC are time and fee, my emphasis was on the 30 minutes it took to transfer. i’ve seen people post here about waiting days..
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:18
If you sold it all at $19.5k and bought back at $16.9k now you’d be pretty happy 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:12:10
yes, i cashed out in 2013. you live and learn. no point in thinking about what ifs
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:43:12
Yes, but unscheduled 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:28:47
little buying opp here?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:22:51
10% of Gates’ worth is in MSFT stock 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:08:07
hope y’all put your seatbelts on
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:42:23
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:06:22
apparently the info wasn’t very good...
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:08:17
Glad i was able to get a chunk at $15.3 earlier then :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:03:57
I’m looking forward to going home so that i can trade and scrape some profits lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:30:25
GDAX getting flooded with buy orders right now 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:57:26
Already happened today lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:45:56
No one is saying that either. Keep your nonsense to yourself 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:17:15
yeah 6pm EST
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:22:26
??? red is good, buy
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:39:31
Yup. This would drive the price up!
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:20:35
well damn, well done. i didnt even get that option 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:28:21
Indeed. I bought a chunk at $14.2k yesterday but i am inclined to move to the sidelines for now 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:09:51
i’m not messing with the ratio at these levels tbh. i have buys set up at the 0.040 and below levels
also it’s cool to talk about this shit with someone, my friends IRL would look at me like i’m a fuckin maniac lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:43
We’re on track 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:50:03
nice. i’ve been using it to buy LTC and ETH
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:21:11
Yeah i feel you there. I’ve been doing it with LTC too, fun stuff 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:28:00
Lmao Coinbase really won’t open trading because they know Bitcoin Trash is going to free fall. Check out the order book 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:17:57
i don’t like how these motherfuckers do business.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:46
i do
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:12:57
lmfaooooo 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:55:26
no not even that. look at this bullshit 
this is collusion
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:28:50
what if there isn’t another dip? we don’t know what’s gonna happen
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:24:55
hope y’all bought that dip earlier
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:41
i sent BTC from GDAX to two different exchanges, for free, and it took about 30 min each time. maybe i’m just lucky?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:29:33
I might be right and i might be wrong, that’s the beauty of this. My plan is to not sell anything and either 1) hold and ride it up or 2) watch it crash and buy more on the big dip if it happens 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:59:58
you can’t buy half a share...
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:43:00
got a chunk at $14.2k, hopefully timed it right lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:25:43
BTC, ETH, and LTC all just followed the same price movement. wtf?
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:32:03
futures are settled in cash, not in BTC. they’re just bets on BTC
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:26:11
a sleeping giant. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:22:04
because trading was suspended until noon EST 
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:35:03
anyone else disturbed by the fact that spot price is being determined by futures price?
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:35:34
Well, the US housing price index is currently at an all-time high (266 vs. about 224 pre-recession in 2007 and indexed 100 in 1990). So, no, it will not be a stable investment. Housing prices will fall. More stable than bitcoin? Probably!
@_date: 2019-11-27 16:48:11
You’ve nailed it. You’re ready for your 3rd grade math exam now
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:22:39
We already have those. Just don’t have the federal regulations around them 
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:55:19
Lol the government doesn’t give a shit about your new model
@_date: 2018-10-28 15:53:04
BSA/AML you freakin weirdo 
@_date: 2019-11-07 17:19:48
That’s how you want it to work, but you know it’s not true
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:44:55
Tells people to ignore FUD but can’t do basic math. Awesome. 
155% return

The bubble is in your head, where your brain should be. Do you understand what debt is?
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:56:33
Or lose
@_date: 2019-02-25 14:14:31
IT’S TIME BITCOIN FOR PLAN
@_date: 2019-02-28 17:01:30
He’s also assuming that OP didn’t convert to fiat before purchasing, which is probably exactly what he did 
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:50:45
This will ruin “crypto” for mainstream people who have no idea what it is
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:21:03
Elon Musk says a lot of stupid bullshit, this being part of that 
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:53:48
Are you blind?
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:55:54
Yeah baby casual racism whoohooooo
@_date: 2018-11-07 15:02:41
Yikes. Gottem
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:20:08
That’s not how losses work. You haven’t lost ANYTHING

Fight Club isn’t gay porn you specimen. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 20:54:06
Sorry, but that’s just fucking stupid. Total waste
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:29:50
Banks don’t save your funds, silly boy. They use them to make loans and generate returns on your funds
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:17:51
Sounds like you have no basic understand of economic principles then
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:45:35
Yes, that is high
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:40:39

Oxford comma god damn it. No one says Bitcoin is for buying criminals
@_date: 2019-05-14 15:50:43
You’re literally just putting words together and forming nonsense statements
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:43:56
Are you sensible tho?
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:32:27
I don’t think you understand how anything works if you actually believe that.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:25:34
Maybe hire a fucking lawyer?
