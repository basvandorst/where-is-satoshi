Wow, thankfully I haven't seen a loss like that since I sat down in khakis.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:47:28
Oh... that means it's funny, right?
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:40:22
I saw that image but I didn't get why it was funny. Care to explain to a bumbling oaf?
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:16:22
Still no credit/debit? Do what?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:45:41
Holy shit?
Wasn't gold at $1,700-ish just last week?

Next time you wanna throw away some hard drives, just PM me and I'll send you a prepaid box to ship them in.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:17:23
Haha awesome. Thanks, stranger.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:38:45
Seriously, how the fuck do you accidentally throw away a million-dollar hard drive? 
@_date: 2013-11-13 10:23:22
How does one go about doing that?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:22:37
Cheers, guys. 
A toast to every kind redditor who helped the rest of us every step of the way.
Thank you all
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:15:26
So... one ten-thousandth of a dollar?
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:47:17
Ah-ohhhh ok, thanks. I remember seeing a lot of "I ordered _______ 7 weeks ago and..." posts a while back.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:29:16
it's anyone's guess. my guess is yes.
i bought yesterday at nearly 900. I made a hundred bucks in my sleep.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:04:13
It would be easier to accidentally throw away my car.
How many times a day does the average person throw away a hard drive?
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:59:49
No offense, but you're going to need something a little more... viral. I'm willing to toss around ideas with some people if anyone else wants to collaborate.

I used to work in IT and I would never mix up a work hdd with a personal hdd...
Unless I was using work hdds as personal hdds.

How much USD do you invest altogether?
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:57:55
I would do this, but I'd rather spend a few minutes to make sure I'm buying at a good price.

TW: Complaining
What the **FUCK**? Since I very first decided I would invest in bitcoin I've dealt with nothing but red tape and road blocks. I thought I would just, you know, buy some. Now here I am a month later with all my savings, two new bank accounts, a fully updated bio ready to submit to the internet, a scanner, a printer, android apps, a VPN subscription, hot wallets, cold wallets, several new programs, a fucking virus, several ominous fortune cookies and bottle caps and a metric fuckton of stress. I've watched BTC quadruple since I started, and now, as I'm scanning documents and importing them to a folder to send off, just so I can wait another week, I learn that my exchange is defunct.
Is this God? Is that what this is? Is God telling me not to buy bitcoins? Why, God? Just give me a fucking straight answer for once!
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:19:28
sorry, but, what do you mean?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:14:11
... and my laughter echoed through my empty home
