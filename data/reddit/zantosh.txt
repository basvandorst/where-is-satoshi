I'm going to have to bear the fees, right? It's not the taxes that I'm concerned with.

Yea I'd pay anyway he's happy to get paid, but the cost of paying someone on a wire is really high.  Hence the exploration of Bitcoin as an option.

If Uber is so awesome, I'm still trying to figure out how they make money. I mean, they're basically hiring the limo drivers so they're either paying them market rates, meaning Uber runs a loss, or they're paying them less, meaning the drivers will likely have their peak demand times when they don't need to go through Uber. Sounds to me like either way, making money with their model isn't possible.

We are going to introduce the billing and payment systems in version 2, and yes we plan on accepting bitcoin. We will, of course, accept other forms of payment.
Our plan is to give users the choice. As we are a platform, and have no intention of becoming a car service, it's our goal to give you - the user - a choice in how you want to run your rideshare, and what sort of payments you want to accept.
I think it's really fantastic what we can do and I'm really excited.

Yeah you wouldn't want it to be random. Try out RideConnect. Our platform is specifically private and it's designed to allow you to control which drivers are in your rideshare. 
Pretty much with RideConnect, you can create your own version of Uber for your business.

We're already doing blockchain based identity validation. It's actually coming up in our version 2.0.

Care to elaborate? Where did you use it and how were you cheated? Our app isn't a car service and you can't connect with strangers in our app. 
Please clarify.

Omg you don't know this guy? He was the comic relief during the invasion. He'd say shit and sometimes the opposite would be happening literally behind him. I'd watch the news just for this guy. I hope he got a career in comedy after the fall of the regime.

That's just messed up. I'm sure for the bank, they're doing a big fuck you because using bitcoin threatens their business.

Alright so let's just clear the air here. There's literally no point of any tech if the user can't use it. All our tech, even if you think it's shitty, takes UX into account first. If you don't agree with me then consider this. 
India. Tech savvy country. Those guys literally ignore UX in favor of writing code. This results in websites and various other tech that works but not for the end user. It works for the people who made the tech. 
Banks, railways, even airlines. If you come from the West, then you'll get frustrated with the tech there. It's not because the tech doesn't work nor is it because it looks bad. It's that the UX was totally ignored. 
So yeah Jobs was starting a fact. That's really how it's always been done. And India is an example of how it turns out when you ignore UX.
