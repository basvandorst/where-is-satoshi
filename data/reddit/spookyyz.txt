Thanks for that.  Next dumb question is there a way to tell if it is a segwit address or a pre-segwit address?

Hasn't baboom been launched?  Or at least soft launched.  Also, I thought Kim was out of that venture?

I mean I understand not understanding the whole ecosystem is not the greatest thing when speaking to a technology in that world, but everyone is dismissing his analysis of Bitcoin on the grounds that he doesn't know what an ICO is?  I'm not sure how that counters his analysis of the Bitcoin bubble.  In fact, I think he would contend, that dismissing his thoughts on the bubble by saying "he doesn't know what an ICO is lol" strengthens his argument of the psyche of the Bitcoin participant being someone who 'gets it' and any contention simply dismissed as 'not understanding'.
I would love to hear people's thoughts on this.

Markets don't exist in a vacuum, they are all subject to humans and their (pretty predictable) behaviors.  To say someone doesn't understand crypto with his background in economic markets and their actions is very shortsighted.

I guess my 'problem' for lack of a better word, is that these turn times should be quoted post purchase, it should all be part of the purchase summary.  If you tried to this in any other financial setting it would in fact be quite a problem.
Also, I transfer money for investment to a few different entities, and have never dealt with anything near a 1 week turn time.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:04:15
Ya, I see that now, thanks for the information.  If the price is indeed locked, I'm much more comfortable with the whole thing.  But the lack of clarity is concerning.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:16:27
I did, but I haven't received the 2 verification charges as of  yet.
edit: just got those and verified them.

That does not appear to be applying to me, as that note was not there when I made my purchase.  It appears, I'm quoting the "message" of my transaction, that I am locked in at $1,076.73 including fees.
But, having read a bit more into the troubles of coinbase, the practice of accepting purchase now on the prospect of future gains and then cancelling out your purchase for being "high risk" when the market goes up is incredibly concerning.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:56:06
I am not seeing a cancellation button.  When I view the pending transaction there is nothing of the sort.  Where does this option normally appear?
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:53:11
Where is this option?  This is what I am not seeing.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:05:14
Thanks for the information, just updated the profile.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:38:06
It must have something specifically to do with coinbase then.  This is what my coinbase account is saying, in regards to the purchase:
November 28, 2013, at 09:08AM PST
Your BTC will arrive on Thursday Dec 5, 2013 around 10:08AM PST.
There must be some significance to it being exactly 1 week and 1 hour, hopefully someone can shed some light on that.
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:49:42
This is a fair point.  I would still like the ability to cancel the pending transaction should I decide to.  That is really the heart of the issue, is the lack of an option to cancel a pending transaction in light of new information which was not available at the time of purchase.
It still seems a bit excessive to have a 5 business day turn time to buy something that is so volatile.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:04:29
You are comical.  The "high risk" email is the email you get when there's a problem with the bank transfer?  That makes TONS of sense.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:50:46
When I made my purchase, and granted this is unable to be confirmed for the most part, the message stating there will be a delay was not appearing.  I simply would like the option to cancel my pending transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:08:21
This should be disclosed on their purchase order.  But, fair point.
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:49:52
I'm not sure I buy that as the exclusive reason.  I deal with plenty of investment institutions that take ACH transfers from the same account, and the clearance time is usually the same business day, usually a matter of a few hours and they have the same, if not more, regulatory overhead (speculation, but I would imagine that to be the case). 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:18:33
Weird, their support site gives another explanation:  
The only reference even made to the bank is because they accept ACH transfers, which are recallable by the sender.  The rest is a magical world of proprietary algorithms that tell them if it is "high risk" or not.
Do your research.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:46:45
I see no option for instant buy?  Where can I access that?
The "You'll be happy in a week if the price goes up" statement is a little concerning as well.  I'd be much more happy if the price went up in a week where I had access to the BTC.  I'm not sure how a week turn time would be acceptable to any financial institution.  Further, if there were to be that type of turn time, to at least allow you to cancel a pending transaction if you don't wish to wait that long would be an absolute must.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:30:38
but merely trying to sell you thing you want to buy........ assuming they don't stand to make more off your money by returning it to you at a later time and then calling your transaction "high risk".
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:44:02
Of course, if the price is locked in.  That was the confusion, I was under the impression (from the note displayed shortly after my purchase) that the amount was not locked in and I would be subject to the price come December 5.  Since the price I agreed to has been locked, it is not as big a problem.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:28:03
Delivery time quotes.  Not the amount of BTC nor the price paid, those were not the concern.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:07:53
Now that I see the price is locked in my concern is far less.  My understanding (by the note that appeared after my purchase) previously was bitcoin was going to sit on my 1.00BTC purchase and then sell it to me at whatever it is come December 5th.  THAT was my main concern, given that that is not the case (although I still have a problem with how they are representing this information) I am fine with the whole thing for the most part.  I still think the turn time is disappointing though.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:59:34
The latter part of your statement was more of the confusion.  Though, I still stand by that ON THE ORDER FORM it should state that based on the status of your account you will receive the coin on XYZ date.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:39:53
I really hope this is not an accurate representation of the infrastructure surrounding bitcoins.  Unfortunately, this is my first personal experience with bitcoins so I can't accurately speak on the topic.  I also realize there is a fair amount of volume given the boom in interest in the recent days, but if the volume cannot be handled by the infrastructure surrounding it, that is very concerning in and of itself.
@_date: 2013-11-28 18:52:11
New here, being reddit?  Not really at all, I did read multiple sites with regards to the purchasing of BTC and many of them do in fact recommend coinbase.  In this subreddit, if you click the "How to buy bitcoins" link on the sidebar, you are directed to  which recommends it as the  site.
