Pfff, I’ll be paying in a shit load... wishful thinking though.

Hmmm I dunnno, during the bull run, Coinbase took a SHIT on everyone.  True story.

If you don’t mine when the market is down. You may just need to give up on your mining ordeals all together. Heater this heater that, heat my crotch guys. You make me sick. How else is this crypto market going to stay afloat? Do you want everyone else to sit back and not have transactions go through or WHAT! Get a grip...asshat.

Not at all, it’s a bull market

I'd have disagree, it depends on the situation. GDax is still funded by your bank account , which causes delays. Delays cost thousands at any given moment. Paying a fee from coin base is sometimes more beneficial. It can save you thousands when time is a factor.
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:34:30
Yes, you just need to keep it funded in advance. Basically if you need to fund investments don't wait to the last minute.

I will never be bored of those things.

Maybe you can send some money through PayPal to someone and they can send you the BTC.

I think the massive dump from NEO back to BTC had a lot to do with it

Wtf are you talking about? It’s obvious what he meant. He named the cat bitcoin because he bought it with $100 worth of bitcoin. Then put a 100 dollar bill in front of it.

Bitconnect coins are dependent to the success of bitcoin. Since it’s a lending platform that trades on the volatility of bitcoin they would naturally share the same trends.

I saw the title and didn’t need to read any further.
Did you hear what I said? 
My power company ran a underground service to my house for FREE, because they said they would make up the cost in electric bills. Which contradicts what’s happening in NY.
Ok. Now let’s think about this. Power doesn’t discriminate. KWh is a KWh.  What is NY doing with the additional revenue where they can’t reinvest it back into generation? 
Do you or the power company think mining or marijuana are going away? Sounds to me it’s a lack of preparation of customer growth. 
Instead of taking the additional revenue made off mining facilities to reinvest back into generation they are just passing the expense to the customers.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:37:43
Wait, the more power you use the more the power company makes.  Am I missing something? In the south they encourage you to use power. They ran a line to my house for free, because they said they would make up the cost in electric bills. I’m not sure what NY is doing, but they are doing it wrong.

File a claim with the Dept of Consumer Affairs in your state. PayPal generally favor the buyers in almost every case. Once your claim is filed, PayPal has a certain amount of time to refund you back your money. 
You can go around and around forever with PayPal on this otherwise.

Want to know a trick? You can actually open Gdax in safari and sign in and place it as a home screen icon. Once you do that it will be logged in every time you open it and see everything in real time. Try it! It seems to be very mobile friendly.

I sent a message to customer service and they replied back 30 days later. When you have 10s of thousands of dollars locked up in an account and virtually no customer service this creates a hell of a problem. If you don’t need customer service, everything runs smooth. But when you do, the CA Dept of Consumer Affairs have the ability to pull their business license if they don’t resolve customer complains in a timely manner.  It would be like a bank freezing your account for months on end. They need to figure out a better system, no doubt. If they get enough complaints they can be fined and ultimately lose their license.

I waited a month for Coinbase to finally respond a month later and tell me that only a specialist would be able to help me. I never heard back from them... So I created another account and opened another bank account and fixed my own problem. Most of coinbase is ran by automation. I found the best way to fix a problem is just start from scratch. 
There are many reasons why accounts get restricted. It would help if they will explain to customers why.

There's so many things in the world that needs at least iq of 100 to understand it, dont push yourself too much 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:34:15
From my personal experience, a specialist will email you back in about a month. After waiting an hour on the phone, you will only get a service rep that can’t do anything for you. I really don’t even know why they have them. Basically, no fucks are given at Coinbase.

An ETF will not get approved until BTC investments are insured.

Oh ya, I do. But I just don’t look at the price much anymore.

It’s bc it’s the assets are not insured.

This isn’t entirely accurate. China manufactures our goods for cheap labor. The US designs it.  One small example, when was the last time you bought a Chinese car?  They are  a cheap labor force. There population is 1.38 billion, without trade with the US they would starve to death.
