There has been alot of good news in the headlines about Bitcoin lately, including both the NASDAQ and USAA (two big US financial companies) looking at using Bitcoin Blockchain technology. Hopefully this results in higher Bitcoin prices, and therefore lower mining fees! Here's our latest news:
-We've added 24 hour rentals for Cloud Scrypt that have a 0% fee. Due to the vast increase in mining power and to better reflect current times, we are now denominating Scrypt as MHS instead of KHS.
-It's currently over, but make sure to follow us on social media since last week we gave away 1.0 BTC giveaway on Reddit - 0.01 BTC for first 100 people to post
Until next time...happy mining,
-The Eobot Team

Anytime you put money in or Bitcoin in,in this case and get back a percentage higher than the amount invested...that is investing~!
