Holy shit, the thumbnail it chose is my deity. **THE BITCOIN IS TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING**

JK, but the terror inspired by phrases like "2460 Mhash/s from one underwater machine" did shrink my junk just a little. I just meant that you all don't need some chump like me cross-posting links to subjects that are probably pretty old hat to you, such as worries about fluctuations in the hash total (that don't bear themselves out over time).

What precious little I know about statistics supports what you say. I'd liken it to the wildly inaccurate time estimates operating systems give you.
@_date: 2011-06-22 03:25:57
Agreed and done. Posted the link before realizing how that whole dealy worked, but I might have chuckled just a bit when I figured it out.

~~sexy-adoption~~ No, that's not right. Not at all.

Wow, they don't fuck around up in there. I'd crosspost this but I'm afraid some angry miner would use their 9000+ GPUs to cut a hole in space-time and send me back to the Mesozoic or some shit.

I think MBAM was just picking up a legit mining program heuristically in that instance, seeing it as a bitcoin *mining* trojan. I guess the requirements for a trojan that just steals wallets or provides access would be more general.

You know, or [it's this guy.](
@_date: 2011-06-22 05:46:59
Do you accept BitSlack?
@_date: 2011-06-22 03:10:20
You are probably right, but you can submit a false positive report with MBAM, just follow the instructions [here.]( MMMMMMMM, I loves me some MBAM.

With a wallet-stealing payload I'd venture?
