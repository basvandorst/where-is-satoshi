Government bonds are currency... it’s literally an iou from the government that prints the money. No they are not investments meant to outpace inflation, they are just meant to preserve your capital. So yes, but tbills, you won’t lose money. Hold cash, inflation will eat away at your buying power. But t-bills arent going to crash in value like corporate bonds or equities will. Or bitcoin.low risk low reward.
The internet was supposed to free the world! Guess what, just like everything else big business got its hands on it and took it over. You have no choice but to access the internet from the isp/wireless cartel. The richest corporations on earth track everything everyone does online, even your physical movements. The government taps in and listens to all of it, never has it been so easy for the government to keep track of everyone. 
The same will happen with bitcoin. It will never be what you people dream it will be, governments and Fortune 50 companies will figure out how to control it, manipulate it, and use to to their advantage, etc.. 
Cash ain’t going anywhere, and if something else does replace it, you can be damn sure the same people that control cash in todays world will be controlling whatever replaces it in the future.

Killing dogs is not legal, no one will know/care if you kill your own, but kill someone else’s dog with malicious intent and you could get jail time.

sorry i don't really give a shit, i didn't read your reply, i stopped when you tried to inform me that t-bills can't possible keep up with inflation.. you do know about TIPS right? you don't sound like you do, so not much point reading anything else you have to say. but yeah like i said, you do you, go all in on bitcoin i'm sure it will work out well
@_date: 2018-01-27 23:22:12
You got lucky. If your net worth is all in bitcoin you are taking a tremendous risk, it may pay off, you may end up broke. Honestly, no one knows, it’s a gamble.

Uhh no, if you buy t-bills your money isn’t going anywhere, if the usd goes to zero it means the end of the world is upon us and your bitcoin and every other currency on earth will have become worthless lonnnnnnng before. There is no reasonable realistic probable scenario where the Usd would experience hyperinflation. 
The odds of usd losing all its value in 100 years? 0.00000000000001%. Odds of bitcoin losing all its value in 10 years? 50%.
Don’t be obtuse

this will forever be the problem with bitcoin, i'm not a computer engineer but i'm definitely above average when it comes to computer knowledge, i've been building my own pc's for 20 years, i'm the guy that fixes computers in the family, the guy that was jailbreaking his apple tv, etc.. and bitcoin is simply complicated, that's really what's going to prevent the everyday joe from getting onboard.

haha yes my first modem was a 14.4, it might have even been a 9600, hard to remember. and was definitely downloading porn and doom on bbs's in my teens, i guess that was closer to 25 years ago. and yes ms-dos kings quest in the late 80's. i find wrapping my head around bitcoin/blockchain difficult and i'm not sure everyone that purports to understand it, actually does.

ah great thanks!

You can’t even fathom how good my life is, you’re some poor little idiot who has no idea how the world really works who has nothing and blames the government for taking what’s his. I see your type all the time, abject failures. Good luck with that, I truly don’t care but you should consider posting in @_date: 2018-02-06 03:41:50
But then everyone relies on wallets and coin base etc.. which all seem completely unreliable at this point.. so what is the point? 
A bank is a third parry holding and controlling your money. How is coinbase any different?

no it really isn't, these aren't stock options that aren't vested and can't be sold, or a ceo with 60% of the shares of the company who obviously wouldn't be able to sell without starting a firesale on their stock and obliterating the value of their shares after selling the first 10%, or an amount of money that would sway the market due to its size vs the liquidity of the market. 60K is a blip.
this logic that you buy 1000 shares of a company at $1 and it rockets to $1000 over a decade and then goes bankrupt over the next decade, "oh well you didn't lose anything, just imaginary money", no it wasn't imaginary, it was $1,000,000 in equity in a company that you failed to convert to a less volatile asset when there was no impediment to doing so, nothing more than a couple of clicks of a mouse. you owned it, it was yours, you lost one million dollars, full stop.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:20:43
Or when you don't cash out. It's like going to the casino with $100 and winning $1000, and then losing it all. You lost $1000, because you could have cashed out at any time. You didn't just lose $100. You had $1000 worth of chips in your hand. You owned them. They were yours. You chose to keep playing and lost them. Bitcoin or equities or real estate, there's no difference.

Are you 16 years old? Genuine question, my guess is possibly as young as 14.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:52:42
No that’s really not how it works. That’s what people with huge losses tell themselves
@_date: 2018-02-03 23:21:08
it sure beats sounding like a 14 year old
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:33:58
I dunno I’m 40 and haven’t worked in 12 years, I’m doing alright, good luck with your sales job kid
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:42:25
You just lost $40,000 in a month,  no matter how you rationalize it, you lost that amount. It was yours, just had to claim it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:32:37
yes you had it, you had an asset worth 1 million dollars. just like saying if you had a million dollars in gold bars and it got stolen "well you never really had a million dollars, it was just theoretical value"
if your house that you bought for $100,000 increased in value to a million dollars, and then burned down. you lost one million dollars, not $100,000. 
i can't do this, i feel like i'm talking to a groundhog, this is how stupid this is. fuck people are maddeningly stupid. i don't know why i bother i ultimately don't give a fuck what you think. if you want to be dumb be dumb. i'm out
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:44:38
i wouldn't waste my time arguing with you anymore than i would arguing with someone who thinks the moon landing was a hoax. there's literally no point, a basic level of intelligence is needed to play, you're disqualified by default.

You pay taxes because you can come home anytime and benefit from the safety and security if said country. So you pay in as long as you maintain that ability to just move back on a moments notice. If you don’t like it, renounce your citizenship, simple as that.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:18:53
I don’t understand, are you talking to yourself? Deflation = hoarding. It’s really that simple. Inflation = if you don’t invest you’re fucked. You want to grow an economy you need inflation, period. This is not open for debate.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:44:41
is there a wiki or something that breaks these all down and explains the pros/cons and risks and differences?
