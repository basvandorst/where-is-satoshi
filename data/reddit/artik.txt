thats my point. They claim and don't do anything else. By now some people started believing in them, including Google. The scientific community however hasn't.
Now who do you think knows more about the (quantum)matter, the science community trying (and succeding) to demonstrate quantum computing or a huge corporation that has too much money to spend on startups?
It's like comparing all the national space programs that have been run over many decades to a recently founded company that claims they can get you to the mars and back within the next year. Sounds legit, right?

it never has been anything but a big marketing thing. As someone who's involved in experimental quantumoptics i can tell you how much research is being done towards a quantum computer. Yes they do exist, but no, nowhere close enough to what would be needed for rsa decryption. And most definetly not in a commercial product that you can buy from a company in 2015.
That is not how fundamental research grade topics evolve. [This] ( approach seems nice, but i know that maaaaaany phd students will have alot of headaches trying to get it to run.

thats now how it works, especially if you want to compare by IQ. By definition an IQ of 100 is the average value of an underlying gaussian distribution, where one half is below 100.

you will always win when you compare to something that is worse by definition. So no point in doing it.
