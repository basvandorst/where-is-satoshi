thanks! I'll try it out later. no need for apologies, as far as I can see you're doing everyone a favor :D

I think the FAQ section has to be updated. Lots of numbers simply don't add up or seem to be leftovers from previous versions before the price change. I'm still not sure how everything works since the FAQ seems so messed up.
also, the free games don't seem to make much sense. If there's a ~14% chance for every 0.01 BTC game to win a free game, but you have to bet at least 0.10 BTC to actually redeem a free game "voucher", your free game counter will stack up in the long run with no way to use them all up.

you are correct, this didn't work for me at first so I discarded it. Added!

I'm not an expert on this (probably somebody else reading here is), but underclocking shouldn't do any damage to your device (or have really small chances to compared to overclocking), since you're not toasting it.
When I played around with mine I simply tried to lower and lower and lower it until I found the deepest spot at which my system wouldn't freeze. 
Lots of rebooting involved, so you can check for yourself if the temperature/loudness/electricity improvements are worth it. 
I think afterburner automatically works around the manufacturers underclocking limitations, I have no experience under linux but the number one google result was

I have a mobile 6770, but mining on a laptop is never a good idea. However, I played around with it for a day or so! I think the desktop variant doesn't use much more than 100 Watts, what's the MHash/s you're seeing? I think it shouldn't be that inefficient. It says average US electricity cost is 0.12$/kwh, that would be much better than Germany, IF you're from the US and not in the more expensive areas. :D
You can try to download MSI afterburner and UNDERclock the memory since it's not really needed. Just make sure you don't set afterburner to automatically apply your settings on system startup, so that when you underclock it too far your system will simply reboot (hopefully!). If it worked well on the mobile version, it should do on the desktop! But your probably already did that anyway :D

boring is good right now, I would say :D

thanks! wow, there's a tipping fee of 20%? those evil geniuses.
I think you should try to get your Memory clock down to 1/3 of the original. The mobile 6770 can only do around 100 MHash/s. What mining program and pool are you using? It's been a while since I've done it.
I was a lazy windows bum using guiminer with -v -w128 and I really liked Eclipse Mining for all the graphs and free options (f.e. sms and e-mail notification when your miner stops).

I also found this: 
Since I still play these games it comes in useful.

This could also finally solve the fuckery with games costing the same amount of EUR / USD / Aussie dollars etc.

hmmm, I followed the instructions on Heroku, created a Procfile:
web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT
and did all steps using GitHub, created an app, deployed/pushed your data without Error messages, but it's still not working:

very few people I have talked to know that linux is an operating system, and what an operating system is, and that windows and iOs are operating systems too, and what iOs is. Windows and Apple/Mac work fine by now.

how much does running the faucet cost you a day?
I mean, can the ads compensate for some of it, or is it basically almost 100% charity?

9369 - September 27th - Jalapeno
You could upgrade your Jalapeno Order to a mini without changing your number in line? Still sounds risky, if they seriously never deliver they could just run away with the money and PayPal couldn't help, right? 
Also, if they deliver in 2014 it would also be close to useless. :(

I guess the pitfall here is the incentive from 1 correct guess:
Ticket Back + Free Play!*
for a 0.01 BTC ticket, that sounds like a 14,57% chance to get back 0.02 BTC.
You will be able to use only one free play for each 0.10 BTC you bet on your next ticket. Some of your free plays will expire if not use within the next 500 Blocks.

oh! what should it be named or what tables should it contain? where should I have found that info? thanks for the quick reply.
/edit/ or do you just mean that I have to type in:
heroku addons:add cleardb:ignite
it wants me to insert billing information although it says $0. :(
