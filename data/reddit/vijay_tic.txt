Cuba were the most resilient.. Hence the Heroics of Che and Castro who are regarded high in the communist world. Every country can't replicate Cuba.

Who is US to do all these???? What US did to Iraq is still unbelievable.. Demolishing the entire country killing thousands of innocent people.. Even sadam would have been better.. If Maduro is a dictator let Venezuelans fight it out.. Not the US.. Let US stop being the Moral Police of the world..

Same applies to you! So how do u justify sanctions on a suffering country!! Curious to know what bothers US so much about Venezuela!! 
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:10:12
Both US and Russia can stop poking their noses!!  Opposing US doesn't mean I support Russia lol!!
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:07:31
Does the mainstream media ever tell you that US imposed sanctions caused the Venezuela economic crisis? Does the US and it's allies have the right to freeze the funds of Venezuela and make a country starve? Just research and act prudent. Don't use a country's economic plight for mere shilling!!

Aid from US? Lol!! Mainstream media propaganda to make Madero an evil and thus justify all the US actions!! US is the only savior who can impose Sanctions and provide aid too. Even red cross distanced itself from facilitating that aid from US. DYOR. 
U blame socialism for the economic collapse and not the targeted sanctions by US on Venezuelan economy is commendable. Capitalists take so much of strain to see that communism and socialism doesn't succeed in any country.
@_date: 2019-03-12 09:18:29
But who is US to do that? Why is UN in place? why has Bank of England freezed almost $1 billion worth of Venezuela's gold when it's people are starving? Sanctions on a country that's suffering.. US need not do the moral policing throughout the world. Already the world has seen the what US did to Iraq blaming them of weapons of mass destruction which US is still searching for. UN and other world nations are turning a blind eye as US bends and breaks the international laws!!! 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:49:44
Greatest irony is "Does US obey international law?" 
@_date: 2019-03-12 16:14:11
Even there are speculations on Trump winning the election, so let China declare Hillary as US president!! Isn't this a mockery of a country's judicial system and sovereignty?? US Intervention in all the internal affairs of a country is ominous!! World wouldn't  forget what US did to the people of Afghanistan Iraq Syria Venezuela Cuba and the list goes on!! Just none is in a position to speak up against US is pathetic!!

Unocoin exchange is providing this facility for its customers so that withdrawal of fiat is easier considering no banks support Crypto transactions (as per RBI's instruction). India is the perfect platform - crypto vs central bank :)

There are also sources Iraq was against USD.
US comes up with some rationale to invade any other country. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:44:37
Ohh.. Any way to increase the fees
@_date: 2019-04-22 05:03:18
Sorry for your losses!! 
Though not for Oil, US wants to stamp it's authority over the entire world. US is the only country to wage war against countries that it doesn't share borders with. It's total authoritarian behavior. And it really surprises me why Americans as such are so quiet about these war crimes!! Of course any action by US is termed as "On nations interest".

But we can send it to our original address right
@_date: 2019-04-20 07:07:13
Doesn't matter for US. It can wage war on Iraq, Afghanistan and get oil. Force countries to trade only in USD. Can impose Sanctions. Can wage economic wars against countries that doesnt ally with them. All these require huge arms strength!! Debt doesn't impact US!!

Someone replied like he has been waiting since 29 March!! That's why wondering 
@_date: 2019-04-28 02:17:56
So is it possible to generate a Non-RBF transaction (so that RBF is not possible at all) from a wallet? If so, how can we identity if a transaction can be replaced by a higher fee or not?
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:54:42
What I am trying to understand is "Can a merchant accept bitcoin once the transaction is broadcasted but with zero confirmation?" 
If he does accept the above scenario, the customer has the opportunity to replace the txn with a higher fee and return it to his address right? In which case customer walks away with the goods for free!!!

Oil rich nations are forced to trade in USD (which keeps up the demand value of USD). Iraq was one of them which opposed to trade against USD.   Afghanistan has huge reserves of natural gas as per US geological survey. 
So the point is, US government can keep up the USD value (by means of its force) so it can sail through its debt.  And US is not the largest exporter but stands at 7th.

I believe there must be some mechanism to push the txns held up for long time into next blocks..
