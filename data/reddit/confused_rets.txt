Yeah, I've been trying to tell myself that I will finally buy in when it stabilizes, but every time I am about to buy, stuff like this happens and I get nervous all over again.

I think there is still a lot you can do with this. I mean, a chart is fine and all but you are kind of losing a lot of the power that excel innately has in it. I am currently working on a (currently) linux shell script that takes the index.html page of the mtgox website and strips the current prices and stores the data and a file every 10 seconds. I think that maybe what you should do is make the chart back-end and have sort of a UI for the first page where the user can input the price they bought, possibly have multiple fields, average the costs and output what the break even point would be given the prices they purchased their bitcoin. This would make it so you don't need the chart anyway, but if you really like it you could just move it to another page and tittle the page "Break Even Chart."
I hope this helps, I wasn't really sure if you were looking for advice. I made a similar Excel sheet before I was taking programming classes to calculate if selling gems on the Auction House was profitable in Diablo 3.

It was my assumption that anyone that liked bitcoins would probably prefer Adam Smith's philosophy.

Yeah, I found that a couple of days ago after I had just finished the script. I started looking at it yesterday and it looks like most of my old code will be useless so I'll try out python, I hear it works pretty well with scraping information.
