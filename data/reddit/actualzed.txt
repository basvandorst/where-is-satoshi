I second lightlasertower, once you're through the technical parts chances are most of your questions you will answer yourself...


Nothing special, miners' income increasingly come from transaction fees up until there is nothing left to mine at which point mining relies solely on transaction fees. Otherwise the coins are infinitely divisible, so instead of printing new money to support adoption, we dig our way into decimals, but one coin remains one coin, so it's massively expected to just grow in value over time, at least for as long as the network is safe and sound and adoption continues. So there is no bubble, or rather, only temporary bubbles against fiat that are exciting now but that will look like tiny hiccups once we're in the millions/btc (if fiat is still not dead by then, if it is we're talking about a virtual value of billions/btc)... To quote a redditor a long time ago:


Surely your dad will appreciate this wise comparison, imagine you lived back then and somehow got your hands on a goldmine (bitcoins) for the price of a donkey (usd), right before gold became a widely accepted form of payment... Well that's what you would be doing here but that's also where the catch is, it has to become a widely accepted form of payment for the moon to be reached, that's where your risk is going to be, if gold does not become widely accepted, then there is more value in the donkey.

can you make a generic version that accepts keywords? that allows changing the order and colors? min and max font size? min max panel width/height? hide-able bottom panel? that does not cut words in half?
