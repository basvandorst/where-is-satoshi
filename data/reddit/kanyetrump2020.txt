Half Jewish, but thank you for showing your colours. ��
And the lenders in the temple were most certainly Jews, as are the heads of most banks. So are around half of all billionaires in the US.

He probably knew the same thing a lot of us did, the price was skyrocketing while volume was dropping day after day. If you didn’t get out, you weren’t paying attention.

Fiat currencies do the same thing, they just doesn’t fluctuate rapidly on the local level, because consumer goods are priced in the currency your using. If adoption expands to the point of surpassing fiat, you’ll see the same localized price stability, because items will be priced in btc.

Why are prices for bitcoin so high? What stops people from just using an online exchange? Is access to the internet so limited that it’s bottlenecking supply?

Hmmm, fair point. I was thinking of moving btc over and exchanging for a stable coin at cost, which I could then move back and repeat, but that’s likely not possible.
Any reliable way of sending donations to actual people, and not just organizations?

Are there local exchanges I could sell crypto at cost to help lower the price?
@_date: 2019-01-27 04:30:32
Yeah, luck. Weird how everyone sold, which is why the price dropped. Price was skyrocketing while volume was plummeting day after day. If you didn’t sell, you weren’t paying attention.

So then, what benefit does it offer the average consumer?
The potential is there, but it’s still being developed. 
Edit: Downvoting without an answer just acknowledges that I’m right. It’s an easy question. Why should the average consumer prefer BTC at this time? There’s either a benefit, or theirs not. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:36:44
Because you have no way of knowing if the market will recover. The current trend is downwards, which spurs on selling, which then dives the price lower and lower until it hits 0 or something happens to restore investor confidence.
Bear markets can last years, and take even longer to recover. The price isn’t going to shoot to 20,000 tomorrow. It will likely keep losing a few percentage points at a time though.
@_date: 2018-12-17 09:44:34
In a bear market, you’re just losing value every week if you do that. There’s no reason to buy into a consistently declining market when recovery takes longer than a crash.

I doubt if most people could even explain broadly how their microwave works, but they can certainly make popcorn. They don’t need to know how something works in order to use it. 
If blockchain tech is to last, it will be as a platform for other projects that are useful and intuitive to use.

Holding is not an investment strategy. It’s pure FOMO.

And that won’t happen until it is something more than a speculative asset/way to buy drugs online.

It’s hard to knock the system that led to the explosion of development we’ve seen over the past century.

I am telling it to you. One of the worrying things about btc investors is that most of you have no real experience investing, so you’re highly prone to common errors like viewing an eventual upswing as inevitable. I think we’ll see one, but it’s not a guarantee, and btc is not a market. It’s a single asset, that not only could eventually fail, but absolutely will. It’s just a matter of when.
You don’t invest in a crashing market. You invest when it levels out, and shows signs of recovery. It’s leveling out now because people are uncertain about the future, but we’re not seeing recovery yet. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:00:43
Oof, that sucks. Volatility is one of the biggest challenges in terms of using it as a currency.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:31:23
That’s because it’s not a currency unless you’re trying to buy drugs online for the most part. It offers no real benefit to the average consumer, and has quite a few drawbacks.
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:55:30
That’s a terrible investment strategy.

@_date: 2018-12-17 08:00:58
Too much info for one post, but setting up a consistent conservative I stop loss to sell a losing position is the first and most important thing to learn. Holding and buying into a bear market that isn’t showing signs of recovery is just fear of missed opportunity.

Past performance is not an indicator of future outcomes*
You essentially have a lot of people that got lucky on an investment, and now think they understand the complexity of markets. It’s important imo to understand that BTC is not a diverse market, it’s a single asset, that not only can fail, but absolutely will eventually. There is absolutely no benefit to holding through a long term downward trend. You should not ever be investing in anything without first having a strategy that includes reasoned projections, and an entry and exit point. 
That said, I picked up 5% today, and typically average a 1 - 2% gain weekly, so I’m not too pessimistic, I just hate seeing people throw money away on inapplicable investment aphorisms that they don’t understand. It’s really sad, because crypto in general is a great tool for learning how to invest wisely due to the low barrier to entry. You can put 100$ on any exchange and apply whatever investment strategy your learning, as you sharpen your analytics. If you’re using a 1 - 2 % stoploss, it’ll last you quite a while even if you lose every position, and in that time you’ll gain real understanding if you’re studying and applying a consistent back tested strategy.

I’m not a fan of trading on margin, so I’ve never looked into it for bitcoin. Are there any markets that off such a thing, because that’s essentially what it is?
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:10:40
Holy shit, look at BCH! Crypto in general is up the past few days, but they’re up over 50 percent.

If it stays steady for a while and we see market recovery, I’ll consider investing at 4K if other factors line up. I sell at any drop of more than 1%.
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:50:43
This isn’t a market like the stock exchange or forex where things can be shifted around over time to hedge against loss. There’s no guarantee that a particular crypto will last, and we don’t have tangible assets to assess valuation. It’s pure trade for the sake of outwitting other traders. BTC investing is more akin to gambling at this stage.
