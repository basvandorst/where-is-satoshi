So it sort of automatically keeps the ledger updated?

Literally none of this is addressing the issue with Bitcoin that I'm presenting. You're talking down the existing system. Bitcoin has the opposite issue, where a limited money supply means (to borrow your analogy) that although the pie can be infinitely divided, there is never any additional pie. This is a huge issue! If I own 1% of all Bitcoins then even if every Bitcoin is divided into a trillion pieces, assuming I don't dispose of my coins, I still own 1% of all Bitcoins. I can just sit on this 1% while the rest of the world has to rely on the remaining 99%. As the economy grows, each Bitcoin is worth more and more.
According to [this]( about one million people collectively already own 50% of all Bitcoins that will ever exist. If they never sell then the remaining 99.986% of the world's population has to get paid and transact with the remaining 50%. How is this a good thing?
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:14:30
That's not the issue that I'm asking about though.
The issue with Bitcoin is that a massive concentration of Bitcoins is possible. And unlike fiat, Bitcoin is a zero sum game. Every Bitcoin that someone else holds is one that I can't. How is this a good thing?
@_date: 2014-12-09 16:14:24
But isn't that obvious trolling? People here seem to believe that there are sinister sophisticated forces working to bring down Bitcoin. Only posting buy or hodl and especially posting in Buttcoin is a surefire way of discrediting yourself if your goal is to actually to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt.
Accounts that exist for only two minutes and/or have only posted in bitcoin/buttcoin are also obvious rookie moves. Reddit loves proving someone is a shill. It is much much harder to prove someone is a shill if they are subtle. An account that occasionally posts to other subs and has consistently posted normal comments/posts for example. Sounds familiar? I'm describing the vast majority of Reddit accounts. 
Yet if you were getting paid, it would be fairly simple to have a bunch of different accounts that you rotate, posting articles and news critical of Bitcoin. How do you detect this?

So what is the advantage of Bitcoin over Litecoin?
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:03:19


One of the main selling points of Bitcoin is that it is a decentralised currency. Why is this a good thing?
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:39:41
Being serious: I don't think you should joke about this stuff with this guy. He seems unstable and delusional, like Bitcoin is his big ticket to payday. Look at all the subs he moderates, he's deep into cryptocurrencies with no exit strategy.
He's clearly taking your comment seriously (going through your history, it's obvious you're trolling him) and eventually he's going to go off the deep end. He's pretty much up to his neck already so the last thing he needs is a push.

I don't really understand how that is different from a bank transfer. Is it because there is no bank account? You store your bitcoin somewhere else?


But if you're only putting 2% away (assuming equal transactions) then won't you have to go through 50 transactions to cover the cost of a single scam? I feel like the 2-3% fee is worth it in comparison for the "insurance" it provides.


That's not an issue with credit card companies though. It's like saying no bank vault is safe because at least one person always has the ability to open it. Besides isn't the Mt Gox fiasco a strong counter to this argument?


Is this how it works? Just because they have your credit card data doesn't mean they have the authorisation to pull your funds out.


See you're saying security without trust, but all I see is security without oversight. As you said before, it only takes one person. I see a third party, especially some form of government watchdog, necessary to prevent illicit trading.
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:19:35
I want your answer. Surely you can summarise?
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:49:53
How so?
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:25:45


I'm saying it's a bad thing because early adopters have already concentrated enough wealth to essentially run the planet, should Bitcoin become the sole currency of the world. Individual people will own enough wealth to purchase entire nations. That level of individual power has historically been shown to be a bad thing leading to revolutions etc. Not to mention the amount of death and suffering an incompetent leader would create.
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:04:11
Okay sure.
What about the rest of my post?
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:39:04


Yes they are divisible but one Bitcoin is still one Bitcoin.
If you hold one Bitcoin and divide it into a million pieces, the total of those pieces is still one Bitcoin.
There are only 21 million or so Bitcoins (or there abouts) so lets say 21 million people each hold one Bitcoin. It doesn't matter how divisible they are because unless you are taking Bitcoin from someone else, you aren't creating new Bitcoin by dividing existing Bitcoin.


This is not the traditional sense of wealth inequality that we're used to in the media. This is systemic and cannot be mitigated. Bill Gates' wealth won't stop me from creating a billion dollar empire. If everyone only has 21 million Bitcoins to play with, I cannot create wealth, I can only increase the value of existing Bitcoins meaning unless I hold Bitcoins prior to creating a successful business, I'm only making it harder to acquire additional Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:24:29
So Bitcoin has no inherent advantage over other cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2014-12-08 09:59:37
Sure but in the meantime, companies do still need to pay rent, utility bills and staff.
To get off the ground you need money and people often get a loan from a bank. Hence why people are talking about banks. Because if banks won't lend to Bitcoin companies, that's a serious hindrance to start-ups. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:32:30


Can you tell me why it is bullcrap? 
Also can you tell me who Mike Maloney is?
You've also already linked me the bank of England document as well.
What point are you trying to make with it? Taking an intro to macroeconomics course will tell you that inflation exists so that the central bank can influence the economy to prevent or minimise harm from recession. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:45:00


What is the point of the video?


So? What point are you trying to make? 
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:26:59
Okay let me ask you another question then:
What is wrong with the fractional reserve system aside from inflation which is a necessary side affect to allow banks to minimise the effects of recessions?
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:50:34
Which are also exactly what banks are: they match up those in need of capital with those with excess capital willing to lend. 
So what is the advantage of an exchange over a currently existing financial intermediary?
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:22:03
How can you tell the difference between legitimate criticism and trolling? 
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:18:49
You've already linked me this video in this thread.
It reads like a video designed to sucker people in by oversimplifying very complicated processes and make it seem like you're getting screwed then turns around to provide you a solution that the guy making the video sells. I watched the first two minutes of the video then I looked up Mike Maloney. Can you provide any credentials or anything? I can't find any information on the guy other than the fact that he's eager to sell you gold. I'm also willing to bet that somewhere in the video, he tells you that gold is the solution to all your problems because it's "real" and not affected by inflation or something like that. So he can sell you some.
Here read this and then come back to talk
 
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:27:37


They move their assets into low volatility assets such as gold and bonds (fixed income) but not real estate (too risky). Bitcoin is not something you would move your assets to if their is excessive market volatility. 


But counterparty risk is just one of the many forms of risk (and a fairly minor one). Being a currency and a commodity it is subject both to currency risk and market risk, two far more important risk types. 


Why would you want to preserve your wealth in digital currency though? If you truly want to preserve your wealth, keep it in cash which is only subject to inflation and currency risk (which if you're not making international transactions is negligable).
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:48:51


Can you tell me why they even print more money in the first place if this is such an issue?
@_date: 2014-10-02 07:05:27


I think what he is saying is that if someone steals money from you online, you have the ability to negotiate the loss with a bank/insurer. I don't really know enough about bitcoin to say how it's different but presumably the anonimity makes it really hard to trace.
@_date: 2014-12-08 06:35:10
You're not really providing any solutions, though.

@_date: 2015-02-08 06:03:15
This reads like something out of &gt;A lot of people, everywhere, have very jaded and misinformed opinions about a lot of things. . . especially things based largely on logic and which produce paradoxical outcomes.
You haven't actually corrected any of the so-called "misinformed opinions" that are supposedly so prevalent. 


Why are you talking about Austrian economics? What relevance does it have to the original complaint that people are misinformed about Bitcoin?


Can I get a source for this? 


Isn't the whole epistemological issue about whether inductive reasoning can be used to gain knowledge? I don't know why anyone would say it's the only way to gain knowledge when deductive reasoning exists but it's not unreasonable to believe that inductive reasoning can be used to gain knowledge, depending on your definition of knowledge.  


What are you even saying here?


There's an organised anti-Bitcoin movement? doesn't count.


It is absolutely understandable and sensible to be wary about things that you don't understand or are unfamiliar to you. It is not sensible to throw caution to the wind and jump head first into the unfamiliar. The most hate I see in is not directed towards Bitcoin itself but rather to the people who attempt to participate in the world of Bitcoin but who don't understand what they're getting themselves into then complain when they've lost all their money, either through a scam or a decline in value. It's either heart breaking (if the person was well-meaning but naive) or just depressing (delusional or attempting to hide a gambling addiction).


What about those who understand the technical side of Bitcoin and are still wary? Bill Gates during his AMA said that the price of Bitcoin fluctuates too much to be useful to impoverished people and the inability to force transaction reversal due to anonymity is bad if you make a mistake. These seem like reasonable things to be concerned about.
@_date: 2015-10-17 10:37:23


At the same time though, someone could theoretically amass their bitcoin fortune and never have a family to leave it to. No one can force them to give up their keys prior to death. 
Not to mention accidental death resulting in the losses of a few bitcoins here and there over time. 


The gold doesn't disappear though. The supply of gold remains unaffected.
Or rob an armored car?
To steal what? Cash?


Again, your argument depends on what is being taken. 


You can think of banks as a way to store your cash and prevent theft. Will there be Bitcoin banks for people who don't want to individually manage their holdings?
@_date: 2015-02-19 04:46:55
I've been following your argument and I believe that you are indeed the one who is correct. The person you're arguing against is having trouble discerning government intervention in the market (regulation, tariffs etc.) that adds restrictions to the ability to buy and sell within that market  (no longer making it a free market) from government participation in the market (selling Bitcoin that was forfeited) which does not affect how free the market is. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:08:57


I absolutely can since I was referring to you. I was accusing the person of making baseless assertions and you try and discredit me by claiming that I do the same. How is that not an appeal to hypocrisy?
Also as a side not the wikipedia article you linked has the phrase "the pot calling the kettle black" in the "see also" section which is the exact phrase you said to me. Make of this what you will. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:09:39
And those changetips are worth more the less bitcoins there are.

Eh, I was taking the contrary opinion on one of Reddit's favourite topics to bash. It's what I expected. I will also freely admit that I tried to research how internet was rolled out in the US but it's surprisingly elusive. (I'm talking about who paid for the infrastructure) Feel free to link me some figures if you can find any because I couldn't and I'm still interested.


That's true. I guess you could say that I was questioning his opinions then.
