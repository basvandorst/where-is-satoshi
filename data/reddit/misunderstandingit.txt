Dude fuck they and them and the whole thing. I know how long the game is. I buy when I can and offer it to friends and family instead of cash. Oh you bought the pizza, let me pay you back in Bitcoin I don't have cash on me. Oh what's Bitcoin? Well... 
We're all in this together folks.

Bitcoin is a is a big list of transactions that everyone shares. With Bitcoin, we are all The Bank. It is the most immutable, decentralized, cryptographic currency on the planet, but you don't have to know what those last words mean. They're cool words and you should learn more about Bitcoin, but all you REALLY need to know is that, at the end of the day, Bitcoin is little numbers that live on the internet. You can use QR codes or other methods to send these little numbers to someone else whenever you want. And for some magical reason we have all decided that those little numbers are worth A LOT, and if you ask me, they are going to be worth A LOT more.

Either go watch all of Idiocracy right now or go watch the Wisecrack break down. It's just sooooooo good and horrifyingly accurate with today's political climate. It's worth your time.

Humans will always be corruptible. Math though. I don't think you can convince math of ANYTHING dawg.

Dude I am so sad about my life and feel so useless I would have stood up, as soon as they began their threats, and said "I want you to hit me. No. I want you to beat me senseless. Pound my head with your fists until I am nothing but a bloody mess then make sure you finish the job." They would have done one of 2 things. Actually beat the shit out of me, or try to get the money and run. No matter what they choose I would be screaming "End my life! END MY LIFE!" Until I had no more breath to scream it. Yeah you handled this a lot better than I would have.

I'm sooooo hype about the price. I was worried I would never quite get to one full coin. This dip is making it doable!

Shit dawg I've been thinking more like 2040.

Hey this is super cool, how does this tiping thing work? It's not like this bot can get into my impenetrable vault... Right?

Sweet dude thanks!

I literally only keep about a "2 months worth of bills" cash pillow in USD. Every single dollar I "save" goes right into BTC. I don't care what the price is as I don't really plan on using it until the entire Global Debt Based Economy collapses.

I'll be darned, a gentleman AND a scholar. Thanks I'll definitely be giving a little away myself!
