Not even worth it to send that little amount unless you have it on Gdax where they pay the fee.

You have to disable Authenticator on your coinbase account, then install Authenticator on your new phone, then re enable Authenticator on your coinbase account. If you don’t, you will probably be locked out of your account for good. Do not forget to do this.

Try as many as you can afford. Bitcoin, Etherium, Litecoin, Ripple, and Siacoin are great options!

Lots of us joined the hype back in 2017 when it went from 18k to 20k in a matter of minutes. Then just earlier this year it plummeted all the way down to 3k. Still, believe in the technology and hold out for the long run. Maybe try reading the threads where very early bitcoiners sold there coins when the price hit a dollar. Now look where they’d be. Unless you absolutely need the money why not just hang on and see where it goes? It’s a rollercoaster for sure but that’s half the fun!

It will go back up man, you got in now (very good) you just hang on and watch. I predict that it’ll be at probably over $30,000 by the end of next year. Don’t be scared! We’re all in this together!

In for the “giving away BTC” hook us up brotha
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:36:40
Giving away BTC?? You now have my attention 
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:55:03
You only bought a fraction of bitcoin, so you only get a fraction of the $6,000 price. Seems right to me
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:25:02
I'm pretty dumb, can you give me steps on how do to this...
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:43:23
So to make sure I have this right..
1. Disable authenticator on Coinbase
2. Download authenticator on new phone
3. Re enable authenticator on Coinbase
4. "Set it up" on new phone?
Do I delete it off of my old phone. Am I missing anything?

Google Authenticator

No I'm asking whether or not it would be safe to BUY BITCOIN RIGHT NOW. And not move it at all. I would not be able to move my coin to another private wallet anyways because the transaction would have only been initiated and I would not be able to see Bitcoin on my dashboard as been received yet because the process from purchase to actually receiving the coin is like a week. Would it be safe to purchase right now and do nothing else, just let it sit

I'm trying to not lose coins due to the fork. I just need to know whether the fork will cause me to potentially lose my coins if I were to buy some right now
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:51:22
Thank youuuu. That's the answer I've been looking for
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:06:16
I know that it doesn't, but since I technically wouldn't have any coins on the site is it ok to buy from them right now and by the time I physically receive the coins in my wallet the storm will be over. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:12:28
Honestly I'm not really concerned with the BCC I'd get at all. Plus I wouldn't be verified with Kraken this soon. I just want to know if I'd technically be safe buying Bitcoin right now to get in the game in case the price shoots up. It wouldn't "arrive" in my wallet before the 1st, so does that mean I'm good to buy it since I don't have any existing coin?
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:17:03
It's ok to buy coin now without having to worry about losing it after the fork? I don't have any coin currently to move so I should be ok right?
