They jusy won't do it. You can stop thinking about it.
@_date: 2014-05-21 21:12:16
They're removing wallets and apps that involve transactions. Bitcoin doesn't fit with their IAP policies.
But there's a lot of Bitcoin apps in the App Store that don't involve Bitcoin transactions. Did you even search?
@_date: 2014-03-11 21:15:25
No. Absolutely false. Only wallets.
@_date: 2014-03-12 11:52:47
Fair point.
I should have said: apps that involve Bitcoin payments
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:52:18
Just read it again.
Other than those Bitcoin wallets, do you have any other examples?
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:58:17
*removed bitcoin wallets
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:29:25
That's not Apple's style at all
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:37:44
Yup! But the thing that actually enables Siri to give the value of Bitcoins is Wolfram Alpha. But maybe now that Bing supports it Siri will get data from Bing
@_date: 2014-05-21 21:16:08
There's only one character that's different.
You're using Apple website search engine. It's not meant to search the web at all, why would they care about Google top search queries? Hey, Paris Hilton is a top search query.
I'm pretty certain it's not voluntary.
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:53:01
Yes :)
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:46:53
"for no other reason than to ban a potential competitor in the online payment market"
Are you dumb? Did you even read about the matter on places other than ?
The true reason was that it wasn't really compatible with their 30% IAP policy. But they finally realized their rules didn't work and allowed wallets.
Google has the same 30% IAP policy, FYI...
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:41:15
Damn. I thought I possibly had an advantage here.
@_date: 2014-06-16 11:46:44
"It's still Apple"
So what do you want them to do?
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:33:14
No it doesn't work that way. You didn't get it
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:18:04
You should see what Apple unveiled during the last Keynote. It's not exactly the same as before and they did stuff they never would have done with Steve Jobs still in command, and that's a good thing imo (that they're evolving and not standing still).
Also, I'm not going to change my cellphone for a Bitcoin wallet (that's available on both platforms). I'm quite comfortable in the "walled garden". I can use my phone to do whatever I want.
Tell me a concrete example of something I want to do but can't because I'm in a "walled garden". Please.
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:23:06
What do you mean by "rumors"? It's confirmed. It's in their rules.
I called them and they said they theoretically would accept a Bitcoin wallet but they'd need to have a look at it first (of course)
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:44:02

I'm not jailbroken and I do have a torrent app (transmission). Never used (when would I need it?!?)
As other people said, iOS 8 will implement third-party keyboards and extensions. Google that.
But still, my phone was great with iOS 7. Everything worked well.
And yeah with iOS 8 your mail thing is solved.
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:14:08
Add the website to the home screen? Doesn't that sort of solve your problem?
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:56:26
Not really. What you described is something that sort of bypasses their IAP policies.
There are tons of Bitcoin apps on the App Store. They really don,t give a fuck as long as there's no money transactions involved and yes I agree that they need to figure this shit out.
But I sent them a Bitcoin app and they refused it because they wanted me to explain users how to create a Bitcoin address. I'm not kidding.

@_date: 2014-03-12 11:53:07
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:36:29
Okay, so you can't claim they removed everything.
A lot of Bitcoin apps popped up since then.
@_date: 2014-05-07 12:11:19
Hey we KNOW why they got banned. Bitcoin wallets do not comply with their IAP policies where they should get 30% for anything that isn't a donation (I think there are a few other exceptions).
I don't think Apple really has anything against Bitcoin. I personally think they couldn't care less about Bitcoin but you guys on are insane and seem to think Apple wants to destroy Bitcoin and took it as a personal attack...
Yes, they should adapt their rules to be able to deal with Bitcoin Wallets. No they never banned Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-10 21:18:40
It works with Siri
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:41:58
yeah my phone is basically only useful because of a bitcoin wallet that i use literally 100% of the time
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:27:53
Developers have an NDA, fyi, so we might not get all the information.


Source? Not sure that ever happened.


I don't think it's more cringeworthy than people smashing a few iPhones and filming it, feeling like they're changing the world and that Tim Cook is concerned about it.
All I'm saying is that "for no other reason than to ban a potential competitor in the online payment market" is absolutely false.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:26:50
Okay, whatever man
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:28:47
Yeah, to each their own preferred platform.
And yeah, SD cards and high capacity batteries are legit concerns about iPhones specifically, but I was talking about the OS, more specifically. But anyway, the latest Nexus devices don't include either... (It's hard to find a perfect Android device, imo)
But, yeah, check out the new features in iOS 8. Sure, you can't change the default apps but apps can interact with each other in ways they never could before... (Even on Android, in some cases)
@_date: 2014-05-21 12:05:00
That's a search engine suggestion error. You're really going to take that as Apple's position?!
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:41:25
Well, unless you have an enterprise thing or you're a dev, yeah.
But what apps do you want that aren't on the App Store?
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:40:18
Takes about 5 days on average.
Seriously, just give me one example, that's all I want
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:30:50
Yeah that was before the Macintosh. Apple ads weren't particularly beautiful back then.
@_date: 2014-06-17 02:52:57
Well, in that app's case, even Google removed it from the Play Store...
And yes, I can understand why the concept affects you, but personally, I've never been affected by any of that stuff and I see it more as quality control.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:43:32


So, if you didn't switch you'd still be happy.
Anyway I just hope you weren't dumb enough to smash your old phone and that you sold it.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:28:17
They actually wanted me to show people how to create a Bitcoin wallet. I'm not kidding.
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:53:48
Okay but once Bitcoin adoption starts taking off... what will differentiate Google from Apple?
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:49:47
They didn't give much info, but when you read the App Store guidelines you can clearly see where Bitcoin interferes and it's in the IAP section.
They didn't ban all Bitcoin apps and personally I think they couldn't care less about Bitcoin. I submitted a Bitcoin QR scanner to them and they suggested I instruct users on how to create a Bitcoin wallet. I am not making this up.
Also, yeah, they may be working on a payment mechanism that may work with the next iPhone or iOS 9 or whatever, but I don't think that's the reason.
Oh, and 50 people smashing their iPhones won't affect their sales at all. And almost nobody knows what Bitcoin is...
Yeah well I'm not saying Apple did a good job by banning Bitcoin wallets, but I am 99% certain it had to do with their 30% IAP policy and they didn't know how to deal with virtual currencies correctly.
Google isn't as strict with their Play Store rules, except when it comes to ad blocking.
@_date: 2014-02-06 16:30:24
It came out in 1997 IIRC, back when Steve Jobs just came back to Apple and Apple was definitely an underdog doing things differently for creative people, like releasing an all-in-one computer with colors without a floppy drive (omg how dare they), a colored laptop with Wi-Fi or a desktop computer so powerful it was actually classified as a weapon by the U.S Defense Department so they didn't have the right to sell it to some countries.
Anyway, the ad did have its place back then. I still think it would sort of work today, but not as much as back then.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:18:47
Nope. It doesn't work that way
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:42:17
Those videos got about 100k views and a lot of them came from And we're on Reddit, so maybe 50k iOS users saw those videos? Half of them were laughing about it. Half of the rest didn't care (me included). Really, the impact is much smaller than you think it is. Oh, and if those iPhones don't get on craigslist well it makes used iPhones a bit more rare and increases the value of used iPhones and encourages people to buy a new one. Though that effect is probably even smaller than the small impact of those videos. I'd say at most 10k people decided they would stop buying Apple products after that.
And yeah, their blocking was irrational, but a wallet does imply that some currency is moving in and out of the phone. If they really wanted to ban Bitcoin they would have banned all Bitcoin related apps and they didn't. And saying that they started allowing it because Bitcoin started to get insignificant isn't the right answer imo. They probably allowed it because Bitcoin is slowly getting more attention, because of all the whining of people here in and because some Apple employees probably own Bitcoins and understand that it's a good thing to support crypocurrency apps.
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:37:47
Open source.
IMO, iOS right now is just as open source as Android. Google gradually made Android less and less. The AOSP contains almost nothing today. Google replaced everything from it with their own proprietary apps.
And there's nothing wrong with that, imo. Open source is awesome, but closed source can still work and be awesome.
Regarding transparency, I think Apple is an awful lot more transparent than Google. Sure, they don't say what they're working on and never show any prototypes (because why would they?) and they're usually pretty secret, but I don't see how Apple is less transparent than Google.
You should read this: 
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:34:48
Oh god they do. That's awful
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:51:15
Hmmm for hardware stuff like cellphones I don't think there's anything better than a private and competitive company right now, but good point.
But yeah, those solutions are basically equivalent to jailbreaking, and Bitcoin wallets did exist in the jailbreak world
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:23:36
Keep reading though. It's not all bad and the message is a good one.
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:36:11
With access to the phone's files, a hacker can do anything. So, yes.
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:18:23
What? How can you even possibly come up with that percentage?
It would mean that if I tried to generate a private key 10 times I'd get to your wallet for instance? What?
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:50:08
Some parts of iOS are open source.
Same with Android, but Android is mainly closed source today (just like iOS).
The fact that it's open source doesn't change anything.
But yeah, good point. But still, doesn't affect me or anyone I know
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:43:36
Well it's a lot more complicated than that I'm sorry I don't really have the time to explain everything (And, really, I couldn't and in top of that I'm bad at explaining things).
But there's a lot of info on the Internet regarding that.
Also, if there really was 2256 possibilities, would it mean only 2256 persons can own Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:23:09
The base of it is Open Source, sure. That's what allows companies like Amazon to fork it.
But Google is putting less and less stuff in the AOSP with every update. The AOSP 4.4 doesn't even include a web browser!!! OEMs have to license Chrome or use the old AOSP web browser. Just like it doesn't include a mail client since 4.x.
Will the AOSP 5.x or 6.x even exist?
Meanwhile, FYI, small parts of iOS are open source (  ). iOS definitely isn't open source and Apple never claimed it was.
@_date: 2014-01-27 06:04:10
Yes you're right. I'm on mobile... I saw 2256.. Sorry
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:40:34
Dude that's not what Open Source is.
Hey, ever heard of WebKit? The Open Source web engine that has been created by Apple and is very very very probably powering the browser you're using right now?
@_date: 2015-01-15 07:43:04
Please don't
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:39:06
uhhh so if I understand correctly, you switched to Android because Google is seriously considering bitcoin as part of their mobile payment strategy? wtf
Also, Apple never shares their future plans. They may never implement Bitcoin deeply, but keep that in mind.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:43:56
He took back that tweet where he said it was a scam though
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:24:47

@_date: 2013-12-17 17:46:55
That's why they need to figure things out. How to apply their 30% policy while considering Bitcoin apps as banking apps (because the 30% obviously doesn't apply for banking apps)
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:14:21
It's at 9:24 in the video
Though the whole thing is quite interesting
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:14:51
I'm not trolling, it's facts. Compare the App Store and the Play Store and it's undeniable.
Anyway, if Android phones can have a local Bitcoin wallet, it's one more advantage for the Android devices.
Still doesn't make me switch, personally because I'm a dev and I prefer making 5$ on iOS than 1$ on Android. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:54:32
I'm not making it sound like they're being nice, but I'm just extremely grateful at how good Xcode is compared to the competition (Google's offering for Android, which is literally a joke (but free)) and Microsoft's Visual Studio.
I think the approval process has its place but they should keep tweaking it. It really does help get rid of a lot of shit apps (not all, I know).
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:06:44
Maybe more like Apple II, I'd say.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:33:51
And on top of that, start the chart at 0$ and it's more like a grasshopper jump than a rocket...
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:47:38
Oh, cool. But just to be clear, let's say I go to Tim Horton's, I could use your debit card with their existing terminal and it would work?
Vouchers are cool, though
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:56:13
You don't even seem to understand my argument. They're taking a cut from the developers because the dev tools are free and the App Store infrastructure is cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:28:17
I sort of agree with you.
You probably described a third of people who think like that.
But still, I'd put it in the same category of "psychological" thing as $0.99$ prices.
We know $1.00 is basically the same thing but our brain is still often tricked (at least, mine sometimes is).
I know it's not the same thing at all! But some will want a full bitcoin with all 7 (or 8?) digits.
That's where mBTCs are useful. You can have 200mBTC. Which feels more satisfying than having 0.2BTC (no matter how much you paid them).
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:43:14
A lot though. But yes, it would work with SHA256 altcoins I'd guess.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:12:22
They won't fix that.
You guys don't even understand why Apple removed some Bitcoin apps from the App Store!
There are some great Bitcoin related apps on the App Store that Apple accepted (ZeroBlock, Cointicker, Coinbits)
The reason they removed apps who directly involved Bitcoin is because it sort of fucks with their 30% cut policy which is hard to apply for Bitcoins (for now, at least).
The 30% cut is understandable and I can understant why they apply it to all in-app purchases too (else all apps would be free with an in-app purchase to unlock everything to get 100% of the revenues instead of 70%), but Apple wouldn't get its cut if it did that and would theoretically operate the App Store and the development of Xcode and everything at a loss (yes they're extremenly far from bankruptcy and make most of their money from hardware sales, but still). And the fact that you could do stuff with bitcoins, wich can be considered as a currency, sort of bypassed Apple's 30% cut policies.
They need to find a way to support Bitcoin apps more officially though.
But come on! They aren't sponsored by big banks who want Bitcoin to die or whatever other tinfoil hat theories.
They're just making great hardware and software and want to regulate the App Store experience so it isn't the wild west like on Android with viruses and shitty copycat apps. I don't think they care about Bitcoin as much as you may think they do.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:58:09
The AOSP is getting smaller and smaller with every version of Android, as Google implements more and more closed-source stuff.
Even the Nexus 5 4.4 launcher isn't part of AOSP!
Android isn't nearly as open source as it was before.
Also, that Google fork of WebKit (which is open source and was maintained by Apple (and then Google joined)): not a good thing for the open source movement
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:41:41
Developing for Android is a pain in the ass, not only because of the different screen sizes.
And Android users don't want to pay for the apps they use, so for every dollar made on the App Store, I'd make 30 cents on the Play Store.
The result? The average app goes on iOS first and then get (sometimes badly) ported to Android.
Also, for 95% of people, the iPhone is the best smartphone available for them because it's consistently good for all of its features (best example is the Lumia 1020 who has a great camera but is pretty much crap for the rest). Fastest CPU (for single-threaded operations (and 2nd or 3rd for multi-threaded operations)), best GPU that's ever been in a phone, excellent (and non-OLED!) screen quality and colours, reasonable screen size, efficient OS that gets along well with 1GB of RAM, top 3 best battery life (on Wi-Fi and LTE), camera considered by a lot of people as the best smartphone camera for 90% of shots (1020 gets the other 10%), App Store filled with beautiful and powerful quality apps, update life of 3-4 years (vs a ridiculous 18 months for Nexus devices) and works perfectly out of the box.
I think you're simply ignorant. There are a lot of reasons to own an iPhone in 2013.
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:25:26
Oh, okay.
Can I know why you consider Apple evil, then?
(Other than their In-App purchase policy)
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:11:09
It's psychological
@_date: 2013-11-15 14:16:40
"It's an evil company"?
And I guess you trust Google because they always do the right thing, do no evil and are "open"?
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:41:16
I think you're right, after all.
Of course we'll switch to mBTC or something similar if the value keeps growing because it's much easier and less confusing to say "that'll be 9mBTC" than to say "that'll be 0.009BTC".
But in the end, people will think of a Bitcoin's value in USD, so it really doesn't matter.
Okay I'm tired I don't even know if what I'm saying makes sense...
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:25:25
Come on there ARE downsides to having a half-open marketplace like Google has (who allows all apps to come in and removes them once they're in)
@_date: 2013-12-17 01:00:29
This. Google explicitely removed an embedded tool that let users remove tracking rights from apps in 4.4. No Android "fans" complained. What the fuck is up with that!
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:24:04
I know I'll probably be downvoted for this, but here goes..
The anti-Apple circlejerk here is absolutely incredible. Apple doesn't want Bitcoin to die. If they did, they'd ban all Bitcoin apps from the App Store. That's not what they're doing at all. There is a lot of Bitcoin apps left! A lot of Android fanboys here seem to try to create a "switch to Android" movement, it's really weird.
The problem with the Coinbase app, if IIRC, is that you could buy Bitcoins for cash. Or sell your Bitcoins and get cash. That sort of thing goes around Apple's 30% cut policy which applies to app purchases and in-app purchases.
Sure, it would be cool if there was a way for them to allow apps that do that, but there's no way it's necessary to have that for a wallet!
And there are tons on very coin Bitcoin and altcoin charts apps on the App Store (I'm using ZeroBlock and a few others).
People are literally talking as if Apple was evil and wanted to kill Bitcoin and trap everyone in a prison while Google and Samsung are angels that are saving everyone from Apple's hell with an "open-source" OS (hahahaha) and phones with huge displays.
Anyway, that's just my opinion.

@_date: 2013-12-13 00:17:14
To answer your question more directly, I felt like I had to point out WHY Apple regulates apps in the App Store as strictly as they do.
@_date: 2013-11-09 15:43:02
Oh yes. I should enable Filevault if I do it locally...
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:14:56
Yes check  on Twitter. They're havibg problems with the WDC market so they're temporarily taking it offline.
They made a few bad decisions and got an incredible growth of user base a day after their new website was up so they're having a lot of trouble dealing with everything.
If you submit a ticket they will respond.
I don't think they're a scam but they obviously don't always take the right decisions... But it's getting better and better now
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:32:10
The "debit" cards can't actually be used with any normal cash debit terminal, right?

@_date: 2013-12-17 00:51:49
Google does it for apps and in-app purchases yes. I never said they did it for everything.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:25:14
Fair enough. Bitcoin has arrived!
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:58:47
Good point!
“Because that Bitcoin thing is not legal in all jurisdictions for which BitPak is for sale”
That's a weak argument from Apple (well, the teenager on the phone, should I say). But they should take an official stance on Bitcoin apps so that the rules are clear. Not something weird and unclear like what it's like now (Blockchain app still on the App Store, for instance)
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:08:50
Same situation. Lost 0.9BTC. And I'm not a rich guy at all... Well... I learned stuff using Cryptsy so I guess it's not a COMPLETE loss.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:28:03
That's true! I also forgot about Square!
But you can't buy in-app stuff with those, it's only to buy real things.
Yeah they really need to figure a way to allow Bitcoin wallets. But we're still far from paying our apps with Bitcoins. But they definitely won't ban everything that mentions Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-13 03:16:03
