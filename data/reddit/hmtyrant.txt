I really don't give a shit what people think Bitcoin is. Regardless of what people think, the invention of the blockchain will have a permanent impact. 
You cannot just put that invention back in the box.

And it would also be the truth if one said such a thing is not a real idea but instead the opposite of fixed.

Why on earth are people keeping their coins on an exchange to begin with? I get the day traders doing it, but Gox is not storage. How could people not know to get out of Gox a long time ago?

You could convert it to another coin that is not vulnerable to a 51% attack like PPC (peercoin).

What about using money in a Roth IRA to purchase Bitcoins? Would the gains be taxable if the cash (from selling coins) was held in a Roth for a certain amount of time?

Have you done any research into Bitcoin? If so then what are your thoughts on the blockchain?

I say coins were stolen by multiple parties including GOX.

They honor the price that you bought in at...however sometimes people's orders are canceled because of "security" concerns. I personally have not had this happen yet. 
If it's canceled then you  receive your money back and would have to repurchase at the current price.
