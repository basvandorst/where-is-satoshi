Is this site similar to the concept of e-signatures that was posted on reddit 2 days ago?
I was just pondering about the vast possibilities of non-currency products that kinda piggy-back off the blockchain (such as this). Very cool to see it built. Digital things usually can be copied (i.e. .mp3's). So I guess we'll start seeing .mp3 DRM via blockchain? (proof / signature of the original copy.)

There can certainly be debt in bitcoin.
There will be bitcoin creditors that will lend bitcoin. They will still collect interest or stake and borrowers will pay, irregardless to their savings or ability to save. 
The power of bitcoin is that it gives everyone a choice (vs. forced inflation).

Can you please explain a situation on how one might reuse a public address and this can happen? I don't get it.

Say there's a high amount of btc traders / speculators that just got into the game (i.e. me) but don't have lot's of $$$ to trade with. Obviously, the bigger the funds, the higher the profit. So to clarify my question, are there any sites that allow you to prove your "track record" with say, initially, a game such as this... but then allow you to trade REAL $? 
Mutual funds? Broker? I'm not big into finance so sorry for my incorrect terminology.

If only they knew about bitcoin...
On the other hand, would Bitcoin be a good way to hide $1,000,000 for a year?

First thought: OP is using this site to programmatically buy / sell.
Second thought: Are there any bitcoin hedge fund sites or "games" yet? hmm...
