Exactly. True freedom encompasses being free from government visual oversight. The government is not my parent. They do not need to know what I'm doing online. Who I am talking to. What I'm saying. Or where I said it.
But tis the natural tendency of governments to react in such manners to maintain and preserve their power. It's almost like a hierarchical sense of self-preservation. They will not go down easily.
The end game is for humanity to be so responsible and self-sufficient that a government is not necessary to protect us from anything.

Because I wouldn't want to hinder any possibility of actually getting verified if someone from there happens to see this thread and puts two and two together.

Nevermind. I just found a solution [here]( 
These exchanges outside the US need to stop with their AML/KYC shit. Those are American laws so it doesn't even make sense for exchanges in other countries to follow them even if they handle US dollars.
Just because I use your country's currency, doesn't mean I have to follow your rules.

I've already bought many times from local bitcoins, but my only payment options are Moneygram and Western Union. The lesser of the two evils is Moneygram with a 10% fee, which I have to pay on TOP of the mark up from localbitcoins. It's like adding insult to injury. Fuck that. I want to buy at market prices. I live in a 3rd world country and money doesn't come easily.

The wait to get a visa to move and be able to work in another country with a more stable currency is TOO long. It can be years even. The longer I wait the worse it gets here.

I should when the fiat currency in my country is devaluing by 40% in a SINGLE YEAR. Try living in Argentina and watching your life savings reduced in purchasing power.
