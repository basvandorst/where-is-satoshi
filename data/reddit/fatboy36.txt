That's such a bad meme tho...

Don't stress too much over it, it can take up to a week or more sometimes, but it does hurt to call them if the situation is the same in a week.
Most of the times it takes a day or two for me but it really depends on the bank I suppose

What?... people argue that DCA is the best investment technique and it simply isn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:49:29
It probable won't give you better prices, because the price grows almost day by day, by not buying with every thing you got today you're on average going to miss out because the price is increasing daily

And do you have to pay a vta if you buy with Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:32:15
I wouldn't be surprised as it becomes mainstream that government begin to tax transactions. It does seem weird tho...
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:16:39
DCA might be good for people who don't "really" believe in Bitcoin or are simply not ready to go all in but logic wise to go all in is the best way to go

DCA buying small amount per small amount, let's say I have 10k in the bank and I choose to invest 1k a month that's DCA  but if you earn 2k a month and invest a lump sum when you get paid that's not DCA, the important part is the dividing the sum your ready to invest in a bunch of small investment

You do you, no ones can guess better than you can, it might keep rising or it might crash again If recommend buying 0,5coin now and the rest in the next month.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:10:23
In a year yeah probably, but that's not the goal the goal is a widespread use of Bitcoin or another coin (I'd rather it be Bitcoin tbh), and I'd say the real implementation in daily life would begin in the next 10 years and that would be the death of physical money that'd take 20 years minimum. Btw I'm pulling all of these figures out of my ass, it full of conviction but still.

For a store of value is does fluctuate a lot doesn't it ? I might be wrong but I think it was intended as a currency for daily use not much else...
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:53:21
I'm a bit salty because of the drop (bought before the drop to 5600eu), sorry for the bitchy response 
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:31:18
This is fucking bait. Fuck you

My bad I'm busy didn't have the time to check for other posts
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:37:01
Keep it in and buy more
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:11:56
I guess, it's probably because I don't know either why they're selling that I'm not a trader. They're  probably willing to take a hit to maybe profit from BCH 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:42:13
Well... is it tho ? The day traders are fucking Bitcoin up if you ask me, Bitcoin being way to volatile makes new comers less likely to trust the market and inject more money and grow Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency...
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:54:44
From what I read (not much) it isn't profitable and studies done shows it doesn't work. And like I said you are as likely to buy mostly at an ath with dca than to buy at an atl... if you buy in bulk you be sure you're not buying at an ath which in the end is what were all trying to avoid. I do have my personal technique buy high sell low no matter how I always manage to buy before a dip.

I use coinbase personally and via bank transfer to have the lowest fees

Hope everything gets back to normal

@_date: 2017-11-13 20:41:40
It isn't hard to calculate you just calculate the median price at which you bought you Bitcoin and you set the buy back lower than said price. Wouldn't recommend doing it tho, be safe and hodl. It might sound retarded but the market is too volatile to play around with that kind of money if you ask me. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:28:23
That doesn't seem like a good idea.. The only thing it could be good for is the mental aspect of it, it'd that the feeling out but your just as likely to buy high than to buy low with this technique, I'd recommend buying in bulk
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:46:12
Well tbh is there really a limit on the amount of electricity you are allowed to use ?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:11:41
10/10 might even need to sleep there 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:09:22
But doesn't it feel like you're getting ripped off with everything you buy ?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:30:07
Because it's a dick move not to pay taxes (assuming he doesn't pay a vat)
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:28:44
Well, if you can stay their for free I don't see the problem
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:48:43
I personally can't buy anything
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:42:53
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:02:29
What I don't get is why people are selling now. I can't think of any reasons why anyone should sell now unless they don't believe in technology it self...
