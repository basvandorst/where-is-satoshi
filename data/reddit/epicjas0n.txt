They charge a flat 0.001 btc fee (not a percent), twice as much as other exchanges. I stopped using bittrex because they're greedy AF when it comes to withdrawal fees. They're charging 5 xrp to withdraw xrp when other exchanges are only 0.15 or so.

A stop sell order at 15500 means you will sell at/below 15500 (stop order stop you from losing profit). A limit sell order at 15500 means you will sell at/above 15500 (limit orders are used to maximize profit)

You can also do a wire transfer at Gemini. However, it will take a few days to setup/verify your account when you first create one.

I don't use gdax but did you do a stop order or limit order? Those are 2 very different things. For buy orders, a limit order gets fulfilled when price goes below your asking price. Stop orders get fulfilled when the price goes above your asking price.

Hopefully this is the cause. Good luck OP. Always turn on 2fa,  and I don't mean email/ SMS 2FA since those can be easily compromised.

Where'd you buy your Ledger? They're either out of stock or their prices are being marked up.

A stop buy order  means you're willing to buy at a price above $3500. If you wanted to buy at or below $3500 you should've used a limit order.

2 factor authentication. Whenever you sign into your account  you must also enter a code that is provided by your 2fa program. Apps like Authy or Google Authenticator are good examples.
