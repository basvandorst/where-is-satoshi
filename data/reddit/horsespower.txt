Personal finance would’ve told you stocks are too risky and that you should only invest 25% of your money in stocks, the rest in a CD, while living off $1000 a month, spent on ramen and self help CDs at the thrift store.

He could have been referring to the total exercise value of an options or futures trade which can be 100x the underlying asset, but never comes to pass unless you fucked up bigly.

It's not rocket science. All you need is the value you bought the asset (coin) for, how long you held it,  and the price when you sold it. Greater than a year? 15% cap gains, less than a year? Normal income.

It seems rather timely though doesn't it? This is basically the same chart that anyone who's ever made any real money investing lives by.
The same thing is going on in the market right now. Everyone's piling in because it's at an "all time high." You kidding me? If that's true you should've been in the market three years ago when it was at an all time low. Why do people think there's already more upside after an unbelievable quantity of upside? I was out of equities in late february. I might miss 5 or even 10% but I'll have locked in 40% when people get taken on a ride in May.
You're buying high and selling low. This is not a trading strategy and it is certainly not an investment strategy. Now frankly if I was a true long-term investor I wouldn't even have sold, I'd just ride the dip and pick it back up later or next year. It won't matter because the securities I bought were dirt cheap.
If I'd bought my portfolio today it could be many years before I make meaningful return. Fine in a mutual fund but that's not my horizon.
Basic financial acumen is conspicuously absent amongst this burgeoning corp of bitcoin traders. It's hard to watch.
Edit: Obvioulsy I'm not saying this exact chart is some kind of finance teaching tool. But it illustrates pretty succinctly why it's bad to be the "dumb money."

We learned that lots of people with 0 financial intelligence got caught up in a gambling party day-trading an intangible asset with no inherent value.
Perhaps worse these people have now been scared off "investing" (which it is not) and might view actual investments as similarly ill advised. "No way I'm investing in stocks dude, I got killed in bitcoins that one week!"

This subreddit! lulz!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:59:48
You can tell that from a reddit comment huh? 
Obviously I don't mean that exact chart lol - the point is that in growth investing you don't make money buying the highs and it helps to have at least an awareness of the effect of investor psychology on asset prices.
An investment office? What exactly do you define as an "investment office?"

Didn't post it, simply pointed out that it illustrates an unsustainable hype fueled price run up quite well.

1) That is what a bubble is. Word for word. Congratulations.
2) Thinking your thing "is different, no really, this time it is" is exactly what every person who tries their hand at trading for the first time on the new hot thing is thinking right before they get taken to the cleaners. What are you people smoking that makes you think this is so special?

There are websites that you can short bitcoin with. Since you know the difference between investing and speculating perhaps you can afford to lose that $1000 and this is just some fun you'd like to have. In that case go nuts but if you really want to short something you'd be better served sorting penny stocks by short ratios and doing 30 minutes of research. It would be safer (and by safer I mean still sort of crazy.)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:16:10
Are you interested in it as a vehicle for purchase of goods or because of a potential return? I'm not against someone holding a tiny amount of bitcoin as fun money but you'd be much better of spending that time and energy learning about actual investing on a comprehensive basis.
One is a tool for financial security, the other is a night in Vegas.

Warren Buffet would bitch slap mightily anyone who thinks making a quick turn on Bitcoin hype is investing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:56:42
Obviously not but it's a relatively useful depiction of what often occurs with growth assets that receive a lot of hype. The dot com bubble and real estate prices are the kind of thing I'm talking about here - when psychology takes over from valuation (obviously in real estate the valuations themselves were off.)
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:09:40
What else are you invested in besides bitcoin or are you just day-trading an imaginary asset with no intrinsic value?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:28
Obviously I do not mean this literal chart - if you've been investing successfully for 10+ years and have never heard of "the dumb money" when it comes to growth securities then I'm not sure where you've been.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:17:19
What else are you "invested" in? If the answer is: lots of things - have fun. If it's "bitcoin" - put down the crack pipe.
