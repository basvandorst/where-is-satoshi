From when $3=1BTC?
@_date: 2011-09-15 21:12:24
This. Numerous exchanges that have been started up lately are touting that they are legit US businesses, and rolling out at startup conventions to get their name out.
None of them are seized.
Furthermore, it makes absolutely no difference where the server is hosted. The root of the entire domain system is US located, and the ICE can (and will) seize whatever domains it wants.

@_date: 2011-09-13 23:17:01
So... you are saying they aren't talking about the 'majority control' attack at all. That only makes the title even more incorrect.
EDIT: from what I've read... the new exploit is an *extension* of the 51% attack, relating to preventing the legitimate fork from remaining. Nowhere do they claim they need less than 51%...

Geographically, maybe, but if the US decided to pull domains, it would require manual intervention to keep them running outside the US.

Well, he is a currency analysts, so I doubt that was his target audience. But I agree, he certainly didn't seems to pick the subject up very quickly.
To cut him some more slack, it can take someone with expertise longer to pick up an understanding of something new in their field. He is thinking about a lot more than you or I when trying to learn about Bitcoin. Excessive knowledge can be a distraction.

I don't expect it to go up a dollar a day... the trend for the past several months seems to be +50 cents a day. Still, I would expect the prices to respond *positively* to massive good news dropping. And I consider several major businesses adopting bitcoin for payments, and one well known non-profit starting to *pay salaries* in bitcoin, to be massive good news for a fledgling currency.

Or, refer to your 1st grade teacher's analogy about "apples to oranges comparisons".

In securities, this is referred to as holding. You don't tell someone they aren't holding stock because they don't have the certificates at home.

No, they don't. They make money off of volume. They can only process so many transactions at a time, and extremely low volume transactions / high lag times lose them huge amounts of potential fees.

Hey now, this isn't completely stupid. A counterfeit client is perfectly possible.
In the land of bitscamming, if you try to pay someone and are simultaneously introducing them to bitcoin, you can give them some links to research the topic, a link to mtgox so they can check the value, then your link to bitco1n.org to download 'the client'.

Currency is curreny... if you have official currency to spend you can buy more BTC anyway.  If you don't have official currency, you need to spend BTC. Asking why someone would spend BTC is like asking why they would sell their investments when they could hold them.

No no no, all the other transactions for the same input are rejected outright after one is accepted. There is no confirmation process. On every single node, when it receives the new block, all those other transactions become invalid and are dropped.

What illusions? Snide comments in response to someone's loss aren't exactly insightful. What do you mean by 'holding'? I suppose you think a brainwallet and counter-interrogation training is the only way to truly own anything.
... using the term 'holding' correctly is not a symptom of my philosophical close-mindedness. And while I don't disagree with your views, I'm not in the mood for innacurate pedantry. Frankly, you're being an asshole.

The second joke didn't one-up the previous joke as intended. Explaining that 100bil is more than there are in circulation only increases the fail, since the original joke was more than there are in circulation as well.

I've found there to be a strange phenomenon with btc prices. Normal securities prices follow the news.  It seems that with btc, news follows the prices. E.g. after the recent crash, a Paypal exec mentioned that they were considering adding btc as a funding option. The price seemed to be unaffected by this news.

Don't think there is any need to sync your wallet unless you manually make a new receiving address.
If you copy you wallet to another computer, the send/receive coins, the other wallet will be brought up to date when the client runs again.

Barriers to entry. Everyone who had the ability to fund their account has probably bought to extent to their willingness. Meanwhile there are ~30,000 people waiting for Gox verification, and they will probably spend another week or two once they realize they need to sign up / verify with a new payment processor to fund their accounts.

If I understand correctly, no. Until the transactions are confirmed, you can spend the coins as many times as you want. Only when the block is closed will it be determined which transaction actually happened. When that happens, the rest of the transactions will be rejected.
