*This* is the top comment? 
OK, time to unsubscribe. I subscribed to for news about a virtual currency, not to hear about anarchism.

Genuine question: how do you resolve inter-city/club disputes?
Eg, if my city is upstream of yours, and we decide to divert a river your city depends on. 
Or, say both cities fish from the same lake, and if we both fish as much as we want the lake will be overfished?
Or, say someone from my city goes to yours, beats you up, robs you, then comes back to my city?
At a certain point, you need a central authority to resolve disputes.

If they messed with the network, the value of bitcoin could almost certainly crash. They have no incentive to screw with bitcoin.

Why do I have to register? Bitcoinget.com just takes my bitcoin address and that's it.

And what happens when that shiny new car you bought with your Anarchy Dollars turns out to be a lemon, but the dealer refuses to give you a refund? Or any other kind of dispute arises?
Obviously you can buy and sell things without a central authority. But you need rules to settle disputes, and you need a central authority to enforce rules.

Well, video games require specific calculations to be made over and over again. My understanding is that while Bitcoin mining also requires specific calculations to be made, they are different calculations (ie, if you're mining you're not making the same calculation over and over again). I'm really not sure how it would be possible to make a game out of it...
If you're talking about a video game using the rest of the player's CPU power to mine bitcoins, then you'd just be better off not wasting CPU resources to run the game (not that you'd be able to return any kind of profit on running a miner on a general purpose CPU anymore).

Hi Jake,
Do you have any response to OP's allegations regarding contract length? Are you in fact selling 1 year contracts for less than one year or was OP mistaken?

I'm all for smaller government - but *no* government? How do you resolve disputes with neighbours?
Like it or not, society needs rules. 
More to the point: Even if I'm wrong, and anarchy is right, I see Bitcoin as a totally separate issue. Bitcoin can co-exist with government.
EDIT: I do apologize for the personal attack. I'm frustrated because I expected something different when subscribing to this subreddit, but that doesn't excuse ad hominems. I've edited my previous comment.

I don't think that's how mining works...

Right, that makes sense. Thanks! :)

China is a dictatorship. No referendums.

The article is pretty good, but it doesn't explicitly make the connection that FOMO also drove Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, etc. I think it's right to say that FOMO is driving Bitcoin right now, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.
