They can't look at the addresses inside wallets because...?  Forgive my ignorance, I don't know how their system works in any detail.
I recorded the mnemonic phrase and the URL in a text file which was lost (you might have read my post about a week ago, I deleted that post when their support reached out and told me to open a ticket)
Regarding your phishing question: The identifier is not private, so your question is irrelevant.   They're not providing private information to me, they're helping me find public information that I've lost.  If you lost your ATM card and it can only be used with a PIN, and there is no way to have the PIN changed by another party, would you worry?  Of course not, because it can't be used by anyone else.  Would your bank worry?  Not unless they have reason to believe your PIN has been compromised.  Until then, it's not their responsibility to worry, as they have no liability in the matter.
I can tell them when the account was created, when I last logged in (which was over a week ago at this point), and the password, along with enough details about the transactions to help me recover the identifier.
They have an obligation not to let me try to get them to reset the password, for sure, or act on behalf of the account.  But again the identifier is not private information, it's not encrypted, it's seen directly in the URL, and like you said it could be pulled from my browser history (except I can't, my laptop HD is toast, hence the mess I'm dealing with).   This should be the kind of thing that does not require arguing about to get help with, tbqh.
