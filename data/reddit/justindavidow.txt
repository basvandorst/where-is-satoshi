If you look at this in dollars,  it makes a weird sort of pseudo science. 
If you had bought 1 Jalapano worth of BTC INSTEAD of the Jalapano, you'd break even. 
if you buy the thing now,  you'll never earn the same amount of Bitcoin you spend on it. 
If you want to follow the pseudo science: it's thus:
You can spend (say) $2500 for mining hardware. (presently ABOUT 25BTC)  you receive that hardware MONTHS later,  and mine it for weeks/months/years. In the time you have it (until it breaks,  or what have you) you mine 20BTC,  and sell that BTC at various prices.  (assume the price even works in your favor,  say it GAINS 3% per month,  putting it at a future price of $142 ) You think you've made money, as you're now at $2840 (if you sold all your BTC)  
BUT:  had you just bought $25 BTC,  and held it,  you'd have $3550 worth of BTC. 
Now you may interject and say: "I'm still up over what I paid for it!"
That's true:  assuming the price goes up.  HOWEVER: If you want to make that assumption,  it's silly mine.  Just buy and hold.   If the price goes down,  you lose the ENTIRE value of the mining unit that's now no longer even covering the costs to run it.  If you buy and hold,  you can always liquidate your position at any time at a known loss. 
If it's not going to net you MORE BTC than it cost in BTC, it's not worth it.
Keep in mind:   I'm FOR mining.   BFL is simply a terrible company that has an amazingly talented marketing department.

So...   everything most people buy?
Hate to tell you this:  but that's how distribution works.   almost 99% of the goods the average consumer buys are being resold to them. Often several times over.
