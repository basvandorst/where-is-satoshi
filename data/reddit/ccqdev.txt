The problem isn't just implementation, but also education. Most people don't understand what Bitcoin is and fall back on what they've heard in the media (which of late, isn't a good image). I'm hoping that with the right business case I can push this through, but there is still going to be an internal educational challenge to go along with this as well as a number of accounting questions that need to be addressed. If the cost of implementing a way of tracking and accounting these donations becomes too high, I don't see how it is a worthwhile endeavor, and I imagine a lot of other companies come to similar conclusions (if they even make it that far).

Just realized this is a thing whilst putting together a Bitcoin proposal for the charity I work for... Now I have to try to work out how  to explain this kind of positive thing in my proposal, keeping it businesslike, and without rambling on about an internet forum business folk mostly haven't heard of. But, wow, the more I find out about Bitcoin and the surrounding community the more that I'm impressed!

Please also note that although I've read quite a bit lately about bitcoin, I've never owned any (I looked into mining to learn more but the difficulty rate now looks too difficult for a new starter) - please try not to make assumptions about my knowledge in this area as I don't have a lot of it to currently draw upon.

Are they reputable though? I hold some reservations given everything about MTGOX in the press lately and wouldn't want any potential association for us if another exchange had issues
edit: Used search, looks good! I'll reach out to them now, thank-you very much.

I'll check it out, thank-you very much. I don't suppose there's a similar site that exists for Australian Merchants? I'd like  to reach out to a few to create some case studies.

Done! Would love to open a dialog. The more information (good or bad) the better.

Thanks, I appreciate this a lot given that you're providing both sides of the argument.
"If you're "one of the largest" charities here, then I'd look at leveraging your other relationships. It might be easier to get one of your associated sponsors to accept BTC as a payment method for their products/services and then donate the proceeds to you in AUD." - This is a great statement, and much appreciated... it gives me a great train of thought to work on.
As I understand it tax deductions would not be possible on a donation made in a non-fiat currency, or if it is, I don't see how we would approach it.

He just had his life turned upside down by giving the press information - I'd be reserved about saying anything further that I didn't feel I needed to also.

This could open some accounting issues, however. Ideally we would like people to specify an amount in AUD, and receive the same amount in AUD so we can track everything easier internally. If we introduce a delay between the two then it opens a whole host of financial questions which would make implementing this a much more difficult (and subsequently expensive) process. That said, I don't fully understand Bitcoin, so I could be completely incorrect in this assumption.
