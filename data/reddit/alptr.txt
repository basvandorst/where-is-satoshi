Since when definition of the word cryptocurrency included the word mining in it? Cryptocurrency is a currency that uses cryptography to create and manage currency, XRPs was created in the genesis transaction in the genesis ledger and uses cryptography to manage XRP,  so it is by definition a cryptocurrency.
If we apply your logic to fiat currencies... wait they are not currencies because they are not mined!

Why not issue them eventually? This is exactly the reason why small outputs got banned - because you could issue a ton of outputs and it would cost you nothing, if you are really issuing some stock I'm sure your stock will cost more than a penny.

If it is the point why would they created XRP and will remain in control of 30% XRPs? They themselves see XRP as a hard asset.
If debt was the point of ripple there would be no need in XRPs, there would be no need in making system with central ledger which is susceptible to spam. For a debt based system federated servers which form their own networks is the only real way to be implemented. What happens if syrians would use ripple and their government disables internet? It wont work! All theirs talks about Ripple being a p2p debt based system is a deliberate misrepresentation, it's is a centralised cryptocurrency with the debt system build on top of it so that cryptocurrency itself would appreciate in value even if their system used for debt-only transactions.

Of course it can, but this depends on the priorities of the bitcoin developers, namecoin was started as altcoin because even in 2011 it was very hard to make changes to the bitcoin protocol.

Ripple have XRP as an internal currency which can bee seen as an alternative to Bitcoin because it has some value and can be transfered between users, much in the same way as Bitcoin, and it is used through out the system as a currency for transaction fees

Theirs Ripple protocol is not centralised, but the supply of XRPs and hence the control are. They could implement bitcoin-like mining as way of generating XRPs, but they didn't, they chose premining because they are a for-profit organisation.
Theirs Ripple protocol would almost be an uber bitcoin-like cryptocoin if they chose mining

In a debt based system i don't need to know about other transaction that people make. For example I'm Alice and I trust Bob 1000 USD, I don't care if bob has IOUs of some other participating parties because I don't trust them and I don't care how many million they owe to Bob I trust only Bob and I know that Bob owe me 500 bucks, there is no single reason to have a central ledger where Bob's transactions with third parties are stored, because I don't care. And spam in this system is impossible - I can be spammed only by Bob and if he start spamming me I wouldn't trust him anymore.
Thats why if it were really a p2p debt based system disabling internet in Syria wouldn't hurt that much - all local parties could continue to participate in the system and when internet is turned on they would just settle down their debts with parties from other countries.

I would say that the only currency that can potentially be a competitive to bitcoin is ripple's XRP. The ripple protocol is more about exchanging IOUs, but if ripple will be popular XRPs will have an inherent value - they used as fees in IOU transactions. 
Another interesting project to watch is Payswarm, which is developed by W3C, not an altcoin or cryptocurrency, but interesting nonetheless.

I meant technical superiority, I agree with your quote

This is going to be huge it makes bitcoin indirectly accepted by all mechants that support webmoney, as well as making an easy way to exchange bitcoin to dollars/euro/roubles
