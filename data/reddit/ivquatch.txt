So did Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Goldman Sachs, BofA, etc ad nauseam.
The difference is that Mt Gox's currency leakage wasn't accepted industry practice.

The btc inflation rate is mathematically bounded. No one's gonna discover a large btc mine out of the blue.
Governments don't "believe" in a currency. Ours simply decides what is "legal tender". I doubt it would hold btc simply because its value is so volatile. It might one day accept tax payments in btc by cashing out immediately, which is what a lot of online retailers do.
These are just the practical reasons why our government doesn't officially accept btc. The true reason I believe is political. It has no control over btc. If the government needs funds, it can (roughly speaking) sell treasury bonds to the fed for cash. As long as the market value of us securities remains high, the government can inflate the currency as much as it likes. It can't do this with btc.
Likewise, banks can't loan btc the same way it can USD because it can't leverage its fractional reserves to lend more btc. If they need more btc to lend, they have to mine it. They can't simply turn 1 btc into 10 via accounting magic.

Well, if you think of bitcoin mainly as a store of value, then yeah, I wouldn't buy it either. If fact, I don't own any and I wouldn't buy it as an investment.
I think the remarkable thing about bitcoin (and cryptos in general) is how easy it is to exchange electronically. The transactions happen almost instantly. If you've ever dealt with ACH payments online, it's something you'd appreciate. The ease of electronic exchange is the real value of these new crypto currencies.
