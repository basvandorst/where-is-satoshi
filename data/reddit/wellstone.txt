It seems like the teacher is saying his opinion is wrong about an unknowable thing. If the teacher had graded him on grammar, spelling essay construction or even handwriting. I would have thought she was doing here job but saying his choice of content was unacceptable to a question like "what do you believe will be the biggest technological advancement in your future" implies that she doesn't know how to do her job.  If you put this sub's opinions to the side he could have been saying that a new mouse trap design was the thing he thought was the future and she should have been attempting to help him express why, not judging what. If I were you I would review carefully the rest of your kids homework assignments and any notes or comment this teacher has said or written about your child and think carefully about whether or not that is the right teacher for your child.
