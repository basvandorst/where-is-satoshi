I recall in 2009, Bitcoin Core client has "Get coins" button...

no, only device has destroyed. 
Coins are still at primary address. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 22:05:13
You can put keys to any USB stick and encrypt it. 
You do not need to buy trezor,ledger and other trash. Make your own external vault!

Furthermore, it is starting with 1 and has 34 characters length.

yeah chance is 2^-160
collision between compressed and uncompressed keys. 
@_date: 2019-11-20 04:14:34
Then what is an alternative? Local.bitcoin.com?
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:20:46

@_date: 2018-10-21 21:52:34
fun fact: bombs are generating randomly after first click. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:47:04
Real non-zero wallets with balance are ~3.5M
I have full txt list of them. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:40:46
1.5M - 3M addresses per second on middle 4core CPU using r/vanitygen
or 60-150M on GPU
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:05:39
@_date: 2018-10-19 23:49:57
LBC is not scam. The problem is our code is not perfect, we need more hashrate and more people to collaborate. 
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:08:58
I guess we should but how we know which altcoin will survive?
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:09:36
What if top10 will change in a moment
@_date: 2019-08-20 15:58:07
Will we reach 70% this month? What do you think?

@_date: 2019-08-15 00:11:42
good idea
@_date: 2019-10-15 17:45:08
Why not via Lightning?
@_date: 2019-10-16 07:50:48
I just kidding, relax
@_date: 2019-10-28 23:50:58
Will you open a short from 16K then?
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:00:37

@_date: 2019-06-02 12:09:21

@_date: 2019-06-02 12:37:12
I mean If the current price of 1 BTC ≈ $8,800 they selling you it at $9,100 or higher.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:51:00
What does that mean? 
`07 - 33`
I am dunno.
I guess it's -26
@_date: 2019-06-15 03:26:36
got it!
@_date: 2019-06-02 13:12:03
I calculated random 20 char string contains only digits and lower case. The result was even and symmetrical. There were about 2^29 variants.
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:57:00
Wow, thanks!
Sounds yummy, I will learn it!
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:47:29

@_date: 2019-06-23 04:02:58
Why exactly $19.20? Reveal your math.
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:57:57

could you explain?
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:08:01
is it password manager?
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:50:12
Where is Segwit?
@_date: 2019-02-11 07:40:13
agreed, bad font + inclined difficult to read 
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:56:52
tell me about this GitHub tool. Is it hashcat fork or what?
@_date: 2019-02-11 07:44:05
LMAO, nicehash has a lot of fees and gain full block fees from tip (12.50+N BTC). 
Do you want to try real fair peer-to-peer pool with inblock generated payouts?
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:13:44
wallet.dat is the file where all your coins rest. Wallet.dat gererated by random seed and locked with password. It keeps list of public keys and its private parts.
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:55:24
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:43:58

rent a hashrate and mine on your own pool.
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:10:09
I know mine is not hexadecimal but anyway
@_date: 2019-06-23 04:06:28
why did you short all that time?
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:42:46
p2pool, no withdrawal fees, no centralization, no problems.
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:58:33
Difficulty is good.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:46:20
Your [turn](
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:10:33
electrum can spend any coins(inputs) you have, together or alone, from one address or from dozen. Electrum is strong!

I had a 48.25ms heart attack.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:11:52
I think market will be broken at $4,400
@_date: 2019-06-12 04:52:43
then, it's probably impossible to crack 26rand right now. Please, Don't clean the **wallet.dat** and come here in the near future. We will break this shit!

Your bill is `0.0000000037 BTC `
Tx fee is `0.00008500 BTC `
Welcome to the future.
@_date: 2019-02-25 01:42:52
Yeah, good point. Critical thinking is right way. There are only 21M coins
@_date: 2019-06-15 03:12:57
I guess it's wrong sub. Try to open a support ticket. 
Do you have withdrawal tx hash?
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:39:13
Imagine how many energy banks consume everyday only for printers.
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:59:14
Which one?
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:59:29
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:44:37
We have Localbitcoins, why do we need banks to cash out? 
I hope when BTC hits $1M there will be people ready to buy your coins for cash.
@_date: 2019-04-20 23:45:43
Yes, if your node has static IP and no NAS. Just connect through mobile Electrum.
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:15:45

@_date: 2018-11-19 01:43:42
I assume your wallet operates many addresses because it is more secure. May be you have receiving and change addresses. Learn more about it on your cold wallet web page. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-11-19 01:01:24

It wil literally drop BTC price under zero. It is not how peer-to-peer electronic money should work. It was not BTC or whole blockchain issue. Why should we reorg if one exchange has bad security rules? 
It is lesson for them.

feel free to ask questions like this on r/vanitygen
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:37:11
Electrum is the best solution. Or if you don't trust these servers, Full Bitcoin Core would be good. 
I don't see potential of buying these hardware wallets. You could make your own real cold wallet just with ordinary $2 USB-stick, vanitygen and Linux. Not your hardware - not your coins. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 02:47:43
wow, neat one. 
@_date: 2019-05-18 00:05:49

Wise suggestion, but
I bet that all major exchanges will close withdrawals, just because: `maintenance`
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:11:42
just wait for this week newsmakers then check G.Trends again

@_date: 2018-12-10 23:18:30
lol, exchanges can change your deposit addresses any time they want. You should check it every time you consider to make tx.

What are you thinking about making separated node with BCore? For example with Rasberry Pi or just another Linux server. I have an old Ubuntu server with Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin Core blockchain at my garage. It is serve me 24/7 as Electum local node.

I did not use that. But looks like Exodus wallet. It is good if you need to store alot of alts, but I have only BTC/BCH/LTC and store it securely without any third service soft. Not sure about atomic's privacy. You should do your own research.

Ledger can be compromised with more probability. 
If you're going to make an app for encrypted chat, or perhaps your own computer program for communicating securely, there is one golden rule.
`Don't roll your own crypto, bro.`
Consequently, I will trust only open libraries, big repositories, known linux cores and my own build of OS.
