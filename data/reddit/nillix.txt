Still no. If they weren't *legislatively required to contribute to this unnecessary war chest* they would be profitable.

It's WAY more complex than that. Mortgage backed securities the banks were selling (and making millions on) were based on scrappy mortgages because the banks were pressuring lenders for more loans. 
The only sure thing about it was that it couldn't have happened without everyone's help. The government, the banks, the lenders, the investors, the homeowners.

Wat? No. No there isn't.

[Here's one](
As of February 2012, the usps has built up a war chest of 326 billion dollars to "deal with future retirees."  It's insane, and my personal opinion is it is to hamstring a government agency so the republicans can claim "big government is bad." But that's just my opinion.

No, assuming they didn't have to dump so much into the war chest in the first place, they'd be profitable. 
Look at 2003-2006 [here.](
Several surpluses and the losses were FAR narrower.

Feel free to die on that hill, but I don't recommend it.

Can you normally see the shape of the orange through the lettering like that? Looks doctored.

Oh I get that, but if there is a gain, someone have it up for whatever reason.

Because it is traded on an exchange for standard currency, any profit you make on "bitcoin as a commodity" is going to be made on the shoulders of someone else. Unless you're a miner or accepting bitcoin at a place of business.

I don't think you know how buy/sell works. If the price is two cents, that does not mean there are any huge number of bit coins for sale at that price. I don't know what buying 1 million bit coins would drive the price up to, but I know it would be higher than it has ever been.

Shrug. Poe's law.

How did you have an index fund and a fund manager?

Or a 529. A vehicle literally designed to save for university.

He was probably talking about *price* versus *value*. I wouldn't get into the habit of quoting him out of context. Try this Buffet quote on for size. 


But as near as I can tell, bitcoin isn't supposed to be a commodity or investment. It's supposed to be a currency.

Oh thank goodness. Poe 's law and all that. I'm going to leave it up because I'm quite fond of the quote I posted.
