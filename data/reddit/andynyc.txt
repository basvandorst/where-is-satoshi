Easy to laugh and hodl when you're already rich as hell.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:21:34
Unfortunately, my prediction was true and BTC hit under $9400 this morning. And the original prediction was only 5 days later. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:32:03
I am more concerned with the fact that you apparently have 6 fingers. Not only from an anatomical standpoint, but given the tight venn diagram around men who are both 6 fingered and can stand up a btc node, you may have doxxed yourself.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:44:54
Cool, how do I register to buy these?
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:51:25
Glad to be wrong as I am a believer in BTC, but I wish I was much more wrong (e.g. it rose to $30k). Unfortunately, it appears that we are still headed to under $10k territory based on current market trend.
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:17:22
That's true. It seems like they should remove it at this point rather than have this constant low level stress light.

Captain Buys a Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:57:22
I might be stating the obvious, but is the joke that the man put a space between "May" and "Be" thus invalidating everything he has to say?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:32:16
Assuming it starts higher than this one? Probably a little doggy sneaking a piece of sausage from a plate and running away.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:32:53
And if you are hodling AND buying, raise two hands!
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:42:31
Right, but if you already got rich, then you are in it for the political change.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:44:13
As long as people only play with small sums of money, the press will be fine.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:14:10
High five! It's really cool to see people supporting quality charities investing in our future.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:54:21
Agree, you get a lot of value from that 2% you pay in credit card fees.
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:02:16
Sorry to buzzkill but unfortunately, asset values are way over inflated so that $1MM just a couple years later is really worth something like $500k or so.
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:18:17
Haha, nice. &lt;$10k Bitcoin by March 1st 2018.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:41:52
They lied to your face, like, you went to their office and they were like "Yo, we're Basecoin actually, you want Coinbase, which is 2 blocks over hehehe."
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:17:17
Everyone loves saying this, but if you have even a decent amount of BTC or other hodlings, the various limits make this a challenge. It's like saying "Oh you don't like your neighbor's loud music? Just buy a new home and move there tomorrow." New users can certainly be cautioned or persuaded to start elsewhere, but existing users have to do a lot of work (transition costs) to move.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:45:36
Sometimes things dont work for some people and then they complain to everyone telling them that they will have the same situation. I can say...sending large wires to Coinbase is perfectly fine.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:03:19
No problem - rules are rules! Second prediction will be marked accurate.  
In theory, based on mayermultiple.com we were overpriced and have now just returned to the average of 1.47 200 DMA. It could be 1 month or 6 months before we bounce. I would bank on that being determined by how quickly Lightning Network becomes viable and whether RSK delivers anything interesting.
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:16:26
You're right, but there is a lot of pent up good news coming with RSK and Lightning. The question is whether it will take shape fast enough to avoid another 50% decline. My personal plan is to buy 50% of whatever I can at this level and 50% if it breaks lower into the 8k range.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:30:23

Terrific! This is a really cool concept.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:26:52
This is likely what contributed to bitcoin price increase though. Lots of money in economy so people find places to put it. All commodities way over inflated right now.

Like bdiamond or bgold? They don't really lend themselves to this well. And as clear copies based on the success of bitcoin cash they are more obviously fake. You're right that they detract from the overall brand though. So bdiamond and bgold it is!

It's a lot easier to hodl when you have the quantity of bitcoin you have. When you have your life savings or rent tied up in 2 or 3 btc try following this advice.

Every transaction I sent in the last two days is still processing :'-(
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:44:43
Looks great. Some thoughts: It seems like you could combine the BTC current price graph with the BTC / ETH (or whatever combo) graphs and have a similar toggle to the Buy / Sell. Chat is probably not needed for initial launch. You could expand out the Buy / Sell module to full page and put the trade history beneath and full width as well. You might want to separate balances into a separate page. It's probably best to think of the primary workflows users are going through and segment pages that way (e.g. Check Balances, Buy / Sell a Specific Asset, Manage Account).
Would be interested in investing or helping out in some way in the future as well.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:16:27
If everyone knows about it and price has stalled...maybe it IS the time to sell? Thoughts?

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:39:52

For all the people that needed this explained...seriously? You couldn't figure it out from the context. Don't worry about this story then because you will never be the noob millionaire or the old dude.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:57:36
Why the big discrepancy?
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:03:04
Everytime bitcoin has gone above 2.4X the 200 day moving average it has returned to 1.5X the 200 DMA. 1.5X DMA is about $9.5k as the 200 DMA is around $5700.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:20:42
Yes, correct. Here's the deal from an og:  
- Bitcoin could end up being like the original email protocol. Eventually enough tech and infrastructure was built around it to make up for any inherent flaws.   
- The big risk is that timing sometimes matters. If a second player can swoop in with better technology and gain widespread adoption, can it dominate? The reason most think this is unlikely is that there is an element of "social acceptance" required for a second player to win. People need to be able to craft a story to say something makes sense. Bitcoin, as the first, has this story built into it. It seems fair or even just. A second player would need a similar cultural story built around it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:47
Hope it drops to 10k again personally...
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:17:32
One more coming. Get ready to buy at $9k!
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:48:35
I predict drop to under $9.5k within 3 weeks (by January 12th).
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:40:55
This is why you should think of your crypto assets as a portfolio. Even if you think bch has a chance of overthrowing bitcoin (which it doesnt) you should simply hedge against this by putting say 10% of your portfolio in bch.

@_date: 2017-12-18 05:05:21
Nope, that's unrealistic. $2-3 trillion assumes a 5x increase in BTC or about $100k per Metcalfe's Law. Ever heard of the Mayer Multiple? Go here  and read through or scroll to the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:35:13
People just getting in are hoping for a 5-10X gain still. At only a $600B market cap, a $2-3T market cap does not seem unreasonable before potential drop. It will be a bumpy ride but hodlers know what this like already.
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:38:15
None of you find it weird that someone like Jack can load up on BTC, pump it through companies where he has full authority, and then dump it on you?

This set of statements kinda sold me on BCH. It's pretty dumb to impose an essentially artificial limit on transactions. Steemit processes more transactions than bitcoin so you know It can be done. What's the point of fighting the inevitable?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:00:15
Yes, this is true, but why aren't people just using Litecoin then? It's because people fall for marketing.

@_date: 2017-11-19 17:12:15
And up 0% since the fork happened. You have to compare the BTC BCH ratio. All you are saying is that if you bought low you would be up now. Well yeah, and if my aunt had balls she'd be my uncle.

Why earn bitcoins when asshole rich people will just buy them all up? The idea that we are "flippin the system maaaan" and "this is the biggest wealth transfer in history" is stupid as hell.

The term 'track record' should come with a % success. How many bets has he made and how many have succeeded? Most VCs only expect 1 in 10 to make up for their portfolio. Is he batting more than 10%? You can make mistakes, but we should quantify success if we want to talk about one person's 'track record' being impressive.

1800 bitcoins mined daily. So assuming those get sold, that's $8 million a day that needs to enter the market. Or $2.4 billion this year just to keep the price where it is today.

In theory, a good investment strategy is to "follow the money," the assumption being that this person knows something. But Bitcoin has risen so much that I be scareds!!!
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:35:27
Yes, but you forget that the rich always get richer. Sure, he's a bit late to the game, but he probably owns like 1000 bitcoins now. Because $6MM to buy them is nothing to him.

"All Ver did was invest money" is patently untrue. He spread Bitcoin knowledge and the coin itself around the world. He was a strong advocate in multiple forums since 2010 *and* invested money. Most of these altcoins will fail less because of technology but because they do not have someone as passionate as Roger Ver was to grow initial adoption as a foundation for wider consumption.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:17:17
