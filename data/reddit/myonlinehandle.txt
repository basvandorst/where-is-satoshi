You all sound ludicrous in your speculation, going so far as to suggest multiple accounts being involved in the buy orders yet claiming one man was involved. Arguing that an autobuy of 0.01 was "fishy" in a market that any dolt could see was headed for a crash. Claiming that even if an autobuy was placed at 0.01, that it couldn't possibly have been executed at a much lower price. Get a clue. Or pick up a book. Learn something about that which you argue.

are you serious? you don't understand? if he was trading on mtgox, which any other exchange owner would be forbidden to do, he would be making 0.65, his normal commission, on funds that he never intended to realize. meaning the money didn't actually exist. he could in fact manipulate his own account to display nonexistent bitcoins. you really don't understand the difference between a financial instrument on an exchange and currency, do you?

So, who's the auditor? You realize how ridiculous that speculation is? An auditor? But he's not independent (or we'd know his name), and that means MtGox audited itself? So, it was an employee of MtGox? Think about it logically. A non-independent auditor is like a health claim about cigarettes made by RJ Reynolds employed physicians. If he's not an independent auditor (contracted by MtGox), then he is an employee MtGox.

Haha Sleep!
Someone should ask, "Did this acct belong to the exchange owner?" And if so, why was he allowed to place orders on his own exchange? It's like the casino owner who just plays with his own chips without paying for them. No harm done, right? Except he's charging his opponents a fee to play with him, and yet he doesn't actually have any money in those chips.

"One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins.

**You can spend as much time as you want telling me that a self-professed currency exchange isn't in fact a currency exchange.**
That's the whole point of these posts. That you and everyone else who has money tied up in MtGox doesn't even want to believe that **MtGox's website describing themselves as a currency exchange actually meant they were a currency exchange.**
"So please enlighten me, how is the mtgox exchange different from a stock exchange? They seem very similar to me." - willis77
"This is a single order book, not the fucking forex." - somuchstupid
How could they have been, right? You didn't know currency exchanges were different than other securities? So, they must not be. You didn't know that single-order books are a feature of the stock market (not currencies) to control real holdings, and not a speculative investment (even though neither MtGox nor Tradehill has ever claimed they used a single order book, why would they, it wouldn't make sense, they-don't-deal-in-stocks)? After all, there's no difference between bids/asks and sells/buys, though you'll refer to it as such even when the API of MtGox didn't. A market order can't possibly differ from a limit order, because I didn't know there was one, right?
**I don't care about being down voted for posting factual information** that is challenged with statements like, "He's wrong," and "Don't listen to him," and "The SEC definitions don't mean anything," and "MtGox says its a currency exchange but it's not."
Or, **gulp**, "the stock market is very similar to the foreign exchange."
If you believe that investopedia, or the SEC can't define how a currency exchange works, or that when a currency exchange refers to themselves as a currency exchange, that they are simply lying. That's your prerogative.
If you didn't know that the stock market and it's associated terminologies and infrastructure are fundamentally different than principles of pure speculation in the 40-year-old exchange market (of which MtGox is a part of), then I feel sorry for you.
If you think that the less speculative and less complex stock market is all you can base your understanding of the infinitely complex pure speculation of a 1:1 leverage non-margin fixed-rate currency exchange on, then I feel sorry for you. It's like saying you can fly a plane because you know how to ride a bike.
The more likely answer for the down votes is not that the SEC's definition of a limit order is wrong, or that MtGox wasn't really serious when it described itself as a currency exchange, or that investopedia had fictitious information, it's that **you all** had money in MtGox and **don't like being reminded by facts and dictionaries** (such as the SEC's definition of a limit order) **of how currency exchanges actually work**, because **it simply reminds you of how clueless you were entering into the speculative environment** and how you gobbled up the more abundant advice out there about the stock market rather than the niche complexity that the foreign exchange is and incorrectly applied it to your trades in an illiquid and nascent market (liquid means having market depth, market depth means it takes a humongous [larger than 500,000] order to shift a currency's price).
You're right somuchstupid, even though the SEC maintains a definition that matches every security brokerage on the planet, the terminology shares no basis in etymology with the "limit orders" that MtGox uses.
You can't be bothered by **definitions.** Like what a limit order is, or slippage. You can just state "mtgox doesn't work like the foreign exchange," (even though it exists to exchange currencies and has modeled itself upon the foreign exchange, its professional brokerages, and their terminologies, thereby making it, in fact, another brokerage within the foreign exchange) with nothing to basis the statement on but apocrypha, or simply "don't listen" or "luls" with no intelligent rebuttal.
I'm not the sucker who'll never retrieve my cash. Or whose bitcoins will be worthless on every exchange by the time that they can. You are.
Either learn a little about the foreign exchange and then transfer your knowledge to Tradehill or to other brokerages (perhaps ones that trade only in government-backed securities), or perish by listening to fools applying stock securities comprehension to the foreign exchange market.
Your choice.
@_date: 2011-06-21 18:25:57
Yes, posting to relevant articles that explain how a forex market, **which is exactly what MtGox is**, works is rudimentary.
It's much better to insist over and over again that MtGox is not a foreign exchange. Right?
You can spend as much time as you want telling me that a self-professed currency exchange isn't in fact a currency exchange.
@_date: 2011-06-21 15:34:52
First, there is no uptick rule, which is kinda the crux of this whole argument. There is no such thing as insider trading in the currency exchange market. 
Here's a page on the differences an a refresher on what financial instruments are (nothing!). 
First off, people. (1) The foreign exchange market is not the stock market. (2) There is no regulating body of the foreign exchange brokers. (3) You aren't actually buying currencies, it is purely a speculative market. (4) THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS INSIDER TRADING IN CURRENCY EXCHANGES!

I'm guessing you lost big.
And judging from your user overview here on reddit, you also had your gmail account hacked, "had a MtGox account before the hack, and apparently someone used the leaked details and password information to try to get into my Google account."
Yes, I can't possibly know what I am talking about, because stating something, then linking to the exact fact being stated in multiple posts with multiple trusted sources is too much for you to handle.
I realize it's complex, but if it's too complex for you: LEAVE.
You're hurting bitcoin, no wonder it's in this mess because some of you entered a market that you are still "learning" about.
1: (Limit orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled at the price entered)
2: (Market order books and limit order books are completely different)
3: (Foreign Exchange markets are completely different than Stock markets)
Is that easier for your pea-brain?
Why participate in an argument about a recent crash in a currency exchange when you are still trying to learn? I'm not here to explain to non-investors how securities work, but it appears this is a thread rife with them.

see above, if you dont understand how the owner of an exchange trading on his own exchange, unthinkable, and still earning commission is bilking, then I can't help you. the money traded on an exchange isn't real. it's like the casino owner playing tables with his own chips that he never actually payed for and charging people commission on entering bets with him.

MtGox has stated it was a single account.
    First, Kevin is entitled to those buy orders. Bitcoin, and ipso facto it's markets, is supposed to remain free of influence even during events that result from fraudulent orders being placed. That's the point, right? So, if a hacker wants to intentionally destroy an exchange by exploiting it's illiquidity and lack of market depth by placing a fair-sized sell order to crash it's price using stolen funds, and then a third-party wants to take advantage of the cheaper prices with buy orders at $0.01, they can. That's the point of avoiding the Federal Reserve's model of central regulation.
    Most likely, the owner of mtgox was running a scam where he bilked users out of 0.65 percent commission by trading on his own exchange with 500,000 btc in a private account—this is why the owner of an exchange and the sole-recipient of commissions earned through trading shouldn't be allowed to place orders on the market he singularly owns. He was essentially making money out of thin air. Unfortunately for the owner of mtgox, who maintained this acct, the scam wasn't merely the source of his money, it was an entire infrastructure where he also kept his ill-gotten earnings in a virtual bank, not yet unrealized in a personal wallet.dat.
    So, when his personal account was compromised—and an intentionally market-destroying sell-order was placed—it presented a wry problem for the owner of MtGox. People have made money on MtGox, it's a foreign exchange—albeit an illiquid exchange with no market depth (hence: the Crash)—unfortunately for him, those who profited did so by cashing out and turning the financial instrument of the exchange into bitcoins which now lay in their personal wallet.dat files (you don't think because mtgox says you have 200 btc, that you actually have that, do you? Inside the exchange, they are merely "financial instruments" waiting to be cashed out, like Kevin's 650 or so btc, that's how exchanges work, like chips in a casino).
    The owner of MtGox apparently thought the virtual realm of his own exchange was a better place to keep his earnings (as unrealized profits, rather than cashing out). Now, he has a huge incentive to reverse this trade, since he had lost both the infrastructure of his scheme and the unrealized bitcoins made through commission that laid within. He'll never make a cent without violating the no-regulation principles and everything bitcoin used to stand for.

Unbelievable,, you still think you are buying stock? Hopefully, you didn't trade on a currency exchange with your above thinking. MtGox is a currency exchange. This conversation has become pointless. I can't believe that you people think you can change anything about the financial system when you don't even marginally understand how a currency exchange differs from the bids/asks in the stock market. It's laughable!

It is people like killerstorm that are the reason bitcoin is and will continue to fail. (I'd stop replying too when my only significant addition was, "So how do you think they function?") It is infuriating that people like him without the slightest knowledge of the foreign exchange market are participating in this debate. It's like asking Muslims advice on charging interest.
Who has asked what an **order book** is? No one, however, you clearly do not understand the concept of a **limit order book**, and **market trading** seems to be the only thing that sounds familiar to you (as pointed out by your link to Tradehills charts).
Are you that stupid? Please, tell me you haven't spent any money on these forexes! Or if you have, let me know where. Stupidity is good for the market.
We are talking about the volatility and risk of buy/sell limit orders. 
I cannot believe that you continue to refer to bids/asks. I just can't.
"MtGox says that trade happens at price of order in order book. E.g. if there is bid order in there and somebody places ask then actual trade will happen at 0.01. This was on MtGox web site."
You honestly think this at all relates to the volatility of limit orders placed on exchanges? It doesn't.
You have no clue what you are talking about.
**You still think that buy/sell limit orders are GUARANTEED to be fulfilled at the price entered, it's called Slippage**, NOTHING goes in an order book until the buy/sell limit order is executed, which can happen at a much higher or lower price than entered depending on if its a buy/sell.
Despite the fact that the SEC link I posted, and EVERY SINGLE FOREX broker states otherwise, **you continue to insist that a buy limit order placed at $0.01 will execute at only $0.01.** You people are the reason bitcoin has failed. Idiots.
**You're all scratching your heads because a buy limit order executed at a much lower price than entered?** IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME! Even the SEC has to state it on their website. Good grief.
Not once have I heard the difference between market and limit orders discussed outside of my explanations, yet you are all discussing limit orders in terms of market orders. Not once have I heard the difference between positions and orders discussed, yet the two seem to be constantly confounded by you all.
**1: (Limit orders are not guaranteed to be fulfilled at the price entered)**
**2: (Market order books and limit order books are completely different)**
**3: (Foreign Exchange markets are completely different than Stock markets)**
**If you are still in the process of "learning" how speculative securities work, then get out of the debate on the crash. It's like walking into a room with a bunch of people speaking Swahili and trying to enter their conversation by knowing only one word.**
This is all extremely laughable to me that any of you would even consider investing in a speculative security without knowing the differences between askbid/buysell, market order/limit order/stop order, positions/orders, forex/equity market, market order books/limit order books, and on, and on, and on... It's hilarious. Now, I know why 1% of all traders on forex markets are from English speaking countries (U.S./U.K./Canada/Australia/New Zealand). Because you're all idiots.

willis77, you have got to be the most idiotic person in have ever chatted with. the currency market is a PURELY speculative market. the two are similar only in how wagers are made, not the underlying concept behind them. it's like comparing the options/futures/derivatives market to ordinary stocks. pure speculation is what is happening, people are making money off wagering the value of a currency, what they cash out with is not tied to the buy/sell order unitary amounts in any tangible way. you're an idiot for making people think otherwise. just search, "what is a currency exchange," or "currency exchange v stock market." you are unbelievable retarded. literally, retarded. not an insult. you are of lower intelligence to insist the two are the same because they place wagers using similar terminology. I am absolutely stunned that there is not a single person here willing to take a stand against such a blatantly incorrect view of currency exchanges. not one.

"A limit order is not guaranteed to execute. It's called slippage.  A limit order can only be filled if the stock’s market price reaches the limit price.  While limit orders do not guarantee execution, they help ensure that an investor does not pay more than a pre-determined price for a stock."

Then you said, **"I'm not asking for the difference between Forex and a stock exchange."**
You asked me **how a currency exchange (foreign exchange) differs from the stock exchange.**
Quit backpedaling, idiot.

Quite frankly, you're an idiot. The currency exchanges are far from the stock market, so don't compare the two. It's called scalping, and I do it myself. It doesn't take a genius to watch the news, anticipate pip increases, and make sure you cover the spread.

Yeah, I agree Blurpity. I would say, the people on the forum seem to take one of two stances (A) Regulation is necessary, or (B) Bitcoin should never be regulated. "When" is only important to the former, and Kevin was obviously a believer--unlike most at bitcoin.org--that Bitcoin should never be regulated, the latter. This whole currency is a joke. A pump and dump scheme, where idiots invested, talk up the currency, and hope it increases in value. There only incentive is to maintain profits, not use any alternative currency to the dollar. The system was destroyed because it was tied to the dollar. Simple as that. Why try to be different from the dollar and the U.S. Treasury and the Fed and then copy every single market, exchange, and regulatory measure they enforce? People on this reddit thread do not even have the intelligence to know the difference between a currency exchange, the commodities/hedge market, and the stock market, or even the drive to do a search on google for it. It's just sad. And more telling of the general intelligence of the bitcoin community, and more convincing that the whole thing was a scam in the first place to lure these idiots in to lose their money on a market they don't have the slightest clue about.

Well, that's my point. Though, he can increase the commission made by keeping his money in that account, and just increasing it's size. It's like Madoff if Bernie hadn't put his profits into a bank and instead had them sit unrealized in a currency exchange. When his acct was compromised, probably by someone solely intending to destroy MtGox for no other reason than to destroy it, he lost all of these unrealized gains. It's like margin trading, and never cashing out and just leaving your profits in your trading capital.

It's because you're not talking about foreign exchanges. You talking about bitcoins, dwolla, and banks.
Your math there amazes me:
"Then I traded that ONE dollar for TWELVE (12) bitcoins.
Now I have TWELVE (12) bitcoins.
Then, I traded TWELVE (12) bitcoins for ONE HUNDRED SIXY FOUR (164) dollars."
You bought 12 bitcoins in your little experiment for $1, and managed to sell them back for $164, without an exchange ever being involved. You think bitcoins became astronomically more valuable by some other method than MtGox/Tradehill's exchanges?
The stupidity of this group amazes me. We can have an entire argument about a foreign exchange dealing with bitcoin, and then a thought experiment as a new argument that completely omits foreign exchanges.
People are literally so stupid here that they believe the process will operate without an exchange to even exchange the currency!
Now, apparently this group thinks you can **exchange** bitcoins for dollars at a profit without using a currency **exchange** and speculation to drive up its value significantly.
Listen, you all obviously had money tied up in MtGox and lost a significant amount, or maybe it wasn't significant, but it was some amount. I understand that you're looking for any group-think answer that might make it seem like you knew what you were doing all along and made all the right moves--but you didn't, because you don't.
I don't have a dime waiting in MtGox limbo, I have no personal motivation. My knowledge of currency markets that MtGox based themselves on was by actually trading on them, not by jumping into an ersatz-pastiche version of the real currency exchange and a real brokerage.
It's interesting to me that heartbraden, willis7 and the others have all lost big on MtGox troubles. Similarly, that they cannot manage to present even a modicum of knowledge of forexes, and they remain the most opposed to the idea that how MtGox and a Currency Exchange actually works, is completely different to their layman's (and incorrect) understanding of it as a variant of the stock market. It isn't. You lost because you're outclassed and under-educated.
I can remain objective, because I have no lost funds like they. Please, think about spending some time in college, or reading investopedia, or rather, pay someone else to do this for you.

(2) Why would he leave with 650 or so btc ($10,000/tradehill) and then tell others?
(3) You do know that automatic buy/sell orders (like limit/stops) are not guaranteed in any currency exchange. So, an autobuy placed at 1 btc might actually only purchase the currency by the time it has reached 0.5 btc. It's called volatility. 
This discussion is clearly filled with those didn't even trade on MtGox, or did and have not even the basic understanding of pip changes in a forex.

haha Biased parties who don't want bitcoin to succeed? That's like saying people who tell you not to get involved selling Amway just don't want it to succeed.

No! You know why a buy order of that many units at $0.01 during a crash initiated by fraud isn't suspicious? Because this is bitcoin, people. All of it's markets, including the exchanges were to be free of central control and regulation (like the Federal Reserve imposes). So, we all should assume that capitalizing on this crash is how the system was designed to run. It's not weird, at all. MtGox is far from a legal currency exchange, let alone something to look to brokers like Forex and eToro for examples. This is bitcoin. Not the U.S. Treasury.

First, Kevin is entitled to those buy orders. Bitcoin, and ipso facto it's markets, is supposed to remain free of influence even during events that result from fraudulent orders being placed. That's the point, right? So, if a hacker wants to intentionally destroy an exchange by exploiting it's illiquidity and lack of market depth by placing a fair-sized sell order to crash it's price using stolen funds, and then a third-party wants to take advantage of the cheaper prices with buy orders at $0.01, they can. That's the point of avoiding the Federal Reserve's model of central regulation.  Most likely, the owner of mtgox was running a scam where he bilked users out of 0.65 percent commission by trading on his own exchange with 500,000 btc in a private account—this is why the owner of an exchange and the sole-recipient of commissions earned through trading shouldn't be allowed to place orders on the market he singularly owns. He was essentially making money out of thin air. Unfortunately for the owner of mtgox, who maintained this acct, the scam wasn't merely the source of his money, it was an entire infrastructure where he also kept his ill-gotten earnings in a virtual bank, unrealized in a personal wallet.dat. So, when his personal account was compromised—and an intentionally market-destroying sell-order was placed—it presented a wry problem for the owner of MtGox. People have made money on MtGox, it's a foreign exchange—albeit an illiquid exchange with no market depth (hence: the Crash)—unfortunately for him, those who profited did so by cashing out and turning the financial instrument of the exchange into bitcoins which now lay in their personal wallet.dat files (you don't think because mtgox says you have 200 btc, that you actually have that, do you? Inside the exchange, they are merely "financial instruments" waiting to be cashed out, like Kevin's 650 or so btc, that's how exchanges work). The owner of MtGox apparently thought the virtual realm of his own exchange was a better place to keep his earnings (as unrealized profits, rather than cashing out). Now, he has a huge incentive to reverse this trade, since he had lost both the infrastructure of his scheme and the unrealized bitcoins made through commission that laid within. Now, he'll never make a cent without violating the no-regulation principles and everything bitcoin used to stand for.

We are talking about currency units within a foreign exchange.
I'm not sure where you mention this in your step-by-step? Oh, wait, you didn't. What a pointless thought experiment.
And what "politics" are exactly to be left behind?
As for your final question. The monetary units exchanged in a currency exchange are imaginary financial instruments. The money that you give MtGox or Tradehill is simply a "fee" of sorts to utilize these imaginary units, which do not become actual monies again until you make a profit and request for that profit on your gambling activities to be paid.
**It's like chips in a casino**, but since it's a pair of currencies BTCUSD, you can buy the chips to gamble with in either BTC or USD and cash out in either BTC or USD. Make sense?

It's called market depth, the primary measure of a liquid market, and bitcoin doesn't have it. 
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:54:56
and? it proves nothing. many people did this. bitcoin climbed in 6 digit percentages and you didn't think a crash would come after the 35% drop last week and the guy that lost the large sum through theft? give me a break. I would've placed a buy order at .001
@_date: 2011-06-21 16:02:30
this isn't stock, for one. are you people serious? **there is no such thing as insider trading on the currency exchanges.** there is no bid/ask price on a currency exchange because nothing is actually exchanged! it's a wager using sell/buy orders of imaginary numbers.

(1) You're car is overvalued.  No one will buy.
According to NADA. You're car, with mileage is only worth about $11,475 at Clean Retail or an Average Trade-In of $7,700.
At around $13/BTC right now, and you're asking 1195BTC, that means you're selling the car for $15,535.
If one takes the average of the above two quotes on actual market value ($9,588), you're selling the car for 40% more than the car's worth (around $6,000 more, to be precise).
(2) You have to pay sales tax on the -purchase price- of the vehicle. I'm not sure why some are suggesting reference table values that are meant to confirm the submitted tax-payer transaction values. That would be fraud—in any state. I'd like to see you pull out a ball-park figure from a reference table in an audit for a major purchase and have the number be lower than what you paid. It would be funny. Funny like you reporting the purchase price at FMV for a lower sales tax burden and the buyer being taxed on the full amount he received. (3) In PA, that's 6 percent, but in Allegheny County, it's 7 percent. In Philadelphia, it's 8 percent. (4) Calculate the exchange traded value of BTC in USD (as I'm sure you already have) at the time of purchase. You'll need to do this even if you view the transaction as a barter. Virtual currencies used in the 1970s for bartering clubs were determined to have a FMV, just like bitcoin today. These virtual currencies were the reason the IRS decided to tax barter transactions. Both items being bartered, the car and the bitcoins, have a market value and are subject to a tax. The amount of the transaction is not taken into consideration. (5) I think by reference table you are referring to the legal Arms Length Principle, or transactions not at arm’s length. This is meant to increase the tax levier's revenue in the event that something is sold for less than it's market value. e.g Selling a car to a relative or employee for $1. It must be within 80% of the FMV.
See Section D
(6) Basically, you pay the 6% tax on the purchase price OR FMV whichever is higher.
(7) Do the bitcoin thing. On Form MV-4ST, have the transaction declared as a gift from the seller and pay $0.00.
NOTE: These laws are available online. It's funny to me that consensus here produced an illegal and wrong answer.
See page 3 and 4 for the statutes in PA regarding sales of vehicles. ("Tax is to be collected on the full purchase price...")
Does the bitcoin/reddit community seriously accept pea-brained consensus as fact, now? Seriously, why has no one else looked up the statutes like this?

So, you're asking us to inflate and buouy the value of bitcoin by spreading positive articles around about it? Pump and Dump! Unnecessary. Bitcoin will exist whether or not speculators can make money off it.

They still are since you only withdraw the difference made on the wager. Bro.
The lack of margin trading at MtGox can be confusing to those who have never traded on the REAL currency exchange (as you've claimed to have) with a professional broker, and can make you think it's real money inside.
**It just isn't.**
"Virtual Coins" is a bad choice of words, since that implies a direct relationship in value between what you withdraw and the wagered units being made on the exchanges. 
They are financial instruments, a sheet of paper with numbers written on them that you place wagers upon that influence their changing values. The money you get from winning or losing the bet is the only thing real. The units traded are completely fictitious.
It's complex, I know.
Say, there is a gambling contest. In the pot is $2 in bills that are constantly changing value ever so slightly. It costs $2 to buy in. But once you buy in, your money doesn't add to the pot. It remains the original $2, you only pay for the cost of placing a wager, which happens to be an amount identical ($2) to whats in the pot. MtGox is analogous. You didn't trade your $2 for the $2 in the pot, you paid $2 to gamble on the pot, and if the $2 being gambled upon goes up or down in value. You make a profit.
If you had traded with leverage. It would instantly become apparent to you that the imaginary inflated amounts of a 100:1 leverage margin account are no more real than a 1:1 leverage.
