Leave him be.  We all can't be euphoric.

I find it slightly amusing that you A) didn't just go outside with him and give him the £5 and B) You gave him the "worthless" fiat equivalent of £5 in bitcoin.  If bitcoin is going to increase in value, why not just give him a pence worth in bitcoin?  Or if you truly believed in bitcoin why not give him 1 bitcoin?  Are you afraid of losing the "worthless" fiat equivalent of $350USD?

That's as weasely as weasely can get.  Are you trying to fool yourself or everyone else?

You should be talking to a lawyer about that not strangers in an internet forum.

What kind of shitty  account do you have?  I have an ebay account with a premier paypal membership and I get funds as soon as they pay

Hey hey hey.  I'm the one giving the advice here.

If you are paying in the 'fiat' equivalent of rent in bitcoin you are not paying in bitcoin you are paying in 'fiat'.  Don't be a dishonest dipshit

How is this not a direct copy of the million dollar homepage? If hypothetically you "believed" in bitcoin then the price to be put up should be optional or free.
