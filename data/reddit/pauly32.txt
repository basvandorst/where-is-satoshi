Just to confirm, I originally used the fee that was recommended by 0.12 so I will obviously need to go higher than that.

thanks anyway, I might try sending another transaction a little bit later although when I tried last time it didn't seem to propagate.

I can't send again because my new transaction will not propagate.

Just to confirm, are you suggesting I should send the same amount to the same recipient but with a higher fee? Because I already tried this and the new transaction did not propagate. I left it overnight and the next day the new transaction was still unconfirmed and did not show up on any block explorer sites...
edit: You mentioned I need a direct path to the miners, is there any way I can relay directly to them?

OK so just shortly after I made this thread the original transaction has actually been included in a block! Just to be clear, I didn't do anything strange when I made this transaction as some people seem to be insinuating. Whenever I want to make a bitcoin transaction I always ensure I have the latest version of the client and that I am up to date with the blockchain with the correct port open and plenty of connections. I then make the transaction using the default value for the fee.
The lesson I will take home from this is not to trust the fee suggested by the client and to personally check the status of the mempool in order to ascertain how much fee needs to be included in order to be prioritised by miners.

I don't know enough about the estimator logic to file a bug report other than sharing my experience. I might do that after work if I have time to figure out how to report bugs.

Holy crap, it was just confirmed!!! FYI it is around 61.5 hrs after I created the transaction. Thank you for the help anyway.

Ok thanks for this information, I will try to send another new TX with a higher fee after waiting a few more hours since another commenter says that the mempool size is falling.
