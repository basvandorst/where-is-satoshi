PhoneGap/Cordova it and then you have a native app too. ;)

You're right...I assume (wrongly) that if someone is hashing X rounds that they'd be using a salt. Good question.

Make it $0.85 cash or BTC so they realize that not having to deal with change is awesome.

I seemed to notice that you can't purchase into bitstamp or other places like you could a couple of weeks ago. Something odd there.

I used that site for a recent 1btc transaction and my 0.0005 transaction took over 8h for the first confirmation. Odd since it should have been less than 2 confirmations.
Is it possibly because the size (number of bytes) was so large?

I saw some others mention this site today. 
I think it has escrow and other services for online trading.

The partial harassment is because the bank tellers don't want to see the unsuspecting scammed. There's a reason that the Nigerian Prince scam and Mail-Order brides exist. Once the money is sent game-over just like BitCoin.

invalid captcha. chrome with an adblocker but disabling it doesn't help
@_date: 2013-07-18 01:08:49
it looks like the captcha is being served in http while the rest of the site is https. if I allow unsecure content in IE I can see the captcha box otherwise it's missing in both browsers.

I love the catch-phrase "Boom! Hash chain transaction or it didn't happen."
@_date: 2013-10-04 14:10:30
from somewhere below - yes.

Maybe he just forgot his password. Think of all the lost bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:21:05
AFAIK, blockchain.info just reports blockchain information. All the bitcoin-qt clients, et. al. store the chain distributively and the miners create/add to the chain.

According to this Ars Technica link the botnet owners removed the bitcoin aspect a little while back. 
FTA "Until recently, that cost was much higher. ZeroAccess used to force infected machines to perform the computer-intensive cryptographic operations required to generate bitcoins."

No tables running. Any way to add some bots during testing phase?

Fair point - that variance currently only affects you if you're under ~90MH/S. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:50:16
"higher variance" is only because of the hashing power. It's similar to any pool. If more people used it, then the variance would be reduced.

Mine says "a few hours" but same problem.

But they're not restricting your rights. They are making sure you are aware of the consequences.
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:30:37
Thank you for being such a kind person.

It's certainly not benevolent, but in this case your goals are aligned. The bank doesn't want a pissed off customer blaming them.
I'd say it's like the guard hound looking out for the hen's best interest. Usually they work together, but every once in a while the dog snaps a chicken's neck.

I've been fortunate enough to not install java for the last 4 months. If the security risks don't bother you the constant nags to update should.

FTA: "If you used the same password on bitcointalk.org as on other sites, you may want to change your passwords. Passwords are hashed using sha256crypt with 7500 rounds (very strong). The JavaScript that was injected into bitcointalk.org seems harmless."

It's not as funny, but more SFW: 
It's likely where this site is getting the coinbase feed from.

When I bought a cert from a new CA they gave me this chained/intermediate cert that I could serve so that it would be trusted. Something like Verisign-&gt;StartCom Intermediate-&gt;My cert. AppHarbor (Heroku for .NET) allowed me to install it next to my cert.
