Yes amazon has the NON Premium - non 600omh (need an amp with 600 but not the 250 verision) for 150 bucks!!!!!!!!!! This one is 250 omh - 
edit you have to click on the 250 OMH PRO to see the $153 dollar price tag

And can be as fresh as can be. Why knee? Subliminally we feed the need. Not greed , weave and heave so smoothly.

It saved me near 200 dollars and the company gets more profit because theres less shark fees through the transaction process. I'm looking at you Paypal. Win for me and a win for online businesses... So yeah magic.

He said diversify brah. So take that 10k and put 2k in btc and the other 8k for savings till you can play with more fiat and sleep at night with ease.

The tubes are swappable if you want to change the sound signature slightly. Found a review of the amp here -

I was also able to buy DT990 premium headphones 600 OMH (groupbuy) from Massdrop for $250 instead of Amazons 350 USD. 
AND because of Bitcoin price increase over several months I really only spent 100 usd to get a 350 dollar product. I bought bitcoin in the summer when the price dipped.

Yeah I think the amp owner decided on some tubes he liked better. I really want the WOO AUDIO 7 DAC/AMP combination
