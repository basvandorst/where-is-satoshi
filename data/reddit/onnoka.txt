Yes it is. And Yes it is. 
You get an IBAN number and you can send and receive money to and from other bank accounts. Tell me, how is this not a bank?
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:46:25
That thought has gone through my mind too. Can’t prove it though.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:55:47
Told you so. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:37:25
We will know in about 23 minutes.

I think they add ‘European’ because some people might not know that Lithuania is in Europe. 
Anyway, you got a lot of questions, and I do not work for the bank. 
Why not try emailing the CEO? And add the answers here? ;-)

Or Ardor. Until people will learn of Ardor. Or, at least they should. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:47:31
HODL. It is that easy.

I hate those click bait articles. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:55:42
Ardor. It’s much better tech. Proof of stake, child chains &gt; No bloat, environmentfriendly. And not just a whitepaper, it’s live and working already. See  pretty cool huh!

Another click bait article?

Ardor trading is finally open @ Bittrex. Doing way better than Bitcoin now and it truly is one of the best coins to invest in. Did I say coins? I meant tech. The tech is outstanding, live and ready for business. It will be a nice feud between Ardor and Ethereum this year.

Also, when Ardorgate is live, you can easily exchange $Ardr to and from Euro.
Jelurida, has partnered with Ardorgate to deliver an Ardor based Euro pegged child chain token named AEUR.
“The new AEUR token provides a quick and simple entry point into the crypto world using Euro. Each AEUR token will always equal exactly 1€ and this is guaranteed and backed by Ardorgate, which has partnered with MISTERTANGO bank as the payment processor.
Using the AEUR token users can trade assets on the Ardor platform and easily exchange into ARDR or child chain coin/token.”
This is really innovative and will make Ardor even better accessible.

Well, like I said. I have a proper IBAN number in my name there. Try it for yourself, you will see. 
I have sent money from my other European bank account. After a couple of hours, it was on my Mrtango IBAN account. 
I will also get a plastic bank card that I can pay with and get money with from ATM. I do not see a difference.

Is too soon to call it?
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:27:53
Ardor and Ignis. Plain and simple: an innovative proof of stake Blockchain with child chain support that has been proven over the years by its predecessor $NXT.  Ardor is a working product and not a whitepaper that may or may not have been copied. And it’s priced absurdly low. (Yes, still waiting for Bittrex and Poloniex, but they are almost ready)

Ardor ($ARDR), Nxt, Ripple

So, that’s your definition of eating then? That you have to be able to feed on it? In that case, you can keep the ball ��

Well, you actually can eat gold. In some restaurants, they dress up food and drinks with gold flakes. 
There is also vodka with gold flakes. 
But we get what you mean.
