Hahaha.  For the short term I'm not buying anything with my bitcoin. Your saying that until I do make a purchase or conversion, I'm not required to report owning or purchasing bitcoin to the IRS? I'm asking for this year. I honestly don't plan on spending any of my bitcoin anytime soon.

So in other words, until my "gains" are manifested through converting bitcoin back to USD and I only hoard, I'm tax exempt? No need to even report on turbotax?
This leads me to another question. If I never convert back to USD and simply use my bitcoin as a currency further down the road as it's assimilated more and more, will I never have to pay taxes on owning and spending bitcoin?

Your'e saying it could still drop more? I'm debating on grabbing a precious coin as we speak. Hoping it will drop below 375.

I got the same exact message!

Is it somewhat intuitive? I'm not really computer tech savvy. I understand bitcoin well but when people mention github and using linux thats over my head. I'm just trying to safely and easily hoard my precious coin.

I just watched the video with the kid narrating haha. Looks easy enough. What's so much better about a web wallet?

Thanks for the heads up. I'm not super technically inclined. I just want to store my coins, no spending, only hoarding. Also I'm using a mac. That being said what would you recommend?

I should probably make a separate post for this but, How does the IRS know? I just transferred my small BTC fortune from coinbase to my trezor wallet and I was prompted with a message asking if I was sending it to another BTC exchange. I'm assuming they ask because of reasons like this. How do they know If I sent it to my own wallet or sent it to someone elses and received cash in person?

Thanks! :)

Absolutely...I love the hidden account/multi passphrase security feature. It's such a cool concept that I'd never thought of but makes perfect sense.

Haha. I guess you didn't read what I wrote. I said I don't want to spend bitcoin...just buy and save. Thanks for the concern though.
Also there are multi passphrase encryption options with trezor to create hidden wallets and ultimately stop the $5 wrench attack (or gun)

Are there more people talking about this firewall issue? Isn't it something we should be very concerned about?

I don't mean to come off as a jerk but...are you really asking that question?
