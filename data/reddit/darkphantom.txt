That is false. If Bitcoin Cash had the same volume of transactions, the fees would be the same as now because the blocks would still not be full.

There are many factors that influence the market. The current valuation of the market does not affect the fact that increasing the size of the blocks so that they are not full causes the fees to fall to a minimum.

You're welcome :D

Thank you

Apparently I do not agree very much with you because I have you with some negative points in RES (maybe for some comment of yours in I do not know, I do not pay much attention to the usernames) but I fully share the feeling of your comment. Long ago I unsubscribed from this sudreddit and today I decided to make some comments and feel as you describe :(

I did not know that modified its rules to push a particular agenda. Nor did I know that they decided to apply some rules and others not arbitrarily. Can you give me some links about that please?

Sorry, I usually consider the term negatively (maybe because English is not my main language). Much more considering the context: manipulation of the CSS for example or that several developers consider that a hard fork without a high consensus is bad and at the same time they are moderators and decide that it is not possible to speak of alternative clients preventing them to reach consensus (basically a conflict of interests ).

I'm not putting words in your mouth, I'm asking if that's what happened in because that's what I consider to "push an agenda." If your definition is different then tell me.
I have not been part of many forums but I am lurker in many subreddits and I have not seen many that behave like this, and as you mentioned another subreddit I was curious to know if there happened the same thing that happened in this. But it does not make sense that I continue with the conversation if you do not think to answer that.

Sorry, my mistake. Long time ago I did not enter this subreddit and remembered badly the list of moderators.
With respect to CSS, I know most of the subreddits have some custom style. You know I do not mean that when I say manipulation, but to hide deleted comments so that users do not know that they really are missing comments (I do not know if they keep doing it now)

You do not understand, they are *ready* to start implementing segwit... at some point.

Are you saying that those rules were not from the beginning but the moderators changed them and that affected a minority a lot? Are you saying that changing those rules prevented certain topics from being discussed in the subreddit even though many considered them to be fundamental issues to be discussed in the subreddit? Are you saying that the moderators changed the CSS style, the default order of certain posts and the time that is hidden karma, everything so that many users do not realize how they were implementing the new rules? 
Because that's what I call "pushing an agenda". What most subreddits do is to define rules with common sense and apply them to everyone alike, and once the subreddit is large they do not change the rules abruptly just because moderators want it.

I know. I should have put /s.

A source about that please?
