Lots can change in cryptos in 2 years. 6 months ago we were at hitting $18k.

So one  “seems sound” report linking it to the crazy spike in 2017. Ok, possible that happened but doesnt mean its happening all the time. They've stopped issuing Tether from the beginning of this year.

Nobody said the big crash happened because of the downward manipulation so don't make up your own story there.

Care to expand on that? Any proof/evidence to the contrary or is it personal opinion?

This is Global Govt Debt? So Public sector owes to the Private sector? This mean on average every man woman and child are indebted $35k to some faceless private hedge fund/organization. (This is Indentured Servitude, a form of slavery)

" his December call for the digital currency to reach [$20,000]( by mid-2018 missed the mark by about $14,000. ". If your predictions are not coming true lie low for a while..

Not as far fetched as you would think
US owes $260 billion to the colossus of a country Cayman Islands - 
Enlighten yourself.

Agree. One of the stupidest comparisons I've seen.

Yet prices are falling which is weird unless its being artificially driven down. Seems like the pressure is building for a big jump up.

The "free" things will always have faster adoption like youtube and facebook. Things that cost money e.g. cars, computers, etc will take longer. So with Bitcoin it will always take longer as its not free there is a certain technological barrier that needs to be overcome.
Also there are only \~17 million Bitcoins in circulation at the moment, that works against it. It will change hands much more as people buy and sell but the number of people using it wont grow exponentially. (unless the price goes up like crazy and 1 Satoshi is worth something like $1).
But in 9 years i think its already in the double digit millions and with the speed its growing I think 50 million is not so far away. With the anonymous nature of Bitcoin will we ever find out?

Its a very very long shot - odds of 140/1. It would mean Bitcoin increasing like crazy and also Berkshire Hathaway falling away like crazy. Both seem improbable at this time. Only way possible would be if Bitcoin became a recognized used currency and if Warren Buffett passes away and his successor completely fucks up the company.
