This is exactly what I mean. What kind of response even is this? You can't even offer a solution to what you think is a problem that would make sense on a large scale, just gibberish and nonsense.

Not even remotely what I said but nice try straw manning there.


Not an argument.


Not an argument.


Not an argument.


Your only attempt at an argument doesn't even make sense. Why does every Libertarian's solution to everything end up with poor people just moving to make way for rich people? So I should just move if I can't afford to use your imaginary Libertarian roads to somewhere with no rich people? So glad Libertarians don't actually have any power in this country lol.

Where I live we have private roads. One road in particular called the Greenway costs $5 to use one way. If only private corporations made roads you'd be charged whatever they want to charge you just to get from point A to point B without damaging your vehicle on some crumbling rocks. Eventually only the wealthy will be able to afford to use roads if all roads were privatised. 
But whenever I bring that up to a Libertarian, I never get a logical response. Just some Temporarily Embarrassed Millionaire crap or talking about how the roads wouldn't make any money if they charged too much which doesn't really make any sense- you people think MontBlanc ($300+ ink pens) is hurting for business because poor people can't afford them? Lmao. There's an over abundance of rich people where I live who could afford $50 one way to use a private road 5 days a week. Pricing people like you and me out of using roads if they were all private. So yeah it's pretty damned important for the government to keep making the vast majority of roads.
