@_date: 2014-11-13 20:46:31
What are you talking about, he seems to be asking a question when a user spontaneously tips him 2 Dollars.
Read the context, he didn't even redeem the bitcoins man... 
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:02:44
Oh, awesome since i'm in texas trying to grow awareness for BTC too, the laws are very lenient but can you point me in the direction for registering with fed?
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:03:41
No, not at all

2 btc is not a lot, not sure why people wont fund darkwallet, its something that could be quite useful
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:54:37
Very interesting, thanks for this.
@_date: 2015-04-20 15:44:13
How many people attended this event?
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:59:21
As much as I love the bitcoins for merchants and how valuable it can be for them, I hope that the killer app will speed up consumers adoption of bitcoins as merchants can only accept bitcoins once consumers start spending them. 
Thanks for the link though, I am reading now!
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:03:14
Much appreciated, another to compare for.
@_date: 2015-04-23 03:59:09
I too would like to know this, its a huge amount of coins, but people seem to just shrug is off as its never coming back. 
I'm sure there are some individuals who are tracking the coins though, I mean the Sheep dude got caught eventually and the Evo guys one day may too... hopefully we figure out the MtGox
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:32:35
I'd really like to get in touch, yeah im wary of skyhook, but I have many potential clients which helps me.
edit: I'd like most of my clients to be in and out quickly, it seems like transactions may take up to a minute for skyhook which kind of lets me down :(
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:49:16
Or Sing a song that is actually a public wallet key that you can sing bitcoins to!
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:31:02
So another week?
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:55:03
I first came into this place as a non-belieber, not actually in "this" place, it was the conecpt of bitcoin back in 2010 or so when price was around 33 per coin, I waved it off as nonsense, then it hit 256, then it hit 1200, I was a believer... I purchased coin when It was 500 and thought of it as an investment...
price has gone down by over 50% now, but during that time i've read about bitcoin and how truly transcending of a technology it is and whatever it may do, I know its the future, I think its a mix of both, as investor and a legit currency, bitcoin is what you want it to be.
Don't let others tell you what it is!

Proceed to buy bitcoins with that grant.
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:55:21
Skyhook seems most economically sound for me currently, I want to dip my toes into Bitcoin and I don't want to fully invest and so skyhook seems viable, I do have a small clientele too so I hope it can do well :)
@_date: 2015-04-09 18:04:41
Proceed with caution
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:43:41
infiltrating has some what of a negative connotation :(
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:20:03

@_date: 2015-03-09 16:06:05
I also accept bitcoins online, i noticed that giving an incentive to use btc really helped with sales.
Glad you accepted though! Welcome to the club!
@_date: 2015-03-19 21:53:19
