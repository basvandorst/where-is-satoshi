So you don't have any useful answer?

You early bitcoin adopters are funny. You’re such fans just because it multiplied your investment by 20+. And you sure don’t know/care about the tech while acting like it’s a cult or something. When shit hits the fan (goes below your buy price) you’ll be the first screaming and selling. Now you’re making fun of “shitcoins”. But guys, people who buy “shitcoin” are like you. They want to multiply their investment. They just came later and managed to multiply their money too. Even faster. Bitcoin is old tech. Don’t act as if it were the tech of the future. Look at the tech. It’s dinosaur. “Shitcoins” are better versions of the original blockchain. And if you’re too much of a pussy to try and play, that’s too bad for you. Because Bitcoin won’t give you much more money.

Yep but don't you think that it will in fact never have that expected low price? As a lot of people will buy when the price is low.

Let's be honest. Most of investors didn't invest because of the technology. They don't care.
