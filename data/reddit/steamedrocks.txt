My access to the internet is something I value and use daily. I'm not saying I have it worse than those kids but I legitimately don't have food and I'm broke
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:54:26
I'll try it

Nah I'm friends with them and I'd be embarrassed to see them after asking for money.

I don't use any crypto, just thought there might be some people throwing money around here. The return on this investment: a tender hug from me if we ever meet irl
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:17:24
I'm hungry
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:10:35
I'm only 21, I'm trying my best. My mother died when I was 18 and I never knew my dad. I'll repay you by making you a song in FL Studio

I don't use crypto, just thought you guys might have some money. I'm really really hungry.
@_date: 2018-01-19 04:05:39
dude I'm so hungry, please

I need my car to work, I live several miles away and it's the middle of winter. I don't get paid til next week. I know I can technically "survive" but I feel fucking awful, I'm already underweight as it is.
You can order me a pizza or something so you know i'm not just using it for meth or whatever. i'd be really grateful yo
