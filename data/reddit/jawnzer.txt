Awesome, I was just thinking last night how I would like to grab a tshirt but couldn't remember any sites. Will be purchasing after lunch!
A bitcoin Canada shirt would be awesome ;)
Edit: the shipping to Canada is really quite expensive, any chance at re evaluating it?

Account made today, linking to underpriced bitcoins. Think I'll pass.

I just purchased my first little bit of bitcoin a couple of days ago. Same boat as you, just reading and reading and following market trends pretty closely. 
But it's a lot different when you have some to actually play with. Have already made two purchases with it, excited to see them come in!
@_date: 2013-11-14 01:02:22
Awesome, purchased quite a bit of these. Anything nostalgia is a instant purchase for me.
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:34:00
How much are they going to cost?
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:29:34
There is a few reasons why I love Bitcoin, number one as someone has touched on, the revolution of it. Being the pioneers of something so great. Also it's a easy, low cost investment, that isn't hard to understand.

God damn, top contributor has 27 th/s....
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:11:13
Awesome! 
Not sure if you seen my edit about the shipping price to Canada though. It's more than 2x the purchase price?
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:56:20
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:31:49
Ahhhh okay, that makes sense. So it would work better to be doing something like this with a external HDD if I were to do this.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:51:47
Love all the companies and bitcoin related things coming out in Canada.
@_date: 2013-10-23 01:26:50
Craigslist is non existent in Canada, at least on the west coast it is.
@_date: 2013-07-04 16:46:01
I just hope the price can stay a little low like this till I can afford some more...
@_date: 2013-07-02 16:10:54
Ok, awesome. Thank you!

I am trying to symlink (Mac) my wallet.DAT file to a encrypted image on drop box, but when ever I enter terminal and enter in the code it responds with illegal operation. Am I missing something, or is something like that not possible to do with a disk image?
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:25:54
Awesome, appreciate it. Will order two shirts now.
First bitcoin purchase as well!
@_date: 2013-07-26 16:12:41
I'm, in Canada. So not sure why it doesn't work...
@_date: 2013-07-04 16:50:24
Hope I'm not too late!
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:36:45
This would be perfect, use my Galaxy Nexus (that's not hooked up to any network) as my authenticator and have other information stored there.
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:12:38
Got it all sorted I believe, just trying to figure out if I actually sent the bitcoin hahah

Two bitcoin t shirts
6 packs of Simpsons, and TMNT retro playing cards
Holographic stickers for wallets.

WCTR =/= company, he's not offering but a retailer will be.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:30:53
And I would be able to do something like that with automator. Sorry, not the best with computers
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:04:21
Me too?
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:10:23
I know it's a pain, but I was verified in under an hour there, and I am still waiting with cavirtex after a few weeks.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:20:42
If I were to say PPC, what exchange would you use?
@_date: 2013-10-30 20:13:54
Awesome really it! I have been during with Brian and he told me the same thing.
@_date: 2013-07-02 04:25:49
Great read, I really did learn a lot. Really opened my eyes to a few different things.
As someone who isn't into the bitcoin stocks, where should I start? 
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:36:51
Exact reason why I held off on picking them up. With everyone getting their asics' now, you'll never get your roi.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:41:30
Great interview
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:06:13
Awesome, I really hope that they can take some action against these pricks.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:40:59
I'd you want a memory intensive wallet armoury is it.
They didn't focus on trying to make it run fast, but be the most secure. In the next addition of their wallet they plan on making it less memory intensive

Not necessarily bitcoin related, but I am wondering how to symlink my Bitcoin folder to a disk image. I am using a mac, and when I go through the process it tells me it is a illegal process?   
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:26:54
Nice to see, will be making a deposit there in the next week or so. Won't take much for them to over take virtex.
@_date: 2013-10-30 06:38:40
Awesome, great read. I have been following bitcoin for about 5 months now but have an awful memory so it was a good refresh.
Going to finally dive in and get my first bitcoin tonight, can't stand to wait any longer!
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:17:22
Yeah was flipping through that as well. They have a site listed in Calgary, right by my place, and there is nothing there. Also their phone number is a California number that is disconnected.
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:01:53
You say credit unions, is servus on that list? I know they said it will be a month or so before they get their online transfers up and running, but just wondering. If not, I will go and grab a student account for this.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:59:50
High five, good shit man.
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:48:43
Do you have any other sha-256 currencies?
@_date: 2013-11-13 14:29:53
I tried emailing them and they refused to respond to me regarding how legit they're. This I'd the response I got back from them
Please stop making accusations of this nature or we will immediately begin
a lawsuit against you for ruining our image if you make any kind of posts.
I haven't responded to your email because you are aggressive and we don't
want to do business with you. The phone number was assigned by our phone
service provider, but we are in the process of transferring to a new
provider with a valid Canada phone number.
As I said, immediately stop any intents to ruin our image or we will use
the law to recover our investment you will ruin.
You have 24 hours to respond or this conversations will be sent to our
legal department.

When are you looking to have an app ready b
@_date: 2013-11-01 18:05:50
Hoping Servus will get on board when their online transfer part is up and running. My other bank account is a visa debit, and I have heard those cause some major problems so hoping servus comes through for me.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:01:12
Just so I am not storing it directly on my computer. It's not totally necessary, but was reading a few things and thought I would try it out.
