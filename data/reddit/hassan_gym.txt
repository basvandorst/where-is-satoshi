Been using Coinsquare for a while. UI website and mobile app are legit good.
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:12:25
All about longterm.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:48:23
Bought the dip today. Cya next year.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:18:47
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:50:44
Did you buy the dip though?
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:04:08
Coinsquare.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:18:02
This is great. Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:46:05
Like Coinsquare.

Great work brother.
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:16:34
All the way to the moon now.
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:50:33
Use Coinsquare instead. They offer more coins, and they've lost 0 coin [according to their CEO] w/ little to no delay/bugs [they have a mobile app as well]. Message me for more info.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:31:27
Bitcoin to the moon.
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:07:09
Is Coinsquare on Segwit? Can someone check?!
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:20:17
Amazing article. This is what we need.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:10:46
I don't care because I got some Dogecoin as well baby.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:11:28
Is Coinsquare w/ Segwit?
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:15:45
Litecoin is not a competitor of Bitcoin. If anything, it is an ally. This sub thinks that everything in this tech space is there to compete with Bitcoin. Litecoin made it clear to supplement and aid Bitcoin's latest issues (transaction speed, bottleneck, etc.)
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:33:00
Or... Use Coinsquare. Message me for more information.

A lot of folks at aren't necessarily about "investing" but more about "old-traditional-investments". It's funny because crypto/Bitcoin outperformed most of the garbage investments some of the people on or &amp; other subreddits suggest (i.e Lyft, Ford, Pinterest, Zoom, etc.)
FYI crypto is only \~10-15% of my wealth, the rest is in the stock market or in cash.
@_date: 2019-07-05 03:24:45
I've been holding since 2017, never sold. Just hold.
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:27:32
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:19:41
I'm buying the dip.

They're the heroes we need, but do not deserve.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:58:51
I also had to explain Bitcoin to few coworkers last Friday. HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:59:18
I check Bitcoin while I'm pumping iron at the gym and reminding myself how life is good.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:02:45
Use Coinsquare.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:09:16

I think people need to educate others about Bitcoin. Post on your Snapchat/Instagram stories about Bitcoin. Talk about it with your family and friends. Let the world know about this invention &amp; investment.
As y'all say, HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:00:09
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:09:50
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:05:55
death, tax, HODL.
@_date: 2018-09-04 02:39:49
Wasn't it under 1 BTC at the beginning of the year? Amazing for real.
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:01:50
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:01:14
Bull run will be crazy by the end of the year.
@_date: 2018-08-26 13:00:03
\# of current slightly improved, I've been monitoring it since \~January. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 05:28:25
Great company btw, I use it its amazing.
@_date: 2018-06-19 14:29:43
I use it, it's amazing.
@_date: 2019-08-12 00:15:50
@_date: 2019-08-11 21:13:03
Square has done an amazing job w/ their Cash app. I would argue that it introduced Bitcoin to many investors in the financials industry.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:26:31
LeFuck You mode.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:46:04
The crash lasted like a year. But anyways, jump in.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:53:48
Cash App is what you should be using now.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:36:52
Most people do not have the ability to day trade. 99% of people will be better off just to buy, hold, focus on other things in life (hobbies, passions, relationships, etc.) and monitor their gains longterm. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 05:06:10
Just use e-transfer to Coinsquare or Quadrica. Higher fees, but in the long run the initial fees won't matter.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:08:17
The king always gets the blame when times are tough.

Investing teaches you something very valuable; patience.

Does he have an instagram? I'll follow this man.
@_date: 2018-02-13 03:20:55
I'm concerned that you had to pay your rent off your Bitcoin investments.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:59:57
Final Flash?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:55:56
Nah, I love tech stocks as much as I love Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-21 03:59:41
Remember all the guys freaking out last month, saying Bitcoin will go down straight to 2k? Yeah I remember.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:16:17
This man deserves Bitcoin donations.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:12:11
Bad publicity is good publicity.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:59:10
Too many people freaking out, it's crazy. Relax.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:16:17
This dad is a beast.
@_date: 2018-02-24 18:16:33
No, people are too stupid for investing though.
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:18:48
Here we go baby.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:10:09
People are freaking out. Relax.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:10:43
It'll be back up in the 20K's. Technology hasn't slowed down, only people's interest until something sparks it up again.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:57:57
IMO, everyone that owns Bitcoin should own some Litecoin. And vice versa.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:56:49
Never bought one of his courses and never will. However, I watched a lot of his YT videos and so on. If you take out the whole marketting aspect (buy my courses, etcetc), he actually does spill out some good advice (about investing in general, personality traits' analysis, etc.) At the end of the day, he has motivated more people to read books which is a good thing, regardless of what his intentions are.
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:34:45
I think we're hitting 20K USD sooner than people think.
@_date: 2018-07-03 03:07:38
What's your point?
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:33:41
Here we go.
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:38:06
That's the plan, haha.
@_date: 2018-07-20 03:41:39
This is good.
@_date: 2018-07-04 16:12:53
  The stock market follows the same principle, although not as low as -25&amp;
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:38:07
I'm looking forward for breaking the 25K USD.
@_date: 2018-07-04 22:33:58
I've done the same, but no increase at all. :-(
@_date: 2018-07-03 14:27:48
Doing my best to change that. Thanks for the feedback man.
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:07:54
Need to HODL long term.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:33:59
I accept BTC, and I do tutor students.
@_date: 2018-04-15 15:08:19
I've lost almost 5 digits from Cryptocurrency investments. Longterm people, longterm you'll be fine.
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:20:39
Bitcoin opened doors to many other technologies.
@_date: 2018-04-12 22:02:30
Longterm we'll be fine.
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:38:57
Still not sure how to integrate Bitcoin payments through WordPress.
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:34:31
I accept BTC/LTC, and I run a business tutoring students.
