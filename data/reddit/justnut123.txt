I think no one really knows where there price will go, but as soon as it spikes for a week no doubt, someone will put out a YouTube video saying why it happened and price predictions.

I’m interested in this cause I got stung before as well with a wire transfer just say you transferred 10000 AUD to a CAD bank. You will only get about 7k CAD.
If you did it in bitcoin how does the conversion and fees work?

Me to I like reading the comments there are 2 types of threads. The “bash every developer or business involves because the price is going down, longggg bash thread”. The second type is the “stay positive thread, give history facts on prices”.

This is the thing I don’t understand. Bitcoin is based on fiat money?
So .. if there is no fiat money how does bitcoin survive

I agree someone wants to be the authority on why it crashed, cause he has no idea. Can only post when it goes back up , what a dick

I think he means it slaves your mind as your attached to the price 24/7

If you want to know just watch YouTube videos that are always right for price speculation.
