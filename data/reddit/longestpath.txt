Got it so what makes it more secure than a mobile wallet on an iOS or Android device that also gives you a recovery phrase?
Is the idea that you only use the key to recover and not while the device is working?

That's what I thought. Ty. But I suppose if you only use the phrase rarely to restore the wallet it's more secure but the wallet otherwise has a chip to do the signing and encryption pieces onboard without exposing the PK to the PC.

Seed phrase == private key?

Jaxx looks like it does. But it's not on the Bitcoin.org site. Interesting.

Which ones support the other chains though in the same app?

Excellent comment. Ty. The only thing: if TREZOR are villains they may have already stolen your private key and seed. Is there any protection or guarantee or audit against that?

Why does a bigger block size make it harder to run a full node?

But the futures market could have activity even without bcc existing right? It's futures that are being traded? Where do you see this info?

Why would an 8 mb block size mean a lot t of storage? Doesn't the storage need scale with the number of transactions rather than how many and what size blocks they are broken into?
